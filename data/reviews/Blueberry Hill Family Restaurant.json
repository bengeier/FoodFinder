{"text":"This is a great restaurant!  Went here multiple times with our 4 kids.  The food is so yummy, especially the pancakes and bacon!  The waitstaff was wonderful.  We will go back!!!    Kids plates were adult size servings, so consider having little ones share.  We always had leftovers.  The value for the money was right for our budget."}
{"text":"My party of 6 was skipped for 45 minutes by numerous groups. After becoming impatient and hungry, tried to ask the employee who was no help and terribly unorganized. Finally sat down, food was not fresh, potatoes were cold, and servers rarely came to the table. Don't fall for the lines this place isn't worth a dime"}
{"text":"One of the few places open on Thanksgiving for lunch in Vegas. Turkey dish looked promising from the sample. Reality was hard to deal with. Contrary to the sample, there were absolutely no vegetables (replaced with corn). But the worse was the taste and looks of everything. Most of the ingredients looked extremely cheap, artificial and had no taste whatsoever. All of us barely ate 1/4 of the dish and had to stop, despite being very hungry. Hoped for the pies, just to find out they were not any better and ultra sweet. A true shame."}
{"text":"We really like this restaurant. We love tbeir pancakes and coffee. We take our family there.  We love breakfast there. We recommend them."}
{"text":"Fantastic place to sit and chill, get some pie a la mode and a coffee and just relax. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I loved having breakfast here! Definitely will return when I am in Vegas. The Irish eggs Benedict were delicious!"}
{"text":"My friend and I swung in her last night around 10:30 after a show at the Smith Center. Both of us had missed dinner and were starving. The place was pretty dark and empty looking but once inside we found three or four other tables of late night eaters. As a whole this place is kind of a greasy spoon and a bit sticky but that really didn't bother us. I ordered the waffle breakfast with eggs and sausage and the portion was huge. My friend got the same thing only with pancakes instead. We both really liked what we had and seriously loved the butter they used. The service was fine nothing good or bad to say about that and the price was right at $24 for both of our meals and two coffees. Certainly be someplace when a late night breakfast craving hits."}
{"text":"Best pancakes in town. Service is usually very friendly and efficient. Weekend mornings can be crazy...."}
{"text":"Only gave 2 stars, because when I mentioned Military discount the lady behind the register looked at me like I was crazy, she said \"no discounts here, we don't even get employee discounts\" REALLY, !!! Employee discounts !!. I did more for this country in Iraq, than that lady will do her life at the restaurant, Your welcome lady !!!! I think she could of been a little more appreciative."}
{"text":"They sat us very quickly, even as a party of 6.  They have a full diner menu and serve extra large portions."}
{"text":"As we were in Vegas for a presentation at the Clark County library went \"next door\" toeat. Please see photos for details...canned/frozen veggies instead of fresh....others after us received fressh veggies although they said they had none. Served mashed potatoes instead of baked and as they were repairing pur plates the steaks aling with friends veggies became cold. Bug crawled across table and I caught it in my napkin...didn't seem to phase waitress!  Friend ordered FRESH STRAWBERRY CAKE that DIDN'T HAVE ONE SLICE OF STRAWBERRIES!  THAT WAS IT! No manager on duty. Spoke with manager on phone...no help. Excuses"}
{"text":"Love this place. Every time we're in Vegas, we have to eat breakfast here at least once. As the name implies, they serve many blueberry specialties...  pancakes, waffles, crepes. All are yummy."}
{"text":"I'm giving the Hill a star bump!  I've now been here at least 25 times and I can't get enough!  I've had every sandwich on the menu and I love 'em all.  This is the sort of place where the waitress calls you \"honey\" and your soda is never empty :)"}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped here for breakfast.  We were seated immediately, and the waitress was very nice and prompt with coffee refills.  They have a huge range of options for breakfast, and almost everything is made there, not boxed or frozen, which is always a plus.  I had the Chicken Apple Compote Waffle, and the waffle and honey butter was amazing.  I'd probably go back to this place for the delicious looking, fluffy pankcakes or some homemade pie."}
{"text":"Service was awesome, we didn't have much of a wait.  It was a busy Saturday morning. We had the omelet and the chicken and waffles with fried apples.  The portions were large. The omelet was good, the chicken could have used a little more flavor but all in all pretty satisfied."}
{"text":"I declare this the best diner in Las Vegas.  I ordered the corned beef hash with scrambled eggs and hash browns.  Corned Beef Hash: I'm always surprised at how different each diner will prepare the corned beef hash. This version offered tender diced onions along with crispy and salty corned beef. It was really good. Some places make their hash really mushy, but Blueberry Hill cooks it to the right consistency in my book. Crispy, but still moist.  Eggs: Surprisingly better than most places. The eggs had a silky smooth texture to it. I'm guessing they used a dash of cream in it.  Hash Browns: Best hash browns i've had at a diner. It was your typical shredded potatoes, however the hash browns were cooked to crisp perfection."}
{"text":"Perfect greasy spoon diner.  I agree with the review about the French Toast being so good that it doesn't need syrup.  The French Toast is absolutely amazing.  But, this should not discount the pancakes.  They are, without question, the best buttermilk pancakes that I have ever tasted.  On this, there can be no debate.  They absolutely melt in your mouth.  With them both on the table, it is completely impossible to stop eating.  I am glad that I don't live here as I would almost certainly have diabetes within a year if I knew that I could get pancakes this good any time I wanted.  If you like pancakes or French Toast, this is a must try for any trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"Little Boy Goop. I used to love coming here, but I feel like it's going down hill.  The service left a lot to be desired and the food was not on par.  Let's start off with the service. The server was polite, just forgetful and not attentive.  Not enough place settings, when I did ask for one when my food arrived, she went and checked on other people and eventually realized I still needed silverware.  My food came out without English muffins and when she brought them out, they were not properly toasted.  The Little Boy Blue, blueberry pancakes came out and it looked like they took Blueberry Jelly and just scooped it on the pancakes.  Very unappealing. The scrambled eggs were rubbery.  The quesadilla was bland.  Overall, like a 1 1/2 star experience.  If I do come back it won't be for a very long time."}
{"text":"If your looking to have a big breakfast at a small price come here hungry food is amazing ."}
{"text":"Based on the positive reviews on yelp for the food and good service, my family and I decided to visit the Blueberry Hill restaurant today. Unfortunately, the experience didn't meet our expectations.   While the food was as advertised, the service was miserable. Our waitress got our order wrong then blamed us. \"No, that's what you ordered.\"  She says this defiantly in front of 7 people who know she's wrong. It also didn't help that she charged us an extra $7 for a side of sausage and bacon when the menu says $1.69.   We also had to request refills on coffee while the rest of the restaurant seemed to be taken care of.  Overall, very negative experience. Would not recommend this place or at the very least this location thanks to poor service from our waitress \"Ashley\"."}
{"text":"Omelettes are weird looking but they taste really good. Always tasty if you like breakfast joints."}
{"text":"Place is a maze za zing.... Let's me put a egg sunny side on a bacon cheese burger. Great great great place !!!!!"}
{"text":"I wish I could have tried a pancake. . . I came here the morning/afternoon of the Las Vegas Rock and Roll Marathon on 12/04/2011. I ate smart with a healthy breakfast of protein and some toast for carbs. It was good and I was satisfied but I really wanted a pancake. My fiance got chicken and waffles which looked very good and I would have loved a bite but before I knew it his plate was empty and I wasn't offered any. It must have been a good meal."}
{"text":"Went last night.....late last night with 5 friends. the only order that was received correctly was the toast. they tried to pass American cheese as cheddar cheese, the iced tea tasted as though it was brewed with some sort of fungus, and perhaps they thought we could not tell the difference between french fries and onion rings. here is the kicker, once these things were identified no effort was made by the establishment to correct their errors."}
{"text":"A true old school diner! Plates full of enough food to soak up tanks of alcohol or cure that \"why do I do this to myself\" hangover. Mmmmm chicken and waffles please and thank you!!"}
{"text":"Being from the eastcoast,i am used to diners...no no real diners not ihop or denny's. They are cool places just not considered a real diner to me!.i stumbled across blueberry hill while going to the 99 cent store and decided to have some lunch. Place is clean, they had a great selection on the menu plus specials. Waitress was rude and a lil ghetto but she got my order right, even though she left all the coffee cups on the table then try to charge my wife and i for coffee we didnt have. All and all i t was descent so this wasnt my last. Fast forward 10 plus times ive been here, they changed the menu.well should i say condensed it down and took away items that i loved. Food is good , but i feel like cutting the menu down in size makes me feel like im at denny's(school cafeteria). All and all its a step up from dennys and ihop. It is not amazing. Ive been to different locations and they each have their own feel and faults."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, good coffee. Sausage was greasy though. Men's restroom was clean bit graffiti was scratched into mirror. Waitress was friendly, service was quick, I got my plate in about 10 minutes of ordering.  Overall, I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"They were extremely busy.  We were seated quickly.  Our server, Linda H, made sure our coffee was full.  Our breakfast came out fast considering how busy they were.  Everything was delicious.   I had the full house. The crepes were perfect. My friend had the waitress special with eggs over medium. The eggs were cooked to perfection and tasted very fresh.  The waffle had great flavor.   Great experience on a busy Saturday morning.  ,,"}
{"text":"Very good, especially after a hard night of clubbing."}
{"text":"I love this place!! Everything was delicious!! I would definitely come back great coffee nice service.."}
{"text":"Best pancakes in Vegas and Cali! We try to eat here every time we are in Vegas. Service and food are always fantastic!"}
{"text":"We came from Los Angeles CA,  and wanted to get away from las vegas strip, so we yelp this place well I'm glad we did. The portions are huge, the food was very good. The pancakes were fresh and very thick. Service was good. I recommend this place"}
{"text":"I came in a little before the normal dinner time. I ordered the special which was pot roast. It came with potatoes and celery that were cooked with the Pot Roast. First of all, the food: Great pot roast. Tender and tasty, the sides were good as well.  Now, the service:  Promptly greeted and seated. Order was taken quickly. And then it deteriorated rapidly. Was brought the salad, the food arrived before I had time to finish it, that's kind of normal. I had ordered coffee for a drink. My waitress never checked on me during the course of the meal. She sat at the counter and ate. I understand that employees need to eat, but in my restaurant experience, you make sure another waitress covers your tables. I had to wave down the other waitress to get more coffee. The special included dessert. My waitress brought my check, I had to make a point of desiring dessert, she made no mention of it. She cleared my table, taking my silverware, then brought the pie I ordered (very good apple pie by the way). She didn't bring a fork with it. So I'm now sitting with apple pie in front of me with no means to eat it. It took a few minutes to locate my waitress and get her to bring me a fork, which she did in what almost seemed a begrudging manner.  I've been here more than a few times to eat, and to be fair have experienced excellent service in the past. This experience was definitely out of the norm for this restaurant.  As I enjoy eating here, I hope it's not a trend."}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars I would. On Sunday 2/8/15 my family went to have breakfast. About 4 bites into my egg white omelette, I looked down and found a dead cockroach cooked in my food. ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING. Will never eat at any blueberry hill establishment ever again."}
{"text":"Fantastic!!! Definitely recommend. The hours are convenient because it's always open. The food is delicious and the service was friendly and welcoming. I recommend you get the pancakes with strawberries. I personally am not a fan of pancakes but you don't understand what good pancakes are until you've eaten these!!! So fluffy and warm and the strawberries are a perfect compliment as they are real strawberries. The French toast is also great!! Nice amount of sweetness to it. Also the enchiladas are great they definitely are generous with beans and rice and with the meat inside the enchiladas. It is fantastic!!! I highly suggest you come here."}
{"text":"Nice big place off the strip. Very good prices and huge portions. Service was excellent. Would definitely recommend. Their 4-egg omelet was massive."}
{"text":"While Im at work Im pretty limited to breakfast options and going to the same place over and over just gets boring.  On this morning I decided on Blueberry Hill, why not!  The last time I stopped in was about 10 years ago and it was probably good then, I just dont remember.    Anyhew, as soon as we get close , I can tell the parking lot is packed.  I figure if its too long of a wait I can always go back to my normal spot.  As soon as we walk in we are greeted and sat immediatly-not bad for a packed place.  Our server was Jennifer and she was wonderful.  Super attentive and nice.  Our coffee and waters were brought out pretty quickly and Jennifer even offered flavored creamers that wernt stored in the caddies on the tables.   As for breakfast, I ordered pretty much the standard, two eggs over medium, bacon and hashbrowns w/ sourdough toast.  My friend ordered a huge ham and cheese omelet with sourdough toast and the biggest side of buttermilk pancakes ever.  My goodness, they were like an inch thick each and there was three of them.  Sourdough toast was of good quality ( nothing worse than cheap bread) and my god--- why was the coffee so good?  Its probably some generic bulk coffee they buy but it was delicious!  My only beef of the whole meal would probably be the hashbrowns.  I had what would be equal to a 1/2 of cup worth that was spread out onto my plate.  A little less stingy on those would have been great but lets face it, I probably wouldnt have finished them anyways!  Overall, service was great, food was good and pricing was fair!"}
{"text":"This place is the cleanest and nicest blueberry hill restaurant! Staff have been here for years. Friendly and clean. You should always come here when you visit Vegas!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food with big portions! Bedt chicken and waffles....I can't wait to come back. Best breakfast in Vegas!"}
{"text":"My partner and I love to come here for breakfast, that we have became regulars.  It's a Las Vegas Jem, I will recommend to locals and non locals. Tip: check out the special on the wall before taking a seat, great deals."}
{"text":"Oh my, I love breakfast and if you do too then this is the place to go!  Blueberry Hill has been around for years and they have it down to a science! It's busy on the weekend but they run through the list quick, get you seated and take your order than bam! here comes your food!  It's a huge menu so whatever you and your fellow diners are in the mood for you can all get it.  My honey had the WAITRESS SPECIAL and I ordered the MEAT LOVER SKILLET.  The waffles are sweet cream and so is the soft whipped butter - yummay! My skillet came with a side of salsa, which I loved.  There are a few locations in town, but none on the west side :(  It had been probably 20 years since my last visit but I won't be waiting that long next time!"}
{"text":"I used to go here twice a month! I Remember why. Not a fancy place, it's a diner. The food is big portion and big on taste! I'd recommend this place for sure."}
{"text":"Strawberry crepes are the bees knees!! Absolutely in love! They're always consistent no matter what time of day! Thanks BBhills!:)"}
{"text":"Great comfort food. Try the coconut cake, not to sweet, moist , just delicious"}
{"text":"Really good food and reasonably priced. Don't even think about showing up without your entire party, even if theres only 2, they wont seat you, and parking is a pain."}
{"text":"Consistency for a dinner I have gone to for over a decade. Nothing crazy unique here on the menu, but service is quick, prices are fair, and food quality is always great."}
{"text":"When in Vegas, eat whatever the heck you want for breakfast. So I got the Oreo pancakes. Seriously, they were amazing!!! The pancakes pretty much melted in my mouth, and the icing was delicious that went on top. My husband got the western omelette, which was also delicious."}
{"text":"My family is torn: one half wants to find a Mexican restaurant for breakfast, the other half wants Denny's.   This place was a helpful combination of \"all the above\" + fried chicken/waffles.  In sum: if you have one dish in mind, you can probably find a better version in Vegas; however, if your family has different ideas, this is a good compromise (in the best sense of the word)."}
{"text":"I was introduced to this place as a lowly college student, in Vegas with my roommates on a weekend getaway from college (in LA), and we had friend who lived just around the corner, and they took us their for breakfast....and it was DELISH!!    Fast Forward 15 YEARS...Apparently It Left An Impression....  In Vegas With My Co-Workers For A Paul Mitchell Convention....and I Was In Charge Of The Agenda Which Was To Include Meals...So We Didn't Argue....So Of Course My First Thought Was That We Were Going To Come Here For Breakfast One Day.  I Had Talked It Up To My Team...and Let Me Say, When We First Got There...They Were Like WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU TAKING US??!!  It Is A Little In The Ghetto....And The Restaurant Looks Like It Could Use Some Renovation Love....But They Love and Trust Me...So We Went It....LUCKILY...It Was BUSY...But Not Out The Door Busy (Like It Can Get)....We Sat Down Had The Most AMAZING and SPUNKY Waitress....Browsed The Menu (I Know What I Was Having Biscuits and Gravy).  Everyone Ordered, Still A Little Skeptical, It Is Just Your Standard Breakfast Joint Menu....UNTILL THE FOOD CAME....Then No One Spoke...Just Ate.  Ate Their Food...Ate Off Each Others Plates....Wanted More...But Were Too Full To Think About More Food.  I Had Redeemed Myself In The Eyes Of My Co-Workers With The Best Breakfast In Vegas......We Still Talk About The Pancakes....Biscuit and Gravy and The OMLETTA....  Mind you...we know the meal clogged our arteries just a little....but we made up for it, with some well deserved shopping cardio right afterwards....We can't wait for next years training....!!    Oh and PS:  When We Left....It Was Out The Door Line....and That's Always A Good Sign!!!"}
{"text":"Came here tonight for the first time to this location. It's a new location and it's fairly big,when we got there I asked the lady at the bakery if they still carried a  chocolate oreo cake,she looked at me and said I'm not sure I would have to go and look.So she came back and said yes we still have it.So when we got seated and was ready to order I pointed at the cake in there menu and said that this is the one I'm gonna be getting,so he looks at me and tells me oh we don't carry that cake we haven't sold it since the store opened.i was like huh,but the lady said you do,so I eventually  ordered a slice of a different cake,so when i went to pay  for my bill I came across the lady who told me we had the cake I wanted the first time. I said excuse but didn't you say that you guys had that cake? Then I told her that  the waiter  said they never had it,n that they should be more knowledgeable of what their selling."}
{"text":"TODAY  I had breakfast here for the first time , Great food , amazing waitress , fast ,the only thing I can say that the coworkers were giving my waitress a hard time due that she was new , I sat at the bar  and I saw how they were treating her , it's sad to see how she was being bullied by their coworkers specially one old women with black hair , that was telling her boss that she need it to loss weight  while show in him her booty ,please haci o mas ofrecida. Not nice guys NOT NICE"}
{"text":"During a late night conversation with a friend living in Vegas, I suddenly craved belgian waffles + strawberries when this spot was suggested... I googled the menu out of curiosity, then disappointed my stomach immediately by learning that they have exactly what I want, and don't exist where I live (San Diego, CA).  Alas, a surprise trip to Vegas happened & here I was! Ordered the chicken waffle (\"Six ounces of tender, hand-breaded chicken breast sliced into four pieces and placed atop four wedges of our Belgian waffle\") to satisfy the salt and waffle craving, plus a fruit crepe on the side filled with strawberries... Let me just say this meal made me a happy lady! The crepe came out first, strawberry compote lined with whipped cream inside and out, about the size of a typical tortilla. Sweet, light and on the money; the chicken waffle came soon after. Chicken was tender, juicy, thin battered, fried crispy and served hot over a Belgian waffle so fresh you could smell it before the chicken. A dollop of whipped butter right in the center and... GO! It was so good I didn't even waste time taking pictures, which usually is a priority; ain't nobody got time for that today.   Service was fast and the waitress was sweet and thorough, even with the place packed... We were surprised how quickly everything came out of the kitchen. Hot tea and a to-go tray later, I'm smiling all the way out :) Seriously a great way to start a Sunday before football; I might make it a Vegas habit for me."}
{"text":"I come to eat here each time I'm visiting Vegas and I've never had a bad meal! I've tried everything from French toast, eggs, sandwiches and soups, everything is good!  My favorite is the French toast combo with eggs and potatoes, They're open 24 hours, give them a try!"}
{"text":"Not impressed. Ordered steak and eggs with hashbrowns and wanted biscuits and gravy but they won't substitute so I had to pay extra. Got my order and it was cold and wrong. Had to practical tackle a waitress to get more coffee or anything else we needed. Then they were rude. We were sitting in back near the waitress station and heard nothing but complaints and bickering. They didn't seem to get along with each other. I won't be back here. I suggest gong to the Black Bear Diner on West Tropicana. They are WAY WAY  WAY BETTER! !!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was okay I wasn't impressed. My girlfriend had a salad and a she got was a lousy iceberg salad. The service was slow , I doubt I'll go back ."}
{"text":"Food was delicious! ESPECIALLY the pancakes. The only thing preventing a 5 star rating is the dirty bathroom, which is something that happens when you stay open all the time. But it wasn't a big deal.  The waitress/hostess was very nice and gave us a free slice of cake. She also helped us tweak our orders to get the most amount for the least price while still getting exactly what we wanted. Very excellent for late night or early morning food. Apparently they are also big into coffee. I saw they had won an award for being a good coffee shop. Anyway, good place; I recommend it."}
{"text":"blueberry hill family restaurant truly lives up to its name. it features a welcoming, family like environment, with friendly staff, prompt service, and good food.  chicken quesadilla 9/10 the only reason I'm giving it a 9 is because I thought it could have used a little more cheese, but other than that it was extremely good, and the chicken was well cooked and seasoned   biscuits 10/10 extremely buttery and flavorful, quite honestly some of the best biscuits I've ever had  service 10/10 our waitress, Claudia was very polite and prompt, she made sure that we were taken care of in a timely manner and that all of our food was cooked to order. she really helped us feel welcome in the restaurant.   overall, I would say this was an excellent experience and I would definitely return if I was in the area in the future"}
{"text":"This review is for the Blueberry Hill Restaurant located next to the library on Flamingo. A group of seven of us had just got done bowling at Sam's Town and were looking to get our \"after drinking grub\" on. It was around 1am when we sat and began our wait....and I mean WAIT!!! We starting timing the waitress on our phones to see how long it was going to take her to get our order...10 minutes and a solid minute before we were going to leave. After that we waited another 10 minutes to actually get the drinks we ordered, well some of us that is. Me and two other friends ordered coffee and after waiting twenty minutes to see her start to walk over with it we all realized there was not enough in the pot for all of us. So my friend waited another 10 minutes before he actually got his coffee. My friend and I that did get coffee originally were already done with our coffee when he finally got some....uuggghhh!! Our friends that ordered soda both complained that something didn't taste right and switched too water. AND that was just the drinks:(   Now the food is the only part of this review that i gave stars to. Not for it's promptness or fantastical value because it had neither but for the fact that it was hot and filled up my alcohol laden belly as wished. It was good....when we finally got it:(   To set things into perspective...when we got there another large group of six sat down at the same time as us. When we were sitting there wondering if we would ever get our food or coffee for the lone one of  us that still hadn't gotten any they were gone and fed!!!! What a crappy experience at a normally very good place...disappointed that i brought my friends there for their first time and our waitress sucked!!! Must have had something to do with the 18% tip she tacked on our bill:{"}
{"text":"first time at this place, we showed up with about 18 people and were seated immediately. the server, (cant remember her name, something like Miranda?) was top notch... she got all of our orders correct the first time with no problems.. took care of all of us by herself.  the food was delicious and overly large portions.."}
{"text":"Fast service! Great food! And LARGE portions! I carved through my delicious corned beef hash omelette and finished about two thirds of my three pancakes that came with the omelette as a side. This is a great place to eat if you are visiting from out of town and need a quick, but big breakfast before you get on with your Las Vegas adventures.   PS: Come here HUNGRY!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent really good for breakfast but service I think is tip specific  I went in by myself and the waitress didn't want waste too much time with me assuming I wouldn't tip well. Thing is I tip well for good service and she got what she expected a basic 15% tip I will come back when I craving pancakes but now know what to expect when it come to the services"}
{"text":"This place definitely has a small town mom and pop diner feel to it complete with nonchalant staff. After we were seated and served our food our waiteress was not really around much.   The menu has lots of options at very good prices. The portions here are great. I ordered a Denver omlet with breakfast potates. Our food arrived hot and just as we ordered. My omlet was great but, the potatos were sort of greasy.  Overall, not the best and not the worst."}
{"text":"What an awesome breakfast place, just what I needed after a long night of Vegas. Our server was hilarious. Made us special drinks from the soda fountain."}
{"text":"I cannot understand the positive reviews, this place is a total dump.  Dirty, dirty dirty and marginal food at best.  Skip it, not worth the time it takes to get there."}
{"text":"Allright - I'll admit, this isn't the type of restaurant I am known to frequent.  However, unbeknownst  to those who may know me, Blueberry Hill has been a guilty-pleasure of mine for the past two decades.  For consistency, quality, cleanliness, selection and outstanding value, Blueberry Hill cannot be beat. I relish my Sunday mornings there for my little breakfast retreat. Anyway, my 'go-to' breakfast is the 'Little Boy Blue', a combination of homemade blueberry pancakes w/in-house made compote, 2 eggs, and your choice of meat, all for about $6.  Blueberry hill makes their batters fresh, their fruit compotes and pastries are also made in-house.  The atmosphere is family-oriented, clean, and truly 100% All-American Diner. Although I predominantly frequent the Decatur/Charleston location (ask for Megan), I have been a regular for years at both the GV & E. Flamingo locations as well for the past 20 years.  Take your family, take your friends - if your cholesterol isn't too high, treat yourself to an amazing chicken fried steak, arguably one of the best in the southwest!"}
{"text":"I chose a French Toast and a Corner beef hash omelette. The food was incredible tasty and well prepared. Generous portions. The menu  is vast and with lot of opitons to chose from.  Our server was knowledgeable, professional and really personable.  The place was not overcrowded but it took them 10 minutes to complete my order. As a customer in a hurry I expected just a little bit fatser service. This was my first visit here and in addition to the quality and quantity of the food,  I can add great prices. Not low proces but just fair.  Actually, I tried to jot down a review durring my stay in Blueberry Hill but something whent wrong with the wi-fi connection. Well, it is more comfy and cozy to write down from a keyboard than a touchscreen. So I compleated the review after when I whent back home.  Pretty satisfying experience with Bluberry."}
{"text":"Pancakes are not great I've had better. They cover your pancakes with pie filling if you ask for it or not, you have no option unless you get the plain pancakes. Coffee is terrible too, tastes like dirt!"}
{"text":"This place is total crap....the food is ridiculously overpriced & VERY sub-par to put it mildly...all the servers can't speak English & it's filthy....i remember when I came here 1 time I ordered coffee & the coffee mug was dirty.. (lipstick stains all around the brim) yuck...they don't clean their utensils..i picked up my fork it had food stuck to it...totally gross & when you complain they act like they can't understand you because they can't or simply won't speak English...i won't go back..."}
{"text":"After many rave reviews from family & friends who said the food was great and portions were big, my husband & I visited at about 10 am on Sunday morning a couple of weeks ago. I noticed when we walked in that there was NO atmosphere at all! The place is very beige: beige tile going a third of the way up the walls, beige linoleum, etc.It reminded me a lot of a budget motel dining or banquet room. Very generic and boring. I was expecting a few pictures on the walls of blueberries or some country type pictures with a name like Blueberry Hill Family Restaurant but there were no pictures at all. It was pretty busy. The place was about 85% full. After a couple of minutes, our server came over. Didn't catch her name but she was friendly, upbeat and had a smile on her face. After looking over the big menu, I had decided on two eggs sunny side up, hash browns, and a short stack of pancakes. Hubby wanted pancakes too so after learning the short stack is three pancakes, we decided we'd split a stack: two for him and one for me. Hubby also ordered a Denver omelet which came with either hash browns or chunky potatoes (his choice: chunky), and choice of toast (his choice: whole wheat). We both just wanted water to drink.  After a reasonable amount of time our order came. My hash browns, what little there were of them, were SMEARED onto my plate! Not an appetizing display & it was the tiniest amount of hash browns I'd ever been served in a restaurant!  On a brighter note, my sunny side up eggs looked beautiful. The pancakes came with hot maple syrup on the side. After tasting everything, there was some good news but mostly bad news: the hash browns, not surprisingly from the way they looked, tasted terrible! Greasy and the grease tasted OLD! YUCK!! The eggs were cooked perfectly although they had no seasoning on them at all which I easily rectified with the shakers on the table. The pancakes were overcooked. When I cut into them, the top layer separated from the rest and they were chewy. If they'd just been cooked a minute or two less...  Hubby said his omelet was good and it was a decent size. I tried his chunky potatoes which were good, not great, but markedly better than my hash browns. The portion size of his potatoes was small too. His toast was fine.   Our server never came by after we had tried our food to ask how things were.  We had to flag her down to get the check.  We were disappointed in our experience at Blueberry Hill, especially after hearing such great things about it! We might go back one more time to try it again. Maybe they were just having a bad day? If we do, I'll post another review then."}
{"text":"As expect from the famous name, the food was delicious. However, for some reason the worker are slower at midnight. After prom me and some friends (10 total) sat down, the served us water and got our order right away. But after they brought the food, they rarely came to check up on us. I got the bonanza special that came with pancakes and I had to go up to the counter to get a bottle of syrup. Kinda mad me mad. Then we asked for refills, she kept repeating, \"I'll be right with you in a second\" for a good 25 mins. The place was not even full. But other than that, the food was very good. Maybe the workers are just tired."}
{"text":"Watched a lady have a heart attack and fall to the ground and then emergency personnel arrive and wheel her out as we waited for our food.  The chicken-fried chicken was good, would come again."}
{"text":"Great if you dont care about your figure Irish eggs Benedict awesome. Mom going with with grilled cheese and tomato boring."}
{"text":"So I'm letting you in on a secret..  It's a place that just has the yummiest food..  They have the best biscuits n gravy I have ever had!!  Hands down!!  You have to try them!!  Delish!!!  When you're in Vegas the next time and you're looking for great grub, look no further than Blueberry Hill..  This place is really good!!  And it's open 24 hrs for your food pleasure..  Lol. I would give it five stars if it were in a nicer area and had a better inside decor. But, it's so worth it!!  Give it a try when your in Vegas the next time.  Also, try their corned beef hash!!  It's really tasty!!  You've been enlightened Yelpers!!  Don't miss out on this hidden gem, it's simply DELICIOUS!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Found this place on accident , drove by saw all the cars decided to give it a try the menu is huge many items to pick from. I ordered Tennessee steak with 2 eggs , hash browns and sourdough toast. Steak was awesome , sourdough bread with the eggs perfect. A great place if your tired of eating on the strip"}
{"text":"Just landed me and my family wanted breakfast food so after 5 hour flight from md we looked blueberry hill and we enjoyed a lot of food and food people we will surely be back thanks again"}
{"text":"Service was quick and friendly. Food was perfect. The fresh fruit crepes are amazing. Have to come back again and again.  Maybe week try something else?"}
{"text":"A very good family diner... Those who are looking for a homey vibes . Try this place I felt I was in my grandmas kitchen.... Good food"}
{"text":"I hate to do this because this place was my favorite. My friend and I who hasn't gone there in a few months decided to go since we wanted some good French toast. We get there, seat ourselves (per usual) this guy comes to our table, can't speak a word of English and is trying to take our drink order. He repeats it wrong like twice and we just looked at each other. He says to \"hold on\" then a girl comes, she can speak English but not very well. She was really nice and tried her best. I got water and my friend got an iced coffee. She brings the drinks and my friends coffee has a giant spoon in it. It's coffee, not a milk shake. I order my food. I get the French toast special and order my eggs \"basted\". She comes out with my food and my eggs are so runny and undercooked it was disgusting. I showed the server and she says \"okay let me have them make you new ones\" she comes out later, puts the new plate of eggs on the table and I kid you not, the eggs were so over cooked it looked like a hard boiled egg. Like was that supposed to be a \"screw you\" from the chef?! I was so tired of complaining I just didn't even say anything and took them like that. I won't go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"On my way home from work one day, I saw this restaurant on the way and the parking lot seemed to be pretty packed and I decided to go inside. When the food came out, after waiting for the waiter for 15 minutes. The overall size and price was good but the taste seemed below par. If you want a breakfast place I would recommend IHOP over this place anytime."}
{"text":"Good food alot of food so much you might have to ask for a to go box cheap nice place feels like home"}
{"text":"Outstanding breakfast, outstanding customer service and outstanding facility, 4 stars instead of 5 because there were flies where we were eating ."}
{"text":"Great service great food...only bad thing is the sausage....didn't really like it but hey I'm a farmer John sausage man anyway lol"}
{"text":"One word, Roaches! I saw 2!  Living in Vegas we have all seen our share of roaches here and there. However, because roaches are nocturnal, to see one in the walkway between my table and the bathroom (baby roach), and then one in the walkway by the back door by our table is way too much! It was just after all 11 am. Isn't that a sign of an infestation? I tried to get somebody's attention but the staff was too busy to stop! We just left. I was extra observant as we left and noticed that the areas under the cooking surfaces were disgusting! This place needs a health inspector and a terminator. I have never said I would not return to a place until today!     Oh- before the \"roach sightings\" I asked our waitress for a fork. She gave me one. It was dirty!  My husband finally gave me his to use...   I never would have written a review about an overworked staff,  that's a management fail. But I had to post about the roach issue!  The food was good, but I cant help but wonder how much of the flavor was added by roach droppings!  I should start using the bathroom BEFORE I consume a restaurants food! Ha ha ha  I'll pass on this place from now on!"}
{"text":"Another great visit, as usual! Took my family that was visiting from out of town & they couldn't say enough wonderful things about it.  They have a few new items since my last time there; Chocolate Oreo pancakes, Bailey's Irish cream French toast, & strawberry/cheese stuffed French toast.  Normally I love ordering the cinnamon swirl pancakes, but for some reason I wanted eggs benedict. So, I decided on the chorizo benedict. Not a very wise choice :( It was tasty, but tasted more like chili & not the chorizo I'm used to eating. Of course I'm used to eating homemade. So needless to say, Blueberry Hills chorizo...not so Mexcellent.  I think I will just go with my gut next time & go with the best pancakes in Vegas ;)"}
{"text":"The crepe dealer is my absolute favorite! Been coming here for years it always hits the spot."}
{"text":"It amazes me how much the quality of this restaurant have changed since the last time I ate here. I remembered the 4am breakfast so awesome that I had to come back the next weekend. But this last weekend was so disappointing!  First of all! I hate big menus. I sat there longer than I wanted because of all the damn pages I had to go through. It was like reading a novel. I was so confused on what I should get.  I ordered the egg benedict. The hollandaise sauce was horrible!!! It tasted like some type of gravy that was made out of pre mixed powder and felt like it was suppose to be used on chicken fried stake instead! It was grainy, too thick, and bland. Hash brown was soggy and chewy. The only thing I liked was the whipped butter that was served with my toast, and that's sad when a condiment is better than rest of the dish.  My boyfriend ordered the classic omelet, and you can tell they use sliced fake cheese because it sticks to the roof of your mouth to the point where I had to use a fork to get it out. Eww! I really hate restauranant cuts corners and uses fake and preserves to cut on their costs.  Maybe I'm just really jaded when it comes to breakfast, but I'd rather pay a bit more for a good plate of food with amazing favors than okay price for plain food. Blueberry Hill just did not deliver for me and I probably will not return to this or any Blueberry Hill."}
{"text":"This was our first time eating at this restaurant, we heard it was pretty good and open 24hrs. We came in around midnight and were sat immediately & our orders were taken promptly. Our waitress initially was attentive but became very rude after a member of my party's food wasn't what she thought it would be and mine was under cooked. I asked if I could substitute the undercooked side and the waitress said \" I really don't know what you're saying to me\" and walked away from our table.   She returned a few minutes later and said \"so what are you trying to tell me\" I explained that the food was visibly uncooked & she said \"ok what is it you want me to do\" after I had clearly asked to substitute, she angrily snatched the plate and said she'd take it off of my ticket which clearly didn't help being that I came to a restaurant to eat food...   It was a bad overall experience. The food was not good and the waitress was EXTREMELY rude."}
{"text":"Cheap and acceptable food. Good for breakfast and very good service. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great place for a traditional breakfast. Large portions are served and they keep your coffee filled!"}
{"text":"Blueberry Hill is a long-term Vegas staple, and has lasted this long because the food is always a true treat! I warn the \"Sweet Tooth  Masters\" , and so-called \"Choco-holics\" You will meet your match/demise with the Chocolate Pancakes. It doesn't have chocolate chips, or a chocolate syrup. No no no, there is a hivh concentration of chocolate IN THE BATTER! So much so, that even a bona fide  chocolate master like myself was only able to put 1 &  1/2 pancakes away before giving in to the oncoming mack truck called \"instant diabetes\""}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, about a 20 minute wait in a Sunday morning, not too bad. Ran out of drink a few times but other than that is was a pretty good experience."}
{"text":"For years this has been a MUST stop when family visits - usually the last stop before heading to the airport. On a recent visit we were completely grossed out! Eleven o'clock in the morning and my daughter feels something crawling on her foot; it is a cockroach! We didn't mention it to the staff but when one crawled up the wall next to me, I couldn't handle it. Got up (rather hurriedly) and went to the hostess to tell her. She walks back to the booth - to see WHAT?! The roaches didn't wait for her. Her comment was that pest control had been the during the night and the roaches all come out after that. There was no apology, no let me comp your meal, NOTHING other than a disdainful look at me! Goodbye cinnamon pancakes, goodbye world's best French toast - we won't be returning."}
{"text":"Food was tasty and the service was good. Portions were a good size. Would recommend and revisit!"}
{"text":"Overheard someone talking on her cell to a friend (well, okay, I was eavesdropping) and she was giving rave reviews about Blueberry Hill.  Since we were visiting LV and headed for dinner, decided to give it a try.  We were glad we did.  It was Sunday night so the place was quiet.  We got seated right away and had wonderful service from Margarita.  The portions were awesome and very tasty.    We plan to go back at least once, maybe twice, before we leave town."}
{"text":"The only downside to this place is they're not open 24 hours :( I love this place, I come here every chance I get.  I usually order the Waitress Special; their waffles are phenomenal, YES even better than IHOP, I'm sorry to say to all IHOP fans.  Their waffles are crisp on the outside and so fluffy on the inside as it should be with waffles, it's almost like you're eating a lightly fried cloud smothered in sweet and delicious syrup.  And with a little help from Nestle Creamers, their coffee is Yum Yum, you can't have just one cup of coffee here; you say you're only going to have just one cup, but it's just so good, you have to have refill and why not???  Love this place. The servers are very friendly and talks to you like they've known you for years.  You go in hungry and take off feeling full and part of the family. :)"}
{"text":"I have been to BBH on S. Decatur many times for lunch.  I have always enjoyed the food and never have had a complaint.  Today I happened to look at the ceiling and was totally disgusted.  There was a dead spider hanging from an air vent that kept swaying with the air of the ceiling fan.  The ceiling air vents are full of dust.  The ceiling tiles have evidence of past water or liquid leakage damage and they are also infiltrated with dust and dirt.    I shouldn't have looked up. After I saw the spider hanging, my appetite went away.  I felt this filthy restaurant belongs to a third world country."}
{"text":"Great breakfast food, fast and friendly service. Hot chocolate comes with chocolate chip cookie!!"}
{"text":"We visited the location on West Flamingo, not once but twice during our visit to Vegas.  We had dinner and was so happy with the meal, service, etc that we ventured back the next day for Thanksgiving lunch.  The traditional turkey meal was fantastic. It is worth the bus ride and walk to get there. Liked the place so much, I purchased a coffee mug! We will definately go again when I town."}
{"text":"Food was good. When IM in town I always come with my family. Great service and feels like home. Clean to. Make Me feel like IM home."}
{"text":"I had such wonderful service this morning the waitress was friendly  and warm and her customer service skills were impeccable 4 years ago my husband and I first date was at this Blueberry Hill and it was as wonderful then as it is now"}
{"text":"Definitely a place to go for breakfast!! They are just like  I hop if not better. They have lots of food to choose from and the service is friendly and on point. They are never too busy. I love eating here"}
{"text":"Has gone down hill. Use to be our go to restaurant for breakfast every time we're in LV. Not any more. Between soggy waffles, burnt hash browns and scrambled POWDERED eggs, we will not be back. One of our group was severely allergic to powdered eggs and 6 hours later is stll paying the price for their deception. Too bad because the waitresses are top notch."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I arrived at Blueberry Hill around 9:30 p.m. on August 7. We were extremely dissatisfied by the service for the last time and decided we'd write a review. Our server Josh was not helpful at all, He barely spoke the entire time. No communication what so ever. He screwed up our orders and did not come to check up on us the entire time. This has happened every time we've been there. Probably won't be returning."}
{"text":"After many rave reviews from friends, I took my grandmother to check it out. She got a piece of pumpkin pie, we both got coffee and I ordered the Irish eggs Benedict. Coffee is coffee, the pie was satisfactory and appeared to be store bought but my Benedict was horrendous! First, the eggs were almost hard boiled, then it is canned corned beef hash and hollandaise sauce but the kicker was the chicken or turkey bones inside my potatoes. No where did I order poultry.   Do yourself a favor and go to iHop or Denny's if you want the average breakfast meals. If you want something really good, go to the Omelet House! Their food is actually made in house and to order.   I will never go back and you shouldn't either, unless you want to send your food back and go hungry."}
{"text":"My favorite place for breakfast. Used to go to the green valley location but they closed it and I was so sad. Later saw they had another location and I've been here 2 times. It's been great. The food is delicious. Huge portions. My only complaint is it takes a while to get the food but the food is totally worth the wait. I always leave here over stuffed because I don't want to stop eating. Love it!"}
{"text":"On a Sunday morning, this place is warm and inviting, even with the video poker and slots at the entrance. But this is Vegas, after all.  The coffee was a mild brew, easy on an empty stomach while reading over the hundred or so number of breakfasts. I asked Suzie, a sweetheart of a waitress, what she recommended for a First-Timer. She swore by the pancakes. Still, I went with a basic spinach and swiss omelet, complementing this with a side of pancakes.  When the food came, I thought the table would tip over from the size of the portions. The omelet practically hung over the edges of the plate, and the \"side\" of pancakes towered like a mountain as whipped butter melted along the surface and down the sides. But every bite revealed a refreshingly airy quality to the food. I was so intimidated at first, but in fact the eggs and batter were whipped up just right so I didn't have to be rolled out to my car.  Oh, and for you and your fogies, there's a discount for peoples 55 and over. Remember that this Sunday when you want to say \"Hey, Dad. You know what? Let's get some pancakes.\""}
{"text":"BEST FRENCH TOAST EVER!  I've done a lot of traveling,  eaten at a lot of restaurants,  this is by far the best french toast ever!"}
{"text":"Crispy Bacon, the biscuits and gravy are delicious! Fresh and always on point , very prompt fast service plus they let you choose where to sit when not so busy."}
{"text":"We'd had wonderful food and superior service at the Blueberry Hill on Flamingo, so since this was closer to our house, we thought we'd give it a shot.  After being pleasantly seated, we sat and memorized the menu and specials forever.  Even considered walking out.  We wish we had.  Our waiter could not multi-task nor remember a request for longer than six steps.  I asked for lemon for my iced tea three times, and finally got a saucer with three slivers of lemon.  Refills were the same problem.  The lettuce in my salad was (I hope) frozen and thawed as I picked out limp bits and gave up.  The Ranch dressing was watery.  Green beans were undercooked and (horrors) the cook thought that adding red pepper might improve them.  Not.  The last straw was dessert.  After ordering coconut cream pie, it was delivered, eventually, to the table in a styrofoam container.  (I didn't ask for it to go).  After moving it to a leftover saucer and taking two bites that were iffy, I noticed what looked like smears of blood on the side.  Gag.  I got up and took it to the counter looking for a manager.  There I was told it was leftover strawberry filling from the cake.  I refused a second piece.  The waiter showed up, apparently annoyed, to ask about the pie and explain that he'd used a knife that was previously used for the cake.  After I remarked that that \"was clean\"? he offered to cut another with a clean knife.  Was this something I should have requested beforehand?  \"I'd  like a piece of pie cut with a clean knife served on a dessert plate.\"  Uh, no.  We won't go back."}
{"text":"Best breakfast ever! Chocolate chip pancakes are the best I've ever had, and I've had many! Always a stop when we go to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Fueled up here before heading off to a week of camping in Utah. This place is everything you fantasize about when it comes to delicious, greasy, hugely satisfying breakfasts. The portions were huge, the service friendly.  I'd be fine if I never came to Vegas again, but Blueberry Hill will be top of my list if I ever do."}
{"text":"Being from the East coast, this place instantly caught our eye. The big blue neon sign is extremely hard to ignore and after driving past a couple more times, we gave in.    Tips of the trade when you visit Blueberry Hill:  -ask for real creamer !! They have it, but shhh~ it's a secret, they keep it in the back - you don't have to worry about coming in here and cursing under your breath about there not being a booth open, BECAUSE ALL SEATS ARE BOOTHS ! **BLESS**  -the food is typical dinner food. You want something fried ? They got you boo~ Want something huge ? Even better ! Need something solid to cure that hangover ? No problem.   On the day we went back and managed to finish all of our food we decided to try our luck at ordering some dessert. The size is huge, but the weight is light. It doesn't weigh you down or put you in a food comma. We cant say for sure but- the quality of the meat is really good- they seem to use healthier options in their cooking.  Great place 24/7. Friendly, talkative servers !!!! Always clean and quiet! The atmosphere is 100% and is the main reason why we love it here so much, we could sit in here with just our coffee for hours. Perfect spot to hang out and kill time while you munch on your chicken and waffles at 3am~"}
{"text":"Our waiter was a jerk until near the end. He wanted to get our drinks all at once but people arrived about three mins from each other. It's 109 degrees in Vegas, we want water. He gave us attitude and was uncooperative almost the entire brunch.   Food was good and large servings."}
{"text":"The best breakfast I've ever had (banana walnut pancakes and chilaqules). Didn't expect to see mexican food on the menu, but they did it better than any mexican restaurant I've ever been to."}
{"text":"Service was okay, food was sparse. The grilled cheese sandwich I ordered ($9.50) had what looked to be a single slice of cheese. Unlikely to ever try them again."}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place! We went there several times during our stay in Las Vegas and it was great every time. The server was really nice and attentive and the food is awesome. Try the Blueberry Pancakes!! We can definitely recommend this diner."}
{"text":"All their breakfast is good so far.  I'm here for a 2-week conference and I've been here the past 5 days in a row.  French toast = outstanding.  Scrambled eggs = real eggs, and they're BIG.  Cinnamon swirl Pancakes = effing AMAZING!  Meat & Egg skillet = delicious and big enough for two!  Every time I eat there,they give me so much food that I literally almost throw up because I can't stop eating.  Their blueberry muffins are also fresh, warm, and to die for.  I heard this place was going out of business because the property owner is a dick and won't renew their lease. It's going to be a Vietnamese restaurant pretty soon (they can afford to spend more on rent because they don't pay their workers jack), so you better try it while it's still there!  Yes, the parking sucks, but the food is well worth it.  The service is pretty good, too.  The waitresses are nice, even when you're a dick (the guy next to me was complaining about the wording on the menu this morning and was rude to the waitress.  He was just an idiot, but the waitress was very nice to him.  I, however, was not as generous.)"}
{"text":"I love coming to this place!! Has the Mom & Pop type feeling that I love, especially when it comes to breakfast places. Their menu has a wide wide variety of dishes and you'll definitely find something to either satisfy a craving or want to try something new. And living close by is an extra plus!!!  It's one of the better breakfast places in all of Las Vegas in my opinion! It is a must try!"}
{"text":"Definitely a good breakfast spot. Service was on par and prompt. Nicole (our server) recommended the pancakes. It was a power breakfast. Good cure for my hangover. Coffee was good. Not Starbucks though. I thought the decor was a little dated. But it was clean though. I'd try them again."}
{"text":"There's few things that I love about food more than a breakfast done right...! With an excellent staff that gets you in a great mood and food that leaves your tastes buds more than satisfied,  you can't go wrong with Blueberry Hill! This is my second time here and still haven't been disappointed, if anything my visit this time was better than the last. Today we tried the \"Chicken and Waffles\" and \"Chocolate OREO Pancakes\"! Both of which were nothing short of delicious. Each has their own unique taste that keeps you wanting \"one more bite\" as long as you find yourself able to stomach the great portions that they give you, it shouldn't be a problem at all. If you like chocolate and you like pancakes for breakfast the chocolate OREO pancakes are definitely the way to go! The OREO cookies and bits are cooked right into the pancake and topped off with a sauce that is what I beleive to be OREO cream itself! (if I am wrong please don't tell me) and last but not least the chicken and waffles! This dish blended the sweetness of a dessert and hardiness of a breakfast meal. It caught me off guard with flavors that you would think to be very conflicting ones, turning it Into an epic combination of fulfillment and delight! I'd love to go on even more but that's all for today, I will definitely be back to try more of the food they have to offer! It is well worth the visit!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This one is right near Nellis AFB. Easy to get to if south on Las Vegas Blvd. Been there twice and the breakfast is phenomenal!!! Good coffee and fast (a plus in the a.m.) The pancakes are HUGE...waitress actually gavemy 6 yrs old my pancakes and gave me his. Seems the cook made them as big as the plate... HUGE omelletes, I could not even finish mine. Cheap prices and very friendly staff. Nice older ladies give it the real old school coffe shoppe feel. Lounge are attached with some video casino fare. Clean establishment, I was stuffed after :-9  If up this way, better than IHOP/Denny's/etc and helluva lot cheaper...AND 24Hrs!!!"}
{"text":"We've been going to las Vegas for about 30 years and we always like to leave the hotel and go have breakfast. This place has super size portions and the price is reasonable. Friendly staff. Breakfast here is always great. Pancakes are super."}
{"text":"Pancakes were huge and delicious. Waitress Alison was terrific."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and the food is always good, the servers are very tentative and you can get some good deals! plus they always have a table ready for their costumers as soon as you come in. I've never had to wait a long time to be seated :)"}
{"text":"Every time we are in Vegas we eat breakfast here before we leave to go home. Portions are generous. Service is great. Food is delicious."}
{"text":"This place used to be great...awesome food and attentive servers. I don't know if they're under new management or what, but this place has really gone down-blueberry-hill. Today half our food was served cold. Server Ashley left a lot to be desired during her chit-chat with coworkers such as water refills, napkins, and silverware. Luckily we were sat in the back next to a buss station and could get these items ourselves. Won't be coming back here anytime soon!"}
{"text":"Yummy Food!  Hamburger's and fries are sooo good! Cravable! Very fresh food.  The breakfast is great too!  Good place to go late night to kick back unwind and eat. Service has always been  friendly and fast. We eat there very often when we go to Vegas My kids love it too."}
{"text":"If you ever get tired of the whole \"$ 'insert number of our choice.99 steak and egg\" thing like I do, then head on over to Blueberry Hill right off the strip for some real good late night grub, breakfast, dinner...whatevers.  It's just a simple diner that gots good food at a decent price.  Food: Blueberry pancakes (made from scratch, ask for the blueberry sauce on the side unless you LOVE blueberries..keep it mind they also put blueberries in the pancakes too) and Chicken Fried Steak (Nice, thick, crispy and lots of gravy!)  *While you wait try your luck on the slots and if you win....good for you! =)"}
{"text":"Arrived at 1200 am. Not too crowded. Self seating. Took 15 minutes to take our order and waiter forgot to bring drinks. The food took about 35 minutes to from time of ordering till it came to table. The food itself was average. I would not come back based on the wait times. The waiter was polite through the entire service though."}
{"text":"It's not Dennys so it automatically gets one star. There were no specials posted so I figured waffle combo and orange juice would be safe. The eggs were runny instead of scrambled, the sausage had a really weird texture and there was way too much butter on my waffle. The orange juice was average.   They don't have Wi-Fi which kind of sucks.   Got the bill the food was magically $2 more than the menu price. I should have got a mcmuffin and saved my $15."}
{"text":"Definitely an oasis in the desert. Their menu is incredibly extensive with two to three pages of just breakfast alone. Their daily specials are plentiful and delicious looking. Ate here about five years ago and then again this trip. Still as tasty as I remembered. My wife had the Parmesan crusted chicken, I had the meatloaf sandwich, and our friend had the Mexican combination plate. All looked and tasted fantastic. We had a slice of fresh strawberry cake and it was meh. Not bad but just blah. Pretty much the only thing that kept me from reviewing this five stars."}
{"text":"This was like the worse restaurant I've been to. The menu looked great BUT the hostess was rude. It took our waiter forever to come to the table and when she did she was horrible! Her clothes were dirty! I've worked in a restaurant and I know how it is but her shirt should not have been that filthy! THENNN SOME GUY WALKED PASSED WATERS AND WALKED BACK AND ASKED IF WE WANTED THEM. The cups looked dirty. When we got to our table the floor had all kind of trash on it! The black was so dim it seemed depressing ! I wish I could write a review without a star! We didn't even eat the service was horrible we just left."}
{"text":"Not impressed.  I really craved/wanted hash browns, but didn't want eggs.  After the waitress confused me with suggestions of specials and what can/can't be substituted I thought I was good to go.  After way to large a portion of (good) bluebery pancakes, sausage, and biscuits, there was still no hash browns.  Turns out she goofed.  And her mistake cost me $13!!! Sorry, but $13 for no eggs or hash browns + sloppy service makes me want to do the casino buffets.  I explained to the cashier how unhappy I was and she could not have been any more uninterested."}
{"text":"Enormous breakfast menu and portions! Lunch and dinner menu is great too. Arlene waited on our table. Location on Flamingo Blvd is roomier."}
{"text":"Hands down the best breakfast place in town! The cinnamon pancakes along with the service was amazing. When I come to town, this is the only place I will be going for breakfast from now on!!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for breakfast and lunch once more. They hired a new manager he really cracked the whip and straighten this place out, the food again is very good served hot and quick.  Try their biscuits and gravy. The Tennessee steak and eggs also one of my favs."}
{"text":"Great food and service !! I love the music that they play in the restaurant. This is a really great place to spend 50 dollars worth of food."}
{"text":"Im a breakfast type of guy and this place hit the spot. Service was great and the food was even better. The pancakes are big n fluffy so don't order too much unless you can handle it. I got the omelette which was delish and the OJ seemed to be freshly squeezed."}
{"text":"Drive by this place many times and looks like a family friendly restaurant so we decided to give it a try. Came here for dinner and they were not even busy, the place was pretty dead. We ordered the liver and onion, lentil soup, and a few more items and everything came out room temperature. Every dish lacked flavor except the lentil soup. The ambiance of the place was very sad and depressing, maybe because there's hardly any patrons dining there?"}
{"text":"So much yummy.  I took my kids there for a hearty meal and we weren't disappointed.  We ordered chocolate chip pancakes, pigs in blankets, and scrambled eggs.  Everything was absolutely delicious and we even took some home for a late-night snack.  I can't wait to go back and try the rest of their menu."}
{"text":"I come here all the time for breakfast and sometimes dinner. The food is fabulous. I have never been disappointed. The staff will always make you feel welcome. Great place to start your day."}
{"text":"Came in here randomly. Was shocked by how huge the menu is! If your looking for breakfast, you will find something you like here.   Service is friendly, food is good! Tons of food at a very reasonable price!  Worth checking out!!"}
{"text":"I have been here to eat 3 times. The first 2 times were great n thats why there was a 3rd time. But the third time was just awful. First when our food arrived, it was cold. I don't mean meh kinda warm, it was cold. After sending eggs benedict and bisquits n gravy back to be \"nuked\" the waitress disappeared. By the time she did return I was to livid to say or do anything but pay n leave. I ordered my eggs poached or fried hard. My eggs were so runny .....even after it was reheated in microwave. As we were leaving to pay, waitress was nowhere to be seen. Then we notice heat lamp in food window not on n food just sitting. Now I know why my food was so cold. Sat in the window far to long! Be awhile before I return."}
{"text":"the food was great. very homemade.  horrible service.  waitress was rude from the beginning when she took our orders and asked if we wanted separate checks. we told her to put it one. when it was time to pay we asked if we could do separate payments. we misunderstood her. the manager asked her to separate them and she came over giving us an attitude saying she already asked us and said it would take time away from her other tables. we told the manager this was not great service and she didnt acknowledge what we said. not a good way to run a business and treat your customers !!!"}
{"text":"Great service and Big portions... The food is delicious and flavorful.. Highly recommend this diner and it's 24 hrs so you can't beat that... Dennys who??? Lol... Its a must to war here while in Las Vegas... My family loves Blueberry Hill..."}
{"text":"This place has great tasting food, portions are large especially the oreo pancakes. Will def eat here again....."}
{"text":"We found this little gem after fleeing the Strip in search of cheaper, less crowded, Yum-Ness...  The chicken fried chicken was sublime. SUBLIME. The pancakes were from a fluffy pancake heaven...the chiliquiles was ubber tasty (minus the meh rice)... (please don't ask me about the odd grossness of the \"Asian\" chicken salad my one crazy child ordered on a whim...cooked mushrooms & wilted lettuce floating in dressing... Ew.)  Breakfast seems the way to go here.  The service was awesome and friendly!  Would most def go here again for scrumptious breakfast eats!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good except that the prices don't really match the portions to me. Expected a little more out of $9 worth of 4 french toasts."}
{"text":"I love this place. Pancakes and french toast are awesome and the sandwiches are great. Portions across the board are large and good to share. To make it even better, the staff are friendly and eager to discuss specials and whatever comes to mind. A great place for a late meal or an early breakfast to kickoff the day!"}
{"text":"In my opinion, this is the best Blueberry Hill has to offer. The food and service are excellent, and the kitchen staff are professionals. Compared to other restaurants, this place makes me want to eat here three times a day. And, it has been this way for 20 years.   Thank you!"}
{"text":"I have to give this place a one star due to service. I was there yesterday and man; the ancient woman they have serving has to go. I'm all about giving equal opportunity to people but when you can't remember someone's toast, give me burnt coffee, forget the half n half, messed my order up and got cold food.  The servers are just bitter people, when I asked another server for half n half since the woman couldn't remember the first thing I asked after I got coffee, and she just seemed annoyed with the question. I won't come here anymore or tell anyone to come here.  Gave them a chance to redeem themselves after the first time I got horrible service.  Don't waste your money, it's expensive with horrible service and mediocre food. My eggs were cold as soon as I got them."}
{"text":"Ended up going to this spot around 9pm so it was pretty slow. Ordered the Bonanza and I was very disappointed because the ham was extremely dry. I couldn't finish the whole  piece. As I was at the register the cashier was gossiping about someone, as I stood there waiting and waiting as she talked to 2 other workers. They made racial comments and I was very turned off! I'm not sure if I would eat here again. Bad customer service and the food wasn't up to par."}
{"text":"Was looking for fluffy pancakes and this definitely was the place. We got the corn beef omeletcake which is an omelet inside of a giant pancake (the 1 pancake = 3 regular pancakes) and we also got the corn beef hash plate which comes with muffin/toast and two pancakes with it. All of it was great, the pancakes were amazing (probably best I've had), corn beef hash great and omeletcake huge but amazingly good that my brother had to eat the entire thing (which is pretty hard to do since it's at least a pound of food). I would highly suggest this place especially if you love fluffy pancakes like me :]"}
{"text":"This place is GREAT.  This is the way ot was back in the day.  FABULOUS!!!  Service, price and food.  Triple Threat.  We have dined many places in L.V. and this is by far our best.  The portions are oversize and great looking plates.  What a menu!!!  Clean, efficient and great food.  We will be back.  Thanks Blueberry for a great dining experience.  You nailed it!!!"}
{"text":"Quite possibly the BEST pancakes I've ever had.  Not a huge obscene size, but a normal looking pancake that knocks your socks off!  We had other food there, but nothing even close to the pancakes!  Go there, order pancakes and be amazed :)"}
{"text":"Pretty good breakfast  but awfully cramped!! If  you don't mind not being able to back up your chair without hitting someone else, by all means come here..."}
{"text":"Great place to go for breakfast if you are really hungry. Hubby and I just split an omelet and pancake meal and I'm still too full. Really good pancakes."}
{"text":"LOVED this little gem, not far off the strip.  The food and prices were great, and HUGE portions. Will be our go to for breakfast for future Vegas trips. The chicken and waffles were AMAZING"}
{"text":"For this place to be a individually owned family ran business and not a chain restaurant,  it was totally awesome on all aspects!!  From the waitstaff to the cook, we could not have asked for a better experience.   The waitress, Sedalia, had a great personality, got our orders correct, checked on us constantly,  making sure that our coffee was fresh and if we needed anything else.   Also, the food was done perfectly to our liking and requests.  We ordered breakfast, which was brought to us fresh and hot, to our specifications and not greasy at all! We HIGHLY RECOMMEND trying this place out.  You will get a nice meal, not way expensive and have a great experience, too!"}
{"text":"We went here for breakfast but the waiting area was so crowded we decided not to wait. As we were leaving, the manager ran out and caught us before we left and told us they were a large group waiting and that we could be seated right away. The food was terrific  and this manager is a great ambassador for this place!!"}
{"text":"The place kinda looks like an old dinner but it was clean. The food was good and the portions are large which is a plus, the waiter was nice but he kinda rush us to order but other than that everything was good."}
{"text":"The food and service were nice, but this place is a bit pricey. I spent about $6 on soda and a small batch of fries."}
{"text":"A great local breakfast hangout. Enjoyed a reasonably priced American style breakfast. Seating was fast, service was okay. Food was tasty."}
{"text":"Everyone once in a while I crave for a nice big breakfast and this place hit the spot. They have a large menu and much to choose from. The prices aren't to crazy and portion sizes are very large. I could clearly tell I wasn't going to finish my entire meal once it was brought out. They have some the best pancakes I've ever had. I ordered cinnamon swirl  pancakes and they tasted perfect topped with icing.  The service isn't the best I've had but the food definitely make ups for it.  They have some nice homemade pies that I'd like to try and I would defiantly head back to try other things on their menu.  Make sure to try any of their pancakes or omelets."}
{"text":"Another good, solid breakfast place. Menu is large so pretty much can find something."}
{"text":"Came to Blueberry Hill because I wanted to try liver and onions because I heard that for meat eaters that liver is a superfood. Was seated quickly and Taylor was an awesome server. She was very friendly and accommodating to my special requests. Awesome Taylor!"}
{"text":"We stopped for a quick bite before we left vegas so our daughter could get french toast before we got on the road.  Undercooked cold potatoes, poor grade ham for the Eggs Benedict. French Toast had too much egg.  Service was underwhelming. Had to ask for coffee and water. Only thing worth getting is coffee."}
{"text":"Blueberry hill is the greatest restaurant in Las Vegas the food is always good I have eaten there at least a hundred times and I have never once been disappointed in my breakfast or my lunch or my dinner. The one thing that maybe I complained about is my toast was cold and that has probably happened less than twice and it was never a big deal. The best Blueberry Hill is on Flamingo and Rochelle or maybe it's Flamingo and Tamaras. That's the best one the second to best one is on Flamingo and Decatur it's a newer building and then there's another one over there off of Decatur and Charleston. The one on Decatur and Charleston is a little bit not up to par with the customer service but it's still great food. My husband usually gets the Chile cheeseburger I usually get the pork chops and eggs and my daughter usually get pancakes eggs and bacon and everybody's always very happy"}
{"text":"The food was burn and taste it bad. Waitress forgot utensils and took awhile to bring food."}
{"text":"Fish & Chips barely edible. Ice coffee was full of ice cubes and maybe 4oz of coffee with no refills. Fries just warm and because they are so thin there seemed to be no taste. After 3 tries I think it's my last try for this restaurant."}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant with a group of friends.  We were seated pretty quickly. Unfortunately, they couldn't put any tables together for us (we were a pretty big group!), but they made sure to seat us at two different tables that were still close to each other.  Our server promptly took our orders and our food came out in a good amount of time. There was something wrong with one of our dishes, and the server was very apologetic. She took it to the kitchen, and brought it back out the way it was supposed to be in a timely manner!   They were able to split our check, which is always a plus. Prices were reasonable, server was friendly and attentive, and the food was great. I would definitely come back to this location!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast. Like a denny's on steroids. My first time there was on a busy Sunday afternoon. Didn't have to wait for a seat. The waitress was great. And the food portions and flavor was great."}
{"text":"The food is great, but the service leaves much to be desired (especially in the early morning hours)."}
{"text":"My mom recently moved down the street from this place and I was very excited to try all the new restaurants around her house. Blueberry hill was the first place we tried and it was a success!!! Absolutely delicious! I ordered the green chiliquellas, and they were perfect!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Waffles!!  They are all over Vegas, so whether you are staying on the strip, downtown or with family one is just a few minutes away!"}
{"text":"My family and I went to eat at this location last week, it wasn't our first time eating at Blueberry Hill. We got there told to sit where ever we wanted too, our orders were taken right away. The nice lady that took our order seemed a little confused on our orders even tho we were not changing anything . We simply picked meals from the menu. We had her come back once than she sent someone else to ask something else she had forgotten to ask. Food arrived quickly. My plate wasn't the one i picked out but it was fairly close and I didn't feel like going back to menu and pointing to the plate that i wanted once more. Our food  was amazing but when we got our bill she overcharged us for one of the plates and one of the drinks we got which was milk.  She was apologetic and fixed right away.  To sum it up things were good besides all the confusion."}
{"text":"This is my all time favorite bb hill! They have the best pancakes you will get ANYWHERE! The service is great due to the management. The manager is always up front helping with everything. You can really tell that she really cares about her customers. She knows a lot of them by name. It's a real family enviornment. I will only have breakfast here!!"}
{"text":"Great food, exelent service. Good prices. Good portions. A÷. We were three times and all of the people were friendly. Breakfast were hearty."}
{"text":"Nice and easy, no frills meals. Flap jacks ROCK.."}
{"text":"My wife and I were looking for somewhere to go to away from the strip. So I referred to Yelp for some suggestions, Love this app! Anyway we settled on the Blueberry Hill Family restaurant based on reviews. We were not disappointed, no wait to get in, the server was prompt with taking the drink order and was not annoyed with us taking a few minutes to look at the menu, it is rather large as it is a 24hr restaurant. I had a waffle with eggs an ham steak. My wife had an omelet with pancakes. The food arrived in a timely fashion and everything was very good. The server came back several times to check on us and was very friendly. Overall a very nice breakfast. I would highly recommend it if you want to dine away from the hustle of the strip."}
{"text":"I've ate here a couple times and I never had a bad experience until now..... I will admit we came late at night but there was only about 2 other people there and yet our food took about an hour to come out. Not only that but she \"forgot\" about my drink (I got a lemonade and it tastes like just water after having to remind her 20 minutes later) also didn't put chocolate chips in my friends pancakes even after she stated it was an extra charge .... to top it off when we were finishing our food a cockroach came crawling along the table. We had notified the waitress when we were paying and all she said was \"gross. How big was it?\" Like really.... that's it.... never coming back (: I wouldn't even rate it one star  but I have to to post this"}
{"text":"I have dined here many times and the food by far is pretty good. Just prepare your patience as the hospitality is terrible. Nancy was my waitress and did not like me at all. I waited for coffee and she didn't even bring me my meal. Some other guy brought my meal to me as I watched Nancy refill coffee cups and compliment the table next to mine. I had to flag her down for a second cup of coffee as I watched her combined other pots of coffee into one to refill my cup. I tried to complain to Phil the manager who seemed clueless and expected me to want my meal for free which I did not. Paid in full is what I did but promised to leave my remarks here and never return."}
{"text":"Just a great home town restaurant, great egg dishes, good pancakes, and decent coffee. Looking forward to going back. This place is a great call for breakfast. Service was good too."}
{"text":"I am NOT a  breakfast food person...  Most of the foods for breakfast are either too sweet OR they are eggs. I am not a fan of either. However ... there are times when there is this crazy craving for pancakes. To satiate this craving I head not to IHOP but to Blueberry Hill. They have the most awesome pancakes EVER. Now I am a creature of habit, so whenever I went I would get the blueberry pancakes with blueberry compote.  But then I discovered crepes... oh... my....gravy... the crepes... they are evil good... they pull you in and they want you to have them daily. They are super thin , and filled with a cream cheese filling ... and have compote on the top... ohhh yeah sign me up...  Then even better than that are the Rum Runner Pancakes .. they are coconut/pineapple captain morgan goodness that should be your go to for a carb overload... and comfort food friend. Delish!  Gotta say the staff is always friendly and always has amazing service. luh-luh LOVE IT  as soon as the foot is better i am trekking down for some serious pancake eating. :)"}
{"text":"My husband, myself and some members of my husband's family came here for breakfast while visiting Vegas.   This place looks like an old school diner. The prices were cheap and the food was mediocre but there was no smoking so I gave it an extra star.   The restaurant was very crowded when we came and we could not all sit together. Service was slow and inattentive.   The food was nothing to write home about and closely resembles Denny's or Carrows.   This restaurant offers cheap food if you have lost a lot of money gambling or if you need a meal because you are hung over but is definitely not serving food that would write home about."}
{"text":"Service was awesome and fast. You get a cup of coffee right away. I had a short stack of pancakes and country fried steak and eggs. The pancakes were so big and super fluffy. Country fried steak is a little small but it was good. I don't like the Texas toast that they serve with it. I already have toast on the side. I think it's too much. The gravy is so so. Hash browns were ok a little soggy/soft in the inside but I don't mind it. I think this place is better than eggworks on sunset. I think you get a better value for your money. Very nice diner atmosphere.  I like it"}
{"text":"The food is hit or miss. Just don't order the steak and eggs. I asked for medium and got well done. Returned it for a new one and got rare. Still bleeding and everything. Plus it had absolutely no flavor! Stick to the basic breakfast items, pancakes, bacon etc and you'll be fine."}
{"text":"No, just no! So mad! We've been going here for years. I think some of the menu items are absolutely delicious, some could be better. But nonetheless, this experience was a no.   Breakfast for my family, two adults-two kids, was $38. I was thinking, how is this possibly so high when I ordered one breakfast for me and shared it with my four year old, and all my six year old son had was a side of curly fries. Well I found it, $12 for kids drinks!! Twelve. Dollars. My husband and I had water, and we ordered two kids milks. When they were gone, I asked if there were refills on the milks. I know most restaurants don't refill on that product, but some do. So when the server said there are no free refills of milk, that was fine. Then I asked if we could  get something cheaper than milk, like iced tea, and she replied it was fine.   When I got the bill, the teas were charged. I took the bill to the register and told her we shouldn't have to pay for tea after paying $6 for two 12 ounce milks. I told her the server did not inform us there was an additional charge. She called our server over and the server said \"I told them there were no refills on milk.\" I said, well I took that as there's no refills of milk, and I asked if something cheaper could be the refill, and you said it was okay. I told them you should have said, I can get tea but it will be an additional charge, and I would have said never mind.  Either way, they we're rude about it, and dishonest. Because I pointed out that we were charged almost $3 PER cup. That is the adult price on a drink. She said it's the same size. I informed her I've worked in a restaurant. Those are 12 ounce cups and if that's what you charge for a 12 ounce drink that is a huge rip off. Tea is water and leaves, it shouldn't be that much for an adult or kid. A kids milk shouldn't even be $3. Rip. Off. It takes a lot to make me upset at a business or someone doing their job, but I don't appreciate the attitudes or a $38 bill for two breakfasts and a side of curly fries."}
{"text":"Heaping portions, fairly priced.   Try the blueberry pancakes - real bluberries in the batter with a blueberry compote on top. Careful, portions are huge!  Typical casual diner atmosphere. Located close to highway so it's easy to stop by on the way out of Vegas."}
{"text":"We lived in the area 20 years ago and we were used to come to this location for breakfast. We loved it.  So, when we came back in LV for a few days, we had to find it again. It was a bit difficult (old age...) but we finally found it and glad we did.  Food was good, service was good. Just as we remembered."}
{"text":"Breakfast is the most important meal of the day. We went with a group of about 20(mostly teenagers) people and our waitress was so kind and helpful to accommodate us. She even brought out extra whip cream! She was also quick to bring out our waters and kept the adults coffee cups full.  The food was not mind-blowing but the portions were good. The kids had happy tummies and so did we! 4 stars for the excellent service and satisfying food."}
{"text":"Continuing our snow-bird exploration of breakfast restaurants we couldn't pass up a place with so many reviews and so many good ones.  We arrived a bit later than usual and the waiting crowd spoke to the popularity of the place.  Being from a smaller Midwest city, having to wait at all is a bit of a put off, but okay, we aren't there, we are here.  It may be a bit nit-picky, but a couple who came in after us talked to the hostess and then had handshakes and hugs with the manager.  Then they were seated before us in a 4-seat booth by the window. A few minutes later we were escorted to the smallest table in the darkest corner of the restaurant.  It wasn't the worst thing that could have happened but it sure set a negative tone for our Valentines Day breakfast.     The waitress was reasonably prompt for a full and busy restaurant, but the food took a while.  I hold that restaurants know their popularity and should staff and deliver accordingly to accommodate their customers.    I had the Farmers Omelet and my wife had French Toast with scrambled eggs and bacon.  The main entrees, the omelet and French toast were very good.  The hash browns that came with the omelet were over cooked on the outside and virtually uncooked on the inside.  My wife's scrambled eggs were under cooked inside.   Taken altogether it was a good enough breakfast, but not so great as to justify the wait and not worthy of what the large crowds represented.  Since this place appears to be very popular I'll give them the benefit of the doubt that our experience was atypical.  But if you are going there, get there early unless you consider waiting in line part of a normal restaurant experience."}
{"text":"Best breakfast ever definitely coming back during my next date in Las Vegas! Biscuits and gravy, French toast mac, and cheese chicken and waffles all highly recommended. We walked in and were seated immediately great customer service."}
{"text":"Strongly suggested for breakfast! We WILL be back, often!  It was an absolute delight to try Blueberry Hill for the first time today! We stopped by about 10:30am after being told their was an hour wait to be seated at Mr Momma's. We were immediately seated. The restaurant was clean and well decorated. The staff was fast, friendly, helpful. And above all the breakfast was amazing!  I had the classic eggs Benedict, while my husband had the meat lovers scramble. Their was an abundance of food! The ham was thick cut, unlike any Benedict I have had before. As did my husbands meat lovers scramble, large cubes of ham. Would have prefered it a little thinner but wasn't a deal breaker by far :)"}
{"text":"This food could definitely be improved. Everything our table ordered was really gross and left mostly uneaten(monte cristos, liver and onions, etc). The only thing that was really good was their burger. So be careful what you order if you go here. It doesn't seem super clean and there are flies constantly bugging you as you eat at the table. Definitely has potential but needs work!"}
{"text":"I LOVE BLUEBERRY HILL. Everything about it. I do not think I have ever had a bad experience at this one off of Flamingo and Maryland. I have been there with 10 people and for such a small kind of place, they have always found space for us to sit together. I made friends with one of the older waitresses. She is adorable.   I have never waited a ridiculous amount of time for my food. One I came in at 9:15am, had my food at 9:20, give or take a minute. It was so fast.   It is inexpensive and open 24 hours! As a college student it is perfect for those late night cravings of some good french toast or anything really. When my family comes into town there is no doubt that when asked where do they want to eat this weekend, \"Blueberry Hill, duh!\" At least once they have to eat there when they are in town. Its awesome.   They have deals all the time too.  I had French Toast, Eggs, and Bacon for 5.99, but it was the before 11am special. I think thats pretty cheap and it is way way way better then Denny's even though I can't hate on Denny's too much. :)   On another visit, it was a busy Saturday, but the folks I was with, we had sat there and was walking for 3 hours and not once did they ask us to move or hurry up and leave when we finished eating 2 hours before. It was nice to just be able to sit there and converse with your friends and not being pushed away because they needed the tables for others.   They are pretty quick at getting tables cleaned and ready to go for the next guests as soon as the previous ones have left. I have never waited more than 20min, even when the parking lot was full and cars had to start parking on the street.   Great environment, great food, and the best french toast ever! (So far)"}
{"text":"On vacation and used Yelp to find this place. Love the diner atmosphere. My husband and I shared the smoked sausage skillet, and it was plenty for us. Very well flavored food. The waitress was amazing! Would come back for sure, and prices are reasonable!"}
{"text":"Great place to go just slightly off strip. They make all of their stuff there so it has home cookin homeade fantasticness. Their prices are ao much more reasonable than restaurants on the strip. They have daily dinner specials that come with sohp or salad and dessert. By the way...the split pea soup is AMAZING and the homemade cheesecake is so super yummy!  Sure Vegas haz glitzzy places to eat but that will certainly break your bank. If you have a car with you in Vegas it is worth your time to go here to save some money and get some mighty tasty food. We even went back for breakfast and the crepes were perfect. If you are in Vegas with your kids this is a definate must. They actually have a kids menu when many strip restaurants do not. They even have. 99 cent kids meals before 6 pm during the week. So worth it when with kids. Eating on strip with your kids is a money killer. This is my new eat in joint while in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Great find off the strip to save money and have a great meal.  People there are very kind."}
{"text":"$7.77 specials of a drink, soup or salad, entree, and then dessert is a great deal.  I will have to try this place again for their breakfast food."}
{"text":"Easy to find, food & service was great. They have an extensive menu, we went there for breakfast on a Thursday morning 9:30 ish & it was busy, but we were seated right away. I ordered the chicken & waffle w/ apple compote, it was delicious. Hubby ordered an omelette that took up his entire plate. Also got the potato chunks they were deep fried and amazing! Price is on point too;2 entrees, potatos & 2 coffees $30. We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"went here after a long day of working and was just looking for a quick bite with my room mates since we all hadn't gone here since we were small and have been getting tired of bad service at our local ihop... service was WONDERFUL here. sedelia paid close attention to us and what we asked for and our food came out of the kitchen tasting great! the menu is seriously huge, even a picky eater could find something they'd love in this menu. definitely will be coming back, we just don't get good service like this anywhere else."}
{"text":"This place is a local chain that is fairly dependable and reasonably priced. The Flamingo location, like all the others, gets busy from 9-12 on the weekends. But even during those busy times there is never an uncomfortable wait.   They have a crew of experienced waitresses, but lately they have been training new waitresses during those busy times.  This of course leads to some missteps, but it's never a huge inconvenience.  And the waitresses are always nice.     There was a menu shift a few years ago and Blueberry Hill revamped their menus at every location. They started offering more selections. It seemed to be an effort at competing with some of the national chains. Suddenly there were big laminated books filled with pictures of Chocolate Oreo Pancakes and Chilaquiles. I stay away from the Mexican food on the breakfast menu. It's OK at best.  Overall the quality of some of their dishes seemed to suffer a bit as a result of the changes. Hubby says the chicken fingers and ham steak have declined in the last few years.  The omelets and combos are still solid. I stick with my standby, the Waitress Special (eggs, waffle, and bacon or sausage).  Their waffle is a tasty surprise.  I've never been unhappy with it.     On Sundays there is often a kid out front selling the local paper. Even if you don't buy a paper from him, he holds the door for you. I haven't seen him for a while; I hope he's still around.  POSITIVE CHANGE: They carry Twinings Tea now.  That might not impress tea lovers, but it's a huge step up from the Lipton they've been carrying for years.   IN RETROSPECT: This hasn't been a positive review in the traditional sense. But it is a positive review. They are open 24 hours. I know what I'm going to get at Blueberry Hill. The wait is never long. The waffles are good.  And the people are pleasant.  In spite of the changes, I still like it here."}
{"text":"Visiting Las Vegas, we went twice for breakfast! Staff was always friendly and efficient, kept the coffee topped up. Huge menu, great selections. Prices are good and daily and late night specials are cheap! A good choice for out-of-towners like us to get away from the strip."}
{"text":"Love that it's a local place. Huge menu so be prepared to be a little overwhelmed. The portions are incredibly large so take that into consideration when ordering. Had banana pancakes and eggs. The cinnamon sauce was just ok. But the bananas were fresh. And the syrup is really good."}
{"text":"This place was really disappointing. We came here because of the good reviews and low price rating, but the prices were ridiculous for what they gave you. Definitely not worth it. The food looked so unappetizing I couldn't even look at it. I ordered the French toast breakfast, the eggs were okay at best, the hash browns looked and tasted awful, and the French toast just tasted weird. I came here starving but ended up hardly touching my food. Very disappointing, and I'm not picky. I don't recommend to anyone, if you want awesome cheap breakfast, go to Babystacks. It's the only place I clean my plate every time, and the prices are significantly less than this place."}
{"text":"\"You've never been to Blueberry Hill?\" asks the incredulous Vegan when I say after living here three years I've never eaten at the casual restaurant. \"Oh, you have to go, it's a Vegas staple!\"  So after a few drinks we needed something open late. We couldn't agree on a place open late that sounded good to everyone, and Blueberry Hill was close by.  Blueberry Hill is open 24 hours. It all goes downhill from there.  I ordered the chilequilas, which I had never had before. I guess they're like breakfast nachos. The food was absolutely mediocre at best. Now I know it's 1am, and fine dining isn't exactly what I'm looking for, but it at least should make me go \"Yum!\" instead of \"Oh...\" And around us, between the four, nothing was a stand out at all. Nothing said to us, \"Damn, that's what we SHOULD have ordered.\" (Although H. San's pancake stack looked mildly appealing.)  Service was awful. Again, I know it's 1am, and if you're a little understaffed, I understand. Grave is not an easy shift. But it doesn't take that long to refill a soda or coffee. How do I know this? Because after she had asked if we wanted refills, she proceeded to forget AND REFILL EVERY OTHER TABLE before a busser offered us refills.  So yeah. It'll be a long time before I come back to this dump. There, I've been to Blueberry Hill, I've done my duty as a Las Vegan, now leave me alone!"}
{"text":"I had breakfast this morning and it was nothing to write home about.  I had eggs with bacon and pancakes."}
{"text":"Me and boys came for a late night snack and WOW!! Everything was amazing the food was some of best in Vegas and the service was 10/10 Sally was our waitress and she was honestly the best server we have ever had in America! She really make me understand why America has the tipping system. And the price was just right I paid $6 for an amazing eggs ben. We will be back here again for sure!!"}
{"text":"A great choice for breakfast off the strip!  If you enjoy breakfast, you will have a hard time deciding what to pick from over 6 pages of breakfast items, including the classic (eggs benedict, country fried steak), to the interesting (Oreo pancakes, fried chicken and waffles). We had the chicken fried steak, which was excellent, and the banana pancakes, which are some of the best I've ever had. The portions are huge, the coffee is perfect, the prices are low and the service is good. The parking is easy, and it's only about 2 miles away from the strip."}
{"text":"First time here and I am so glad I stopped in. The food was fresh and delicious!  Service was great and this place stays open 24hrs!!!"}
{"text":"This was a great disappointment, after originally coming here based on other yelp reviews. I ordered one of their 8 omelet choices, and it was overcooked, and with pieces of fat instead of ham. It even had a bone splinter in there. The toast was soaked in butter, not that I asked for butter on it, but apparently that's the default. The hash-browns were OK, and the coffee kept coming, although it wasn't special.   I don't expect much from a cheap diner, but a decent omelet is minimum. My girlfriends High Protein, Low Calorie order also came with butter-dripping toast. Hmmmm  The elderly waitress was very sweet though, even after singing happy birthday twice to some of the other patrons. Such commitment.   Not recommended at all, very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Always excellent food and really great coffee!"}
{"text":"This is my brew favorite breakfast spot! I ordered the huevos rancheros and was not disappointed. I got mine spicy so you have options. It came with rice, refried beans, guacamole, and sour cream. The beans are made in house and this is not a Mexican restaurant. The rice was a little bland, but good with some salsa on it. I was completely surprised at this food. So much better than other places. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is an excellent place for family breakfast or brunch. The Four cheese Fresh & Fruity French Toast was fabulous - highly recommended! He had the Tennessee Fried Steak & Egs. He gives it a 4/5"}
{"text":"First time eating at this restaurant and it was nice.  Grilled Cheese was excellent.  Would have been nice had they waited and not cleaned the ceiling lamps in the middle of lunch.  otherwise an decent place to eat."}
{"text":"My wife and I are regulars at this place the employees treat us great food is great thanks to the cooks and we love the coffee never once have we had a bad experience till they either close or shut down for good my wife and I will continue to come eat here we both recommend this place"}
{"text":"Wow this place is really amazing. We just had breakfast and for just 9 dollars we got so much stuff: three eggs, three giant and super delicious pancakes, three strips of crispy bacon and three sausages!!! And the service is great too! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Love the friendly service and food is always top notch.  I'm a big fan of breakfast anytime of day, and Blueberry Hill's got it going on."}
{"text":"I asked the hotel receptionist where I could find a diner style breakfast, and immediately she said this place. Being from the south, I enjoy a good gravy & biscuit and MAN! It was good. The gravy was on point and a close rival to my Dads!  my toddler goes back and forth with her food but LOVED the bacon and sausage. If I could have changed one thing, I would have got a half size of the gravy biscuit plate cause it was massive! Either way, loved this place. Music was nice too! I was even impressed with the package of crayons, not some cheap ones thrown on the table that who know how many kids have used or put in the mouth. I will come here every trip back to Vegas!"}
{"text":"We're a family of 4 who loves eating at a diner! We were staying in Vegas & found the Blueberry our last night there. We were so happy we did! My boys loved their food. I had the French toast which was the best I've ever had! The waitress said it's brioche bread made for them by a nearby bakery. My husband had chicken parmigiana & loved it. We even got a piece of chocolate cake to split (on the house!!!) which was also delish. Lisa, our waitress took good care of us. GO.... you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Hard to not like this place if you're local.  Class breakfast diner.  Great pancakes.  Decent service.  Again great pancakes.   I'm a regular."}
{"text":"I'm a regular.  Pancakes are great.  Service is decent.  It's one of those places where I can't help but to get the same thing every time I go despite saying I don't want to the same thing.  Way better than IHOP or Denny's or one of the crappy chain places.    BBH is the way to go.  A Vegas tradition for 20+ years probably.  Flamingo location is equally as great even if in a bad neighborhood."}
{"text":"One of the best places for breakfast in Vegas.  Fast service, excellent food and they always keep your coffee cup full.  My personal favorite is the Guadalajara skillet with a blueberry muffin."}
{"text":"First of all, I just want to make it known that I've never written a review for any restaurant/diner/eatery.  But this place serves the BEST breakfast.  We were in Vegas for 4 days and luckily happened to find it by chance the first day we were there....we ate breakfast at this place all 4 days...that's how darn good it was!  My kids are picky eaters and for them to want to go back to a restaurant just surprised me.  The customer service is excellent, the food is fantastic and the prices are even better.  Lots of great food for great prices!  Definitely 2 thumbs up for this place!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love Love their biscuits and gravy!  My kids love the mac n cheese.  And the french toast is phenomenal.  No need to go to crappy dennys or ihop anymore with this good old fashioned diner!!"}
{"text":"Excelent  breakfast  with mother in law  and my son's great grandparents that came to visit from Texas.   They love it and so did I . I had great delicious 3 cheese toast with fresh blueberries  and strawberries .  Staff is amazing  our food came right away ."}
{"text":"I stayed close to this restaurant at Palms Place. I ordered the fried steak, scrambled eggs, english muffin, along with one pancake. The pancake was large and thick. I usually like thin pancakes. But I can seriously say that that was the best pancake I have ever had."}
{"text":"Just called this location to find out if the new location on Flamingo and Decatur was open yet.  The Lady who answered the phone was so rude. I asked if the location was open yet she said \"yes\" and hung up on me.  If you don't like working with the public QUIT!!"}
{"text":"Diane is amazing! We came by yesterday and loved it so much that we had to come again today! For those that know my family they know to get my mother-in-law to go somewhere twice and love it both times is a miracle! She loved Diane so much we had passed another location and my husband asked of we wanted to just stop there instead bit me and her both said oh no we have to go see if Ms Diane is working, the food is amazing! And huge portions plenty to share or take to go, desserts are heavenly.  Everything tasted wonderful!"}
{"text":"Yummm! Hello breakfast! So remember those hole in the wall diners back home that you love so much and they make the most ah-mazing breakfasts 24hrs a day? This is one of them! [Of course its not quite like yours at home because this one has slot machines, but so does every gas station in the state...I digress]. I had the chicken fried steak and it was delish! And I absolutely had to steal a bite (ok a lot of bites) of the french toast which was soooo delicious. Like melt in my mouth delicious. So its six hours later and I'm still full. What's not to love?"}
{"text":"Delicious home made food!!!! Pancakes & creeps are delicious!!! Best breakfast I've ever had in restaurant.  Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service and great prices. We would eat there again in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"We hit this place on almost every trip. I really love it that much!! Generally I'm a pancake guy, I eat them all hours of the day, but this place works some magic with the French toast.   I don't know how they do it. It's crispy but not hard and the perfect amount sweet. They are so good they don't need syrup, I'll say that again but in all caps, because this needs to be yelled from the top of Mt Charleston.    THE FRENCH TOAST IS SO GOOD IT DOSENT NEED SYRUP!!!!!!!!  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I've been eating blueberry hill since 1988... They have been always consistent with there food.  Till lately!   Prices have gone way up and the the food quality has gone way down.  Pancakes have changed somehow... Either the cooks don't know how to make them correctly anymore or they have changed something... Oh they are still ok, but they used to be so good.  The coffee the last couple times has been off as well.   Yes i still visit but once every two months instead of 3-4 times a month.  I just feel that i can get as good a quality food and a better priced breakfast closer to my house instead of driving for 30 minutes."}
{"text":"Thanks giving breakfast in this location was awesome. We kind of came early , that was good so we were seated promptly. The coffee alone deserves 5 star. Very attentive waitress. This is a local joint so I will support it over any chain. Talk about food, for breakfast you cant them, delicious and good portion."}
{"text":"Great friendly service, yummy food. Good pricing. I would recommend to anyone wanting a good American breakfest."}
{"text":"My favorite place for breakfast. The menu is huge and and offers most all you can think of. I also enjoy coming here for dinner. The place is like an old fashion diner. Good service and nice sized portions. I've been going to BB for years and have never had a bad experience. I highly recommend it. A Vegas original."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely horrible.  Save your money.  Dirty and pathetic food portions and presentation. We wouldn't return to this restaurant if was the last place to eat in Vegas and we are locals."}
{"text":"Cute diner, large portions, and great customer service. Large menu to choose from, and we ordered breakfast at 3pm."}
{"text":"Tables are small, so get a booth.  Food is REALLY good.  HUGE portions.  None of us could finish everything..."}
{"text":"One waitress for the whole restaurant.  I get it that they want to make tips, and the more servers the less each one makes.  But as a guest I don't care.  I want my order taken quickly and my water glass at least half full at all times."}
{"text":"5 stars from me for a great Diner! The food was delicious. The chefs can really cook a good medium well steak! Better than some expensive restaurants I have been to.  Went here with my parents and my family and everyone was pleased.  I had the steak and eggs which was great.  They deserve an award for the best teamwork I have ever seen at a restaurant.  If you even look up at one of the employees they will ask you if you need anything.  Awesome! No trying to flag down a server for food questions or extra napkins here!  Everybody pitches in to make the experience good and quick, though it was very busy."}
{"text":"Blueberry hill never disappoints. I've been coming here as long as I can remember. Probably because my mom was a waitress here for 15 years when we moved to Vegas in 1990. Although some of the servers aren't as attentive as they could be, they're all very friendly & the food is what keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"Awesome alternative to the hustle and bustle of the strip. Great pancakes and coffee."}
{"text":"Compared to Hash House A Go Go, this is definitely the better place to eat breakfast food. Their pancakes are very good."}
{"text":"food ~ four stars service ~ negative stars?!?  this is a definite in late night or next morning eating! i am a total omelet freak and theirs are for sure at the top of my list! it's terrible because every time i eat here, i find myself so painfully full because their portions are so big. then i feel awful not eating all of my de-lish omelet! :-/ ahhh what's a girl to do?! i mean you can't take an omelet to go... that just doesn't work?!?! eh.   i do have a complaint though... this last weekend the service was awful! i don't know if my friends and i were just having one of those days where no one wanted to take our orders or be attentive but the server was nowhere near on his game. then after we were done eating we were all sitting there chatting and telling jokes when some guy who worked there asked if we were paying with credit cards. when we told him yes, he proceeded to tell us we needed to pay now because he was closing the terminal down. ummmm ok?!?! wtf... isn't this place 24 hours?!?! so we got up, paid and got out.   we left happy with our food but really unhappy with the lack of any sort of service!"}
{"text":"Mmmmm!! Great place to catch breakfast! They have the most amazing pancakes, light and fluffy and of course with a to. Of butter! That with a side of blueberry compote, can't be beaten! Large servings make the prices reasonable and the food is always hot and fresh! Never too crowded so easy to get in and out quickly, or to lounge and enjoy your Sunday paper!"}
{"text":"Holy COW!  The pancakes are massive, and they are so tasty.  We brought the family of five in and we had a variety of items from chocolate chip and blueberry pancakes to omelets with potatoes.  Everyone was stuffed and happy.  Our server was super friendly and quickly took our order (seeing that we had kids.)   That is always appreciated.  If you're visiting Vegas and thinking of overpaying at one of the casino joints for mass produced breakfast, think again, and give this place a try."}
{"text":"Will never step foot in this restaurant again, based on the manager's inability to manage crowds and customers.  If not all people in your party are present, he will not seat you until everyone has arrived because, in his words, you are taking up valuable space!!!  At the time, it was just my husband and I and we were waiting for our son and his fiancé to arrive.  We waited 15 minutes, while other people were being seated two to a booth, ahead of us.  When I questioned the manager about this, he became upset and said we were welcome to leave and find another restaurant!!!  Food portions and prices were good.  Bathrooms were filthy.  We opted to go up the street to the Blueberry Hill at 3790 E. Flamingo Rd. and were seated promptly, food service was good and friendly.  Portions were great."}
{"text":"Every time we're in Vegas, we make sure to stop off for our favorite Cinnamon Swirl Pancakes.  DEEEEE-lish!  Lots of items to choose from.  Friendly and courteous staff.  You cant go wrong with these prices, service and portions.  You won't go hungry!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place. Big selection, big, tasty food, a nice atmosphere and super service made this a place we're looking forward to hitting again next time we're in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Get the Apple Chicken Sausage!!!  I love eating breakfast at this place... I look forward to eating here everytime I'm in Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible Sunday afternoon service! Arrived here and my family was sat immediately, but the table was oblong with one seat on one side and three seater across, so one of my kids was on one side alone while the three of us sat together. Oh well. But it took 15 minutes to get our order taken, and it was only because we asked another waitress (Emma, super sweet). After waiting another 15 minutes, our assigned waitress (forgot her name) forgot my sons drink and brought water instead. Oh well. But a couple arrived, had their order taken before ours and got their food before us. We wasted over a half hour for water. Our food was no where in sight and our waitress didn't even bother to come back to our table so we left. Will never come here again. Very poor service."}
{"text":"Its not too bad, food is decent, service waitress Linda was very nice and attentive, 5-stars just for her :)   This is and older fashion breakfast diner, if thats what your looking for you'll enjoy it."}
{"text":"Great food! The food was absolutely amazing! I ordered the pork chops with hash brown and eggs. The coffee was delicious. Only reason I am giving this place three stars is because the workers can be a little bit more professional. My wife and I stopped here while we visit Vegas, and were looking for a cafe sort of environment. Our waitress Raven was taking care of us. She did very well in attending us. The cooks on the other hand, need some serious training. We sat at the bar area and right away we were able to tell that one of the cooks had no idea what he was doing. He was complaining super loud and started arguing with one of the waitress. She as well continued the argument instead of brushing it off. A young server also stood next to the waitress and called the cook a name.. it was super busy so it might have been stress that caught up to them, but that is very unprofessional and there is no excuse for them arguing in front of their customers."}
{"text":"This place never lets me down.  Order anything off the menu! its all good!  The service is great here.  I go regularly and have never gotten bad service.  Excellent Pancakes!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the extreme lack of customer service at this location. We have been eating at and picking up food and pies from this location many times over the past few years however this evening when trying to purchase a whole pie, we were told it needed to be ordered 24 hours in advance. Again, we have been walking in and purchasing whole pies for years, now it's apparently their unwavering company policy to refuse such a transaction.   Food is mediocre at best, only good thing about this place was the chocolate pie and quite frankly I'd get friendlier service from the frozen food section at any grocery store."}
{"text":"Go here all the time when working since it is open 24hrs great selection on the menu and always have had great service. Would recommend anyone to come here if your looking for a late night meal."}
{"text":"I had the sausage and cheese omelet.  I was hoping that with high reviews for this place they would make the simple things very well.  The eggs we rubbery, the home fries were underdone, and the wheat toast was thin.    I was a lot of food but not good food.  I will not be back.   They do have good service! Good servers."}
{"text":"If i could give it less than a 1 i would. Ate there yesterday(7-23-10) at about 12 P.M. The waitress tried to seat our party of 8 in to a small table so that we (Would not take up her table) yes, she actually told us that. Ordered drinks and she left before taking everyone's drink order. After she returned she brought the rest of the drink and she took our meal order. The first 2 plates arrived 30 minutes later, the next 2 ten minutes later. The last 3 meals arrived 15 minutes later, and they were not correctly made. A milk shake that was ordered upon arrival was never brought. We asked for a manager numerous times and one never appeared. At one point they sent out a dishwasher that just nodded at us. The table  next to us arrived 10 minutes after we did, and they received their food about 20 minutes before us. Their food all arrived at the same time, and keep in mind they were a bigger party. Maybe the server taught they were better tippers. After we finished the bland meal, we received two separate checks. As we went to pay we noticed that they automatically add a 15 percent gratuity to the check. That was the last straw, we informed the hostess that we would pay the bill but no the gratuity. One of the servers told her to do so, the manager never came out. DO NOT EAT THERE, waste of time for bad food."}
{"text":"I love this place. I went for the first time this past April. Loved it. Brought my husband this time and he loved it too. One of my favorite places to eat in Vegas."}
{"text":"Ok servers are friendly the food is always good who can't complain about that !!!! But have you ever look at the floors are really bad rust around the legs of the seats it's like they never cleaned it and around the walls you can see the build up for a long time sorry  but should be in better shape this place need a lot of work but good food and servers are great"}
{"text":"Waitress was nice but just our luck we were sat in front of the bathroom  and not five minutes later a sketchy man walked into the mens room followed by a sketchy woman. After giving her the benefit of a doubt twenty minutes later I told a staff member and didn't do anything about it... When they finally came out he was sweaty and nasty... Made us feel dirty.. Never coming back again... Food is not worth it."}
{"text":"Would come everyday if I lived in Vegas !! Something to eat for the whole family. From the Green Chile Chilaquiles to the French Toast."}
{"text":"An absolutely terrific place to have breakfast; their French toast combos was wonderful, and ditto for the orange juice. The service was wonderful.  I'll definitely come back here the next time I visit las vegas"}
{"text":"Used to love this place.... Called to place a togo order.... the response was \"i need to ask you three questions first.... you realize this is Charleston and Decatur?\"  :\"yes...\" \"Do you have a credit card to secure the order?\" \"Yes...\" \"will your order be more than 25 dollars?\"  Seriously i mean wtf?? I said i had a card... All i wanted to do was order breakfast then i get left on hold for 10 mins....Hung up and Wont be returning."}
{"text":"Used to go here quite frequently when I lived nearby. Sadly, the prices are up, and the quality is down.  It's always been a bit of a dive kind of place - but this is the first time that I remember it actually being gross. Tables were sticky. Glasses had lipstick marks.   I don't know what was going on, but the staff was having some kind of angry discussion about work and tips - quite loudly. A manager seemed to be in on it too - complaining in front of customers about the lack of cleanliness behind the counter. If this was supposed to make us feel better, it didn't.  I ordered the most basic breakfast - 2 eggs, bacon, toast, coffee - and a side of a single potato pancake. The total was almost $16. The coffee alone was close to $3 - and was pretty dismal.  When I asked the server about the price, she said that I had ordered a breakfast combo called \"the Bonanza\" minus hashbrowns and pancakes. Plus an added single potato pancake. I told her that I had never ordered that combo - never even heard of it - and reiterated both what I had ordered and what I had received. She said that she didn't know how to ring that up, so had just put in an order for the Bonanza - minus about half of the meal - but still charged me the full price.   This feels like some sort of weird combination of incompetence and robbery. In the long run, it's probably only the difference of a couple of bucks - but it feels skeevy.   Seriously not impressed with the facilities, the servers, or the food."}
{"text":"Blueberry Hill is a good place for breakfast. Came here at the end of our Vegas trip and we were seated right away. I ordered the breakfast skillet with meat and hash browns, I forgot the exact name on the menu. The skillet was much better than I had expected. It was quite delicious. The place is fairly clean and the customer service is decent."}
{"text":"Great food and not pricey! Always try to get my girlfriend to take me when I'm visiting her"}
{"text":"The best pancakes and french toast you will find in town. Their pancake batter is full of flavor and their have a variety of pancakes. French toast is real good too. The price is decent and the food portions are good. Dessert is also great and so are their Malts."}
{"text":"Great pancakes!  They were fluffy and flavorful!!!  Thanks Yelpers for the recommendation!!!  I am very picky about pancakes because our homemade cakes are much better than I can find in a restaurant... But Blueberry Hill makes great flapjacks!  That said, we had to try the strawberry and apple toppings - fortunately we got them on the side... They had a canned taste, they were awful.  I am docking a star for the toppings.  Stick with the Maple syrup!  The atmosphere is like a 50's diner.  They have an impressive menu with specials on display when you walk in the door.    We will be back next time we are in Vegas!    This area is a bit inconvenient to get to from the Strip, I also would not recommend going at night...  There were some interesting people wandering around during the day...  Definitely much better than other breakfast / pancake houses places in Las Vegas.  Avoid the fake sugary fruit toppings... They will ruin your breakfast!"}
{"text":"The meal was delicious and the portions huge.  I had the chicken parmigiana - yum!!!!!"}
{"text":"Reminds me if IHOP but way way way better! I had the corn beef hash eggs benedict. I will be craving it for years! Don't make it to Vegas much but will remember this little gem when I do. Hubs had an omelet- fed him for two breakfasts! Raven was a good sport putting up with the hubs teasing her about liver and onion omelets lol."}
{"text":"Overall, this place was awesome! The service was prompt, the food was very tasty, and the menu was super extensive, with tons of stuff for just about any craving. My wife had the banana pancakes, and I had the Guadalajara skillet. Between the other people at our table (8 total) we had the french toast, the spinach omelet, and the normal American breakfast. All of the dishes were hot, fresh and good. We will definitely go back next time we are in town!  Bonus: all of the menu items are available 24hrs a day, I could definitely see myself coming back here at 2 in the am for some good grinds to help me forget about the money I lost gambling!"}
{"text":"Very good food and great service! My friend loved their French toast and I have to admit they were tasty. The only ding I have is that the omelets were not as fluffy as I like to have them. Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Nice clean diner with an extensive menus.  It could use some renovation but it is so clean I don't even care.  Excellent service and excellent food.  We will definitely be back the next time we are in town."}
{"text":"We've been to a few in the Las Vegas area, honestly we keep going back to the old school one on flamingo off of 515. They are quick to seat you, food is great and you get more of that homey diner feel than the others. Other locations were just fine too but we will probably keep going back to that one for those ridiculously fluffy pancakes."}
{"text":"This is our favorite breakfast spot in Vegas, whenever we have guests in town we will bring them here and they always end up loving it.   The only thing that frustrates about this place is the menu, it is so jam packed with options that it makes it hard to find out what you want!!!"}
{"text":"Found an egg shell in my eggs benedict! Gross! Server seemed unconcerned. We ordered one of the freshly baked pies and got a messy pie slice to which she said \"Sorry not the best pie getter-outer\" The pie no longer looked appetizing so I tried ordering a plate of the kids pancakes and she said she could not sell them to me because I was not 11. We ordered 2 entrees, a desert, hot chocolate. All lacking flavor except the hot chocolate. Horrible service with no effort to make it better. Usually don't write reviews but this one was needed. My server's name was Rebecca \"Becca\"."}
{"text":"A great little local chain with great size portions and good food.  The staff was friendly, but perhaps a bit slow. I never felt like my needs weren't being met, and there was plenty of coffee and creamer to be had.  If you are a local you are probably going to enjoy it here more than if you are coming from the strip.  They don't trip over themselves to cater to you, but they are certainly not ignorant of your wishes.  Honestly my biggest complaint during my visit was a Fluorescent Ballast near the table that was humming an annoying tune during breakfast.  I mentioned it to the hostess, so hopefully future patrons won't have to listen to the 'Ballad of the Faulty Ballast'."}
{"text":"Oh yeah! Friends introduced us to Blueberry Hill and now it's the only place I want to do breakfast in Vegas. Off the strip, busy but they'll move the line quickly and it's worth the wait. Friendly staff, good service and great food. I had the apple pancakes and there's more than enough to share! Good coffee too, and they'll bring you milk on the side if you ask and don't want the fake creamers. They were able to seat our table of 6 plus infant with ease, and we didn't feel rushed, able to stay and talk plenty. My husband had an omelette, others had the chicken fried steak, coconut chicken and waffles and the cinnamon roll pancakes. Everything looked amazing! It's a casual diner, so we're not talking fine dining, but it's a great late breakfast/brunch place to hang."}
{"text":"Yea I'm a fan. I had the apple sausage waffles. Delicious."}
{"text":"This is our family spot, its sooo welcome and the food is always amazing!  I love the breakfast food no matter what time of day we go (: lol.   The dinner is great and they have amazing deals!   Also the cake is YUM!"}
{"text":"This is a nice Bluebery Hill restaurant. It's well-lighted inside and plenty of parking. The breakfast options, especially the pancakes, are top notch. I'd say the best in town. They have a wide selection of other items, too. Burgers are great and so are the onion rings. Friendly staff, too. Reasonable prices. They have some kind of special deals almost every day. Worth checking out."}
{"text":"This is Blueberry Hills newest location. They took over and remodeled the old Marie Callendar's building. It looks great inside now. Very modern and clean. Casual atmosphere.  I think this is the first BH with a small bar area.   If you're looking for a real \"old school\" breakfast, this is the place. Best pancakes in town plus a wide variety of bacon, eggs, sausage, hash browns and the well-known blueberry muffins (I usually get a couple to go).  They have plenty of good lunch and dinner items, too. Turkey dinner is a favorite and burgers, too. I'd probably go here more often if they had Salmon, Prime Rib or maybe even a Ribeye steak but that's just me. Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of items to choose from.  The desserts, especially the chocolate cake, are delicious. They have several specials every day, too.  Plus they have good parking despite being on one of Las Vegas's busiest streets - Flamingo. I still like the BH on Decatur, too."}
{"text":"Omg!!! Portions are huge, split a meal.  I had the amazing cinnamon pancakes, my husband had blueberry pancakes and our friend had biscuits and gravy.  I would loved to have tried the cake, but was too full.  I would live to come back here!!"}
{"text":"Blueberry Hill Family restaurant Decatur has gone WAYYYY down hill, the food quality is atrocious, the prices absolutely outrageous, and the specials are never available when you want one.  The last time we went it was at 6pm and they \"claimed\" to be OUT of the special only an hour into their dinner service?  Methinks not.  Never again will we attempt to dine at this establishment."}
{"text":"Blueberry Hill's a terrific \"coffee shop\" type restaurant in Las Vegas (several locations). It's exactly what you expect a coffee shop to be. On our latest visit before catching a flight out of Las Vegas,...the one at 1505 Flamingo, near the airport. I had the corned beef hash omelet with pancakes and my wife had Huevos Rancheros, she asked for the eggs \"scrambled\" and there were no issues with the substitution...just a \"sure thing\" response. Very nice. Always great service at Blueberry Hill.bThe corned beef hash omelet was terrific, and solved the issue of \"hash browns or pancakes?\" as the side. Their pancakes are wonderful (not a mix). The hot sauce with the huevos rancheros was \"home-made\" and terrific. She's a \"hot sauce snob\" and said it was among the best she's had. Been to Blueberry Hill many times...highly recommended."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant after several IHOP visit on our trip to Vegas for a conference (back in February, just now getting caught up on my Yelps). Its a greasy environment for sure, but the food was very good. It was very busy Saturday morning, and the wait was about 15-20 minutes to be seated, so not bad at all. Everyone enjoyed what they ordered. The portions were very big and reasonably priced. Unfortunately, we were hitting the road back to Texas as we left the restaurant, so we couldn't take leftovers or we definitely would have. Will go back when in town again."}
{"text":"Wow, as good as it gets is right. I was in Vegas promoting a world premiere of an indy film and I wanted breakfast in a non-smoking restaurant. A gal at CVS (thank you!) told me about Blueberry Hill, and it was the best suggestion I'd had in ages!  The service was top notch, the food top notch. My only semi-complaint was that I only wanted about half the serving size, that they didn't offer. But it was so good, I just had to indulge anyway!  The entire staff was friendly. I actually asked for their business card so that I could do this Yelp review. Yes, I liked it that well!  Restaurants vary on the quality/flavor of sausage gravy and biscuits. Blueberry Hill did not disappoint (I ordered the eggs, sausage and biscuit with sausage gravy). Even the coffee was good, and never hit bottom!"}
{"text":"5.10.08: This spot is suppose to be the place where the locals come and eat. True? Not sure but whatevers I'm just hungry.  Decent prices great portion. Their pancakes and french toast is light and fluffy which is nice. It is satisfying and tasty. Very crowded place.  Want good breakfast? Come here. And no its not like norms, dennys or ihop. Its BETTER!"}
{"text":"First time coming here with my hubby. Huge proportions, fairly priced. I would suggest one more person at night for staffing. It's pretty busy for 3am, and only one lady to help everyone. Love the look of their pies, and most of their menu items look good, too. He had the Pancake Sandwich, I had the grubsteakers. So much food! Will be back!"}
{"text":"The greatest thing about living in Las Vegas is their 24 hour local diner. I woke up very early in the morning and already was craving for a wholesome meal. At the entrance of this restaurant, there is an aqua blue wooden bench, with a cartoon inspired image of pueblos, rocky mountains and cactuses. I think it's rather clever they did that, it's a creative tactic for a comical photo opp. The server that took our order is Sally, she's polite and attentive. Initially I wanted to try the Coconut Honey Chicken Waffle, but it wasn't available at the time. So I chose Chicken Fried Steak, which comes with their homemade biscuit, country gravy, veggies, and is usually served with mashed potatoes. Since they were out of mashed potatoes, Sally offered if I'd be okay with curly fries instead. I said Yes! And I am so thankful. I like the comfort food of chicken, biscuit, gravy and fries. They do give a generous portion. It's enough to share a meal and still bring home leftovers."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot in Vegas.  Huge menu, nice staff.  If you want to escape the casinos for meal this is a very nice option."}
{"text":"Breakfast: Fast service once you get seated. The wait is horrible if you have a party of 4+. Coffee okay. I wouldn't get it again. I like how kids eat for .99cents everyday between 3pm-6pm. The plates are decently priced (between $10-$15). Big servings. I ordered the country fried steak plate and it was flavorful."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend decided to eat here because of \"word of mouth\" and it is nothing short of greatness. We were greeted with open arms and welcomed as newbies. They helped us figure the menu out (there are so many choices that it can be quite overwhelming if your new) and waited on us with smiles. I ordered a skillet with potatoes, grilled onion, bell peppers, tomatoes, and 2 over easy eggs, the meal also came with two thick slices of toast, the time in between ordering and receiving  wasn't too bad either. All in all the experience was great!"}
{"text":"Would give it 3 stars food was just ok and service was slow and server didn't even come visit us once after we got our food. Only thing that is saving them was that blueberry pancakes are to die for and syrup came warm."}
{"text":"This place deserves no stars. I've been to multiple Blueberry Hills before and this was my first time eating at this location and what a horrible experience it was. No one even bothered to acknowledge me except for the busboy who brought me my drink and a lovely lady named Laurie who was the host. All the waiters didn't even bothered to ask if I was ready to order they kept walking pass my table and was taking orders for other tables that have been seated way after I was. And even after Laurie told one of the waiters that I was ready to order, the waiter shrugged Laurie off her shoulder and the waiter wasn't doing anything at that moment and the waiter pawned me off to a different one. I even asked for my check early so I can just pay for it already without having to wait, because I had to go to work afterwards. And when I told the waiter she said I couldn't get the check yet. I was really upset with everything here, I will never go to this Blueberry hill again and don't recommend this location to anyone. Blueberry hill is a really awesome restaurant to go to, but only at the other locations. Their customer service was just completely horrible!"}
{"text":"Came in today for a simple lunch had a turkey club and a chicken salad waitress was very friendly very nice her name was Nicki will be back"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place...go there everytime i am in Las Vegas.  Great food and reasonable prices.  Get the cinnamon swirl pancakes....to die for"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place. It was not too far from Circus Circus where we were staying. It's like an old school cafe everything is fresh and homemade. It was the first time I ever had eggs Benedict and I ordered the one with potatoes. It was heaven... my whole family loved the food. And it wasn't a crazy wait for being spring break."}
{"text":"I was just talking to my husband about this place...he did not remember it but we had breakfast here about 17 years ago on vacation...I am embarrassed to say we haven't been to LV since, but I still remember the awesome breakfast we had here!"}
{"text":"French Toast that is so good you can eat it with sugar free syrup and still Mmm....  This is some of the best french toast I've EVER had!  And when the price tag is under $8, I'm stoked!  This place is a little divey which makes it that much more appealing on a Sunday morning in Las Vegas.  Go here and order the French Toast Combo No. 2!  You won't regret it."}
{"text":"I love coming to Blueberry Hill!! I have been coming to Blueberry hill for some time now and I have always enjoyed everything I've had. All of the servers we have had have been amazing and consistent. My go to meal here is the grubsteaker dinner which is always tasty and the iced coffee is very good too."}
{"text":"nice family style diner type of food....friendly service, though a bit rushed because this place is either understaffed (which it doesnt seem to be) or just overwhelmed by the tons of people who come in here...coffee is fine if you like 50's diner coffee (read weak and unmemorable) instead of groovy Peet's or Starbucks's strong and manly....food is pedestrian, or thoroughly average...not bad not great but there....amusing atmosphere for the kids, watching all the rushing around...if you're in the neighborhood give it a try, but surely there are better breakfast places in Lost Wages...."}
{"text":"I ordered the cornbeef hash eggs Benedict, wanted to try something new rather than just the regular eggs Benedict. The cornbeef hash I think was out of a can which I don't mind but it wasn't cooked and was very mushy. It came with a side of chunky potatoes and they were good at first but a few bites into it the potatoes tasted different, almost a rotten taste. There was also an egg shell in my potatoes which I'm glad I saw before I accidentally ate. Service was VERY good and the waitress was really nice and quick. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"We like this place.  A little loud, and somewhat run down, but the staff was quick and friendly.  The pancakes were pretty good, as was the waffle.  The bone in ham, as well as the bacon, were great.  Potatoes were cooked very well and seasoned great.  It's a good place for breakfast that I'm sure we'll visit again when we are back in Vegas."}
{"text":"I came here for a nice quiet breakfast by myself the other day and it was decent. I got a waffle and some egg whites. The coffee was pleasant. It took a little while to get service though, probably about 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Great food but not worth the horrible service. Food is an 8 but service is a real zero.  First we were kept waiting 15 minutes after getting to the front of the line because the  needlessly overwhelmed older latin employee wanted to wait for a bigger table for our party of 7.  Instead of putting us in 2 tables of 4 as we had asked for he ignored me and continued to make us wait while he sat 5 more tables of 4 that should have been for us. The larger table was only for 6 so we had to pull up a chair and were so horribly cramped there wasn't room for the food.  After giving up we had to ask for coffee, had no setups from our younger hispanic waitress who seemed like it was her 1st day ever. Our service took forever and we had to actually flag down our waitress if we needed anything because she never asked us. When I tried to wash my hands there was no soap or towels but no one seemed to care when I told them. My days of recommending and raving about the food are over. The rude and most horrible service ever just not worth it."}
{"text":"OMG. This place is awesome. The only reason that you will have to wait a long period of time for your food is because you can't make up your mind on what you order from the menu everything here was delicious! The prices were reasonable for two people we spent about $30 but there was more than enough to eat and leave on your plate lol. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Nothing fancy, just a solid, well prepared breakfast selection supported by a friendly, competent waitstaff. Menu is large with many options, I choose the short stack of pancakes which was to much to be finished. Others in the group had omelets and the typical breakfast fare. Everything was nicely cooked and served without delays.   Pricing was under $10 per person, restaurant was comfortable and clean and servers could not have been nicer to us.   Nice place to start your morning!"}
{"text":"OMGosh, I think I OD'd and went to blueberry heaven!  So I was being my usual indecisive self and couldn't decide on what I want for breakfast. I eventually narrowed it down to \"blueberry\" so I quickly searched on my Yelp app and this place came up.   Blueberry pancakes topped with more blueberries! YUM! (see pics!)  And instead of coffee, my friend and I ordered an old-fashioned vanilla sundae and poured blueberry syrup on it. So delish!  Service is eh. I probably got the same server as Lara. It was a bit slow but the food was definitely worth the wait :)"}
{"text":"I love family restaurants. This place is on point with their food and great service. I always eat here."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this Blueberry Hill and its definitely not up to par to the others in town. The restaurant is extremely dark and luckily we sat by a window which brought in some light. Our server was decent and not the most attentive, we waited a while before she came to take our orders even though she only had one other table she was waiting on and hardly anyone in the restaurant.   When she did come take our order it was rushed and she didn't give me the option of choosing my sides or how I wanted my steak cooked she literally walked off as I said what I wanted. I did order the grubsteaker which had unique flavor to it and only ate half of it. Luckily the desserts are consistent with the other locations which saved this restaurant visit. I think ill skip this location next time around and visit another restaurant nearby instead."}
{"text":"ZOWWWWIEE! CHOCOLATE CHIP PANCAKES!!!  Or any of their pancakes for that matter.  Eat'em while they're hot!!!   Other than that, everything is really good.  My favorite is the Mexican Scramble with eggs over-easy.  Coffee is very good (even though the mugs are tiny).  Prices are very reasonable.  Open 24 hours.  Wear some loose fitting clothes because YOU WILL GET FULL!  Why 4 stars instead of 5? Only because the place looks a bit dirty.  Your first time there, you may be put off by the appearance of the place, but once you sink your teeth into the chocolate chip pancakes, you won't remember.  And you'll be back. I go here every-time I'm in LV and I'm in LV several times a year."}
{"text":"Of all my visits to Vegas I can't believe it's only taken me 19 years to discover this 24 hour breakfast gem! I liked it so much we visited twice!  Round one: My husband had the french toast combo, excellent french toast! I had scrambled eggs w cheddar. Bonus was having my eggs w flour tortillas and homemade salsa. Be careful it is spicy!  Round two: My mom ordered turkey dinner w homemade cranberry sauce and yummy stuffing. It came w tasty chicken noodle soup! Since I'm a breakfast lover I had the spinach and cheddar omelette, again accompanied with flour tortillas and homemade salsa. I loved every bite.  The two different servers that we had were friendly, caring, and always had a smile. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Roach! Roach! Roach!!!    How disgusting can a restaurant be?!?!  We dined at this particular Blueberry Hill restaurant last weekend because we were all in the mood for breakfast food, and we were in the area.  It was late in the evening, so we were told that we could sit anywhere we wanted.  We selected one of the round/horseshoe shaped booths in the corner.  Our meal was great.  We had absolutely no complaints as far as the food or service was concerned.  However, we were totally grossed out and ready to puke when a roach came to pay us a visit in our booth.  The roach was moving really slowly, almost ready to die, which was great because that made it possible for our waitress to see it when we called her over.  The look on her face was one of pure disgust.  She apologized and walked over to the counter to tell another waitress.  At this point, we were all standing and ready to run out of there to take steaming hot baths!!!  No one came back over to the booth where we were standing at, so we walked to the front counter.  The main waitress told us that there was no bill due to the inconvenience.  No duh!!!  Ya think?!?!  I truly believe that when you see one roach, that means there is an infestation.  Especially when you have bold roaches that come out to dine with you.  I came onto Yelp to peruse the other reviews of this location to see if anyone else had any other unfortunate experiences with roaches.  I did a quick search of the reviews by typing \"roach\" into the review search engine, and sure enough three other reviews popped up with the same issue of roaches in their booth/table.  Shame on Blueberry Hill for allowing such filth.  There are no exceptions, and I will never, ever, ever step foot in this place again."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place.  The portions were HUGE and the price was fantastic.  I ate here twice while I stayed in Vegas.  I highly recommend the pancakes...so fluffy and delicious!"}
{"text":"Havnt been here for a meal in over 10-15 yrs. Came last night, sat down and could not believe how big the menu was... So much to choose from..waitress was absolutely friendly ...brought coffee. Made us feel very welcome ...food was sooo delicious. .. restraunt was really clean and staff was very professional. .1 adult and 2 kids and our whole bill was only 18.00 ..which was great ...we will definitely be going back. .. cant believe we forgot about this gem .. Such a great family restraunt.."}
{"text":"This is a very nice hole in the wall place. The plates are $9-$12 which seems like a lot but you get a ton of food. Still come every time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"They have many choices on the menu and reasonable prices.  The service was friendly and we were seated quickly even though they were busy.  The food was excellent and it was nice getting away from the strip."}
{"text":"Blueberry Hill was better than we expected. Seeing the menu online, then the exterior of the restaurant and knowing it was a 24 HR joint sort of lowered our expectations going into it. 24 hour restaurants are usually below average, but we felt this place was a great find.  We arrived around 11:30am on a Saturday and there was a short line up in front of us. We were seated fairly quickly and the staff was pleasant.  I ordered some sort of ground Angus beef steak topped with bacon and cheese, served with eggs (I got scrambled), hashed potatoes and a side of toast. My boyfriend ordered the Meat Lovers Omelacake served with hashed potatoes. Both plates were HUGE. Everything was tasty and we've both never really seen breakfast items like these anywhere else, so it was a treat to try something new and different. They have a pretty big menu and a few of the items are unique from other similar breakfast places.  I'm not sure how their dinner is, but the breakfast was delicious. My honey and I both agreed that the coffee was yummy as well! That's always a very important detail ;)  (*This place fell short of 5 stars for me only because I was brought brown toast instead of white toast the first time my food was served to me, small detail. The waitress brought me the white toast a couple minutes later and apologized for the mix up)"}
{"text":"I found this place by typing \"best breakfast\" in google maps. It was pretty close to the mark!"}
{"text":"This restaurant may look a little old from the outside but the inside is a whole new point of view. The staff is very kind and helpful, the three fresh fruit & compote crepes are delicious. The plain chicken and waffles are very good. I recommend this awesome restaurant if you and your family are looking for somewhere kid friendly in Las Vegas. I RECOMMEND THIS"}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp for always steering us in the right direction! This place was delicious, pancakes were some of the best I've ever had. Menu looked really good, hope we can come back for lunch sometime soon!"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast wifh my daughter. The food was Overpriced, food was mediocre a small milk cost more then a gallon of milk would cost at the grocery store... $3.09 for a glass of milk lol and $33 for breakfast for two"}
{"text":"I am from California and my visit was great! My mom, my sister and I all had pancakes and they were to die for!!! This place is amazing!!! I will try to make it back here every time I come back to Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"The greeting staff seemed nice but our waitress was rude.  She was going to charge twice for sharing a cup of coffee, wasn't helpful and seemed like she was sour about everything.  I raised this with the manager and she didn't seem phased by it as if were a normal and acceptable occurrence.   Anyway,  food and ambience is ok and nothing worth noting.  The service was terrible so this place isn't worth going to.  Save your money and go to other better breakfast places around the area."}
{"text":"Omlette was Awful and service was even worse. If you want a great breakfast spot don't come here"}
{"text":"This was a great place to eat away from the strip! The food was really good and priced well! My husband and I split a plate because they serve you so much. We def will eat here next trip!"}
{"text":"This is a bustling place fast friendly service very good food good price. We both had the huevos rancherous which was excellent. We asked for spicy and they sent out the home made hot sauce! Wow fab. It is served with homemade retried beans and a roasted jalipeno. The rest of the menu looks equally good with pancakes, skillets, etc... Will come back next we are in town."}
{"text":"If you love breakfast food like I do, then go here. You won't be disappointed!   My boyfriend and I love breakfast restaurants. We tried this place for the first time recently. We truly enjoyed eating here. I love the blueberry theme. The staff is so charming. Our waitress was very attentive, and they were slammed too.    The food.... Very delicious. We had scrambled eggs, bacon , sausage, pancakes and, of course, a blueberry muffin!  The menu is pretty big and they have a lot of variety.  The prices are very low and you get a ton of food!! I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Just your average breakfast diner type restaurant. I did really like their toast though it was very delicious. Our waitress was very friendly and kept our coffee refilled. Food was fine nothing extra spectacular tasting. Good portions. They sell cakes and cheesecakes sweets they looked very good."}
{"text":"Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day. And Blueberry Hill a local Vegas breakfast chain serves my favorite meal 24 hours day. Most of the items at Blueberry Hill are made from scratch, including there french toast, waffles, and pancakes. My favorite is the Stuffed French Toast, which is stuffed with cream cheese, topped with fruit compote and whipped. So what if its calorie count should make it breakfast, lunch and dinner, its just that good. Anyway, for those who are not into breakfast they also serve lunch and dinner items. Just be warned that going to a breakfast place and ordering a tuna melt sandwich, is like going to a Johnny Rockets and ordering a salad, don't expect it to be the greatest."}
{"text":"Thank you Violet for being the best waitress to us. Made out visit that much better. Food was excellent! She never let our coffee or water cups run dry. Everyone must have their pancakes, so so good! We will definitely make this a place to visit when we come to Vegas."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here Monday morning. No wait, great service. Food came fast and hot. Prices were reasonable. I recommend it."}
{"text":"hmmmmmm......I had a cheese omelet with hash browns, boring I know.  They do have a fairly good sized menu with alot of variety.  That is nice.  I really enjoyed my food.   My omelet was hot and fluffy and I really liked the way the hash browns were  shredded.    Location is fairly close to the strip and not so pricy so that is nice.   Do I have to go back?????  It doesn't stand out to me as an I have to go back place.   Service was friendly, quick, portion size was big.   Decor is terrible and could really use some updating.   It's just A-OK in my book, you won't be disappointed but you won't be overly thrilled either."}
{"text":"Received word that a buddy was in town and wanted to grab a bite to eat on Sunday morning.  Wanting to knock a bookmark off the list we drove to another location and they were closed.  BBHFR was in the immediate area and all the other BB Hills are always a solid eat spot.  The parking lot was packed (lot's of out of town plates) and I thought we might be in for a wait.  While this was sort of the case, the two of us waited for about eight minutes and then we had a table.  The place was slammed and I was not expecting much from the waitress but she took our orders quickly and did the best to keep up with keeping the coffee hot.  My Grubsteaker breakfast was great!  A slab of ground beef covered with cheese and bacon, served with two eggs and hash browns.  This particular BBH offers great service, great food for those that live in the area and for those looking to make the long trek across the desert."}
{"text":"One of my closest friends and I came here on his recommendation last year.  I looked this place up on here for the address and it's only 3 blocks away I thought about it again today and we are going to visit on our way out of Las Vegas tomorrow.  The breakfast here was great and I''l post a pic tomorrow. Good prices,clean, great breakfast choises"}
{"text":"This place was awful. The waiter was more interested in talking to his co-worker than attend to us, he asked us if we were ready to order but had failed to give us menus upon our arrival, food was horrible. Never will I recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"2016 still good accountable American food! 2009:  This is the Golden Nugget from Chicago but in Las Vegas.    Perfect menu for standard American food.  The place is super busy all the time and you can have any menu item 24/7.  The staff all seemed in a good mood."}
{"text":"Came here a few weeks ago as part of a date that didn't go too well at the end but during the time while I was having dinner on this date the service was just as good as I remembered the waitress was friendly and she refilled our drinks and checked on us to make sure that everything was okay and she even helped with the requests that we wanted. The food was good I got the French toast and the ham and cheese omelette with toast and hash browns the food was really delicious the hash browns especially they were fresh and really crispy just like I like them overall I enjoyed coming here again and outside of the bad date I still got that comfort relaxing diner feeling that I got the last time I came here overall this will still be one of my good to restaurants when I want to grab some breakfast lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Great chicken fried steak,  gravy and biscuits and awesome hash browns.   All the staff was super polite too. My food wasn't cooked right and my biscuit was missing and waitress was so nice it didn't matter.  She did everything to make it right! My daughter loved her cinnamon swirl pancakes. Husband got breaded breakfast steak with grilled onions and loved it."}
{"text":"Blueberry Hill is a Vegas staple- reliably tasty food in giant portions, available 24/7 from a family owned restaurant. I usually only frequent the location closest to my home, but I've been on the East side a lot for work and have popped in a couple of times.  Service is quick, food is out hot and fresh, and the menu is massive so there's something for everyone, for every meal, making it good for groups. They have a breakfast taco plate that is okay (I prefer it eggs only, without the meat) and their omelets are enough to serve as your only meal for the entire day. I don't come here regularly but it never disappoints."}
{"text":"A great cup of coffee! What kind of coffee is that?? Brand??? Anyone know??? If so help a girl out! Anyways, came here with family and really fell in love with the place. Such an old school dinner feel, the menu was a bit massive, but had great selections. My husband and I split the biscuits and gravy and a side of potato's. Everything was very good...if in the area check this cute place out!"}
{"text":"My friends and I came here to eat and the waitress shannon was very rude. she made us feel very uncomfortable. i had a terrible experience and i will never go there again. She was slamming our plates down and our food was squished from the way she was carrying it. One of us accidentally grabbed the wrong copy of the receipt and she chased us out of the restaurant causing a huge scene in front of other customers. You could tell it made everyone uncomfortable and could've been resolved in a better manner. NEVER EATING THERE AGAIN"}
{"text":"Is a very delicious but i had bad experience today , im alwalys visit that place mornings after 9 am but today i want to get my dinner there so i went around 8:00 pm , So i asked for a table and one of waitresse was cleaning the tables when told me \" ok use this table \" and my answer was : \" no thank u please can i have that table \" and she did bad face to me !! But i didnt matter me , but she made me feel bad !!!"}
{"text":"Blueberry Hill 24 hour diner in Vegas is located near the Super 8 motel, which is probably where it gets most of its business from since it is quite a ways away from the Strip. (Although it is close to Nelles Air Force base, which I guess might be another source). When I entered this establishment, it was midnight and I was a bit pissed off at my body for being in constant pain (my intestines are in rebellion) and at Vegas for being a jip (my girlfriend and I made the mistake of walking from the very far North of the Strip on down to the Stratosphere for the over-priced view, which means crusty old drunk dudes, strip clubs, cockroaches on the streets, and shotgun wedding chapel fun). In any case, this place offers somewhat of a haven of normalcy, even if it still has slots and the like.   The menu was extensive and the service decent. The vegetarian options were minimal, but of this I am not surprised in the least. The food arrived fast, ad the hash browns were good. Now why do I bring up the hash-browns first? Well that's because the rest of it was only so-so. Once again you show your true side Vegas: all show and no substance.  Ah well..the place was still a relief from $30 steak and shrimp buffets and card scams on the street."}
{"text":"This place has it all! Huge pancakes, waffles, 4 egg omelets, huge! Chicken fried steak, chicken fried chicken, biscuits and gravy, beef hash, eggs benedict, I could go on!  The atmosphere is nice, it's a step or two up from Denny's, but definitely large corporate scale'ish.  But it's still pleasant and quick.  We come here whenever we visit Vegas and it's become one of our favorite breakfast spots.  The servers are all very nice, we are usually sat quickly, and the food portions are so big, no one can ever finish, but the prices are all great, so....what's not to like?"}
{"text":"This place has the best breakfast! My husband ordered the blueberry and strawberry crepes (recommended by our knowledgable waitress), and I ordered the Texas chili omelet. They were both amazing! I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I'm a regular customer here and I've always had a wonderful experience here. Lisa, Leslie, and DeeDee are the best waitresses around!"}
{"text":"The Philly Cheesesteak Omelet breakfast I had was Awesome!  This is my favorite place to come to when I'm out to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"We are visiting from Hawaii and didn't want to deal with the crowds and lines on the strip.   Loved this placed.   Homemade cooking.   Everything was made from scratch.   They only use real butter.   The biscuits and gravy was amazing.   Huge chunks of sausage in the gravy.   I'll def be back."}
{"text":"Well considering we came in on a Sunday at around 10 A.M. you could tell we came at a busy time. However, the hostess sat us within 15 minutes without any problems! When the waiter came to take our order however, you can tell he was swamped with previous tables and tables about to be given to him. I'm not saying he was rude but a bit worked up.   I ordered the hot chocolate which is supposed to come with a cookie.. Sadly I didn't get the cookie. Maybe they ran out or he forget. Anyways I tried to brush that off. For breakfast I ordered the south of the border Benedict which I'm sorry to say was not very good. But according to my family members they said their plate was really good. So I guess it was a poor choice of selection on my part.   All in all I would have to say that my visit here was just okay. Although, I would like to go back to this restaurant and try something else off the menu. Maybe next time I will be a bit luckier in choosing a better selection."}
{"text":"Service is fast & efficient. These people know Breakfast. Eggs Florentine Benedict were great, not greasy. Eggs cooked perfectly. Pancakes were great-large, fluffy, not sweet. Side of fruit was very fresh and delicious. You can also get housemade salsa & cholula with your eggs if you'd like. I'd give it 5 star, but it's very noisy & busy. Better if you order on menu without changes. Serving sizes are generous. Pork sausage is links and not fatty at all. Very tasty.  I would definitely recommend this place for good breakfast."}
{"text":"Traditional diner. Excellent breakfast options. Delicious, well-plated. Loved it. Comfortable and relaxed."}
{"text":"Today, 7-18-2017, I visited this fine establishment to enjoy some of their delicious food.  When I walked in, I was immediately greeted with a beautiful smile and warm greeting by Claudia.  She made my day with that smile of hers.  I wanted a nice big chef's salad or antipasto salad, but neither was on the menu.  I opted for the vegetable omelet with egg whites, sliced tomatoes and whole wheat toast.  The food was great, as it always has been in my experience.  In fact, the only higher mark goes to the service I always receive here.  Linda continues to maintain a great team of servers.  So, food gets a Five Star rating, Service gets 6 stars.  Thank you all."}
{"text":"First time here today for breakfast.  So so goooood!  The chicken waffle was great..chicken moist tender and crispy, waffle fluffy and light.  Bertha waited on us and she was fantastic..very bubbly, friendly and oh so attentive.  This is now our go to place for breakfast. Can't wait to go back to try the pigs in a blanket or the cinnamon French toast.  This place has been around for a long time and now I know why!"}
{"text":"We were seated as soon as we walked in and waitress was at table within 2 min taking drink orders.   They were very busy so impressed.   Extensive menu.   Huge portions.   Way too much for a normal eating person.   I'm letters are 4 egg and served with hash browns and toast or French toast or pancakes.   I must say they struck out on 3 of my request.   No Diet Coke. No green tobacco  sauce and no peanut butter."}
{"text":"If you want the best blueberry pancakes on the planet, this terrific family restaurant is the place to come.  Their menu is extensive.  I had the Little Boy Blue on the server's recommendation, which came with hot, fluffy scrambled eggs, sausages, and two of the aforementioned pancakes.  The pancakes themselves were chock full of fresh blueberries, and there was warm blueberry compote in between layers and ladled on top, served with whipped cream.  Service was fast and friendly, and the prices reasonable.  This is a gem that I am sure is beloved by locals, and will now become a favorite of this out-of-town visitor as well."}
{"text":"Very good breakfast and service.  I been eating here since 2000 and definitly enjoy the breakfast menu over the lunch/dinner menu, but that is me."}
{"text":"My brother and I ate at Blueberry Hill on a cross-country trip way back in 1991. I'd long since forgotten the name, but I remembered the pancakes. When my family visited Vegas last week, I saw Blueberry Hill's high Yelp rating and knew it must be the place. I was right!   What a welcome break from the strip for us after a few days of casino restaurants! The pancakes were what I remembered. Fluffy, with that very slight crispness on the outside, just perfect. We all enjoyed them!  For some reason, I ordered a mushroom and cheese omelet, and this was the only bad part of the meal. Overall it promised to be an acceptable, not great, dish -- but a few bites in I realized that some of the mushroom pieces were spoiled. I had to spit it out into a napkin -- gross. I was so full from the pancakes by then, that I decided to just leave it be instead of sending it back for something else.  I'd come back here for the pancakes any time I'm in town, but wouldn't stray into the omelet territory next time."}
{"text":"Loved Blueberry Hill!! I was in town for a competition and Blueberry Hill was across the street. Decided to check it out. Very very impressed. Food was OUTSTANDING, large portions, very clean place, customer service and wait staff were both good too. I ate here twice in a 5 day period and both times were the exact same with all gave food. Good Job Blueberry Hill / I'll definitely be back next time I'm in town"}
{"text":"Excellent service! Daisy was a wonderful waitress,  and the food was excellent. Great spot to eat away from the smoky casinos. Reasonable prices, good coffee."}
{"text":"We were visiting Las Vegas and my husband recommended this place he had eaten at before, off the strip.  We are pretty healthy eaters and stay away from buffets due to the enormous selection and hefty price tags associated with buffets.  My husband and I opted for the egg-white omelet and my son ordered a half order of the oreo pancakes.  Shame on me for not asking about portion size, but when the plates arrived, it was enough to feed 6 people, not 3.  I even told the waitress, I wish you would have informed us about the portion size because I will not be able to eat 1/2 of my plate.  She delightfully said we could take it home in a to go box, which I'm sure most of their patrons are from out of town, so I wouldn't be surprised if they don't tell people hoping to increase their check total. I was stuffed at 1/2 the plate and was forcing myself to eat a little more because I hated that it would go to waste. The omelets were fine, nothing special, the hashbrown side was not very tasty, and those were left untouched on the plate.  My son enjoyed his oreo pancakes, and even with a 1/2 order of 2 pancakes, there was still 1 and 1/4 pancakes on his plate.  Ii have to add the highlight of the meal was the sourdough toast!  Absolutely, phenomenal!  There were 4 pieces between the 3 of us, and we all wanted more.  So, the bill comes and it is a whopping $38 for 2 adults and a child.  We would have been better off eating at a buffet!  The food was decent, but if I were to go back, I'm splitting an order with someone!"}
{"text":"It was decent, I think the prices for breakfast were a bit steep but overall we were satisfied with our choices. The place is quite old-timey so we felt too young being there, lol but if I had an option to return, I'll probably try somewhere else. The service was nice and the portions were more than enough, give them a try for a true down home diner experience."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast and coffee to die for    waffles that melt in your mouth. Fast service and great food."}
{"text":"After a long night out in Vegas, we decided we need some GOOD breakfast (off the strip, preferably). The valet guy at The Flamingo recommended us to his local breakfast diner, saying that it was really good! Just a few short miles from the hotel, we ran across a huge blue sign for the restaurant. Indeed, the restaurant was filled with locals. The prices were much more reasonable than those at restaurants on The Strip, and yes, the food was quite good! I ordered the Mexican Chilaquiles, and the flavors were fantastic! A heap of eggs sat atop cheese and homemade chips, with a side of Mexican rice, beans, lettuce, and sour cream. The dish was accompanied by a spicy sauce as well, which definitely heated up the dish! Great food, overall."}
{"text":"Good for a diner spot. First time here. I sat at the bar area and just watched how a manager reached, spoke over and scratched over food that's waiting in the window. Good job pushing it out but poor restaurant health behaviors. Kinda don't like plates stacked on top of my food either. *****for God sake, hair nets or pull your hair back!****"}
{"text":"THE MOST AMAZING PANCAKES I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE! It was after 4pm and I was craving pancakes and stumbled upon this little hidden gem. Service is great and I enjoyed every minute of my experience. Def check it out! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Breakfast for dinner?  Why not!!  Blueberry Hill Family Restaurant (BHFR) makes this possible.  A Vegas staple it's much more wholesome than the other corporate b-fast locations scattered throughout the valley.  Our wonderful server was super friendly and made sure the coffee mugs never ran empty.  I ordered up eggs, bacon, hash browns (extra crispy), sourdough toast.  The mood would see that I would also order a carb laden grilled blueberry muffin.  Breakfast and coffee were up to the BHFR standard.  The muffin.....I recommended everyone try this.  It was incredible!"}
{"text":"Such an awesome restaurant with many different options. Every time I am in town I try to go here and bring whoever I am with there. It is an absolute must stop. Be prepared to wait but it is worth it!  I am a huge fan of their pancakes!"}
{"text":"Wanted a family style restaurant away from the lines and prices on the strip.  We had a car and this was just a few mile drive east on Flamingo Road.  Well worth it.  Fast, friendly service.  Excellent food.  My wife, me and two teenage girls all had a great breakfast and were set for our day.  Pancakes were awesome.  Portions generous."}
{"text":"Always a great stand by. Never disappointed here. The food is good and the service is excellent.  open 24 hours.  You can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  Had the oreo pancakes and the chicken fried chicken, good stuff.  Go here"}
{"text":"Love the location & liked the service during other visits. Tonight such a disappointment. Waitress was not interested in serving. She got one of our orders wrong, So everyone had their food while the other had to sit for original to be cooked. Came by to see if we needed refilled but disappeared before we got the drinks refilled. Each time we reminded her of something she forgot she replied, \" no worries\"..as if her mistakes were out fault. Less than 5 tables occupied when we arrived."}
{"text":"We were craving s yummy breakfast late at night, and We decided to come out and eat here! I had a very weird experience, as soon as I walked in, as courtesy I waved hi to a cook ( because he was looking at us) anyway he was a creep all night! Would not stop looking over at our table, it went from a hungry night to feeling uncomfortable the whole time we were there. That ruined it for us. Even after the moved over to another table to get out of his sight he still managed to peek over where we were. Our waiter came over 2 times, to bring us beverages and then to bring us the food.  Never had this type of experience with any other blueberry hill. Food is good but service ruined it at this location."}
{"text":"Yummy breakfast if you want to get off the strip!! Great house potatoes, love their pancakes and a good price for a good amount of food."}
{"text":"Our party came here on a recommendation and they were correct. This spot has a great selection of breakfast plates but it also offers many other options. I ended up ordering a grilled cheese sandwich and it hit the spot after a long night on the town. The Alaskan waffle was a favorite with my party as well. There was a bit of a wait but once seated, the customer service was on point. Overall, highly recommend this restaurant if you want a satisfying breakfast!"}
{"text":"I have had many meals here over the years and sampled many an item off the menu.  It is true that breakfast at BBH is great.  I would rate it a four star no doubt.  Today I hopped in for lunch with the GF.  I went with the chicken salad sandwich and she went with the chicken breast salad.  My sandwich was pretty dry..my bad for not requesting the bread to be toasted.  The GF had to surgically slice off bits of cold chicken fat from the chicken breast.  It was painful to watch.  I kept asking her if she was alright to which she affirmed while continued to excise the meat.  The staff was friendly and she did not raise a ruckus.  By the end our table was quite messy with chicken breast parts and dry toast when we finished.  The staff is always friendly and breakfast is always delicious......I think I stick to eggs and pancakes next time."}
{"text":"OMG..... it wasn't busy, but it took forever to get service.... the waitress seemed pre occupied in herself,  completely un- attentive,   it was dark and dank inside, the bathrooms weren't clean, and  the food was horrible....  we ordered Spaghetti, and we asked the waitress to please put some extra sauce on the spaghetti.... she finally brings out the orders AFTER WAITING FOREVER and the spaghetti was naked.... not even enough sauce to even cover the meatballs....the spaghetti was OVER COOKED AND MUSHY....and after asking the waitress to please put extra sauce on our orders it came out with hardly NO SAUCE...So I had asked her if she remembered to put extra sauce on it.... she said yes, it has extra sauce.... I told her that it was almost no sauce....on our orders (then she said well we have to charge EXTRA for the sauce....(PLEASE?) I HAVE NEVER BEEN CHARGED FOR EXTRA SAUCE AT ANY RESTAURANT... not even when you order a pizza. Then we proceeded to eat the Spaghetti... and it was SO OVER COOKED....and MUSHY like mashed potatoes.... It was GROSS, TO SAY THE LEAST.... I don't recommend this place to my worst enemy.  Actually I sent the spaghetti back and ordered another selection and that was GROSSS as well.  STRINGY MEAT...GRIZZLE,  TASTED LIKE I CRAP.  We're NOT EVER GOING BACK TO THIS PLACE !  Oh and also not once did the waitress come back to ask if we wanted our drinks refreshed..... Cashier with the dark hair the older lady was rude.....just horrible experience and therefore they have lost our business."}
{"text":"My husband & I were at the County Library & decided to go to Blue Berries for Super Bowl Dinner.  We both had the special.  I had Turkey Dinner & my husband had ItalIian Meat Loaf Dinner.  This was about 4 PM.  By Midnight both of us were violently ill with food poisoning.  This carried over into Monday.  We are both furious.  We usually go to the Blue Berries off of Sandhill & have never had any issues.  I was hoping to take lunch break from my studies at the library next door, but will never go to this restaurant again.  Shame on you people!"}
{"text":"The food at the Blue Berry Hill Sand Hill/E Flamingo is always outstanding.  When management heard that we had Food Poisoning at another Blue Berries Restaurant in Las Vegas & were violently ill, they offered to pay for our breakfast as compensation.  The Blue Berry Hill Sandhill/E Flamingo restaurant has been our family restaurant for many years.  The food is consistently good, & the restaurant is always clean, & well managed.  We have never been sick!  Today's breakfast was outstanding.  They have a friendly & caring staff who always demonstrate outstanding customer service.  Thank you Blue Berries - Sandhill for taking such good care of us.  Hopefully, the other Vegas Blue Berries will use you as a role model."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time, and it was delicious. This will definitely be a spot to eat when we are in town.  Our waitress Raven was excellent!!!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed this place the food was really good and my kids actually ate their food. We got the Monte cristo sandwich super yummy!! And we got the Irish eggs Benedict was ok a little bland but still good, the kids got pancakes and French toast with eggs and bacon. My oldest demolished the chocolate chip pancakes and we all shared the huge biscuits and gravy. Over all really good food and nice people I will be back"}
{"text":"Awesome Omelets and the best coffee in town! The burgers are perfect and the staff is always nice and helpful. Old time rock and roll quietly plays in the background for a great old town dining experience."}
{"text":"Talk about stuffed!!! This place has delicious food! I ordered the breakfast meatloaf with eggs, potatoes and pancakes, I shared with my daughter and still have left overs.. everything was so flavorful, the service was great everyone was extremely friendly and attentive. We will definitely be back, my server was a young lady with a beautiful accent and was so nice. Thank you for making us feel so welcomed"}
{"text":"I really liked this place.  So much so that on a recent weeklong visit to Las Vegas, I ate here three times.  It's a chill spot serving up basic diner fare but keeping it a notch above the IHOPs and Denny's of the world.  Remember the end of Pulp Fiction (or middle) where Vincent and Jules are having breakfast at that diner that gets robbed.  Well, this is sorta that place minus the robbery.  Also, lots of big windows make the place much brighter than Tarantino's joint.  The first morning I had blueberry pancakes.  They're served three to an order and topped with blueberries, blueberry syrup and a dollop of whipped cream.  I asked the waitress if they came in a short stack because I didn't think I would finish them all.  She said no one does (finish them).  The verdict: excellent.    What really contributed to my liking of this place is the fact that it's a 'family restaurant'.  I was watching my three kids during the day while their mom attended conferences and it was no problem getting two of the rugrats into a booth while the other one was next to me in a car seat (she's only two months old).    Nobody was pissed that I had kids there.  A majority of the people were older, 50s or 60s.  It was a pleasant vibe for my family to enjoy breakfast.    It says it's open 24 hrs but I never got in beyond noon.  Buy my son was able to order spaghetti from the kids meal at 9am which was hella cool because he's not really into breakfast.    Everything was good which can be expected.  It wasn't tremendous or knock your socks off or high-end.  It was good which is what you expect when you go out for breakfast."}
{"text":"Service:  -Great attitude from the server, connected with her customers.  -quick service  -happy employees   Drinks: -Bland house coffee -iced coffee was served in an unappetizing blue plastic cup. The taste lacked richness and could have been a simple coffee with creamer. Yet, charged $2.89   food: -bonanza special (two eggs, bacon, and pancakes\"     --over cooked, extremely salty, burnt bacon.     --pancakes (IHOP or Dennys pancakes beat this place)     enough said.   -Meat lovers special     --Had more potatoes than actual meat. Denny's beats this, once again.    -Dixi's special     --lacked flavor. Not really meatloaf, just fried bread crumbS.   Overall, disappointed :( We expected more from this mom and pop diner. #goodbye"}
{"text":"My mom rocks. Besides being awesome on many different counts, she introduced Blueberry Hill to me. Now, she's not a foodie, but she knows good breakfast grub.   She's no urban adventurer either, so I was surprised to see that she left the Strip to find a new breakfast spot. One of the things I love and hate about Vegas are the plethora of eateries in your hotel, forcing you to stay in. But a favorite pastime of mine now is to venture from the Strip to find the local favorites.    I think I struck gold with Blueberry Hill. Everything, and I mean everything I've ever had here has been mouthwatering, hangover-curing, delicious.  Whether it's savory or sweet - it's ALL good here. I usually go for the Dealer's Special with a hamsteak and hash browns, but another good option is any number of the Mexican breakfasts with chorizo.  Even the breakfast burrito was impressive. Their signature blueberry pancakes do not disappoint either.  It's unassuming with its dumpy naughahyde booth diner look.  But that's why it's even more of a surprise find.  You can easily eat here for under $10.    Btw, there's a location just east of Maryland Parkway that's closer to the Strip."}
{"text":"Great everything! You can always judge how good a breakfast is going to be by how fresh the OJ is. The OJ here is fresh squeezed. I could have had three glasses! Enough said."}
{"text":"Brother-in-law really hyped this place up and I wasn't impressed.  The six of us were squeezed into a corner booth leaving us absolutely no room to get comfortable.  Breakfast was mediocre at best.  Hubby ordered an omelet which was obscenely large.  I had a skillet and asked for no potatoes or tortilla chips (chips - really?) - well it came w/ chips so I picked them out.  Even with chorizo in the dish it was really bland.  Everyone else seemed to enjoy their meal but since I'm the reviewer - I give it 2 starts."}
{"text":"Wonderful establishment. Very family oriented. Food was decent. It was warm not cold but nothing to complain about.  The bathrooms were filthy so it kind of set the tone about other areas. We unfortunately had already ordered. Nothing more to really add. It isnt a place i would recommend."}
{"text":"They say their pancakes and desserts are made from scratch so that's always a plus in my book . My table ordered eggs & sausage , pancakes, and omelettes. The food has a bit of a southern style to it . At the end of our breakfast the cashier made it very obvious that she was bothered. We gave her a 20 dollar bill and a card hoping she'd take the cash then put the rest in the card. It's not that hard , I was a cashier at multiple places before so I know it's not that much of a difficult task. Would've given a better rating if it wasn't for this bitter lady at the counter."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food.   Brought my family of five here for breakfast and got a varied group of dishes. Everything we got was good, I mean really fantastic. We ate at a casino restaurant the night before and this place had ten times better food (and more of it) for literally half the price.   Don't know that you could go wrong here with any dish but would make a special point to tell anyone to try the all-fruit crepes. The cheese filling is lighter than most places and less sugary. It's awesome."}
{"text":"I stopped in there after a Sunday morning drive. I ordered the strawberry cream cheese stuffed french toast and a clear soda. The dish arrived about 15 minutes later. I was surprised that I got it so quickly due to being there during the Sunday morning breakfast rush.  I wish that I had my camera phone with me that morning so I could have showed you all what this food looked like. You know how when you open a fresh package of Philadelphia cream cheese it is a big luke warm block? That is what was sitting between my two slices of french toast. A giant block of luke warm cream cheese. No flavoring. Nothing. Just the block. The strawberry topping looked decent enough so I dug in thinking that it would taste better than it looked.  The strawberry topping was okay. Sweet and thick. The French Toast itself seemed a bit more like toaster toast but was cooked well. The block of cream cheese tasted just how it looked, a lukewarm block of cream cheese. I ate about half of the meal and couldn't take any more. I got my to-go tray, paid my bill and went on with my day.  How was the rest of my day you ask? After eating nothing else all day my night consisted of Food Poisoning. I lost my thrill and my breakfast at Blueberry Hill.  Food Poisoning, enough said.     ."}
{"text":"Another Dice adventure from about 2 weeks ago.    Been busy and havent updated on time.     The Pros:   Clean.  Comfortable Fast service Huge menu with a lot of choices Cheap  The cons:  The worst chili I have ever eaten, I think chili is one thing everyone should order and to me that tells you right there if the restaurant is good or not, haha, I have had some bad chili but this was by far the worst.  My friend said his burger was OK but dry...My friend had biscuits and Gravy and she said it was different.     All in all, I wouldnt choose it again, well I didnt, our friend did but she wouldnt choose it again either  ;)  Maybe for breakfast?  Different cook may make that experience totally different and maybe a different Blueberry Hill."}
{"text":"Best place to get a huge breakfast omlet !  The food is great always."}
{"text":"Walking past this location on pretty much any given morning, it's apparent that this is a Las Vegas favorite. The packed parking lot and surrounding curb, a taxi dropping off a fare, cop cars, and the out-of-state plated cars remind me why this modest-looking joint is my choice breakfast locale.  The great: The food. It's that simple. My favorite single item is their french toast. 4 wedges and I'm in heaven (and full). I also enjoy their meatloaf and after a night of drinking, the (huge!) breakfast burrito is quite satisfying. The prices are reasonable too, and you generally get a lot of food for the money.   The not-so-great: I hate to say it, but the service is not as consistent as I'd like. Late night the servers are always super-attentive, but during the day is another story. It seems like it has little to do with how busy they are, as I've gone on a weekday mid-afternoon and the place is maybe 1/4 full and the service was worse than a visit on a bustling Sunday morning.   Still, there's a reason why people from all walks of life come in, it's quite the breakfast joint."}
{"text":"It took 45 minutes from when we walked in the door to get our food. It looked like they were in the middle of a shift change but it is not an excuse. We ordered the complete meal but it took our waitress another 20 minutes after asking if we were ready for dessert to come over for our order. We used to come here every week. No longer."}
{"text":"Had the apple compote chicken waffles at 6 am. Nice and empty and food was delish. Service was expert and fast. They are pros and it was like watching the donuts get pressed out at Krispy Kreme. Like clockwork. Happy to come back next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I did not find my thrill... on Blueberry Hill.     Always in search of a good breakfast place, Blueberry Hill was next up on the list to try.  We stopped early on a weekday.  Not busy at all so we were greeted and seated immediately.  We had good service.  She was very attentive with our needs.  My coffee never went dry and we were checked on frequently.    Our breakfasts weren't as good as the service.  I ordered the Potato Pancake Eggs Benedict.  I was really underwhelmed with it.  While the eggs were done perfectly, as a whole it was just bland.  The potato pancake resting beneath the egg was very plain.  I wish the potatoes had more of a seasoning cooked in.  The hollandaise was also a disappointment.  It could really use some sprucing in the flavor department.    My husband ordered the Chicken Fried Steak.  The look on his face told the story.  The steak was way overdone and dry.  The majority of his hash browns were really underdone.  I had to try them just to make sure he wasn't being picky.  But I believe he was right this time.    They really have an extensive menu so maybe I'll have to try one of their waffle or pancake creations. I'll just steer clear of the Benedict."}
{"text":"Great off the strip family restaurant recommended by a local resident.  Too much food, good to split.  Nancy, our waitress was a gem."}
{"text":"The food was awesome... the French toast and banana pancakes were some of the best I ever tasted. the service was good. It only got a minus star because the water tastes funky(like funky even to a girl that use to drink from the water hose on a nice sunny day) and the bathroom needs up keep. I would still come back again"}
{"text":"My family and I love this place! my husband, kids and I enjoyed breakfast almost all the weekends. The pancakes and Guadalajara skillet are the best!   Descent prices!!  Friendly staff!!   GOOD FOOD!!!"}
{"text":"Always a good spot to hit on the way home from a night of clubbing.  Service is always quick and with a smile."}
{"text":"The food was alright..nothing to be cosidered the \"best in las Vegas\". No way! The waitress i useually have was being yelled at by her boss in the dining room. As a manager of a local establishment i have never harassed my employees infront of our guests. Thats embarrassing...it was a site worthy of a lawsuit in my opinion. The waitress that was being hostily treated seemd to keep hercool inspite of the boss' attacks..i commend her for that. I hope things change so i can return and not witness this poor display of leadership. I just wanted good service is that too much to ask for?"}
{"text":"Was looking for a good breakfast place and stumbled across this place. I called ahead to see what the wait was and I was told 10 minutes. As soon as we arrived everything was packed starting from the parking lot all the way inside. We were still seated as soon as we walked in. The food was awesome and came quick. Our server Violeta was also very good! Totally recommend this place."}
{"text":"Excellent place for a family or if you are by yourself! Reasonable prices and excellent food.  -Clean -Friendly staff -Very quick service  -Wonderful food.  Stopped there on the way out of Vegas on a friend's recommendation and we were not disappointed!  I had the smoked sausage omelette and it came out in a flash even though they were pretty crowded.  Kids menu covers just about everything and the portions are very good sized for kids, surprisingly.   Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Me my wife and our friend stopped by, the menu was clear and looks very delicious we ordered 3 meals ( meatloaf - chicken steak - beaf steak) after less than 10 min we got our food on our table, that was so fast.  Staff was very friendly and easy to talk to, food was great prices are reasonable and affordable."}
{"text":"Our first stop as soon as we landed .. The food is excellent! The pancakes filled me up before I could even think to finish anything else... The service was a little slow but the manager on duty jumped right in & made sure that we were taken care of."}
{"text":"My wife and I were introduced to this eatery by our good friends, while visiting Las Vegas to celebrate our eighteenth wedding anniversary. After enjoying a bit of the Las Vegas nightlife, our companions suggested we get some early morning grub at one of their dining spots. Immediately after we devoured our meal, my wife and I responded in unison, \"why hadn't they told us about this place before!\" This place was so good, we ate there again the following morning! The food was delicious, the prices were cheap, and the service was awesome! If you dine here during or after the bewitching hour, ask to be served by \"Cornbread.\" This guy was amazing...he will definitely take care of you. Entree suggestions: anything and everything on their menu! If you can't find something you'd like at this place, then you possess a lack of taste buds. Open 24/7, with daily specials and a wide assortment of delectable delights to choose from, I highly recommend Blueberry Hill Restaurant Bar and Bakery!"}
{"text":"The prices are fair and the quality and quality of food is good.  You won't walk away hungry.  The food has really good flavor and the proportions were huge.  The wait was only 5 mins and the service was quick.  They are open 24/7 which is nice.  I recommend this restaurant for breakfast."}
{"text":"We were seated quickly for a party of 6, Eggs Benedict was great, staff is friendly, avocado is $2.75, coffee is expensive about $3.00. Pricey for the food, but it's great for a quick breakfast."}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant! Quesadillas are soooo good... Pancakes on point!!!! Good quality REAL food."}
{"text":"I first hit this place months ago with two of my brothers, it was declared a must stop and eat place that day. Servings are super sized and plenty tasty. This last time I went it was just Kim and I. I changed my order last minute as the waitress showed up and went for the \"OMLLECAKE\". There is a pic of it that someone posted on here already. I could not finish the beast, but what a delicious challenge. A four egg omlette with whatever trimmings you want wrapped in a giant pancake. MMM good, and I am usually a savory not sweet breakfast person. I may never attempt the Omllecake again, but that is only because they have a huge menu and I am eager to try it all. Also, I can only speak for this location, I have passed by the others, but only eaten at this one."}
{"text":"Lisa is the best! Had the chicken tenders dinner, comes w/ drink, salad or soup AND dessert! Their salad dressings are very tangy and tasty, at least the french and the honey mustard are. Their breakfast menu looks amazing, we will be back! Wide variety of different entrees, I will try their honey coconut chicken soon, looks yummy."}
{"text":"This is an old breakfast spot when I lived in Vegas full time. Still as good as before and that was ten years ago. Great place then great place now.   Food is excellent. Made with care and all the flavor you should expect.   The manager frequently walks around and speaks with the guests, keeping the highest of quality service.   The service staff are friendly and fast.   Bottom line great place for a quick delicious meal. Breakfast, lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Lived here for 7 years and been meaning to check this place out. Went on Wednesday AM, seated right away. Waitress was great transplanted New Yorker.. Only complaint was the blueberry muffin while large was scarce on the berries. Other than that, had eggs, ham and hashbrowns which were tasty. Coffee was good. Tasted some different than the water served most places. Service was excellent!"}
{"text":"You know the place is good when we decided to come here three days in a row for breakfast. It's the classic diner breakfast with great food and friendly service. Had the chicken and waffles one morning. The waffle was top notcha nd the chicken was tasty."}
{"text":"Decent diner-style food: large portions, small prices, not much in the way of healthy options. Be extra careful ordering takeout, they take your card number (who knows how safe it is) and may or may not actually make your order correctly despite ringing you up and charging you correctly.  I'm not a fan of breakfast foods but they have a lot of diversity here: crepes, eggs, pancakes, waffles, omelets, and skillets galore. Add in lunch and dinner salads, sandwiches, wraps, burgers, soups, and entrees. They recently added appetizers, also priced surprisingly well: 12 boneless wings for $6, onion rings $4, etc.  Staff is mostly friendly here: they almost seem overstaffed when I go with multiple people behind the counter but only a few taking tables. Waitresses are amazingly sweet and will probably call you some variation of hon or honey throughout your visit.  Meatloaf is surprisingly good, chili tastes canned and gross, salads are surprisingly large and fresh, daily dinner specials are generally a good value."}
{"text":"They are alway nice to us my mom and me.its nice I get the  same waitress  every time and the food is real real good .love it the dinning room is always clean every thing about it is great.keep it up great job"}
{"text":"Just arrived to Vegas from Hawaii for vacation and this was our first place on our list of places to eat. We were seated quickly and food and beverages arrived promptly.  I had the waffles and it was cooked well. Nice and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  Service here was excellent and I want to make a shoutout to our server, Susie who was so friendly and attentive!!  She even gave us a blueberry muffin to go with our meal but unfortunately we were too full to eat it there (the food here is really good!). If I'm ever back in Vegas, I will definitely come back or at least recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"Great diner that has good food. I had the blueberry skillet with a small side of fruit. The soft drinks were kind of icky and the bathrooms could be a lot cleaner. I went around 11am on a Saturday morning so expect at least a 15 minute wait and for it to be super busy. I will be back to try some of their waffles though."}
{"text":"This is my 3rd time here and by far the best according to breakfast. I ordered the corned beef hash with eggs over easy and pancakes. I had blueberry compote added to the pancakes and so glad I did. Everything tasted good and the wait for food on this busy Friday morning was very reasonable. Took a slice of pina colada cake home and it's big enough for 2 people. Very flavorful and the cake texture was very moist. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I come here all the time with my boys and this morning my family. I'm happy to bring them here for the first time, because the service and food is excellent, even late at night!!"}
{"text":"I love breakfast. Even more, I love breakfast here. I first got introduced to Blueberry Hill when I spent quite a few weeks working on a show in Vegas a few years ago. One of the locals I was working with took me there. Every time I visit Vegas, I have to eat breakfast here. I would walk the several miles from the Strip if I have to. Everything is so yummy, and I always eat way too much and then feel sick. But in a good way. This is the way a diner is supposed to be. The coffee is strong. The waitresses are career, and have been working here forever. The only thing I see as a negative is the bathroom. I feel dirty after I go in there, so only 4 stars (for now!)"}
{"text":"The service was great the women who waited on me was from Queens NY. She made me feel at home. I ate the steak and eggs and it was great very tasty."}
{"text":"Great Breakfast, and better Mexican dishes. An old fashion diner with great service and friendly waitresses."}
{"text":"A little gem away from the hustle and traffic of the Vegas Strip. Waffles are absolutely a must. Their regular pancakes were sensational a well even without the syrup. We went at 10am and did not have to wait. Great service and breakfast."}
{"text":"Let me get this straight. I LOVE BLUEBERRY HILL RESTAURANT. I just detest THIS one. After coming in at around 4 am with a small group of friends after a night out it became the last time I step foot at this particular location. The waitress was EXTREMELY rude. We never got refills on any of our drinks. The food was ok at best. Thank goodness there are other locations because I love the Chicken Fried Steak Breakfast. It's not the cleanest either. There is always something sticky somewhere! Being the only patrons in the restaurant at that time you would think we wouldn't be ignored so blatantly."}
{"text":"Blueberry Hill serves up completely average diner food.  It has it's purpose, though, and it makes great late-night or hangover food.  My chorizo \"omelet\" came out as more of a scramble, and only tasted \"OK\".  If you're looking for a local, family-owned alternative to IHOP that's still open 24 hours, this is your place.  It's a strange little restaurant, layout-wise, but on the plus side, they do have booths for odd numbered groups of 3, 5, etc...  The service was honestly just bad.  We rotated between 2 different waiters, and neither of them really paid us much attention.  To top off the misery, the guy at the cash register was one of the most pessimistic people I've encountered.  When my friend's credit card wouldn't swipe on the first try, he grumbled, \"At lest you *have* credit... Most people in the country don't!\"  Nice...  Blueberry Hill will serve in a pinch, but there have got to be better local 24 hour food options in Vegas..."}
{"text":"This place was really good  Family diner feel, I had the waffle which was the right amount of crunch and soft. The flavor was really good. Eggs cooked to order and the ham was big and delicious. Fast and friendly service and the price is pretty good especially since the plates are so big"}
{"text":"I decided to come here for breakfast after seeing the photos of their pancakes. It should be noted that one order comes with five cakes. We were staying at an Airbnb, so I knew I could box the leftovers.   We walked in on a busy Saturday morning around 10:00. The wait time was a short 5-10 minutes.   I was hoping to see pumpkin on the menu, since it was October, but no dice. I was just about to settle for blueberry, but that idea was abandoned when I spotted the cinnamon roll pancakes. Cinnamon roll batter baked inside the pancakes with a thick drizzle of icing. The pancakes were even better than I had expected. I'm not a huge cinnamon fan to begin with, but the pancakes were amazing. The cinnamon sugar was caramelized on one side, giving the fluffy cakes a perfect crusty texture. The cinnamon topping, along with the icing drizzle and whipped cream, left no need for syrup.   My boyfriend allowed me to snag a potato from his skillet dish. Deep fried, crispy little nuggets were the perfect vehicle for sopping up the yolk from his over easy eggs.  Our server was busy, but attentive and never let our coffee mugs reach empty. When I asked for a to-go box, she came back with plastic forks and a side of syrup (I love an intuitive server)"}
{"text":"First time here, walked in and was greeted and seated immediately. Food was great and prepared fast. I went with the coconut chicken waffles. Delicious. I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I had the BEST breakfast at this place. The portions are huge so you might want to share with someone.  Hubby got their famous blueberry pancakes while I got a corn beef hash omelet. My omelet was good but the blueberry pancakes are FREAKIN DELICIOUS!! Typically I don't like sweet stuff for breakfast but man those pancakes were good. I kept asking for more! The pancakes are thick and fluffy with blueberries baked right into them. Topped them off with whipped cream-man, it was heaven.  I got sour dough bread as the bread-of-choice with my omelet. My pet peeve is that the sour dough breads are never sour enough. Theirs was good; just sour enough.  This is going to be my go-to breakfast place whenever I go to Vegas from now on."}
{"text":"skip breakfast on the strip.  skip waiting over an hour for some buffet.  just come here and get friendly fast service and great food.  the cinnamon toast pancakes are out of this world.  and don't even get me started on the insanely thick, extra crispy bacon. yummmmmmmmmmm!  i drooling just remembering this place."}
{"text":"We came as a group for the second week on a row.  They seated us together near the back of the place, ideal so we could chat as we usually do Victoria was a super server. She and the rest of the staff got all our orders out promptly hot and delicious. She even boxed our desserts individually. With a good sampling of their dinners and some breakfasts, I know why this local chain of restaurants gets high praise as some of the \"Best ofVegas.\""}
{"text":"I had to leave another review. My mom was in town visiting from cali and we coukdnt wait to bring her to our neighborhood Blueberry Hill. She ordered the enchiladas my daughter ordered spaghetti and we shared chicken fajitas. our server was amazing as usual. When the food came out I thought we were being pranked since it was April Fools. The enchiladas were okay every dish we got needed salt cuz the food was Bland. My daughter spaghetti sauce was separating from the noodles something I've never seen before but luckily she's not too picky so she still ate it. Are chicken fajitas were ridiculous we had maybe a half-dozen small strips of chicken, not even a half of one bell pepper, and maybe a quarter of onion. There was more plate than there was food. We told our server Sherry and she said yes she thought it looked bad when she got it too and took it right back and told them that we needed more food especially for $15. I guess the cooks told her they needed to charge us for it which is ridiculous. we will not be coming back to Blueberry Hill again. I'm so disappointed that a business that runs so bad and has double charge just before and another time brought us the wrong food and this time charged us and not give us enough food is still in business. I swear this service is the only thing keeping this business open. Sherry is the best server this business has and would definitely close down if it was not for her. you guys lost five valuable customers and we always tip well."}
{"text":"Ordered the French toast combo #1 and it waa excellent.   Exactly what I wanted. Everything was perfect and fresh."}
{"text":"Gargantuan proportions, excellent service.  Huge pancakes, great omelets.   Really should be $$, 2 people added up to 27$ for 2 entrees and 1 coffee"}
{"text":"Every neighborhood should have one.Love the 24 hr operation,  they are  there when you need them. We sit with Linda who is there in the am.However, if your wasted after a Saturday night of partying,  go get a waffle to cure what ails you.The never ending cups of coffee always help."}
{"text":"Normally when I come here I have a bunch of issues. My favorite item is the \"ole\" taco salad but I switch the chicken for beef. 90% of the time they tell me I can't switch it. And they sometimes throw random things in the salad like orange slices or lemon slices and that's just strange. But tonight our waitress Margarita was amazing! She didn't hassle us like other waiters and waitresses do, she stopped by frequently enough to refill our drinks (instead of the two refills I normally get there). I was able to get chicken in the salad this time without a hassle, she was super nice and friendly too!! I will definitely return but only order the taco salad if she's here so I can avoid conflict. This is one of my mine and my husband's favorite places to go, this was the best visit by far!!!!"}
{"text":"Great diner for that hangover breakfast! They had pie that looked amazing but we were too stuffed to try any!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat I highly recommend it's a little off strip but worth the drive cause of the large menu choices. Come and get it guys! I'm from California and this is like Denny's times 10."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! The prices are reasonable even though they are always busy they get you in and serve you pretty quick. The breakfast items are vast and so far every one I've come with enjoyed it. If your just in town for a few days this joint is worth the drive."}
{"text":"I thought this was a little family owned place but later find out it's part of a chain.  Oh well, it wouldn't have changed my rating but may have swayed me not to go at all.  The food is okay.  They are generous with the portions.  My problem was I kept expecting to be wowed.  I may have to go back and give it one more chance.  I had expected more since a co-worker raved about it.  But discovering people's tastes can help you better gauge their understanding of what tastes good.  Lesson learned.  Overall, it's a good sized restaurant with a friendly staff is nice.  Good price for so-so food. But you can probably find better.  homemade yelp anybody?"}
{"text":"A friend of mine recommended this place on the day I left Las Vegas for breakfast.  I didn't know what to expect, but I decided to just go with the flow.  Blueberry Hill was better than I thought.  Not knowing what this place was, I just thought it was just another eatery.  After parking the car and entering the establishment, I entered the restaurant and was pleasantly surprised.  We arrived on a Monday at 9am and the place was alive with energy.  Glad I didn't eat breakfast at a major hotel / casino, since they would have been quite pricey.  The neighborhood diner would do just fine, and that is what Blueberry Hill is.    I can compare this place to IHOP or Denny's, but this place is kinda different, but similar in alot of respects.  Its a decent place with nice people, at least when I was there.  I got the corned beef hash with 2 eggs and hasbrowns with sourdough toast.  And coffee.  Pretty tasty for $8. Service was good, although sometimes slow."}
{"text":"Skip Denny's and IHOP .Hidden Jem!!! Passed by probably 100 times never thought I would end up in one. HANDS DOWN THE BEST PANCAKES I HAVE EVER HAD. EVER!!!! I don't know if it's the fluffiness or what but I'm never disappointed plus the butter is real that's a plus. I get the same thing chicken country cried steak with the house special biscuits and gravy with Pancakes to replace the hash browns. I love the serving sizes are big not stingy with their food.  Never fails!!!!I've been 5 times in 2 months."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this gem while looking for some breakfast.  So happy we did! Great menu selections, fast seating even on a busy Saturday morning, and food was delivered much faster than expected. Courteous waitress who brought us tortillas upon request (not part of the chorizo omelette see ordered). Very good food, excellent value for the money.  Eat here!"}
{"text":"Been eating her for years and in every visit, I can go through the menu and end up ordering the same  (for Breakfast). Have had Green Chilaquiles and they are awesome!! Sandwiches are good! Portions are excellent for the price! OVERALL an A rating!!"}
{"text":"Well this used to be one of my favorite places to eat. Used to go there 4 or 5 times a week for dinner. Food was pretty good and our waitress was always great. But after tonight I will be looking for another place. Today they had their new menus. Well I must say I am no longer impressed. They have basically dropped off several items from the menu. The daily specials are no longer listed. Every item made with a Hoagie roll is gone. The chicken salad sandwich is gone. Several of the burgers ... My favorite omelette is no longer available, that was the Philly Cheese Steak Omelette. Oh and yes the prices on most items have also gone up. Just a plain Waffle is now $8.99!!! Really??  Not such a great deal any longer time to move on. Boulder Station Cafe isn't bad."}
{"text":"Blueberry hill is really good! My husband and I always go for breakfast when we're visiting Las Vegas because it's off strip and affordable! Try it out! I would call and get in their wait list if it's during brunch and in the weekend."}
{"text":"Seen a couple of these restaurants while driving around town and finally had the urge to have breakfast here.  Came on a Sunday Morning and noticed people constantly coming in and out. We walked inside and the place had many tables and looked to be remodeled and updated. Nearly all the tables were occupied but we managed to find a spot within 5 minutes.   Decisions.. Decisions:  Bonanza Special: 2 XL eggs, 2 strips of bacon and added 2 sausage links and went with 2 Buttermilk pancakes.  - (My girls order): She thought it was good and expected but the pancake was wonderful! (The other was mine). It only took one small bite for me to realize that the pancake was PERFECT! Homemade from Scratch for decades and made with Tender Loving Care (TLC)!  Sweet Waffle: ..\"made from our homemade waffle batter with four secret ingredients.\" (new recipe).   - We experimented on this one and it wasn't that good. It wasn't super sweet but had a decent flavor. Waffle had a rubbery texture that wasn't appealing. Stick with the pancakes!  Corned Beef Hash Omellete: corned beef hash with tomatoes, onions, green peppers and chunky breakfast potatoes. I also chose to have hashbrowns with white toast to accompany it.  - Shredded corned beef along with all the \"south of the border\" additions made it a Great dish. Not to mention filling.  Service was attentive and helpful, Pancakes were far better than any 'chain diner'  pancake I've ever had, Prices were okay and atmosphere wasn't bad."}
{"text":"Thanks for the good service.  I'm greatly disappointed with the sirloin I ordered. The menu claimed that the beef was certified Angus. It had to much fat and it was hard to cut. I've had a better steak at norms.      On a positive note, I enjoyed the pancakes and other breakfast items. I would return but not for the steak."}
{"text":"Very good place for breakfast and lunch. The orders are huge so keep that in mind. I love the option of having pancakes as a side for my omelette. Very nice ambiance and good comfort food. I had the Wild West omelette with pancakes and my son had the Denver omelette with home fries and toast."}
{"text":"Blueberry Hill was the place to eat years ago with great food. This place claims to be a Christian base organization with several locations but does not believe in giving back to the community and when you are blessed give back. Owner I have seen several times scream at his girlfriend, not the base family place they claim. Wonderful places like The Olmet House's even Denny's is a step up. The place is only good as its owner."}
{"text":"Really great service! Their breakfast food is what this place is all about. Their lunch and dinner options aren't as good. Their biscuits are kinda dry also, but that's what the gravy is for. Portions are big. Like I've mentioned, I just love their whole breakfast menu. Their cakes are also pretty good. Their staff is all also very, very nice. I think this is a Christian establishment connected to the Christian bookstore next door. Very warm, inviting environment."}

{"text":"Breakfast is definately my favorite meal of the day.  That being said, I can't believe that I have never been here in our 9 years in Las Vegas.  The coffee is perfect.  The pancakes are better than most.  I had a combo with crepes that were fricking yumm!  The blueberries didn't come out of a can!  I like the diner atmosphere and will make it a point to get here for breakfast more often!"}
{"text":"cool place nice service good food,  great prices"}
{"text":"Food is amazing the server was extremely nice & attentive. The food portion are huge filling & very delicious. So far this has been the best place I have eaten in Las Vegas! Definitely coming back again."}
{"text":"When they call you \"Hon\" as soon as you enter at 4:30 am you know you came to right place. Coffee was refilled regularly and the breakfast was $6.99.  Only downside was I asked for soft scrabbled eggs (they were overcooked and dry). I'd still go back."}
{"text":"Literally one of the best diners I have ever been to. If I could, I'd eat here every day and with that being said.. You could probably eat here every day for a while and not have the same thing twice. Great menu and great food!! Such a great local find. Especially having moved to Vegas from Brooklyn, NY!! We know diners. Now I wanna go and get their meatloaf...... You gotta try it!"}
{"text":"Best diner food I've had in Vegas!!! By far. It reminds me of being back home in Brooklyn. Typical diner feel with typical diner food but MAN!!! It's good!!!"}
{"text":"Great coffee that just keeps coming, pancakes are nice and fluffy and good flavor, we usually get omelettes that are huge and filling and come with a side of pancakes, great breakfast"}
{"text":"If you are preparing for a marathon, i suggest you don't visit this place for a while. Nobody eats heavy  in the middle of a marathon also but if this is in your route then just come back right after.  If you are not preparing for a marathon, i suggest you run 10 laps around the nearest park so you will be voraciously hungry for a hardcore breakfast adventure here.  Other than my two suggestions, this homey place is a local favorite which brings a lot of good vibes to your belly."}
{"text":"I'm not much of a pancake person.  To me, they're usually a little monotonous in taste and there's always a little too much for me to finish.  I eat them last in big breakfast platters since I fizzle out halfway through.    Except for Blueberry Hill's Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes, I can eat them ALL DAY.  They made me a fan all over again for pancakes!  I felt like a kid again where I couldn't get enough of them!  (However, I get the fresh fruit compote on the side - it's a little over-the-top for breakfast for me, very sweet and a lot of it.)    Their french toast is also excellent.  All of their breakfast is a good standard.  Nothing spectacular in terms of seasoning with their potatoes.    The service is pretty good as well.  I've been once during the day and usually once every other week at 2/3AM.  It rotates between two different servers and they both are personable and attentive.    Once in a while I'll get the Mexican Sampler since a friend of mine suggested it to me.  I highly suggest you get it with chicken because the one time I wavered and tried it with beef I was quite disappointed.  It was greasy and not savory.  With chicken it's pretty decent.  Their marinara sauce served with the chicken parm and meatball sandwiches is a bit bland and boring, and they're very light with it.  I like to get a little extra on the side.  Also, they serve small waters and you have to request if you'd like a larger water, which is a little annoying.  I mean, come on, it's water, it's FREE!  Don't be stingy!"}
{"text":"The food was decent. The waffle was a real standout, but everything else seemed like standard diner fare at best. I was disappointed to find out their corned beef hash is not homemade, even though the front of the menu \"brags\" they make most everything in house.   It's almost a throwback to a 50's style diner, with the music and slight soda shop feel, but not quite hitting the mark as it also looks a little neglected and a lack of pride. The menus on the table had ketchup or other condiments on them."}
{"text":"This place used to be good. It had been over a year since I was at this or any location and the blueberry muffins that used to be great were not, albertsons bakery is better not. Breakfast was as good as anywhere else. I probably won't try again when I am on that side of town."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast! I had the coconut chicken and waffles and no syrup was needed. Lightly sweet and delicious. The people with me got a Wild West omelet and potato pancakes. Everything was delicious and came out fast. Good service and fair price for an abundance of food. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Blueberry Hill is a great local diner. Prices are modest, but portions are huge. The omelettes are made with FOUR eggs! They're huge. Granted, they aren't the prettiest things, but they are packed with filling. Plus, they are open 24 hours.  Even in Vegas, finding a decent, convenient 24 hour place can be somewhat tricky.    The coffee is pretty weak, but what do expect from a diner?  We tried two of the omelettes. The corned beef hash omelette was packed with hash, cheddar cheese, onions, and pepper. The eggs were surprisingly fluffy, though they wouldn't win a beauty contest.  The apple chicken sausage omelette was also good, though I found the sausage was a bit meek in flavor. All omelettes are served with a choice of pancakes (which are huge), french toast, or hash browns and toast.  The place was packed to the rafters, but service was decent. The kitchen was slow, but out waitress was great.  She was one of those older diner waitresses whom you'd expect would put her hand on your shoulder and call you honey as she refilled your coffee. Much to my disappointment, she didn't, but she kept our water glasses and coffee mugs full.  Definitely will be back the next time I am in Vegas. I had to give this place two $$ signs, but it would be on the very low end of that range. I would estimate about $11-14 per person, including your meal and a soft drink or cup o' joe."}
{"text":"Highs: People were nice.  Pancakes were delicious!!!!! ( 3 stars for that)  Lows : My BFF got a steak omelette, nope.  Looked nothing like an omelette. Didn't taste good.  Place needs an update. Bathroom was run down and unkempt."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast, brunch or whatever you are in the mood for! Large portions and great service. Directions were spot on when using Google or Yelp!!"}
{"text":"I am going to keep this review short and simple. I yelped a breakfast location and noticed Blueberry Hill was pretty close to where we were staying.  I remember eating at a Blueberry Hill in Chicago and the food was amazing! Now, because of my last experience, I was pretty hyped to try this location out. I have to say l was  a lil dissapointed. The location looked a bit run down. The atmosphere was cold and busy; and the food was blah!  Our server was okay at first but than l felt a lil bothered after his constant return to the table. I felt like we were being rushed and we were only into 5min of having our food. The pancakes looked amazing but were tastless. The biscuits and gravy were not good and what l enjoyed most was my pepsi and toast.   I was not a happy person when l left."}
{"text":"We stop here every Vegas trip. Its a nice break from the strip with large portions and fair prices. You can't go wrong here with basic pancakes and french toast."}
{"text":"A terrific spot for breakfast and I'm sure other meals are just as good. Food is cooked just like you ordered it, friendly staff, reasonable prices, and a FULL plate of food. Took me two days to recover! This will definitely be a \"go to\" for us on each Vegas visit."}
{"text":"This place must be for people with hangovers who just need something in their bellies. This place was disgusting. My sausage skillet was full of potatoes, a few pieces of sausage and cheap ass cheese. My boyfriend found only one piece of bacon his skillet. And my orange juice was full of ice cubes."}
{"text":"When yur in Vegas plz go 2 Blueberry Hills bakery their food is so delicious & the prices r so affordable. Sheila & I had such a great breakfast. We pass that same place Saturday while looking 4 sum where 2 go eat lunch, we thought it was a bakery, man I wish we would of stop we wouldn't had been disappointed the food was fire & Lily the waitess was so helpful n kind thx girl. When am back in Vegas am sure 2 hit y'all up again 4 so good food."}
{"text":"This is a very popular spot with my coworkers. You can get a seriously large meal for a good price. And the service is friendly and attentive, especially if you're a regular. And the food is surprisingly good for a 24/7 coffee shop. Plus there's the whole 50s/ 60s vibe with the music. Its nothing gourmet or unique, but it ain't bad."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! Don't let the building or decor influence your decision to come in. When I'm back in town, I'll be sure to visit this place again!!"}
{"text":"I've been living in Las Vegas for 14 years now and I had never stepped foot into a Blueberry Hill.  Came in for lunch and was immediately seated, it was not very packed, I assume it's because of the weather. I usually drive by and the parking lot is full.  The only thing that disappointed me are the specials. They have different ones for different days of the week and they only serve them on the days assigned. I will definitely be coming back on a Tuesday for their pot roast special.   I decided to go with the popeye chicken. It was really yummy. It came with green beans, mashed potatoes with gravy and a side of chicken noodle soup. The chicken itself in the entree was really juicy, smothered in cheese and spinach.  The chicken noodle soup was very hearty. I was very satisfied with my meal.  To finish the meal off, I ordered a stack of the Oreo pancakes. All I can say is WOW. I had never seen such big, beautiful, fluffy pancakes. I took a bite and my taste buds exploded. Service was great. Our waitress was friendly and our food came out pretty quick. The restaurant itself has a nice, old school vibe. I need to come here often and try everything!"}
{"text":"The BEST pancakes and breakfast place ever. Period. In all of Vegas. And cheap too!   So, when the slots have got you down (no matter the hour, this place serves breakfast 24hrs a day!) just take your last $7 to Blueberry Hill, sit down with a Slotplayers Breakfast \"3333\" and a cup o' joe and let your financial worries melt away with each bite. It's made from scratch...You've hit the Jackpot here baby!  I almost hate telling the un-locals about this place but since I'm not even one myself anymore I thought I'd clue the rest of the world in on this Vegas secret. By the way, there are 4 or 5 other locations and all are equally good (but as some other yelpers have noticed, lunch and dinner are not their strong points--stick to breakfast and you won't be disappointed)."}
{"text":"Great diner to go to if you want a lot of options! I was a little overwhelmed when I first saw the menu but probably only because I haven't been to a diner in forever. They have a good variety of dishes and they come in big portions so I recommend ordering a bunch and sharing if you're eating as a group.  Honey coconut chicken waffle: 3/5. It wasn't bad but there was nothing memorable about it. I wish the chicken was a little crispier! The waffle was pretty good with the honey butter but I've definitely had better chicken and waffles elsewhere.   Farmer's smoked sausage omelette: 3/5. The sausage was tasty but omelette itself was meh. I felt like I could make this myself at home and it would taste better (maybe...)  Blueberry's meat lover's skillet: 5/5. This was probably my favorite dish. The sausage, bacon, and ham were seasoned very well with the potatoes and veggies (onion, green peppers, and tomato) and the eggs on top came out perfectly. EGGPORN. It also comes with a sauce on the side (I think salsa?) that added some more flavor too.   Biscuits and gravy: 2/5. The gravy itself was good but the biscuits weren't as crispy or buttery as I expected. Just seemed like regular bread and was actually too soft for me. They give you a lot though...  Chocolate Oreo pancakes: 5/5. We ate this last, kinda like as a dessert. The pancakes were nice and fluffy and actually wasn't too sweet! The vanilla icing drizzled on top added a ton of sweetness but I really enjoyed it. Good amount of Oreo pieces sprinkled on top as well. It comes with 4 big pancakes so I recommend sharing.  I would give this place 3.5/5 but since the prices are reasonable and the portions are big, I think 4 stars is fair. There was a line when we went on Saturday around noon so expect a wait!"}
{"text":"It's definitely stepping back in time. the food is good it still has that personal touch. It was nice to have a place for you could go sit at the bar and still have breakfast. My waitress reminded me of someone's grandmother working hard. she was a joy."}
{"text":"Blueberry Hill is a classic establishment here in the Vegas Valley that has an incredible variety of breakfast food offerings. It is open 24 hours a day, which allows customers many opportunities over the course of the day to get their fix of breakfast goodies.  Highlight of the menu: their French toast is absolutely delectable, it is made with Hawaiian sweet bread, which makes it just melt in your mouth.   The customer service here is always consistent and expected. The waitresses know the menu inside and out and are always ready to re-fill waters, coffees, and take special requests.  Show up early in the day if you are coming on a weekend because it gets busy and the wait can sometimes be overwhelming.  I would definitely recommend this breakfast joint to anyone interested in a quick, easy eating experience that is quality first."}
{"text":"Breakfast rocks! Not only do they have great food. They are a 24/7 diner. Only thing I didn't like is if you want to place an order over the phone you have to give them your cc # which is never smart. No biggie though, it was worth the wait. I highly recommend this spot for any breakfast cravings."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of IHOP, but little did I know that there were greater heights in the breakfast hierarchy. When I was seated I must have spent 15 minutes drooling over the dozens of savory options before I could narrow it down to an omelet or a skillet. Then a quick bit of eeny Meany miney Moe helped make my final decision.   The meat lovers skillet was delicious, filling, and the portion was big enough for 2 meals. I would highly recommend blueberry hill to everyone. Their wait-staff was patient, quick on drink refills, and knowledgeable about the menu such that they helped make recommendations to the table on which combo to order exactly what we wanted."}
{"text":"So far, I've only had the breakfast here, and actually just the omelets (corned beef and the farmer's).  The food is good enough, nothing spectacular.  I do like the fact that you can have blueberry muffin instead of toast.  The server was polite, had no problem bringing out ranch dressing with my hash browns (weird combo I like).  It's also the only thing open past 10 pm not in a casino and reasonably priced in the area.  Not a bad place to sit down and have a casual meal with a buddy.  I do have to complain about the fact that they don't serve dark chicken meat (white is too dry for me)."}
{"text":"I don't get it what's the big deal with this place. The food is edible... That's all I can say for this place. Not much different than Denny's, maybe a little better. Not a go to place, just an after thought kind of a place for food."}
{"text":"Fast, very, very friendly service. Food was above average. We ate at a nearby casino with a breakfast special of $5.99. This place was $10.00 more on my bill, BUT I have a better experience! Lots of stuff on the menu, looking forward to coming back tomorrow."}
{"text":"Huge portions for side dishes. Got the gravy and biscuit side (one huge biscuit), and couldn't finish it. Blueberry Pie was also good with a flaky crust. Attentive and courteous staff. Great 1:00 a.m. visit."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and the quality of the food and service hasn't changed at all. It's a very welcoming restaurant especially late after hours, since they're open 24/7. The food is your typical diner fare, anything you want served all day. The desserts are great too. If you plan on coming at peak hours or during the weekend, you're in for a short wait but it's nothing too major. I love this place and it will always be a place I frequently visit."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The portions are huge, the pancakes are some of the best I've ever tasted and our waitress, Violeta was a ray of sunshine! They're a little pricey but it's totally worth it! Next time we know we can share entrees too"}
{"text":"Outstanding!!!  Great food and lots of it.  Now, the place isn't the prettiest place on earth, but the food is great, the service excellent, the price is great, and i'll go back anytime.  The B & G are great and huge!"}
{"text":"All I can say is OMG! absolutely the best chocolate pancakes ever! Also the biscuits and gravy are to die for. Its a must go if your anywhere near. I will return for sure. The server (Sally) was VERY personable and helpful. Will ask for her section the next visit too"}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast spot. Huge portions you might consider splitting a meal omelettes are huge and delicious. Bread all looks home made best breakfast in Vegas so far not to mention the best value."}
{"text":"If you want chicken fried steak, this is the place to go. I've tried it at many different places and was never satisfied. It's funny I still eat chicken fried steak after all my experiences lol. My kids enjoyed themselves as well. I love their kids deal. Definitely saved myself like $10-$15 today. I am a happy camper. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Poor customer service! The cashier when i went in this morning to have breakfast before we head out to the airport has an attitude. I asked for a small to go plastic container when she handed it to me i did not realized that it's too small for the food that I want to take home and so I asked if I can get the next bigger box she has, then she answered with an attitude \"we'll you said small!\". So I just ignored her and again asked for a plastic bag to put in my to go food, she did not answer me and instead just pointed out where I can grab them plus she gave me an annoying look. We'll this kind of reception I got from her, I'll probably not coming back on this restaurant next time I visit Vegas!"}
{"text":"Love the food here, prices arent bad espically the specials for breakfast, the most fluffiest pancakes ever! Mouthwatering yummyness!! Definitely a busy place i perfer the breakfast over all... Cant wait to come back to Las Vegas just to eat here"}
{"text":"I got blue boy, 2 pancakes with blueberry sauce, ham and 2 eggs, with coffee. Ham and eggs were what you can get anywhere else. But the coffee was good and yes, blueberry pancakes were extremely good. I don't think the price is very cheap, but I will definitely go back for pancakes."}
{"text":"I'd heard about Blueberry Hill many times in the past, but just never had an occasion to go. However, it seemed to fit the bill as our last big meal before the half-marathon on Sunday.  As everyone has mentioned, the menu is huge, as are the portions. I had the blueberry pancake special, which had two big pancakes, eggs, hash browns and sausage, while my mom had the strawberry crepes, eggs, and ham.  Everything was served hot and fresh. My pancakes were thick and dense, but I REALLY loved my mom's crepes! I will definitely have to try them next time I visit. I didn't love the ham (it was really salty), but everything else was good.  It was definitely old-school and a little dated, but everything appeared clean and the service was friendly. We had leftovers, too!"}
{"text":"Went on a Wednesday morning with co-workers so had no problem getting seated quickly. Place has a standard diner feel. I had never been before and it's in the area of my office so I really wanted to give it a shot.   I went with the recommendation of the server (great service) and went with the honey coconut chicken and waffle. It was a Belgian waffle with lightly fried chicken breast and honey. The server mentioned it was 'YUMMY' and I just found it to be 'ok'.   I have no complaints about anything I had here or that happened here but it's not something I'll ever get a craving for. It was just average."}
{"text":"blueberry hill is one of those classic late night or morning after huts to frequent when you need something quick, reliable, and tasty. I have personally grown up on the alaskan waffle topped with ice cream and strawberries. I've also experienced blueberry hill for morning after bloody mary's and night coconut cream pie. Regardless of your late night foodie needs, blueberry hill is a great place to stuff your face and shoot the shit for as many hours as you please with a smiling face and full mug of coffee ready to go."}
{"text":"BEST PANCAKES IN THE WORLD. So fluffy and moist. Truly the best I've ever had. The French toast was mediocre. I wouldn't recommend. If you're gonna come here, ONLY GET THEIR PANCAKES!"}
{"text":"Okay so its Monday and I was starving when I woke up and I knew I had a long day at work today and I really wanted to get something that was going to stick to my ribs; I live in Aliante but work was taking me to the central part of the town so I decided to head to this  Blueberry Hill.  I miss the one that used to be the base and so I do not go as much as I used to.  I was greeted promptly by a lady named Susie (more about how she saved the day later) and she sat me in a quiet section of the restaurant.  I had came in very early and so there were not many people in the place yet.  What happened next upset me so that I was preparing to walk out.  There were at least four to five female servers  standing around gabbing about their weekend and none of them acknowledged me.  I was there at the table at least for ten minutes and then there was a lady that was sat right behind me and literally right when her tush hit the sea one of those servers went right over and took her order.  I was stunned.  so  I calmly got my stuff together and went up to cash register because in spite of no one asking for my order I was still going to place an order because I enjoy their food. There was a lady named Pam that came to the register (I am going to assume she was the morning manager) and she asked me if everything was OK and I told her no.  She asked why and I told her and she was visibly upset and turned to the four servers who were back in their huddle and asked them why was I not served.  Susie, the server who was in a different section promptly said \"sweetie I will get you served as soon as possible \" sat me down took my order and apologized for All the servers and the lack of respect and customer service that occurred  I so appreciated her and her kindness that I tipped her Before I got my meal. She is a sweet lady from New York and I get the feeling has been a server for years and she can teach the younger generation a thing or two.  I am one of the people that realize serving tables in a restaurant is not easy and I believe in tipping great servers well and Susie is a great server.   Another gentleman that worked in Susie section and bused her tales  named Freddy was also super nice.  I was prepared never to come back to this location but just with those kind gestures it made me change my mind.  Susie saved a customer and I thank her."}
{"text":"Would have given it one star but threw in an extra star cause the food was edible. I've been trying to support local restaurants more, instead of chains. Think I might go back to chains.  When I walked in here I was asked what I wanted to drink before I even sat down and was asked what I wanted to order before I'd even opened the menu. OK...so I finally get my food. I'm excited because it tastes pretty decent. As I'm getting into my 3rd bite of pancake, I smell lemon floor cleaner. Yep..the custodian thought it would be a good idea to mop the entire dining room area right in the middle of lunchtime. He even cleaned right under my table as i was eating...awesome! Lemon Cleaner, wet floor, and dirty mop does not mix with breakfast. Totally turned me off of finishing my meal. At this point I just decided to get the rest of my food to go and never return....ever."}
{"text":"Great music delicious pigs in blanket served with warm maple syrup! Denver omelette with very fluffy eggs Sweet waitress A spot where the locals hang out so you know the food is good!"}
{"text":"Family owned, small, delicious. Pricey and poor parking  I've always known about this place and have finally gotten around to trying it. Went after church so it was pretty busy with a line to the door, but it moved pretty quickly.  Pretty laid back and casual. Food was a but pricey but worth it imo. French toast as bomb, omelet was great and had nice sized ham chunks. Funny we didn't try the pancakes, maybe next time, french toast a better choice at the time. Hash was ok, just different and bland, they use flat slices of potato and parts were hard almost burnt while some was still soft, i guess some people like it that way. I prefer smaller pieces cooked more evenly.  You might have to ask for jelly for your toast, they only gave me 1 strawberry and 1 grape when served, there isn't any on the table. We sat in a 2seater so it felt very cramped to have anything stored anyway. They leave the menus on the table against the wall, coffee cups, sugar etc. Point is the caddy they use made me feel our food was gonna be hanging off the table. But everything barely fit.  Pay on the way out.  I would def return for more french toast or to try the pancakes, but i don't go to breakfast places for dinner entrees, almost never. :) Come here if you want a GOOD food change from ihops and dennys, and have a lil extra to spend. Not bad though 2 of us cost under 30"}
{"text":"Ive been walking this earth for almost 27 years.. This is the best breakfast i have ever had lol.  My mom told me to get hired here just so I can figure out why their pancakes are so good lol.  Everyone that comes to visit me I always bring them here.  My favorites are The Waitress Special Waffles w/Apple Cinnamon Compote & Whip Cream, The Four Cheese Fresh Fruity French Toast, The Meat Lovers Skillets (mostly everyone likes this one), Hand-Crafted Gourmet Apple Chicken Sausage Waffle (Dads Favorite), and The Chocolate Oreo Pancakes!! Im not a big chocolate fan but the Oreo Pancakes are bomb!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food!! Big portions and great fast service. A must for breakfast when in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Blueberry Hill is an awesome breakfast/lunch/dinner joint all around. It is the place you bring family for Sunday brunch, it is the place where you come post a night of crazy partying on the strip, and it is the place you bring all your friends who have heard you raving about this \"Vegas Gem\" for years. This was the case for me during my road trip to see \"Britney: A Piece of Me\" a few weeks back. As our last meal in Vegas, I can proudly say everyone in my party was pleased with the recommendation I pushed on them since the beginning of our mini vacation.             We came in on a Saturday and there was no wait. What??? No wait on one of the busiest brunch days of the week: extra brownie points!  We were seated quickly and our waiter almost immediately came out with iced waters for the entire table. He proceeded to take our drink orders, which he too brought out with the speed of light. Since we are all a group of avid foodies, we had previously studied the menu through Yelp and pretty much knew what we were getting. I ordered the Chocolate Chip Pancakes (my staple choice at this here restaurant), while the rest of my group went for more savory options. The Chocolate Pancakes stand out due to what they deliver; a chocolate indulgence at its finest. There is not one bite lacking chocolaty galore when it comes to these bad boys. As for the rest of my friends' orders, one of my besties (who managed to convince the rest of the five to give this restaurant a go) ordered the Potato Benedict, which she deemed as \"one of the best Benedicts\" she has consumed to date. I tried a bit of the biscuits and gravy off of my friend's dish and \"oh la la\", so so scrumptious. At the end of the meal, everyone was a happy camper and ready to hit the road with full bellies. Food Coma defined!         We all tipped our waiter decently because the man was excellent. This is a trend of Blueberry's all around: excellence in service, food, and ambiance (such a relaxing, homey vibe). Five stars all the way! Sadly, I have yet to try the cakes, pies, or cheesecakes. Next time! There will always be a next between me and Blueberry Hill."}
{"text":"Food was OK.  I would compare to Denny's for taste.  Waitress was nice and on the spot.  You lose 3 stars for the cashier named Kathy.  Very rude, demanding.  Never asked how my meal was.  I observed her treat 2 customers in front of me the same way.  I recommend this place with caution."}
{"text":"Worst place and service ever! We brought in panda express for my son but were alao going to order food and drinks here. They waited for us to sit down and order drinks, then decided to have the bus boy tell us that we cannot bring in outside food. What a scam! They couldn't tell us that before they seated us?? I will not be returning to this restaurant. Wish I could give 0 stars!!"}
{"text":"One of my Dad's favorite breakfast places.  The skillet breakfasts are quite tasty and filling.  Their corned beef hash is almost as good as what he makes from scratch on the rare occasion.  The wait can be long but if you are willing to eat at the counter you'll have your food in no time.  Friendly service!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved it! On a recent trip to, Vegas we happened to come across this restaurant. On a Sunday night we stopped for dinner. I had the most fluffy,buttery tasting pancakes I've ever eaten. Also, they were huge! I had no idea when the server asked if I wanted 3 or 5 that was a tip. Since I love pancakes of course I said 5!  the plate arrived and I knew this was going to be a personal challenge. I failed, I made a great attempt but could only eat 2. However, I will tell you they warmed up great the next day! We revisited for lunch a few days later. I had the Chilaqules Verde. Delicious. The eggs were cooked perfectly, and tbe sauces were wonderful. Definitely recommend this as a stop on your trip."}
{"text":"I did not really like this place. The food was alright. The menu is like 8 pages long. They have way too many options. They need to condense their menu. Anytime you have a resturant that serves 8 pages worth of different foods, you automatically now that most of the food is probably frozen and genetically modified, there is no was a few chefs are cooking 68 different food items."}
{"text":"Another casual spot close to the university that serves as a fun meeting point for solid diner grub.  (I've been told it's also a great place to remedy a night of overhydration....)  I had a lovely apple sausage omelet with 3 buttermilk pancakes as a (huge) side; everything was hot, fresh, and yummy.  Piggie that I am, I ate the whole thing, much to the admiration of my brunch buddy.  :)  Our server was super nice and joked with us whilst taking our order, delivering our food, and whisking away our cleaned dishes.  Great value and comfy environment make this a winner in my books."}
{"text":"It took a little while standing in line. I didn't expect this breakfast joint to be so busy. Especially at 11:48 on a Sunday morning. We were a party of four and had to sit at one of those two chairs on one side and a booth on the other. Not to fond of those. The menu is at the table and there is quite a few options to pick from. I was wanting chicken fried steak and some pancakes. To me these are the best tasting pancakes I've had in awhile. Nice and fluffy with a ton of flavor. Other than that it's just an older dinner with a ton of customers.  I'll be back to order something else in the near future."}
{"text":"My judgement may be biased, being I've only ever been here after a long night out or at work, but they got a fantastic diner menu. I recommend the fettucine alfredo w/chicken and waffles. Oh, and the chicken strips are pretty good too!"}
{"text":"The food is so good and the portions here are large! I loved the French Toast with strawberries. Each omelette is made with four eggs! The waitress was so nice and helpful. The atmosphere is warm and inviting, You feel like your eating at a family members home.  This place is packed at times. However, parking was not a problem."}
{"text":"Yummmmm! Enormous portions and fast friendly service. Big restaurant, diner feel. Nancy was so sweet with perfect customer service. The food was so delicious....like surprisingly delicious for a diner. The pancakes are to die for and the apple chicken and waffles are something you have to try! Even the regular coffee is great. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty packed for breakfast, we went around 11am.  My husband and I tried something different, since we usually take the kids to Ihop. The food was alright. The kids loved the pancakes. My server was really polite, and the tab for all four of us came out to like 60$ for breakfast. Not bad, but it wasn't exactly a buffet. I will go back, but prob not to this location, the area was a little ghetto looking, and traffic is a mess over on this side of town."}
{"text":"Well..... While the food is pretty awesome, the service sure does leave something to be desired... I arrived a few moments before the rest of my party and figured I would get the table and have a seat, but even after the hostess went and found a table for my group, she refused to seat me once she was told the rest of my party would be here in a few minutes, but followed it up with \"But I do have a table for you\"... Once the rest of my group arrived, she took a good look at the diverse culture standing in front of her and said \"Hold on, I have to find you another table\" and proceeded to walk around the restaurant... Finally she came back and asked us to follow her, all the way through the right of the restaurant into a separate room that seemed to be full of anyone \"of color\"... I know, I know, I thought this was a little far fetched myself, until I decided to walk back through the restaurant to the restroom (which is located completely on the other side) and it wasn't hard to take notice of the fact that there was not a single black person in that entire section of the restaurant!! Needless to say, regardless of how good the food is, my family will not be returning here..."}
{"text":"The wife and I were in Vegas for a Spartan Race and wanted a good place to eat some breakfast that was close to Sam's Town. So, did a little research and went here on a Saturday morning. The place was pretty full, but we were seated right away. Ordered and got our food fairly quickly. The portions are huge, so we couldn't even finish one order of pancakes. All of the food was great, and we thought so highly of the place that we ate here again on Monday before leaving to go home. I would highly recommend Blueberry Hill for breakfast. I don't know about other meals, but everything looked great on the menu."}
{"text":"Been here twice for breakfast after getting off my graveyard shifts and the service is phenomenal but also the food is great! I can honestly say this has become one of my favorite dine in restaurants and the plus it's 24 hours!! They have a both american and mexican plates on the menu many many options to choosw from"}
{"text":"Great diner! Perfect for hangovers (when in Vegas) good prices, and even better portions! Coffee tasted great and not burnt. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant and I had great service. The food was full filling and tasty. My family loved it. I enjoyed the ambiance. Prices was not bad considering  that the portion was generous."}
{"text":"Blueberry Hill is so delicious. We are from California and visit Vegas a couple of times a year. We always stop by Blueberry Hill every time before leaving. I had the waffles, and they were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. My husband had biscuit and gravy and the breakfast pork chops. He thoroughly enjoyed his meal. It was such a treat."}
{"text":"Blueberry Hill is my all-time favorite comfort food restaraunt in all of Las Vegas.   The service is friendly and the staff makes you feel like family.   The environment has a 50's diner feel. Coffee & soda refills come as quickly as you can drink them. I base my tip amount on how long I wait for a refill and here, so far, I'm never empty.   But the food. Omigoodness. Best pancakes in town. I won't eat pancakes anywhere else, ever again. Everything you could possibly want at breakfast time: waffles, crepes, sausage & bacon, hash browns. Wow. Large portions. Food is hot and fresh.    And the cakes, pies and desserts are just as amazing.  Give this place a try. I'm certain you will enjoy it."}
{"text":"I was thrilled to try another 24 HR breakfast diner in Las Vegas that's been around since 1987. Blueberry Hill makes REAL pancakes from scratch! BIG, Fluffy, old fashioned buttermilk pancakes that taste like heaven with blueberries (I hope there are blueberries in heaven). Our second dish was the waffles and chicken. The chicken was perfectly crispy on the outside and moist and tender inside. The sweet waffle shouldn't have worked but it did!  All you can drink coffee and if you leave room for dessert, there's pie Next time!"}
{"text":"60's Style Diner with fresh coffee (hot or iced) and booths set up with everything you'd need for breakfast (all day) lunch, dinner or just desserts.  Don't get turned off by the dated decor because the chefs in the back whip up over a hundred different items with breakfast served all day! The service is pleasant, knowledgable and friendly if you're into talking. Try the Blueberry Pancakes, they're AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"Found this neat little spot while looking for diners to eat at in Vegas and boy am I glad we did! When we walked in the place was packed, a clear sign that it's popular with locals and tourist. Even though we were a large party, they were able to seat us fairly quickly. The menu was large they have everything from breakfast to burgers. I opted for the \"Waitress Special\" the Belgium waffle that came with it was fluffy and amazing! I'd highly recommend there pancakes and desserts. Overall nice diner with amazing food at a for price. Would love to visit again."}
{"text":"It was our first time and it was delicious , I can't even explain the taste was so fresh and waitress was very nice. We had pancakes and French toast the best we have ever had!!!"}
{"text":"Another very nice visit.  Our server was in a great mood, smiling the whole time, and we were able to enjoy a nice coffee shop breakfast.  Please note, this is not fine dining, but they do have something on the menu for everybody.  My son ordered a low fat high protein breakfast and two poached eggs arrived with a plate of fresh fruit.  It looked great.  My wife had eggs and bacon and they arrived as expected, and I had a two eggs over east served on a bed of sausage, potatoes an vegetables with a spicy salsa.  It was served with a choice of bread and I opted for the blueberry muffin.  I really enjoyed my breakfast.  If you'd like to go to a non-casino breakfast place that focusses on locals, this is a pleasant option."}
{"text":"Yep, I'll be back.  Good food, fast friendly service, nice clean environment.  This is the recipe for success that I enjoy.    I had the Chorizo Benedict (they call it the South of the Border Eggs Benedict) .....mmmm, never ever even thought that type of meal could exist, but there it is, and I enjoyed it.  I was a tourist, but this was a locals place.  It was busy, and I suspect that Las Vegas locals have a few choices for their breakfast dollars.      See you there."}
{"text":"Sadly, the only thing that was tasty were the things that were NOT homemade. The hash browns were slices of mushy potato and not seasoned right. The gravy is easy to make and very basic but tasted OK, as it should, though, nothing special. I ordered over medium eggs and they were over hard. I'm very particular about this having been a breakfast cook for many years. The chicken fried steak I could almost guarantee was frozen and not fresh but not because of the flavor. It tasted good but just a guess from other hints. Didn't matter about that but was just disappointed that all of the homemade things were not standing out like they seemed so proud of. If it weren't for the nicely cooked frozen fried steak, my rating would be lower. So, if they didn't try bragging that it's all homemade, I probably would've never known and possibly given higher. Server needs to season with less sugar, if you know what I mean. Almost like she was expecting a review. I kind of expect a cranky server because that's how they are on the east coast so it actually lost its 'diner' feel."}
{"text":"We usually go to the Flamingo and Decataur location. Which after our experience here yesterday will be the only one we go to. All the others we've gone to are run down and the employees are not up to that location's bar of excellence.   Our waitress took forever to take our order, I was able to walk to the CVS and back before our food came, the eggs were gross and then both our waitress and the manager had attitudes and tried to charge us MORE for taking them off when we complained about them.   I always tip 20% unless the server is horrible. This the first time EVER that I didn't tip at all."}
{"text":"There are no better pancakes anywhere on the planet or maybe in the universe.  Fast friendly service at any hour it made our 5am anniversary celebration finisher delicious and delightful and boy we slept well!"}
{"text":"My first time eating here and I WILL be back. Everything is homemade inside the restaurant. The waitress said one day they couldn't serve bread because they ran out of yeast. (Bread is awesome, btw) I had the Roast Turkey dinner and it is amazing! They also have a $7.77 menu which includes a list of meals to chose from and comes with corn bread, drink, soup or salad, meal AND dessert! Breakfast from 5-11am for $4.99 as well. This might be my new favorite restaurant!"}
{"text":"I ate at this spot somewhat regularly when I lived out in Las Vegas, it was close to where I lived and it being open 24 hours made it even better. The food here is good. I almost always ordered the same food with each visit because I am a creature of habit but it always tasted good and portions were ample as well. Pricing was moderate which is a plus for those on a budget. I really loved the Old school diner feel of this place. very welcoming, and homey atmosphere."}
{"text":"Soooooo yummy!! One of the best pancakes and French toast I have ever had in my life!!!!!!!!!!! Even though they were busy the service was fast and ppl were friendly. Best breakfast place in Vegas. They were even better than the famous kekes in Orlando!"}
{"text":"Fiance found this place on Yelp.  It is another place we would have never stopped at had it not been for all the Yelp reviews.  These were the best pancakes I've ever had.  As the fiance said, \"what in the pancake is going on here?!\"  Seriously good.  Only giving them 4 stars because the place was a little ghetto-ish.  But who cares when the pancakes are that good??"}
{"text":"The best of the Blueberry Hill restaurants in town. Counter service is reminiscent of diners in NJ."}
{"text":"Big portions. Homemade food. Mom and pops like diner. Reminds me of where I grew up (the middle of nowhere.)"}
{"text":"Blueberry Hill is one of those places you keep coming back to because the food is reliable, tasty and filling. Essentially a fancy diner, they're not going to knock your socks off with esoteric and strange cuisine, but you will find more than enough comfort food to keep you happy.  The service is always friendly and the portions ample.  Generally this is a breakfast spot for us. They have fancy pancake concoctions that keep my other half intrigued, while I go for the savory breakfast items, ranging from steak and eggs to breakfast skillets to huevos rancheros etc.   Coincidentally, years ago this is the first place we tried that exotic concoction known as chicken and waffles. Fried chicken served over a Belgian waffle was unexpectedly delicious. These days everyone has taken it to new levels, bacon sriracha cheese waffles etc...but sometimes the original is more satisfying.  I always go away happy, and that's kind of what it's all about. If you're in town and happen across this review, this is a good place to cure your hangover, or fulfill your cravings for comfort food ranging from American diner fare to Mexican to Burgers to you name it!"}
{"text":"Whenever I pass through Vegas my family always decides to stop here. They're open 24/7 so they have all sorts of items on the menu, for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. I love that you can still order breakfast in the afternoon, which is perfect for me since I love their blueberry pancakes. Their portions are also really big, and their prices are always much better compared to expensive places on the Strip. Service is also great here, and the staff is extremely friendly. Definitely have recommended this place to friends!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious at any hour of the day. I can't say much more besides just go there and try to finish your pancakes. You'll be beyond full but you'll keep trying to finish them. Get the oreo ones and thank me later."}
{"text":"Te way to my fat girl heart? Biscuits and gravy! Yesssssss.  They are so good here, they are fresh, rich and huge portions. You can tell that theyre made from scratch. dont get them if your on a diet. Second best in my book. I loved that it was served it in a skillet. Really made it cute. Nom, nom nom.  I hear the French that is good, so I will try that next time.  I tried some of my daughter pancakes which were fluffy and light. Delicious.   The eggs and sausage were just okay, nothing special. Asked for cheese on the eggs and they threw a piece of sliced cheese on there that didn't even melt. Yuck.   This place was packed so I suggest coming at brunch time. This place looks really old fashioned and the serves looked very seasoned.  My dad loved that the server his age (40s?) kept calling him honey, babe and sweet thang. Oh gosh, it was hilarious. She was very good at refilling our drinks and coffee. Considering how busy she was, she was great at checking up on us making sure we were happy."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go when I'm in Vegas. No trip to Vegas isn't without a stop to Blueberry Hill for either biscuits and gravy or some blueberry pancakes."}
{"text":"This is not a fancy place if that's what your looking for. It's kinda mom and pop restaurant. Been here for 3 times in a week now and I can say they are running a good show; although it's always but don't stress out because you will be seated right away. Food will be served fast and it's satisfying. All the staff are very attentive and friendly plus the price is so reasonable. PS: they also have a mexican food included in the menu and cakes for dessert!"}
{"text":"I took my friend out to Blueberry Hill yesterday because the food is delicious, but the service I experienced was horrible. After 15 minutes of waiting no one had even come to take our drink order. I had to find a waitress and ask if we could order our drinks and our food. When ordering, my friend wanted french toast, which comes with a side of eggs and bacon. She did not want the eggs and asked if there was a way to replace the eggs with something else. They made the request seem so unreasonable. The waitress said she would check with the manager to see if the request could be fulfilled, yet she never got back to us. When the food came out, my friend was able to get another slice of bacon, but the waitress threatened that this was a one time thing, and next time they would have to charge for extra bacon. After all that, we waited patiently for the check, which took forever to receive because our waitress was gossiping with her co-worker. The only reason I gave this place 2 stars is because the pancakes were to die for."}
{"text":"Glorified over priced Dennie's,  thought we were saving money getting so far from the strip, but we would have been better off staying on the strip.  Second time here and won't return."}
{"text":"As we walked out tonight we decided this is our last time visiting this restaurant. We've visited this place on several occasions and each time we have the same experience.  Tonight we waited 30 min for our check. That is 30 min from when plates were cleared. This was not a very busy time this evening and we still left a tip but a tip was not earned.  Had to ask for silverware had. Have to always ask for refills.   The food is OK but nothing speciak, it's breakfast for crying out loud. The place is freezing,  the seats are not comfortable and the table and floor were dirty"}
{"text":"Blueberry Hill is a great place to eat!  Everything was great including the Pumpkin Pie. The service was great also, shout out To Sherry!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast around 630 and it was practically empty. Server was quick getting drink order and kept my coffee cup full the whole time. Had the chorizo wrap subbed the rice and beans for the potatoes. Breakfast was great and inexpensive."}
{"text":"Delish. Love that this place is 24 hours. For sure a great late night spot with friends, try the eggs Benedict!!"}
{"text":"I decided to try yelp again for a late night snack in the Las Vegas Area. I found Blueberry Hill Family restaurant due to it's location and average reviews.  We stopped in and it's an older mom and pop type pancake restaurant. The server attended to us 5 minutes in and we ordered the midnight specials.   I go tthe eggs, toast, bacon and hash browns. The hash browns weren't that hot and needed some more salt and pepper. The toast was over cooked.  Once the desert came (included in special) it was a Blueberry muffin that appeared to be a little over cooked and contained like 5 blueberries.  The only reason I give it a 3 star rating is due to the customer service. The lady has worked there for 20+ years and she was a very pleasurable person. If I'm drunk, I might return."}
{"text":"Recently took a trip to Vegas. Got in late from California and was bit on the hungry side. I heard about this place place from a Las Vegas Forum that had a thread about  good breakfasts.   I was craving waffles. I ordered their regular waffle, but I also wanted to save some room for their Chocolate, Chocolate Layer Cake that caught my eye. I ordered it a la mode. The waffle came and it was very good. One of the better waffles I've had. It's kinda hard to mess-up a waffle though. Especially when you are an American \"Family Restaurant.\"   However, I have to say that their chocolate, chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream was amazing. They say it's homemade and I believe it! It had great, smooth chocolate taste, but not over-the-top richness. You gotta get this dessert with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. The vanilla ice cream complements the chocolate cake perfectly. It's a fairly big portion so you can share, but you won't want to! It's a great value for the price you pay. About $4.00. It's also one of the best \"Desserts in the Desert\" that I have experienced so far."}
{"text":"O so good! Service was A++ and the food was delicious! I ordered the banana pancake special, it did not disappoint, my husband had the strawberry pancakes which were sweet and hit that sweet tooth! Surprisingly the salsa was really good and had a nice kick. Looking forward to making this a regular stop on many Vegas trips!"}
{"text":"The food tasted great I had the dealer's breakfast choice of ham, 4 bacon, or 4 sausage links. I chose the ham with eggs and a side of biscuit.  The only complaint I had was our server. I didn't even know her name because she didn't even introduce herself to us. No refills and didn't even stop by to check on us. She even gave the check right after she brought our food. Hello..... how about if we wanted desserts or takeout afterwards.  When they hand you the check minutes after bringing the food. To me that shows lack of courtesy and they want you to get out and leave. Again the food was good but 2 stars off from the bad service.... Will be coming back but will stay away from the lousy server."}
{"text":"They much better food than Denny's.. portions are great and not generic like Denny's...24/7 open"}
{"text":"I found my thrill, on Blueberry Hill.  Living in NY, this place reminds me of a combination of a Long Island Diner mixed together with IHOP, and a coffee shop.  Loved the whole grain pancakes. It was healthy with a non-healthy taste. That equals house of pleasure. Want to go back, need to go back."}
{"text":"solid food in large portions. They'll eagerly take substitutions and make whatever you want.  lots of off street parking and friendly, efficient staff."}
{"text":"mmmm. pancakes. with butter and syrup. side of sausage.  old school cool."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and I must say we'll definitely be back next time we're in Vegas!! I would give a 5 star but the service was ok. They forgot my kids chocolate milks and messed up on my order. Nice waitress but it wasn't that busy for her to get our order wrong. The food was bomb and filling! Definitely recommend this place!! Their muffins are amazing too!!! A must try!"}
{"text":"Like a lot of locals, I first came to the Hill after a night of drinking (great hangover food!). I've since stopped drinking, but I still depend on this place for a solid breakfast.  This location has been codenamed \"the good one\" by Boyfriend and I, so we make the trip on Saturday mornings rather than go to the location right up the street. This location just seems better put together than the others. As a twosome, we are usually seated very quickly. The service is not exceptional, but leaves nothing to be desired. The waitresses are exactly what you'd expect in a diner (after walking in the doors, you have no name. You'll be known as \"honey\" or \"sweetie\").   I can honestly say that I've never gotten a non-breakfast item, given that breakfast is awesome and served 24 hours. My guilty pleasure is the eggs benedict. Whether you get actual poached eggs or not is a toss-up, but it's still tasty. Really, I've never been disappointed.   The Hill is a step down from The Cracked Egg in price and taste, but still quite a few steps from the bottom!"}
{"text":"I hadn't been here in a while and today we went for a late breakfast since my daughters orthodontic appt was a couple doors down.  I wasn't sure if I wanted lunch or breakfast and I went with the waitress special which is a waffle with a side if meat and 2 eggs,  our waitress let me switch to hash Browns wasn't feeling eggs...  The hash Browns and bacon were crispy just like i ordered them and my waffle was perfect,  crispy outside  but creamy on the inside,  my daughter had biscuits and gravy  it was delicious  I kept \"reaching\"  over to hers,  biscuits are fluffy but dense and gravy had chunks of sausage in it   our waitress was awesome and I will go back for sure to try their daily lunch specials!!"}
{"text":"You can be a sucker and wait two hours for bottomless drink options at some over the top brunch spot on the strip (which I've done), or you can take a short drive to this place and risk exploding from eating so much deliciousness. We hit this place THREE TIMES this weekend, I just couldn't say away.  If you're looking for some down to earth, luscious diner food, make the trip. You won't be disappointed. Short wait times, friendly staff, and the food is just perf."}
{"text":"Great diner style breakfast place, IHOP wouldn't do phone pick up orders but Blueberry Hill did and saved they day. We had a to-go order for a large party about 12 orders, so it was understandable that we still had to wait a minute for the order even though we called it in.   I do like the variety of menu options, like coconut fried chicken and waffles! That ended up being a good order, the chicken was coated in shredded coconut and fried giving good texture and a light pop of coconut flavor.   The big breakfast burrito was odd though, it was more like a brunch burrito. The inside was breakfast burrito-ey, but outside it was drenched in red sauce like an enchilada?! It also came with beans and rice with some chips. Quite a meal, but not what you would expect.   If you have time do sit-in and enjoy the meal, but for busy people know that you have the option to just get it to-go."}
{"text":"While we were in Vegas since we had a car we drove around looking for off the strip spots to eat we came across Blueberryhill  there a few of them around Vegas but the one we went to was close to the strip and very very good we went there three times for breakfast and each time it was outstanding. Very pleasant service very efficient and the food very good but would highly recommend walking or taking a cab to Blueberryhill there are many of them around enclosed it's worth the Cab fair"}
{"text":"Great breakfast diner which could probably cure and Vegas sized hangover... Maybe this looks like your standard diner on the surface but they have great service, a clean dining area and the food is good. I had my usual eggs, bacon and hash browns. I also threw in some blueberry pancakes and I'm glad I did because they did a great job with all the meal. The menu is big so they are likely to have your favorite and don't be afraid to overindulge a little because it will be worth it."}
{"text":"The Blueberry Hill on tamarus and Flamingo sucks if you're black please don't go to that restaurant they will wait on customers that came in after you they won't offer you water or coffee nothing a bunch of Mexicans racist ass Mexicans do not go to that restaurant"}
{"text":"We went here for lunch after church and I must say that I was quite impressed.  Our server Emma was just AWESOME!  Our party had several requests and questions and not once did Emma get annoyed or irritated.  She took great care of our group and checked on us several times.  The food was really good too!  I've gone to Blueberry Hill in the past but didn't remember the food to be this good.  Portions were huge and they even offered kids meals for .99 cents!  Even the kids meals were huge and delicious.  Pancakes are fluffy.  Everything we ordered was good.  There were 8 of us and what I remembered was steak and eggs, pancakes, crepes, omelettes, and chicken fried steak.  We'll definitely come back for sure.  Even had tv's so it was a family friendly place to watch some NFL games."}
{"text":"This place is just an old fashion diner type food. They get super crowded on weekends so expect to wait. The menu is massive!!! Food is great for a habgover!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love, love Blueberry Hill!! This is a must any time I am in Vegas. The most amazing chicken fried steak and country gravy (white like it's supposed to be) and fantastic pancakes. At one time they also had some killer biscuits but somewhere along the way they've changed the recipe and they taste like straight lard now.   We don't even bother with casino breakfast or eating on the strip.... we get up early to eat breakfast here. Honestly, if you've never been here for breakfast you should really try it. I can't speak for lunch or dinner but I can tell you that the breakfast is excellent!"}
{"text":"Came in to cure a hangover, I wasn't disappointed. Even though it was filled to the brim with patrons, I took a seat at the bar, and my order was in front of me in about 10 minutes. Waffle was the best I've ever had, crisp light and buttery. Friendly owners greet you at the door and ask how you were when you leave. Nice to see people care about their guests. Thanks for a good morning :)"}
{"text":"HEY! I went here! I don't remember when... But I went here! I took a picture of the sign! It's in my pile of \"pictures to scrapbook\" I remember! Must have been great!"}
{"text":"We love coming here!!! The food is always amazing and consistently delicious!!! The service is great!!! Bettina has been the best server we've had!! We never have to wait for a table, no matter the time of day. Our food comes out quickly. The menu is large and with a lot of variety we always find exactly what we want! They also have great specials! No complaints at all, complete 5 stars!!! Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"our server was rushing us because his shift was ending but the food was pretty decent"}
{"text":"The best fresh squeezed orange juice I've had outside of Florida.  I also recommend the huge 4 egg Denver omelet or Chorizo omelet with egg whites.  You can't go wrong with the hash browns or home fries either which were amazingly not greasy at all.  I didn't get the pancakes or waffles the days we went, but the other guys I was with raved about them.  Somewhat dingy inside, but the prices are cheap for Vegas, and the service is good."}
{"text":"I saw the reviews and decided to try it out.  Breakfast was excellent.  We had the chicken and waffles, pancakes and a chorizo skillet.  The food came out fairly fast.  The waiter was the only one bland of this experience.  Not rude, but not great.  Overall great place for breakfast.  If we are in Las Vegas again, we will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Beautiful fairly new location. Used to be a Marie Callendars. Menu is huge with great breakfast selections. Prices are reasonable. Shared a breakfast as portions were large. Good was good; eggs, French toast and ham."}
{"text":"My very first blueberry hill experience happened here! My husband and I were house hunting for our PCS to Nevada, and I kept saying \"I wanna go there! It looks good\" we went one night   I got the pigs in a blanket, my husband had the biscuits a and gravy.  This is a real gem, always crowded with airmen and their families :)   Return factor: Yes, not to this location though, we don't live near it."}
{"text":"Love this place! My husband and I enjoy breakfast around the clock, and when I need some big fluffy pancakes, I head here! I love this place!  Very affordable, generous portions, large menu!"}
{"text":"My last review for delivery was bad, this one is for dining in. Let me start by saying the Blueberry Hill on Decatur at Charleston is great, with great service. But this Flamingo/Decatur location is totally different.  The service was so bad, really inattentive and slow, the food was good, but not great. Just go another 15 minutes to the Charleston location, it's way worth it."}
{"text":"I came here with my Mom and Grandma, when they came to visit. I had the biscuits and gravy with a side of bacon, which was amazing. Everything is obviously made from scratch. My Grandma got the banana pancakes with some pecan prailine topping, and even though when it came to she said it was too much food.... she ate it all. (With a little help) I forget what my mom got, but she was very happy with hers too. Plus the bill was under $40. And they had hazelnut creamer,which made us both happy.  We were sat pretty fast, faster than we expected since the place was busy. The wait staff was slammed but nice, they seemed to run like a well oiled machine. Our food came quicly too.  We did see lots of the tables ordering the hot chocolate. Piled up with whip cream and topped with a cookie. So, it seems like that's a thing to order. They also had homemade cakes and fudge, which we didn't try, but all looked good.   Afterwards we drove to Red Rock Canyon, which was a nice break for our feet, and so beautiful. Definitely made our Sunday."}
{"text":"Have you ever wondered if IHOP was ever a quality restaurant? Ever imagine that the original Denny's was a gem of a diner with food made from scratch and a loyal list of regulars who swear by the restaurant? Well please wonder no more and just please stop caring because both of those restaurant are garbage and if they were ever good they still wouldn't match up to Blueberry Hill.  I got tipped off to this restaurant when I showed up 3hrs early at Simon's highly overpriced brunch and needed food immediatly! The valet at Palms Place told me to check out Blueberry Hill and off I went. Starting out the place looks like a typical diner, old lady waitresses, poorly dressed slobs and maybe some folks that just got out of church. The thing is the menu is done very well and is full of imagination. I was torn between three choices, chicken and waffles, apple chicken sausage and waffles or chicken sweet potato waffles. I went with my servers recommendation and chose the apple chicken sausage waffle and a side of eggs.  The food in a word: fantastic! They use Aidells sausage which is typically $7 a pack at the grocery store and a strong sign they are shooting for quality instead of using bullshit like most places (ie. Dennys/IHOP). The waffles topped with little cinnamon and accompanied with an excellent sweet whipped butter was great. The sausage was excellent and perfectly matched the waffle. The eggs while simply scrambled and served on a plate were also very solid, they chose to cook them in butter adding an extra kick that stepped up the eggs from typical diner expectations. The meal was $10.50, $7.99 for the waffle and 1.87 for the eggs and was a great value. I had to tip her 50% simply because it was a better breakfast than almost anywhere in Vegas.  4/5 stars because service is warm but overall ok and the decor is very early 80's pastel which kind of pissed me off."}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday morning around 9 AM no wait, my daughter and I ordered omelettes. The waitress was really nice and explain that all omelettes are four eggs which was really big for my daughter. She suggested that she order off the kids menu which was made with only two eggs and still comes with 2 large pancakes. My husband ordered two eggs bacon, potatoes and toast. All of the food was very tasty and very good. The wait for the food was a little long but given that they make everything from scratch it's expected. My coffee cup never reach the bottom which was nice, so I was always getting served hot coffee. I would come back to try there dinner next time I am in town."}
{"text":"Still the best place for breakfast around - reasonable prices, classic freshly prepared breakfasts, sassy waitresses who keep your coffee full.  If there's just two of you and theres a line, so if you can sit at the counter - then you get to watch all the awesome dishes come flying out of the window."}
{"text":"The best hash-slingin, short order diner in Vegas IMO.  This is a regular stop for us for breakfast on every visit to Vegas to get away from the Stripinsanity - good coffee, great food, sassy, seasoned waitresses (they dont start up with you unless you start up with them!), and just an all-around good experience.  I usually get the cornedbeef hash with eggs, the wife gets the fabulous four-cheese crepes, the menu is long & varied with many southwestern-inspired variations.   If you're tired of the swill being slopped out in the overpriced casino breakfast buffets try this place. Last visit 1/31/10 Bill B"}
{"text":"Blueberry Hill is not the same as I remember. The inside was clean from what I could see (I know this was an issue in other reviews.) I had French toast (which I have been having for like 20 years) and it was soggy. Our waitress was very friendly and we ate late at night. They have a happy hour menu for lower prices after 11. My hubs had the pancakes and ham. He said they were just ok too. Don't know if I will be back."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast early in the morning . Christina is an awesome server , who will make you laugh. Eggs are always cooked perfectly. A little on the pricey side , but a great spot to get some good food."}
{"text":"My friends and I used to eat at the Blueberry Hill on Flamingo for years so, I was glad to see this location right next to my nephew's condo. We got right in at 8am on Sunday, which was great because there was 9 of us. One of my nephew's and I had the Short Stack with 3 sausage and I really, really liked it.  The pancakes were fluffy and the sausage were cooked perfect. I still could not finish the Short Stack. The pancakes are so big. My hubby got the Blueberry Pancakes with bacon and scrambled eggs. He loved it, the bacon was crispy and the scrambled eggs were fluffy. There were blueberries inside the pancakes as well as blueberry compote poured over the top. My niece got the Fresh Fruit Crepes and enjoyed them. One of my nephew's got the Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs. It was all gone before I could ask him how it was. I must have been yummy. My sister got the Waitress Special with Pancakes, which was yummy. The kids ordered Smiley Face Pancakes which come with 2 pancakes and those suckers are big! We should've only ordered one and had them split the 2 pancakes."}
{"text":"Blueberry Hill is one of those places that has a few really good items (like their Coconut Cream Pie) and the usual array of breakfast food.    Recently, they've changed their menu up a bit and have a few new selections that look really good that I haven't had the chance to try.  This last time I visited I had a pork fritter dinner.  Okay, so even the server couldn't tell me what was in the pork fritter exactly, but it was pretty darn tasty.  I know, it's a breakfast place...I should probably have ordered breakfast.  The service at this particular location is a little hit and miss.  You can tell who the regulars are as they occupy the majority of the server's time.  Once you get your order in, the wait for your food to come is average but getting your beverage refilled may be a little difficult if you're the shy type.  Overall, not a bad place to go and definitely worth the drive from the strip to save a little extra for that slot machine that keeps winking at you on your way to your room."}
{"text":"Came in on a busy Saturday morning and the service was great!  Couldn't have been any better or faster.   Omelets are nice and fluffy.   Everything is made from scratch and it tastes like it.  Pancakes are the best anywhere.  Best breakfast place I have been to ever.  Can't wait for lunch!"}
{"text":"Great food and being a senior I love the specials. Service is always great. Their desserts are also awesome."}
{"text":"Customer service was great! Thanks to Margarita. We shared the chicken fajita omelette with pancakes and a side of potatoes"}
{"text":"I just want to start off by saying THIS IS MY NEW FAVORITE BREAKFAST PLACE IN VEGAS. Omg. Cheap prices. Great food. Fast and friendly service. I literally could not think of anything that this place can improve on. It was packed but we were seated in like 5 minutes. The server was super nice and spoke both English and Spanish. My 2 parents and sister all got full plates of food, I mean pancakes and eggs and bacon and huevos rancheros and chilaquiles and their total was $28. Such a good deal! I will always come back to this place."}
{"text":"I was kinda horrified walking in as the tables were not properly cleaned.  At my table there were blobs of butter leftover from other people on the table,  napkin holder etc.  Menu was dirty.  Service was slow even though there weren't many people there.  I left without ordering based on the lack of cleanliness."}
{"text":"We love this place. The manager came around to see if all was good. I had the crepes, the very best evere. We had great service from the moment we walked in the door. The greeter kept us informed on the wait.  It was a full house but that didn't interfere with food or service. We will be back."}
{"text":"Great food, a little pricier than most breakfast places but still amazing. There are a few locations in LV so that makes it convenient as well. A MUST."}
{"text":"What can one really say about Blueberry Hill, the place is an institution in the world of breakfast restaurants...and deservedly so.  The menu items are nicely varied, the portions plentiful and the service good.  About once per month I make the 20 minute trek in the morning to enjoy a few breakfast standards and am never disappointed.  I wish they'd put one in Henderson and save me a little time on the road - maybe somewhere on Sunset would be nice."}
{"text":"I come to Vegas once a year and I come here for breakfast all the time and it is amazing to know that my server Stephanie knows my order all the time and it is always great.  I would recommend this place to everyone and you musk ask for her as a server.  Wow!"}
{"text":"Breakfast is GREAT!!!  Pancakes and French Toast AMAZING !! Service is GREAT.. Im going up in a week"}
{"text":"This is an excellent place to get breakfast or lunch!! There is a huge menu and food quality is good. They will take all substitutions which I love and the staff is very friendly!! Sometimes like any other place the service can be slow but overall I like this place for its choices and food. I come here often and I will continue to!"}
{"text":"Good food. Huge portions. Pancakes were very fluffy and good, not too heavy. Place was clean and service was quick for as busy as it was."}
{"text":"We love this place!!! Great food and family friendly staff!!! We eat here at least once a week and totally awesome for being 24 hours"}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service  Got coffee and tasty food  Fresh egg Great French toast"}
{"text":"Wanted a good breakfast that was not a buffet or from the hotel and this fit the bill perfectly. We highly recommend!!! The pancakes are a must have, and the bacon was nice and crispy. Nothing like spending a night on the strip and recovering with breakfast here in the morning."}
{"text":"You must get the biscuits and gravy, I insist! Biscuits so light and fluffy with delicious sausage gravy.  Get it as a side for only $3.99. The coffee here is really good too and comes in cute old-timey diner mugs.  My husband says the pancakes were the BEST - very hard to find really good pancakes these days!  My Eggs Benedict Florentine was delicous (because I added bacon of course) with perfectly poached eggs.   Every time we come to Vegas, we HAVE to have breakfast at Blueberry Hill.  It's delicious, satisfying and incredibly affordable!"}
{"text":"Open 24 hours - breakfast all day!  When you want to get away from the strip and enjoy a good old fashioned diner, complete with hot coffee and a wonderful waitress who calls you honey and sweetheart, this is the place!! We got friendly, warm service from Debbie who kept our coffee mugs filled to the brim. Eggs Florentine ($7.99) and Chicken Fried Steak ($11.29) were both satisfying and delicious.   This place was so good, we also stopped there on our way out of town. I had the Four Cheese French Toast with fresh fruit ($9.79) with a side of bacon ($3.19). Luckily I got the icing on the side otherwise it would have been way too sweet!  Without the icing, it was perfect!  Next time I'm getting the Monte Cristo Sandwich ($8.89), which I somehow missed on the giant menu....twice!"}
{"text":"Lot's of hype for this place. On par with Denny's. Meh."}
{"text":"Short and simple: the food was amazing and huge portioned, and the staff were very friendly. Sometimes too friendly in an amusing way. Go. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Don't order the breakfast burrito. The rice is dry, and the beans are served cold. I asked for sausage inside; either they forgot or they thought they were being sneaky and tried to trick me with potato skins. The orange sauce overtop was just kinda weird. Overall not a satisfying meal.   However, my father ordered the chicken noodle soup and that was fantastic. The service is good and the staff are friendly, so they still get four stars. Their breakfast foods are very tasty. Lesson of the day: don't order Mexican food at a diner."}
{"text":"The Eggs Benedict is just delicious. Their hash browns are unique and also very tasty."}
{"text":"\"I found my thrill, on Blueberry Hill...\" Not really but Richie Cunningham singing that on \"Happy Days\" made me giggle as a little kid. The food here makes me happy in a nostalgic way, too.   Quite reminiscent of NY diner food, open 24/7: I've been a fan since my office was walking distance years ago. Great place to go for breakfast all day, or when you have a group who can't agree on a specific cuisine, or breakfast, lunch, or dinner, for that matter, etc.   Cheesy, well-worn and outdated decor is alright when you are being served fluffy pancakes, crisp waffles, good burgers, AOk soups and tasty sammies by cheerful wait staff. Exactly what it is supposed to be: comfort food whenever you want it. My folks frequent the Decatur location, and I've found them consistently good, too. The strawberry malted (extra thick, with blender cup on side) always makes me happy = do it!   * if you order sammies that come with mayo: 'on the side' is a good call here, they slather it on (blech ;) *  ** they can deliver true, soft scrambled eggs = why can't everyone?!?! **  *** 24/7 just about anything you could order in a diner on E Coast ***   **** portions trend gargantuan; bake fresh daily muffins & desserts ****   ***** Senior discounts, kids menu, two daily specials (at least) I heart the beer battered cod on Fridays *****   Dunno why my photos aren't linking, but they're in here, amongst the gallery: Turkey Club, Clam Chowda & curly fries ;)"}
{"text":"portion sizes are enormous...service is standard at best...the variety was great...everyone at the table had something different and it was all excellent"}
{"text":"Early morning brunch craving and we ended up at this location. I and my friends where overwhelmed by there large menu. I ordered the breaded chicken and two eggs. I was served with a big breaded chicken breast, eggs, breads, gravy and hashbrown. It was yummy and filling. The portion size for the price is great. I will visit this location once again before leaving."}
{"text":"Blueberry Hill makes me laugh because of a conversation my friend once heard between a man and two...uh...ladies of the evening that were seated behind her at 2 AM at one of their fine dining establishments.  \"Girl, your breath smells like goat MEAT!\" said the man, to which one of the women retorted, \"I'm gonna punch you in the NECK!\"  That secondhand exchange is why Blueberry Hill gets 2 stars, otherwise it would be 1.  Dingy and with poor service, not even their limp, 'specialty' pancakes can make up for the horridness of the rest of their menu.  Take me to Denny's, please!"}
{"text":"Top 5 favorite breakfast places in Vegas for Me. In my opinion, they have the best, simple home made buttermilk pancakes. The atmosphere is kind of dainty and old, but the food both breakfast and lunch definitely makes up for it."}
{"text":"Excellent.  Not fancy but nice down home ambiance.  Food was generous and cooked perfect.  Service was quick and prices are very resonable.  Will visit this place again for sure."}
{"text":"Blueberry is a must every time my family comes to visit from California they have to go eat at Blueberry everything is delicious and yummy there is never bad service and it's always fast to be seated"}
{"text":"Did a yelp search looking for a good breakfast place for my family and did we ever.   Healthy portions, reasonable prices, great service, and very tasty.  Would come here again."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible. Been here so many times in my life. Dried out ham steak. Eggs not cooked to right temp. HAIR ON TOAST. Asked to speak to the manager. She says she apologies we came in the middle of shift change?    Asked her what she could comp, since we got the toast to egg with our eggs and she starts laughing at me under her breathe saying \"I don't know what you want me to do for you honey\".   I work in the service industry!!!  This is not how you treat guests!!!!  Been coming here since I was a kid but after being treated this way, I'm good.   Here is also a picture of her sitting RIGHT NEXT TO THE REGISTER when we paid for the waffle and half of my boyfriends food. She was shaking her head and filling her mouth with food right in the entrance.  So unfortunate."}
{"text":"Never walk away hungry. Great food good service have eaten here numerous time always busy has a great dinner atmosphere.  Don't go if you're expecting fine dining it's a dinner.   Raven was great server..."}
{"text":"I've lived in Vegas for nearly four years now and have always wondered if Blueberry Hill was well, legit! I drive past it all the time and it never dawned on me that this place might in fact be good! Breakfast, lunch, and dinner is offered here and this place is definitely a mom-and-pop style diner that locals as well as tourists enjoy. It's a good option for tourists who are looking to dine off of the Strip. Plus, it's open 24 hours!  I convinced my family to come here one night for a late dinner and after our experience, I'm still not sure if I'm a fan or not. The menu is very expansive and well designed. The tabs make it easy to flip through the different categories.   I ordered the Blueberry Hill-Style Monte Cristo Sandwich- Turkey and ham smothered with Swiss cheese, grilled on French toast bread that apparently isn't deep-fried or breaded. First of all, the serving sizes at Blueberry Hill are huge! My sandwich looked overwhelming and was packed with meat. I mean PACKED! There was so much turkey and ham that it was hard to take a bite! I definitely was not able to finish my meal, especially with the thick French toast. It was good, but I don't think I would order this again because after a few bites, the taste became old.  My dad ordered the Downhome Dixie Meatloaf which also seemed to be a bit overwhelming. It looked extremely rich, but he enjoyed it. My mom however, was not satisfied with her steak and eggs because it was cooked too long. It was on the dry side, but our waitress was very apologetic and compensated for her meal.  The customer service was friendly, but I feel like they were understaffed at the time. There were only two waitresses on shift during our visit and although it was 9 o'clock at night, I felt as if they should've been more prepared as more guests started to flow into the diner.  I'll probably have to try it one more time to completely make up my mind. The breakfast menu looks tempting!"}
{"text":"this place in vegas is the best for breakfast. I tried the chicken waffle the chicken wasn't try very tender. they have a big menu selection and everything I order there was Good"}
{"text":"A fantastic 24 Hour restaurant that has everything.  I love their make-your-own omlettes. Spinach, mushroom, and tomato is my favorite.   Their Mexican food is better than most Mexican restaurants and their deserts are dangerous at 3am!"}
{"text":"When I'm looking for an little extra TLC when eating out, this is the place where waitresses  treat you like a part of the family.  Excellent food, huge portions and fast service.  Love their Blueberry pancakes!"}
{"text":"Horrible Service. The manager was so busy sitting around laughing and playing with his employees that he forgot to run the Restaurant. 8 employees sitting around doing noting. There was one other table besides ours. Brought two meals out. 10 minutes later brought another meal out. 10 minutes later after everyone was done eating they brought out our last meal. Horrible management."}
{"text":"Coffee cup cracked, jelly packet sliced open, unclean, nasty grill cleaner taste to hash browns.... Gone way down hill in the last year:-("}
{"text":"Stopped by for something quick. The wait was short and the service was quick. I ordered the eggs benedict with potatoes. The potatoes could've been fresher but other than that everything was good. I will probably be back!"}
{"text":"I Like blueberry hill for their variety menu of breakfast, lunch, or dinner.  This location is pretty new. Located on the Corner of Flamingo/Decature. I usually get the breaded pork chop dinner which is my favorite.  I ventured to the pasta section and that spaghetti and meatballs were calling my name.   I ended up with the italian meatloaf because it came with Spaghetti!  for just $3 and some change you can add a drink, Soup or Salad, and dessert.  Hell yeah!!   The dish was Plentiful.  The Spaghetti was excellent.  The meatlof was really good but I didn't care for the sweetness of the marinara sauce they put on the meatloaf.   For dessert I the Reeses pieces Cheese cake. Our Server was excellent!"}
{"text":"Good food and huge portion.  One of the family restaurants.  Nothing special other than the portion."}
{"text":"I decided to write a review after multiple visits. I can honestly say this is my favorite go-to breakfast eatery. It is also open 24 hours, so if you have any midnight muchies, i recommend trying this place out. The pancakes are delectable, and I truly believe this place is 100 times better than Dennys and IHOP combined. If you are really hungry try the chicken fried steak and a side of pancakes, yes a SIDE of pancakes. If you just want pancakes, order any of the pancake specials or any omelette with a side of pancakes!  I absolutely love this location because of the ambiance.   The service is top-shelf!! I have never had any bad experience with any waiter, and believe me, they know the menu in and out. They are very friendly and make feel welcomed. Nothing bad to say about the service, theyre just pretty damn good at it.  Ambiance is very casual, especially at night (when no one is there).  Again, I never had a bad experience at any of these restaurants and I stick to my opinion!"}
{"text":"Very crowded location, but seems like turnover is relatively quick.  Service was pretty slow. We had to wait quite a while to get our order in.  Not enough wait staff for volume of customers.  Menu itself was huge.   I settled on the mexican pepper steak.  Meat was kind of flavorless but tender.  Salsa had a nice zing and better than i thought.  Rice was like out of a box and the beans were like out of a can. Flavors were ok.  I had some of my friends rocky road pancakes and it was decent.  Good flavor but texture was lacking.  Overall ok visit but I think there are better breakfast places in Vegas to choose from."}
{"text":"This location is beautiful and very spacious. The interior designing is thoughtful and welcoming. I was surprised to see so many different areas within one restaurant. Service was great, although the food came out warm, not hot."}
{"text":"Great place to get a tasty breakfast at all hours of the night. Not the best of crowds late at night. But I would recommend this place much better then going to a chain restaurant. Staff is good; but depends on the days you go."}
{"text":"This place always offers good food... But the only thing missing is the lack of good customer service when we walked in... A guy offered coffee and we said yes and next thing you know he's mopping the floor in the other side. It wasnt until another waitress named Andrea came and served us. She was nice. The food was great! Their toast amazing.... Oh and not to mention my husband and i love the music they always play here..:)"}
{"text":"This place is horrible! We originally went to one on the other side of town and it was great. Stay away from this location! The restaurant is dirty! There was puke in the restroom hallway that sat there for an hour. Our pancakes were burnt and most of us got sick shortly after eating our food. This experience ruined it for me to return to any of the Bluberry Hill Restaurants."}
{"text":"Was STARVING when we hit Blueberry HIll for breaky this AM, but that is not why I loved it and why I'm giving them four stars.  This is my third visit to this location and every time the food has been good and the service decent.  This was no exception.  The service was friendly, but not awesome, but they have this TREMENDOUS menu.  Seriously, it's huge and the food is delicious.  This time I stepped away from my usual fried egg and toast breakfast and ordered the Full House.  This came with 2 eggs, 2 slices of bacon, 2 sausage links and two crepes.   The crepes are filled with a cheese mixture and a hot fruit compote.  I'm not a big fan of fruit in my food, especially mushy sweetened fruit, but I was hoping maybe they had orange or peach.  No, strawberry, blueberry or apple.  While I normally would never order something with strawberries in it (I like 'em fresh, but not fake flavored stuff), I went with the strawberry, which really made our waitress happy, by the way.  I'm glad I did because these crepes were DEEEELISH!  Seriously good.  My scrambled eggs were perfectly cooked and perfectly salted.  The bacon was crispy and the sausage flavorful.  I LOVED my meal.  My friend ordered the same thing only with blueberry and she loved it, too.  The husband ordered the turkey club sandwich and the bread came out perfectly lightly toasted and he enjoyed his food.  My friend picked up the check, but I think it was about $30 for the three meals and one iced tea. Not coffee shop CHEAP, but affordable and with the great food, a total value.  Pretty much you can get almost anything you can imagine to eat here.  It exceeded my expectations for a coffee shop which is why I am a fan and will be back!  WHAT CAN THEY DO TO GET FIVE STARS? ~UPDATE THE HECK OUT OF IT.  The truth is that this place is old.  The building is old, the furniture is old, the dishes are old, the menus are old.  THE BATHROOMS ARE OLD.  Yeah, it's sort of part of it's charm and of course if they DID update it the prices would go up, but it can't get a five star rating as is."}
{"text":"I love me some Blueberry Hill! This place is unexpectedly delicious and one of my favorite places to grab a huge American diner style breakfast.  Casual and unpretentious, this place is a gathering spot for friends and family. There's something for everyone and they're open 24/hr too! The menu has a nice selection of breakfast, lunch, dinner & desserts to choose from and even offers specials scattered about. There is also no such thing as small portions here - everything is huge! This place is bustling during weekend breakfast hours, but they seem to have a handle on large crowds; they offer prompt service and we never have to wait too long for our food.   They make my favorite pancakes in town! Huge, fluffy and insanely buttery! I thought Du-Par's had the best pancakes in Vegas, but this one is right up there alongside it! The bacon is crispy, plus the eggs are jumbo sized and always cooked to perfection! The only items that I would skip are the crepes and the hash browns (I've had better.)   Blueberry Hill is a reliable neighborhood staple. Ditch IHOP/Denny's and head on over!"}
{"text":"Very friendly and efficient team. The food was very good as well. Love going to Small Businesses they vs Corporate America Chains."}
{"text":"Great place!  Glad we had a chance to eat here  Kids had the strawberry pancakes.  They loved them.  I had the chilaquiles and my wife ordered the potato pancakes.  Service was great.  Very friendly, even though they were busy."}
{"text":"I had breakfast here last week. I had the 4 aces - 2 sausage links, 2 pieces of bacon, 2 eggs, and 2 pancakes. I asked for more bacon instead of pancakes. The waitress was very accommodating. The bacon was great quality. My friend had the same dish but had pancakes. The pancakes were very fluffy and homemade. She really enjoyed them.   Great place for breakfast"}
{"text":"Lots of food, price was fair. Very busy place."}
{"text":"By far, one of the best places I've eaten breakfast in the state of Nevada.   My sister has been living out in Vegas for the past few years and wanted to take me around to a few good eateries. Our first stop on a quiet Friday morning was Blueberry Hill. We showed up a little after 11AM and the crowd seemed sparse. Because of this, our group was taken immediately to a comfy window booth, had our menus handed to us and drink orders taken. Within minutes our coffees and water arrived.. all positives so far.  We were given a couple more minutes (as requested) to look over the menu, which had a LOT going on. The prices were fair, ranging from low eggs and bacon at around $4 to steak and eggs pushing $12. Although the place is called 'Blueberry Hill', I didn't feel the need to try something with blueberries or that sauce in it. I'm a HUGE fan of pancakes, but not at all with the dessert like toppings. Just butter and syrup please.  I'm cool with the basics, so I grabbed the 1-2-3 Biscuit Special; 3 pieces of crispy bacon, over-easy eggs and they generously gave me 2 biscuits and gravy (as opposed to one). For a side to share.. we grabbed 4 pieces of french toast.   ..When the food's good, no one speaks. The head nod is given with a little grin that holds a mouth full of food. This is what was happening and my stomach was truly thankful. I felt all giddy inside.. My body knew it was consuming breakfast up to par with some of the best and was preparing itself for a nap already.   The biscuits and gravy were out of this world. Gravy was warm with bits and pieces of sausage in it and hints of pepper. The biscuits were nice n' fluffly, lightly lathered with butter and had a light crispness around the edges. The French toast was out of this world.. it was almost equivalent to eating donuts.. doughy, buttered and dusted with sugar.. syrup was practically not needed for these things. I have a feeling they were fried somehow.. and I'm not complaining 'bout it one bit! Dip that crispy bacon into egg yolk and let it run for the WIN. (Crowd cheers)  It didn't seem too packed in the customer department at this hour. Perhaps that's the reason we were able to get such prompt and friendly service along with a great meal. Satisfied? Yes."}
{"text":"Pretty typical dinner food.  Not bad by any means. Needs updating.   Friendly server but they were chatty at the counter when we were trying to pay and left us standing there."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place for breakfast before heading to the airport to fly home. The food was good, the service was good and friendly. The quantities are large, so we split a breakfast, which was enough for the both of us. This is a family style diner, so don't expect anything fancy, just a down home kind of place. We will go back if we return to Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try after hearing everyone say you must try it.  Friendly staff and great setup,  The food is great.  Great tasting omelets and pancakes are so good.  Cannot go wrong here with anything.  The menu is huge and everything is made fresh and great here."}
{"text":"Helpful hint to waitstaff, customers usually find it really insulting when you ignore them and serve people that were seated well after them first.  We finally walked out without ordering, as no one seemed interested in our patronage.  Two stars because at least the place was clean."}
{"text":"FOOD: The corn beef hash in the Irish Eggs Benedict is NOT  home or fresh made. It is unnervingly comparable to beef flavored cat food in appearance and texture (with a fork, I did not eat it....nor the cat food needed to make a true comparison, but you get the point). Maybe pancakes and waffles would have been a safer choice.  SERVICE: Do not act or look like a NON-REGULAR. You will be generally ignored by the servers (older lady with uber classy hand tat).  AMBIANCE: Meh, been in worse, seen better. Bathroom was clean. The parking is limited to a few spots out front, and then you get to share with the adjacent motel. For North Vegas, I've parked in better, and a little bit worse..."}
{"text":"Everything here is excellent, massive, affordable and delicious!!! I wish we had this in LA!!!! Pretty much everything is shareable let's just put it that way"}
{"text":"My only wish is that I could have kept on eating. This was the first stop after landing in Vegas early one Saturday morning. Pancakes were on point! The rest of my breakfast of the standard bacon, eggs & potatoes were also good, but the pancakes were so good. I'm not even a huge pancake lover, but these were fluffy and creamy, fresh and hot. I wish I could have had more, but could barely get through a portion of the short stack (3). Service was slow, our waitress was very forgetful. The busser was great though. Coffee was also good. For a greasy spoon type of diner, this is a great place to go. They had all kinds of pies and cakes they bake there in a case that looked pretty good and fancy too. I will definitely be back. I hope all their locations are just as good."}
{"text":"There are several of these in town. I got the French toast and it was delicious at two different locations. Same with the hot chocolate and this is the only place I have been too where they give you a cookie with it. Service was fast, the waitress was friendly, helpful and smiling. Which sounds minute but nowadays so many people seem to hate their job.   Good food, good prices, good service. I plan to go back anytime I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"The wait was about 15 minutes for a early morning Saturday. Which isn't bad for a good restaurant with inexpensive prices. Staff is sweet and close to our hotel Vdara. I'm happy I came here and doesn't only 12 bucks for my meal.  At Vdara  I would have spent 28 bucks! Will come back next time we are in vegas!"}
{"text":"My work all pitched in and we got some Oreo pancakes.... I will never not get them when I come here again. Their so good. Even without the syrup. Some parts of it were a tiny bit starchy, but it's really delicious. You get 4 oreo pancakes for $8.50!!!!!"}
{"text":"I went to this place off the strip and it was busy. We waited for a short time before seated. The menu has a large selection of breakfast selections. I have to say the portions were a good size and tasted great. Great value and will definitely return on our next Vegas visit."}
{"text":"I had breakfast this morning, Saturday, with my daughter at this Blueberry Hill. The food was great, waffle with fruit, eggs & bacon.  The waffle had a very good flavor, eggs cooked perfectly & bacon crispy. I couldn't ask for more. My daughters meal was just as good.  The waitress, Linda H. did an excellent job especially making sure out coffee was kept hot & full. I will definitely eat here again. The restaurant was full when we came & full when we left but the service was great."}
{"text":"My first time here was 4 years ago on a visit to Las Vegas. Unfortunately I discovered this little piece of breakfast heaven on our last day there. This time, on my week long visit to Vegas again, I made it a point to eat here almost every morning! This is the only place where I've ever overdosed on pancakes! Sometimes I wish there were a Blueberry Hill near my home here in NJ. But at the same time I'm glad there isn't one, or I'd weigh about 500 lbs. Everything here was excellent! This has now become my new MUST go-to, when in the Vegas area."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, just like every other review states it. Portions are enormous.  Waiters are nice. Food is very tasty."}
{"text":"The food is always great but I love ice tea and its never good I always have to get hot tea and 2 cups of ice and make my own ice tea. I hope the new one that's opening on flamingo knows how to make ice tea."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is great comfort food, and they have a huge variety! Staff is very patient and accommodating. We always come here when visiting Vegas. All generations of the family love it from the Oreo pancakes to the liver and onions. Don't forget the great desserts!"}
{"text":"We found this restaurant on Yelp. We were at the Area 51 Museum and wanted something coffee shop feeling. Bingo! Blueberry Hill Family restaurant hit the spot. The place was packed but we were seated quickly. We had some families with wild, misbehaving children around, so that was not as desirable, but not the restaurants fault.  The place was clean, the service was prompt and friendly. Our food came out relatively fast and tasted yummy. Left there feeling full, and happy. Prices were reasonable. We enjoyed our meal and would go there again.  Oh, My husband had coffee and he thought it was really good!"}
{"text":"1st time eating here and I will be honest don't think I'll ever be back. The server Stephanie made me feel very rushed. Their menu is huge so I wanted to see what they all had. She was very short with us and was not polite at all. When we were taken to our table the gentlemen acted as If he didn't want to seat us because our other half of our party (2 people) were outside because there was no place to sit or stand while waiting inside. Thumbs down to this place on their customer service."}
{"text":"The service was decent. The food okay. It comes in a good portion! Don't worry about not getting full! I ordered the half pound bacon burger and it didn't come on a hamburger bun it came on this roll and I didn't like it. The meat was smaller than the bread so I had to rip off/bite into the bread for a bit to actually get to the meat it was kinda dumb. The people were nice and it wasn't super expensive. It was decent priced. I'd come again, but I wouldn't order the same thing."}
{"text":"This place was good!  The hash browns were perfect and the server was fast and friendly.  Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"It's sad to say but good quality diners are disappearing and so is that family feel that goes with it (not to mention the food). This is one of those places that has all the trimmings and details that make it all work, from friendly staff, great food that is not massed produced and extremely reasonable prices. You can get any plate the way you want it and they make every effort to keep the customers happy which would explain the long line in the mornings. Can't say enough about it except that you need to come try it, experience it and in some cases, cure that Vegas hangover with some great food."}
{"text":"Great place for homestyle and basic breakfast! It's like a Denny's on crack!"}
{"text":"This is the ONLY Blueberry Hill that I go to. I always go on Saturday mornings for breakfast but no matter what time it is, the wait staff is nice and the food is sooooo yummy! I drive 15 minutes just to eat at this location!"}
{"text":"We love this place, so yummy. Our waitress Margarita was sooooo friendly and sweet. Our food as always is divine!"}
{"text":"Blueberry Hill is by no means a dining destination and still I have chosen it for my 600th review. In fact, I'd say the food here is forgettable at best. And yet I give the Hill five stars because of the absolutely stellar treatment they give my elderly grandparents. My grandma and grandpa eat here at least once a week; they take a lot of their food home as leftovers and they have a variety of special requests. Yet, none of this seems to faze the friendly folks at Blueberry Hill (who greet my grandparents by name and know which tables they like, and make sure to seat them there). Every appeal is met with a smile, which I have seen firsthand when I visit the restaurant with my grandparents on trips back home.   It warms my heart every time I walk in this place. So many people treat older folks with disdain, I'm glad this establishment doesn't."}
{"text":"I was waiting on a friend to finish her errands so I stopped in by myself. I opened the menu and saw the coconut honey chicken and waffles. That's all I needed to see! So good! Flavorful, crunchy and sweet, but not too sweet! The coffee kept coming and the server was great! I will be back!"}
{"text":"As far as diners go, this place was not bad. Service was a little suspect, but I was there on a Monday afternoon so keep that in mind."}
{"text":"From 3/24/16 Finally decided to try Blueberry Hill, after hearing good things about this restaurant! When you walk in you feel like you're in a time warp in a good way, it reminds me of what and old school diner should look like. There is a cake carousel by the hostess station which was tempting but probably not a good idea considering all the calories we were about to consume.  We were seated, out server was awesome can't remember her name, though. We placed our order, I got blueberry pancakes with a side of bacon. It took a bit for our food to come out, but that might be because it was packed. However, when our food came out it was tasty so I was happy.  I like this place and plan on coming back."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner with my grandparents a long time ago.  We really enjoyed our visit.  There weren't many people there, and the waitress was very kind.  We had a huge meal and dessert afterwards.  It was a fun place for us to go during our stay."}
{"text":"The food was decent, however, my daughter saw a waitress use the restroom and not wash her hands after. I also saw the cook behind the counter shoving eggs in his mouth with his hands. Absolutely disgusting! Had we of saw this before we ate we would have walked out. Just wanted to forewarn everyone."}
{"text":"Clean restaurant! My boyfriend and I came in to eat around 1:00am on Thursday morning. One waitress working-holding it down. Doing a great job but didn't say her name or have a name tag. I ordered 2 eggs, hashbrowns, sausage, biscuit & gravy AND chocolate Oreo pancakes.  Everything was scrumptious but my eyes were bigger than my stomach.  Big portions! Perfect for family size or take home. This was my first time.  I usually go to IHOP but I will be returning soon. (My boyfriend left satisfied as well)"}
{"text":"This is as close as I can find to an east coast diner. The menu is expansive and the food is always pretty good.  I don't think I've every had anything bad.  I've had some mediocre food, and some fantastic food - so we keep going back.  It's also a great place in my neighborhood for breakfast if you don't want to go the casino route.    My new favorite is the Irish Benedict.  Corned beef hash instead of Canadian bacon - aside from that, standard Bene.  Super-tasty.  I like to get that and my husband gets an omlette with pancakes... we then trade 1/2 of my hashbrowns for one of his pancakes.  Perfect meal - although it's really too much food.  That doesn't stop me from eating it.  The cinnamon pancakes and apple pancakes are also very good.  I've tried the omlettes, the waffles, the french toast - all good stuff.  I think I've had dinner/lunch there once or twice.  I don't remember what I had, so clearly not memorable.  But, we keep going back.  It's never been bad food.  Prices are good for the amount that you get."}
{"text":"Omg! I came here and I couldn't stop eating.. it was amazing , I ordered eggs Benedict with mushroom spinach and tomato think it's called Florentine eggs Benedict . They had an option of hash browns or potatoes . The potatoes were soooo good. The eggs Benedict was so good, everything was just amazing . My dad ordered ham and eggs with pancakes. The pancakes were fluffy with he perfect taste and I don't even like pancakes!!   My waiter was pretty terrible unfortunately . He continuously forgot my mom's order (he asked her 3x's) we waited 15 minutes for coffee when it's the first thing we ordered, and we didn't get our juice until our meal was almost over when we ordered it with the meal. It wasn't too busy. We came on a Saturday around 12 but the waiter was just not very attentive to our party. Other than that I am headed back to this place in the next couple weeks to see what else is on the menu!"}
{"text":"This is the place for a MIGHTY FINE blueberry pancake breakfast."}
{"text":"This will definitely be my go to breakfast place whenever in vegas.  While waiting in line at the hash hash a go go, i was busy yelping for an alternative. Based on the reviews and my love of the family owned little diners type we decided to get off the waiting list and head here instead. Absolutely loved it!!! I ordered the cinammon roll pancakes.  A little on the sweet side but its all good.  Cant wait for another trip back to vegas just so i can visit this place again. :)"}
{"text":"I drove too far from the hotel to this place for breakfast. The food was ok. There were hardly 4 tables on that morning but the food took over 40 minutes to arrive. My wife ordered egg white omelet but it came with all eggs. When asked about it, the waitress said that \"it is egg white but the spinach makes it look yellow!\"..... Come Again.... This is silly!"}
{"text":"I never knew the appeal to fresh blueberry pancakes until I had me some Blueberry Hill!  Oh my goodness breakfast will never be the same for me again.  It's Jan. 2, 2009 and I'm picking up my friend for breakfast before taking her to the airport for her flight back to SF.  Then I gotta head to work for an assuredly boring day.  But who cares about all that because there's nothing like a four egg omelet with ham and bacon (Texas Omelet) to get your day started.  Let's not forget the mound of hash browns and side of toast with jelly to complete the oh so satisfying meal.  Oh, and the portions were made for people who enjoy eating!    Although I'm not much of a pancake fan, I really, really enjoy breakfast food.  My friend did order the fresh blueberry pancakes after a couple of minutes of tortured decision making between blueberries or strawberries.  At first I thought it odd that her meal consisted of just the pancakes and nothing more.  Then I saw the pancakes and it all made sense.  4 large fluffy blueberry gooey pancakes was more than enough.  There was no way she was taking that home with her so she gave me 2 and all I gotta say is Mmmmmm Mmmm!  Hmmmm... dang.  I just made myself hungry and Blueberry Hill sounds really good right now."}
{"text":"Alright. Bluberry Hill Round 2.  The first time I ate at Blueberry Hill I was pleasantly surprised by the portions and yummyness of the food.  This time it was all about living up to expectations.  I went with my pops and bro.  We stopped by for some grub before dropping me off at work and they continued up to the Bay Area.  I think I over hyped Blueberry Hill to my bro because he wasn't nearly as estatic about the place as I was.  Then again, he ordered meat loaf.  WTF!  Order breakfast at a breakfast place damnit.  Though, I guess he's not much of a breakfast food person.  I, on the other hand, love breakfast food and I ordered the Wild West omelet.  Hm, I think I liked the Combo omelet I ordered last time better. Yet, the Wild West omelet definitely has a purpose.  It filled me up and had reserves for a small snack while I was at work.  I'm still enjoying Blueberry Hill but more testing much be done."}
{"text":"Well we were not disappointed by stopping by, after a being away for a long while. Hugo our service was gracious and pleasant to say the least. Food was fabulous, great new menu items."}
{"text":"I love this place for breakfast!!!  Multiple locations throughout Las Vegas. Most of the time it's seat yourself. Busy times you wait to be seated. The menus are on the tables. Best described as a regular Denny's/IHOP/diner. No decor, no wow factor, just tables and booths. The menus is huge! No seriously like 10 pages and everything is available 24/7.   The food is good. The cakes are homemade and have yummy buttercream frosting. The cakes are heavy and moist so you know there is nothing healthy, fat free, lite, or sugar free. My favorite is the strawberry cake.   The sandwiches are ok. The fries ok. The onion rings are beer battered. I had ordered the meatloaf sandwich that comes with cheese, country sausage gravy, onions on a roll. It's huge but I didn't like it that much. The meatloaf had ketchup on it and the mashing of ketchup and white gravy doesn't mix well to me.   Breakfast is where this place shines!!!! And like I said its 24/7. I love their breakfasts, the giant pancakes, the waffles, the country fried steak. I'm a happy camper with breakfast and cake here!!! I love crepes!!! And this time I had the crepe dealer with strawberry compote. Comes two crepes, eggs, choice of meat. And I added a side of hash browns. The fresh fruit crepe is really good too!!! I wish they had a savory crepe.   I've been here a bunch of times. If you go on Sunday make sure you get there early or afternoon the church crowd gives a huge wait to be seated."}
{"text":"This place is just a standard run of the mill diner.  Not too bad, nothing too special.  Local paper has it rated as the best diner in Las Vegas.  Those people need to get out of town more and try some 21st century diners.  It didn't help that we were in Vegas and at midnight their bar was closed...breakfast was good the next morning but they easily lost a star for the night before."}
{"text":"love their pancakes N waffles; compared to Ihop...."}
{"text":"My ham and cheese omelet came to me like scrambled eggs that I would make at home, kind of a mess.  I have a gluten allergy, so don't go here if you have a gluten allergy. They do not accommodate at all!   I ordered decaf tea. She brought the hot water but by the time she remembered, after prompting , to bring a decaf tea bag the hot water was not hot.  Bathrooms dirty."}
{"text":"Service was nice and quick and the food was delicious. We were there for breakfast and we left stuffed and satisfied!"}
{"text":"First time here and loved it. Comfort food!! Service is fast, food is great, and prices are low."}
{"text":"I am baffled I have not reviewed my FAVORITE breakfast spot.  This place is amazing!!!  Only bad thing is...it's a drive from my home, but WORTH it!.  Service: old school diner feel for me.  My husband and I usually eat at the counter and love hearing the older waitresses complain about the younger ones!  All in good fun, they all work well as a team.  Food: OMG!  Pancakes are the most mouthwatering, fluffy, delicious pancakes to ever touch my tongue.  There are no words to explain how truly perfect they are.  All breakfast items are big servings and I have never been disappointed.  Love that they have vanilla creamer for coffee, just ask for it.  Other: plenty of parking, an occasional wait if it's prime time breakfast time, paperboy at the door.  I feel like I haven't done this place justice with this review, but it's a definitely must try!!!!"}
{"text":"born and raised in new york.. this diner beats any ny diner i've been to. it's unfortunate, but true. get the pancakes."}
{"text":"Came into this restaurant based on the positive reviews.  It was good the first time, the second time, it was awful.    The server was nice but mostly invisible and,when I found a hair in my food, I could not find anyone to help me. Once,I showed the short black hair, (mine is long and brown and was pulled back with a hat), the management could have cared less.    In addition, there were dirty flies landing on us and the table but still no reaction, so I will never return.    I paid $12.60 for dried out crusted chicken and alfredo pasta with absolutely no flavor, it was like chewing my tongue. Casinos in Vegas have 2 for 1 sometimes as low as $9.99, so this place is out of line with their attitude and food.  This restaurant is two blocks from the Las Vegas strip and my entertainment was watching all shapes, sizes and colors of homeless people mill around this restaurant...a very sad show outside your windows."}
{"text":"Really good liver and onions!!! Very very clean.  Waitress was Exceptional. She suggested the senior Special for me which included a drink and dessert   Mashed potatoes were Real potatoes and some of the best I've had. Will definitely come here Again."}
{"text":"This place is on point. Great food and lightning fast service. I had the grilled pork chops and they were juicy and flavorful. The prices are good as well, about $14 for a solid breakfast including coffee.   Worth stopping by and checking out. I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"This was the first time I have eaten at Blueberry Hill. I ordered a two egg cheese and bacon omelette, and breakfast potatoes. I ordered a two egg cheese and bacon omelette, toast, and breakfast potatoes. I also had the pancakes. The pancakes were very yummy. Unfortunately they didn't use cheddar cheese in the omelette; they used american cheese (slice cheese). The breakfast potatoes were good and the service was great. In my opinion the prices were a bit high."}
{"text":"Blueberry Hill is a solid, dependable, if not necessarily great, family diner.  We got a sampling of normal breakfast dishes and sides, and were satisfied with them, but it was rather mediocre faire that I can honestly take or leave.  Take the biscuits and gravy, for instance.  The \"biscuits\" are gigantic, rectangular cakes of some sort of cooked and possibly also pan-fried not-quite-biscuit dough.  The sausage gravy was decent, but a lot of milk and flour and thin on the sausage.  This is pretty nominal example of such a dish compared to what one can cook at home in ten minutes, and the potatoes, pancakes, omelets, and other dishes we had were similarly okay-but-not-that-great."}
{"text":"This place was way better than I thought. I like the large menu and variety. This is good place to go after the clubbing on the strip. My friend got the chicken and waffles and I got the club sandwich. Both were excellent!"}
{"text":"Great Dinner. The service here is awesome and the food comes out very fast. It is cheap and you really cant beat it for places off the Strip. Great for Breakfast. Awesome Hash Browns!!"}
{"text":"This is the type of place you see in the old 50's movies.  It tries for that feel and it works.  Colorful inside, friendly service and great food made on site.    Just maybe too large of a menu and too many delicious choices!  It seemed when we were there, that most of the others were regulars.  Nice touch to know the neighbors eat there often as well.  Again, that old world charm and feel. The way it used to be.  Maybe.  Pancakes were huge, fluffy and delicious.  The Biscuits and gravy stick to your ribs and you walk away full without the Vegas sticker shock...  Waitress was fast, efficient and informative.  it was my GF's first time and she had many questions.  Again, too many choices for her to settle easily on one!"}
{"text":"Great coffee,  huge menu, huge portions!   I would definitely come back if I lived here!   Maybe next visit!"}
{"text":"Lost a valuable customer, came multiple times a week. i came here with my girlfriend last night and will never come again. You guys can ask the lady in the pink seating people last night why you guys lost valuable business. embarrassment.  god bless!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to come after a long night of debauchery. The waitresses are attentive and friendly during the graveyard (from what I've experienced so far) and the food come out relatively fast.  I've been here twice and have only ordered the biscuits and gravy so far (which is usually what I crave when I'm piss drunk) and it definitely hit the spot each time! The bacon is sooo good. The biscuits are huge and the eggs are cooked perfect each time.  I live close by, so I'll be making more appearances here....next time I'll have to try those oreo pancakes....OR maybe a slice a cake... I may just  head over there right now for a slice!"}
{"text":"Where there's Waffle House in the South, Denny's in California, Blueberry Hill has been a staple it seems in Nevada for their diner type food. When you walk in, it truly does remind you of walking into a Denny's, Norm's, or any other chain diner type establishment, though Blueberry Hill is a family owned operation. Our waitress was sweet, but firm, being from NY (as she was proud to tell us), she didn't put up with much, but got the job done and it was refreshing to be honest with you. She was there to do her job, and she was compensated (tip) with the service she provided. We sat on the counter as we were hungry and counter locations are normally a quick seat and serve, and you're on your way at most places.  I ordered the Texas Omelette which is an omelette topped with Texas chili, American cheese, and onions. It was accompanied with a stack of fluffy (3) pancakes and I ordered a side of biscuits and gravy on the side. The omelette was pretty good, but I enjoyed the pancakes and biscuits the most out of my meal on this visit. The biscuits and gravy had a nice sausage and pepper flavor without it being overly salty like most places. There was so much food I ended leaving half for my finacee to eat back at our hotel. On my next visit, I would be more than happy to give Blueberry another visit and try more items off their menu."}
{"text":"I would give less than one star if I could. My husband and I came here based on other yelper's reviews. The omelet said the bell peppers and onions were sautéed in butter first and they were crunchy and raw. The omelet wasn't so much an omelet as scrambled eggs with stuff thrown in. The has browns were more like hash whites and VERY greasy. The bacon's flavor was good but also greasy. Our waitress was very abrupt and rude. We weren't there during a busy time so I don't understand the attitude.  All I can say is BTDTNA  (been there done that never again)."}
{"text":"This place is always good and the waits have great attitudes. Always a win!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing!!  Just landed and was super hungry -we decided to get biscuit and gravy to start . Then I ordered a club sandwich and my husband got steak and eggs, everything was perfect and ALOT OF FOOD!! Plan on trying dinner"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and will probably be my last time. Our server Emma was the worst, she brought cold coffee, took forever to come and ask us if we needed refills and when we found plastic in our food she didn't bother apologizing. They took the plate to the cook and asked for a remake of the meal and it took almost 25 minutes just to remake a quesadilla! The remake of the meal was of no importance to anyone in the building. The manager was no where to be found because the server kept saying he wasn't available, my sister literally had to go get the manager herself when she saw him walking and even then he never apologized for the service we had or the plastic found in my nieces food. He was quick to just grab the check and tell us to have a good day which seemed like he just wanted us gone so he didn't have to deal with the issues we were bringing to his attention. Definitely not something I wanted to experience my first time at a restaurant but now I know where not to go."}
{"text":"No.   Hair on the table. Mold in the jam. Waitress response, \"oh, sorry\" and walked away. Wtf? Potatoes were under cooked and so were the eggs. Left most of the food on the table. I wouldn't recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"We make it a point to dine at Blueberry Hill Family Restaurant when we are in Vegas, and in fact, this was our first \"in\" and last \"out\" stop on this trip.  The coffee is unique, wonderful and never ending-really good coffee!!  Anything you order is delicious, FILLING and huge-guaranteed you will not finish a meal yourself-good idea for small appetites-share a meal-even then, we couldn't finish our \"waitress special\" of waffle, three meat (I choose 2 bacon and 1 sausage) and 2 eggs (nobody does poach like Blueberry-perfect!!) which I shared with my friend who ordered a waffle and shared bacon with me!  Definitely a dive diner with all kinds of meals from breakfast to dinner entrees, friendly, seasoned waitresses, quick turn around from your order to table with any changes to the published menu listings at no extra cost. Reasonably priced for great food!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Brought the whole family to eat and love it. Food is really delicious. Good service, staff very friendly."}
{"text":"Found this terrific restaurant in Vegas.  Husband and I had 2 trips for breakfasts and 2 for dinner.  I'm a pancake fan, and these are the best pancakes that I've ever tried.  Better than Original pancakes and IHOPS are not even in their league.  Omelette was huge easily enough for two; good but not the best.  Hashbrowns were so so. Parmesan chicken was crisp on the outside, tender and moist on the inside with incredible lemon sauce - sounds weird but was amazing. The meatloaf spaghetti style was great and again easily enough for 2.  Salad was very crisp, fresh and tasty - enough for 2. Soups are excellent. We had  a fresh vegetable medley which was cooked on the crisp side, the way I prefer, and very nicely flavored.  Husband loved the carrot cake, I've had better.  The blueberry pie was the best I've tried. These dinners were from the $7.77 special menus beverage, soup/salad and dessert. Yes that's right! Husband and I kept asking how they could provide this? Had 3 waitresses and all were terrific!  Their pecan pancakes- not on menu -are worth the trip to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Have driven by this place thinking it would be a great cheap dive. Pretty over priced for the quality and the service was lazy. Not much else to say!"}
{"text":"Blueberry Hill has been a classic staple of mine for years.  It's the most recognized 24hr diner in Las Vegas next to the Peppermill for us locals.    It's off the strip in various locations in town and always delivers with good food for a great value.  The strawberry ice cream pancakes were my favorite growing up and I still enjoy them from time to time this present day."}
{"text":"This place is the best for friends and families, especially for our family. Superb service for a toddler and staff didn't get annoyed with her fussiness. Hot chocolate is the best, always in stock and served with whipped cream and topped off with a chocolate chip cookie. Pancakes rock. No complaints, ever!"}
{"text":"nice country fried chicken steak"}
{"text":"Great food and reasonable prices, which is truly refreshing in Las Vegas. Service was very responsive, too."}
{"text":"The service was fast and friendly here but it seems kind of dark inside of the restaurant even during a sunny day outside at 5pm.  I ordered the Blueberry pancakes with no whipped cream and the compote on the side instead of on top.   The pancakes were super fluffy and d e l i c i o u s ! They did not need any butter added to them either. Just a lil syrup here and there. I'm glad I asked for the compote on the side though because I tasted just a little of it and I think I have diabetes now.   My boyfriend ordered the Dixie Meatloaf Breakfast which is the whole reason why we came here for dinner. He loves this. It is really good so I don't blame him!  Blueberry Hill is our favorite diner in Vegas and I think this location is the best, too. Our waitress, I think her name was Jessica, was wonderful!"}
{"text":"Turkey dish I ordered was on the salty side and really nothing to write home about. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Came in today for breakfast. Our server this morning was Adrian. He was very prompt in getting our drinks and taking our order. I was very indecisive on what to order and Adrian recommended the Wild West Omelette. It was simply AMAZING!!! THANK YOU ADRIAN for your awesome recommendation and top notch customer service. The whole restaurant looked very clean and well upkept. My wife and I will definitely be returning to this location. Heck we will even request Adrian since we know we will get stellar customer service!!!"}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp. Ordered the skillet omelette with egg whites and chili on top. Texas chili omelette. Coffee was nice and warm service was great. We ran into a local who told us about the chili so we had to try it. The only thing was the price was a little high. I guess when you're used to going to norms everywhere else seems expensive. $30 for two people. A little on the high side but great food. Go to country fries other than a hash brown those are really good."}
{"text":"What is not to like. Great service nice portions and fair pricing. We always eat here when we are in town. You have to get pancakes. This is not the time for your diet. See you next time."}
{"text":"classic diner.  Went for an afternoon breakfast.  Service was fast, coffee kept coming regularly, food was very good.  Portions large.   Off the strip a bit, made the breakfast more reasonable priced. :)"}
{"text":"I love Blueberry Hill.  I came here with my boyfriend Don. I ordered the 4 Chocolate Chocolate Chip Pancakes ($6.99) with coffee and Don ordered the chicken and waffles with orange juice.   The coffee was pretty good, but the oj wasn't fresh and at $2.39 a cup without refills, I don't think it's worth it.   We got our food. The chicken and waffles looked pretty small, but that might be because we had chicken and waffles at Hash House A Go Go last month. The chocolate chip pancakes looked so tasty and they had whipped cream on top to boot!  I didn't get to try the chicken and waffles, but Don finished them all without making any bad comments, to I'm assuming they were good. The pancakes were freakin heavenly! They were literally homemade from scratch and you could tell. They didn't stiff me on the chocolate chips like some places I've been to either.  This is definitely one of my favorite places to get breakfast and it's a plus that it's a local joint."}
{"text":"This is the 3rd Blueberry Hill restaurant I've been too and I'm not very fond of it at all. The service was very slow for no apparent reason. They just sat us, took about 5 minutes to bring over some menus, another 5 minutes to bring our drinks, then another 10 minutes to come take our orders. Mind you that there were only 4 other tables with customers because it was a midweek morning. If it were a weekend, the service would be totally understandable, but it was just annoying to watch the waitresses keep passing by us without taking our orders or refilling our cups.   Aside from the lazy service, the food was good (as usual). I had a Benedict, my mom had a spinach and cheese omelet, and my sister had huevos rancheros. All were very appetizing and huge in portion. The sauce they put on top of my Benedict was so flavorful and not too thick or watery. It was probably my favorite part of the dish.   I only wish the service matched the quality of the food. Even with us saying goodbye and thank you to the employees on our way out, we didn't get a single response. Unfortunately, I have to give this place 2 stars instead of 4 because I've experienced way better service at other locations."}
{"text":"I got a Monte Cristo sandwich with CURLY FRIES, and it also came with a cup of soup or chili!! That's essentially two meals for $10.29. The service is okay, but  they're a little slow on  the refills. Food is delicious, but some things are a little over-priced ($7+ for a grilled cheese, $4 for one pancake, etc), which is the only reason why I won't be adding this restaurants to my list of regular restaurants."}
{"text":"Great breakfast. Off the beaten path in Vegas. Great biscuits and gravy. Chocolate chip pancakes for kids-yummy"}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast wish I had Found this place sooner! Was there for breakfast and everything was good. Service was fast and friendly will return when back in Vegas"}
{"text":"This is nice family restaurant and there is a bit of everything on the menu. I have never had a bad meal here. I have never had a problem with the service before but tonight, the appetizers were delivered after the entre and the ate were delivered about 15 minutes apart. This has me somewhat unhappy. The food is good enough I will return."}
{"text":"First time going and tried the waitress special with Belgian waffle. It was all delicious and it will be a go to breakfast spot when in Vegas. We had a very friendly attentive server and were seated immediately and food was brought to the table hot and fresh in no time at all. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I ordered chicken Alfredo  parmigiana. The food came out really late and the chicken actually smelled bad and the portion was really small comparing with other locations. Definitely not coming back at this location."}
{"text":"We came here on a whim. I thought it looked good so fast forward two days later we ended up here. I went with the blueberry pancakes, bacon and eggs. It was so so good. The menu is huge! It was so hard to choose. They have some great combinations \"chicken strips and fettuccine Alfredo\" \"hot chocolate and a cookie\" anyways loved!"}
{"text":"I am LITERALLY obsessed with their biscuits and gravy dish. I order it ALL the time. We have been going here for a little over 4 years now and let me tell you, it was the BEST thing we ever did! Love coming back always at what ever time we did and wanted/craved for it and it NEVER changed. I love when my food NEVER changes, for me it means it's cooked the same beautiful way it tastes!!! My significant other switches it up at times, but loves what ever he gets as well."}
{"text":"We were so hungry and we wanted to try something we haven't had before, so we decided to check this place out. The crowd was fairly a mix of locals and tourist. We were seated promptly at a booth. The restaurant decor was a little dated, as my son described it it was kinda \"old school\". The service was fast to begin with. The menu was extensive. It was well organized in sections which anyone will find very helpful because it was categorized.   I ordered the Philly cheesesteak omelette. It was a little disappointing because it was bland. He eggs were overcooked which made the whole meal tough to dig in. The meat was rubbery. I didn't finish my plate.   Hubby ordered Tennessee steak and eggs. According to him, it was okay. Nothing special. He said it was cooked the way he liked it  but not something he would order again.   The kids ordered pancakes. 'Twas alright. They liked how they were shaped liked happy faces with chocolate chips. Amused them the whole time.   Overall, I'd still come to try the other things they have in the menu. Then maybe I could give an updated review. Until then, I'd give it a 3 star."}
{"text":"I like the breakfast here. I always get the buttermilk pancakes when I go. It's also the most busy location on Sunday, so plan ahead that day."}
{"text":"I love Blueberry Hill! It's definitely an older diner, but it gives it character! The menu has sooo many different options and all of them sound delicious! I normally order breakfast when I'm there, which is consistently always good. You get good sized portions and the service is very friendly. I consider Blueberry Hill to be pretty cheap, considering the quality of the food and the service you get. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"I'm a child of the 60's meaning my mother feed us well, this is the best place in Las Vegas for breakfast! Variety of anything you could ever think of. Service is fast and very friendly. EXCELLENTLY cup of coffee!"}
{"text":"We found this place way off the Strip on the way home to L.A. We were tired of Vegas Buffets and fast food. I ordered the Huevos Rancheros and my wife had the 5 small pancake special. The Huevos rancheros were good the beans and rice could use a little more work in the authenticity. Beans tasted like canned beans and the rice was bland. I get it it's not a Mexican restaurant but if your menu also consist of Huevos Rancheros and Chilaquiles you better get close to authentic as you can. I had a taste of the pancakes and the flavor was better than Denny's or IHOP. I would definitely go back but probably stick to the traditional American breakfast."}
{"text":"First time here. Loved the food. Only complaint was that everything on the menu looked great and we had to limit our selection. A wonderful alternative to the bustle and high prices of the Strip. I had the meatloaf and my wife had chicken crusted Parmesan. Our server, Sedelia, was so friendly and helpful. We'll be back next time we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"Our waitress was pretty slow and not attentive, we had to continue to ask for refills on our coffee, boxes, check and etc. As far as the food goes though, I have no complaints. There menu had a huge variety. We ordered the eggs benedict and an omelet, both were really big portions. The food came out perfect. Although the service was kind of bad, the food made up for it."}
{"text":"Alright breakfast joint. It has the standard greasy spoon menu. Everyone says the pancakes are the best around. Honestly, they don't taste any different than a Denny's or IHOP; good, just not different. They staff was nice. But the restaurant had uncomfortably small booths, the table was still sticky, though they wiped it again after we sat down. Not a terrible place but not great, I don't think we'll try it again."}
{"text":"My Wife and I LOVE this spot. They have killer $8.95 specials that include the entree, two sides, corn bread, drink and dessert! Kids eat for .99 Cents so not only is the food great, but the value is incredible. Great place for breakfast or dinner."}
{"text":"This place is a must   I make a point to eat here every time I go to Las Vegas. The food is amazing ( minus the pork chops) and they give you really big portions . Allison was my waitress twice during my last las Vegas  trip  and she was amazing .   If you go I recommend the biscuits and gravy or the Philly cheesesteak omelet ."}
{"text":"This place sucks!!! dont be fooled by all the good reviews. I was in Vegas an decided to go here with my bf since he found it on yelp, we took a chance seeing how it had good reviews but once again just like big boy In Pasadena I was dissapointed. I ordered an omlette with pancakes, I asked for substitutions and the waitress responded as if I had offended her by asking, she then told me that they dint have substitions and that even if she did it the cook would get pissed and not do my order. So I said fine Iam hungry and need to go Gamble, about 30 minutes later we get our \"food\", my bf was also dissapointed and said hes hash browns and eggs tasted like water and the only good thing was the waffle even though it was a bit burned. My eggs also tasted like water, pancakes were nothing special, bf said that even I make better breakfast and well thats all you need to know.Sevice=1,food=1 and the overall overated not worth it and Iam been generous since I have to give atleast one star on the reviews."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious, we had no wait time for a table . The server didn't know what jalapeño peppers was lol. The prices are very reasonable. No complaints"}
{"text":"Boring. Who knew that we'd end up in a place like this. Isn't Vegas the city of lights? Why does food have to be such a production? Aren't there good solid little hole-in-the-walls here? If so, this isn't it. If we lived in the area, this would be the place we'd go when everyone is too drunk to make any other decision...greasy, doughy food that serves the sole purpose of soaking up excess alcohol.   Here we had a sullen waitress, approximately 15 out of 20 tables with dirty dishes stashed on them, old fogies having coffee after gambling away their money on the slot machines at the entrance, and a parking lot best suited for a carjacking."}
{"text":"Can I give this place 10 stars?  I cannot believe that the parental units lived near Las Vegas for 15 years and never found out about BH; I know they would have loved it.  My friend and I did a mini-vacay and had breakfast here twice.  First time I had the eggs scrambled with ham and three giant, fluffy buttermilk pancakes that just may have de-throned Norm's Restaurant as \"the king of pancakes.\"  And they serve real butter, too!  Second time I had the honey coconut chicken and waffles which I very much enjoyed although I prefer that my fried chicken not have coconut, so next time I would order something else.  Everything is prepared from scratch, and my mouth was watering at all the delicious options, especially the eggs Benedict and chicken parmigiana.  This is down-home American food at its best.  The server was friendly and attentive and we can't wait to go back.  They have senior (55+) specials too."}
{"text":"Excellent pancakes!  The coconut chicken & waffles were amazing. The staff quickly accommodated our party if 18 for Christmas brunch and service was pretty good."}
{"text":"We arrived in Vegas late night the week of 5/5 still adjusting to east coast time and woke up the next morning wanting something substantial but not have it cost an arm and a leg (on the Strip).  We checked Yelp and came up with Blueberry Hill on S. Decatur.  WOW--what great luck!  (We try to be vegan but decided we might have to be flexible that morning.)  Arleen was our waitress--she was fantastic AND entertaining!  We fell in love with her and her saucy attitude.  She took great pride in what they serve at Blueberry Hill.  She made sure we knew that everything was cooked from scratch with real butter--no cans opened there.  We both ordered omelettes and chose 3 pancakes as our side.  The omelettes are made from 4--FOUR--eggs to give you an idea of how large they are.  Those pancakes were some of the best I have EVER had!!!  HUGE, light and fluffy and incredibly tasty.  As other reviews have stated, everything was super sized.  We ended up taking some of our omelette home as well as half of our pancakes.  I admit it; we went back a second time for more pancakes before we left Vegas.  There are lots of items for sale on the menu and I can only speak for our breakfast food and visits.  But I HAD to give Blueberry Hill 5 stars for our incredible Vegas breakfast experiences."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night.  Was my first time at his place.  Hostess was chewing gum and texting on her cell phone and told me to sit anywhere I wanted. I picked a table and sat there for over 5 minutes before a server noticed I was seated.  Several of he employees were sitting at the counter (in uniform) eating and on their cell phones.  Maybe management needs to teach the employees to use  the break room and not be eating in the dining room.  I ordered the turkey dinner.   Mashed potatoes and gravy were stone cold.  My server never came back to check on me or offer drink refills.  I had to ask the hostess to get my bill.  This was a very disappointing experience. This isn't a 5 star restaurant but come guys, at least pay attention to your customers and do your job instead of sitting at the counter.  Sadly to say, Blueberry Hill staff is unprofessional and rude.  I won't be able at this place.  I can spend my money elsewhere and get much better service."}
{"text":"Good food at a decent price.  Yes prices are higher in Vegas than the Midwest where I am from, but that is to be expected.  Service is usually quick and generous servings.  Menu is large and varied and breakfast is served all day long."}
{"text":"Great service, lots of seating and I like how they have all the condiments and creamers already on the table. We were a party of 5 and the waitress was very attentive and kept our coffee cups full. Good prices and big portions too!   My friend ordered the fruit filled crepe which had some special 4 cheese mix stuffed in it and she loved it. She even ordered some to go. You get 3 crepes for around $12.   I ordered the fruit and cheese French toast but wasn't blown away by it. They had a sugar glaze on top which was too sweet so I ended up scraping it off. They did give a good amount of cheese filling and berries but I still felt the dish was on the sweeter side, even after scraping off the glazed top.   Another friend ordered an omelette which came with 3 big pancakes... She did not finish everything. If you're craving pancakes and want some protein, you should order their omelette combo. It's enough to share, and the second person can order something else like crepes. A lot of the pancakes sounded delicious, and my gf told me that they make their own batter. I wasn't able to try it but i will next time!"}
{"text":"There is an ancient Chinese saying that goes \"If eating at a restaurant with Burrito in the name, its not usually a good idea to get a Hamburger.\"  That maxim holds true here at Blueberry Hill.  Basically, if you get anything that contains blueberries I have no doubt you're going to enjoy it.  The Blueberry pancakes are excellent as is the waffle and crepe.  In fact, Im sure if you do any of those with any fruit they're tasty.  Where the situation goes downhill is on the rest of the menu.    The eggs were a pretty sorry mess.  They looked as if they were left over from a buffet hot tray.  The hash browns were an amalgamation of frozen potato strips heated up to \"meh.\"  I recently got the Chili Cheese Omelet which had some fancy name like Texas Omelet and the chili was so plain I was actually scooping around it to get back to the eggs which says a lot (see above).  If I had only listened to those darn Chinese philosophers.  They appear to have a lunch and dinner menu, but to be honest thats like saying JC Penny's sells electronics.  Sure its there, but does anyone really opt for it?  The crazy thing is how crowded this place can get.  I mean, if everyone were there to get Blueberry pancakes, I could understand but I know there not....which means Im either missing something or Vegas has a dearth of solid breakfast options.    So to recap: Go if you need pancakes or waffles, especially with blueberries.  Avoid most everything else.  Three stars because they nail what their name says they should and their staff is quite friendly.    PS- Coffee is just decent."}
{"text":"great off the strip restaurant that offers a wealth of breakfast choices for every individual in your party.  very good food offerings."}
{"text":"so, im having kinda of a rough start to my 3 day weekend.  so I decided to go to blueberry hill, to get some potato pancakes and coffee.  first off, I know this place, so I brought my own coke, being that they are a pepsi establishment.  I order my potato pancakes as a meal with eggs and a protein.  I went with eggs, over hard and bacon.  when my food came, I got sausage and runny eggs, the waitress never came back to check on me so I could have it corrected.  I ate my potato pancakes and about 15 minutes later the waitress finally came back and asked me if I wanted a box to take my uneaten eggs and sausage home.  I said no, I didn't order runny eggs or sausage, I need my check.  paid my bill in full and left no tip.  if im going to pay 13 dollars for a meal, I expect to get what I wanted.  and if youre going to choose being a waitress as a career, maybe invest in a pen and a pad of paper, so you can get my order right."}
{"text":"This is the place for a quick filling breakfast. Its been years since we ordered anything other than the Mexican Skillet. Its just coffee shop food, but its so good and filling, and the prices for what you get can't be beat. I wish it were closer, but even if you just go to have a nice breakfast and hop over to Trader Joe's, its well worth it."}
{"text":"Been living in Vegas for 5 years now, and this has become one of our favorite regular haunts.  I don't think that in all this time we've ever had a \"bad\" experience... Sometimes a little communication can go a long way!  I love the coffee (it'll DEFINITELY get your day started!) and we are here for dinner once or twice a week.    We've even had holiday dinner here (Thanksgiving and Christmas), and the food as well as the company has been wonderful!  Our \"regular\" server is Rebecca, and she is always quick with the refills and our food is always hot off the griddle.  Not a cutting edge place, could use some updating - but the ambiance is cool (including the 50's music!)  If you're sick of the overpriced meals on the Strip, check out Blueberry Hill - you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Was in Vegas and found this spot on Yelp, decided to give it a try. Breakfast was great, Plate was full and filled me. Pancakes were really good. Had some hish school aged players for a tournament and they were all extremely satisfied and happy when we left. Service was very good, a lil slow but place was really busy. Prices were very reasonable. Great Place."}
{"text":"They allowed a dog inside while I was eating. Waitress was rude because she didn't really give us any attention,noticed her smiling at everyone else but our party (definitely didn't tip her) took her over 5 minutes to order some OJ after everyone else got coffee. And I don't like being handed the check while in still eating (what if I wanted something else, or wait until I'm almost done or even half way not right when I get my food) took over 45 minutes for two pancakes"}
{"text":"Great place to get a filling and fun breakfast off the strip!  You'll need Uber or a car of some sort, but it's worth the drive. GO!"}
{"text":"I would give ZERO stars if I could. Today would've been my mom and stepdads 17th wedding anniversary. This is the first year he will spend without her. So for Father's Day we decided to bring him to a place he has been eating at for 30 years. A place that is very near and dear to his heart. A place that lets him remember the great memories he had with my mom. Today I am APPALLED that after he sat there for 20 min drinking coffee. 10 min of which he was waiting for us to find a parking spot, the manager had the audacity to ask him to leave because hadn't ordered yet. What?!? Un. Believable. It took everything in my power to not cause a scene. WE WILL NEVER BE BACK. You don't treat people that way. Period. What's wrong with this world?!?"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast last week and wowza, it was great! HUGE portions and food was delicious. I had an omelet with home fried potatoes and toast and my husband enjoyed the short stack with corn beef hash. Waitress was super friendly and the hot coffee was great (recommendation of the Uber driver.) Husband said he wouldn't mind eating there for every meal!"}
{"text":"Very unique indeed.    We are out in Decatur and found Blueberry Hill Family Farm.  Which was an interesting place to have breakfast.  What kind of bothered me was the parking structure.  Of course it has nothing to do with the restaurant, just not fond of the limited parking.  The restaurant itself seem to be an old pink building that still looks good.  Inside the restaurant had more of an older setting to it.  But it was a nice feeling surrounding it.    Immediately we were greeted and seated at a table.  The menu was already on the table and very handy.  Looking through the menu, it was unique and interesting.  But I'm a sucker for strawberry crepes.  It was during lunch time, so the wait was a bit longer then expected.  But the food did make up for it.  Great tasting and very fulfilling.  Nice staff, a bit slow when busy, but very sufficient.    Overall, this would be a good place if you're looking for something new, in an old fashion restaurant.  If you go through the menu, you'll  find it interesting and yummy.  Pricing seems very decent for this restaurant.  Sure enough we plan to come back and try more of it."}
{"text":"I love love love blueberry hill. It's the type of charming all American average hot plate special serving, oldies playing, sassy waitress having, down home diner that feeds the soul,  as much as a grumbling stomache. Blueberry pie a la mode and a coffee from here cures all ailments (of the psyche). And the clientele is as colorful as the fare! Whether it's two muscle bound brosephs fresh from lvac, scarfing giant omelets for mutual gains. Or stoner types on the other side giggling about the virtues of gaming. This place is not for the shallow or faint of heart. Go here, sip on a milk shake while listening to the classics on the jukebox like it's 19 something or other again."}
{"text":"My favorite place thus far for me to enjoy a good ol' Belgian waffle!!  Parking is never an issue here, but like most standard Vegas joints you see the gratuitous slot machines as you walk in.  It was a Friday morning when I was last here and much to my chagrin it was pretty packed.  But we also had a party of 9 when we showed up.  The wait surprisingly wasnt as bad as I had expected, although we did get split up into 2 tables that were adjacent to each other.   Blueberry Hill is a local Vegas chain that I would pick everytime over the other nationally known diners.  The service here always seems friendly and Ive also been to the other Blueberry Hill off of Decatur but no matter which one I dine at, the service makes you feel like youre coming back to a familiar place for some strange reason.  Now to my waffle, I ordered waffles and eggs and the portions here are generous yet not too overwhelming.  However I am a fan of overwhelming cause it makes me not feel as fat when I cant finish my food.  The waffle had a great crispiness that I have yet to find at other places. I dont like it when waffles lose their body after being coated with syrup and this waffle did not.   Prices are also great here, for 9 people, our combined tab was still less than $100 (not including tip) I know this cause splitting the tab seemed like a pain and at the time I happened to be ballin (on a budget).  If youre in Vegas and can get off the strip and want a solid quality breakfast, find your nearest Blueberry Hill. Even if its your first time, itll feel like youre comin back."}
{"text":"This is a great place!  We spend time in Vegas, and were on vacation recently, and stopped there for a late night meal.  Awesome service.  Clean restaurant and good hot food.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Wonderful crepes with perfectly ripe fresh fruit. Friendly service. Location doesn't come up on Google Maps, but it's worth finding!"}
{"text":"One of best.  Service & food are great & it is open 24/7. Myself & my wife went there two days in a row, while on vacation in Vegas, we were so impressed.  Both visits had great food with large portions & very friendly servers.  Even when busy the order came fast.  The server's are very concerned that you leave happy & satisfied.  In your next visit to Las Vegasbe sure to visit & have a great meal."}
{"text":"Blueberry hill has turned into our go to breakfast spot when in Vegas. Nice family dining atmosphere with a variety of menu selections; generous portions and delicious food. Personally love the Oreo pancakes but I've also have had their omelets and crepes. You can tell the food has been prepared with pride in its presentation. I've  been here 3 times and service has been consistently attentive and never a wait to be seated."}
{"text":"A family favorite for breakfast and a must do each time we head to Las Vegas.  Even if playing a basketball game at 9am, the boys will get up to eat here at 6:30.  Everything is delicious but their cinnamon roll pancakes are the best. Very friendly and attentive staff and after numerous visits over the past 4 years, I can't say we've ever been disappointed."}
{"text":"This is a must whenever I'm in Vegas. Best breakfast around. Service is always great. Everyone has a smile and i get the sense of appreciation. They also have flavored cream...big plus in my book. The chicken sausage is the bomb!"}
{"text":"This is great spot for breakfast if you like that diner feel   Food and service was wonderful on my visit"}
{"text":"I was impress with how delicious the food was. The menu had so much options but the way they designed the menu was very easy to read and everything looks so good. The restaurant itself is very very clean looking. The waiter was fast and attentive even on a busy brunch. Coming from Phoenix and whenever we are back in Vegas we definitely will be stopping @Blueberry hill.  Not a lot of owners will take the time of day or extra money to put in on the presentation of the meals, impressed by the garnishment they put on plates you don't see that anymore at restaurants. I was so full but I was so tempted to try one of the yummy looking pies. Well worth our money and time! I would recommend this restaurant to everyone in Vegas..."}
{"text":"This is actually 1.5 Stars One of the worst experiences I've had dinning in Vegas... this is the reason you dont leave the strip to get food  After my sisters Bachelorette party and her fiances Bachelor party we all decided to grab lunch before heading back to LA.  we were 7 girls, 10 guys. The guys had gotten there first and they had set them up on 4 tables next to each other. When we got there the man at the door very rudely told us that we are not allowed to go in until they figure things out. So we wait... 5 min later no one came to get us so we went in and joined the boys...   Waitress was soooo slow. It took her over 15 min to ask us for drinks... then another 20 to bring it...   We ordered our food, some people at the table got food, some didn't..,  We had to remind her 5 times to bring BBQ sauce... Reminded her 4 times that one of the girls didn't have a fork...   Then we find HAIR in the food!!! GROOOOSSSS... we had to send it back, did we get an apology? NOPE... she gave us attitude took it back, and then brought another plate after 10 min.  Food was not that great either, I got a caesar salad, for some reason on the menu it said with tomatoes and onions... I asked for no onions.. it came with onions, I didnt complain just picked them out.. and no cheese or croutons on it.. =/ Not satisfied...  Rest of the food that everyone else got was just ok! nothing special...   Asked for refills on the water, didn't get them until after the check was given!   The waitress was rude, slow, and didn't bring us anything we asked for... top it off no silverware, one was dirty, and there was hair in the food... will I be back? Take a wild guess!! NOPE"}
{"text":"Went in today and had THE WORST EXPERIENCE.  We have been before a few times and loved the cinnamon swirl pancakes, and politely ignored the ant infestation on previous visits. This time our server was Nicki and she couldn't be bothered with us, she was only concerned with an older gentleman whom she was sitting and chatting with pretty much the entire time we were there. My boyfriend and I are not too picky, but today was a huge disappointment. He got a \"steak omelette\" which was actually only hamburger meat (no steak), incredibly bland and cold...I got the double trouble burger which was tasteless and burnt (even the cheese was burnt to a crisp), the onion rings just seemed to be breading filled with grease. The towel the server used to clean the tables smelled like urine, the wait staff and cooks were arguing loudly when we first arrived, and there were quite a few times where the full dining room had no food, no waiters and annoyed patrons.  My boyfriend immediately felt nauseated after eating half of his meal...we will not be returning, and wouldn't recommend this place EVER."}
{"text":"The food in this place is delicious with a lot of options for breakfast or dinner always with a great service!   100% recommended to go with family and friends."}
{"text":"I'm a regular Saturday morning diner here (along with my barber) and one of the reasons we come here is not only because of the terrific food (that's a \"given\"), but because of the excellent service given to us by LINDA.  In fact, we'd be very disappointed if we went in there one day and she wasn't serving us.  She knows our habits, likes and dislikes and takes care of everything, flawlessly.  I've never eaten anything there that wasn't fantastic.  Unfortunately, this location is no longer open 24/7.  They're open every day, but only from 6 AM to 9 PM."}
{"text":"My go-to place for breakfast- brunch! Hubby and I always end up choosing good ol Blueberry Hill because you can never go wrong with this place. Good service overall, and the food is always delicious!"}
{"text":"I used to love going to this place for breakfast until I saw a cocker roach walking across the floor! The food is delicious but where there is one roach there are many more! Not worth the risk!"}
{"text":"Huge fan of this place. Cooks are awesome, waitresses are friendly and the food is always delicious. Usually take the fam here once a week and BONUS... kids eat for .99! Great place off the strip for a great family dinner."}
{"text":"Got corned beef hash, eggs & pancakes. Came hot & exactly as ordered. Love this restaurant for breakfast only. Always consistent. Good servers too"}
{"text":"I love corned beef hash so I'm trying the corned beef hash & eggs with breakfast potatoes & a biscuit. Last time I was here I had the corned beef skillet which was horrible. Hopefully this dish is better. Our waitress told us twice she was bringing us water. So far no water. That was about 15 mins ago. We had to ask for our waters. Keeping tabs on service. Ok so this breakfast is by far better then the skillet. In fact it so delicious. Our waitress told us she was leaving & she assured us we would be taken care of by Vivienne. She has NOT showed up for a coffee refill or to check on us. Bad Service.  We've been here many times & never had good Service compared to other locations. We will never come to this Location ever Again.."}
{"text":"The day we were flying out of Vegas, I wanted to have a relaxed brunch with my parents and this popped up at the top of my list on Yelp! Also, I love trying local establishments and was excited to know that they exist only in Las Vegas!!  As soon as we walked in the diner like establishment was pretty apparent and we were seated at our table pretty quickly. Our waitress was great at the beginning getting our drink orders, but she was not that attentive through the rest of our meal. She never came back to refill my dad's coffee and also didn't bother checking in on us as to how the food was until she brought us our check!! :(  As for the food, it was excellent!! The potato pancakes were pretty good and the eggs were cooked perfectly! Also, the blueberry crepes were really well made and were delicious!!  So although the overall experience at Blueberry Hill was a 4/5, the food was definitely a 5/5!!"}
{"text":"Nice big diner menu selection but coffee was S***... :("}
{"text":"Made a stop for Pancakes before heading home to So Cal. I wasn't dissapointed, good tasting and big ! My wife got the Cinnamon Swirl pancakes and liked the taste and they were big ! Friendly service too !"}
{"text":"This is s great place for a late/early meal. I come here after work. (I get off at 4am). And the entire menu is available. From breakfast, to lunch, to dinner. Coffee is good, and the food. Can't go wrong with the service in here. Everyone is super nice, and friendly. I would recommend this to anyone for some good food in the AM"}
{"text":"This is a diner persons dream, especially the menu they offer.  Why would you want to eat anywhere else?  The reviews are good, the food looks good and it tastes good as well, this is a highly recommended place if you are hungry."}
{"text":"You can feel the racial barrier when you walk in. I've dined here several time on the late night early morning.  Me personally. I've experienced being ignored like I wasn't the only 6 foot black male standing in the establishment .not to mention the rude customers , good food tho"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite go-to restaurants for breakfast. The service, food and coffee is consistently good. There are many menu items to choose from and my favorite thing about Blueberry Hill is... their pancakes are made from scratch (not a pre-made mix)."}
{"text":"This place was Delish! Our whole party enjoyed the various dishes we ordered.  Everything tasted really fresh and our waitress was a sweetheart.  The prices were great especially after dining at Overpriced Vegas eateries.  Id definitely come back here again when I'm In town!"}
{"text":"A lot of food. Service was great. Blueberry muffin sooo good. Quite busy every time I've been here but they are always hustling to get everyone seated."}
{"text":"Bacon cheeseburger and good service. This place is a happening place . The food and service was good. Great Lil diner feel"}
{"text":"Dislike places that have menu the size of a bible. Keep it simple! Too many options gives me a headache.   Food was good but overpriced for sure! We ordered crepes, montrcristo sandwich, and a waitress waffle special and 3 drinks for $65. I mean, it's breakfast!!  Service was ehhh came to drop of the food and a box when i asked her too didnt see much of her other then that.  Will i return? Probably (only cause its close to home)"}
{"text":"Having never eaten here before I wasn't so sure this place would be any different than Denny's, but GOOD GAWD!!!! I ordered the apple chicken sausage waffle and it was incredible, the best waffle that I ever ate. it consisted of a waffle with four pieces of apple chicken sausage. They have a special sweet waffle mix that they use (you can also order a classic Belgian waffle) which was what made it so amazing. After having that meal I will return every time I'm in Vegas for the sweet waffles!!"}
{"text":"When the Las Vegas Strip becomes the home of the $25 breakfast, you need to venture out away from the Strip to eat like a local.  Every time I come here, I get fast service, delicious food, and I can get out the door spending less than $15 after tip. Try doing that on the Strip anymore. You can't.  It's busier on the weekends than on the weekdays, and depending upon the time of night the patrons can be entertaining in their state of inebriation. But you can't pass up the cinnamon roll style pancakes. It's more carbs and sugar than you should eat in one sitting. But it's so delicious that you'll just have to walk it off all day anyway."}
{"text":"The food is average but the customer service was excellent. Our waiter was very attentive and everything came out in the proper order. She always had a smile and was genuinely nice which is a rarity in Vegas.   I ordered the French Toast and my mum got the Bonanza special. My French Toast was average, I wouldn't get it again. The special was average as well. I especially liked the hash browns and would come back for these alone. They tasted like they were cooked in butter and were nicely seasoned. Average food, average price, amazing potatoes."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast (duh) on Sat the 23rd of August, and yeah liked it a lot. Bring your appetite, and don't order too much food, because the portion sizes are no joke, they don't mess around , they are for realz at the BbHFR.   I customized the hell out of my order, which was met with open ears and a ready pen. The food was yummy, the coffee was strong and the service was delightful.   Ordered - Chocolate Chip pancakes, next time will order just one. Also had the coconut honey chicken tender things, without the waffle, and enjoyed that. Had a side of bacon (I'm beginning to feel insecure about the amount of food I ate) and some toast...(cuz yeah I needed the carbs, not really).   I bet the prices are good here, I don't know really because I don't understand money all that well. I just charge things to my card and then Obama pays my card off. So yeah, you'll have to decide for yourself on that one.   The location is conveniently close to the strip and the dwelling of this girl I like. Double convenience for me! Yay. Ok I'm done typing now. I think I can type faster on my iPhone than my laptop. Done."}
{"text":"I think there is an ongoing trend with me.. I seem to love breakfast haha. If you come here I highly recommend the chicken fried chicken breakfast... it is mmm mmm good. The customer service is a bit lacking and some of the servers remind me of someone named Margette and Floe and no not selling insurance Floe. Just saying the smell of smoke on some of the ladies is so strong its gross. The coffee here is by far my favorite diner style coffee."}
{"text":"I have in here a couple of times and both times the food was excellent. They're never too crowded to give personal service. They seem to be busy bees working around the clock. So if you're looking for a nice breakfast check it out. They also have discounts in the evenings for children so check out those discounts."}
{"text":"They were fairly busy when we arrived but didn't have to wait long for our table. The portions were generous and everyone in our party enjoyed their meal. A nice affordable place to eat off the strip."}
{"text":"Our waitress was super nice and willing to serve the 12 of us with a smile!  She split the checks and gave us awesome service."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that we had a good first experience at this place. The food was good and staff was friendly. The second time we came here, the staff was still friendly but they sat us directly in front of a TV, playing Fox news. We had to sit there and endure president Trump ranting about...nothing. He literally was just saying words that didn't work together...I know that because the closed captions were on.  I'm fine with people having their political and religious preferences, but I think forcing that on your customers is totally unprofessional. The blueberry pancakes were not worth the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I don't write reviews very often, and I try to limit my hyperbole...but when I say these are the BEST pancakes I've ever had, I need you to feel me. I could smell how delicious these pancakes would be before I took the first bite! I had Tennessee fried steak and eggs and substituted reg pancakes for cinnamon swirl pancakes. I will be back as soon as I can afford a plane ticket back to Vegas please believe that!"}
{"text":"Given that it is a Diner, that is open 24 hours, AND it is in Las Vegas. This place is awesome!  I think people forget that this isn't a Morton's or Wolfgang Puck's on the strip. It is a Diner that serves all hours of the day.   I was writing this review but it randomly deleted HALF of my review. I'm really pissed...oh well.    So I'm going to keep this short and sweet.    I LOVE THEIR FRENCH TOAST!!!  HOLY MOTHER FREAKING AMAZINGNESS IN MY ORIFICE ON MY FACE!!!   That is all.      Ook not really.  So I had their omelette also.   HOLY CANOLI SPICCOLI! Their omelettes are TWICE! yes, TWICE the size of most places. The reason being is (I believe) that they use the eggs from the carton instead of real eggs. Either way, AWESOMENESS for a FATTY like ME!   ok I'm over the caps lock pretending to yell thing.  Just go. It's a Diner, don't expect 5 star service. Be happy they have good food, at reasonable prices.  It is a diner."}
{"text":"Very good place.  Definitely the best diner food I've ever had.  Very attentive wait staff without feeling like they are trying ot push you out the door.  They have a HUGE HUGE HUGE breakfast menu.  Their biscuits and gravy is incredible"}
{"text":"This blueberry hill is wack. The server kicked out my wife and her coworkers after they just did a 12 hour shift at the hospital. They wanted to just talk and relax and have a good breakfast. But then their plans were interrupted by a server asking them to leave because they were taking to long to leave????? Wtf kinda place kicks you out for enjoying their venue l??? Never has this happened at any other place we've sat to talked and eat for hours. Way to go blueberry hill management. Way to train the servers!! To top it off it's a dam Wednesday. I could understand a busy day but on a Wednesday really?"}
{"text":"We had breakfast here last Sunday before outfitting our empty new rental house in the area. It is a cute old school diner with good pancakes and eggs. The staff are really helpful and attentive. This is a good solid option for they are open 24/7 and there are several locations."}
{"text":"Nice server decent food basic breakfast spot. Pancakes were good as the eggs"}
{"text":"Best breakfast I've had in a long while.  Their french Toast was really tasty and delicious omelets. My friend had the hot Chocolate and even came with Whipped cream and a fresh Chocolate Chip cookie!"}
{"text":"First time here.  Didn't want to pay the high cost of breakfast buffet at the casino.    Pancakes: holy shit these are the best.  Amazing pancakes.   Chilequilesv: amazing real home made salsa verde. The plate was big and amazing.  My wife is so picky about this plate.  It is her favorite.  She loved loved it.   Sausage omelet : average,  but huge plate and more sausage than I have ever seen in any omelet.    Service: very nice,  coffee always filled.  5 star service.   Seats were s bit small,  and uncomfortable.  That is why they only get 4 out of 5 stars.    You must try this place out."}
{"text":"Overall its good but its not spectacular. I probably would go back. My nephew ate all his food so im going to say he enjoyed it lol i tasted his pancakes and they're pretty good. My omelette was good and so were the potatoes but my friend didn't enjoy their chicken."}
{"text":"My Peppermill away from Peppermill. Amazing food and a massive menu. The Alaska Waffle and the huevos rancheros benedict are nuts. They even have Oreo cookies and cream pancakes. Service is hit and miss but the food is ALWAYS good."}
{"text":"Blueberry Hill and Egg & I have cornered the market on good off-strip breakfast spots in LV.   I'm choosing to review the former based on the awesome pancakes and better tasting coffee than the latter.  I sampled the chorizo skillet w/ a short stack of pancakes.   My buddies had the meatloaf and gravy (can you say trucker dinner portions?!) and eggs benedict.  All three meals were huge but filling.  Wait time can seem long here but the line seems to move fast.  Not much decor or kitsch if that's what you look for.   Just solidly priced breakfast (again, try those pancakes!) holding it down for Eastside LV."}
{"text":"Looking for someplace friendly to eat off The Strip? This is it!! Amazing menu - there's something for everyone! The service was prompt and super friendly. Suzi from NY was adorable and told us where to shop nearby. If they allow it, request Suzi as your server!!! The prices are so reasonable compared to The Strip and it's an easy 15 min drive."}
{"text":"Best blueberry pancakes in town.  Chilequiles are pretty good too, but their refried beans are canned and rice is stale.  They refill coffee like it's going out of style, but can be forgetful on H2O.  Locals get free blueberry syrup and flavored coffee creamer."}
{"text":"We always stop here for breakfast when in Vegas.  Great food, large portion 's and decent prices.  A favorite place for the locals it always packed but worth the wait."}
{"text":"Chicken fried chicken, scramble eggs, and apple pancakes was really good. Service is a little slow but overall good experience. The hype is real about the breakfast and pancakes here! Big portions as well."}
{"text":"Great food - often very crowded, especially during peak breakfast hours and on weekends. Well worth the wait.  Huge portions too!"}
{"text":"Mostly because they serve huge portions, this chain gets the sparkly stars. One order can really feed two. Yeah their plates are sharable. But, I wouldn't recommend sharing your hot chocolate ;P  You should see their cakes! I'm told they're pretty good for their value. I saw the orange cake. The frosting looks deliciously zesty. Wish I had room to try a slice!  Quick service at this location. There are several Blueberry Hill locations in LV. Look 'em up! A decent choice for a late night grubba munch."}
{"text":"Typical diner environment. Good friendly service and reasonably quick. A good selection and nice variety from American to south of the border. The food both times we went was ample and very good. I had the corned beef hash skillet and the Pancho Villa- I recommend both. I sampled my bro's little boy blue and enjoyed the blueberries. Next visit I come here."}
{"text":"Portions were great. I had the French Toast, and I'm picky!  It was very good. Service was great, very attentive staff. It's a diner type setting, nothing special as far as the restaurant. But I will definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"This was a fantastic diner!!! Great home cooking and atmosphere!!! When in Vegas this is a must for a late or early Breakfast after s night on the town..."}
{"text":"Yikity yikes.  Aaron V. found this place for us, but we dropped the ball in blindly trusting the Google directions.  From the strip, you can get there just by driving down Flamingo. Avoid any directions involving freeways; you will drive twice the distance.  Now to the food.  I had SOOOO much food.  Indeed, the chocolate chip pancakes did not have chocolate chips *in* the pancakes; but they were still pretty delicious.  I also had corned beef hash and poached eggs, which were also great.  Finally, the coffee . . . hmm, the coffee.  To hell with Starbucks, diner coffee is the best!  If you want to avoid breaking the bank for a day meal on the strip, take the short drive to Blueberry Hill; it's worth your while.  Just FYI: they make their own pancakes, dinner rolls, and deserts."}
{"text":"Been coming here since the early 2000s, and it is still the best diner to this day. If you're ever looking to grub on solid breakfast food, this is the place to go. Their portions are out of this world. My go to item is the chorizo omelette. It's humongous as it's made with 4 large eggs, and it comes with a side of Spanish rice, beans, home-made salsa, and a side of tortilla. They also have the best blueberry pancakes (hence the name blueberry hill) in the game. They're so soft and fluffy!   Service is quick, pleasant, and accommodating. Never had a dull experience here."}
{"text":"They have really good hot tea and I love the dixie meatloaf for breakfast... its on a biscuit with gravy and it has meatloaf.  Yum!!  The blueberry pie is also really tasty."}
{"text":"Good classic diner.. Got thr breaded pork chops and eggs..awesome.. Didnt eat for the rest of the day"}
{"text":"Perfect place if you're tired of hotel cafes and food.  Had breakfast there that was served all day.  Loved it.  Prices were reasonable and service was great.  Would definitely come back here on our next trip back."}
{"text":"Not sure I'll be coming back to this restaurant again the food is good the service is good but the owner's son and his young friends are so loud and using foul language so badly it ruins the atmosphere and my meal I was totally embarrassed to invite a friend here and not be able to have a conversation because the language was so inappropriate and the laughing and giggling in the throwing of thing and again the foul language and see that it's the owner's family doing that really even made me more upset and considering this really may not be a family restaurant after all"}
{"text":"Breakfast was wonderful!! Coffee was great!! Employees were friendly. FYI plates are huge portions enough to share."}
{"text":"The menu seems to have changed since I was here before. It is a little smaller than I remember but this is not a bad thing. All the favorites are here (except my chicken fried chicken and eggs) but still I don't feel too bad about that. Everything is still good and hot and fresh.  Hubby and I are always bringing out of towners here when they visit.  And all love it. Pancakes are good and I love the waffles.  Not fancy but try it, you'll like it."}
{"text":"OK read this one, this place is outstanding!! everything is made from scratch. Get away from the strip and venture out to \"blueberry hill\" you wont regret it. Pancakes are to die for, OK that's a little blow out of proportion but, definitely the best I've had in Vegas. Orange juice is fresh squeezed and the servers are sooooooo friendly. My wife and I went here 2 out of the 3 days we were in Vegas. We ventured out of the strip looking for breakfast and found it.  Don't miss out on Blueberry Hill!  $7 to $8 per person where can you find that these days in vages."}
{"text":"The service is so nice but the omelet had unmixed eggs in it and the potatoes were quite raw and crunchy and cold. The mushrooms and Swiss cheese was in abundance."}
{"text":"Visiting Las Vegas, had the chicken and waffles with apple compote. Delicious! Chicken tasted great and the waffle were perfectly cooked - crispy and not over cooked. Good came out piping hot  Coffee is standard, cream is Coffee-Mate vanilla or an alternative non-dairy. They use real butter. Omelettes are made of 4 eggs! And you can request egg whites for 59¢ extra. Good customer service and sat quickly. Locals seem to frequent this place, and doesn't smell of a tourist trap. Overall good experience!"}
{"text":"We tried this place on a whim and wasn't impressed at all. Service was slow and our waitress kept disappearing for extended periods of time. Me and my bf both ordered omelets, hash browns, and toast. He had a veggie omelet and I had a steak omelet with tomato, onions, and peppers. The cooks put no thought in how they prepared these things. They came out with these enormous size vegetables tucked inside that should've been cut way smaller. You actually had to knife and fork these things. The coffee was weak and tasted burnt. I'll never return."}
{"text":"I want to give this place a 3.5 but I'll round for yelp sake. Typical diner service. Quick and fast paced. Our sever was very friendly and always got what we needed but you can tell she was busy and had a lot going on. Even with that we had a good experience. Even though it was super busy we were sat very fast so I was happy about that.  I had the boy blue or something it was a blueberry pancake combo with 2 eggs and choice of protein. Everyone on yelp raved about the blueberry pancakes so I had to try and I loved them. The compote was not too sweet. I usually hate too much stuff on pancakes but I'd go back for it again for sure."}
{"text":"Pros and Cons of our visit to Blueberry Hill Family Restaurant.   Pros *Food was really tasty.  *Nice menu with lots of pictures and unique items.  *Large portions of food at affordable prices.  * Food was very tasty!  Cons *Poor service, (I'm only rating my visit)  Wait staff just seemed uninterested/unfriendly. But this is Vegas. What did I expect.    Summary  I'd go back lots of yummy looking food pictured on the menu I did not order today."}
{"text":"Excellent place to eat ...Manager Linda is awesome.Waitress all r very friendly .great place for breakfast"}
{"text":"Thanksgiving visit to this restaurant, 2017: 4 stars. Waitress special of a Belgian waffle was really fluffy and sweet. My bro had the pancakes that were also good honest American style breakfast. Meats were OK as well. Always had our coffee topped and warmed up. Verdict: will be back again for our next Vegas trip."}
{"text":"Came in on Christmas day and got sat immediately. Stephanie was quick gettin us our water and coffee, as well as taking our order. We ordered the daily special w/3 eggs, 4 pieces of bacon, and hash browns, as well as toast, as well as an order chicken & waffles. Now this is what a home cooked breakfast is all about! Twenty-five minutes later, we needed a to-go box, because damn thats a LOT of food!! But I loved how fresh the waffles taste, and they use real eggs, not the eggs in a gallon jug like the chain breakfast spots."}
{"text":"Texas chili and egg whites w/home style potatoes n toast. $11.99. Portion was kinda small for the $11.99 price. 2 Egg whites, 2 strips of bacon, crispy (burnt) hash browns (go w/home style potatoes instead) n toast $8.99. Two hot coffees $5.99. $30 for two is a bit pricey but service n meals where good."}
{"text":"These guys have definitely stepped it up a notch. My first time here I had a great experience, and then something happened and their food and service just went downhill, and then now we gave them one last chance and I must say I had to update my review and give them more stars. We were in town for EDC this time and stopped here for brunch because it was close to our vacation rental and they have a little bit of everything on their menu. You can have breakfast food, lunch food, or dinner items.   We ordered pancakes, their tuna sandwich, and an egg omelette. Their portions are very generous for what their cost and the quality of the food was a HUGE step up from what we were given during our last visit. This is a faimily style diner so dont come expecting Vegas Strip style 5 star restaurant quality food, BUT its definitely good food for a good price and they're open 24 hours. Our pancakes were hot, fluffy, and big. The Tuna Salad in the sandwich was very good, freshly prepared, and the tuna itself was fresh and very good. The egg omelette was very big and delicious. We definitely had leftovers and enjoyed the rest of our meals again later.  Their service was great. We came in at a pretty busy time and got seated right away and received good seevice by staff the entire time. I'll probably come back here again next time im in town because they have redeemed themselves in my book!"}
{"text":"i got the 5.99 special and added some blueberry compote on the side...  if you are in vegas dont even think about dennys. this place can get crowded, but its worth the wait"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good but the restaurant itself is dirty dirty dirty. There were tiny ants crawling on the walls and the booths looked like they haven't been cleaned since the restaurant opened. It was a turn off for sure."}
{"text":"I like this place. It's simple, convenient and has alot of variety. I ordered the chicken salad sandwich and it was really large and hit the spot. Tuna Melt isn't bad either. It's a typical diner with all the different options. Beats Denny, IHOP, etc by a mile. Open 24/7."}
{"text":"I found this place on yelp and so we decided to try it. Upon entering it's a lot like an IHOP. The food was really good especially for the price. Service was super atmosphere was very cafeteria like. Ordered the eggs Benedict and my beautiful friend ordered the Florentine. We finished both of our plates with smiles on our faces. It's a little bit off the strip so it's about a $15 cab ride to get here so take that into consideration. But definitely worth checking out it's nice to find something that's not corporate in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Cute breakfast spot. Pancakes are so yummy and fluffy. Family owned so it's nice and small. Our waitress Claudia was very nice and sang happy birthday to me. Offered complimentary birthday cake but I was so full from the pancakes. perfect before the drive back to Cali"}
{"text":"The plates where huge, enough food for you to share with two people and still have left overs. I don't think I've ever been that full in my life . The food was really good but my service as just ok my waitress never came to check on me or asked if I needed anything witch I did. I had so much food I needed more to drink. All she did was take my order and check and that was that."}
{"text":"I love Blueberry Hill more than any other restaurant in the whole wide world. It goes without saying that some of the food is lackluster, however, the quality is consistently good, the specials are tasty and usually a great deal (dessert included....yum)Chocolate cake....... Last time in there my server made the comment that dessert was his favorite part and it was fucking hilarious. Breakfast at Blueberry Hill is a consistent 5 star worthy meal as well. crepes, pancakes, skillets, its all great. Go for breakfast and keep going there goddamnit."}
{"text":"\"Waitresses Special\" was excellent (waffle, eggs and bacon).  Arrived at 10:00 AM on Sunday morning and was greeted nicely and checked in.  Was told it would be less than a 15 minute wait.  Sat 4 of us in 10 minutes.  Place was full.  I've been here about 5 times now and always impressed with the service and food quality."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in for breakfast one morning and I must say breakfast good. I ordered the honey coconut chicken and waffles with a side of hash browns and my wife order the 4-3 breakfast with a side of hash browns. Everything was decent except for the hash browns.....I must say that I have only sent food back one other time in my life and this was the second, they were extremely hard and rubbery. When she brought us the second batch the were under cooked and greasy. But overall breakfast was good and the service was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Decent breakfast place. Took my dad out for breakfast before we ran errands and we stopped in for a bite. The ham steak and eggs platter was great and I'd love me to explore more of the menu."}
{"text":"As much as i like BBH as an overall family brand... The service at this location has always been lacking.  Food is still belly busting, but if i had my druthers.... I would go down the street and have that extra umph known as service...."}
{"text":"So I use to say this was my favorite family breakfast spot because portions will make the belly bust.. I just have one issue and that is the bacon served, it is the saltiest i can remember of any breakfast spot, other than that the positives are RED who will greet you as you come through the door( not her real name) and our favorite  server  Cindy that always puts the cherry on  top Great service puts this as the favorite BBH location....."}
{"text":"Blah blah blah bland.. If your 67yrs old and on a strict no flavor diet, then this is the place for you. Never again. I wish i had 2 more hands so i can give it 4 thumbs down"}
{"text":"First and foremost I want to thank Jennifer for her hospitality and Professional Service second of all the food is amazing we are from LA is it in Las Vegas we just stopped by because people told us about this restaurant please walk in you will not regret"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times now when I come to Vegas. It's a good family restaurant with amazing yummy food. Only reasoning behind my 4 stars is because staff was a bit off that day. Bus boys had to pick up the slack of the server but other than that I enjoyed my Oreo pancakes and honey coconut waffles which was amazing!!!"}
{"text":"This place is bright inside so don't bring your drunken mistakes here. There's a lot of parking to go with the crapload of seating with a friendly staff and fairly quick service. The bathroom, although littered with graffiti from those inescapable hoodlums, was clean and fresh smelling. The pancakes are a must try. It's fluffy with a thin crunchy rim and melts in your mouth fantastic. You can even replace the hash browns and toast for it. I was recommended the chicken fried steak but the pancakes were the real main course. I definitely would come back again."}
{"text":"Our service was very good. My wife liked the breakfast potatoes. I'd give it a passing mark. Not many people there. My first cup of coffee tasted pretty good. I prefer local restaurants over chains. I'd go back but it isn't high on my list."}
{"text":"Coffee shop. Not spectacular, but hits the spot.  It is open all night. Food quality is okay.   I wouldn't order a steak or anything.  The pancakes are excellent.  My favorite is the cinnamon one.   I now have them use the granola pancake and add the cinnamon mixture to it.   Talk about crazy good.  Eggs/Omelets/Egg Sanwiches are very good. Potato pancakes are very good. The porkchops were okay, but not my favorite. Sandwiches are good. Salads are pretty good per my husband.  No one complains when we come here.  Artwork is cute an quirky.  Look for the little hidden funny items on the etched glass.  **Regarding LOGO - Blueberry sauce in the picture should really be blue even if it is not accurate.  Everyone I bring does mention the image and says not good since it looks like something else."}
{"text":"This is a 5 star diner, period! The serving size was ample. The service was splendid. If you're a hungry big guy, get the \"Four Threes\", it's well appointed"}
{"text":"Came here for a late night snack. Service was great food was average. I ordered the special for 6.99. It came with toast hash browns bacon and 2 eggs. Came out pretty fast. I ordered the square potatoes instead of hash browns. If I go again I'll prob order regular hash browns! Pretty good place though for a quick late night snack."}
{"text":"Good diner style food. The service leaves a little to be desired. Asked for more napkins got 2. Just 2, for 2 people. No real cream for coffee, a cardinal sin. That is probably the only real negative. Half and half isn't that expensive."}
{"text":"Wow if you go here, the pancakes are a must have! Don't even get me started on the cinnamon swirl pancakes. Big portions at good prices."}
{"text":"follow up from my previous review. we have been back twice since our original visit and service has been outstanding. it could be due to going on sunday morning early before church let's out. the food as usual excellent and even my wife is enjoying it ( she's not one for breakfast)   we will continue to bring friends and family from out of town!    until the next time"}
{"text":"Me and my partner were in a hurry and they made sure that we got our food in time. The service was prompt and accurate. All the waitresses were sweet and friendly. And the food was excellent and hearty."}
{"text":"Very disappointing, as a Vegas local, we have seen Blueberry Hill our whole lives. Now I remember why we don't eat here. Service was quick and friendly, but the waitress laughed at my order, more of a smirk. The food is nothing to brag about. My biscuits and gravy were bland, biscuits burnt on the bottom, like covering it in gravy will change that. We didn't even finish our food and the waitress didn't seem to care either. We won't ever return, I would rather eat at McDonald's for breakfast."}
{"text":"I always come here. The waitress even knows my order and is awesome... this time though the cook just didn't care and neither did the staff. They got my order wrong the first time and then brought he additional food which I found a long ass hair in. Nope not again"}
{"text":"I have friends that go here, so I join them every now and then. I only eat breakfast there. The food is fine. All of the standard breakfast items. I have a little problem with the service and the prices. Breakfast for 3 is usually $40 before the tip. One good thing is that it's open 24 hrs. That's worth a star. Usually crowded. The servers always look stressed, and they forget things like refills. It's okay, but there are other places where I like the breakfast more."}
{"text":"Had heard good things about this place so we gave it a try for breakfast/lunch last Friday. We were seated right away and the waitress was prompt with drinks and  orders. The menu is big so it took me awhile to make a good choice. I went with the potato pancake combo. It was good, solid... nothing exceptional. Came with both sour cream and applesauce, which I liked. Hate having to pick one. Overall a decent, expedient, reasonable meal. Good standby."}
{"text":"My buddy from Vegas loves this place.....I have to say it is decent food.....what we like the most is the variety and options you have when ordering....they probably have 200+ plus items or variations of things you can order....  Today my lady got the Irish Benedict and I had the chicken fried steak.....I will be back for an update....  Service is solid, friendly and nice....gave us time but checked back to see how we were doing.....always a mist stop for breakfast in Vegas.... =)"}
{"text":"This was our first visit. Having been New Years Day, many local places weren't open, and we didn't want to go to a chain breakfast place (ala IHOP, etc). We liked seeing a few people go in and seem to know each other as well as the staff. Regulars are always a nice sign for me!  The place is clean and basic diner feel. Nothing to the blueberry hill...I thought it would have blueberries or be more 50's like the song. Still clean and next to taste of food,  that's important when I eat out!  My husband had some kind of rancheros type thing I forgot the name in Spanish. It was scrambled eggs with tortilla chips in them served with beans, rice, etc. He said it was okay, and didn't care for the tortilla chips cooked in the eggs. The salsa they served on the side was very fresh, flavorful and delicious.  I had the crepes with a cheese type apple compote inside and whipped cream on top. It was so delicious!!!! Our portions were very large and neither of us could finish them.   Service was pleasant and not too pushy. I'm more of the European mindset of being left alone between receiving items and dislike when servers come over every 5 minutes. They should keep an eye on you, but not keep coming over to interrupt if you're having a lively conversation and it's obvious we don't need anything (like some places I've been to)...this one was really casual with just the right amount of service.  My only suggestion is that they make gluten free pancakes too. They advertise it's made from scratch so it's easy to substitute wheat flour with rice flour and a couple other tweaks. That's the only personal downside, however the waitress suggested I send in some recipes and write the owners. I think I will as this would be a nice place to become a regular patron of.    BTW - they are open 24 hours and their daily specials look pretty good! I'll try lunch or dinner there sometime!"}
{"text":"Average to good diner. Nothing more. Pancakes are good, bacon unfortunately tasteless. They have good dinner deals but a overwhelming menu. Not the best sign. Coffee far better than most diners but tends to be pricier. Maybe quite OK for LV"}
{"text":"I come to this restaurant 3-4 times per week. Today for the first time nothing was correct.   I asked for the manager. He is not here. Why? Rigo Rangel where are you? Are you on the payroll? Who is managing this restaurant? Why didn't you tell your staff where you went? How can  a restaurant operate with no manager?   Gross Manager.   Boycott Blueberry Hill."}
{"text":"2/14/15- 8am: Sat on the right hand side of restaurant. If i could give them -1 stars i would. Our server was the worst ever. We ordered coffee and toast and was asked by her \"-that's all you're not having breakfast? We responded with yes, and a smile. Oh our server was not happy at all. After 45 minutes she asked us to move and sit on the bar individual seats. We weren't happy at all. She said there was a line and people are waiting.  We agreed to leave and we looked there's  a lot of tables available and the line was no longer there. So wrong to treat people like that."}
{"text":"Great service, great food and the most amazing cinnamon swirl pancakes ever created. Life changing even. The biscuits and gravy and hash browns are also a force to be reckoned with, but do NOT skip the cinnamon swirl pancakes!! This has become our favorite Vegas tradition, hands down."}
{"text":"One of my favorites in Las Vegas and must come to every visit. Pays to have family living here. The mix they use for pancakes and waffles is out of this world. We everything is homemade. I've only come here for breakfast but I'm sure their dinners are just as good. I LOVE this place."}
{"text":"Best panckaes I've ever had!!! This place has the yummiest breakfast. Their servings are pretty big and good for sharing. The highlight are those pancakes!!! We tried the steak omelette and pork chops breakfast plate. The breaded  pork chops are a must! The entire staff is super friendly and the service is great."}
{"text":"Awesome food, very clean, HUGE menu, and decent prices.  The family had a variety - spaghetti, pancakes, crepes, and french toast.  Everything was great.  I'll visit here next time I'm in Vegas, especially when looking for a quality breakfast."}
{"text":"Perfect breakfast. Service was fast. My waffle with fresh fruit was huge and delicious. Price is very reasonable for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"It was just that A-Ok. Nothing special but not terrible either. Our waitress was really nice but almost too advanced in years to be waiting tables (it kinda took her a long time to get coffee refills)...it wasn't a big deal. My man and I are chill people.   I had the ham and cheese omelet with chunky potatoes (recommend those over the hash browns). The sourdough toast was pretty tasty too. My man had pancakes and bacon...he must have loved his because they were gone in about 5 min (he was hungry). I am sure we will be back if we are in the neighborhood and feeling some breakfast food."}
{"text":"My family is full of big eaters and we used to all do a big Christmas at my Grandparents' house in Vegas. After attending Midnight Mass with my mom one year, we were driving home and gave each other that shameful look. I ask ashamed, \"Are you hungry?\" She looked back, more ashamed because she was the adult, \"Yeah.\" So we hit Blueberry Hill and had a Alaskan Waffle...each. My love of the restaurant was born.  For out of towners, visiting BH should be a tradition unlike any other. The Yelp description of a five-star is dead on: \"Whoohoo! As good as it gets!\" BH should be the standard by which every chain breakfast place compares themselves. A conventional breakfast haus, the food is good, the servings are large, the pries are fair, and the service is great.  Go to Blueberry Hill. It's not far off the strip and you'll feel a hell of a lot better grabbing a breakfast there (and getting away from the Strip)."}
{"text":"So this was a bit of a shocker -- as Blueberry Hill Family Restaurant has become a breakfast staple on our Las Vegas trips (got to get off the strip for waffles and ice scream), when we pulled up to this one, shame on me, I'd Yelp'd the wrong location. Apparently we usually visit the location just west on Flamingo. How could this be a big deal though? It's a local chain diner.   I don't know where this location went wrong, but everything was a considerable step below the BHFR I expected. The coffee, just warm. The service, noticeably slow (at every step). The food, not quite to snuff (very little butter on our pancakes, eggs were cooler than the rest of our dish, and some very fatty bacon).   Of course I'd try again on the name alone -- but it won't be at this location."}
{"text":"This place used to be our go to spot for waffles and pancakes -they do something magic to the batter.  However, after 3 visits of long waits at the table before even a drink order is taken(from what appears to be understaffing; our waitress was nice but was all over the place with too many tables to tend to) and then having food arrive tepid (if the butter isnt even remotely melting on my waffle, pretty sure that's an issue; also at this point we are all starving from the ridiculous wait, so we just eat our cold food) we wont ever be coming back. We gave multiple chances at redemption,  and it only got worse with each visit."}
{"text":"The sweety and I went here for breakfast. This place has abundant seating. It has a substantial menu. One word describes Blueberry Hill.  Awesome. Our eggs were fluffy and flavorful. The Chili Verde sauce had some kick. The pancakes were very tasty. The servers are friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. The prices are very fair,  the atmosphere is comfortable. I plan to definitely go back.   Worth the trip."}
{"text":"Its your traditional breakfast place. Pancakes are good, food is good. Large Portions but coffee not so strong."}
{"text":"One of my top favorite places to eat breakfast at in Las Vegas. The restaurant is not too far from UNLV which is very convenient for college students like me. When I go I always order \"The Little Boy Blue\" which comes with blueberry pancakes, two pieces of bacon or sausage, and your choice of eggs. I also order a side of their hash browns that are made fresh. You can definitely taste the difference between Denny's and Blueberry Hill.  The blueberry pancakes I order are so delicious! There's no need for syrup on these pancakes because they top it with blueberries, and blueberry jam. What's the point of going to a placed named \"Blueberry Hill\" without trying any of their blueberry concoctions?  Whatever you decide on ordering in the end will not disappoint. My word of advice however, be ready to want to come back for more!"}
{"text":"To me, this is an American \"bread and butter\" diner. Just come here to fill up for breakfast and nothing more. Food is good, not stellar."}
{"text":"Great breakfast diner not too far from the strip Open 24/7 Had a breaded pork chop combo. 2 pork chop, 2 eggs and 3 enormous pancakes! Good food, server was friendly, reasonable price"}
{"text":"Been coming here for the last 15 years. We don't leave Las Vegas without eating at Blueberry Hill. They have a large menu selection for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Staff is very friendly.  Some waitresses have been with the company for years, which makes me believe it's also a great company to work for. Will continue to come back. Definitely recommend you stop by."}
{"text":"I'm from Buffalo, NY but have family in the Las Vegas area. We go here for breakfast when I am in town and it's definitely one of my favorites!  There are plenty of choices for breakfast and the portions are fairly large. Besides breakfast they also have lunch, dinner, and desserts. I've only ever had breakfast there but I'm sure the other food is just as delicious. Everything is made to your liking and there is a ton of seating. The restaurant is huge.   The only real drawback is that it can get crazy busy depending on the day and time that you go. There is a pretty big parking lot and the staff moves quickly so the wait isn't terrible.   The prices vary but overall are decent and fair for the food that you get. I only wish there was one near me so I can go whenever I want."}
{"text":"The last time I went, the service was horrid and the waitress was rude. But still, it's a great place to go for breakfast! I'm also a fan of the monte cristo sandwiches they serve."}
{"text":"Off the strip, but worth the uber ride twice on our last trip to Vegas!  I am a lover of flavor, spice, and a hearty breakfast!  I had the meat lovers skillet, I was overwhelmed with all the flavors in my mouth!  You can taste how fresh the veggies are, and the chunky potatoes had great flavor. Corned beef hash was prepared a little different than my mom makes, but it was still amazing.  Sourdough toast, and biscuits were both amazing!  The sourdough biscuits were a perfect brown on the bottom, but soft and fluffy throughout.  Hot chocolate....amazing.  I was brave and tried something new.  The meatloaf topped with bacon and white gravy was surprisingly good, enough to feed 2 or 3. Service was great, very relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"By far the best French toast I have found in the Vegas area. The staff is always nice, the place is always packed but I've never had to wait more than 2 minutes to sit."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast!!  Party of 4 & we loved it so much we came back a 2nd day!!  Everything either of us tried was cooked to perfection & tasted great!!  Breakfast for sure next trip to Vegas!!"}
{"text":"If you are from Spokane or any area that has a Dennys or IHOP, this place has a very similar atmosphere, except that it is locally owned. When I sat down I immediately thought, \"wow this is a lot like the Diner on Grease\" if your into the old school diners, this is the place for you.  The service is good, the food is good (great French toast) they have a ton of options to choose from. It is not just your every day breakfast stop. I was excited to see chicken and waffles on the menu, but decided against it as the chicken was filleted and not fried with bone. I ended up getting the Waitress Special which had eggs, choice of sausage, bacon or ham, a waffle and toast. I would say it was decent. This place is not for the faint of heart. I'm a picky egg and chicken eater, if your not and you like salt, this place will be great! my husband had the ham and cheese omelette that came out about twice this size you would anticipate, it could easily be shared and he said he liked it. They really push the iced coffee which comes in an old blue plastic cup and leaves a a lot to be desired. I would much rather have paid $5 at Starbucks then the $2.69 for that, I ended up not drinking most of it.   We love going to local restaurants, we will most likely be back again:)"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant.  It's old school and the breakfast today was awesome.  Besides today I've actually come to this location many times over the years because their breakfast is always great.  There always seems to be people in here eating all the time when  I come here.  It has a relaxed atmosphere and they play old school sock hop  music.  Has that diner feel to it as well.    Server was on top of things for the most part and she was nice and friendly.  Besides the music the background noise is kinda loud with the dishes clanking and silverware crashing together.  All the way around its a nice budget breakfast!  Check it out"}
{"text":"Delicious! Everything was fresh and cooked perfectly. Our server was very friendly and efficient. I was poured a cup of coffee as soon as I sat down. The portions are huge. The bill was about the same as Denny's, but the food, service, and overall appearance of this location was significantly better. This was our first time at Blueberry Hill in a very long time, but we will be back!"}
{"text":"I just f*%#king love this place. It is what it is. A classic family diner. The food is awesome and the menu is huge so you never run out of things to eat. The pancakes are delicious and fat! You do get a huge portions of everything so come super hungry. I always make it a point to come here when I arrive from out of town. A hangover cure!My favorite breakfast place!! I love you blueberry hill."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a great breakfast joint... you came to the right place. I love their little boy blue pancakes! Absolutely delicious!  However, I think the service could be a bit better. The girl who cashed us out didn't say one word to us. Other than that, give this place a try."}
{"text":"The food is good. The blaring Christian music and Christian books for sale by the cash register are a bit odd considering they are steps away from the video poker machines. I'm taking off 2 stars because of this.  ##UPDATE## I mentioned this to the manager on duty and she changed the radio to a contemp rock station. Not sure of it will stay this way though."}
{"text":"I try other breakfast places and I'm always disappointed. This place just spoils me with how good it is. I always get the same thing when I come. An order of French toast & the chilaquiles. Omg this place and their French toast, I always recommend people to go here for Ft! I could go on and on about it. I've never had any place that makes it as good as they do."}
{"text":"Best pancakes I've ever eaten! The breakfast was very good and the customer service was phenomenal!  They have an 8 page menu and awesome iced coffee!   We came back a few days later for lunch before heading home and the service and food was equally great!"}
{"text":"Blueberry Hill is an old-school American Diner that looks the part. It literally looks old both inside and out. Worn walls and flooring, neon lighting trimming the walls... I'm sure this place has seen better days one or two decades ago. But, I guess you can say it has character.  What matters most, of course, is the food. It isn't bad. With a menu that rivals the thickness of the one at Cheesecake Factory, it might take a while to figure out what you want. They have just about every comfort dish you'd expect to find at a breakfast, lunch, and dinner spot like this. I typically go with pancakes for my early morning meal, but opted for their strawberry crepes ($10.09). A light and mild cheese blend mixed with a strawberry compote filled three delicate crepes. Sliced strawberries topped the dish. Portions are large but I still managed to devour it.  An even bigger dish was my wife's Denver omelette ($11.09) filled with cheddar cheese, diced ham, onions and green peppers. It was accompanied by some awful hashbrowns, extra crispy bacon, and deliciously spongy french toast.  The size of the kid's chocolate chip pancakes ($5.39) was ridiculous. It consisted of three pancakes that would have been challenging for any adult to finish, let alone a six year old. Chocolate chips were sprinkled on top and worked into the batter and a mound of whipped cream topped it all off. My kid and I enjoyed attacking it and it left him in a sugar high.  Breakfast wasn't cheap. It ended up being about $50 for the three of us. But, it did leave us happy and full.  3.5 Stars"}
{"text":"Anytime is a good time for breakfast as far as I'm concerned lol. Huge portions too.   For some reason this place makes me happy lol. Maybe it is the family type of atmosphere. Or the music. Idk but my bf and I could be not getting along nicely but sure as ish when we go here we have clearly forgotten wth we were conflicted about with each other. Maybe it's bcoz our tummies are full and content lol.  Here, https://youtu.be/fKfYnVaN8k8"}
{"text":"Had a great experience. Good service, hot food and hardly any waiting. Then again it's Thursday morning about 9:30am."}
{"text":"There are pages and pages of food on their menu! They have every possible American diner breakfast food imaginable plus lunch and dinner items that look just as good. I came here for breakfast and was pretty set on getting a waffle but after looking at their menu, there was a lot of back and forth between my desired waffle and everything else on the menu. What sold me on the waffle was the \"made with pure butter\" note in the Butter Cream Waffles section. So bad but butter makes everything better! I ordered the Fresh Fruit Compote Waffle with Strawberry and a side of sausages. The waffle was heaven...it was soft and sweet with a bit of toastiness to it. The strawberry compote was sweet and perfectly tart and had fresh strawberries in addition to the cooked fruit in the compote. I only wish that instead of canned whipped cream, the restaurant made fresh whipped cream to top the waffles.    Service here is very friendly. One thing I like about this restaurant is that their booth seating can seat up 6 people (booths are always fun), maybe 7 or 8 if you're with sticks. Also, check out the older waitresses with the their fun and colorful eyeglass strings. This location is in a shopping center so there's ample and easy parking."}
{"text":"First time at this particular location 4/14/2018 - was another great visit at a Blueberry Hill Restaurant. This time I tried the mushroom/cheese omelette with country potatoes. Delicious! Our server was kind of scarce but she was nice towards the end. I felt she may have been overlooking us because we were seated in the very corner, facing away from people. Even so, she knew this was her table.  I think we'll be back if we're in the area. This place has so much to offer - food and fun with friends."}
{"text":"Well, just eaten here for the first time & just left a few moments ago. I ordered the eggs benedict florentine along with the oreo pancakes. I was terribly underwhelmed. My cup of water appeared unkempt w/what looked like egg yolk smeared on the rim.  The service was poor. I had to walk to the counter to ask for extra hollandaise. I puked the entirety of my soul into the toilet after witnessing a hulking log of human excrement in the toilet, laying in full glory for all to see. Suffice to say, I'll NEVER eat her again & wish I didn't have to dignify this poor review with any stars but since I do, one, singular star will do."}
{"text":"For breakfast, we ordered chilaquiles Mexican style, cinnamon pancakes, coconut chicken and waffles. OH MY!!!! I'm super impressed, nice waitress. Good prices. A Las Vegas gem!"}
{"text":"Classic diner experience with friendly staff. Wide menu choices, breakfast is always best in my opinion. But their home baked pies are the real secret."}
{"text":"Great service, got in quickly, inexpensive, wide variety on menu, blueberry pancakes and biscuits and gravy. All-inclusive dinner specials for $9 and kids eat for 99 cents."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times and the food and service is always great. The biscuits and gravy are awesome. It seemed this time, we were seated by Adrian, who was both kind and courteous. We then heard another employee complain that they would take care of us. We waited....waited...nothing. Then Adrian asked if she helped us. We said no and he proceeded to take care of us. He is great at what he does and should be acknowledged as so. If not for him, we probably would come back to this location. Thanks Adrian!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I spent the weekend in Vegas. Tried this place one morning, and The Egg and I the next. Blueberry Hill wins, no contest. Moist, flavorful veggie omelet and the shoestring potatoes were by far the best I've ever had. Freshly made, not frozen, browned crispy. My blue berry muffin was outstanding, not overly sweet.  Hubby had a Scramble but I can't remember which one. He loved it, and he's hard to please. Service was good, even tho the waitress seemed to be having a tiff with a customer. Prices were beyond reasonable. We'd go back for all our breakfasts in Vegas."}
{"text":"My favorite place for BREAKFAST!!!! Like an ole diner. Good service. Friendly staff. Great food."}
{"text":"Nice little diner. I had the Little Boy Blue which were the blueberry pancakes eggs and your choice of meat, I chose bacon. It's a cool breakfast spot off the strip"}
{"text":"This place is like going over to moms house. Everything is simple and excellent. I had the chicken fried steak for dinner which was great. The mashed potatoes are the real deal mashed reds with the skin mixed in. I was so grateful to find a place to get a good meal... like a breath of fresh air."}
{"text":"By far the best breakfast that I have ever had in my life and I have eaten...A LOT! I came here twice during my stay in Las Vegas and I sampled a variety of items. I had the meat skillet and it was delicious. The potatoes were seasoned just right and the cheese was perfectly melted and the eggs cooked just how I like them. I tried the waffles...so crisp and fluffy...I tried the blueberry muffin and it was so soft and just melted in my mouth.  On my second visit I tired the omelet with home potatoes and sourdough toast...and I tried my friends pancakes. The bread, the eggs and the pancakes were all so fluffy and wonderful. I just can't say enough about how good this place is.   The service is always excellent too. I will be back during my summer vacation in July. And I'm going to try even more menu items."}
{"text":"I've eaten here before and was satisfied. The food was great. So when my family was in town I suggested we go back. As we were waiting on our food to come out I noticed a big ROACH crawling in our booth towards my sister. GROSS my kids were terrified. As we were leaving I told the waitress to cancel our order because we won't be eating in an establishment that has roaches. She said \"I'm sorry. We just sprayed\" I'm no bug expert but that means there's an infestation if they are coming out to dine with us."}
{"text":"I love this place great eggs Benedict. The pancakes are as big as hubcaps (no joke). A lot of variety. This is a must visit if you want a great breakfast off the strip that os down to earth. Delicious breakfast comfort food.   A very good value considering most restaurants in Las Vegas are overpriced."}
{"text":"Great food selections!  Awesome Breakfasts, more food and half the price of the food on the strip"}
{"text":"OMG OMG this was my first time here and I'm still trying to stop eating! This is the best breakfast food if give it 6 stats of I could! Our waitress was Nancy and she was wonderful, it's Sunday morning and super busy and my biggest complaint was that my stomach wasn't big enough. I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Stopped by for brunch before heading back home to LA from Vegas. Blueberry hill reminded me of iHop, the menu is so huge, there's sooooo much to choose from, doesn't help an indecisive girl like me ;(.   The boyfriend was craving steak and eggs, so he ordered the 10oz rib eye with 3 eggs ($14). He ordered medium and it came out well done, we didn't bother sending it back because the food already took a while to come out. The steak was pretty bland and extremely dry, very hard to chew. The hash browns and eggs were good, but it's almost impossible to screw up eggs and hash browns ..   I ordered the French toast combo, it came with 2 pieces of French toast, 2 eggs and 3 links of sausage. My combo was good, but then again ... eggs and sausage are so basic that it's almost impossible to screw up. The French toast was really good and not too sweet.   Overall, probably wouldn't return unless I'm really craving that French toast."}
{"text":"Blueberry Hill is the most awesome place right off the strip in Las Vegas. It is very similar to an IHOP, but Vegas'ed out. We went here for a late night meal because it was near our Timeshare. The prices were reasonable, the service was over and above especially for the time of night and the best part was the food was fantastic. The only bit that got me was they only serve certain things during certain hours and my first pick was not one being served then. They have a huge range of choices though so we ate like pigs."}
{"text":"This review is mostly for their chocolate chocolate chip pancakes. Every time I go to a breakfast place and they have a double chocolate pancake type of thing I have to get it. I'm obsessed with chocolate anything. The one here beats every standard breakfast place that serves it! It's a must have for people with a sweet tooth. My boyfriend ordered some sort of steak that has bacon and cheese on top of it. It also came with hasbrowns, eggs, and toast. It was also really good. We never saw a steak with bacon and melted cheese on top! It's so bad yet so good. Haha! The server accidentally brought the wrong toast, so we ended up getting that extra toast for free. I can't complain aboout free food! The portions are huge, so it's worth the prices. Also, the server was very friendly and funny, so she made my experience even better. I'll be back whenever I want to fufill my chocolate craving. I can't go there and NOT get it!"}
{"text":"We are so happy we found this place. Their menu is huge, everything is delicious, and its pretty cheap. it'll make you fat, but isn't that a good thing in a restaurant?"}
{"text":"Outstanding family restaurant. Atmosphere and food are excellent!!!! Coconut Crusted Chicken & Waffles are crazy!!!!"}
{"text":"It was exactly what I rated it A-OK. Nothing fabulous. Nothing too bad. Just A-OK.  Would I come back again? Not likely.  Positive: Tons of food choices on a huge, as in HUGE menu.  Negative: Service was super slow and not attentive."}
{"text":"I used to go here pretty regularly in between services at the church I used to work at. I am sad to say the quality of the food has gone down in my opinion. I always got the corned beef hash with hash browns and coffee. The coffee is good, and the corned beef is still yummy, but the hash browns were... wet and soggy. They used to be very crisp and delicious, so I'm disappointed. I honestly stopped eating them after one bite they were so mushy."}
{"text":"Forget the bling and mimosas. It is Sunday. You went too bed way too late/early. You had the full-on Vegas experience, and now you just feel what most of us feel on the Sunday before you hit the road back to wherever you come from: the hangover!  Well forget advil! Blueberry Hill will cure it all. You've starved yourself for weeks to fit in your tiny dress, and now what you're craving is family-style, oversized, comfort food! Welcome to Blueberry Hill!, where the pancakes will feed a family of 4! LOVE THE PLACE! Balance a shiny, bling bling, vegas girls trip with a casual breakfast ! A must !"}
{"text":"Was in Vegas for a week long party and fellow party goers (aka my friends frm Phx) said lets go out to breakfast and try Blueberry Hill, oh once the name was said I could only picture nice fluffy pancakes with big beautiful blueberries in them in around them!  So I forced myself to be up and ready by 10 and off we went!  We were a party of 8, but it was ok, we didn't have to wait long for a table and service was great!  I ordered some coffee and water to start, needed that to get the brain working, then just for s&g's I checked out their menu, and I almost derailed myself a few times from my order, everything sounded so good!  When it came to my turn to order, I asked for the blueberry pancake stack, minus the blueberry compote, with side of hash browns, oh boy was I in for a treat! The pancakes were better than I even imaged them to be! They were fluffy, packed with nice juicy blueberries on the inside & topped with whipped cream & fresh blueberries on top! DELISH BABY!! Hit it with some syrup and that was sweet bliss! The hash brown they make them fresh and to me they were more like breakfast potatoes and they didn't disappoint!   Breakfast was good, I will come back and have to try out other parts of the menu's everyone ordered a different dish and everything looked great!"}
{"text":"reminds me alot of IHOP but a wider selection. Food is tasty meaning you don't have to season everything with salt n ppr. Good customer srvc and very flexible on substitutions. Always crowded during the breakfast n brunch hr so u know food must be good."}
{"text":"Best pancakes I have ever had. I have to stop by every Vegas trip. You Gotta try them. Also, the corned beef hash comb includes pancakes."}
{"text":"I came here based on the yelp reviews.... Holy Cow the breakfast here was AMAZING !   I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Very disrespectful. Waited to be seated when there was available seats for a long period of time. A family walked in 10 minutes after and they stood up and went behind us to pick them for seating. Out of disrespect, we decided to leave. Will never eat there again."}
{"text":"We found this by accident looking for somewhere to have breakfast. Had the breakfast special of steak and eggs.  The best steak by far after we'd tried 3 different steakhouses on our visit. The staff is great, the portions are large, and it's done well. This is one problem, there's so many great things to choose from. I think everyone will find a favorite. The berries going past our table smelled so good, we will be back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Could not believe this place. I ordered a chorizo skillet and got served a pan full of some taco bell style ground beef. I understand blueberry hill isn't exactly known for authentic mexican food but damn I wasn't even given the right animal.   This particular location also lacks a bar, not exactly a deal breaker but their less than palatable food is handled better with a little buzz."}
{"text":"I love me some Blueberry Hill... they never let me down.  This is a real diner... looks like it could've come outta the 70's even. haha  Anyway, I used to go to UNLV and live so close to this location, so it's a favorite of mine.  They have an extensive menu that offers dinner on one side and all-day breakfast on the other.  They make everything from scratch.  Everything I've had here was excellent.  And finally, large portions for reasonable prices 24 HOURS A DAY... what more could you want?!?!  I almost always get the Waitress Special, which is a Belgian Waffle that melts in your mouth like clouds.  I like their sausage links with it... and over-medium eggs.  *sigh*  If I'm not in the mood for breakfast however, I'll get their grilled cheese sandwich with chili... nom nom nom.  And their carrot cake rocks!  Wish they had a Blueberry Hill in S. Bay...  See ya there!"}
{"text":"So me and my friend Traci P went here after wanting to try this place for weeks, we were all excited and hyped up until we sat down...  Where do i start?  So we look over the huge menu and everything looks so delicious after about 10 mins off looking i decided to order the Country breakfast which comes with Three eggs, three buttermilk pancakes, three bacon strips or three sausage links or ham steak, I choose the sausage links. I ordered a coffee to go with my meal as well.   Ok so the pancakes were pretty delicious fluffy buttery goodness but how can you mess up pancakes? The eggs were ok nothing fantastic and same with the sausage just average. I felt I could have made made this exact same breakfast myself so that's why I was disappointed.   The service was not very good I ordered coffee never got a refill until I hunted down another waitress to get me a refill. I also witnessed our waitress giving another table even worse service the table had been sat and was never brought there drinks until about 20 mins after being there the waitress comes up to them and says \" oh how about them drinks, what were they again\". The table was not very happy with the service and neither was I and there was no excuse because the place was dead.   I probably wont be returning here again threes nothing real special about their food and the service is terrible. Yes the portions are huge but who wants a huge amount of mediocre food?"}
{"text":"E X P E N S I V E !!!  Their 24 hour schedule could be a contributing factor. It seems to me that restaurant's who have the most return customer's are those who feed you really well and feature favorites like a platter of biscuits and sausage gravy that's under five bucks. Or like Sills restaurant in Layton Utah that has their famous flat scones, look em' up online and they're affordable and memorable. And they are usually packed seven days a week. The cost for a cup of coffee at BLUEBERRY HILL is 2.89. Not everyone is in their price range so we eat at home."}
{"text":"REVIEW #1,000 - Blueberry Hill Family Restaurant deserves this spot!  After an early morning phone message from our hotel trying to sell us spa services, we were out of bed and ready to get out of that casino once we were done at their gym. We stopped at Chase to get some cash, and only then realized it was getting late and we hadn't eaten yet. Blueberry was visible from the bank's location so we excitedly headed there. As we walked in, the hungry husband and myself were happy to see it wasn't packed, but wasn't empty either.  I ordered two eggs, hashbrowns and sourdough, with a side of the hot house salsa and a roasted jalapeno. (I had seen one in the menu pictures and had to have it.) It didn't take long for the hot food to arrive and our waitress told me they'd roasted 2 jalapenos for me! Yumm. These were no ordinary jalapenos. I don't know how they found huge, gigantic jalapenos, but they were awesome. Really hot, too!    Everything on the plate was yummy. My hashbrowns were cooked crispy and the sourdough was decent (it's hard to judge sourdough outside of the Bay Area because we really have the best stuff there!) The salsa was so good too! I could only eat one of the oversized jalapenos but our nice waitress brought me some Saran Wrap so that I could take the other one with me.   Service was great. Our server was attentive and friendly. I wish I knew her name, but the receipt only says \"Server #8\" 1/29/14 12:59 p.m.  People like her are the reason we enjoy going out to eat so often.  ($20.71 total for our breakfast.)"}
{"text":"Great spot to come to right after check out from the strip. Parking is easy and service is always friendly and fast. I love the country fried steak and the gravy is amazing!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast EVER! we were visiting from Whittier and looking for breakfast we were actually headed to Dennys, i looked you guys up by reviews and that was the best descion I made in Vegas.... Oreo pancakes, strawberry pancakes, hashbrown were screaming good, even the toast was unique. We had it all ,me and my family. You even had a friendly kids meal with blueberries and shaped pancakes.  Bacon , wow. Never had bacon like that. Awesome stuff all the way around. Very friendly staff. Thank you, until our next trip"}
{"text":"The food is a bit overpriced, but it does taste good. You will find most college aged kids here. They cleaned up the place with the rift raft that used to come. The service has always been fast and people are always smiling. They are quick to refill your soda if your soda even if you didnt want another one."}
{"text":"This is my go to breakfast spot with my boyfriend if we're looking for something quick.   There is so much to choose from and they always let me alter my order for healthier options of available.   Crepes are so good!"}
{"text":"My daughter brought me breakfast this morning to the physical rehabilitation hospital and it was delicious. Very hot, not warm, tasted delicious.... and great portion. So this customer is very happy with your service and quality of food. I know it's hard for to go orders to taste good and this was exceptionally perfect. Thank you"}
{"text":"The best in the west.  Canadian ham is so good it make come back for more. Great service coffee and tea."}
{"text":"Great 24 hour place. The waitress was very friendly, which is rare to find at 3AM. I got...you guessed it! The blueberry pancakes, and they were quite good with fresh blueberries baked right into the pancakes."}
{"text":"Great service.  I had an omlette with pancakes.  My husband had the Grubsteaker.  He liked it but thought it a touch bland.  I liked my omlette.  It was satisfying and a great value.  Not life changing but satisfying.  However..  the pancakes.  Oh good golly the pancakes are good.  Thick and fluffy and perfectly cooked.  I thought I had died and gone to breakfast food heaven.  They just melt in  your mouth.  Slightly crunchy outside and moist and fluffy inside.  Perfect."}
{"text":"Wow. The breakfast are delicious. Homemade blueberry muffins  are outstanding. Service was on point. Nice friendly staff. We ordered the potatoes pancakes with sausage and eggs over medium, biscuits and gravy and waffles.  Everything was outstanding. Taste wise I didn't care for the gravy but the biscuits were so big. I would definitely order one with butter and honey, fluffy and full of flavor. Definitely come if back the next time we're in town."}
{"text":"mad this place closed. loved it, the food...service...everything. sad. I would REALLY have thought the military crowd would have kept this place going...looks like ill have to drive to their other location. Sadly, wont be as often due to its location."}
{"text":"Food came out big, tasty and well priced , first time there and I was very surprised on the quality. Defiantly be back again for a cheeky breakfast. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars, was the weirdos that hang around that area, which isn't the restaurants fault at all."}
{"text":"This is one where I wish yelp had 3.5 stars and not just 3 or 4.  We went there for breakfast and split the meatloaf covered with gravy, it was great, the pancakes were also excellent. The service was just a tad off which is why I don't think it deserved the full four stars, but I will let them have it anyway."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located directly across from the Extended Stay hotel on the Southside of the Vegas Strip. My family and I went there at 7am on a Sunday morning. We were promptly seated and had a nice waitress. The food was very good! Pretty affordable also. They have flavored coffee creamers which was a plus for me since that's the only way that I like to drink my coffee. The pancakes were HUGE! The ham and cheese omelette was flavorful. I was pleased with this dining experience. Give it a try. You might like it too;-) (Only 4 stars because the decor was lack luster. It's a diner. I guess I shouldn't be too picky.)"}
{"text":"This is the second time we have eaten here for breakfast when we've come to Vegas. It's a little way off strip and the first time we came here it was a mission trying to find it. I am sad to say that I don't think this place has the same owners as the last time we were here. The food was mediocre, the pancakes were smaller, the staff was nowhere! We waited for about 15min after we were seated for a waitress to even come over and inquire to our existence. It was all downhill from there. If it were for the fact that we were already very hungry, I think we would have probably left. The pancakes were still good, light and fluffy, they just were the same. Sad to say, just won't be going back."}
{"text":"We waited 30 mins to get our meals. There water tasted really bad.i had a stomachache after eating their food."}
{"text":"service is super slow.  it seems that they hired many wait staff without experience. wait staff is terrible at their  job. food is edible.   price is average. I also noticed almost half of wait staff is gay. Nothing against them but they are always too melodramatic  about everything."}
{"text":"This is my first time eating here and I ordered Bacon and cheddar cheese omelet. I wish I took a picture so I have a proof that the bacon in the omelet that they served to me was burnt. My omelet taste bitter because of the burnt bacon.  Not a happy customer."}
{"text":"This place has great food! We went there on our way out of town yesterday and had pancakes which were the best ever, fluffy, delicious...chicken fried steak and eggs with gravy, very good, and ham steak and eggs (great ham steak,) and a western scramble which was absolutely perfect. The sourdough bread must be home made. Wow. Margarita was our server, and made sure we had everything we needed. Awesome!"}
{"text":"This cute family diner has everything you could want from a diner; a large selection, lots of food for your money, and friendly service. If you're looking for a delicious, filling breakfast try any of their omelettes with their French toast. It's to die for!"}
{"text":"pros...want some good old fashioned breakfasty stuff?  don't know where to go? well this is a great place to go for that.  with all the girls waiting for the depech mode concert, and just liquered up from frankie's, this was the perfect place to get our stomach filled with some delicious breakfast.  let me tell you about the french toast, and the grilled muffin.  sounds weird to grill a muffin but if you have not tried it, you should.  adds another dimension to your plain old blueberry muffin.  some warmth and butter flavor to it never hurt. and as for the french toast, it is so very delicious.  soft, warm and toasty too.  it lets you just taste the butter and the sugar and the slightly crisp outside and the warm and soft inside.    let me say this, that this is the place to go if you just had some drinks.  especially if you have some pretty mouthy girls on your hands.  let them just eat the alcohol away.   cons...not much, but wish we had one of these here in san diego."}
{"text":"I love The Blue Berry hill, It's not too from UNLV and this place Is perfect for those late nights after heavy partying, right before class and even after class. The Hill Is best known for they're breakfast but It has a large menu for lunch and dinner. The servers are sweet and they are very attentive when It comes to coffee refills.   My fave is the Corned Beef with 2 eggs which comes with your choice of hush browns or pancakes and toast."}
{"text":"I always eat there late when I get off work and sit by myself at the counter. Usually try a different salad and have not been disappointed yet. Great customer service and clean dining area. Cooks are pretty good and seem happy in the kitchen, even the graveyard cooks. Tells a lot about the food, if the cooks are happy, foods gonna be good."}
{"text":"This place was an amazing find from the expensive mediocre spots on the strip. Great service and excellent home made food!  The turkey and stuffing was the real deal!! Breakfast was delicious also! Will be back next time."}
{"text":"Typical diner food. Not bad not good. Egg and I is a much better breakfast place. I had classic eggs Benedict and hash browns. Nothing really blew our socks off. Husband had turkey and dressing. Little on the dry side. Gravy was bland."}
{"text":"Let's start with some observations...  The fire department folks eat here (good sign).  Two busy windows for hot food slamming out of the kitchen (another good sign).  A not too long line of people waiting for a table (a great sign as far as I am concerned).  Soooo...  I grabbed a seat at the counter right away. A few dirty dishes still present, but no prob. My server cleared them away at the same time as asking my beverage order. All good.  I ordered bacon and eggs with some pancakes on the side.  Eggs scrambled just right (NOT whipped all yellow) and bacon. Bacon was a bit thin, but all and all good.  The pancakes you ask? GET THE PANCAKES! Fluffy battery buttery syrupy goodness!  Service was nice and smiley with promptness thrown in.  To heck with all the kitschyness and long line at the Peppermill, (especially on a weekend!) I am coming here instead! Oh... Next trip here, I will be trying one of the three layer cakes I was staring at. Hmmm... Maybe later today!"}
{"text":"My husband and i are on a mission to find a decent breakfast joint and I was extremely eager to try this place...but boy were we disappointed! The pork chops were meant to be crispy but was disgustingly soggy and greasy...the crepes were ok but the worst part of the experience was when I found a nickel size piece of plastic embedded into my crepes! When i brought it up to my waitress she said she would let her manager and cook know to be more careful smh...but she still left it on my Bill!"}
{"text":"Overall, this place was great! Awesome family diner feel. My husband had a delicious turkey BLT and I had the sausage skillet. The skillet was tasty, but it was 70% potatoes which was very disappointing. Not much sausage, peppers, or onions even though I asked for extra onions. I posted a picture of the potatoes that were left over - waaaayyyy too many. I really would have liked more meat and veggies. I also ordered a side of country gravy, which the menu said you could order a side for free, but I was charged an extra $2 so that was disappointing. The biscuit I got on the side was huge and delicious. I would honestly go back just for biscuits and gravy. Would definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a hearty meal!"}
{"text":"We always get their blueberry pancakes and they are great! But we gave the biscuits and gravy a try last time...and holy cow!!! BEST BISCUITS AND GRAVY I've had anywhere."}
{"text":"the place didn't look busy and there were plenty of waiters but we still waited to be seated, waited 20+ minutes for food.  since i sat directly facing the food/order window, i watched my food order sitting ready and uncovered on the counter under the window for 15+ of those minutes while they were trying to complete my bf's order.  the entire time waiters were pulling items and other orders over the top of my food.  needless to say i didn't really have an appetite after watching my food sit out for so long and who knows what falling into it.  there were shrieking kids whose parents did nothing to discipline.  and they started sweeping the floors next to our table while we were eating.  not coming back here again."}
{"text":"This was a great recommendation by a local at the Renaissance. The environment is lively, food was very good and the service was excellent. I'll be back!!."}
{"text":"This place in insane (the good insane).  They blow away IHOP, Denny's or any other coffee shop I've ever been to for breakfast by a wide margin for breakfast.  I had an omelet, hash browns and pancakes which were really good and the coffee was excellent also.  The service was also as good as it gets."}
{"text":"A visit to Blueberry Hill has become a ritual on every trip we take to Vegas now.  You can trust that mostly everything on the breakfast menu is made from scratch and will taste delicious.  The service can be slow because there is typically only one server on staff when I go late at night.  I've had both breakfast and dinner here: dinner is good but breakfast is great.  Blueberry Hill satisfies whether you need a late night post Las Vegas BLVD meal or a good breakfast in the morning to help with that hangover."}
{"text":"Two days ago I thought Las Vegas was all about great shows, exotic, expensive meals, people watching, and of course gambling. I was wrong. I really regret that of all the times I have been to this city I was not told about this Mecca of a diner. I am now a convert to the lightly breaded meatloaf on a fresh biscuit and covered in gravy. Or the pancakes. Or the 4 egg omelette. Anything you eat here will help you understand that when someone says Sin City, they mean it is a sin not to visit and eat here."}
{"text":"Okay food and good service.  The meatloaf was dry and the veggies had no flavor."}
{"text":"Food was good. I had the chicken fried steak. The potatoes tasted like mint however, kind of weird.   Great services from Violeta."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast. We made the mistake of going to IHOP on Vegas blvd for breakfast and it was awful. We searched for another restaurant and this one came up. We were pleasantly surprised. Excellent portions, the pancakes were delicious, fluffy. The sourdough toast was amazing, it's so easy to mess up toast but rare when it's perfectly toasted and buttered. The food was tasty across the board and the service was great. The only issue we had was that the hostess was a bit surly but our waitress was great."}
{"text":"We found yet another great place for breakfast in Las Vegas (although I'm certain you can get good lunch and dinner here, too).  The first thing I liked was the coffee was served in a ceramic mug with a saucer -- FINALLY, a place other than the table top on which to place my spoon-- and really good coffee!  Our waitress, Virginia, was friendly and efficient.  I ordered the Chilaquiles Verde and my husband had Huevos Rancheros.  The portions are so large (and reasonably priced) that I could only get through half of mine, which included tortilla chips smothered with Jack cheese and green verde sauce (spicy and tasty), topped with two eggs, Spanish rice and refried beans.  Don't forget to ask for the senior citizen discount, if you qualify as such."}
{"text":"Blueberry  hills breakfast wasn't anything to brag about. The size portion was great. The taste of the food Was OKAY. I'm a breakfast food lover and I can positively say that it wasn't the bomb.com.  The End"}
{"text":"Always cheap and fast. 24 hours a day. Our go to spot off the strip to get some late night diner food."}
{"text":"Very good bfast spot.  The menu is extensive, the decor is 70's diner and the service is old school.  The manager was total pimp daddy mac with his suit and fedora.  I had the guadalajara skillet, chorizo, cheese, onions, bell peppers, hash browns and tortilla chips.  It came with an excellent hot sauce, the menu should warn though that this dish is spicy, its got major kick.  The hubby had the blueberry pancake bfast that came with two honkin pancakes that had blueberry in the batter and on top.  I also enjoyed the coffee.  I do recommend this place, you will need a car or taxi to get there.  They are open 24 hours so you can get your grub on at any time.  Oh and don't let the horn scare you, I guess its played every hour so the employees remember to wash their hands!?!  I must also go back and try the homemade cakes on display, there were at least 6 in the case!"}
{"text":"I always end up in Las Vegas at least once a year for one reason or another. Decided to try something different for breakfast and I wasn't disappointed. The menu is overwhelming (in a good way). I had the Irish eggs Benedict and it was more than enough and very flavorful. Nice to find a place to get a good home cooked meal when you are traveling. I will be back."}
{"text":"This place is open 24 HOURS... So many people think it's just breakfast/brunch, but its not!   Service and quality is consistant, no matter if it's a weekday lunch, Sunday brunch (very very packed!) Or midnight coffee and pie (chocolate cream pie with oreo crust, anybody?) Ive always been met with a warm smile and friendly service. If anything is not right, tell them so they can fix it. Dont leave a bad review just because you decided to be grumpy and keep your problems to yourself. Any minor problems we've had were fixed so fast I don't remember what they were, and I've always left happy.   Its also GREAT for kids. This has become our family's go-to spot. Lots of kid's meal options (with a coloring page and crayons of course). And for extra picky eaters and tots, they even have a a la carte menu at the back where you can find things like a single pancake, cereal, oatmeal, fruit, rice and things like that. They've even brought out oyster crackers or saltines for babies who don't want to wait!"}
{"text":"Everything we had at our table was excellent. From the delicious and well proportioned granola pancakes, to the perfectly cooked eggs and potatoes which were not greasy!   The staff are really nice and accommodating (your coffee cup will not be empty) and the price was more than fair.  This place was a welcomed change of quality food at not-gougy prices after a week of opposite food experiences in Las Vegas. One of the bright spots in this city to me!"}
{"text":"As of January 22, 2016 this restaurant completely changed their wonderful menu -- eliminated the daily specials , raised prices , and shrunk the choices. Bad move. I hope the wonderful wait staff doesn't suffer when fewer customers dine here. Instead of eating here four times a week I may cut back to once a month just to stay in touch with folks."}
{"text":"Come to this location quite often, the food is always good & large portions.  On March 25, 2016 one of their breakfast specials was a California Benedict --awesome --ate the whole thing--will definitely order again!"}
{"text":"A step better than Denny's. Good prices. HUGE menu. Everything sounds good makes it hard to choose."}
{"text":"Do not heat here!! PHIL IS SO RUDE...even if you have 3 children with you! No customer service skills at all! Drive east 3 miles to the location on flamingo and Sandhill...don't waste your time here at this location!! Phil is the franchise owner for this \"family owned\" business location and I cannot begins to explain the rude unprofessionalism of this man! DO NOT EAT HERE!"}
{"text":"The food was good. I liked the honey coconut chicken and waffles. Their strawberry pancakes were good. The service was alright."}
{"text":"Every trip to Vegas at least once a year we try to find a off the strip diner to have breakfast and always end up back here.  Generous portions, great coffee, friendly locals and reasonable prices.   I always get an omelet and pancakes, usually the biggest plate I've ever seen for a side....."}
{"text":"Me and my hunnie loved this place soooo excited we are going to Vegas in a week first place we're going is here"}
{"text":"This place makes me wanna move to Las Vegas lol we had the best service our waitress was so nice and the food ohhhh the food is perfection=) the crepes were so good the fruit is fresh and the sweet creamy cheese inside is so good these are a must try if u come here=)"}
{"text":"Great diner food. Big portions, and tasty. Great selection with a big menu. Nice 50's feel without going overboard. Lot of bang for your buck. I'll be back."}
{"text":"This is my go to Place when we don't know where to go late at night. The menu is gigantic so you can literally find breakfast lunch or dinner at anytime day or night.This restaurant has a diner sort of atmosphere old-school it's not fancy at all just sort of in old Las Vegas Place with big portions for 24 hour service"}
{"text":"We had a great breakfast here. The prices at the hotels for food is kind of on the ridiculous side for crappy food. Our server Nancy was awesome and has been there for 19 years. She was so sweet!  The food was good and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Blue berry hill is an awesome restaurant, I really enjoyed their chorizo skillet! Their staff was also awesome! We did come in a group of 20 and I can imagine how hard that maybe to keep a family of 20 happy."}
{"text":"Came here with my family on a recent trip to Vegas, our waitress was very nice and humble and her service was incredibly fast. The food was amazing and the ambience made you feel cozy and at home. I would definitely return on another trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"Huge portions for waffles and pancakes. Great waffles -- crisp and light, even with mounds of ice cream and whipped cream. Especially good cinnamon raisin pancakes. Eggs and hash brown are only so-so. Service is spotty."}
{"text":"As far as I can tell, \"Family Restaurant\" means screaming children.    The wait-staff here were great.  My waitress was really nice, very attentive, and I really liked her.  This is where the positive experience ends.  The coffee tastes like dish-water.  (Very similar to say Denny's.)  I drank it because I was in need of caffeine, and wasn't terribly pleased.  I got the chicken and waffles, a couple of eggs, and an order of hashbrowns.  The chicken was grilled, not fried.  (I couldn't tell this from the menu, or I wouldn't have ordered it.)  The waffles were a bit overdone, and crunchy on the outside.  The inside seemed like so much vapor.  They lacked substance.  There was something like cinnamon-sugar dusted on the top of them.  (This seemed really weird to me, and didn't go with the chicken.)  The hash browns were cooked properly, but still seemed to lack flavor overall.  Add to that the fact that I didn't feel terribly great physically shortly after leaving (Indigestion?  I'm not sure.  I felt quesy and flushed.) I just wasn't happy with the experience."}
{"text":"I went there Easter sunday and I got sick on the turkey dinner ,I liked it before but hell I wont go no more .Turkey and mashed potatoes were cold under hot gravy yuck food poison"}
{"text":"Nice restaurant with great food. Desserts are awesome.. baked fresh daily.    Emma is a wonderfully friendly waitress...in the two years we have been eating at this Blueberry Emma has always had a welcoming smile... always friendly... ."}
{"text":"we went because we were looking for something close to our hotel and we are not familiar with the east side of town.   First of all the bus boy brought us water and FRESH hot coffee before we even sat all the way down. We decided to share food because it was a little more pricey than we had planned on spending, so i ordered a small fruit cup on the side also.   There was SO MUCH FOOD!! between the two of us sharing we could not even finish it! and our coffee never got below half a cup. The wait staff was ON IT! our service was great. Food was typical diner food but tasty as well. My husband ordered chicken fried steak and eggs, and I dont eat meat so he had them substitute egg whites for me and I STILL could not finish my portion!   If you are really hungry this is the place for you! We went on a Sunday morning about 730a.m. and it wasnt crowded at all. but they didnt have any specials either. the specials are only during the week. so over all we spent about 20 bucks, but there was a TON of food we left full and happy and the coffee was bomb!"}
{"text":"Giant plates, yummy food, reasonable prices. We come here for breakfast almost every time we are in Vegas. It's a good family restaurant. I recommend anything on the breakfast menu."}
{"text":"Decided to take the path less traveled and wound up at this joint.  (This is a good location if you're heading to the outlet mall!)  We were tired of all the upscale restaurants and overpriced grub on the strip.  Had the sampler which was $10 for 2 eggs, hash browns, 2 sausages, 2 bacon strips, 2 ham pieces and your choice of pancakes or french toast.  What a great deal!  Of course, how 'good' can you make the average eggs, bacon, sausage and ham?  They were average but the sausage was good!  I dont even like breakfast sausage and I ate these!  Had the french toast, WOW!  It was so tasty!!!!  My sister had ordered the cheese blintzes, and you could hear the clash from our forks fighting for the last pieces!  The decor is dated, but as long as it kept prices down it was all good on my end!  Service was excellent and my coffee cup was never empty!  Cannot wait to come back to sin city and have breakfast here again!"}
{"text":"Comfort Breakfast at its best  Came here for a hearty breakfast Sunday morning prior to leaving Vegas and glad I did. The menu was quite overwhelming sooo much to choose from. One thing I loved about their menu is everything is included in their meals they dont try to nickel and dime you for extras. All meals are complete for eg. you came for pancakes well you get pancakes, eggs, bacon and potatoes for under $12  My wife ordered the 1-2-3 biscuit meal after all she loves biscuits and gravy these were the best shes had. Meal came with 2 huge biscuits smothered in gravy along with bacon and eggs. Sh ordered a side of potatoes. The gravy was served thick with bits of sausages inside. The Biscuits were buttery, salty and Flaky; perfection. She also enjoyed the breakfast potatoes we asked for crispy potatoes blueberry did not dissapoint they were served hot, crispy outside soft inside.   I opted for the burger-steak with potato pancakes and eggs. Portion was HUUUUUGE! and deeeeeelicious. Loved the flavors all infused together. Biscuits on the bottom potato pancakes in the middle and burgersteak on top I asked for my gravy on the side. Get this one you will not finish it and you will not be dissapointed. The burgersteak was cooked perfectly goood steaky flavor. Potatoe pancakes were soft and crispy, again biscuits soft, salty and flaky with thick gravy; eggs were eggs honestly could have this meal without eggs sooo much food."}
{"text":"I wrote a long review and Yelp wouldn't log in and I lost it. Don't want to waste another moment on this place but really feel the need to warn others. Stopped here at 4am on my way home from dancing and anything would have tasted good. Except my meal was unedible, my friends had to be sent back. To top it off the prices are higher then overpriced IHOP and Dennys. Stay away from this place!"}
{"text":"This place was a disappointment.  I had an omlett and ordered blueberry pancakes since that's what their claim to fame is.  The pancakes came back with about 1/2 cup of cheap blueberry jam on it.  It was gross.  I expected fresh blueberries, not goop that comes in a 5 gallon can.  I'm sure if you have kids they would love it.  Too me this way way over rated.  Try the Egg & I, or make a trip to Henderson for the Cracked Egg.  That was my favorite.  The Bellagio Sunday Bruch was good considering what what you had to choose from, but these other two places had great food, and off strip prices.  If it's two adults looking for a nice breakfast, pass on Blueberry Hill you're not missing anything."}
{"text":"If you're looking for an old-fashioned diner with good eats, then you should be sure to come here.  My lovely wife and I went to the Bellagio for some later night Christmas entertainment (the Garden Conservatory and Fountain show), and stopped here on the way back home for a quick bite to eat.    Our waitress was FANTASTIC.  She was perfectly attentive, and very warm & friendly, especially since she had to work on Christmas night!  WELL DONE!    The food was delicious, and the bill fit our budget nicely.  A HUGE PLUS is that this location is open 24 hours--surprisingly for a town like Las Vegas, not all Blueberry Hill locations are open all night!  For a quick, delicious bite off-Strip and away from the hustle and bustle of tourists, come here.  You'll find mostly locals who aren't impressed with noisy drunkards and gluttons looking for the cheapest buffet.  There's lots of free parking, too.    To maybe even come close to a 5-star rating: 1. The facilities could use a remodel.  Nothing too crazy and huge, but just enough to distinguish this place from Denny's or IHOP.   2. Serve Coca-Cola products.  I prefer Coke over Pepsi, and I know that's a personal preference, but having both options really rocks for everyone who drinks soda!   3. Some of the products are on the cheap side.  (The shredded cheddar cheese is OBVIOUSLY processed cheese, and tastes like powdery American cheese.)  I know that the ingredients need to be cheaper to keep costs down, but hey, that's one thing that separates 4-star and 5-star establishments in my book."}
{"text":"This place has classic choices at reasonable prices.  The service was a little spotty, but again, the food is definitely worth a visit.  My wife's family and I stopped here for a bowl of hot soup on a cold day.  Most of us ordered the delicious chicken & smoked sausage gumbo, but my wife ordered the chicken noodle soup.  The ingredients aren't of expensive quality, but the taste makes up for it.  Check this place out for sure, you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Had been going to this place for years! Even bringing my family here when they came to visit. Really liked the prices, quality of food and the \"mom & pop \" atmosphere. Unfortunately my last few visits were not good... They have definitely lost the \" mom & pop\" quality and the customer service has gone way downhill! Blueberry downhill!!"}
{"text":"Visited Blueberry Hill the other day for lunch with a friend. It was surprisingly busy for 1pm on a Friday...but they were still definitely over staffed. Waiters seemed to just be standing around waiting for people to come in, so we thought we'd get good service. We were wrong. Once we were seated we took a look at the menu and took about 20 minutes to decide what we wanted. It took forever for us to actually get our food, and our waiter never checked back up on us once we ordered. It wasn't until my food arrived at my table that I got a refill on my drink. Wasn't too impressed with this location."}
{"text":"Mmmm good ol' fashion comfort food at its FINEST...  ..this place definitely deserves 4 stars! Oreo and Cinnamon Swirl Pancakes with a Grilled Cheese and Curly Fries...I'm in heaven!"}
{"text":"Some friends and I went to Blueberry Hill late one night and order a wife variety of entrees (steak dinner, pancakes, breakfast skillet, cheeseburger, and various other items). Everything was very good and so cheap! The steak was tender and cooked perfectly. The pancakes were phenomenal (I had apple cinnamon). The portions were large and the coffee was great, too. Our only complaint was the service. Once we got our food we didn't get visited by our waiter for a very long time.  We needed refills on our drinks and it took forever. We couldn't even flag down our waiter to get help. I recommend going for the food despite the service, but I warn you to be prepared for mediocre service. You may want to order two of your drink (or a carafe) just in case."}
{"text":"Love coming here. One of my favorite breakfast places. Great service an always great food. The breakfast here is off the hook.  I love the French Toast an the cinnamon swirl pancakes. They are a must try if you like either. The biscuits an gravy are also very good. The biscuits are homemade an huge, nice an fluffy, an the portions are huge. One biscuit can feed two people depending on how hungry you are. Everything I have ever ordered here from breakfast to lunch or dinner has been great. So if you haven't been here lately go..."}
{"text":"OH MY WORD! I really think I could marry their pancakes and live a happy, fulfilled life. In all seriousness, their buttermilk pancakes are absolutely amazing. They are big, fluffy, and full of flavor. I ordered the Country Breakfast with a side of hash browns and I had more than enough food. Although I have only been here for breakfast, they are open 24hours a day. Their dinner items do not look too appetizing so I think I will stick to visiting only for breakfast.  Blueberry Hill is located off the strip, is very inexpensive and has it's own parking lot. It isn't a fancy restaurant but the food definitely makes it's exterior appearance irrelevant."}
{"text":"I never order pancakes out anymore because I'm always disappointed when they're rubbery & not as good as I make at home.  NOT the case here! The multigrain pancakes are amazing!  It's true prices have gone up but I don't mind when you get four plate sized 1/2 \" high pancakes that are full of chunks of real nuts!  Enough that I pigged out & ate 2 & my two teens will split the rest after school! Definitely quality that's worth the money!  Their omelettes are great, hash browns never disappoint, if you're not a big eater be prepared to split or take home!  Yup Terry M! You were just doing it wrong be sure to try again! (Dudee, I don't eat chili out anywhere! LOL!)"}
{"text":"Came here based on people's review on yelp, food was very good and plentiful and the servers where nice and tentative to our request. Will be back again."}
{"text":"I don't think there's a bad dish at this restaurant.  I've been here countless times for what I consider the best breakfast in Vegas.  The menu is huge and the prices are low... never paid more than $10 for food here, and always leave stuffed.  Even tried a couple lunch dishes and was not disappointed with the quality or the portions.  I wish this place was walking distance from my house and not 6 miles away!!!"}
{"text":"Blueberry Hill knocked it out of the ballpark again! Hubby had the pancake combo and I had the denver skillet. Both so good! And Natalie is a pure joy! She makes the experience much better. Sit in her section!!"}
{"text":"Food was good but found it REALLY weird that this guy climbed up into the booth and started washing the windows.... probably not the right time!"}
{"text":"I loved the service and food here, portion are big and tasty, most the plates we ordered i did taste them they were great, very friendly service, this will my breakfast spot when I'm in Vegas"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of blueberry hill. The food is good ol comfort food. I can't comment on the lunch and dinner menu because i'm exclusive to breakfast items only.  I usually get the eggs benedict and while its not the best in the city it does its job of filling my belly while being edible. Their hollandase is sorta heavy for my taste but good none the less. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Love the options for kids. Waitress was so nice she got me cookies for my daughter to dip with milk. She customized my dinner. I really recommend for picky kid eaters."}
{"text":"Popeyes chicken... absolutely loved the mashed potatoes and gravy. Swiss cheese covered chicken breast needed a little more seasoning. Staff was very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I don't know how they make their pancakes, nor am I a big pancake eater, but these were the best pancakes I ever had in my life. My family and I really enjoyed our breakfast here on our vacation."}
{"text":"Legitimately the best curly fries I have ever had in my entire life. Basically did a full sample of the menu. The other night the homies and I had the chicken tenders with Alfredo (10/10), the patty melt (9.9/10), and the meat loaf (9.3/10). Overall we got a real diner experience complete with pies. Service was fast, and our server's phone went off while I was ordering and it was a luaghy taffy remix sooooo I'm completely happy about that!   Overall the food was banging, and the service was turnt."}
{"text":"went back for breakfast after a long hiatus.  I must say, the place has really stepped it up.  CBH with scrambled eggs.  sounds basic and simple, but these are two breakfast items that are hard to do right.  the hill is successful.  the CBH is traditional and grilled with a nice crunch on the exterior (a must).  the eggs were cooked perfectly.  not runny like snot, or overcooked like rubber.  a very pleasant surprise. service was excellent."}
{"text":"I had a hankering for some pancakes at around 12:30 AM last friday night, so I got on my bicycle and rode the 5.7 miles down the road to Blueberry Hill.  The restaurant was in a fairly nice section of town. I felt safe locking my bicycle there to a street sign in the middle of the night, so I thought it was very safe. I went inside. The restaurant was quiet, since it was so late, but it was also very clean, and the people working there were all very nice.  I ordered the chicken sausage pigs in a blanket. It was OUT OF THIS WORLD. These are the best pancakes I have ever eaten in my entire life. The chicken sausage is delicious- it's one of my favorite things to buy from Whole Foods, so I'm so happy that they use it here at Blueberry Hill! But these pancakes are killer! They are gigantic and about a half inch thick. Don't be put off by their prices. When they say three pigs in a blanket, they mean three gigantic pancakes. I brought home my leftovers in a box and ate them for three days.  I can't wait to try the rest of their menu. So happy to find an amazing hometown diner here in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"food was amazing! Lisa was such a sweet funny waitress! Recommend going to this place!!!"}
{"text":"We stopped in here randomly after flying in to Vegas early one morning for a quick weekend - passed this place while on the way to our hotel.  We were looking for a diner or family-style restaurant to get a full, filling breakfast before the craziness of the weekend.   The place was packed & the parking lot too - must be a sign the food is awesome.  Despite the amount of people, we easily found a parking spot in the extra large attached lot & we were quickly seated inside.  They have fresh baked muffins and the blueberry one was huge and amaaaaaaaazing.  It came out hot & with a dish of whipped butter.  My mom and I made a meal of that before our actual breakfast plates came out.  We saw a ton of huge (we're talking 2\" thick) pancakes floating by to other tables and if we ever come back, we are totally getting them.  They also have really large cakes up front...at least 6\" tall!    Plenty of booths & tables + counter seating.    Come here hungry!"}
{"text":"We come here once or twice a year.  We used to be here often for breakfast, but that went away when so many more choices opened nearer home.  We go that once or twice now for dinner.  I had the Popeye chicken--a chicken breast with spinach on top covered with cheese.  My wife had their parmesan crusted chicken breast.  We both enjoyed our chicken, but I do wish they'd get some vegetable other than canned green beans.  Both dinners were on their limited time $7.77 menu.  For the price you get  soup or salad, dinner, drink, and dessert.   It can't be beaten!"}
{"text":"After a short hike at the Clark County Wetlands Park, my friend and I had planned to go to Blueberry Hill for breakfast.  Thinking the closest one was near UNLV, I put this address on my GPS and it turned out top be much closer to where we were than going to near Maryland and Flamingo which was more convenient for both of us.  We were brought coffee quickly as we studied the menu.  My order was for a Texas chili omelette with hash browns and rye toast.  My friend ordered the chicken apple compote waffle.  We had some time to chat but it wasn't long before our breakfasts were brought.  My omelette was served open-faced with the egg on the cooked egg on the bottom and topped with chili, onions, and cheese.  There is a choice of sides and I got hash browns and rye toast.  My friend's waffle was in quarters--each topped with a small breaded, fried piece of chicken breast, and topped with apple compote.  I left much of the potatoes, a slice of toast, but my friend finished his waffle.  Portion sizes have always been large at Blueberry Hill.  We enjoyed a good breakfast.  Blueberry Hill is good diner food.  It's the first time I've been to one in about 5 years, and I'm glad this was the place chosen by my friend for our after hike breakfast get together."}
{"text":"I thought I was pretty familiar with Las Vegas. For several years growing up, it was my home away from home. As it turns out, there are a few places that I've been missing out on all this time.   Blueberry Hill is one of them. Thankfully it's open 24 hours, otherwise we'd be going to some shady or overpriced place to get some grub at 1 in the morning after flying into Sin City at a late flight.   We were immediately sat, which was a relief and something of a surprise; there seems to be fewer 24/7 spots the farther you get from The Strip, but the place had people, but wasn't packed. Inside basically looks like what an old IHOP would look like, except their mascot, which is a boy in overalls having more than a good time pouring a bucket of blueberries all over himself adorns the interior.   The menu has a great selection of stuff on both sides of one menu panel. Breakfast is served all day, and their non-breakfast items are pretty well varied as well. Prices and portions are adequate, but definitely not the best deal. But the food is good! I had the biscuits and gravy, which was the second best I've had in a while, and they have very, very delicious fries. Food comes out fairly quickly, even though the actual service isn't the quickest.   Though we're apart...I'll still return to Blueberry Hill next time I'm back in town for sure."}
{"text":"This restaurant deserves 5 stars because they have my favorite brand of music. I would come here every once in a while. Maybe I should stop by on my day off and grab some lunch. The food is really good and the staff is completely awesome.. I love this restaurant."}
{"text":"Stopped at this place on our way to the airport.  What a surprise.  The cinnamon swirl pancakes were the best I ever have had.  It came with eggs, sausage and hash browns.  Every thing was cooked perfectly.  My wife had the chicken omelet, which was big enough to feed two easily.  Service was great. The place was very busy and run very well.  A must stop every time I come to Vegas."}
{"text":"3rd time here first time reviewing. Large selection on the menu got the eggs benidict & blueberry crepes fast efficient service & great food!"}
{"text":"This is a Classic American restaurant Big wholesome meals with Rock n Roll music  The menu is massive with good images to understand what you will be getting.  We tried the Fried Chicken and Big Shake - It was spot on 5/5 no question high quality chicken and the Vanilla Shake was just right.  Only concern was the service, it was slow, we had to wait for more than 20 mins to get our food. The Kitchen probably was backed up - but when the food came out, it was outstanding. That is the only reason loss of one star.   Will be back for sure.  Thank you"}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday what a mistake the parking is horrific the service pretty good but my canned hash and grossly cooked eggs was inedible pancakes good though my sons chicken noodle soup was appalling and he much like \"Mikey\" normally eats anything.  My other son had the chicken and dumpling special and he was very happy with his which is why they got 3 stars 1 for service and 2 for the food"}
{"text":"We tried this place after reading reviews on Yelp.  I'm so glad we went --DEFINITELY will eat here again!!  We went just before we returned to LA.  It's not flashy or pretentious, it's down to earth and comfortable.   Pros:   EASY to find/get to from the strip BEST French a Toast ever!  (Our waitress said so and I had to confirm) BEST Patty Melt ever! (friend's order) BEST French fries (friend's order... I confirmed) Attentive wait staff Reasonable pricing Fresh, home style cooking  Cons: Can't think of any"}
{"text":"Another victory for Yelp. I was in Vegas recently and wanted to find a decent place for breakfast. Eating on the strip is almost always overpriced and disappointing. I got on Yelp from my cell phone and found a Blueberry Hill restaurant nearby.  This place did not disappoint. They have a ton of options and everything was good. The blueberry pancakes were good, the biscuits and gravy were good and we had an enormous meal for three for about $30 including drinks. This place is a great deal and it's close to the strip. Skip the casinos when you're hungry for breakfast and head here instead."}
{"text":"So every casino has a grill that serves breakfast.  So although I love to get out and explore the LV foodie scene, I have neglected the diner-type establishments.  So after attending the Elton John Million-Dollar Piano show, my family was looking for some comfort food.  Wow!, Did we ever find the place!  It was not that crowded at 11 PM (Open 24) on January 1st.  When I picked up the menu, I didn't expect it to be as thick as Melville's Moby Dick, but it was!  This may be the most extensive menu that I have ever seen.  I talked my wife out of the spaghetti, b/c it just didn't seem like an Italian place...but trust me, they even have a page or two of Italian specialties.  My son had a Chicken and Apple Compote Waffle dish, while I had the Meatloaf with sausage gravy with bacon on a biscuit....CULINARY GENIUS.  We did not have room for desert, but the pies and baked goods looked amazing.  This could be the best diner in LV, I know that I am not looking any further!"}
{"text":"I am a regular at the Peppermill every time we visit Vegas. A friend recommended this place and I thought we would give it a try.  Well worth it. The wait time was 30 minuets, which is not far off of what the wait time usually is at the mill. The menu options were insanely huge and the food was amazing. The gravy itself could give you a heart attack, but worth it.  Dine or Dash? I will definitely dine. Sorry Peppermill...."}
{"text":"Headed out of Vegas looking for a family breakfast diner.  Saw this place on yelp to give it a try.    It was just okay.   The pancakes were not that good.   The krustez at home tastes better.  We were a little disappointed.   The bacon tasted fake too....just not top notch in their quality of food."}
{"text":"Excellent! Our server was friendly & timely, we had breakfast. Blueberry Hill has the very best pancakes, It tastes like they have a starter dough that they keep going. My daughters ask to visit for breakfast every time they're in town.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"You ever hear that phrase \"Party in my mouth.\"  Yeah, you know you have and this place hits that to a freakin' tee.  We used to come here at least weekly until we realized we needed to slow down before we become unhealthy and \"supersized\".  So, over the past 2 years here is what I have to say:  You can't go wrong with ANY of their breakfast items.  Speaking for myself, I am not a breakfast food eater.  I can't stand pancakes, waffles, and french toast.  But this place...WOW!  I don't know what kind of \"magical ingredients\" they put into these items but I have become addicted, along with my family.  Their crepes, especially the fresh fruit, are...are...I have no words!  You'll just have to try everything on the menu!   As for the regular food items, I definitely wouldn't order a salad.  They use iceberg lettuce and we all know that's usually no bueno.  Their chili is good but their hamburger with chili on it is...BAM...good (throw some onions and jalapeno peppers on it).  I've had the spaghetti - meh.  I hear the coconut chicken is good but haven't tried it.  Like I said, this place is our go to place for our bfast outing day or night.  The price is right (usually under $10) for the portions you get (usually GINORMOUS).  They have great meal deals for the kids (3PM-9PM) and daily specials deals as well.  The 5 star rating is for the breakfast menu, fast service and friendly, personable waitresses."}
{"text":"So many options to choose from. Pleasant service! Food came quickly and was just as ordered. Will definitely come back, despite staying on the strip - it was easily accessed. Kudos!"}
{"text":"Best pancakes in town!  I grew up eating at blue berry hill.  They're open 24/7. Breakfast is served all day. Everything is made from scratch. Big portions and DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"Fresh hot coffee, warm & friendly staff, delicious home-style food, Blueberry Hill has always been like a home for me.   From the outside it doesn't look like a huge, 5 star chain restaurant, but it's even better than IHOP or Denny's hands down. I had an amazing chicken waffle breakfast and it was an incredibly delicious and filling meal! The staff was very attentive and very efficient. It's a great place to enjoy a meal with relatives, for breakfast early in the AM or after a long shift at work. The ambience allows you to relax and settle down after a busy day. I love coming to Blueberry Hill and highly recommend it over any other chain restaurants of similar variety."}
{"text":"Came for breakfast and it was so good! I had the french toast with bacon. Bacon was nice and crispy (not limp). Food came out very quick which was nice too! The decor needs to be upgraded tho."}
{"text":"This is the Irish Benedict on potato pancakes instead of English muffins. The Irish has corned beef hash instead of Canadian bacon. The potatoes are hashed and browned, the alternative is frozen deep fried potato squares. The hashbrowns are really good. This is by far my favorite breakfast restaurant. I've been all over the country and this is certifiably delicious, delicious is actually my favorite ingredient and breakfast is too important to not have any delicious in it. This is especially so being that it's in Las Vegas and a good breakfast is key to proper hangover recovery. Do not hesitate in coming here, the menu is huge and the price is not."}
{"text":"OK we came here for a great and not expensive breakfast and wow we were impressed. Everything we had was great here. I had the chorizo omelet and a side of amazing pancakes. Also the mimosas are MASSIVE! this place is open 24/7 which surprisingly is the only breakfast place besides dennys which is open at all hours. This is our new must eat place when we visit Vegas."}
{"text":"Chilaquiles and Huevos Rancheros. Good!  Service was excellent; waitress kept mug and glass full. Much better choice than Denny's :). Five stars since perfect post-gambling, obviously popular with the locals and the food is reasonably priced & plentiful portions."}
{"text":"When you go to Las Vegas as a tourist, you go to the strip or maybe Fremont, or, if you're exceptionally bizarre, one of the hundred floating smaller casinos orbiting in the cash-burdened gravity of the big hotels.   And when you read five star reviews, you expect L'Atelier or Carnevino or any of the other big name establishment restaurants monikered by a big-time chef.  You'd be right to, and this isn't an attack on those places, places that offer some of the best eating in the country.  Instead, this is in praise of the café, of the appreciably local, of what separates Flamingo, Tropicana and Fremont from what is otherwise an ordinary American town.    Blueberry Hill is that place, an excellent café with experienced wait staff, quality food, and without the adornments you find in more classically targeted tourist locations.  The plates are the same speckled white-ish gray you seem to find in these places but no where else.    We went with the biscuits and gravy, coffee and the waffle with blueberries.  Everything was fantastic.  It all came out hot and we all left stuffed.  Blueberry Hill is quickly becoming an every trip stop, despite - or maybe because of - it's off-strip location and its complete lack of Vegas-style bells and whistles."}
{"text":"5 stars all the way, every time.  This is my go-to Blueberry Hill of all their locations.  Tried and true.  Chefs are always on-point and always get it right the first time.  Old school diner experience done to perfection, attention to every detail even the fresh hot potato of coffee.  The wait staff was all helpful sitting at the breakfast bar, Jocelyn, Jessica and Jennifer.  Juan, the manager, runs a tight ship.  I'm very happy with how clean this location is, even the bathrooms."}
{"text":"Want a break from the casinos and a good breakfast.  This is it.  My kids and I loved it.  Great food and great service that won't break the bank."}
{"text":"I can only vouch for breakfast here. It wasn't just good, it was damn good. Woke up craving something sweet. This place delivered. I ordered the Four Cheese Fresh and Fruity French Toast with a side of eggs and hash browns. It hit the spot."}
{"text":"First time here and I must say that this is one of the best places to come in Vegas. Being that I came at 1:30 in the morning the food was still so fresh! I love family owned restaurants, that are not \"train restaurants\". If you haven't been here before you should definitely try it!! Our server was AMAZING! The little things are what matter. Just by making me a fresh pot of coffee.  It's the employees who really make a difference. S/o to the grill cook!! Thanks to our server, TINA!"}
{"text":"Blueberry Hill has a lot on their menu.  You have so many options here.  There's so many choices, that it can get a bit overwhelming and that's a good thing.  I first step foot in a Blueberry Hill about 15+ years ago.  Before this week, it's been over 5 years since I dined here. Why so long between visits?  Well, it's because the wait is usually long and there's so much more breakfast options out here.  If you don't know me by now, then that's your bad.  If you do, then you know that I love eating breakfast type food for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  I would eat steak & eggs 6 times a day if I could. Obviously, I recently dined here for breakfast.  Obviously, I had some form of steak and eggs.  I had their Steak Omelet, which is 6 oz. of steak, 4 eggs, and a cup of cheese.  Hash browns and pancakes is also included.  Price is perfect at around $15.  My meal was very satisfying and most importantly, filled me up for the next couple of hours.  Am I a fan?  I use to be.  There's just a lot more options out here than there was 15 years ago.  Besides, Blueberry Hill doesn't need my Yelp review to boost their sales.  The lines are still long and the restaurant is still packed.    TIP -Night Owls have it good with their late night specials for only $6.95.   -The Patty Melt was my go-to back in the day -Check your bill.  They still add your check via calculator.  You're one fat finger away from being overcharged."}
{"text":"Blueberry Hill Family Restaurant - East Flamingo Road  It's been years since I've stepped foot inside this Blueberry Hill.  But in the last week, I have been here twice. I was with a co-worker both times and we wanted something simple that fit both of our dietary needs.  One thing that's consistent with Blueberry Hill is their huge portions, great prices, and a menu with a decent selection of breakfast food.  On both visits, I got their Wild West Omelette for $11.89.  This omelet is made with 4 large eggs, slices of bacon, diced ham, and a ton of cheese. The description on their menu even states \"a lot of cheese\" is in their Wild West Omelette.  This omelet fit my diet perfect since it's high in protein and super high in fat.  This is one greasy omelet and I loved it.  The entire dish is hooked up with either a choice of pancakes or toast with hash browns.  The hash brown are okay and the pancakes are worth coming back for.  As for the service, we had a great experience on visit #2 and so-so service on visit #1.  I guess you can't win them all.  Overall, I will probably be back because I know what to expect and that's your typical breakfast dishes, great portions, and affordable prices."}
{"text":"THE BEST FRENCH TOAST I HAVE EVER HAD. It was so fluffy and delicious, a little bit of cinnamon maybe? Great service, and the wonderful warm feeling of a Mom and pop dinner. I hope to work in Vegas again just to come back here for the French toast."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite diners to eat at! I would come here about once a week when I lived in Vegas, so I was able to try many of their items on their very large menu. Although they have several of these restaurants in town, I would regularly go to the one on Flamingo and Maryland Parkway. This location is open 24/7.  I've come here first thing in the morning and late in the afternoon. During the weekend and during the work week and they never seemed to be too busy. Yes of course Sundays they are pretty packed for breakfast, but I've never had to wait to be seated. I staff here are very quick to clean tables and to seat people, so to keep the flow running smoothly and to make sure no one has to wait too long.   Every time I've been here, I always feel welcome and like a valued customer. The waitress/waiter are always very friendly and helpful with any questions that you may have. They make suggestions based off of what you like or looking for. They are very familiar with the menu and can help with anything you ask. Orders are taken quickly and food is brought out in a very timely manner. Even on busy days, I don't think I've waited more then 5-10 minutes for my food.   First thing I should mention about their food is that the portions are HUGE!! I wish they offered half orders as I was never able to finish anything that I ordered. Most of their items come with sides, so that even makes for more food. Not complaining as I'd rather have more and take home what I didn't eat, then to leave till hungry.  One of my favorite things to order here was their skillets. I've had the Meat lover's, Denver and Sausage skillets. All of the are so delicious!! Made with their potatoes, peppers, onions and the different meat based off of the one you pick and eggs. I always did the over easy eggs. All of their skillets come with tortillas. You can ask for corn or flour. I preferred the corn.   Another favorite of mine was their Turkey BLT with a side of curly fries. Sandwich was perfectly made, with just the right amount of everything. I would eat maybe half of this sandwich as it's ginormous. The fries are perfectly made and are just right crispy.  Some of the many other things I've tried here is their French toast, Meatloaf sandwich (not a fave of mine as I'm not big on meat), Chicken noodle soup, baked ham and cheese sandwich, Egg Benedict (another great item), several of their omelettes, pancakes (delicious), wraps and their Chicken cutlet and spinach fettuccine Alfredo. Most of the items I've tried here are well cooked and tasty. I can't really remember anything negative about any of the food as far as how it was prepared. I may not have liked something because of personal preference.   The staff make sure to keep the place looking clean. When someone leaves, they clean up right after them, even sweep under tables. This is something I like to see, as I've been to many places that even though the tables may be cleaned off, the floor under it is full of food and napkins. Bathrooms are always cleaned and stocked with the necessary items.   Will come back when I'm back in town!!  Thanks you to the staff for making my experience here always a pleasant one."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. Best old school feeling diner in town. Staff is always super friendly. The cooks are always spot on, and the atmosphere is always full of chatty customers enjoying their meals."}
{"text":"My Fiance and I went there twice and the both times we went there for breakfast the food was so delicious and hearty. The plates are big and you will have to take home some of it. The prices are reasonable for the amount of food they serve on your plate. I will visit again."}
{"text":"Hidden gem. Friendly staff. The selection of breakfast, lunch, dinner and desserts is endless. The amount of food they serve is pretty much guarantees left overs even for the healthiest appetites. All meals are very affordable. Best of all the food quality is high and very tasty."}
{"text":"The location with the best cooks! Food looks just like the pictures on the menu. Very consistent. . ."}
{"text":"I take that all back. The food was terrible this last time I went. It seems as if they raise the prices and lowered the quality. I remember when you would have to wait in line to get in here on a Saturday morning and this time half the place was empty. Tsk, tsk."}
{"text":"Visiting Las Vegas and want a great breakfast? Go here! This place is so good that I'm back again today (was here yesterday). The Dixie Meatloaf is amazing and the French Toast and waffles are to die for! I recommend taking delicious homemade blueberry muffins to go. Seriously wonderful wait staff-fast, efficient, nice and great at refills. The place seems like a long wait but they have a great system and I was in less than 5 minutes."}
{"text":"Breakfast was delicious. My crepes and the corn beef skillet was amazing. Many options to choose from.  Will be back."}
{"text":"We come to Vegas once a year and always start our vacation at Blueberry hill. The food is always good and the portions are big enough to satisfy ANY appetite. The service is stellar. We always ask to be seated in Susie's station. She is very attentive and our order is always correct. We've been seeing Suzie for years and she makes us feel like we're at home. We consider her a friend. Do yourself a favor and go to Blueberry Hill. Make sure to ask for Susie. You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Place is dirty the tables and floors but in this side of town this is what you will find. The Food was great the french toast was great. The hot cakes was great service was good. If your not a clean freak and your pressed for time and close by  stop in and pig out"}
{"text":"I love the customer service and all but the food suckssssss!!! Parking is little to none, pretty dangerous to park here. The food was very mushy. I ordered the Tennesse Fried Steak &Two Eggs. My bf ordered the Irish Egg Benedict. We also had a side of pancakes, hash brown and blueberry french toast.   Tennesse Fried Steak&eggs- the steak was very mushy. As if i was eating mash potatoes texture. It wasn't medium rare like I asked and was very bland. I had to pretty much drench it with A1 sauce because of how bland it was. Not good at all. 1/5  Egg Benedict- it was okay. 3/5 not the best. Just alright. Not much of a fan of the potatoes below the benedict.   Hashbrown- pretty bland as well, but nothing a little salt cant save. Pretty crunchy and was pretty good to me. 4/5  Pancakes- undercooked, thick and pretty salty. Not good at all. I have a picture to prove how mushy it is. After cutting into it, the pancake just broke up. 1/5 won't even take this in a to go box.   French toast- 4/5 this was pretty good. A little mushy and too much blueberry syrup/jam that it drenched yhe feench toast making it mushy. However, it was pretty decently good."}
{"text":"My husband and I were craving pancakes..so using our new \"HTC\" (our first smart phone, and our first joint phone since we got married 2 weeks ago), we searched for the nearest pancake restaurant on our way to the airport! and we stumbled across this and we were not disappointed! We had blueberry and strawberry pancakes! they were sooo fluffy and sooo tasty...it was the perfect place for our pancake craving! love it! oh, and their grilled ham on the side was perfectly salty to accompany our sweet pancakes (or maybe i was just really hungry, but i enjoyed their ham!)"}
{"text":"Great family breakfast. Server Diana was super attentive and helpful. Generous portions: the Blueberry pancakes with blueberry compote and the ham and cheese omelette can feed us for breakfast tomorrow, too. Love the blueberry pancakes. Super fluffy."}
{"text":"Heard about this place numerous times and today finally got a chance to stop by.   The food and service are spot on.  Prices are reasonable and service is fast. The atmosphere is so welcoming, you really get that family cozy feeling.   I am def coming back for lunch"}
{"text":"This is a good spot. The service in here is good. It's a lot of Hispanic people but they are nice and on it. It's great service, this is the place where I first discovered the well done French toast. It's got the down home feeling and this is in my opinion the best blueberry hill because of the service and attn to detail."}
{"text":"This place is where I first discovered. Blueberry hill. But as of now this is the old school spot. The service in here is cool not the best. It's full of the golden girls, and some are sweet as others aren't. I think this place is unique and I wouldn't say I would never go here but of the 3 I'd probably choose this one last. It's amazing how a franchise differs"}
{"text":"Walked in waited to be seated and was pointed to our table. For a party of 2 we were sat at big round booth. It was awkward. Our server Hugo brought us water to start and didn't really say anything after. The food is great service not so much. Big portions to share!"}
{"text":"Nice family restaurant with a good breakfast, excellent coffee and really good service. We will definitely be back if we get the chance to visit vegas again"}
{"text":"It your neighborhood family style restaurant.  The cinnamon swirl pancakes were, meh, it just just alright for me.  The restaurant needs a major renovation...it needs to be modernized.  The service was excellent and you feel very homey there."}
{"text":"We've eaten at this location more than a few times for breakfast and dinner, but tonight will be the last time. They consistently get orders incorrect and we've overlooked it on past occasions, but tonight was the worst experience ever. The cups of chili were cold to lukewarm, we had dirty silverware on our table, and the waitress was totally disinterested, never re-filled our sodas and refused to make even minor adjustments to our sandwiches like changing out sautéed onions for raw onions on a patty melt. It was almost laughable that she had to refer to the menu to see which burger we were referring to when my husband ordered a simple double cheeseburger.  She was poorly trained and argumentative. I had to send a patty melt back for being undercooked and topped with the wrong type of cheese. I got it back with a few flakes of unmelted shredded cheddar. The flakes of cheese on the burger were not melted and those stuck to the bread were burnt black. The fries were cold. The plate of food looked messy and unappetizing. I requested a manager and was told none were on duty. Now I understand why this chain is closing store by store. They have definitely lost interest in quality of food and customer service."}
{"text":"This review is only about my favorite meal which is breakfast and they serve this 24 hours a day !! I wish I could say I experimented with other items but 90% of time I get the same thing , the meat lovers skillet extra egg ( over medium ) and extra cheese , here I'm a creature of habit and rarely differ from this order anytime of day !! here's why , country potatoes cooked to perfection and well seasoned , with peppers and onions , and a huge helping of breakfast sausage , ham and bacon all diced into very large chunks, topped off with melted cheddar cheese!! I usually get it with a biscuit which are large and fluffy and a side of country gravy that is thick and flavorful ( especially if you come for lunch or dinner , for me the thicker the better ) , their pancakes are also a good choice as they are huge and make a good compliment when slathered in butter or the occasional sourdough toast also slathered in butter , lol . I usually ask for a side of their homemade salsa to give it all a little kick . The service here has always been good except one time late next night . FYI this usually is an expensive breakfast as all the add ons are extra $'s but it all is cooked to perfection and if you want cheap there is always McDonald's breakfast !!"}
{"text":"I used to like Blueberry Hill but something has changed in the few years since I last ate here.  It was just lacking a certain something.  Oh yeah.  Quality.  I went in around 5:30 in the evening and the restaurant was basically empty.  That should have been my first clue.  I ordered a meatball sandwich with fries and a dinner salad.  The salad came out first and was nothing special.  I had Italian dressing and it was far to oily.  Hardly any vinegar to speak of.  It left a weird coating in my mouth that was rather unpleasent.  But I ate it because I don't like wasting food.  My meatball sandwich and fries came out looking impressive but was a bit underwhelming when I ate it.  Sure, there were a lot pf big meatballs on a nice sized roll.  And there was just the right amount of sauce.  Meat sauce to be precise.  No shortage of meat here.  The issue I had with this sandwich is that it wasn't hot.  Just luke warm.  The cheese had already coagulated.  How long was this thing under the heat lamp?  At least the fries were good.  Though after eating the oily salad and the luke warm sandwich I was too full to eat all of my fries.  I guess that is a mark in the win column.  I was full."}
{"text":"A little pricey for a diner but big portions and friendly staff! It's also a local chain which i like - it's important to support local business! Would recommend"}
{"text":"My blueberry pancakes were late to the table but I'm a patient man. They were so late in fact that my meal was free. No complaints because my breakfast was declisous."}
{"text":"I ordered breakfast through Grubhub. I had crepes with eggs and turkey sausage. Excellent customer service. I was called twice from restaurant to make sure I had the right order. Once by the deliver person as well. The delivery person was really cool. Now to the important part. The food was amazing. I loved everything. The eggs were seasoned perfectly. Turkey sauce wasn't dry at all. I wasn't expecting 4 sausage patties. Score!!! Now to the crepes. OMG!!!! They were so delicious. Texture, the perfect amount of fruit. Very happy. Oh and I also had OJ and lemonade. Very tasty."}
{"text":"This location is notoriously slow but the food is good, so as long as you're not in a rush you will be okay. The waitresses are not the most pleasant people, it's a diner so they want you in and out and don't even try to sit and wait for your party to arrive they either won't let you sit or they will hound you. I ordered coffee and waited for 20 minutes for my friend. I planned to order a full breakfast but the waitress was so rude I left, my friend pulled up with 2 more friends and we all left. They just lost a party of 4 because she was so busy ( lots of empty tables by the way)"}
{"text":"I have only had breakfast, and while breakfast is not my favorite meal; when I do have breakfast,  this where I go. Nothing special about the place except consistently very good food, and friendly service."}
{"text":"Good Value ....Good pancakes.... Close to strip...big and varied menu.  Not a great area...has weird smell coming from restroom area (??).  Party of four.... all liked it ....and the others didn't notice smell...so ??  Again good pancakes ...  ha ha"}
{"text":"Best pancakes i've ever had, so good i can't imagine eating pancake anywhere else.  Soft, Fluffy, Moist. You know what determine's a good pancake is when you pour syrup on it and it absorbs it like a sponge!  I had the fresh apple pancakes and they were delicious! no need for syrup.   Clean diner and friendly service. Famous for their pancakes and gives great helpings.  Next time must order their oreo pancakes!"}
{"text":"Blueberry hill is my favorite diner in Las Vegas.  Unlike Denny's whose food only tastes good after a night of boozing and cruising; the food here is good in an inebriated state or sober.  My favorite dish is the half pound ground steak that is covered with bacon and cheese.  Another plus for Blueberry Hill is that they don't use the fakin bacon that never gets crispy.  The most important tip is to avoid.this place on Saturday and Sunday morning, due to the influx of tourists and they're annoying ways."}
{"text":"You must check this place out when your in Vegas!!!  Great food. Great service. Fast fast fast."}
{"text":"Food was good service was friendly nancy was very attentive and happy. The only downfall was we waited and were out on a list and a breakfast bar opened up and a man walked in and took our spot. I spoke to someone about it and he said I just stay out of it. We were waiting longer then the man and he just swooped in and took the spot. I wasn't very happy with that but we got seated about 10 mins or less after that so it was fine. I also saw its first come first serve at the bar so you kinda have to wait right behind people and I don't like doing that.  But the meal was pleasant I got he Irish breakfast eggs bene. Was yummy. Oj was good and the coffee was pretty decent. Overall 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"Had this for a hearty breakfast before a convention. Held me over all day! Great place to get away from the strip."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review because I really miss their down home cookin'. The variety of food and the quantity is more than enough to satisfy everyone. The service is excellent. When I go down next month to hang out I will definitely stop by for some breakfast. Happy!"}
{"text":"I didn't expect to like this place so much, I usually avoid pancake houses and the such, but the whole family was pleased. That's not easy to do. I have to give these guys five stars even though it's not my kind of food, being mostly vegan and all... The server knew what was in everything and obliged my requests for a healthy breakfast, while the rest of the family gorged on huge plates of stuff I've stopped eating a ling time ago. Quickly made, prompt service, makes food the way you want it. Props."}
{"text":"This place is great. We go here for breakfast at 3 am after a fun night out or we come here for normal hours breakfast too, it's always good and the service is usually very good. Can't go wrong here and highly recommend."}
{"text":"Nice place with a diner feel to it. Excellent for big groups! They have pretty big portions for a fair price. I can highly recommend the chicken and waffles as a solid choice! You won't be hungry til dinner!"}
{"text":"While in Vegas a few weeks ago, a friend and I were the first one's awake and decided we'd go somewhere off The Strip for breakfast. My friend said that Blueberry Hill was a great family owned restaurant, and since I'm all for supporting local businesses, I was game.  We grabbed the last 2 seats at the counter because we didn't feel like waiting for a booth. This turned out to be a good call... less than 5 minutes later, the line spilled out into the parking lot which seemed like a sign that this place was the bees-knees.    EH.   The menu is expansive and resembles the 25 page menu at The Cheesecake Factory where you're presented with so many options that you're incapable of making a decision.   Pricing was very reasonable by Vegas standards.  I ordered the Philly Cheese Steak omelet ($11-$12) which turned out to be filled with sinewy beef portions. It wasn't horrible, it just took too much effort. The portions, however, are gargantuan and worthy of splitting with a friend.   They serve a decent cup of coffee, along with all the flavored creamers you could ask for.   Essentially, Blueberry Hill is a glorified IHOP. I don't necessarily mean that in a negative way because I love IHOP pancakes and will likely serve them at my wedding reception someday. However, I can assure you that you won't be laying on your death bed wishing you patronized Blueberry Hill at some point in your life. But, if you're hungover in Vegas and just need quick sustenance, you've found your place."}
{"text":"Left without eating.  Restaurant was empty and waitress would not let us move to a little bigger table.  Poor service."}
{"text":"OK sooo...whenever I come to Vegas, I go to this restaurant to have BANANA pancakes...they are normally good, as is the service but today...SO NOT!  First off I had to keep asking for water...Secondly our waitress seem to forget about us...Third got my food it was cold...Fourth, had to get up to ask the waitress for warm food, and she had the nerve to ask me, \"do you want me to put it in the microwave\"..WHAT..NO i want fresh food...FIFTH waited 7minutes finally got up and told her to forget my order...  THE FINAL STRAW....I SAW ANOTHER GUEST POINT TO A BUG, NOT A FLY, NOT A NAT, A BUG ON THEIR TABLE!!!  GROSSSSSSSSSSS...I GOT UP, went to go and pay..and all that was said was, \"ya that happens sometimes\"...GROSSSSSSSSS  NEVER GOING BACK...IF YOU GO BRING YOUR BUG SPRAY!"}
{"text":"I don't know what the food taste like because I did not stay. I met up with friends here in Vegas for the Rodeo Nationals. So on my way to Mesa, AZ, I decided to stop for breakfast. The hostess was an older lady and did not say anything except how many. I said 1. She said you can sit at the counter. I told her I don't like sitting at counters.  She then said that then I would have to wait for a while. I asked how long and she said as long as it takes. Since I have to be back in Mesa by 5, I sat at the counter, as I watched her sit IMMEDIATELY two separate couples after me. I confronted her and she said, I told u I didn't know how long. I got up and left. I don't need to spend my money in an establishment that is unfriendly and has no morals. A lie came out of her mouth as easy as it is to walk"}
{"text":"I would give this place zero stars if I could. To begin with, service sucked. The waitress that took our order looked like she hated working here and was not even wearing a name tag. During our meal, we had to call her over 3 times because she did not bother to offer us any sauces or syrup (since my friend ordered the french toast).  The food was mediocre. I ordered the chicken strips dinner with fries and coleslaw and I have to say, the chicken strips from Dennys are 10x better. The coleslaw tasted old, the chicken strips were dry, and the fries were just okay. Since I did not enjoy my food, I sent it back and the waitress just said \"oh,\" left the check in our table, and left. We were waiting for her to come back for about 10 min to talk about the meal, but she never came back. We had to literally get up and look for her. We asked to talk to the manager because we wanted the meal taken off the check, but we were told that the manager was not there. We told the waitress we were not going to pay for a meal I had not ate and that we wanted it off the check. She hesitated and gave us a dirty look, but ended up taking the meal off the check.  Never coming back to this place again."}
{"text":"I've only been here during off-hours, so it's always been immediate seating and quick service. I love that you can get a fresh-tasting pot of coffee literally any time of the day. Their french toast is my favorite. It has seasoning (nutmeg? vanilla?) with in the bread or the egg which tastes SO GOOD. Service is attentive but not hovering, which is great. The ambiance is kind of kitschy, like diners used to be. For some reason it just rounds out the whole experience. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Saw a few of these places while we were in Vegas. It had good reviews so we decided to stop as we were driving out of town. Holy crap it was good. I ordered the Irish Eggs Benedict and even though 1 of the eggs was over cooked I still happily ate it. I told the manager just so it was brought to their attention. He offered me a remake, free food, ect. I told him I didn't want that. It was so good as it was. They were really busy and we were still seated right away. Some busy restaurants you can tell they have a hard time. This was such a well oiled machine. You gotta go"}
{"text":"Every single time I go I eat Breakfast here. I even Told the Germans about it. Wow this place one a Saturday is worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Great comfort food, reasonably priced with amazing service! What more could you want?"}
{"text":"Breakfast within a breakfast within a breakfast  If fashion designers had a breakfast collection their entire collection would be listed here. Packed with a hefty amount of comfort dishes & breakfast selections which makes denny's menu look like a single sheet of paper.  But that's not what this review is about. Its about their service! Stumbled here after yelping for a hangover cure, thanks to a fellow yelpers review this was the perfect place to crash after a long night of...(let's just leave it at that)  Prairie oyster the most disgusting cure for a hangover & after briefly explaining the ingredients to my host, my order came in promptly! In it came & down it went. Snapped up the bonanza skillet (with ham, hash browns) rejuvenating the gut.  As for service, no odd stares from the hosts just a patient & thoughtful waitress. Left her a good tip."}
{"text":"Good food delicious breakfast also delicious lunch the burgers are awesome the chili cheese fries and the pie are incredible! I really suggest if you're around the area stop here"}
{"text":"This is always a favorite when in Vegas . The chicken fried steak is awesome! Really all the food is awesome!! The breakfast meatloaf looked really good as well. Good for breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"The service at this place is awful but the food is good. It's hard to keep going back to this place.  You walk in and the blonde owner or whoever she is just stands there and stares at you instead of seating you. The wait staff is slow and doesn't check on you during your meal. Then it's time to leave and you stand there while the blonde owner stands around chatting about how someone came to visit the restaurant today instead of ringing you up so you can carry on with your day. Good food, bad service. I guess whether you go or not depends on your tolerance for customer service."}
{"text":"Wow that's what I call breakfast! Amazing food  and our server raven was very helpful.  I had the chicken fried steak and eggs with the buttermilk pancakes. The first time I can remember not being able to eat everything and believe me I wanted to!  Everything was outstanding good portions and great taste. I would recommend it to everyone who comes to Vegas."}
{"text":"The 4 stars is for the excellent service I received. Super friendly waitstaff. Food is ok nothing to write home about. I ordered the little boy blue without whipped cream. Blueberry pancakes would be better if they didn't top it with the weird blue goop. I guessing it's blueberry syrup. Once it arrived I regretted my decision. I would have preferred just blueberries. Eggs and bacon were tasty but then again it's hard to mess up eggs and bacon. Overall a positive experience."}
{"text":"Wow!!! Great food.  Great selection. Great waiter. It was hard to decide what to order but we elected to go with breakfast and the hash browns and bacon were cooked to perfection. I would go back there in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Good homemade muffins, you are pretty much safe whatever you order there, and the prices are good too. Good service, they are nice and fast. Right down the strip. They are also open early."}
{"text":"With almost 200 reviews written on this place, I feel writing a review for this place is like \"pissing into the wind.\"  Let's make it short and to the point.  This isn't a bad place for lunch or dinner. They have some unique menu ideas, and they give you portions that won't leave you hungry when you're done. One of my favorites is their Meat Loaf Sandwich.  Sounds dull, but it's a great alternative to Hamburgers.  Steer clear of the Mexican food. Though the cooks are hispanic, the Mexican food makes Taco Bell seem like an adventure in exotic eating.   I stopped going here because of their breakfast. I took my wife, Mother in Law, and Aunt here thinking they would be impressed with their breakfast.  It was the biggest disappointment ever.   The quality was sub par. You are better off going to the Omlet House, Egg Works, or the Original Pancake House.   Though the servers are personable, the cooks in the Kitchen have a bad attitude. Potatoes served with the meals were cold, and all of our different  choices were disappointing.  Bottom line. If you're a stoner and it's late, this is a good choice for a dinner like meal.   When it comes to breakfast, go somewhere that specializes in Breakfast, as listed above."}
{"text":"Love this place. The waffles are AMAZING!!!! I am very picky. Our omlett was good too. Will be returning as usual."}
{"text":"I love diners such as these, and they are a dying breed, even more in CA.  So, when I am in Vegas I will always stop by to get a piece a cake.  They are made fresh everyday, homemade, quality, and yummy!  I even take some cake home with me to Los Angeles for my Mom (carrot cake) because I can't find anything as good in our town."}
{"text":"This is a great family restaurant. It does look a lot like an old Denny's, but the food is far better in quality. They serve breakfast all day and i tried the fried chicken and waffles. So good. The waffle was thick and sprinkled with sugar and cinnamon. The fried chicken had a thin breading and very flavorful. Together they were the perfect cure for my new year's hangover. It's a nice place for some good quality food and appropriately priced."}
{"text":"Best French toast ever!  I was pleasantly surprised this place was so good :). My daughter and I came for breakfast and breakfast is what we had.  I also had eggs and hash browns ... Also very good.  The coffee was good as well.   I may have to come back for another breakfast during my stay here."}
{"text":"Place was really good. They use real honey on the coconut chicken. Staff is nice and have fun. Only thing I didn't like was it smelled like old mop water. But food made up for it. It's more like a locals place than the huge casino buffets."}
{"text":"I had an excellent cup of coffee, eggs, and a bowl of fresh fruit. The fruit was delicious! When they say \"fresh,\" they mean it! After spending a week on the strip and eating and drinking more junk then I could handle, this joint was just what I needed. The prices were still too high for your typical breakfast food. For two eggs, a bowl of fruit, and coffee, my meal was over $10. I guess we were just not far enough away from the strip to have real diner prices."}
{"text":"This place is great if you're obsessed with getting fat and drunk, however, if you're health conscious, looking for a varied menu with great quality, you're outta luck.  This place smashes Denny's and IHOP forsure, it's just a bummer that the menu is a typical American, SUPER PORTIONS and SUPER fried, greasy, fatty foods.  There are much better places to eat with better prices and choices.  I usually frequent this place to get drunk somewhere that's not a bar or casino.  The service here is pretty sucky.  Not a single time coming here have I not had to wait JUST for a menu or water.  After ordering there were multiple times the order just didn't come out and was forgotten.  So what's the point trying to give you any of my money xD?  Whatever it is, there isn't enough excuses to have multiple visits botched by multiple reasons that shouldn't even have happened in the first place when it comes to service.  If mistakes are made many businesses will comp a dish or give you something on the house or whatever.  Nah not here, it's the customers fault xD  Just avoid coming here.  Only really old people who don't care about their health or dollars come here cuz it's a nostalgia bomb of that diner with that heavy breakfast feel to it."}
{"text":"The great part about this restaurant was the variety but the chilaquilles were a pleasant surprise. The sauce was very flavorful. I would definitely recommend Blueberry Hill for breakfast."}
{"text":"I usually go to this place for breakfast. In the past months they changed chef and manager. The food changed completely into nasty and not tasteful. Service changed a lot. Horrible. Do not spend your money in this place. Last time I complaint about the food to the waitress that called the manager. He humiliated us with rude comments plus he cannot speak English. We saw him screaming at the waitress in front of everyone which made us feel uncomfortable. Health department should visit this restaurant because we saw lots of violations like chefs not using hair restraints, dirty floor, presence of pests, employees touching food that are ready to eat with their bare hands, etc.. I can see someone getting sick from food contamination easily here.."}
{"text":"No way was I getting caught in Denny's jail again, so I whipped out the Yelp app and typed in \"breakfast\" and this joint popped up. The general consensus seemed to be that this chain was a Vegas institution worth eating at at least once. Actually, based on most reviews it sounds like people don't recommend doing so more than once. I was in dire need of some foodstuffs, and the lure of a mountain of blueberry pancakes sold me quickly.   From the outside, it looks like a beat-down, antiquated Denny's wannabe; it doesn't look much different inside, either. We got a seat immediately and soon enjoyed the waitressing service of the sweetest old woman I've met since my grandma. Unfortunately, we got seated within earshot of a woman with the most annoying laugh I've ever heard on this planet in 29 years. It sounded like a hyena in the throes of lust with a frightened chimp. We looked lost in the gargantuan menu, so she made a few suggestions based on what we wanted. I went with 2 blueberry pancakes, 2 scrambled eggs and 3 strips of bacon. I really wanted the banana pancakes, but they couldn't be ordered in a combo. Crapola.   The food came up fast & hot - but the quality greatly varied. My blueberry pancakes were divine. The cakes were pillowy and moist, drenched with a blue viscous syrup and liberally peppered with fresh blueberries. No syrup required here - these cakes need to be eaten au natural. My eggs were.... eh, gross. I wish they weren't, but they were. I don't think they'd been properly cooked, so they were a little on the \"runny snot\" side in terms of consistency, and they tasted funky. The bacon was neither super crispy nor soft & chewy; it was just kinda there. There for me to eat. So I ate it. Luckily, the pancakes were so large that I was able to start on them, take a break to eat everything else, then go back to finish them off and to get the taste of the eggs out of my mouth.   If I were to come back here again, I think I'd only order something pancake related. Being a protein hound, this isn't my ideal breakfast, but their pancakes are really friggin' good. I'll probably return one more time to get the banana cakes, but that'll likely be the end of my relationship with Blueberry Hill. The rest of their food is decidedly mediocre, but the pancakes are mouth watering and the service was exquisite."}
{"text":"Great as usual.  A bit loud but we love the pancakes and the family friendly place."}
{"text":"Always make this a home away from home stop for breakfast. We love it here and the kids love it also ."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited about this place, since I saw it mentioned multiple times in the \"best breakfast in Vegas\" thread. I figured if it was referenced more than once this place must be the real deal!  I was pretty unimpressed. My girlfriend and I usually have breakfast once a weekend, and we have been rotating around new places every week, and so far I think Babystacks was our favorite place.  Don't get me wrong, my girlfriend got the white chocolate chip pancakes here and they were GREAT! I really liked those. However, I ordered the breakfast burrito and it was pretty... Meh. The country potatoes were alright, not great. The burrito itself had ok flavor, but being that it was pretty big and literally coated it sauce, I had to eat it with fork and knife. I was just really not psyched about it. I wish I had ordered something else.   One of the off putting things for me was the menu. As another review mentioned, he thought Cheesecake Factory was bad, but wow this place has too big of a menu. I hate when restaurants throw every possible option in the world at you. It makes it very difficult to make decisions, it puts more stress on the kitchen, and instead of deciding between a handful of great options like Babystacks, I was choosing between Mexican style breakfast or not haha it was overwhelming. I prefer a restaurant to put out what it does best. Keeps it simple, keeps the food good.   The prices also were good but not great. If it was cheaper I would have been less upset with my meal. My girlfriends pancake special though was a good deal, 7.99 for pancakes and sausage and eggs. Wish I had done that!   Overall just not very impressed. Maybe will be back, but only if I get tired of other places."}
{"text":"Wanted to escape the strip so we came in here for breakfast before hitting the road. Basing my decision on the delicious looking pictures on yelp, I was expecting this place to be good. The hash browns were cooked incredibly unevenly as some parts were not cooked all the way through. The cheddar in the cheddar-spinach omelette I ordered was so stringy and felt like plastic in my throat. The pancakes were the worst. They didn't have that same buttermilky goodness like a pancake is supposed to have and was falling apart! You can't even pick it up with a fork. When our server handed us the syrup, the bottle was already sticky and dripping all over the table. One of our spoons were dirty. The service did not compensate. Our server, a lady who wore her platinum blonde hair in a pony tail, came off a little harsh. I asked her if it was possible to get both the omelette and the hash browns in one order and she just told me to read the menu instead of pointing out a suggestion. The dishes I was looking at included pancakes, which I said I didn't want. She replies on this sassy voice, \"You won't get pancakes.\" Ok, cool. I didn't want them anyway. Instead of encouraging us to buy more, she warned each one of us that we wouldn't be able to finish the food. Guess what? At the end, though the food wasn't good, the plates were licked clean. We showed her!"}
{"text":"This is a fabulous place. We are so happy we discovered it while driving around Vegas.  Wonderful breakfast. Nicole was an excellent server.  We have eaten here many times and never disappointed."}
{"text":"I have been to several Blueberry Hill locations,but this was by far my best experience. The service and the food were fantastic. I was in the mood for pancakes but I was sure what kind. My server,Rebecca, recommended the blueberry pancakes. They were delicious!! Rebecca was very friendly and smiley!! Great server!!"}
{"text":"A co-worker recommended this place when my boyfriend and I traveled to Las Vegas.  We were staying downtown, and heard they had 3 locations, and this one seemed the closest to us. After we checked out of our hotel, we mapped this restaurant, and it was still about 10-15 away from Freemont street (with all the lights).  But, it was worth it!  At first glance, it looks like a throw back to the old fashioned diners.   I think the waitress we had, her name was Stella.  But, she reminded me of \"Flo\" from \"Alice\".  She called everyone \"darling\" or \"young man\".  She was very attentive and always was quick to refill coffee, which we needed! LOL.  Neither one of us ordered pancakes, ironically.  He had a skillet breakfast, and I had Chicken Fried Chicken...both were very good!   Wish would go back for lunch or dinner, as their menu was HUGE!  Well, save it for next time in Vegas...we will be back!  :)"}
{"text":"Everytime  we in Vegas this place is a must. Food is great service is great. Natalie waited on us of course she was great Cause we have the same name. We always do Breakfast when we come to Vegas but they also have lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Went here after hearing such good things & how this place is a \"Vegas staple\". Well, whatever you do, don't!  Our server was HORRIBLE! She was so ridiculously slow & NEVER came to check on us unless we flagged her down. Which I had to do often because their cups are so tiny, you take 2 sips & your drink was gone.  The food was sub-par. I ordered the Irish Benny - all was good except the English muffin was so soggy I didn't even want to eat it.  As for ambience, looks, & cleanliness? Well, I give it a 4/10. As an example, I sat on the booth & the thing was broken so it flipped up & almost knocked me to the floor (I am a VERY thin person, so fat jokes don't apply here).   Not a place I will be going again."}
{"text":"Great breakfast foods, big portions, friendly and quick service. A bit loud and very busy in the mornings, but so worth it!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Went in today after not. Ring here for some time and the manager still remembered us. Service is great and they have a great selection on the menu. Gotta remember this place for more frequent breakfast.   Here's an update. Came in today and wasn't a table available. Manager made sure we were seated immediately. Thanks again. You guys are the best!!"}
{"text":"4 Stars  Came in around 1am, so it was pretty empty. It probably gets more packed after the clubs get out. Service was slow....it took us at least 5 minutes for anyone to come to our table w/ menus, but when our server finally got to us, the service was great.  The Mexican Skillet (w/ Tortillas) and a side of Sour Cream and the Biscuits n Gravy were both really good (4 stars) --- that's a semi-sober rating, they'd probably be 5 stars if I was wasted.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-WLrZPzjKfrftLWaCi1QZQ?select=M6TtzjK6TzXOSKHINkYahA http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-WLrZPzjKfrftLWaCi1QZQ?select=KlSc2Suf1tkFqlf1DJNr_g http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-WLrZPzjKfrftLWaCi1QZQ?select=DOHjFnbPkKKjx_3CYYgNlQ"}
{"text":"Banana pancakes are great.  Sometimes they put sliced bananas in the batter and other times they only place them on top of cooked pancakes.  It tastes so much better when the bananas are mixed in!  Coffee was strong and hot. Have also had their corned beef hash, which was on par with diner cbh. Service was attentive."}
{"text":"We come here quite often, very impeccable service by our server, Sally. We always look forward to visiting. Food is always fresh and they are very quick! Definitely recommended:) Thank you Sally"}
{"text":"Visiting vegas saw this suggested on yelp. Big portions, great flavors, friendly staff, and at good prices."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! So good we ate their two days in a row. They have a mad  genius working in the kitchen putting together amazing combinations for breakfast! Don't lat they name fool you they offer so much more than just pancakes. Some examples Dixie meatloaf and eggs breakfast.( breaded meatloaf with beacon smothered in gravy served with potatoes and eggs) Gut buster breakfast( angus chopped sirloin topped with beacon covered in cheese aside served with potatoes and eggs). The menu is huge and has something for everyone. The staff is great and the service is quick. Loved this place every guy will love this place. We will be back."}
{"text":"love this place.. been to 2 of their locations.. great service! huge menu! great food!! come here every time im in vegas! love their blueberry pancakes of course.. huge steamy stack of blueberry deliciousness!! their coffee is great too!! also.. they are not only a breakfast spot! they are open 24 hours!! their prices are cheap for the portions! and they have daily specials which are a steal! love love love this place!"}
{"text":"A must stop when in Vegas. This place never disappoints! Great customer service.  The food is fresh and may like a home cooked meal."}
{"text":"I had the ham n bacon omelet with pancakes. The pancakes were fluffy and delicious. The food and service were great!! I will be back when I visit Vegas again!!"}
{"text":"I wish I had stopped at the IHOP around the corner which has now been downgraded to the SECOND most disgusting place to eat breakfast food. It has the same overused, undercleaned feeling of IHOP but without the swing-and-a-miss decor attempt.   The service was friendly, if not accurate nor timely.   The \"homemade\" blueberry muffin tasted as if it was a mixture of Krusteaz and cement. I ate two bites of that brick twelve hours ago and I've had the displeasure of constant \"reminders\" of its taste every few minutes since then.  I ordered The Alamo which was three small breakfast burritos that managed to rank below McDonald's similarly plasticine product in taste and texture. The beans that came with it were a brownish-gray paste that I have to admit I didn't have the courage to consume.  My friend ordered eggs and hash browns and was pleased. But then, she's not writing this review. This was, by far, the worst meal I have ever had in Vegas; and I've eaten the $3.99 steak and eggs special on Fremont Street.   I cannot recommend this place to anyone that is not completely 'faced before ever entering the building."}
{"text":"Our server was very friendly, and gave great recommendations. All the food was tasty as well."}
{"text":"Once again I had the potato pancakes. Yea they we're amazing again. I suggest that everyone try this dish. It comes with sour cream and applesauce. You can also get it with eggs for additional cost. They were very busy but the staff and Linda were making sure everyone was happy and taken care of."}
{"text":"What horrible service!  On 07/10/15 was my first anniversary. My husband and I went to eat some brunch at Blueberry Hill close to Charleston and Decatur in Las Vegas and we got some of the worst service ever. The server comes up and asks what we want to drink. My husband ordered a coffee; I ordered a coffee and water. The server started to walk away right as my husband asked to have a water added to his order as well. She looked irritated when my husband added a water to his order. Then, it took the server about 10 minutes to return to us to take our order. When we finally got our food, about 30 minutes after walking in, she told my husband that the toast may be a little burnt and to let her know if he wanted her to remake it. On the outside, the toast looked fine, so he kept it. The server then stated, \"okay, just remember that I'm here for you\", winked at us, then left and didn't check on us again. So when my husband lifted the bread, surprise, it was indeed burnt. He toughed-it-out and ate it because we had already decided not leave the server a tip. However, the bus person, named Felipe, was awesome. He actually kept our coffees full and brought us straws for our water; because the server didn't even give us that. My husband gave Felipe a tip in his hand, then we paid the bill, then we left. I asked Humberto Galindo if the server's perception of us \"minorities\" would've changed at all if she knew I'm a 14-year Air Force. However, that's neither here nor there...nobody deserves to be treated like we did. Recommendations: (1) TREAT OTHERS the way you want to be TREATED and (2) DO NOT go to the BLUEBERRY HILL near Charleston and Decatur in Las Vegas, NV."}
{"text":"Best breakfast! If you want a traditional home cooked feel and taste this is your place."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant at least 5 times since moving to Vegas. Love their food! From breakfast to dinner, each time we go, we enjoyed our meals. They have several restaurants in Vegas. Try anyone of them! Staff is friendly and always close by to refill your coffee."}
{"text":"Great place to go for breakfast near the strip. Try the little boy blue special if you want yummy blueberry pancakes. Service is above decent. Not the best but not bad at all."}
{"text":"Bomb bomb boooooooombbb breakfast :) the French toast was amazing. The pancakes were amazing the bacon was mouth watering. And they have Cholula hot sauce. Plus, our waiter was on point. He was great."}
{"text":"As any Vegas local will know and that this place has really great food. There is one bizarre policy however, and that is you can not make 'to go' orders for your children. My wife and I came into place an order to go and was informed that they DO NOT allow to go orders from the children's menu. I have eaten at restaurants all over the country and found this policy to be very strange. So, a family wants to come here and order food to go, but the kids have to eat adult plates? Also, you must give your credit number, expiration date, name, and zip code. Other than that, the food is always great."}
{"text":"Better than Denny's, IHOP, Carrows, whatever!  It's just simply good diner food - if you like diner food.    I usually stay away from eggs benedict at diners but I gave it a shot here and was pleasantly surprised at how good they were.  I will be back here again on my next visit to LV."}
{"text":"3 stars because when i walked in, everyone stared at me like they didn't know what i came for.  other than that, waitress was sweet & food was okay."}
{"text":"\"O-o-o-o-o-h I'm SSSSOOO FULL!\"  That's what you'll say after leaving this place; that's my first complaint.  It made a pig out of me.  The menu has so many choices that it is laminated and spiral bound.  There's a whole page just for Mexican breakfasts.    The color pictures make it hard to decide which meal to order; that's my second complaint.  My breakfast was delayed because it took me a while to tell the waitress which dish I wanted.  Butter cream waffles or french toast stuffed with cream cheese and topped with pineapple-coconut-rum?  Apple chicken sausage omelette or potato pancakes with sour cream?    And then there's the fine print; watch out for hidden extras!  I ordered a corned beef hash skillet and it came topped with potatoes and eggs over easy accompanied by a toast & jelly.  My husband's blueberry pancakes were huge and thick, with blueberries in & out, and topped with whipped cream and even he couldn't finish them.  Everything was delish.  Good variety of lunch & dinner items too, but you're out of luck if you're a vegetarian; even the salads all have meat or fish in them.  This place is extremely clean & bright, even the bathroom smelled good.  The waitress was extremely personable and attentive.  I'd eat here every day if I could."}
{"text":"Went back today and tried the Tennessee fried steak.  It's not battered as heavily as the CFS and the meat is not as tenderized like the CFS.  The meat was very tender.  I enjoyed it and recommend it.  The sour dough is purchased locally and its got a good flavor."}
{"text":"I wish I had a better experience here. I was expecting a lot more from the high four-star rating.  I'd rank Blueberry Hill under Denny's. That's right. It was that subpar. A friend and I came in around 1:30pm for breakfast for lunch. Half of the restaurant was being used and that half was pretty busy. Busy is a good sign, I guess.  It was quite a bit of a wait for our food. I noticed other parties who came in after we did receive their food first. When the food finally came, I was disappointed in the size and quality of the breakfast skillet. It was not very hot, and the potatoes were greasy. They skimped on sausage and peppers, and the scrambled eggs on top looked as if they had been shrunk dry. I've received much better skillets from Denny's, and theirs aren't great either. All the flavor came from the ketchup I added. The fruit crêpes were missing strawberry, but at this point we had waited so long we weren't going to complain. The cheese filling was good. Not sure if I'd return. I'd rather pay less elsewhere for better quality food."}
{"text":"Very good breakfast, not to far from the strip either. They had a wide variety on there menu and good service. Prices were very reasonable as well."}
{"text":"Always good food and service. I miss the old one out near Henderson that had a full bar and poker machines, but the food quality has always been consistent. I usually get an omelette from the menu and jazz it up a bit with some add ons"}
{"text":"The menu is huge with a lot of tasty items and our service and food was all good. The place looks a little run down and I overheard the staff complaining about their supervisor or manager that seemed to be on a power trip or something... But even though I could tell the employees were pissed off at someone, they were very attentive and polite with the customers."}
{"text":"Follow up form last night , had a good time here and enjoyed my meal ! I well return the next time I'm in Las Vegas ."}
{"text":"This is a great place for a good, cheap traditional American breakfast. Portions are good sized, service was good. Nothing fancy about this place, just an old-school diner. Everything was fresh, the hash browns were really good, corned beef hash was tasty and there was more than enough of it. It was less than 10 minutes from the time I was seated until my meal showed up.  Thank you Yelpers again for sending me off in the right direction again."}
{"text":"Food portions are huge and it was delicious. Service was slow and quite disorganized."}
{"text":"Having been to this restaurant several times in the past, I was disappointed to see a different approach to customer service. No one ever got our drink order. Just a man that came over to fill our coffees, which we never even ordered, and give us water. When we complained about my son's chocolate chip pancakes, which he ate only a few bites of, the plate was simply removed. No offer for other item, or anything. When the complaint was given to the cashier, her reply was,\"Uh! That is the first time we have ever had a complaint about our pancakes!\" . End of story. So sad what this place has become!! We will not be returning! They are rude!!"}
{"text":"They have such a wide range selection.  I wanted pancakes and really glad we went here. Their pancakes were so fluffy, large and delicious, I had to get a to-go box.  I can't wait to go back and try other menu items.  Service was attentive."}
{"text":"famous for their 24 hour specials. this family diner offers decent breakfasts all made from scratch. prices are reasonable. very busy on sundays there may be a wait. service is a little slow but friendly. lots of booth seating. i'd stay away from the dinner menu-not so good from experience. good breakfast"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came here for lunch before we had to go to work one day.  The service was absolutely horrible.  I was never offered a drink but was brought two glasses of tap water with no straws.  When the server, who acted like a monotone robot, did finally come around she asked my girl for her order then just stared at me!   Oook, whatever.  The Mexican omelette and club sandwich took over 25 minutes to get to the table.  Really?!!!   I get they were a little busy but come back and tell us it will be out soon.  The food finally came and it had no flavor whatsoever.  How do you F up a turkey sandwich!  We had to get to go boxes since it took forever and we had to leave.  She brought our check with the boxes and the check had food all over it.   By this time we were both irritated and wanted to leave but that took forever from the two cashiers that don't know how to work the register.   It's a damn credit card, swipe the crap and let's go!   Needless to say, we will never ever come back to this place, it was kind of busy but at least have upbeat staff who act like they appreciate your business and cooks that can put turkey and bacon on bread, not burn the shit out of it!   I'm never ever one to complain but this was ridiculous!"}
{"text":"I came to this place a few times but today was a little bit of a disappointment. I got a steak (cannot remember the name) and asked for it medium well. The steak I received was well done. It wasn't bad, but not what I asked for. The water tasted like tap water. The sour dough toast on the other hand was very good. The hash browns is what made me take off one of the stars. It was overcooked. It had a chip texture almost. I couldn't finish the hash browns and I usually love hash browns.   Service was great! Our server was very kind and gave us time to think about our order. The cashier lady up at the front is also very kind! She always has a smile on her face and it was nice to see that."}
{"text":"Their menu offers a variety of flavors from around the world. Their fresh blueberries taste as if they are out of this world. Their prices are above average for a diner setting. However they offer discounted meals on certain meals at certain times. Their diversified selection is not just limited to their food choices. Blueberry Hill is a place you will meet people from all over the world. Just take a moment to look around the restaurant at any given time. My advice is to something new. And while your at it, do not limit yourself from meeting new acquaintances.  Some of those experiences just night end up to be out of this world."}
{"text":"5 stars to alee..! Shes just hot and funny as hell..!cookies and cream fudge to finish this and  i just dont even remember what I ordered. I will be back."}
{"text":"We come here about twice a year when we're in Vegas. It feels like an IHOP but has better food. Service is pretty good too. Faves are French toast, butter cream waffles, pancakes and their yummy blueberry muffins. We always get some to go. The chicken n waffles was good the first time I had it but now the chicken is too salty. Overall a good breakfast place but not inexpensive. We will return"}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a LV local and I'm glad we came here.  It's a wonderfully outdated diner style breakfast spot that serves greasy, delicious food at a low price.  I got an omelet with ham, onions, and tomatoes.  It was amazing and a great start to a long day of Vegas sightseeing."}
{"text":"Service was prompt and pleasant.  Food selection is amazing!  Took us a while to choose what we wanted.  Food was plentiful and very good.  Great choice for our brunch!"}
{"text":"Blueberry Hill is a chain similar to IHOP. Seems there are lots of them in Las Vegas. Typical photo driven menu with lots of BIG portions. The pancakes were outrageously large! We had 3 chocolate chip pancakes at our table with whipped cream and our friend could barely eat one of them. The omelette was the size of a catcher's mitt. Very good. I had crepes with fresh blueberries, apple slices and strawberries. No artificial crap. Just the real deal. There was so much food we skipped the toast!   Worth a try when you find a Blueberry Hill in your travels!"}
{"text":"I had been wanting to go have breakfast here for the longest and my boyfriend finally took me there and OH EMM GEE the pancakes were good. The service was great and I will definitely go back gotta give the hash browns a thumbs up too"}
{"text":"Our breakfast experience delightful & delicious. Our server Martha was friendly and very attentive. Prices are great and they have so many dining options. We will definitely be back soon! Martha thank you for making outer experience fantastic!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Four stars for the excellent pancakes. Ti seems to simple to do but so few restaurants do pancakes as well as Blueberry Hill. The bacon and scrambled eggs were pretty average.  Service was good."}
{"text":"If they had better bacon, I'd give them four stars. As it is right now, it's just too routine of a . I restaurant. I got a simple meal for breakfast, the waitress special. The waffle was good. The scrambled eggs were scrambled eggs. The bacon tasted like they had cooked it several hours earlier and then reheated it. I might have liked the meal better if I had gotten the chicken and waffles. This was just too much like Sysco food. I would eat here again but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, so only three stars."}
{"text":"Service was a bit slow today and they ran out of the French vanilla creamer,  But my French Toast was right on.  The food is still worth the wait here."}
{"text":"The food was good, our waitress was sweet and very attentive. The kids seemed to enjoy what they ordered since they finished mostly everything on their plates but you really have to come here on an empty stomach because the portions are big. It definitely beats waiting for a table at the Peppermill or paying for an expensive buffet."}
{"text":"Good pancakes! Reasonably priced food. Friendly staff. Susie was a doll. However this place needs to up their sanitary practices. All of my silverware was dirty. The table was sticky and my friend saw a cockroach, not exactly the most inspiring when you're preparing to eat."}
{"text":"The place was busy, but not packed. It was a Saturday around 10 AM so it was nice to be able to get seated right away. The service wAs fast  and efficient. The menus was large and has something for everyone. My son had the French toast combo with hash browns and eggs. He devoured it and said it was delicious. My husband had a biscuits and gravy 1/2/3 that came with eggs and sausage. His plate was CLEAN! He loved every morsel. I opted for a patty melt with Curley fries. My only complaint is that I didn't get enough fries. The sandwich was delicious and the fries were as well. We were in town from AZ  and will keep this place in mind when we return."}
{"text":"Amazing staff. Beautiful ambiance. And the food...man, I needed a good long nap afterwards. I think it took me two days to finish a meal. The price was great. And I'm in love with the vibe. It's almost like having a meal at grandmas. My coffee kept getting topped off (thank heavens cause that's my style) definitely a place I'll be coming back to."}
{"text":"open 24hrs 7days a week.  when you walk in its like your walking into the 70's, but its really nice.  service is great, food is great.  i would always order Blueberry pancakes or Blueberry waffles.  maybe because of the name of the place.  but anyways, good stuff.  you will definitely leave there stuffed."}
{"text":"Do not order the chorizo!!! it was too spicy & mushy!blah!"}
{"text":"Great portions for the price. This was our last stop before heading back home. It reminded me of a Denny's with a little more old school touch. The food was fresh and delicious plus the staff was great. I believe it is a family run business so they are very consistent with making sure you are feeling at home. I ordered a platter with sausage, eggs, pancakes, and hashbrowns. I did some substitutions since I am not a fan of bacon and got all sausage instead. I had a total of 6 sausages which might have been a little too much for my stomach to handle. Overall, I would visit here again for a hearty breakfast meal."}
{"text":"Quick and inexpensive. I actually went and visited because of the Yelp reviews. They have a rather large and extensive menu of breakfast items. Though I'm not a fan of pancakes, they looked DELICIOUS and I would definitely recommend going here and trying them if you are a pancake fan. I wanted to eat somewhere off the strip and not in a casino so this was a perfect place. It was pretty crowded but we got seated pretty quickly."}
{"text":"AMAZING.  Tons of food choices and so good.  I hear it gets crowded but we were there a little after 7am and there was only a few people in there.  I ordered scrambled eggs, bacon and pancakes.  I forget which item specifically it was called.  E ordered an egg white omelette with spinach and sausage and the wheat pancakes with granola and nuts.  OMG so delicious.   Our waitress was super nice and attentive.   We will definitely return. (beware, the parking seems to be a little limited so if it is crowded, I can only imagine the congestion and chaos)"}
{"text":"Experience:  my friend and I were a little hungover and looking for a spot to grab some breakfast.  She likes this place, so we stopped in.   Food:  The food was pretty decent.  We got curly fries to start and the order was so big, it filled me right up.  Then my main meal came, but I was too full and got a Togo box...not before I got a few bites in to taste it hot. I ordered the pork chop breakfast. Eggs were cooked perfectly and pork chops were crunchy on the outside and juicy in the middle. Hash browns were ok. They were like fried potato peelings.    Service:  the waitress was ok....she wasn't rude, but not friendly either.  But the manager needs to take a few lessons in customer service. When we left to pay, I approached the counter and the manager and cashier were changing the drawer. Neither one of them acknowledged us standing there. Didn't even look in my direction. I understand being busy counting, but while one was counting, the other could say...we'll be with you in a minute or something. After about 10 minutes of waiting, they finished, and there was no apology for the wait, or thanking for my patience, just her taking my check and saying hello, as if I just walked up.  Anyway, I was not impressed.   Facility: it's ok. Not a dive, but it's an older restaurant and it shows.   Overall review:  I would come back, because the food is good, but definitely not for the service. Hope the manager reads this!!!"}
{"text":"Experience:  Taking out my Grandfather for dinner, I have to pick somewhere with traditional American or Italian good not too far from his home. This showed up on YELP. I've been to other Blueberry Hills, but this is my first time in this location. It was 5:30 on a Wednesday.   Facility:  Just like the other BHs, it is a typical American diner decor and feel. There are all booths for seating. It was a clean spot with very few patrons. They play 50s kinda music quietly overhead.   Service:  We were told to seat ourselves. The waitress was nice enough, but seemed to be the only one working, so pretty busy.   Food:  I ordered the pork chop dinner with country gravy on the side.  The pork chops 3.5/5 were cooked pretty good. Just a tad on the dry side, but not enough to ruin the food.  Mashed potatoes were homemade, and yummy!!! 5/5 Country gravy was good too. 4/5 Green beans were green beans 3/5, but they did have a little flavor to them to make them more savory.   Overall:  I liked this spot. The food was good. Grandpa was happy, and it was a nice and close to him. We will DEFINITELY be back. :)"}
{"text":"Best eggs benedict florentine I've ever eaten in my life. And i've had a lot of eggs benedict in all kinds of different ways. The hollandaise sauce was thick and creamy. Mmmmm and the eggs benedict was served with mushrooms which really enhanced it. The french toast was addicting. The BOMB!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, great home town feel restaurant. All my favorite breakfast foods, large portions, not oily or greasy either. Off the strip but not too far. Prices are great for the meal you're getting as well. My favorite meal is the omelet and hash browns, though I've never tasted anything bad out of this restaurant!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars  This is where big ass families or hungover twenty-somethings go on Sunday mornings to binge on pancakes and syrup; I was part of the latter. Perhaps the alcohol clouded my judgement but it wasn't too bad. The portions are generous and prices are reasonable. They focus on classic American food with some south of the border influence. Chorizo Omelette and Chilaqueles Verde, anyone? There are no frills, glitter, and gimmicks here. Just straight forward food.  I enjoyed my veggie omelette and pancakes. It tasted fresh and not too greasy. My friend gave her stamp of approval on the Huevos Rancheros. Although, they were late on giving my friend's potatoes. Ambiance recalls old Vegas diner: fading lights, plastic seats, and outdated decor. This places screams nostalgia. The waitress was totally cool and seemed unfazed by the stampede of customers. Overall, Blueberry succeeds on delivering decent breakfast food."}
{"text":"Great service, great food, good prices! Highly recommended, you can feel the touch of a family business, bravo!"}
{"text":"Came in for the pancakes. Not disappointed. Three fluffy buttermilk pancakes that would melt in your mouth. Syrup wasn't overly sweet so I can honestly say that if you want pancakes, this is the place. The eggs and bacon however I was not impressed. Eggs were just fried and put on a plate. Not garnished or any extra seasoning at all. The bacon I did not like at all. Too greasy for my taste.  The service was great. Wait staff was friendly and attentive"}
{"text":"Chicken and waffles.  Wonder.  Malted waffle batter added surprising flavor to thin white meat juicy fried chicken on thick waffles.  Four pieces of chicken covering each of the quarters of waffles.  Strawberry compote (from crepes) went fabulously well with this ridiculous combination. I kept thinking these disparate mealtime pieces had no business being together.   I was so wrong.  The four cheese (cottage, cream, sour&?) crepes (two) filled the plate. Just the right amount of sweet to savory balance.  It came with choice of fruit compote. I chose strawberry on the side.  I like to taste the main part before dousing it with something all to sweet.  Good thing.  'Cause my Partner-in-Dine used it on her chicken and waffles.  She also ordered cheese fries (not on menu and not a problem).  We expected cheddar cheese but got American which, was just as good.  My crepes came with three eggs and my choice of crispy bacon.  Done right.  Everything from greeting upon entry to accommodating both of our particular preferences with a smile and speed.  No sense our server was hiding an eye roll.  She made us happy and made us believe she was happy to serve us.  We will be back.  And the next day we were.  To a different location this time.  My First PID had the Veal Parmigiana.  The veal was nearly 3/4 inch thick and the batter was thin and crispy.  Too often it is the reverse.  PID2 had to try the Chicken and Waffles.  He is picky about this kind of thing, too.  He finished them off.  I had eggs & bacon cooked exactly as I ordered (I am finicky about this, as many other things) and pancakes so light, fluffy, sweet, and HUGE.  I couldn't finish it all.  Unusual for me not to leave a clean plate.  But, I was so full there was just no way.  Service here was equally as good as at the other location.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Very good food!   I'm from GA, so I'll compare the quality/quantity to Waffle House, but the prices are a bit steeper than WaHO.  Good overall! Yummy desserts as well."}
{"text":"We come here every Sunday morning for breakfast. We went today for lunch because my husband was off work today. I have to say if you look around  the place is dirty! Windows and mirrors need to be cleaned. The walls are filthy, the table tops are stained, and I've noticed more often the seats aren't cleaned. Today there was wet syrup on my seat. The food is good, service is usually decent, the prices are not cheap , they need to clean the place up!"}
{"text":"i always come in late night for an omlett!! DELICIOUS.. also their cinnamon pancakes are bomb! but -1 star because they dont cut their lemons correctly.. and they have the best french fries in the world!!"}
{"text":"Best pancakes I've had at a restaurant. They are fully homemade and HUGE. I got the blueberry compote on top and they add lots of whipped cream. Enough for probably 4 people. Also got a side of hash browns which were better than average and the coffee was average. The service wasn't very fast but it was friendly. A little expensive, but if you have pancakes cravings try it out. There was a ton of other stuff on the menu that looked really good."}
{"text":"Whatever you order, make sure to get a side of pancakes. I make mine from scratch too at home, but they don't come out this fluffy. Had breakfast with my sister's family here before leaving town. I ordered the special with pancakes instead of toast. SO GOOD! I did make the mistake of taking a bite of my sister's french toast. By mistake I mean I almost pinched her under the table like when we were kids so that I could take an exta bite!  They do have awesome mac and cheese here, which is weird that I know that, but the neices were fighting over the last few bites. I took a stray roni - and mmmm cheesy goodness! I also asked for a little more iced tea when the check arrived. She brought it to me in a gigantic to-go cup so that i could have it on the drive back :) how nice is that?! and when I tripped on the curb(dork alert) clenched my cup too hard and poke a hole in the styrofoam from my GI Joe kung fu grip, she brought me another one.  to sum it up - yummy made from scratch goodness, superb service, and good prices!"}
{"text":"Great service and great food....didn't have to wait long to be seated nor did we have to wait long for our food and the portions were huge and our server Margarita was very attentive to us....."}
{"text":"Walking in here I had mixed reviews on the atmosphere & the overall environment. I really wanted some French Toast & didn't feel like yelping another place so I thought I'll give it a shot.   I had 3 different waiters, My coffee was empty for about 15 mins, and had an ignorant loud group next to me and the place was semi full... It took a while for my food to come but the French Toast was on point and that bacon reminded me of the old packaged corn king bacon that used to be my favorite, lol. The eggs were done right and hash browns were awesome. Only complaints is the ignorance of the guests I was seated next to and slow service."}
{"text":"Excellent quick service, great breakfast, attentive staff.  MUCH better atmosphere than a dingy depressing casino. Go here!"}
{"text":"My second visit, busy but service was good. My wife ordered three stack pancakes & I ordered omelette.  Must say pancake was outstanding, soft and fluffy somehow pancake stayed warm.  Much better than casino breakfast restaurants."}
{"text":"The service in this place was SO BAD we never actually met our official waitress. The person we flagged down was an elderly lady who kept apologizing about the section waitress.  The food, while not horrible was over sized to the point that made me uncomfortable leaving so much uneaten. This is the first place I have felt compelled not to leave a tip in 30 years.  Silver lining ....... ? ...... the cashier undercharged me by about $10.00  I'd AVOID THIS PLACE unless you're the type that could be used as an extra on an episode of \"Breaking Bad\""}
{"text":"We decided to venture off the strip for breakfast & found out about BH on Yelp, it did NOT disappoint. The menu is HUGE so it took awhile to settle on something. There were so many choices & they all sounded amazing. I got the chorizo breakfast skillet & it was delicious. The only thing I would change about it is maybe add guacamole. My husband had the biscuits & gravy & the biscuits melted in your mouth, so good! I was almost mad that I didn't get that. Our waitress was really sweet but it seemed like she had way too many tables. A couple of the tables by us were running her ragged so she didn't get to check on us as much but I used to waitress so I totally understand. My husband & I come to Vegas 2/3x a year & will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Everytime we come to Vegas, we come here at least once. The service is great and everything we've ever ordered has been amazing and left us barely able to walk back to the car. The boyfriend got potato pancakes this morning that nearly burnt his throat they were so fresh but he claims it was worth the pain. I got an omelette that never possibly could have been finished by a single person. Ok, maybe that's not true, but I surely would have felt like vomiting if I had eaten the whole thing. I also have fond memories of the blueberry pancakes and a pecan waffle of some sort. If I recall correctly, I think I really wanted to drink the syrup that came with the pecan waffle. Yes, it was that good. Leave the strip. Go drive way far away to blueberry hill because the time spent eating and the nap required after will kill enough time to keep you from losing all your money at the blackjack table."}
{"text":"Location - stand alone building. Lots of parking.   Place - Clean. Plenty of seating options.  Seated right away. Aside from myself there were just 4 other parties there. Was there for late, late breakfast at around 4pm.  Serve it all day.  LOTS of choices on menu. A bit overwhelming but appreciated.   Food - Hash skillet well cooked. VERY tasty!!  The homemade salsa looked bland but I was wrong... Great flavor.  Asked for biscuit which they split, buttered and grilled. Wow!! Was Amazing!  Served in skillet and placed in pasta bowl.  I had to slide the meal onto the bowl since I'm sensitive to metal and my bites were metallic.  Wussey  move, I know.  Waitress talked me into cheesecake.  Was good but a bit dry. Had plain and definitely could use a saucy topping.    Staff - My waitress was a Latina with accent. SUPER sweet, nice and accommodating.  On top of it for sure. She made it a point to say bye.    Overall - I'd definitely come back.  I'd pass on the cheesecake next time."}
{"text":"Pretty good little 24 hour diner."}
{"text":"This place is very Old Vegas in a good way. Staff is very attentive and the food is pretty good. Their pancakes are ADDICTING and so delicious. You have been warned."}
{"text":"Ever had a $100+ midnight snack/breakfast?  No, that is not how much we spent for our food here but that's about how much we've spent in total for our impromptu trip to vegas.  We left for Vegas around 9pm and got here around 1:30am. There were only a few cars in the parking lot. There are slot machines by the waiting area and past them is the specials board.   Order: Little Boy Blue - stack of 3 blueberry pancakes with blueberry topping and whipped cream, 2 eggs, and choice of ham, sausage, or bacon. Got the ham. - definitely YAY for the pancakes :)  Mushroom omelette (from the specials board) - came with hash browns  Coffee - Columbian brew  Service: sloooooooooooow! The server was trying to serve six tables at once. Then more people arrived that they actually opened up another section and then my water glass disappeared. Is that a cue to just keep asking for coffee?   We'll probably come back when we're in the area but probably get it to go. I noticed that the guy who walked in after us to get his order to go got his before we did."}
{"text":"This place is sooo good. Their coffee is delicious!! I've tried a few different things on the menu, but the French toast will always be my favorite!!  3 stars because the service can be super slow... I've seen people walk out on several occasions. But when they're on it-- blueberry hill is awesome."}
{"text":"Wonderful food try to chicken and waffles. Pancakes are delicious eggs cooked to perfection and service was outstanding"}
{"text":"The best chicken and waffles I've ever had.  Puts Roscoe's to shame!"}
{"text":"Great replacement for Village Inn, IHOP, or any other pancake type of diner.  The portions are huge and the price is reasonable.  The service is quick and the menu is full of options."}
{"text":"This restaurant is always great for a good breakfast in the morning, but if you decide to take advantage of their 24 hour service, be prepared for the slowest service on the planet.  The staff is always friendly but they are super slow at night.  The restaurant is \"ok\" when it comes to cleanliness, the best I can say is that they have the nicest smelling hand-soap ever.  The prices are reasonable but the quality is not quite worth the money.  As always, this will still end up one of my favorites because they are open 24 hours and I prefer them to IHOP and Denny's anyday."}
{"text":"I normally like this place but I came at 12am and the service sucked. One waitress and she was very unpleasant and she tells us that she will get to us when she can.  Well at 1230 when she didn't get to us we decided to leave.  When asked for her manager's number she said she didn't have that info and when asked for the store info she told us we can look it up.  We were asked if we wanted coffee and said yes we didn't even receive that."}
{"text":"I eat the coconut chicken and waffles love it! Last couple of times I ate the biscuits and gravy only problem I have I that I never finish it lol it's way too much food"}
{"text":"We always stop at the nearest location when we're in Vegas. Huge portions, fast nice service. Can't beat it really."}
{"text":"I had been here before, about eight years ago.  I went with my sister who couldn't really afford to go anywhere \"fancy.\"  We went and had a nice early dinner, at a reasonable price.  Fast forward eight years.  I'm working, making better money (still cheap, though!) and with my boyfriend, who loves, loves, loves waffles.  He was going to settle for Denny's, when I remembered Blueberry Hill.  We drove up and he was super skeptical about the place.  It isn't the most interesting looking diner around.  But, it is big and clean.  The place was bustling, but I think that it was a bunch of locals having a leisurely Sunday breakfast.    Jeff ordered a waffle combo with 2 poached eggs and 2 pieces of bacon.  Not having had enough fruit and/or fiber, he also ordered a side of fruit.  He devoured the waffle!  The eggs he wanted a little better cooked than they were, but he still ate them and didn't feel the need to send them back.  The bacon he took his time on eating.  The fruit also went slowly.  I had a few pieces of cantaloupe from it and I thought it was sweet, despite not being completely ripened yet.  I got a breakfast burrito. I didn't realize that it was smothered.  Had I known, I might have asked for them not to smother it.  It was a weird sauce, not quite enchilada sauce, not Spanish sauce, not marinara, not salsa, yet it had elements of all of them.  Very strange.  It added nothing to the dish.  The insides were scrambled eggs, peppers and oninons. I love onions, so I wouldn't complain about that, but others might think there were more onions than eggs.  I asked them to leave off the rice. They did and I just had salad, some sour cream and the refried beans with the burrito.  The beans were fine, probably canned, but they were hot and not too salty.  I was just ok with what i got.  I probably should have just gotten an omelet.  The cashier was painfully slow.  There was a line of about 7 people. We could have easily left without paying.  Jeff was honest, however.   They have a few video slots machines right when you walk in, but I never saw anyone play them.  The windows in that entryway also have a southwest theme etched into them, but the logo of the place is a boy pouring out blueberry jam?  It was a non sequitir for me, but since I didn't go there for the ambience, I can't really criticize it."}
{"text":"MMMM expecting greatness, however I was very surprised at the overall experience from this place. We came in here and there were alot of people waiting to sit down (20 min wait) which is usually a good sign. We waited almost exactly 20 min for our table. Our server was Jacelyn. She took our drink order and we were on our way into our Blueberry hill experience. My 5 year old was quick to point out how dirty her silverware was. They must have just missed this batch as there was some black and  brown left over crusted on her knife and fork. We gave Jacely our order as I ordered the strawberry pancakes because the picture on the menu looked fabulous. My girl got the meatlovers skillet, my daughters the strawberry french toast and happy face pancakes. The order took about 13 min to come to our table. That is when the fun began. We gave Jacely our entire order the first time around. She forgot about half of it. Missing eggs, toast, no whipped creame, no ketchup, no powdered sugar. I noticed i had only 3 pancakes when the picture clearly showed 4 and was smothered with strawberry sauce and whipped creame. Mine had non of this. Just a little dribble of sauce and a ice creame scoop of butter. I thought, well maybe they are busy, however this is supposed to be a top line breakfast joint. They should know that weekend business would be extreme so why the mess up. Anyway I ate about half my breakfast before our server came back with the whipped creame, forgot the everything else. Had to tell her again what was missed as she walked away paying attention to other people, no biggie. She returned with no hash browns and no sugar. my daughter wont touch her french toast without powered sugar and again had to ask Jacelyn for the rest of our order. I never got my hash browns and just figured she was real busy and forgot. That wasnt the kicker, the people next too me ordered the same strawberry pancake dish as mine and hers was entirely different. 1 more pancake, tons of strawberry dressing, whipped cream on top as i didnt have any at all as Jacelyn forgot our request. I asked the lady what she had ordered, same as mine, i thought WTF....Jacelyn never came back to check our drinks so at this point i am pretty irritated. Since my breakfast was not that good to begin with, I tried my daughters french toast. she said be careful daddy as there are hard things in my meal. I was like WTF again. I took a bite and instantly bit down on something hard as a rock. I spit it out and my daughters french toast had tons of uncooked rice in her meal. At this point I was like f this place. We got our check and i couldnt leave fast enough. The service was terrible. I thought if this supposed to be top notch breakfast place they must have missed the hiring procedure with Jocelyn as she squeaked by and has a job here. At hash house a go go i am sure she would be fired on the spot as they would not accept the type of service Jacelyn puts out. Didnt want to even deal with the drama of talking to a manager at this point, so my advice dont believe the hype. Find a secluded Dennys as you will get an overall better product than Blueberry Hill Restaurant. VERY DISSAPPOINTED."}
{"text":"Great service by my waitress Sally. She knew how to make the experience memorable. My meal was over the top the best meal in a real long time. Ham steak, eggs, potato chunks with country gravy OH!!! Let's not forget the biscuits and gravy. Never had that type of biscuits before. Best I ever had for sure. I will return next time I pass through. In the meantime I will tell all my friends.  Thank you Blueberry Hill and Sally for such a great experience."}
{"text":"It's nice to eat a big breakfast away from the casino and not have to pay through the nose for it!  I go here at least once every Vegas trip.  Glad to have found this place!"}
{"text":"Wife and I haven coming to this local diner for nearly 20 years.  The pancakes snd biscuits are homemade!!! Wife gets the Little Boy Blue (eggs sausage and a blueberry pancake)  I always get the homemade biscuits  The servers always remember us -- it feels like home.  Open 24 hours We always go to the 1595 E Flamingo location"}
{"text":"I just had the Denver omelet and it was huge! It was enough for two people, but I as a pig and ate the whole thing!"}
{"text":"From traditional breakfasts to home style meals this place is like an old diner. The food is always prepared fresh and served hot. Service is a bit slow when busy but worth the patience."}
{"text":"This place was all of it and then some!   We took a mini Vacay to Vegas and wanted to splurge on a yummy breakfast at an 'old school' spot.   I actually found this place on Yelp and looked at the pictures and my peeps and I agreed this place is what we needed :0)  The service is 10++ our server never got annoyed with our many requests(water refills , sugar free syrup ect) and we loved that on each table they had a tray full Of everything we needed like Ketchup, hot sauce, salt n pepper, Cream and many kinds of sweeteners.   The food was in ginormous portions and of course we have big eyes and had plenty of food left for breakfast then next day (I couldn't even eat my chocolate pancakes because my skillet filled me up!)  Everything was yummy the place was clean and services was perfect. Check out my pics and try this place you won't be disappointed !"}
{"text":"I recently visited Blueberry Hill when I was in Vegas. The food was phenomenal, I had an omelette and a side of biscuits and gravy! The portions are huge so order accordingly! The staff was very helpful and I also had great service! Next time I go back to Vegas I will definitely go back there!"}
{"text":"This was my third visit to this restaurant and it's been worse with each visit! The only reason I gave it 2 stars rather than 1 star is because the food tasted okay.  It was a little busy, but this was not a good visit! I'll just be brief rather than mentioning all of the annoyances of this visit.  I told her that my mother couldn't eat a whole waffle (she's 88) so I wanted to order a half of waffle.  I knew they sold 1/2 waffles as it was shown on the kids menu for $1.00, our waitress (server #10) said she couldn't sell us that and I said that's fine, but you must have 1/2 waffle she can get since she won't eat a whole one. I told her I wanted it with the fruit composite, an order of bacon and 1 egg. I had a crepe.  Our waitress brings us our two cups of coffee while waiting for the food, the coffee tasted like it had been sitting there for over an hour! I took one sip and moved it to the edge of the table, could not drink such a bad cup.  I told the waitress the coffee tasted really bad and ordered a glass of merlot instead. She took away the full cup of coffee and brought me the glass of merlot.  This may all sound petty, but a GOOD waitress would've worked a combo for elderly to make her meal affordable, and would've gladly removed my coffee from the bill since I didn't drink it due to it tasting bad.  When the bill came, I mistakenly gave her my card without reviewing it.  I received the copy of the bill which just showed the cost:  $43.58 before tip. She didn't even include a breakdown with my copy. I certainly don't think this was worth $43.58: 1/2 waffle with fruit composite 1 crepe with 3 fruit combo 1 side of bacon 1 egg 1 cup of coffee (as she should not have charged for 2) 1 glass of merlot My last visit here thanks to server #10 By the way I did leave a $5.42 tip but that was only because the cooks and other staff deserved something!"}
{"text":"Every time I've been to the HILL, I've tried something new.  Breakfast, lunch, and dinner - all served 24 hours a day.  The breakfasts are awesome, 10x's better than IHOP.  Huge portions, cheap prices, good food.  What more can you ask for?  Well, I'll tell you.  Service.  The staff at the HILL are great.  Even though the restaurant is huge - you get that truck stop, small diner feel.  The waitresses are friendly, quick to acknowledge you, and never let your cup get empty.    And the bonus?  Every half hour this bell goes off.  Its a reminder for the staff to wash their hands.  COOL!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has delicious breakfast food. I personally love the strawberry crepes. The ham is the size of the plate. The salsa is spicy and appears homemade. Forget Dennys and IHOP, they can't compete with Blueberry Hill Family Restaurant."}
{"text":"I have never had such poor service. What was suposed to be an early fathers day breakfast turned into a nearly 45 minute wait for our food, while other party's  were sat, ordered and served before we had received our order. After eating for a few minutes we finally decided to just leave. My wife took my youngest daughter  out to the car while I waited for a box and check. Had to ask twice for the box, and the other family, having requested box and check after me, received there box and check before I did. Sadly this isn't  even the first tine this has happened, not sure why I ever come back to this place."}
{"text":"Been here several times with my friends and family.  Traditional diner. 24 hours.  Their specials can be tricky at times, there are a couple locations, one was near the military base but it closed down The flamingo location has breakfast all day.  The servers are very fast and friendly  They have everything on the menu it's crazy  It's like Denny's but a little better"}
{"text":"Food comes out hot and fresh. The serving of pancakes with breakfast entree is humongous! Warm, fluffy and tasty! I'd come again.  Coffee's a little pricey, but other than that, it's good."}
{"text":"OMG!!!! This place is GREAT at 1am me and my husband had thee best server Tina and some bomb ass food. Definitely not your waffle house or ihop, we normally slam but we had food still to take home portions are BIG. We had a little bit of a wait for Our food but the food was fresh made to order. The server said you can't rush perfection and she was right."}
{"text":"Father's day brunch for family of 6 and service was great.   I guess we had arrive early enough to beat the crowd.    Awesome Sunday ! ! !"}
{"text":"Philly cheesesteak omelet. 4 xl eggs are you kidding me? This thing is huge. Fluffy. Steak is grilled perfectly. Bob got a veggy omelet and opted for the pancakes. Three pancakes the size of a plate 3/4\" inch thick each. Figd they can't be good. Boy a bad 2nd day to be low carb. He said they were excellent. So I tried one bite w one drop of syrup. Hands down the best pancake I have ever eaten. Fluffy, creamy, tender. Perfect."}
{"text":"I almost always come here when I come to Vegas, and normally I have a good time here. service tends to be quick and speedy with a smile. But this last time, OMG, I've seen molasses move faster than the server we got.  We were seated fairly quickly, which can be a plus, as this place usually has a wait. But it was all down hill from there. Our server took over 15 minutes to get to us before we could order our food. Yes, order. Then after that, it too even longer to get our food to our table. When the food did finally get there, well, it was cold. Yes, cold people.  I hope this is just a one time thing, but yeah...be careful if you get the \"sweet old lady\" as your server."}
{"text":"Wont be coming back to this location any time soon. Came here with the hubby and waited forever to get a soda & ice tea. We should have walked out..we saw the writing on the wall. Server didnt understand our order and we knew it was gonna be bad..but we still stayed! Ugh! They ran outta mashed potatoes..my hubs fav. So he got FF and they of course sucked. Seemed stale..looked stale. I had a mexi combo plate. It was ok..nothing great. But it took 50 minutes for a grilled cheese/FF and mexi plate and then she never brought bill. Hubs had to go up and get it to pay. Normally this place is ok..just ok. But not today."}
{"text":"Came here with the hubby & my kiddo today for lunch. I ordered the mexi combo plate so I could share with the little one. It came with a taco, burrito, quesadilla and rice/beans. It was fresh and filling but nothing to jump up about. Hubby had the grilled cheese & mashed potatoes. He loves that combo and was very happy with it even though it looked pretty lame to me. Our server was ok but we did get harassed as we were walking in by some homeless guy..get this..he told us to eat at Omelet House..LOL Weird."}
{"text":"This place is perfect for when you're passing through Vegas on a road trip from Colorado to California, as we did. Ordered take out, cheeseburger with curly fries, egg white veggie omelet which came with pancakes or hash browns...the serving sizes were HUGE! Husband loved the burger and fries. Omelet was hot and delicious. Great friendly staff."}
{"text":"The restaurant was clean but our server was not so friendly.  She rushed us to order, never smiled, and did not even thank us for coming in so she received a penny tip.  The food was okay.  I ordered breakfast but for the cost, I could went to Dennys and received the same or better meal for a much lower price."}
{"text":"Omg! This place was wonderful. Our waitress was sweet and talkative we us. Very very sweet. The food was amazing! I had french toast and my boyfriend had pancakes and it made my mouth water. When in Vegas again I am most definitely eating there again."}
{"text":"Came here because I had heard good reviews, customer service was alright. My food was not good at all. I ordered the steak and eggs for 15$, steak was horrible no seasoning or flavor to it.  Just an FYI so if you ever want to try that plate out."}
{"text":"Food. Was. Amazing.  I tried the Chicken & Waffles with an Apple Compote. It was great!  Bring your appetite!"}
{"text":"5 stars for Parmesan-crusted chicken with lemon sauce. Very fresh and tasty...home style cooking.   5 stars for Mexican style Chilaquiles with a home-made spicy red sauce     10 stars for the incredibly friendly and helpful waitress who made a great impression on our whole extended family. (-:  Thank you!!! Everyone was delighted.  5 stars for outstanding value. Lots of great meals at Blueberry Hill for under $10. This was fun and a great place for all of us to stretch our vacation budgets!  Our waitress had worked at Blueberry Hill for a while, and our great experience is probably influenced by the fact that she made sure each and every one of us ordered something we would love! Her advice was right on, and she was patient.     It's an easy 5- minute drive off the strip so tourists staying on the strip need a car.   If I lived in Vegas I would eat breakfast here frequently. (-: This is a diner...it ain't fancy, but it's extremely tasty, friendly, and a great value. (Save your pennies for the slot machines! (-: )  We all voted to eat here twice because we were tired of paying a bundle to eat on the strip and then being disappointed with the food on the strip. We found Blueberry Hill on yelp. There is more than one location.  We selected this location. THANKS yelpers!  Unlike a previous reviewer, I chose not to deduct any stars for decor. This is a diner...it looks like a diner. But it tastes like the BEST diner!  (-:  The menu is huge, so if you happen to get a new waitress, it's possible she may not be able to direct you towards the very best dishes. We were lucky as our waitress knew what to recommend when we asked questions."}
{"text":"It's not a trip to Vegas for me without at least 2 breakfasts at Blueberry Hill.  Why would I bother with long waits in the hotel, rubbery eggs, Sysco supplied pancake mix?  Blueberry Hill does it from scratch, and they do it right.  They claim that they started their empire with pancakes and I believe it.  I'm not even a pancake fan, but after watching plate after plate go by during each visit, I finally ordered some blueberry ones.  Light, fluffy, the tiniest bit of crisp griddle edge.  Buttery.  Delicious!    Their blueberry muffins are very good, also made from scratch.  Our server recommended we order it split and grilled, where they cut it in half, butter the sides, and grill it until warm.  Much better than microwaved and calorie free!  (Well, no, not really calorie free.  In fact, the exact opposite.)  I've never tried their lunch or dinner options, Blueberry Hill is all about breakfast for me.  Coffee is good too!"}
{"text":"Me and My Mom's favorite place! They have daily specials that include desserts and they make fresh homemade desserts daily!!!! Blueberry muffins are amazing, of course Mom loves the Chocolate Cake!  Fresh comfort food, the Chicken noodle soup is a winner, I loved the Pot Roast and the Patty melt. Wow! I think I need to go on a diet after talking about all that food! I'd also like to mention the staff, Linda the manager is very friendly! The waitresses are very nice Toni, Linda, Brenda to name a few! We've been going there for over 20 years, we can always count on a good breakfast, lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"They have other locations. Clean, good service and a wide variety on the menu. Not a stand out but it serves it purpose"}
{"text":"I love the blueberry family restaurant! I always go to the one of Decatur because I live close by but this one, service was not good. The server was very rude to us for no reason and the food was not as good as it usually is. Very disappointed, will not be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Amazing as always. Corned beef hash skillet is phenomenal, service is great!!!! I love this location."}
{"text":"Best breakfast place ever!!!! Love the home-style breakfast!! Their coffee always so fresh!!!  My princess always gets the blueberry boy!! With the shake that's awesome!!!"}
{"text":"This is the better version of IHOP. Many more food choices and very friendly waitresses!  I recommend trying their Honey Coconut Chicken Salad! Very delicious and healthy.   I just wish their most of their juices were free refills like orange juice."}
{"text":"What can I say ... a \"short stack\" of pancakes  (not short on the calories) for brekkie is the ultimate indulgence.  Tastes even better when you're in Vegas on vackay.  It has a regular old school diner feel and I love it.  Forgot to review this place from my last visit there.  Coffee is also smooth."}
{"text":"Big breakfasts ... good coffee, pancakes are nice and fluffy, good service.  My favourite breakfast place in Vegas.  Love American breakfasts!"}
{"text":"First time here for late breakfast , it is absolutely beautiful spot , your order gets in super fast crew are super passionate and responsive. I ordered one of the Mexican style breakfast dish it was just wow. Highly recommend it to all style of food you would love to get , blueberry hill has it all"}
{"text":"When I moved here from Reno one of the things I missed most was my favorite breakfast spot Pegs...   Blueberry hill has helped fill that void!! The pancakes are yummy! The biscuits and gravy were so good, and I love the skillets!   The place always seems busy, but we never wait very long. The service is great! Some of the people working there have been there for years.. I asked, so they know service!   Boyfriends eggs came out a little runny once, and before he could really say anything our server saw it and had it fixed immediately!"}
{"text":"Like the cozy homie diner feel as soon as I walked in to the lobby of the restaurant.   We were immediately seated (for 2) and our server promptly took our drink order and the server wisely suggested a fresh cup of roasted coffee that I accepted.  We ordered the Chicken Fried Steak which came with hash browns, two eggs, country fried steak over two biscuits covered in country gravy. We also ordered the belgian waffles with a side order of three sausage links.   The great thing about this restaurant is that I can order sweet and savory breakfast entrees all for an affordable price."}
{"text":"Saw Blueberry Hill on Diners Drive Ins and Dives and was kinda excited but once I found out they didn't have fresh blueberries I was pissed. I love giant locally growned blueberries, but their blueberries looked like they needed to be hooked up to an IV. This place was just too plain with all the life sucked out. I've had better breakfasts at Denny's.  If you get anything get the half Biscuits and Gravy comes with eggs and 2 sausage links, cheap and it will fill you up. Like too many other breakfast joints they're waffles are too sweet and pancakes too heavy."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY THE BEST OLD FASHIONED PANCAKES IN LAS VEGAS! (maybe the world).  The Good: 1. Extremely Friendly Staff make you think you are living in a small town. 2. Huge Menu of great tasting food. 3. Reasonable Prices and Great Daily Specials! 4. Open 24 hour (yes in a row too).  The Bad: 1. It is a diner, so not a pristine place.  Recommend you take guests from out of town to this favorite of mine. You cannot go wrong here!"}
{"text":"If you are hungry for pancakes this is the place to go. I had traditional buttermilk and they were perfect. My husband had blueberry and he said they were fabulous. I guess they must have been because he ate every bite and never offered me any lol. It was his birthday and they gave him a free slice of of cake, to go. We were too full from all the yummy pancakes. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"This restaurant made my entire trip worth coming to Las Vegas, NV!  HANDS DOWN....the BEST pancake place I've ever eaten at.  My mouth enveloped the most buttery, lightest buttermilk pancakes ever.  Crispy bacon (by order) with scrambled eggs and sausage.    Forget the sausage and eggs.  I was into the pancakes and bacon.  Everything I saw coming out of the kitchen looked yummy.  A guy next to me had the Chilaquiles Verde and my goodness Im gonna have to switch up how I eat breakfast.  Spoke with Phil (host) and he was so delightful.  Our server Violeta was very attentative to our needs.  This place makes homemade almost everything!!!  Its like a truck stop/diner pit stop type place.   Named after Chuck Berry's song Blueberry Hill!  Well, I've found my thrill at this place with the best food!"}
{"text":"Our family found BBH when we lived in Vegas back in 2000-2002. The kids always enjoyed their pancakes & eggs there.  Every time we're back in town we can't not visit and have the scrumptious pancakes, plus all the other yummy foods...steak omelette,  corned  beef hash omelette, boneless porkchop dinner, to name only a few.  Ous fave server is Suzie! Always courteous,  smile on her face and she loves the babies."}
{"text":"I love coming here because it's open 24hours. I love the selection of food. I absolutely love their pies and they have the best coffee. The service is pretty good, too."}
{"text":"My go to place for breakfast. Reminds me of an east coast diner. Simple, good, home worked food. Staff are real people who are quick and courteous but won't bother you with fancy frills. I love this place because it doesn't try to be something that it's not (fancy or full of gimmicks).   Omlets are HUGE (made with 4 eggs where most diners use 3) and the pancakes are a meal in itself (couldn't finish the whole grain pancakes and I can normally eat for 2). Would recommend, will def be back soon!!"}
{"text":"Chicken and waffle is definitely the way to go. Today's choice is Honey Coconut Chicken Waffle."}
{"text":"I love breakfast anytime. This place is great when there is really no where else to go. I mean the food is great and the serivce even better.   Me and my daughter went on a hunt for some great cheap breakfast.  I found the great, but it is not so cheap.  Natalie had a stack of 3 pancakes. She worked her way through 2.  I have to say these are so fluffy and warm with butter melting on top...Mmmm they are so good.  I had french toast with fruit and a sausege omlette with cheddar cheese. This was great as well. Everything was really well cooked and perfect portions.   Here is why they are getting -1 star. The small apple juice, which is smalled than a 12oz can is $2.99. Say WTF My total bill was $30.28  The server was really great."}
{"text":"Okay....their Alaskan Waffles (large waffle with ice cream, warm fruit compote, and whipped cream) are to DIE for but I'm not sure there is much else I like there."}
{"text":"Okay, so we visited this place twice.  5 stars are for the first visit and the food. The loss of 2 stars is for the waitress at the 2nd visit and the charge of the Alfredo sauce.   First trip was on a Saturday later in the day.  Great, great service and amazing food.  The sourdough toast was so good, we asked our waitress if it was made on site.  She let us know it was purchased from Great Buns Bakery down the street, which we have bought from twice since our visit.    We were so impressed with the service and the food, that we looked at this as our new go to family spot.  We had multiple breakfast items and chicken strips.   2nd visit today, sucked!  We were immediately greeted and sat down.  The waitress overwhelmed by a family with 6 screaming kids at 2 combined tables came over and greeted us quickly; great right?  It went downhill from there.  We even questioned ourselves what did we do wrong that she seemed \"bothered and annoyed\" by us.  We were overly friendly and ordered simple items. I ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo with extra Alfredo sauce.  My daughter ordered the chicken strips with honey mustard.  When the waitress brought the food which was quit quickly there was no honey mustard and no extra Alfredo sauce, and I didn't notice until she had walked away.  As she was setting the plates down, I commented to her that on our last visit my daughter stated \"the chicken strips were the best she had ever had.\"  While telling the waitress this she didn't even look at me, she was looking behind me out the window.  Really, really, hate that.  We waited at our tables for her to come back around for the sauces.  It was 8 minutes before she came back, and that was with flagging her down.  It took another 4 minutes to get the honey mustard and another 3 minutes after that for the Alfredo sauce.    She brought us our check and then asked us which desserts we wanted that we had previously added to our meals . We ordered 2 blueberry muffins which were so delicious we decided to get 2 more to go.  The waitress came back over and I said to her \" Would it be too much of a problem to get 2 more muffins to go?\"  She picked up the check, paused, and then said \"It shouldn't be.\"  Really, it shouldn't be?  How about yes, yes, or yes.    This waitress sucked and completely ruined our opinion of this place.  I wish I knew the name of the other waitress so I could call before coming to make sure she was working.   I do have to say the Alfredo sauce had absolutely ZERO flavor and ZERO taste.  The best part of the Alfredo sauce she \"CHARGED ME FOR IT.\"  If she had put it extra on the meal as I had ordered, I probably wouldn't have been charged for it.  This cost her a chunk of her tip!!!!"}
{"text":"Naomi, Naomi, Naomi... Best waitress award goes to Naomi!  She brought us coffee from a fresh pot and was on top of our table for anything we needed!  After the bad experience at the other location this will be our new location to go to!  I had the chicken parm and it was pretty good.     We got those magnificent blueberry muffins to go; of course!"}
{"text":"SERVICE:  I guess as soon as they know they're not getting a tip out of it, they don't care! Here's my ordering experience: I sat at the bar, servers asked me if I needed help, but as soon as I said I was ordering \" to go\" they all ran and said \"SHE'll be right with you\" whoever that was.... She finally came to take my order 20 minutes later. I got the Rum/coconut/pineapple waffle, then asked for their $6.50 special, it was supposed to be 3 eggs, 3 sausages or bacon, hash browns, and toast or english muffin. Since I don't like sausage or bacon, I asked if I could have pancakes instead.  I've NEVER had a problem substituting sausages for eggs or pancakes, but she hesitated and said \"yea but it'll be regular price not special price, which is $8\".  Fine, not a problem, $1.50 more whatever, \"Can I have the apple pancakes?\"  \"yea that's $2 extra, and you only get 2 not 4\"  That's fine too, then I said, \" with english muffin please\"   \"Oh, no you don't get toast, because you're already getting the pancakes.\" then she turn around and left!  I had to yell above the noise just to get her back, \"UH EXCUSE ME! I thought the pancakes were replacing my sausage/bacon not toast!, PLUS I'm paying $4 extra for them.\"  She didn't respond and reached for an english muffin, and put it in the toaster without even turning toward me!  FOOD: Waffle: the waffle itself has a nice texture, but the toping is wayyyy too sweet and pie-filling-like, and the pineapple is not fresh, it's from a can. not worth the $8.50.  Pancakes: they might as well call these \"cakes\" and not \"pancakes\"! they have absolutely no texture or taste of having been on a griddle, I bet thy baked them! each one is about 3/4 of an inch thick and fluffy/crumbly as hell! If you like your pancake to taste like cake, then this would be your thing, but I prefer my pancakes to be just pancakes. they are also too salty and have too much baking soda which makes them extremely tannic.  Their description also said that there were apples baked into the pancakes topped with fresh apple slices and compote (apple sauce), but there wasn't any of these things: no apple in the plain pancakes, compote was actually a jelly/custardy substance like in a bad apple pie, fresh apple slices were cooked apple chunks.   Hash browns: hash browns are supposed to be crispy, shredded potato, not chopped up, day-old, fettucine!   the 1 English muffin for which I was charged $1 extra: completely burned center with about 1/2 inch edible border.   Whipped cream that topped the pancakes and waffle: out of a can! you'd think that a \"family style\" diner would whip some real cream, but no.   Eggs: plain old scrambled eggs, difficult to screw up.  the only thing that tasted as expected in this meal."}
{"text":"Been here 24 minutes. No coffee refill yet. Slow service and no one's even here its empty."}
{"text":"During my semi-regular visits to Vegas this is one of my favorite places to hit up for breakfast.  I have heard  quite a bit of positive buzz about their pancakes but since I am mostly partial to omelettes for my first meal of the day I tend to stick mostly with their chorizo & eggs which is always served in large portions.  Decently priced and with helpful service the only downside are some of the regulars who tend to be retirees who take forever to make their decisions which ocassionally means you have to wait for service to make their way to you."}
{"text":"Stopped by for breakfast before heading back to texas!  A lot of food, all pretty darn good. Thank you."}
{"text":"This place was good, but not mind-blowing. For some breakfast in Vegas, great stop. It is essentially a non-commercial version of IHOP--similar prices, dishes, etc. however I must say their blueberry pancakes were bomb. We went in with a table of 8 and were seated relatively quickly, were asked what we wanted to order in less than a minute (which was kind of overwhelming with this size of the menu), re-asked quickly and served quickly.   In having gotten the blueberry pancakes for myself I was quite pleased with my meal (plus potatoes, eggs and sausages on the side), however others at my table got the cornbeef hash (ehh, ok), a Tex-Mex style omelet (ok), and other variations.   They have large portions and I may return. Probably not, for breakfast previously I went to a cafe in the Venetian which was cute, quaint, and delish."}
{"text":"Disgusting and dirty place. My boyfriend, friend and I came in last week to meet up with my boyfriend's family. This older, skinnier Caucasian lady didn't even greet us and she said \"How many?\" We told her there's 3 of us but we are meeting up with my boyfriend's family. Her facial expression automatically changed and the vibe went bad. She was being rude and was pissed about having to move all of us to a bigger table so that we could fit. She was in a bad mood and did not even apologize for her unprofessional behavior. If only I had gotten her name!! On top of all of this, the booths felt sticky and there was big crumbs on the floor. Never again!!!   ALSO they don't serve avocado."}
{"text":"If you're in Vegas and looking for a good breakfast at a good price this is the place.  It's a diner style restaurant located about five minutes off the strip and while it isn't as fancy as places on the strip it doesn't need to be.  The waitresses are friendly and prompt, and our food always came out fairly quickly.  They have a wide selection of dishes and we have no complaints so far.  The only suggestion I have for anyone looking to go is make sure you go early especially on weekends as it fills up quickly.  We have eaten here twice during our current stay in Vegas and will definitely be repeat customers on our next trip as well.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Found this diner while driving around Las Vegas. Looked up the reviews on yelp and decided to go in. This was our third trip to Vegas and the more I go, the less I want to eat at a casino. The casino buffets are convenient but I always feel I just paid 25.99$ to eat at Old Country Buffet!   Ate breakfast two mornings in a row. This place is open 24/7 and you can get any item at any time. First morning I had the Chicken Waffles, West Coast style, it's a big home made waffle with home made chicken fingers put on top of it with yummy salted butter scooped into it and you just pour the syrup over ever thing. Sweet and salty, very good! I was with friends and there was an order of steak and eggs with pancakes at our table. Their pancakes are amazing. Big, light, and fluffy  with big scoops of the salted butter... UMMMMM food coma! Oh yes and not to be forgotten coffee was excellent and service was amazing. Waitress was happy to serve us, and was always refilling coffee and water glasses.   Second morning.... I wasn't in the mood for breakfast, we were getting ready to leave Las Vegas via car to Los Angeles and I didn't want anything too sweet. So I had the bacon cheese burger and fries.... excellent! Friends had the chorizo omelet and the other one had the french toast. I had thought their best plate was pancakes... I was wrong, the french toast was even better. Everything was perfect, right amount of being cooked, not soggy, not squished, not hard, cinnamon and powered sugar and then the salted butter on top.... it was the best french toast I've ever eaten.    We will be back to Vegas at the end of our road trip and we plan on going back. The waitresses and the manager (or owner?) spent time talking to us and made us feel welcomed.  This is absolutely a don't miss when you are in Vegas."}
{"text":"Service was mediocre at best. Only had 4 water glasses delivered to table for a 6-top. Had to ask 3 times for extra water, still didn't get delivered. Had to get up to get my own water. After I received my water, the glass had residue from coca cola still stuck to the inside of the glass. Appetizers came out with the food instead of before. Breakfast Bacon was floppy, extremely undercooked. When I sent it back to the kitchen less than a minute later the bacon came out again, more cooked however unless they had 3 identical pieces of bacon already cooking in the kitchen, they just threw the bacon in the microwave to cook more, or they have bacon sitting under a heat lamp. My table ordered a grilled cheese with bacon. Got back a single piece of melted cheese with a pile of undercooked bacon shoved between two slices of bread. Ordered French toast. The toast was sogged all the way through with batter and completely undercooked. Some of the food was OK, nothing spectacular. To say the least, this restaurant doesn't deserve the title of best coffee house/diner from the Las Vegas Review Journal."}
{"text":"The service here is immaculate. Very kind waitresses. I got some super sugary French toast, I only ate one piece. The toast was also really buttery. But good place to grub! Even at 330am"}
{"text":"Update: the manager Linda made it more than right! The girl who answered the phone should take notes! Thank you for making it right BBH, my clients look forward to coming back.   Been here lots of times, always nice service... however I found mold on the corn bread a 95 year old is supposed to eat, mold on it!! Called and this young girl said thanks for letting me know! Hangs up. I would've let it go if she apologized, but she didn't, so I called back, the manager Linda was very nice and professional. She said she would give the man a refund."}
{"text":"Not quite as good as other locations..eggs had to go back and the pancakes rubbery. The bill was pricey for the quality.. There are so many other choices nearby I won't return here."}
{"text":"Why can't they have these kinds of restaurants everywhere!! I really love everything about Blueberry Hill. They have amazing food, excellent service, prices are good, and the location is also easy to find.   Food, food, food is what you get here. Anything you order here comes in large portions! I made the mistake of ordering several things when I first came here as I didn't know they give you a lot. Love the fresh fruit waffles and pancakes, Classic Egg Benedict, Bacon and cheese omelet, Meat Lover's skillet, and so many more of the items. Can't go wrong with the food here and they have something for everyone. They are always willing to customize an order for you also if you don't like something that a dish comes with. Yum Yum Yum!  The wait staff here are nice, but usually super busy so you can be waiting around awhile for them to bring your drinks, food or just come around to check up on you. Some are more friendly and make sure their customers are happy and some are just there doing their job and nothing more.   The building looks older, but not run down. The inside is older looking, but maybe they're trying to keep that \"diner\" look going, They have two sides which they usually keep only one side open if they don't have many customers. They don't have a problem with keeping the place full though, especially on the weekend. Tables are clean almost immediately when people leave so other people can be seated. Floors are kept clean and mopped when they need it. Bathrooms have always been cleaned no matter the time of day I've come.   Will be back many more times and would recommend this spot."}
{"text":"I had a great omelet here and my husband cleaned the plate of his chorizo scramble.  The food was delicious and the service was good.  Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This place was exactly what we needed. Quick service and classic diner brekky If definitely recommend  this place to anyone needing a break from the casinos!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness the food was DELICIOUS. Bertha, the waitress was very sweet. They have sugar free syrup which was great for me!! The atmosphere was wonderful and everyone is very friendly. 11/10 would recommend. Not too much of a wait either. :)"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times before, mostly at night. Went tonight for dinner and my god. I'm NEVER one to be insulted by what I got. Slight errors, whatever.   Ordered a sirloin, medium, specifically asked for mushrooms and bacon. Was offered that the mushrooms be sauteed, chose it. Steak came out undercooked, the mushrooms looked and tasted like they came straight out of the can and maybe only warmed by the steak, and in a clump on the side. No bacon to be seen anywhere, except in it's place, next to the clump of mushrooms, was a clump of onions. A little irked by this, I immediately asked for a side of bacon, stating I'd pay for it, whatever, but stated I never said anything about onions.   Bacon came out, small mostly fatty awful looking garbage. The coffee I ordered also tasted terrible, was luke warm, etc.  I don't blame the servers, they were fine. Cook was pure shit.   Mind you, I grew up in the crappier parts of cities, so I can appreciate a bad diner, but this was like... I don't even know. I wouldn't feed it to dogs, and if I didn't feel bad for the servers, I'd have dine and dashed, leaving only a tip. Used to be good, I dunno what happened, but whoever the cook is should lose his/her job."}
{"text":"Really legit breakfast stop. We tried chicken & waffles, Full House Breakfast (blueberry crepes, poached egg), hashbrowns.... All was very good. Coffee was good, too. Service was very nice! Only complaint: hashbrowns cooled off quick. It happens. Desserts looked DAMN good, but we have another 2.75 mile hike back to the Venetian ahead of us. We'll be back some day for the treats!"}
{"text":"I woke up this morning with a crazy craving for French Toast. I went to \"Yelp\" for help on where to go. This place came up and my husband and I thought we'd give it a try since it's not too far from home.   Upon entering the restaurant you get the feel of an old time diner. The decor and food (including the booth we set in with the cracked faux leather) is completely antiquated. I had a bad feeling but was hoping we stumbled upon a hidden gem. I ordered the French toast (the reason for us coming here) and the Hubbs ordered the corned beef hash. It took 20 mins or so to receive our food. As it was delivered we noticed immediately that our choices weren't on point. My husbands corned beef was greasy, eggs over cooked and it looked like a child (or someone who didn't belong in the kitchen) buttered and cut his toast. You could literally see a huge thumb print imprinted in the toast! My French toast was OK, nothing special and my turkey sausage was over cooked and had hash browns cooked on to them even though no one ordered hash browns! My husband complained to our server about his meal which he only picked at. She took it back and still charged us for the eggs and potatoes he didn't eat. Rather than cause more confusion we cashed out the check and left not wanting to waste anymore time at this place. Will we ever come back? Absolutely Not..."}
{"text":"Best Turkey dinner I've found in Las Vegas.  Sunday special, $10.79 includes soup or salad, roasted turkey, mashed potatoes, dressing, vegetable, & dessert.  Large portion so you better be hungry however it's also great leftovers!!"}
{"text":"Big ol' portions of greasy diner food. Treat it like a Denny's--breakfast or sandwiches only--and it's okay,   Staff is kind, but it's overpriced and way too junky for me to bother with again."}
{"text":"I got the steak fajitas. The steak was tender, rice and beans were good and the flour tortillas were perfect. The steak was not seasoned well so I had to add a lot of salt and pepper and I never add salt to my food. Maybe I should have tried a breakfast dish. Staff was friendly and service was pretty fast."}
{"text":"Had a late breakfast here with a co-worker who's local and a big fan of this place.  It was the same to me as any average NJ diner I've ever been to.  Nothing really special here.  I ordered an omelette and some pancakes.  Ate maybe half of it as it really wasn't all that good.  I can see this being a popular late night spot if you've been out drinking all night."}
{"text":"Overkill on amount of food you get. The menu is crazy and overwhelming. Service sucks."}
{"text":"Will try again for breakfast--we ended up going for dinner. The cheeseburger I had was just OK; not anything to write home about. My father didn't say anything about his chicken fried steak he ordered. Chocolate strawberry cake was moist. Service was fast and the waitress was very nice and happy to answer questions. They have several things on the menu I'm interested in so I'm willing to go back. Was just OK in my opinion on this visit."}
{"text":"I came here expecting large portions like many reviewers had stated, and was actually surprised at how small my meal was. I ordered the eggs benedict, which was decent but nothing to write home about.  My side of hashbrowns was so small that I hardly got to taste anything.  What little I did taste was bland and unflavorful (nothing a little salt and ketchup can't fix).  I will say that it was definitely a better experience in terms of service and quality of food in comparison to Hash House, but I can't help but feel a little let down.  I wouldn't avoid coming to this place like I would other breakfast establishments, but I definitely wouldn't make it a point to go out of my way for it, either."}
{"text":"My 2nd visit to a Blueberry Hill in the Las Vegas area.  While the other one on Tropicana was good - this one near Nellis AFB has a well run vibe to it.  The hostess and server were both friendly and very attentive.  I would guess all the staff here are somewhat related to the air force base and were all high energy.  Looking around it seemed the patrons were mostly active or retired military.  Food was great and the next time in town I will come here for my Blueberry Hill fix."}
{"text":"While the servers are excellent, very friendly, and do their job with pride, the cooks seem to have a blatant disregard for the needs of the customer. If they took enough time to read the order on the tickets instead of messing around and talking with each other, my order, and the orders of the tables next to me would not have taken as long, and would have been correct."}
{"text":"Horrible !! I had time to kill before returning to my doctors office . I am on crutches as I struggle with opening the door a waitress and manager state dead at me and didn't bother to help . Just looked and went back to their conversation because they couldn't be bothered ! I was seated and I wasn't in the mood to eat a large portion breakfast so I ordered off the kids menu the waitress attempted to tell me that basically I couldn't do that because I need to be 12 or under !! I looked at her and said I have never been told I can't order off a kids menu ever anywhere !! She said she would do it this one time lol !! Like , where do they tell you what you can order ?! !? My waitress was to busy yapping with the customers table across from me then anything ! On the way out was the kicker ! This is for you Karen you need to be careful when your talking mess about a customer that's right in front of your face ! I caught your dirty look and roll of eyes when I asked you for a receipt and a bag for my left overs ! As this lady was to busy eating her muffin at the front desk to be botherd to provide proper customer service !! Haven't you ever been told its not a good look to eat in front of customers ?? Thats not even the worst of my experience but rather her disgusting attitude and thinking customers are dumb not to catch your dirty looks and crap talking ! Get another job lady because , you clearly do not belong in the front of the house dealing with customers maybe join the dish washer in the back as I am sure he could use a helping hand !"}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place in Las Vegas!   Skip the plastic tasting IHOP and Denny's and come here!   It was my second time here,  and I don't remember much from my first visit,  but I had an excellent experience today.    There was no line for tables,  and we were seated right away in a booth.    The menu here is huge!  There is something for everyone here.  There are breakfast,  lunch and dinner items plus dessert.   I ordered the spinach cheese omelet with French toast and coffee,  my other half ordered spaghetti and meatballs.     I really enjoyed my omelet.   It was cooked perfectly with the right amount of spinach and cheese.   The French toast was a delight.   The maple syrup is served warm and made the French toast even more delectable.    Coffee was great with a variety of creamers to use.    The bf's spaghetti and meatballs was the right portion size.   His meal also came with a drink and dessert.   We got a slice of cherry pie to go since we were both full and when we ate it later it was a party in our mouths.    I am most coming back here next time I am in LV."}
{"text":"We went to the Blueberry hill that is on flamingo and near the olive garden. (there are 2 BH right near ea. other on flamingo? strange but convenient i guess. ) It was so packed when we went and it was about 10 am on a sat. morn. A bus load of people got there after us so we just beat this huge monster line. I went with the belgian waffle that had fresh fruit on top - bananas, apples, strawberries, and blueberries of course. my fav of all was the bananas and blueberries. If i ordered this again id def stick to those 2 for the whole thing. omg. it was really good. but paled in comparison to my bf chicken fried steak order. wow. that was good but waayyy less healthy.  The atmosphere was your typical diner and it was really cute and quaint. The food came out super quick and made me wonder wow - how many people are back there b/c the place was really full. I'd def. go back to this place, and its cheaper than hash house a go go."}
{"text":"Ate breakfast here for the first time today.  Awesome food!  There is an iHop close by, avoid going to there and go to this restaurant instead.  Friendly staff, good food, big menu selection, and the prices are decent.  I will definitely go back here."}
{"text":"The blueberry crepes here were delicious! I did not feel rushed and our server was very kind. Stopping by Vegas for the night, I would stop here again for a casual occassion. I agree with the other reviews, the quality is much better than the other [chain] diners. Stop by, have a good meal, don't spend a lot... Perfect."}
{"text":"Everything was SOOO delicious From the coffee to the eggs to the pancakes. What a gem we stumbled upon!!"}
{"text":"The best of the best for old fashioned quality . The french toast is to die for. Caution their omelets are made with 4 eggs and the selection of side include 3 buttermilk pan cakes. Most couples split this dish. The service is superior. The coffee pot is in constant refill rounds action. I highly recommend this restaurant as I have returned over 75 time and never had anything less than the highest quality."}
{"text":"Excellent service plus 10. Had my favorite liver and onions...skipped potatoes and got steamed vegetables. Total perfect. As a matter of fact everything they offer is picture perfect. Been eating at all there places for 8 yrs never had a off meal."}
{"text":"I have been here for breakfast a few times now. The most recent was on Valentines day.  We thoroughly enjoyed it and will be back.  The atmosphere is right up our alley.  We like that homey, small town feel and that's just what Blueberry Hill offers.  It reminds me of the little cafe's back home.  The food is not the most amazing I've ever had, but it is very good.  The pancakes and French toast are really tasty.  For me, what put them over the top was the hot blueberry syrup I poured over the top with big blueberries in it!  That was super!  The service was pretty good.  I've had very few places in Vegas offer poor service though.  If you've traveled other places you probably know what I mean - we tend to, overall, have really good service here in the Vegas area.   It's not our go to breakfast spot, because of proximity, but if they were closer it would certainly be on the short list."}
{"text":"BREAKFAST HEAVEN. Been here twice, both times for breakfast. I've had the eggs Benedict one time and cinnamon roll pancakes another time.   Brisk service in that old family owned, diner vibe. You feel like a regular on your first visit. Weekends are super busy so I usually head for the counter and grab a stool with no waiting.  I mean the food is good but the service is amazing. I come for the service and I always leave feeling good. This place is managed with a sense of excellence and is a well-oiled machine."}
{"text":"Best waffles I've had in a while.. I like that it's open 24 hrs and have a big variety of food."}
{"text":"This is easily the best breakfast I've had in Vegas. It's better than buffets on the Strip, and cheaper. The French Toast was what cinched it. Best ever. The eggs I ordered were cooked perfectly as was the bacon. I tasted some biscuit and gravy off my fiancee's plate and it was outstanding as well. Coffee was meh. Decor is way dated and the place needs a remodel. The staff is very nice and attentive. Our server even went so far as to try to explain to us how to cook french toast that good. Instead of doing that though, we're just going to come back here next time we're in town."}
{"text":"Food is really good.  My waffle with fresh fruit was very good.  They type of waffle that doesn't require syrup, light and fluffy.  I had apples, strawberries, blueberries and bananas on the waffle.  The apple were cut in a weird way -think small matchsticks,  but that was the only negative.  Service was outstanding."}
{"text":"Terrible. We waited nearly 20 minutes for someone to take our order... two other groups of people came in and had they're orders taken right away and we're served food! We paid for our orange juice and left! The manager said \"They ate\" as we walked by. We sure didn't!! Couldn't even get our order taken. Terrible service."}
{"text":"It's a diner. I've been to 3 of the locations - all on Flamingo. The one on W Flamingo nearest the Strip looks more like a nice restaurant then a diner but the food is still diner delicious and the staff is exceptionally nice & accommodating.  The one on E Flamingo/Sandhill .. Food not as good & the waitress would not shut up & leave us alone. I didn't go there to have a conversation with her. Clearly we were having date night. Go. Away. Both times I was there it was like that. Maybe because it was late night & she was bored, but I did not appreciate it. The other one on E Flamingo is the bomb diggity do da. It was the first one we discovered shortly after moving here & still my most favorite late night diner. The food is huge portions, good pricing, appropriately attentive staff."}
{"text":"With seven Blueberry Hill Family Restaurants in town, we were bound to try at least one of them by now.  With four famished marathon runners, we needed a place to grub down and luckily someone suggested Blueberry Hill (a favorite for him).  He chose this location as his regular joint.  I was a little concerned with how long the wait might be on a Sunday around noon, but the wait was only ten minutes or so.  Thank goodness!  After getting seated, huge menus were given to us.  Woah!  This restaurant is open 24 hours and the menu reflects that.  There's a whole lot of menu to go through, especially the breakfast items alone!  Definitely take your time making your decision!  * Golden Stuffed French Toast \" Four thick wedges of French toast stuffed with cream cheese and lavished with your choice of fresh strawberry or blueberry or apple compote, or pineapple spiced rum and coconut compote.\" ($7.79) - The French Toast was recommended by the regular and I went for the blueberry topping (obviously), although the pineapple spiced rum and coconut one did tempt me just a bit.  I loved the sweetness from the fruit topping and whipped cream, but then I would get this tangy sour taste from the cream cheese as well.  I wasn't sure if I was enjoying that part or not.  But I still ate it all up nonetheless!   * Chicken Fried Steak Southern- Style \"U.S.D.A. Certified Choice breaded steak served over our new recipe biscuits and smothered in homemade country gravy.  Served with two extra large eggs and hashbrowns.\" ($10.79) - The Husband is always getting these super fatty dishes and couldn't resist here either.  Although the menu says it served over biscuits, I couldn't really remember if it was and from the picture, I don't see any.  He did get a choice of bread with it and went for the sourdough toast option.  I do want to talk about that sourdough bread - they give out these thick slices of bread and they are yum!    Service - pretty standard service for a busy diner during the weekend brunch rush.  She forgot the tea bag when our friend ordered the tea, but did come around with pots of coffee for refills.  They have seasonal specials to look out for - I think they had pumpkin pancakes on the menu when we went. Keep your eye out for the blackboard when you first walk in."}
{"text":"We decided to trek out of our usual today and head over to the land of pancakes.  The parking was a little cramped, but that was probably because of the church bookstore next door.  We got inside and were seated right away.  I didn't like that the waitress brought us little cups of water, and no straws.  I prefer to drink out of a straw, because you never know where the cup has been.  After reading through their enormous selection, we both finally decided on fruit pancakes (she had blueberry, I had strawberry) and a side of potatoes.  Boy, was ordering the potatoes a horrible idea!  When the waitress brought out the food, my stomach flopped.  The portion size of the pancakes is incredible!  Four huge pancakes smothered in blueberry/strawberry compote, whipped cream, and real fruit!  Time to dig in...  The pancakes were AMAZING.  I had as much as my tummy could possibly hold.  The potatoes were average, and tasted pretty good with salt and smothered in ketchup.  Paired along with the coffee we had, I would say I am going to be full until tomorrow.  Extremely good pancakes, friendly service, and causal atmosphere.  A little on the spendy side for pancakes and coffee - we spent $14 each.  Sure is different during the daylight hours.  I usually end up here after a night of partying.    I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"My mom's friend recommended this place to us for breakfast, and compared to the prices on the strip it is cheap, but by 'home' standards it was an expensive breakfast.  Clearly it's a popular spot because it was packed, but since there were only three of us we got a table in about 10 minutes.  They err on the side of giving you a ton of food and charging a lot - there were not many entrees available that weren't going to be ginormous.  Service was friendly but very slow.  Since we didn't know what we wanted the moment we sat down, the server gave us 'a minute'...really she gave us 15 minutes before she came back.  Whoops.  The food was ok, better than Denny's or IHOP but nothing too exciting.  I had french toast and a ham & cheese omelette.  They did have a huge menu and lots of selections.    It's not a bad choice if you want to get away from the strip and have a cheaper meal than you can get there.  But I wouldn't go too far out of your way for it."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic gem of a find. Oversized, flavorful breakfast food.  Service was not so hot at 11pm, but the food was so good I didn't care.  24 hour. They had non-breakfast food,  but I did not partake."}
{"text":"Great breakfast for great prices! The french toast was awesome, light, fluffy and a perfect fit for the strawberries. Yummy! We will come back."}
{"text":"Outstanding breakfast place but must say the whole menu is enticing!  We were sent here on recommendation of local friend much to our delight.  Must say the French Toast was unbelievably good.  4 separate entrees with sides that could not have been better tasting or of better preparation.  A \"will return\" when in Vegas!!!!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here before heading back to Arizona. Super legit! The omelets are massive and so are the pancakes. Great portions and worth every dollar, I will be coming back next time I'm in Vegas! Thanks for the great service and food!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here over several days during our visit to vegas, as our hotel only offered fast food or crappy buffet options. My honey would rate this place higher than me, as he loved their pancakes. Bacon was very yummy. Eggs cooked well to order. Love that they perfectly toast your bread ( major pet peeve with me at breakfast joints) Coffee was very good, service spot on...only complaint is their god aweful potatoes! Both the hashbrowns and breakfast taters are undercooked and just plain yuck!  If they had better spuds, I would have loved this place as much as my honey did."}
{"text":"Ok this place still amazes me with there food and service. I had friends in town again and we went for breakfast the other day and as expected perfect. I highly recommend getting the biscuits and gravy AMAZING..."}
{"text":"The place is dirty. I asked my girlfriend if she wanted to walk out but she and my Mom wanted to eat, fast. So, we knocked the crumbs off the table, requested a new place setting for the one with food on the utensils and napkin, and settled in.  I ordered the Chicken and Waffles, it said drenched in honey, but I only found a trickle in the chicken so I had to ask for syrup, but there was plenty of butter. The waffle was good, the chicken was really good.  My Mother got the Huevos Ranchers, and asked for the milder sauce, her eggs were perfect, and she liked the flavor.  My GF got the Ham, and Eggs, with potatoes. She attempted to chisel through the cardboard ham, it was bad enough that the waitress stopped  to ask if it was ok. She whisked it away and brought back a rather decent ham steak.  Suzi the waitress was really good, kept our coffee coming, but she was also brash, which is ok with us, but some people looked very put off.  I came here because I missed the Stuffed French Toast, but it isn't in the menu anymore. The kids menu, and senior menu doesn't start until after breakfast.  The parking is squeezed and awkward around the restaurant, but is attached to the Dollar Store parking which is giant.  I'm really torn between two or three stars, but the level of filth, on the walls, glass, and behind the counter, leaves me feeling I would mislead people if I erred on the 3star side."}
{"text":"Come early because this place surely generates a crowd.....Free parking in the rear but it did take me about five minutes to catch a spot. Food was a good mix between Cracker Barrel and iHOP but certainly provided that home cooking flavor that one can desperately seek while being in Las Vegas. Coffee was so so......would not recommend but the pancakes, sausage and everything else gets my nod of approval."}
{"text":"I've only been here once but my one experience was great! So we went and we were seated immediately. We thought it was going to be busier, but it doesn't get that busy around dinner time. We were instantly approached by our waiter, who was in a bit of a mood but we ordered our drinks, and they came out quickly. We decided on what we wanted (Which was difficult since there were so many things we wanted!) and the waiter was quick to get our order ready and going. It took a little while for our food to come out, but there were multiple of us so it was expected.  Once I tried my food, it was nothing like I tasted before, it was so good!  That's the reason why I'm giving this place 5 stars. Very rarely do I go to a place, and find something that I absolutely love the first time trying it. This was one of those places. It was a bit more expensive than we thought it was going to be, but it was worth it. I would definitely go here again, and I recommend others to go here too!"}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast place I've ever been to outside of California so original and everything on the menu they really know how to spin pancakes. I went with the meatloaf and eggs that meatloaf was to die for I've never had anything so delicious in my life. I don't know how they do it but they got this thing working 24/7 but it's great!!!"}
{"text":"We went on September 29th during our weekend stay in Las Vegas.  We were looking for diner type breakfast as we were staying off the strip. I have to recommend this place as our entire group liked it and we were all pleased with the food and service. The prices are reasonable and you get a great portion for your meal. We will be back when visiting Vegas"}
{"text":"Place can get real, busy but 75% of the time it's a good dinning experience at time service can be a little slow even when the place is empty but food is always on the good side I give it 6/10 may be 7"}
{"text":"Whenever we take a trip to Vegas, we stop here at least once for breakfast or lunch. This location is always consistent with food and for the most part the service is decent. The manager always makes sure to keep the customers waiting for a table informed of the status, which makes the wait bearable. We brought my family for breakfast for the first time before heading home and the food was still great, but the waitress was disappointing. She rarely checked on us and the other waitress from a different section had to fill our coffee mugs. She then returns with an excuse that she didn't want us to think that she forgot us, but that she was waiting for a fresh pot. A bit of communication would've worked. She later on made sure to walk by and ignore us some more after seeing the small tip we left on our credit card slip. She is lucky we left any at all and it was only because we frequent that location often. The food is definitely the best out of all the locations we have tried. The blueberry pancakes, omelets, and waffles with chicken apple sausage are my favorites."}
{"text":"Came for breakfast and left with a new amazing spot whenever I'm in Vegas.  Their pancakes are the real deal, not add water mix, and I went with the Cinnamon Swirl short stack. The regular order is four pancakes, but my two were enough to take home as well. Their sausage was cooked to perfection, still plump and juicy on the inside, and my medium eggs were just this side of yolky perfection.  Our waitress was amazing, gave us great advice on what to order, and came through to check on us.  Definitely a spot I'll come back to again and again."}
{"text":"Haven't eaten here in awhile and remember it being delicious. This time I wasn't impressed.  my glass had orange juice crust on the outside and our hash browns looked and tasted old. My pancakes were great however ruining pancakes is a feat in itself. I wouldn't eat here again since I ended up paying $32.71 for three small plates and water.  For the money egg works or sunrise cafe are twice as good. Hope this was useful.  Also a small side not, there was a dog loose in their parking lot and I asked for a piece of bread or something to try and coax it to me and they were going to charge me for a side of sausages, I wasn't going to eat it! They lacked compassion and if you can't treat an animal right how can you treat a person right. No wonder the service was terrible."}
{"text":"Since moving to Vegas we have been looking for a place like this. In all fairness we only ate breakfast...wait what am I saying only ate breakfast. It was fantastic. But, just saying we did not eat any of there lunch or dinner options. Based on the menu though they look like they have a good selection. It has a diner/family restaurant feel. It reminds me of a restaurant back in SC we used to regular. Anyways we had pancakes, country fried steak, etc. and it was very good. Not the best in Vegas (see another one one of my posts), but easily second in my book. Definitely worth a visit if you have not been there. I only have one small complaint and that was the service was a little slow and she tried to deliver my plates to another table. But, they were very busy. We will return though because the food is so darn good!"}
{"text":"Was awesome!!!  Salsa authentic, and service outstanding...the drive onky 5 minutes from strip and free parking...The omlette was gigantic and only 1 dolla charge for egg whites.  Coffee was good too."}
{"text":"I devour my breakfast this morning and felt it was very delicious.   Not kidding.  It was packed at this place and they have other locations in Vegas."}
{"text":"Ever since I was little I've passed by this restaurant driving all over town, yet never have I stepped foot inside.  I was starving and in the mood for some good ol American brunch food that I convinced my boyfriend to come with.  The service was really nice, food came out quick, everything was huge in portions and so delicious.  -Coconut chicken with waffles (must try!) -Irish Eggs Benedict. I loooooveeeeee corn beef so I had to try and it was amazing. Yolk cooked so perfectly with the most amazing hollandaise sauce. Surprisingly just these two dishes had us stuffed and all for ~$13 per person? What a great deal ^_^ Thank you blueberry hill :3"}
{"text":"I'm not going to kid you. I questioned the judgment of the individual who brought me there, because he doesn't care about quality. It is not the nicest looking place. Fortunately, the Blueberry Hill is a good restaurant. I had their chicken special, which was sliced chicken breast on a bed of noodles, with some mixed vegetables. It was pretty average, but good quantity. I wondered if the place was popular with people who got liquored up.   Then I tried their carrot cake. While I love carrot cake, this carrot cake was superb. It was frosted so well; not with a big thick layer of frosting but nicely frosted so it wouldn't kill the taste of the cake itself. The cake was well textured and moist. I wanted to have some ice cream with it, but I think I would have been carried out of the place.  Our waitress was attentive and provided us the food on time; meaning hot.  If you're on a budget, want good food, especially breakfast like pancakes and French toast, I believe Blueberry Hill is a nice option."}
{"text":"This breakfast and dinner establishment is so cute! It is very retro, and the food options were incredible! There are literally like 200 different things on the menu that will accommodate any craving! I had exceptional service, did not wait long for my food, and left happy and full! Thanks BH!"}
{"text":"It's blueberry hill I guess it should be expected. Not the best food. But doesn't even meet up to fast food standards :/   I had spaghetti it was bland.   My parents had a crusted chicken Parmesan and that was decent.   Definitely scratching blueberry hill off the list of places to come back for breakfast lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Will not come back to eat here again (see previous review), but the BF has been on the quest to try all the pie in Vegas and this was one of the closest, convenient stops.   We took a whole cherry pie home out of the selection of 4fruit types and a few cream filled ones that were the selection of the day. They have a more extensive pie flavor selection that they rotate, or you can special order with 24 hours notice.   It was a pretty decent, but standard American diner pie. Enjoyed it, didn't love it, on to the next spot.   For a solid pie though, I'll bump up a star to A-OK."}
{"text":"classic family restaurant and I like it, but not enough to munch here all the time unless I've had a few drinks!   AMBIANCE: 3 - sometimes packed, sometimes not. Full of older people that have a passion for coffee and broke college kids that come here before class!   it's clean, but it's not like it's nice inside, it's basically a diner.   SERVICE: 3 - Service is slow slow slow! food wait time is average, but they keep you buzzed on coffee to forget that!   FOOD: 4 - pretty good for being so cheap! if you order the savory foods, it's definitely better than eating at ihop! some of the pancakes are just way too sweet, but holy cow, they are HUGE!"}
{"text":"Breakfast, Breakfast Breakfast. It seems there might be a recurring theme in my life here..I seem to eat breakfast a ton!! Blueberry Hill is a cheap family restaurant/diner experience. It is a semi-popular choice for people to eat food or breakfast at any time of day, as it is open 24 hours.   Ambiance: 3 - The diner look is okay. It's nothing fancy, but it isn't anything really special either. They keep clean for the most part. I feel like they could do something more to take you back to 'that time' when people stopped on road trips to grab a bite to eat from diners!   Service: 3 -  The service that I get is always slower than slow! I'm pretty lenient, too, I've waited almost an hour for food once! Also, there's usually not too many people when I go, so how slow it gets almost doesn't make sense.   Food: 4 - Food isn't gourmet, nor is it perfect. Yet, it's still a point above average!  They have huge portions and giant pancakes! I do like my steak and eggs here better than IHOP! And honestly, any breakfast place is better than Denny's. Also, my boyfriend said he really loved their chicken and waffles: \"They were delicious\". It almost feels like you're on the roadside havin a quick bite to get the job done--if there weren't so many buildings around!   Super early AM? Need some bacon? Well, maybe you should stop by blueberry hill, you breakfast lover, you!"}
{"text":"First of all, I will always, always, always sit at a counter when the opportunity presents itself.  So I was stoked to snag us a couple of stools at the bar next to a cake dome with some sort of chocolate monstrosity inside.  Mmmm....cake.....  But I digress.  We actually sought out this place by searching for chilaquiles in Vegas on Yelp!  Why?  Because I had a craving, that's why.  Therefore, I perused the menu merely as a formality before ordering up the Chilaquiles, Mexican-Style.  Luckily, I was not disappointed.  Check out my pics for the hefty portions of tortillas, eggs and ranchero sauce complemented with a small salad and perfectly roasted jalapeno.  All cooked to perfection.  F**k yeah I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Breakfast double blueberry crepes with a double blueberry pancake....sooooo good.  The waitress was darling awesome attentive and had a never ending coffee pot."}
{"text":"We used to live close by here. Been here many times. Never had a problem with food or service but until my last visit I had no idea that these were probably my favorite pancakes ever. Yes ever. Sweet and super fluffy smother in butter and syrup and you're in pancake heaven. I got the meat sampler on a Saturday morning it was on special for $9.99 and there was plenty of food to take home. It came with two huge pancakes, eggs, hash browns, bacon, ham and sausage. Meat lovers will be In heaven. Or perfect if you're like me and can never decide on something to order. It Comes with everything. The boyfriend got the coconut chicken and waffle. Crispy chicken and waffle. Perfect combo if you love sweet and savory. They also have lunch and dinner and a huge menu so something for everyone."}
{"text":"We enjoy Blueberry Hill the most of any restaurant in Vegas.  Yes, that includes all the high end places on the strip.  Sure, you can't get a filet, or garlic creamed spinach, or other typical high end items. What you do get is first-rate breakfast and lunch items delivered by hard-working, pleasant wait staff at terrific prices. Maybe the best pancakes I've ever had. Large portions of fresh eggs, bacon, sausage, potato latkes, fluffy waffles. Some mexican dishes. Pure comfort.  Don't miss it when you're in Vegas."}
{"text":"The food was delicious!  Huge portions and everything breakfast. Much better than any of the stuffy buffets.  Only reason 4 star is due to attentiveness of the staff. Had to ask for refills, etx"}
{"text":"Tried Blueberry Hill Sunday morning in Las Vegas. The outside was not that appealing compared to the flashy look of the strip only a few blocks away, it looked very country oakie. Inside, the staff was nice, the restroom needed a little tlc, and the booths were comfy (though I'm short and my feet barely touched the floor). As a group of 6, they sat us quickly, and the food came out decently quick. Everyone loved their food. Perfect for a hangover, or a desire for a home country meal. I got the biscuits and gravy, just 1 was a lot; and bacon. The biscuit was 3 something and the bacon side was over $4 (read wtf?) They need to work on their pricing. One girl got 2 biscuits,  sausage, 2 eggs, and cheese sticks.  Her bill was $24. Everything was individually charged; and the way it was set up on the menu, confusing.   For everyone else, it was a good experience."}
{"text":"Went to Blueberry after a night of boozing, and it was 3AM when we arrived.. (of course.. hello LV!) Just to start off, the food was great at Blueberry. The waitress could have been a bit more enthusiastic though... I know she probably deals with drunken people all the time, but she could care less about giving suggestions. It was kind of rude when some of us were genuinely really asking for opinion. Especially when you go, \"can I ask you a question\" and in all seriousness, her reply was , \"no\".  Who does that.  Whatever.   The Fried Chicken & Waffle was pretty delicious.. devoured that quick.  I also enjoyed their egg benedict that I shared with my friend. Simple and easy.  Pretty good for the price.  Would have been 5 stars if the lady was friendly.  I would still come back for the Fried Chicken and Waffle."}
{"text":"The breakfast was yummy. Possibly some of the best pancakes I have ever eaten. Very busy, but worth the wait."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this location and I can see why it is a favorite with Vegas locals for breakfast.  The place was packed and the smells of the food being cooked was terrific.  Definitely a mouth watering experience while waiting to be seated.   The server was very friendly and kept our glasses filled with our drinks.  I ordered biscuits and gravy with a side of bacon.  The biscuits were two of the biggest biscuits that I have seen (at home or at a restaurant), yet they were light, fluffy and very tasty.  In the end, I couldn't both of them, they were so big.  As a personal preference, I do wish the gravy was a little thicker, but that didn't detract from the taste at all.  The bacon was cooked just right, a little crispy but still juicy and not over cooked at all.   Everyone at the table agreed that their meals were very good, no complaints about the food. The seats could have been a little more comfortable and the bathrooms needed more attention, but that shouldn't dissuade anyone from enjoying a very good meal at Blueberry Hill.   I'll come back for more on my next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"I must have passed this place 200 times, but I never had the occasion to go inside. It was nice. Good service, Friendly waiters and waitresses. Everything was fine, but in my opinion, it was expensive for breakfast. $30+ for 2 people. Breakfasts diners here in Las Vegas don't differ too much from place to place.  This place was expensive relative to the other 50 places that I've been to since I've lived here. That's all."}
{"text":"While visiting my parents in Vegas over the weekend, me, my wife, my dad and mom had breakfast here. The service was OUTSTANDING and the food - oh my!  Huge portions, so tasty and fresh.  They have the BEST waffles!  From now on when I go to Vegas, I will ONLY have breakfast HERE!  I've never tried lunch or dinner but i'm sure it's amazing as well!"}
{"text":"Good portions, good tasting American breakfast foods. Coffee was good too and the cost reasonable. Only took off one star because we had to ask more than once for our missing drink and toast."}
{"text":"Service was good but a bit slow. The crepes were delicious though! Along with the berry compote it was the perfect breakfast meal accompanied by a side of bacon and scrambled eggs. Perfect for a family on a budget that wants better quality food. We will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Mostly everything made fresh in-house. My favorite so far is the Full Breakfast combo with crepes. They were flavorful and fluffy; the blueberry jam wasn't absurdly sweet and nicely balanced. Highly recommend to anyone! I will definitely be back before this trip is over."}
{"text":"Biscuits and gravy so yummy, my little ones happy face pancake gave her a happy face and a full belly. Portions are very large. I have been to all the blueberry places in town, this spot is the best. Great coffee"}
{"text":"This place lives up to its reputation as a friendly, family run restaurant. Hearty portions -- 4 egg omelettes folks!! -- easily made one breakfast into two. Super fluffy pancakes on the side adds to all the reasons this place is rated like it is."}
{"text":"You've gotta get breakfast here! THE BEST PANCAKES my husband and I have ever had!! We will bring family and friends here when they come out to visit. We'll be back...many times"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast before going to the movies and the service was great as well as our food was hot and fresh & there was a lot so, I had to take home 1/2 of my food but, leftovers are always great!! I can't wait to come back here for lunch or dinner next time"}
{"text":"I visited this restaurants a couple of weeks ago on a Sunday. I ordered a breakfast burrito and was GREATLY disappointed. it looked like it had been slopped together. The scrambled egg was overly raw and it was topped off with a tomato sauce that tasted like pizza topping tomato sauce. It was accompanied by rice and beans: the rice was cold and the beans were extremely dry (cracked beans). I was unable to finish my meal and later that evening had a huge stomach ache. It was a huge gastronomical mistake. I don't recommend this restaurant under ANY conditions."}
{"text":"While in Vegas you must eat, and if your a coffee shop fanatic then don't miss this gem.  The coffee shop feel is very real. It kind of warms your heart and makes you feel all kinds of calm.  My server was very friendly but a little forgetful, keep in my it was about 7 ish on a weekday and only a handful of tables.  Never forget to set your silver wear before you walk away, I will be needing something to stir my coffee with.  Nice menu, not too busy. I got two plates because I could t decide and I'm still growing ;)  Biscuits & gravy, pancakes, coffee, happy, leave me alone.  Well..done sir.  I will be recommending this restaurant and may come back for another meal if I'm ever in Hell, I mean Vegas again."}
{"text":"After today's lunch I gotta bump up my rating ... Had the Monday special (country chicken w/dressing) included a drink, soup or salad and dessert for about 10 bucks... A great value.   The highlights... Chicken had awesome flavor.  Gravy tasted great  Coffee was great Blueberry pie was amazingly good!  The cons... Chicken was dry..thank god there was gravy The dressing was too moist Cornbread was adequate.   My recommendation... Scout the large menu and choose from homemade items and specials. I think that's the best bet to be pleased here.   I'll be back."}
{"text":"I am from out of town so I went with some friends the place was very bust we had good service and the food was good I admired the coffee cups and asked the waitress if they seel them she said yes at the cashier I said ok thank you. When I go to pay the bill I asked the cashier if I could purchase 2 of the coffee cups she said I would have to go find a waitress that is not busy to write up the order I said ok then she said I would have to go to the back of the line and pay for them I said don't I pay you and she said yes but they are busy so I have to go behind everyone else now if I want to do this I said forget it payed my bill and left. The food was good but the cashier very rude"}
{"text":"I arrived and parked with ease.  Unloaded the wife and kids and went inside where we were seated immediately.  We were sat at a corner booth which didn't work to well with a car seat, but we made it work.  Drinks were served promptly, but it took a while for them to take our order.  20 minutes later the food arrived.  Overall the food quality was pretty good.  But I believe that need to work on the service a bit."}
{"text":"Four stars alone just for having healthy choice options on the menu! I always hit up this family style diner after a workout at Gold's across the street.  Egg whites, grilled chicken, whole grain toast, fruit plate is a perfect after workout meal. Menu here is huge! I miss it already back here in NY."}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp, my husband and I had an awesome afternoon breakfast! After a Vegas night, we didn't wake up until 11:30. Being able to eat a HUGE, delicious stack of pancakes after a night of...well...it's not important what the night was made of. However, suffice it to say, the food was delicious, the coffee continuous, and the portions out of control!  When we're back in Vegas, we'll definitely be back to Blueberry Hill! Next time, I'm getting one of those HUMONGOUS pieces of cake!"}
{"text":"Food was overcooked on most of our orders. Had to ask for gravy 5 or 6 times and the waitress acted like it was a super inconvenience to help us. Several other tables in our section complained about the service."}
{"text":"Whenever we're in town, we return to one of the spots it all began over a decade ago......  Good food across the breakfast menu.... In 4 non buffet breakfast trips away from the Strip... this is the spot...."}
{"text":"I've been to all the Blueberry Hill restaurants in town even the long time gone great one in Henderson. This one is the best, you can expect great service and great diner food.  The atmosphere is classic diner with the requisite oldies playing in the background. I've had a variety of their omelettes (always plump, fluffy, and never over cooked), chicken fried steak and eggs, Tennessee fried steak, chorizo and eggs and their amazing fluffy pancakes. Today I had a craving for their Tito Bandito Plate, steak and eggs smothered in cheese onions and salsa. It comes with beans, rice, thick homemade chips, tortillas, pico, sour cream and shredded lettuce to make tacos. The steak is tasty, hearty, but a little chewy unless you cut it across the grain. The beans are refried but fresh not heavy or pasty, an excellent combination plate. It doesn't normally come with pancakes but I ordered them anyway because they are the best in town. Fluffy mounds of weight gain.   The service is super attentive, they are constantly checking on you regardless of the crowd demands, and they are personable and friendly at all times."}
{"text":"French Toast is amazing! My wife & I always compare every other places french toast to this one but it just doesnt stack up lol! Can't wait to be in Vegas so i can visit again!"}
{"text":"Wow definitely a great breakfast spot, I had the Irish hollandaise breaky with fruit and a added side of potatoes with a coffee and walked out paying something like $15 ! The food was very tasty and the service was fast/friendly I would suggest however getting early or booking a head as it was crazy busy. I came by myself so there was no line to eat at the counter. When ever I want a good breakfast or cheap dinner I'll be back !"}
{"text":"What a shame. This place was supposed to be my substitute for the Anchor Grill in Covington, KY. I have been having some serious good ol' fashioned greasy spoon withdrawl since I moved to Vegas, over two years ago. So, Blueberry Hill it is, but only when I absolutely HAVE to.  The seating's not comfortable, but that's to be expected of a diner. The service is less than desireable, but that's expected as well. The food ... eh. I ordered a plate of ham 'n eggs, home fries, and wheat toast. I received a plate of, certainly, ham 'n eggs, but of the variety with the grill still stuck to them. The potatoes were dark and dry, and the toast resembled a kitchen sponge left to dry on the counter for a couple weeks. Had this been served to me after a long night at Zodie's, then I probably wouldn't have known the difference. Or cared. I would have dove in, face first, heartily and happily. But no one likes to start the day with a bad taste in their mouth and indigestion. It certainly wasn't worth nearly six of MY dollars. Next time, I'll stick to their pancakes. Or a waffle. How hard is it to ruin one of those?  There is something silly and wacky about Blueberry Hill that should be mentioned. They have a bell that sounds every so often, and when it does, the entire staff stops what their doing to wash their hands.  I forgot to mention the gamblin' machines in the front lobby. Ah, Vegas -- omlettes, hashbrowns, and video poker, oh my!"}
{"text":"Pancakes are the best I've ever had. I went with my personal favorite - chocolate chip & shared them along with a corned beef omelette."}
{"text":"A great place to grab a bite after a long night of drinking, or if you're just getting off of work. The menu is enormous and the selection is probably hands down the best in Vegas. Lots of choices and they pretty much have any combination of anything you could want. The portion sizes are huge so come with your appetite.   Prices are high like anywhere in Vegas and last I checked $14 for an omelette is high. They will overwhelm you with quantity not necessarily quality. It's good don't get me wrong but it's not mind blowing, nor should it be. It's a great little place that isn't Denny's or Village Inn. Give it a shot and see."}
{"text":"Blubbery Hill is set up very similar to Denny's and IHOP with their own twist on breakfast and non-breakfast items, only better! I had the honey coconut chicken and waffles with a side of poached eggs and it was delicious. My dad had the Eggs Benedict Florentine and that too was excellent especially with the extra crispy hash browns. There are too many tasty things to try, and so little time.  The restaurant is spacious and the wait staff is super friendly. They also serve breakfast lunch and dinner all day long. I'd definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I love this place!   This is the classic American diner that we all look for. It's a family owned chain of about 4 I think, I choose to go to this one even though it was a little further out because it wasn't 24 hours.   All items on the menu are great portions and qulaity food, they advertise on their site that they use fresh OJ, bacon and ham from Oscar mayer, etc. You can actually tatse the difference compatred to a Denny's or IHOP.   4 stars because they are little pricier than other diners but still cheap overall,so more like 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"We love Blueberry and have been going there for years.  It's a must when in Vegas.  Our faves are the cinnamon swirl pancakes, potato pancakes and the ham/cheese omelet.  Service is usually good although this last time we ordered our omelet with american and got cheddar.  We shoulda sent it back but didn't- had to return to get it right :)"}
{"text":"We've been going to BBH for a loooong time and have always loved it.  We are diner, comfort food kinda people and they've got it here.  I usually get the stuffed french toast and my hubby gets the potato pancakes.  They had a $4.99 special for cinnamon swirl pancakes so I decided to give them a try.    OMG!!!  They were amazing!  They had a crunchy cinnamon crust on top and were soft and tender inside.  Seriously, the most delicious pancakes I have ever had.  I got 4 huge pancakes and could only eat 1 1/2 so had some yummy left overs although the cinnamon crust softened.  My hubby loved them, too.  His potato pancakes were flavorful so overall we were two happy campers.  Always, BBH is a must when in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Honestly best breakfast! Inexpensive as well! I ordered the eggs Benedict and my husband had the green salsa chilaquiles!!! We sat by the cooking station and they were fast and clean! We were seated quickly even though it was a busy Saturday morning and we got our food fast! The service was great as well!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh I haven't been to this restaurant in so long. It's a little out of my way, I actually forgot how great it is. The omelette was outstanding, not greasy, so fresh! Our waitress was adorable and very efficient. Pancakes were outstanding ! Yum!!!   Update: Isn't it funny how the chef makes all the difference? I visited this location again and order the same identical item, it was so greasy that I did not even need it. I will say the manager, Juan, Took care of it immediately and took it off my check. Be sure you always tell the manager so they know what's going on and they don't continue to let the chef serve the substandard dish."}
{"text":"Their Apple Crepes are EVERYTHING. That is all. I usually get the Crepe Dealer and it's worth every penny.  Since in new here and have eaten many places on various occasions while only Visiting Vegas, this has to be my favorite. So, this will be my new \"jam\"... PLUS the service is always stellar. I absolutely I love it!"}
{"text":"We were on this side of town this evening and thought we'd try something new. The reviews seemed good so we decided to try it out.   We almost turned around once we got to the parking lot, run down, sketchy, ect. But figured we'd try it anyways. Once inside I wasn't expecting a lot. And overall the food was OK. It wasn't anything special at all but it didn't taste bad.   The service though was awful. Very rarely do I care too much about how personable my server is or isn't, as long as they do their job, whatever. But she was rude and didn't do her job. She needs to find a new career choice. The manager that cashed us out was equally as rude. It was really mind boggling these people are working in customer service.   Also. How a grilled cheese, hamburger and two .99 kid meals equal up to $37 makes no sense to me. We pay that much for the 4 of us at a much better tasting restaurant with a nicer staff"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.  I've been eating here since high school 20 years ago.    I've tried pretty much everything here.  The breakfast is decent but those pancake are phenomenal.  But after having the Italian Meatloaf a few years back I don't order anything else.  My girl and I sometimes go there to share an Alaskan Waffle!!!"}
{"text":"This is an old time plastic menu breakfast place by my parents house.  Looks like ypour typical IHOP. Trusted by fellow yelpers on this one. The pancakes were the star. Made from scratch and very good. Portion size for a short stack could feed two, no problem. Hadn't had this type of food in a long time. Kept me full and satisfied all day."}
{"text":"I had their Roast Turkey dinner..everything on point except the dressing was a little bit too salty..dinner salad was great..just right.  Their desert a 5 star on its own!  Wow.. Service was extremely good..courteous..friendly and warm!"}
{"text":"A comfortable nice family diner. It's far from an upscale place or anything (they could use some renovation). I recommend coming here to enjoy a 24 hour breakfast (they are open 24/7) and breakfast is what they do best.   The portions are large and the price is reasonable. Best way I can describe this place is like an better version of an IHOP. Service is friendly and they never seem to be overly crowded.   I think there are a few locations of this family owned restaurant. This location is right by UNLV and the Flamingo Library. The neighborhood is kinda sketchy so just be careful."}
{"text":"Great little diner with good breakfast. Pancakes were off the hook and took up the whole plate. Coffee cups were huge and toast was as thick as french toast. Overall very good spot that is mostly filled with locals. Only reason I gave 4 stars is because the booths are a little snug."}
{"text":"Server was beyond wonderful. The food on the other hand was just okay. Everything was greasy, the country potatoes weren't crispy, the florentine was okay, but the muffin under came out already soggy - I wasn't super satisfied with what I ordered but maybe the other breakfast items are better!"}
{"text":"Bring an extra gut with you... you gonna need it. I had the chorizo omelette (4 eggs) quite tasty and large. Ask for extra salsa. My traveling partner who usually eats a lot could not finish his food and then he bitched all day about how full he was... The staff was very nice and kept us full up on coffee..."}
{"text":"Food was great!   Just what I was looking for. Service was spot on and the staff was very nice and friendly!"}
{"text":"\"Waitress Special\" YUM!!, read about it on a previous review. It was lovely, went on a Thursday morning no wait, food great. Waffle I'll dream about. Got bacon and scrambled eggs as well, crispy bacon. Hubby had steak and eggs he loved that too got his steak rare for him. Service good and pretty quick too. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"always has kind and accomodating staff. never stingy on portions, unlike the location around decatur and charleston. always worth the walk from UNLV. I've been here 3 times and have ordered something different each time. never disappointed in the very least. but, they need to invest in a cleaner bathroom. it looks really old with mold/deposit/etc buildup"}
{"text":"food was amazing, but the service...NOT sure...The server wasn't paying attention to what we want and came back with my order correct, but my man's order was all WRONG so he had to wait 2x as they couldn't get it right...no bueno"}
{"text":"It's ok.. French toast good, omelette was lacking ... Looked like a scramble instead of an actual omelette... Wondering where my shreds is at 'cause I'd like to taste it.."}
{"text":"Came in Saturday morning with a group of friends. There was a wait but we lucked out by sitting on the counter which was first come first serve. I had walked in by myself as friends were in parking lot and saved the counter space. as another couple tried to sit there the manager notified them that we were there first. I was glad he did that as he saved us from having to wait! The server attending the counter was quick and very attentive. The food was also really Good and reasonably priced. I had the Denver omelette and my friend had the chilaquiles which all really enjoyed. Will definitely be back on our next Vegas trip!"}
{"text":"This 24-hr joint always seems to keep busy. Las Vegans are the true fans and there are reasons for that.     It never closes, it's affordable, pretty good quality, and their food is made in house. Their menu is like a book offering Italian, Mexican, Greek and American cuisine.  I grew up surrounded by diners.  It made me feel like I was back east. Especially how they have their dinner specials plated in the front for displayed. greens wilted and gravy with a film from sitting there all day. but i think it's deserves every bit of 4 stars. It's not EXTREMELY scrumptious but it's also not disappointing. It's a diner. I hear their dessert are tasty too."}
{"text":"This place is tucked away off of the main strip in Vegas.  Upon entering there was a line of people. The host informed us that there was no wait at the bar area. We sat down and were greeted almost immediately. Our server was friendly and attentive. At first I thought about getting my own meal. I'm glad I didn't! The servings are huge! I got a side of pancakes and my husband got biscuits and gravy. Hands down some of the best biscuits I've had. The pancakes were so buttery and rich. The food was filling and left me feeling like I needed a good nap afterward. They also had lots of different cakes that looked amazing.  If I wasn't so full I would have taken some to go."}
{"text":"We came here for brunch on sunday. This place is horrible, the service was very bad..the food was disgusting and cold...and the worst part was how dirty it was..from ceiling to floor..just look around and you'll see spots that haven't been cleaned in years.."}
{"text":"It could use a renovation, but you can't eat atmosphere! The food s outstanding, and we had such a good experience, we went back the second day. We even got the same server! She was on her game both days, and the food.... Oh the food. Potato Pancakes, Sausage Gravy(My wife thought that was a tad sweet, but I was digging it), HONEY COCONUT CHICKEN & WAFFLES. Try that! My wife got it and I almost ate two breakfasts it was so good. On the second day, I got Eggs Benedict on potato pancakes. Absolutely delicious. The potato pancakes are made from hash browns, unlike the mashed potato version I'm used to. They're perfectly seasoned and a good size. Eggs Benedict had Canadian bacon that was easily a half inch thick. Oh, and the rye toast is some real deli type rye! Not the skinny piece of flavorless rye you get at a lot of breakfast spots. Check this place out if you're a foodie."}
{"text":"My dad and I go here every Sunday and we are always extremely happy with the food and service. They have such a wide variety of options on their menu and almost anyone can find something they'd enjoy. 100% recommend for top-notch breakfast food."}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever had at a restaurant,  order was made clear and was Incorrect. Food had to be sent back.  Could tell fruit had sitten out all day. Waitress was rude acted like we were a burden from as she took our order on. Used to be one of my favorite breakfast joints in town.  Will not be going back."}
{"text":"This place is horrible I've tried it three times and all three it's been bad... the breakfast is horrible my blueberry pancakes only had 4 blueberries in it... my biscuits where dry... and today the monte crisco was not even edible  .. the service every time is poor rule of thumb if I order an appetizer don't bring it out with me entree  .. I will never go back and suggest you don't waste your money here"}
{"text":"Food was good. I never had crepes so I wanted to try them. They were good but I'm not a fan of the cheese that they stuff them with.   The worst thing about our first visit was we were seated by the bathrooms. I will take the blame as I should have said when they were seating us that we would just sit at the bar. The place was very busy and they had the other side closed. I really don't appreciate being sat by the bathroom in any restaurant.  We will go back and give it another go. :)"}
{"text":"This restaurant just opened. I think they need some more training to do. The customer service was good and the food was good. But the simplest things like ordering our drinks, having to ask for syrup and not checking on us are minor things that needs to be fixed."}
{"text":"Good service.Coffee hot.Had the breakfast burrito.Was ok.Beans were a little dry.Rice was ok.Wife had the American Chilaquiles.Was scrambled egg whites on top of tortiila chips.No flavor.Would go back but we would order something else."}
{"text":"It's was a great breakfast after spending the night in Vegas!  Great selections on the menu, with items and combinations that are unique to the establishment.  Had the pancakes and coffee, the pancakes were so delicious and made me so happy! This place does get a little crowded, so FYI.  One more thing, try the biscuits!"}
{"text":"This place has standard breakfast offerings like most joints (bacon, egg, sausage, etc.) But where they excel is the pancakes. Whether you like good ol' fashion or with fruit.... They have the best pancakes. I was actually mad that I wasted my appetite on other breakfast standards. They has have crazy exotic pancakes for the fatty/depressed at heart so go nuts and get some oreos on it! I left off one star b/c service was not that good. Our server left us hanging on refills and took forever to get things to us when we asked and we had to get other servers"}
{"text":"i have been going here for years and the only thing that has changed is me! i adore this small chain and make sure i stop in EVERY trip to lv!"}
{"text":"Items selected:  Coffee  Chocolate Oreo Pancakes - Four pancakes cooked with our 40 year old special recipe chocolate buttermilk pancake batter with gobs of real crumbled Oreo cookies cooked right in the batter, then topped with our homemade vanilla icing. Finished with more crumbled Oreo cookies sprinkled on top of the pancakes  Blueberry Hill Style Monte Cristo Sandwich - Turkey and ham smothered with Swiss cheese, grilled on our own French toast bread with Strawberry Compote  Red Velvet Cake  Contrary to the opinions of some, as much as I enjoy fine dining I share equal passion for dining experiences many gourmands would consider 'low brow,' particularly at breakfast, and taking this fact into account it was with much enthusiasm that I finally visited locally grown 24/7 staple Blueberry Hill just prior to 6am Saturday morning.  Situated on Decatur and the largest of a handful of locations spanning the city the look and feel of the restaurant can best be summed up as an upscaled Denny's with better coffee alongside a more creative menu and given my early hour of arrival the service was exemplary - an older couple entering just after me the restaurant's only other patrons.  A skeleton crew in the kitchen largely focused on preparing the day's housemade cakes and pastries it was with little delay that decisions were made from the extensive menu and orders placed I chatted with my waitress at length, the longtime veteran of Blueberry Hill keeping coffee filled to the brim and commending my picks while offering suggestions for 'next time' - an occurrence that will be sooner rather than later given the quality of what soon arrived.  Beginning savory and moving to sweet it was with a loaded un-fried Monte Cristo that I began and deferring standard jam with a request for the housemade strawberry compote I'd strongly recommend everyone do the same as the ample sweetness proved a lovely balance to briny ham and smoked turkey...\"balance\" completely ignored by my second selection, the pillow soft pancakes chock-a-block full of crushed cookies and smeared with frosting identical in flavor to the cream-filling, plus whipped cream for garnish.  Sated and heavily caffeinated it was perhaps a bit gluttonous to consider dessert but unable to pass on a rotating cake-case it was with a slice of Red Velvet that I made my departure and waiting until the afternoon to indulge the results were good, if not great, as the cake was moist and rich though I'd have preferred more tang to the icing...a small quibble at $3 for the 11.6oz 'slice.'"}
{"text":"Maria our server this afternoon is an absolute pleasure! Attentive and always had a smile on her face!"}
{"text":"Now this location is closer and for you 'drinkers' out there, it has a bar one can sit at!  Always a regular- yes, I have my mugs! I enjoy the soups, which are different on a daily basis. I typically crave their tuna melt, but not with American cheese. May I suggest trying it with Swiss or Mozzarella cheese:) Maria is my favorite waitress at this location. open 24 hours and breakfast is served all day! Save some room if you have a sweet tooth please.  My favorite is the chocolate cream or coconut cream pie. This place is as close as I am to a diner (I'm from L.I. And well, I'm hoping the menu will one day state: 'disco fries'.  For now, I specify my detailed French fry order;)"}
{"text":"Maybe I hit the place on an off day based on the reviews but our food wasn't very good at all. Hash browns were good, but the steak omelette I ordered was so over cooked and dry that I couldn't stomach it. Same with the pancakes...no amount of syrup could cover up the dryness."}
{"text":"Stopped here for breakfast because they have the best chicken and waffles anywhere. My wife and I shared the coconut honey chicken and waffle and my daughter had the 3 crepe meal with blueberry compote.  The honey butter that comes with the chicken and waffles is so good that syrup isnt even needed. In fact it might detract from the brilliant flavor they have on their own.  My daughter loved the crepes and I basically stole one off her plate.   The relatively low amount of food we ordered was plenty to keep us full all day long. This is a must stop for basically anything you'd like to eat."}
{"text":"Chicken noodle soup is the BOMB. We were sick, like throwing up for days sick, so it was something good to eat that stayed down. And like the BEST chicken noodle soup I've ever had.   Service was great; waitress was really nice.   The walls are purple and remind you of blueberry stains on your pancakes. :)   I also got crepes; they were aight. Maybe I'm just more of a fan of savory crepes.   I'll be back to try more stuff soon!"}
{"text":"OMG!!  We stopped here for breakfast out last day in Vegas.  It's probably a good thing it was our last day, or I'm pretty sure we would have eaten every meal here...everyday!  It was that good!  It was homestyle cooking at its greatest!  My husband had the bisquits and gravy, and I had the crepes!  Talk about amazing.  I don't even have words that can adequately describe how good it was!  This place may be the only reason I'd ever go back to Vegas.  When traveling, eating out can get old, but this place felt like you went to grandmas for breakfast.  I'm sure lunch and dinner were equally good!  Definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"First time here after hearing about this place for years. Was not disappointed. The extensive menu has some awesome choices, not just for breakfast.  I had a hot apple and chicken n waffles and it was Fantastic! Coffee was fine too."}
{"text":"Good food. good service. Standard diner. Nothing outstanding.  It's the little things that bugged me. Spends, my sweetener of choice, was not on the table, I had to ask for it. The BLT I had was good, but seemed to be assembled rather quickly and fell apart as I was picking it up."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for breakfast dine ins. I love their giant menu, and everything on their menu is delicious. Blows ihop out of the water."}
{"text":"Its a nice place to go with friends and family. But, this place needs a big clean up. Sometimes, tables feel sticky..."}
{"text":"This place was okay. It is definitely a hangover-cure kind of place: huge portions of down-home, calorie-laden fare. Here's what we had, with commentary:   One thing that really makes a place like this for me is good, strong coffee. Unfortunately the coffee here was watery.   -pigs in a blanket: frou-frou sausages designed by some SF chef wrapped in pancakes, sprinkled liberally with powdered sugar and served with maple syrup. Pretty good. I could swear that the pancakes had some cornmeal in them? They had this odd combination of tasting pleasantly of corn, but also being very, very fluffy.  -omelet. denver, i think. My husband said it was just ok. It looked really, really greasy. It came with pancakes.   -chocolate layer cake: dry. Not very tasty.  The bathrooms were very clean."}
{"text":"Only not 5 stars because it's a little outdated and worn on the inside, but the food is true dive diner food. We've never had a problem with any of our choices, and my kids love eating waffles and pancakes for dinner."}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for breakfast then look no further.  This place is very similar to Denny's but 10 times better with a lot more options.  The portions are large so if you are really hungry then this is the place for you.  Both of my kids loved it and if we are back in the area we will definitely eat here."}
{"text":"Had the Waitress Special, a waffle with eggs and bacon. It was really good and definitely a reasonably priced place to have breakfast in Vegas."}
{"text":"Always a must stop when we come to Vegas. Especially when we need a good breakfast to pick us up from the night before or to get us going for the day ahead. Prices are about $15-$20 per person with drink but considering portions are bigger than normal, I don't might the prices at all. Next time you're in Vegas make a quick stop and prove me wrong... I dare you. Sorry no pics today because I ate everything before I thought about taking any pics. ENJOY!"}
{"text":"Way better than an ihop or Denny's. Will drive further to go to a blueberry hill restaurant before stopping at another spot."}
{"text":"I've been to 3 or 4 Blueberry Hill restaurants in Vegas and all of them are really good. Even the ones that look like they're run down holes still serve up great food. You would think that anything more than eggs, pancakes or a burger would be a bad choice but I've ordered a bunch of different things and they've all been better than expected. It's one of my safe, go-to places to eat when I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast. I ordered the heuvos rancheros which came out blazingly fast, and were pretty tasty, with an appropriate level of spiciness. The jalepeno on the side was nice. Service from my waitress, Nicole, was good. Besides bringing my food out quickly, she was also on top of regular coffee refills.   I would return."}
{"text":"Hands down the best breakfast we had on our Vegas trip. Great options, great portions and great service. Off the strip but worth the drive. Must go!!"}
{"text":"Wow... i think i may have just had the best pancakes i've ever tasted. Holy cow they were awesome. Pigs in the blanket all the way ;)"}
{"text":"Good service!! First time here and I enjoyed the breakfast we ordered coconut chicken waffles and hashbrown omellete with toast and hashbrowns and a coffee for $26.16 The portion size is huge we had to take to go. Would recommend this place to everyone!!"}
{"text":"Great basic family restaurant. Fast service great breakfast menu. Huge selection of pancakes and waffles. Very casual."}
{"text":"This is one if our favorite places for breAkfast before we go home.  The lunch is really good and the french fries are excellent.  Crispy outside and soft inside.   The special on the board was pork chops and it was delicious and we saved 2.00. I split this and gut a side if pancakes.  It was perfect amount if food.  The place us not the cleanest but it works for breakfast.  The philly steak was 5 stars."}
{"text":"The arrive was good here.  The meatloaf biscuits was yummy yum.  I like the combination they put in the meatloaf.  There was alot of flavors in my mouth. It was salty but I like it that way.  The pork gravy was good I wish I had more.  Didn't want to pay 1.99 for a side of gravy.  The pancakes were so fluffy and perfect.  The egg with ham and potatoes were just 3 stars meh.   Chicken fried chicken was yummy and plentiful.  The chicken was yummy and the biscuit was kind of dense but good with gravy."}
{"text":"I'm A Pretty Particular Guy with a Very Discerning Palette. The Breakfast Here is Off the Chain! The Best Breakfast Place off the Strip and Great Portions and the Service is Phenomenal!!!"}
{"text":"From the outside of this place I didn't think it would be anything more than blah. It looked liked Vegas' version of IHOP. The inside had plates on display that looked like a diner at 3am. Boy was I wrong!! This place was soo good! I had the meatlovers skillet and my husband had some kind of meatloaf breakfast sandwich deliciousness. Do not let the outside trick you into thinking it is some bland place. Give it a try the portions are graet for the price and the service was soo prompt! I will recommend to get the fluffy pancakes instead of the english muffin (I made the wrong choice and deeply regretted it)."}
{"text":"If you're visiting Las Vegas, this is the last place you're likely to find yourself. It's your standard issue pancake house -- IHoP, Golden Nugget, what have you. There are 7 Blueberry Hills listed on Yelp. This one is about 3 blocks from my sister's house, which is why I always end up there for at least one meal. Preferably breakfast. They do a killer blueberry pancake (as you might guess), and have a variety of gut busting specialties. (Their omelletes made with four eggs.) I was disappointed in the Monte Cristo sandwich, which is a test for me. Clean, friendly service, inexpensive -- everything you expect from a pancake house. They have a bin by the front door to collect food and clothing for the homeless, which is a nice touch. Also a couple of video poker machines, which is standard for Vegas."}
{"text":"Quick, inexpensive, with great customer service!  I ordered a special with 5 mini blueberry pancakes, eggs, harsh browns and bacon!  They were very busy on Saturday morning but their smiley faces did not deter.  The pancake batter tastes homemade and is so yummy!!! Denny's doesnt even stand a chance with this place!!!"}
{"text":"Went there recently with a friend of mine that was here from out of town. The hostess was very attentive and sweet. The food was very good and it didn't take forever to come. It had been many years since I'd been there and I can say I am happy that I enjoyed this place again after so long."}
{"text":"I am solely writing this review on one plate that I ordered.  And that is  the alaskan waffles.  I absolutely loved it and its like a breakfast dessert that anyone can eat in anytime of the day.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone and you guys should give it a try.   It is with a medium sized waffle that is  topped with ice cream and your choice of apple or blueberry or strawberry compote. Finished with whipped cream and it was absolutely delish :)"}
{"text":"Nothing is better than breakfast after a night of club/bar hopping and drinking. Blueberry Hill has everything to suit whichever mood you are in. There is no need to settle on eggs if the craving for a burger is present. This allows for less bickering with your friends and more time to nurse that impending hangover.  Tonight, my friend and I shared an Alaskan Waffle with Apple Compote. The crispy yet fluffy waffle was layered with a thick serving of vanilla ice cream, heaps of warm apple pie filling, and a mound of whip cream. The hot waffle started to melt the ice cream, creating a wonderful sauce.   This monster is definitely something to share. At a little over $9, it can easily feed two while leaving you feel comatose.   Being so close to the university, this is definitely an old haunt that reminds me of many a drunken nights. The wait staff here know how to deal with this crowd of younger party goers."}
{"text":"The breakfast here is very good.  I usually order egg white omelettes and one time I got egg beaters which I didn't like too much.  Hence the 4 stars not 5.  I just wish they would tell people if that's only what they have or if the chef working won't do egg whites.  Even after this I still have to give it 4 stars because they have the best french toast I have ever  had in my life!  I don't even enjoy sweets, but for some reason I wanted french toast and I'm glad I ordered it.    The crust is so crispy and the middle is so soft.  It was so perfect with the little butter that was on it and the warm syrup.  Texture and Taste was unbeatable.  I really don't see how they could make it any better."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch while in Vegas for a work trip turned vacay. I am annoyed I have suffered so many overpriced yet sub standard breakfast buffets when this place was just around the corner and at a fraction of the price! This will be our go-to place from now on! While the huge menu was a bit overwhelming, we stuck with our favorites and weren't disappointed. I had the coconut chicken and waffles and it was out of this world... plus a side of what may have been the best biscuits and gravy I've ever had. I also had a few bites of the french toast, which was so flavorful I couldn't believe it. I'm looking forward to my next hungover vegas morning simply so I can pour myself into a booth with my sunglasses on and indulge in some incredible breakfast food at Blueberry Hill."}
{"text":"Every time we fly into Vegas this is our first stop..... great service great food couldn't ask for a better place to start our vacation!!!"}
{"text":"Very extensive menu and I'm not sure how they keep it up. It was hard to decide what to have for breakfast. I ended up having the chefs special which was one piece of French toast two eggs and two pieces of crisp bacon. It was wonderful! My husband had the Mexican breakfast and it was also really good. His portion was absolutely huge. This is a family style diner. It was very good and the service was great!"}
{"text":"Food was awesome the service was excellent and the pricing was great. Catch a cab to visit this spot. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"The food was really yummy. And the vintage decor was cute. The only things I would love for old diners to change are: to not use Heinz or Smuckers or any other mass brand of \"food\" item that has high fructose corn syrup or hydrogenated oils in them. Get real quality foods: real maple syrup, real butter, real half & half instead of weird fake coffee creamers, real peanut butter, real honey, ketchup without high fructose corn syrup, real salad dressings, etc. Well, I think I've made my point. Otherwise I really enjoyed the food at this old school diner."}
{"text":"This place is delicious if you love breakfast like I do! Giant pancakes, buttery eggs, great bacon. I haven't tried the non breakfast food, but I'm sure it's just as great."}
{"text":"I went to Blueberry Hill last Friday and even though it's one of my favorite breakfast places I can't seem to go back. I was sitting at the counter when a giant cock roach came crawling across the counter. That just makes me sick! Also, I'm not against religion but I am against business forcing their beliefs on others. Lose the religious books for sale at the cash register. Looks like I'll have to find a new favorite."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp, so my husband and I decided to try it out for breakfast. It was really good! The service was good, as soon as we sat down they brought us our coffee, which by the way was really good. The food was delicious and they give you big portions, I didnt finish my breakfast and neither did my husband & he eats a lot. The price was decent and the waitress kept checking on us which was great! If you're looking for a breakfast place this is it!"}
{"text":"Good food..skillet was good..my kids enjoyed the omelettes...the waitress, Leslie, was very nice...oh..and no picture available..we finished everything"}
{"text":"Amazing food & good service! Great people watching too!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast!!! Food was great.  Service was very friendly. I had the ham and cheese omelette, which was great.  Customized it with no hassles at all. My wife had the fresh fruit crepes.  Her only issue was the apples being too crisp.   Would have been five, but it was to cold for my wife without a sweatshirt.  We would definitely go again though!"}
{"text":"Good food, great service, open 24hours, and prices are great.  I don't think I've come here yet and been disappointed.    Today, I had the old fashion buttermilk pancakes.  They are huge, fluffy and served hot, the butter melts quickly and runs down the side.  I smother them in sryup and take my first bite.  It's everything I can imagine.  The flavors remind me of my mom's!  No kidding.  Every Sunday, we would get pancakes, and back in the day, they were made from scratch, and these were just as good.    Great breakfast, worth a trip and you know, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"After three days of overpriced, so-so breakfasts at the casinos, this place was EXACTLY what we wanted!  Big portions, cheap and awesome!  The pancakes were big and fluffy and the biscuits and gravy were amazing!  I wished I had room to try a piece of the cake or pie in the display case - seriously, if they do biscuits that good, what must their desserts be like?!  Next time, I guess.  Because I WILL be back the next time I am in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Great place to come for breakfast or lunch. Margarita is an amazing waitress. She maked sure I was attended. I would definitely recommend it and i will come back just to get spoiled by Margarita!!!"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant!  My boyfriend and I have been here a handful of times for breakfast, and we always leave feeling super satisfied. Their portions are large and their staff is extremely friendly. It can get really busy sometimes, so it is best to come either before or after the normal breakfast or lunch crowd gets there."}
{"text":"We're party of 8, and they removed the glass that split two booths, so we could fit comfortably.   Our waitress greeted us with a smile and said welcome to Blueberry Hill. The menu has breakfast and dinner options. We were able to order lunch at breakfast.   Their blueberry muffins and whipped butter was delicious.   They have large slices of pie and cakes."}
{"text":"Order the chilaquiles really good flavor the salsa verde really spicy it made sweat but it was worth it"}
{"text":"Forget IHOP or Dennys this is the place to go ! Big variety and everything available 24/7."}
{"text":"I recently went here for breakfast, and it was great!  My guy and I were seated quickly, and before you knew it, our server was at our table getting our drink order.  I had the blueberry pancakes... awesome! The pancakes were light and fluffy, flavor was amazing! Lots of blueberries on top, and of course whipped cream. If you come to this restaurant for breakfast, make sure that you come hungry! Portions are huge, and if you wanted to can easily be shared between two people.   Everything was great, and I will be definately coming back!"}
{"text":"We came to this place because a friend who is with us was raving about how good this chain is. We sat down and after looking at the menu I was impressed with the selection and how tasty everything looked. The food came and it was mostly decent. There were a few problems such as finding spinach in one friends omelet (after she told them she was allergic), and some rotten & unwashed grapes in the fruit side. We managed to get through most of the meal and were fairly content. That is until each of the four of us began heading to the restroom with our stomachs churning before we could even leave. The food went right through each of us in a bad way taking away any previous good thoughts I had of the place. The only thing we each had were eggs so I'm guessing that might be the culprit. But after seeing the carelessness of the food we were served I think its safe to say they aren't following strict habits of cleanliness in this restaurant.   I'm only giving this place the one star cause I think it has potential with that menu. But I'd honestly tell everyone to go some place else where you don't have a horrible urge to remove what you just ate from your system shortly after eating it."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here with my family before returning to Maui. Everything was awesome! The French toast is soooooo yummy. Definitely a must have. Thank you for a wonderful dining experience. I can't wait to come here again soon :)"}
{"text":"Not much positive to say about this place. I ordered eggs over easy, crispy hash browns, and patty sausage. Eggs were done correctly, hash browns were pretty much white, and the patty was a 2 on a scale of 10. Service was good, but over priced for the quality of the food received. Gotta say I will not go back. My rating  is 2.5 not three stars."}
{"text":"The food is amazing!!! Chicken waffles with apples was yummy. Blt with turkey and fries all was delicious. Service was also great"}
{"text":"Find your thrill at Blueberry Hill  I love this place.  Part of it is because it's a great diner / pancake house that puts IHOP to shame.  The other reason is because it primarily caters to locals.  Look around, lots of blackjack dealers and cage cashiers grab a bite here after their shifts at the casino.  Blueberry Hill's menu is extensive and includes pages of breakfast, lunch, dinner, specials, and desserts.  It's overwhelming, you have to focus.  The only meal I've had here has been breakfast.  My favorite is the \"Little Boy Blue.\"  It's two blueberry pancakes with whipped cream, two eggs, and two slices of bacon or sausage  The pancakes are made-from-scratch, old-fashioned buttermilk pancakes.  The waitresses are friendly, atmosphere informal, and the prices are a bargain.   Even if you don't win in the casino, you'll certainly be a winner at this place."}
{"text":"The last thing I need on vacation is attitude from a server. I'm? in Las Vegas for the weekend to get away from attitudes not get one when I'm paying money for a service."}
{"text":"I had two experiences here, one was breakfast and the other was lunch. OMG breakfast service and food was fantastic, healthy portions and taste were great.. Lunch experience nots so good food wasn't as good service was so so at best. I was a little let down at lunch only because a couple of weeks earlier breakfast experience was so fantastic.  So enjoy breakfast and skip lunch."}
{"text":"Just happened to be shopping at the Skechers outlet store next door and asked about a good breakfast place. The girl told us about this place. Wow! It's not glamorous but boy, oh boy, they know breakfast! The pancakes were the best I have ever had. (apparently a 40 yr old recipe) The warmed syrup was a great touch. Corned beef hash omelet was deelicious and very generous with four eggs. Coffee was perfect temp and the lovely waitress Raven kept it coming right on schedule. We stumbled upon on a gem of a breakfast joint."}
{"text":"I stopped by this diner this morning after dropping my fiancé off to work. I chose this location because of the reviews. Overall, the customer service was great. However, my omelette was extremely dry. I was hoping that the salsa would help unfortunately it didn't. My pancakes were okay. I would go back but I wouldn't order an omelette!"}
{"text":"OH MY GOD the pancakes!   Okay...I visited my home of Hawaii last year and ate at Like Like Cafe on Oahu and they had the #1 best tasting pancakes I've ever had in my life. I think this place amazingly comes in at a close #2. And I've had a lot of pancakes. They aren't dense and doughy. They are fluffy, light, airy bites of delicious. I had the blueberry pancakes as this place is called \"Blueberry\" Hill. They are so good. They threw a few cold blueberries on top that added a nice kick to the bites of warm pancakes. I got the blueberry topping on the side as sometimes it's gross and too sweet. This one was JUST right. I loved it.   The apple chicken sausage was another thing I had to try based on others' reviews, but I didn't like it. I'd get bacon. I don't know about anything else here, but the pancakes are what'd I'd get if I ever go back."}
{"text":"I just landed and was starving, didnt want to deal with the strip and expensive breakfast. Not only was this place just as expensive as a restaurant on the strip but the place was disgustinly dirty. I was waiting for a bug to jump out any moment. They have a bunch of regulars that seem to not mind the filthiness so I figure thats how they manage to stay in business. Our waiter was great and very sweet."}
{"text":"I had the experience that I'm sure a good majority of people have here in that I was recovering from being awake for two days straight taking in all of Vegas has to offer. I was visiting a friend in Vegas and he had no hesitation in choosing a spot to eat.  Upon arriving I was struck by the down-home feel to this restaurant. I ordered the Farm-Fresh Sausage Omelet and a side of 3 pancakes. It goes without saying that these were the 3rd best pancakes I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE. I say 3rd, because there are better pancakes in this country but I truly believe they have the best ones in Vegas. For insight into who has even better ones check out the rest of my reviews! Overall, a great experience and a wonderful place for recovery. Don't even consider Denny's!"}
{"text":"Probably the best blueberry pancake I've ever had!! Nothing special about the decor, my eggs Benedict hash was really good comport food. Coffee was eh, diner so I guess what can you expect.  All in all a great experience and I will be back."}
{"text":"Great diner atmosphere and the friendly service you could get. Our food was quick and tasty and the portions were extreme. Perfect stop for my travels through Nevada I'll hit it again."}
{"text":"Delicious all around!!! Oh man could not finish my food. Way too much but so good. The pancakes here are bar none. Man I was already done and barely got to the omelet. Both were delicious but the pancakes got me. It's made with a lot of butter. My friends Meatloaf he gave 8 out of 10. My friend said the meat lover was 5 or 6 out of 10. We had our thrill at Blueberry Hill. Our waitress Margarita was top notch. Friendly and always with a smile."}
{"text":"Blueberry Hill is a Las Vegas staple and for good reason. Open 24 hours a day, you can always find great food served in giant sized portions. Although there are several locations across the valley, I have always preferred the one on Decatur for two reasons: it was close to my house and I liked the wait staff, especially after stumbling in at 2AM after a night of revelry on the Strip. Although they serve breakfast, lunch and dinner, in my opinion it is the breakfast dishes that steal the show.   For those hankering a carb overload, try the Stuffed French Toast or the Butter Cream Waffles. Cream cheese, whipped cream, fresh fruit, powdered sugar....sheer bliss! If you like your breakfast hot and spicy, the Chorizo Omelet will should do nicely. Don't expect any sides with this baby, it's made with 4 eggs and is stuffed to the gills with chorizo, peppers, onions cheese, rice, beans and the kitchen sink if you want.  Although the prices have increased a bit over the past few years, you will be hard pressed to find a place that can match the quality, serving size or quick and efficient service that is found at Blueberry Hill.  FYI - If you are planning on going with the fam or friends on a Sunday morning, get there early or be prepared to wait awhile. And yes, people WILL wait......."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to breakfast as this place came highly recommended! It didn't disappoint! Lets start with the biscuits and gravy...simply delicious. The pancakes were melt in your mouth divine and the coffee keeps on coming. Will definitely be back for seconds!"}
{"text":"My mom flies in and it's 1 in the morning, and what does she want to do? EAT! We end up at this location.   I was pleasantly surprised how clean it was in there versus what I was picturing because of the side of town it is at. We were immediately greeted by a genuinely friendly waitress (wish I got her name) then seated. All the menus and specials are already on the table for you to dive into.  They have a large menu...I mean, it's pretty extensive. If you know what you want, stick to it...once you start flipping through those pages persuasion kicks in resulting in indecisiveness. Well, that's what happen to me. Out of everything on that dang novel I opted for a chicken Caesar wrap. Surprise-Surprise! I was just torn because by this time it's nearly 130 in the morning and I didn't want to eat anything seriously that early/late. The wrap itself twas pretty decent. I had no idea they put onions in theirs. Felt a little bummed to bite into my wrap with the taste of onions (love onions just not in my Caesar anything).  The husband ordered their honey coconut chicken and waffles. He saw the words honey and coconut--done. He enjoyed it as the boneless chicken was moist.   The mother ordered...I wasn't paying attention. Lol. But I did see some kielbasa like sausages on her plate, toast, eggs, and hash browns. The hash browns were probably a little.on the crappy side. But I say that because I like my hash brown to have a crispy top. Geez, I must've paid alot more attention to it that I originally thought.  Overall, I was impressed at the service, facility, and the food. I guess I had pretty low expectations. The service was definitely exceptional. Our waitress wasn't acting sluggish or giving you that geez I just wanna sleep body language. She clearly had her cup of coffee and genuinely felt happy to be at work. Not a common vibe you get from workers out in the valley.   If you want something waaaay better than a Dennys or an Ihop, this place is certainly the spot to give a try.  Definitely kid and stroller friendly!"}
{"text":"This location used to be my favorite place to stop in anytime of day or night for good food and great service... I guess the staff this morning was having a bad day. Upon walking in the staff rolled their eyes and took their time seating us; with only five other people dining in the restaurant, the coffee cups and saucers were stuck to the tables (literally), the waitress was getting upset because my children and I were still deciding on our meals when SHE wanted us to order, she brought us half of our food and the other about 20 minutes later, we had to keep asking for refills on our drinks and much much more... This was a horrible experience!"}
{"text":"So after leaving the Bellagio with my sister our newly pedicured toes, the boy decided he was hungry and needed to eat something.  We asked my sister to suggest something \"diner-y, but not Denny's or IHOP.\"  We ended up at Blueberry Hill.  There was a short wait for a table, but not too bad for a Sunday morning.  Our waitress was nice, but had a beer gut and looked like she hadn't showered recently.  The restaurant had a desert motif, which I thought was kind of strange.  I mean, sure, we're in the desert but the last thing I equate with the desert is blueberries.  Blueberries grow in cool moist places.  Not in places where your flesh will boil right off your body if you stand in the sun too long.  Anyway.  The bathroom was a little run down but still use-able.  Mixed reviews on the food.  My hash browns tasted sort of undercooked.  But the pancakes were phenomenally good.  I was mad that I didn't order them, and the boy probably was too since I kept stealing bites of his.  I would probably come back here again (for the pancakes if nothing else).  You know, it's diner-y, but not Denny's or IHOP."}
{"text":"Why the heck would you go to IHOP when you could come HERE??!?!?  I've only been here late at night and it gives this creepy/killer Bob from Twin Peaks is at the other table kinda vibe but I don't give a damn.  The food is great for an excellent price.  I don't think you can compare the quality of pancakes between here and IHOP.  There is no contest."}
{"text":"A bit dated but for its age there is no neglect.  I've been in larger chain restaurants that were not as tidy as Blueberry Hill Family Restaurant hereto referred as Blueberry Hill."}
{"text":"We checked out this restaurant, since it was close to our hotel.  The food isn't overpriced since it is delicious.  Will be eating here when I'm back in Vegas.  The service is amazing, very friendly.  Go check it out, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"The food was outstanding and they had two eggs sunny-side up medium, rye toast, bacon, biscuits and gravy. The service however was mediocre at Best. They don't seem to have enough wait staff to handle all their tables. As long as you bear that in mind, you can come and get some really great food."}
{"text":"This place was very good. I don't eat pancakes regularly but these were in my top 3 of all times. The specials look especially tasty. The service was out of this world. I believe it was Nancy and should be example ALL waitresses should be like. Friendly, attentative and informative. If I lived in Vegas I would be a patron of theirs regularly. The restaurant is exceptionally CLEAN. I don't know about the other restaurants if it is a chain, but I will be a customer of theirs."}
{"text":"This is a really nice restaurant. I don't think you'll regret coming here. Portions are good, food is good, i didn't wait long. Prices are reasonable. Pancakes are really good!!! The blueberry ones have a lot of blueberries. Not 5 stars because honestly there are fancier, newer, cleaner places out there but this isn't bad at all."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and it is definitely a great place for breakfast, brunch,  lunch, or dinner!  There is something on the menu for every appetite.  I had the corned beef hash omelette with a side of French toast. Both of these were excellent and portions are very large.    The coffee is not fantastic,  but it is comparable with other diner like restaurants.   I sat at the counter and service was good. I was acknowledged right away and my food came up right away."}
{"text":"I went for breakfast. The service was good and the portions were huge. I had the Chef's Special which was French toast, 2 eggs and a huge slice of ham. The French Toast was prepared just right and (surprise) the eggs were cooked the way I ordered them. A bit expensive but all in all well worth the trip.I will go back."}
{"text":"Went and ate here Friday night 7/7 after nba summer league game...must have been a bad night for cook because out breakfast was horrible"}
{"text":"1st time there and everything was great. Plus the service. It was busy and our waitress was very attentive to us."}
{"text":"Classic Diner food, a lot of which is made from scratch.  I personally love their blueberry pancakes the most.  You will never need an appetizer or dessert here.  Every entree you get is massive."}
{"text":"Love this place! Never a line. Waitress was genuine and service tip top.  Had blueberry pancakes.... Yum!  Food is good all American fare. Portions are really good sized!  Price is very reasonable!!!"}
{"text":"This was our second time at Blueberry Hill, and we left here just as satisfied as we had before. We were in search of a decent breakfast spot that didn't require parking and a hike through a casino, or waiting 45 minutes to be seated ... needless to say, this fit the bill!   We were seated immediately despite the restaurant being pretty full. I ordered an omelet and was given a choice of side. I went with the house potatoes and toast. The food does the trick, but I wouldn't call it spectacular. My husband actually really didn't like the steak skillet, he complained it had no flavor and didn't finish his meal.   The menu is HUGE! Tons for everyone to choose from.  Service was wonderful. Our waitress, Victoria, was very attentive and helpful.  The price was OK for Vegas. It was right around $55 for myself, my husband, and one kids meal shared between my two toddlers.   Overall, it's a nice place, but probably more like 3.5 stars, than 4 stars in my opinion.   I would definitely come here again although I'm not sure my husband will be joining me. :/"}
{"text":"Almost a weekly Sunday morning ritual!  Pretty much my boyfriend and I drive from the NorthWest to have breakfast here.  The food is always good and the service is fast.  One day we may become the customers the waitresses remember.  The pancakes are always thick and fluffly which I love!  You just can't get those at Denny's, or I don't think you can.  I have yet to visit for any other meal but if breakfast is good, than the other food must be also.  I like comfort food!"}
{"text":"A go to place for breakfast when I am on that side of town. It has an old-fashioned feel that I like and food that is great."}
{"text":"Lord forgive me for what I did to those banana pancakes with the whipped cream and pecan sauce!   This was my first time eating here, even though all my friends told me to try them years ago. I must say those frigging pancakes were literally the BEST I've ever tasted by far. In comparison to Dennys/IHOP everything else tasted the same. Cooked to order is the motto when eating at places like this. A bit expensive, but the home cooked taste is well worth it. The specialty type pancakes ($10-$12) come with 4 pieces. Prepare for a doggy bag, these bad boys are huge and filling. They actuall mix the fruit directly into the batter, and then top them off with said fruit. Glad I tried this place, and will recommend it to others. I will be returning here from time to time. 4 stars ONLY because the cook Miguel had a complete attitude with the hostess. He also complained alot over food. I speak and understand Spanish so that's how I know. He was asked to cook my hash browns well, and he asked \"why\" as if he was the one eating it. Dude just cook my food the way I like it and hush up! Your a cook... so cook. Like do nothing but cook sir. Thanks.  Other than that 1 issue, I'm pretty satisfied."}
{"text":"I have to say that I wasn't impressed at all. It started as soon as we sat at the table. The saucer for my coffee cup had caked on food with a long hair attached to it. Since I don't drink coffee I moved it to the end of the table so it could be removed. When our server came to the table it was straight business. No greeting or pleasantries. That's fine. I get it, you're busy. I ordered an appetizer of spicy wings. I clarified I didn't want Buffalo wings. Guess what I got? Not to mention it was 20 mins later. Our meals came 10 minutes after that. The food left a lot to be desired. Did I mention that the coffee cup with the old food and hair on it was still on the table. Apparently our server didn't think much about it. Save yourself the aggravation and just keep driving by this place."}
{"text":"I came here with my wife and this place right here..... Where do I even begin? Should I start with how good the honey coconut chicken waffle was or the full house breakfast!? I'll start with the honey coconut chicken waffle. Even the name itself makes me salivate and have dreams of how good it is. HONEY COCONUT CHICKEN WAFFLE. It was delicious! The chicken was perfect!"}
{"text":"My wife & I end up here base on the recommendation of the Westin hotel's bell desk personal since I asked that we like a local breakfast place away from the strip.  Arrived with Uber around 10am and the restaurant is busy, we sat @ the bar counter with out Waite, Alison is our server whom did a good job. We ordered veggie omelet & crape and both dishes came out great with big portions. The food is fresh & the service is good.  I highly recommend the resturant if you like to getaway from the Casino's food and dine with the locals, it's well worthy of your getaway."}
{"text":"Where do the Vegas locals eat?? This place!!  This is a good place to check out if you want to stray away from the strip and the tourists. The prices are great and they give you loads of food.  The service was great...our waitress was very friendly and attentive. Coffee cups were refilled continuously and to me that's always a good thing :)  Oh and the Blueberry pancakes are so yummy. They are large so you might want to share. It was too early for me to order dinner but it all looked so good. Next time I'm in Vegas I will definitely consider this place for a nice home-style cooked meal."}
{"text":"Found this little gem while yelping for waffles and pancake with my girlies I will visit this location EVERY vegas trip now!  I'm from Los Angeles btw! Ordered: -Cinammon Twist pancakes (2 days in a row)- HIGHLY RECOMMEND, pretty sweet though -Wheat pancakes with bananas, chocolate chips and whip cream on the side-DELISH -Chili Chese Fries. Not what I expected, there were pinto beans in the chili. I wouldn't order it again - Nachos. It's decent, I've had better -Chicken and waffles. Go to Roscoe's instead  The menu is amazing! Pictures EVERYWHERE which i adore. I can't wait to try something else the next time I'm in LV!"}
{"text":"Quintessential diner. Good breakfast, sizeable portions, good value. Looking for something off strip and in mood for breakfast, I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"First time visiting. Heard good things from others. Not good with customer service. Waited 10 minutes in lobby of empty restaurant . Was told they did not see us. The taste of food and service by Hugo, made the experience better."}
{"text":"This was our second visit.   SOOO good. Got lucky and no wait. The food is fresh and delicious. You will not leave hungry. Big yummy portions. This time we had pigs in a blanket and an omelet.  Boy was it good. The pancakes are big and fluffy.  The staff is great.   It's very popular so you might have to wait."}
{"text":"the pancakes are friggin' awesome, as promised by my sister-in-law. they are fluffy with a great consistency that made them simply melt in your mouth. in addition to sharing the pancakes, i got the full house breakfast: two over-easy eggs, two stripes of bacon, two sausages and two homemade strawberry crepes. it was a perfect variety for brunch.  i'd definitely come back when in vegas."}
{"text":"One of the more underrated spots to eat, in my opinion. It doesn't have that sexy vibe like some of the specialized restaurants you would find downtown. It's not a hipster hangout. There are no cool and interesting decorations they showcase. The place does not have some sort of specific theme to it. Just a straight-forward, no-nonsense diner-type eating establishment. The waitresses there are older and look as if they don't take any attitude from anyone, yet they are cordial and nice. The food is decent and portions are good. There's not really a gotta-try-this item on their menu. The price is reasonable also. It's great for a small group to go grab a bite to eat or have coffee after being out on the town all night."}
{"text":"No one bothered to mention that the seating sucks!!! We had family visiting from out of state and there were only six of us and a baby and we all couldn't even sit together. It was so crappy. We waited in line for half an hour only to be seated at separate tables next to each other. They should have told us that was the case and we would've found somewhere else to go! Btw who the hell puts broccoli and carrots in a veggie omelette?! A veggie omelette should be gee idk things like peppers, onions, zucchini, potatoes, jalapeños , mushrooms, tomatoes maybe....but carrots and broccoli???! I felt like i was eating veggies left over from someone's dinner the night before. I will not be returning. With all that said, the portions are enormous so if you go with multiple people you can easily share and get full. That was another unknown fact, lots of food was wasted $80 later.  I was so embarrassed because id heard such great things about this place only to be continuously disappointed."}
{"text":"This Blueberry hill is a winner with a huge menu.  While a little more $$ than some family style places in town the food is good and the portions are large. Uriel had the chicken and waffles which was huge with waffles, fried chicken breads and a apple compote on top with whipped cream to boot.  I had a great club sandwich with of frys and Ignacio had his Blueberry favorite which is the chilaquilles.  No Complaints here and service was top notch.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Wow...great diner...went on Xmas day 2016 alone.  Walked from the Flamingo hotel (I dont recommend the walk).  I had googled before my trip to find where I could have a traditional xmas turkey dinner.  They came up with great reviews so I looked at the menu online.  Very very extensive menu which explains the line out the door when I got there....I walked to the front and said I was happy to eat at the bar...seated immediately !!  I could see most of the dinner which was carpeted with booths or 4 person tables and looked decent.  Couple of beers and a salad with the HUGE turkey dinner with stuffing, gravy, mashed, cranberries, buns and I needed the long walk back to the flamingo to not feel so stuffed.  I love walking in Vegas, using the Tram and public transportation...anyone going there...I recommend it as a better way to know the city. Contact me directly for pointers on visiting Vegas for the least amount of $$....I have a few tricks."}
{"text":"Blueberry Hill is a must breakfast place when in Vegas! Everything in their menu is delicious ! Portions are big. I have tried several items on their menu and I still have a lot to try ! Waffles and especially their French toasts are to die for!"}
{"text":"My fave bfast spot in vegas.   As the name suggest. Get the blueberry pancakes!   Service was magnificent. Old school waitresses with sassy mouths.    Decent to grande portions with affordable pricing. Sunday brunch is crowded so plan accordingly!   Skittle bfast are kknda small. Hash browns def commercialized. Four egg ommies are ginormous. Food tastes commercialized except pancakes for some reason.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"I walk in and am asked to seat myself by our waitress, this is usually not a problem for me. However when all but one table are still full of trash and sticky, it is. After about 10 minutes a nice waitress in a different section comes over to us and asks us if we have been helped. Our waitress comes to the table, I'm unsure of her name and it really doesn't matter. She acts put out as we place our drink order and rudely interjects that they don't have the drinks we originally wanted. We settle on drinks and place our food order. At the end of taking everything down, she asks me if I know they close at 9pm, mind you it is 8:23pm. After all of this I'm pretty hot, the worst part of this is that I would have given this place a million stars years ago when I lived here. The trip back to this specific location was supposed to be nostalgic. This is a great example of how a bad employee can ruin a business. Based on this experience, I cannot in good faith, give this anymore than 1 star. I weigh heavily on customer service, I'm sure the food would have been great, but I didn't get that far."}
{"text":"Our favorite Blueberry Hill Restaurant in Vegas out of all the locations. It's worth the extra travel time to get here."}
{"text":"Do not go here! Phil the owner is extremely rude!I sent my food back because of several reasons. My eggs tasted weird, my potatoes were not hot and they were hard like they were old, and the rest of the food on my plate was not hot, or anywhere near right out of the kitchen.  If I am going to eat at a restaurant and pay 10-15 bucks per plate I WANT IT FRESH. JUST MADE! not sitting around cooling off, or even sitting under the warmer for 10 minutes because that literally ruins the dish.  My childrens pancakes were HOT! Anyways,  A few moments later Phil comes out with the thermometer stuffed into the food and rudely says \"its 130* it meets food regulations.\"    There is a lot more to this story, but im not wasting 1 more minute on this bad review. I will never go back to this blueberry hill. Phil needs an attitude adjustment."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff, clean location.  Of you leave this place hungry.  It's your fault.  Prices are reasonable; breakfast, lunch and dinner(if you are from the South..that's supper ) Best coffee that I've found in Vegas.  There is no rushing people in and out.  Take your time and enjoy the food.  Huge selection on the menu, and two kitchens staffed and the food is fresh.  Eggs are USDS %, but there is substitutes for them If you do not like, have allergies, or look for egg whites.  Oops, almost forgot...cakes, and pies look amazing.  Get yourself a slice...if you have room left   The portions are huge on most, but carry out is available.  Also now waiting counter service."}
{"text":"5 stars for the excellent service we've received . Specifically from Berenice! She warmly greeted us and immediately made my girlfriend and I feel welcomed as if we were her family. The ambience was very laid back and friendly. She even let us sit in a private area just for us two. Definitely will be back! :)"}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast!  The portions are HUGE!! So come hungry.  We ordered the Meat lovers skillet and biscuit (which was soooo soft!) We also ordered the chicken fried steak country style.  Wonderful!  With the added bonus of a toasted biscuit underneath the steak and gravy, it put it over the edge!  Pancakes are so fluffy.  Everything was great!!!"}
{"text":"This is the best place to have breakfast when visiting Vegas!! Who needs Buffett?! This is way better than anyplace on the strip. Amazing service and generous portions (you will get full!!)"}
{"text":"Great service and fast food delivery.  The food is as good as it tastes as well.  Will be back for sure next time around"}
{"text":"I've came here numerous times and love this place. The pancakes are great. Especially with a little bit of whipped cream. The service is great and really feels like you're in a calm and relaxed environment. Because of a time I ate here with a lot of my family. We took up some space LOLZERZ!!"}
{"text":"Very good breakfast place. I prefer the waffles over the pancakes since they're lighter. The pancakes were dense. I ordered the Waitress Special with turkey patties and they were so good. I actually finished the entire dish!  If your kids are light eaters, just have them share a plate; don't waste food and money. My kids had plenty of leftover pancakes since they each got 2 regular sized pancakes with their eggs, bacon, and sausage (this all came in the meal)."}
{"text":"I came here a couple of times for breakfast. The food quality was good and fresh. The service on both occasions needs improvement. I would try this place again."}
{"text":"Terrible service, ordered waffle with sausage got bacon instead.told waiter and instead of saying let me fix that he says \"are you sure you ordered sausage\"? i have it written that you ordered bacon,then he went on to say \"I do this everyday\" .so does that mean you don't make mistakes? Then he walks away shaking his head..He just kept on arguing.At that point I told didn't want any of the food.Never will go back there again."}
{"text":"Place was great. Busy Sunday morning. Seated right away. Food took a bit of time but coffee (Good coffee!) was flowing.  Had the pork chops with eggs.  Excellent!!!  Super delicious.  Waffles looked awesome but I didn't have any room."}
{"text":"I usually do not review places that already have a bunch of excellent reviews. BUT I feel these pancakes deserve another excellent review! They were the best I ever had. Now I am on a pancake crusade to find a local joint to match these.   #Best Blueberry Pancakes"}
{"text":"Venturing off strip we decided to give Blueberry Hill a try. A local friend recommended it. It was pretty busy, but we got seated quickly and service was quick. The pancakes were so good as well as the crepes. Even the eggs! I loved it!! Next time I visit, I will definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Amazing amazing amazing breakfast, brunch, lunch and dinner! Extremely affordable and good food quality. Diner kind of themed look. Pretty big portions and the food tastes amazing. I've been here twice and it's gonna start to become my weekly spot for breakfast w my boyfriend. We both love this place and we're very well impressed and taken by surprise on how good everything was from the beginning to end."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, service, prices, people, and food! Waffle with eggs and bacon and I'm off to enjoy my day with a full belly! They even remember your name!"}
{"text":"Bad customer service. One of my orders was wrong and on my other order I asked for no pickles, as I ate my burger I could smell pickles, as if it was placed on my burger then taken off.  Plus they do not  give you a receipt of what you were charged for. They wrote our total on a piece of paper. I asked the cashier about it and she said, \"we are an old fashioned diner and we are going to remain that way\", with a horrible attitude.    The one star is for the tasty onion rings and curly fries. The burger could have been good if they would not have left pickle juice on my burger."}
{"text":"This place is always good. There is a fantastic waitress named Suzie, that has been here for 20yrs. She's a very warm, nice lady. My husband and I have been visiting BBH for the last 15yrs and we've had Suzie as our waitress most of those visits.   The coffee is great, and the food is always great. My husband ordered strawberry crepes for the first time. They were amazing ! This place has a large menu that has something for everyone. And kids meals are 99 cents."}
{"text":"This is a great find.  My husband and I went on the off-beaten Vegas path to eat here before we drove back to L.A.  It was nice to eat somewhere besides a Vegas buffet, and this place definitely knows what they are doing in the breakfast category.  I had an amazing Juevos Rancheros, which was the perfect cure to a bad hangover.  The portions are huge, and the food is hot & fresh.  This will be our traditional last stop in Vegas from now on!"}
{"text":"Wow.  Great find!  Wife and I got the the 4 egg omelette- Denver.  It's huge.  And the ham looks freshly sliced, not the cheap chopped stuff most places but in bulk.  I ate the omelette and she had my side of pancakes.  Hats great that we can share one meal!  This will become our go to breakfast spot when visiting Vegas now!"}
{"text":"Praise Jesus and Have a Good Breakfast!  The food was great. We ordered chorizo and eggs and biscuits and gravy. The chorizo and eggs was just right, not too greasy. They make their own refried beans, and they were some of the best I've had in Las Vegas. The tortillas seemed homemade. The biscuits and gravy were delicious. The biscuits were fluffy and definitely tasted like they were made from scratch. The bacon was ordered extra crispy, and it was just that. I was impressed with the large menu. I am not a big breakfast eater, but I do love Mexican choices. Their was a great variety from their  South of the Border selections.  The restaurant prides itself on being a \"family restaurant\" which is probably why they played Christian Rock and Christian Hot Adult Contemporary music. Now, I am not really religious, but I wasn't offended. It just seemed a bit odd. It seems strange to have Christian music playing at the family restaurant that also has video poker machines. The worst part about Christian music is not the message, but the fact that it is not good music. I probably would have added an extra star if it weren't for this music.   If you hate Christian music or this quasi-proselytism, then this is not the place for you. If you are able to look past this, then enjoy a great breakfast."}
{"text":"We stop here every time we are in Las Vegas.  It's a little off the strip but the price is right and the food is good.  It's more of a locals place which in my travels I have noticed usually has the best food at the best prices."}
{"text":"I've been going to this spot since I was a kid, my grandma use to take me here to eat and it was always good. The fact that my girlfriend and I spent early 3am mornings as friends and now come here at least 1 a week as a couple makes this place even more special. The food is delicious it's like a lil hole in the wall place that reminds me of home cooked meals growing up that my parents and grandma cooked for my sister and brothers and I as kids. The prices aren't that bad and the service most times is good. I've only had one bad experience here that I could remember but that doesn't effect us coming here considering that person no longer works here. Overall this is a great place to eat with family, friends and loved ones."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if this is the most legitimate way to judge a restaurant, but I was hungover and after eating the food at Blueberry Hill, I still felt like I wasn't satisfied. Granted, I didn't try their pancakes, but the food tasted mediocre and was sparse.   I had the corn beef hash with eggs and hash browns. The corn beef was good and was the standard that you could get at any breakfast place. The hash browns were a little stale and the eggs were eggs.   Yay for ketchup."}
{"text":"Great breakfast here, Large portions at very good prices and lots of menu selections! Dinner & lunch items looked good, maybe next time! Spacious location a few miles off the strip on Flamingo Rd. Our waitress was right out of \"Mel's Diner\" from Alice. (not quite Flo, but close)  She was nice & helpful as well as funny. Open 24 hours, Will visit again on my next Vegas trip!"}
{"text":"Looks can be deceiving! It was our first stop after we checked in and being part of the Golden Nugget family, I was pleasantly surprised with the food and service! I had the chorrizo omelette which had the right amount of kick! My fiance had the Irish Eggs Benedict and another couple had the chicken and waffles. All were excellent! The juice is fresh squeezed and coffee is of quality! Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Came here recently for breakfast. I was alone waiting for someone I dropped at the doctor.  Had the eggs Benedict with the potato pancakes added to the Benedict in between the muffin and the ham. Side of fruits. Sounds amazing but what I got was not amazing.   The potato pancake was raw and gross, very squishy and white. The ham was really thick, and not what I expected. Some people like tons of ham, I don't ,this was like a hockey puck. Unfortunately I had to send it back. I NEVER send food back. I felt really bad, but I just couldn't eat it. The server was very nice, and didn't mind, because she was so cool thats why I give 3 stars.  Instead I got some poached egg with fruit and an english muffin. Turned out fine, just won't order the potato pancakes again."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! Open 24/7! Just like Zippy's! Lol!  Geez, what does Blueberry Hill Family Restaurant remind me of? Well........it kinda reminds me of a Yum Yum Tree, Denny's, The Original Pancake House, Zippy's.......all rolled up into one!  Apparently Blueberry Hill Family Restaurant has been around since 1966, but they have been serving the Las Vegas area since 1987!  They have 4 restaurants within Las Vegas area, and I chose to take my friends to the restaurant on Decatur Blvd., as it was just across the street from the U.S. Post Office (I had to mail some stuff out), and because it was not too far from the downtown Las Vegas hotels.  As we walked into this restaurant, it was packed! Lucky for us, we were able to get seated right away.   Upon scanning the menu, I ended up picking the \"Grubsteaker Breakfast\" ($12.59) -  which consisted of Half-Pound of 100% Certified Angus Beef topped with two slices of thick bacon smothered in cheddar cheese. Meal is served with 2 large eggs (anyway you want it), hashbrowns, & toast or a muffin. You may substitue 3 pancakes instead of toast & hashbrowns. I took my meal with the pancakes, cuz I just love pancakes! And of course I had to have my coffee too!  One of my friends also picked the \"Grubsteaker Breakfast\" , but he took the hashbrowns & toast. He also ordered an - Arnold Palmer. When he ordered that, I had to ask........what da hell is an \"Arnold Palmer?\" Basically it's pineapple juice & lemonade......  My other friend took the Very Berry French Toast - which was French Toast topped with stawberry & whipped cream. He also drank a vanilla milk shake.........after he had drank & eaten all of that..........he told me he had diabetes! Lol! Can we say \"Sugar Overload?\" Lol!  What can I say about my meal?  Love it! A great hearty breakfast! Loved the fluffy eggs........bummed that they didn't have shoyu, but yeah.........we not in Hawaii, we on da mainland! The hamburger steak thing was ono, & meaty! The thick bacon topped with the gooiest of cheddar cheese..........how can you go wrong? Everything taste better with BACON! Lol!  Service was Excellent! I forgot to get our server's name, but she was friendly, fast, & efficient!  What away to top off my quick trip to Las Vegas..........after eating my hearty breakfast, lunch was not needed...........  I would be more than happy to come back here again for breakfast! I just love this place!"}
{"text":"Good place for breakfast with lots of choices for breakfast. Thier french toast its Omg delicious you dont need to put maple syrup if you dont want to, the coffee is always fresh and the staff is so friendly."}
{"text":"We asked an employee at our hotel where to eat breakfast/lunch and she recommended blueberry hill. We were so pleased! It's like a diner, locally owned and operated and portions are HUGE!! My parents got breakfast (my moms omelet was enormous- it could easily have been shared) and I got lunch. Loved it. And loved that it was local. The menu is huge, so I can't imagine going here and not finding something that you could enjoy."}
{"text":"This is good old home cooked type; southern cooking!!    Someone suggested this place as a locals spot (I didn't go to Vegas to be in the party zone, I went to be in the rest and relaxation zone) and it was better than I'd expected based on the look of the place from the outside.  Suzie was my server, and she was all \"honey\" \"sweetie\" and made me feel as if I were the only person in this place.  She said \"I'm thinking about putting ______ or _____ on special today for x amount\" and I said \"okay, I'll take a look at the menu\"  I ordered a skillet breakfast with a blueberry muffin.  Those potatoes in the skillet were something special, seasoned perfectly, crispy and flavorful, the meat was good, the eggs perfectly cooked as ordered.  My favorite thing?  That blueberry muffin from heaven!!!  It was the best blueberry muffin I've ever had!!  EVER!    Impeccable service, kind people and the food is plentiful.  I took left overs back to my room and had a re-purposed meal the next day!!  Great value!  Oh, and they run the little Christian book store attached; and it's great!  I went in there and got hugged on and prayed with!"}
{"text":"FYI It gets crowded but the food is well worth the wait! The menu is full of wonderful sounding dishes! I choose 6 slices of French toast,& a side of bacon! An it was perfect! My eyes were much bigger than my stomach! The potions are hearty,& yummy! The waitress was Raven very polite,& timely! I absolutely  recommend this place! If your looking for a good meal for a good price this is the place to go!!!"}
{"text":"Blueberry hill is like the hidden gem of Vegas!   They have awesome food and such a huge variety to cater to different wants/needs! I have not had one bad experience at blueberry hill. They are another level above Denny's, ihop, and black bear diner. It is our togo spot when it comes to breakfast for sure!....even if a 'family' owned location is a 15 minute drive away, so worth it!  I recommend their pancakes, French toast, and their chorizo skillet. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Our breakfast experience was wonderful!  Delicious food and good service.  It did seem to be a lengthy dining experience, with quite the space between visits from our server, and delivery of courses.  That's my only complaint, and it's a tiny one.  Sometimes a long, lazy Saturday morning breakfast is wonderful.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Ended our trip in Las Vegas with a fantastic breakfast here. I had the honey coconut chicken waffles. They were soooo good!!  Huge menu.  We will be back for sure.  Thankful for yelp for finding gems like this."}
{"text":"Mmmmm coconut chicken n' waffles!  This place was a great breakfast find near the convention center. It beats all the chain places, well worth the short drive from the strip. Great iced coffee too."}
{"text":"yo the french toast here was pretty damn good!! i've been disappointed by so many french toasts, but this place was really good. and i ordered an omelette actually, but i got a choice of not only toast, hash browns, country potatoes, and pancakes, but french toast too!!!! how awesome is that?!?! on the other hand, my spinach omelette had that chopped frozen spinach in it and it was NOT good. so sad.... but the coffee was good, our server was super attentive and sweet, and again, the french toast amazing. the portions were also HUGE but it wasn't exactly cheap either. so all in all, i'd go again, but i'd just stick to french toast :)"}
{"text":"Haven't ate at a Blueberry Hill since I was a teen, and I remember it the same way as it always used to be. The interior hasn't looked like it really changed since years ago. Their menu has a fairly decent amount of variety when it comes to combination plates and different meals to choose from whether it's breakfast, lunch, or even something you would consider as dinner.  Our server was friendly and prompt with our meal, and I ended up having the veggie omlette substituted with egg whites instead. DELICIOUS! It was so filling I couldn't finish the entire portion, their portions in general are plenty and you definitely get good side items of toast or hash browns. Blueberry Hill has always been an A-OK place for me to go to when craving breakfast items instead of IHOP."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast there on our last day in Vegas.  I am disappointed that I did not go here sooner so I could have went back again!  We each had chicken and waffles.  I got a specialty flavor, coconut chicken! It was outstanding.   The hashbrowns didn't do it for me at all. The pancake was hugely overpriced but delicious so I am glad we split one between us."}
{"text":"I actually love this place!  The food, the staff and service is great!  The only thing I don't look forward to is the cigarette smell from some of the staff.  But because they are super nice and play along with my kids, it's okay and I can live with it. But yeah having the scent of cigarette while serving is not ideal.    Aside from that, I prefer this place over IHOP or Denny's anyway!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty solid.     Do you remember the old TV show \"Alice\"?   If you do, you are an old fart like me, but that's another subject.   For some reason this place reminded me of Mel's Diner - except the food was good!     We were there on a late Saturday morning and they sat us without any wait.   The place is diner for the local folks and I like that.   It's the kind of place where the waitresses work there forever - keep your coffee cup full and will call you \"Hon\".   My wife and I ordered up a good old fashion breakfast, nothing too fancy, eggs, bacon, waffle, etc.    Even though the place was pretty full, our food came out pretty quickly and it was tasty.    As I munched on my eggs and waffle, I thought to myself this is a great place to have a \"recovery breakfast\".    Yes - you know what I'm talking about.     The price was reasonable and I thought it was a great value.   What I really liked about this place is that it was a nice, simple, well cooked meal.     Will I be back?  Heck yes I will."}
{"text":"Our favorite 24 hour restaurant. Many times being out late when everything else has closed down, who wants fast food when you can go here for some good food and great deals. They have specials and you can eat cheap. Everything we have ever tried is very good. Good quality food and you get your moneys worth for sure! Great place to meet some friends and you never feel rushed. Service can be a bit slow later at night when there are not to many waiters.  Try their cakes and pies they are really good!"}
{"text":"OMGMy husband and I went to  ~~~~BLUEBERRY HILL RESTURANT~~~~ It was AMAZING. Holy huge pancakes. The corn beef hash egg white omelette was awesome. My husband had the apple chicken waffle and he loved it. He never leave leftovers however this time he did. I always leave leftovers. We had excellent service her name is  Joanna. Every time we go in there we always ask for her. She is very pleasant.  We have had other servers that is nice as well."}
{"text":"My hopes were high, but I was a bit disappointed. The service was a 5 star, so I want to commend the waitress who kept our water glasses and coffee cups full non-stop. She was also on top of her game with clearing dishes, and getting our food right.   The mozzarella sticks were strange looking- beige, not golden brown, and the cheese inside was cold and hard. The waitress took it back and deleted it off of our order.   Nachos- 1 star. The chips were a bit cold and stale. i was not digging it at all.   Vanilla malt shake- 3 star. Was good.   Beef soup- 4 star. Pretty dang good, unexpectedly.   Chill cheese fries - 1 star. Had random brown beans that stood out on it's own as though it was just scattered on top of a chill sauce. The fries were good though.   I shall go back still, to try other items."}
{"text":"Very Good food, Great selection and prompt attentive service. The Menu is fantastic, yes its big.... none of the recipes are that complicated. But they are tasty. The pies are particularly good, and anything on the breakfast menu is A +"}
{"text":"Decent local breakfast spot. Earlier the better as is can get really crowded on the weekends. Much better alternative to your usual Denny's/ihop"}
{"text":"first time ever coming to this place. We where going to ihop but decided on trying this place out (always drive by it) so glad I stopped by. I luved the old fashioned feel. And yummy breakfasts! I couldn't decide on what to get (they all looked so good)  !! We got Fast service. Our food was ready within minutes of ordering. Never had to ask for my coffee refill or anything (typically I have to ask for refill) and the food has large portions and did i already mention it was delicious? Lol  Coffee was really good too!! Will definitely be going back to this place soon. :)"}
{"text":"I liked the homey diner feel of this place. The menu is huge! I got French toast, which was excellent. The portions are big, the food is tasty and the service is great. If I lived in Vegas, I would definitely make this a frequent stop."}
{"text":"Over the last 20 years I've eaten breakfast all over Vegas. Blueberry Hill is the best for down home best pancakes, omelettes, crepes, biscuits & gravy... all that stuff. Went here with my sons & brother and we ordered just about everything we saw (6 entrees) and shared it all. There was nothing average or yucky. Good quality ingredients (I heard its all from scratch) and the service was great. The diner atmosphere is awesome too.  If you frequent Vegas, give this place a try if you're near. It's worth it!!"}
{"text":"We had someone in our party that can't have bacon touch any of her food. She told the waitress not to put the bacon on the plate 2 times when ordering. When they brought out the food there was the bacon on the plate. We sent it back. Then she brought it the eggs without the sausage I asked her for the piece of sausage. She got the attitude with me and said that she brought it out already. I said that the bacon was touching the sausage and she can't eat it. She made a weird noise and walked away. I went and spoke with the manager and she took care us and discounted the check. When people have food allergies you should fix the plates right. Plus the food wasn't the best. We won't be back at all. In my mind RIP blue berry hill.."}
{"text":"This is one of my mom's must-go-to places when we go to Las Vegas. It doesn't matter if we go to the one on Flamingo or the one on Decatur. She just has to go. While I was living in Las Vegas, the one on Flamingo was closer so when she visited, that's where we went.   Their portion sizes are always very generous, no matter what you get. This most recent time, we went around lunchtime, so instead of getting the amazing chocolate chip, banana, or apple pancakes like I normally get, I ordered the roast beef special. I loved it! The roast beef was sliced thin, but not sandwich meat thin, and the gravy wasn't too salty.   The rest of my family ordered breakfast and typically it would be a little questionable whether or not the portion size would be enough for my brother, since he's a big guy. But even he said he was full after not finishing it all.   For me, whenever I go, it's always one of the aforementioned pancake choices or either of the meatloaf selections. And they never fail, it's always great.   The only reason I gave them a 4 and not a 5 is because the tables are really squished in there and when I walk around, I always feel like I'm going to run into another table. And I carry a big bag so it makes it even more squished. Otherwise, one of my favorite places!"}
{"text":"The coffee is great. Waitress is really nice. A LOT of choices. Vegetarian friendly. They are willing to sub meat for potatoes. The hash browns are really good."}
{"text":"My last encounter here was not so good.  A bowl of Chili with onions, tomato, celery, and Pinto Beans tasted like it came out of a can.  Biscuits were more like bread.  Hash Browns were greasy and not crisp as requested.  Bacon was hard rather than supple.  An order of Coffee was forgotten by our waitress.  And the men's bathroom was dirty.  But our server was pleasant and my Tuna Salad Sandwich on Sourdough Bread was moist and good.  One star was lost on this night!  Hopefully food and service will bounce back like they have before."}
{"text":"Just came here to eat for the first time with my family( my brother was here before though) and I just got to say that the service here was great and the food just as awesome(:  Sally was just the sweetest, one of the best servers/waitresses I have ever come across. Thanks sally for making my first time experience a very pleasant one ^.^  I got the Guadalajara chorizo skillet and omg it was absolutely delicious"}
{"text":"Decent diner food, way nicer than say a denny's of sorts.  I had a chcicken cheesesteaks sandwhich, and my portion was MASSIVE!!!  I'd come back, especially as it's in the same parking lot as the super 8 motel I'm staying at near the racetrack"}
{"text":"I don't get it. Tried to like this place several times. Service is horrendous. I watched as plate after plate came out wrong and the customers were kept waiting until after their whole party had fnished eaing to get the re-orders.   Although they tout everything is homemade, that's no guarantee it's good. (e.g. My Mom cooked from scratch and it was meh.) Pancakes, which they are \"known for\", taste like they have way too much baking soda in them. Sure, there are 4 of them, but they are thick and large, but are unimpressive in taste."}
{"text":"Yeah this is hands down one of the best restaurants to get a delicious, hearty and home cooked from scratch breakfast!  Like big portions? Mmmmm me too! lol  I had the denver omelette and hashed browns. Easily on the list of mine for last meal on earth. Pancakes mmmmmm yeah baby.   I love breakfast anytime of the day. This is my spot when wanting to fulfill my breakfast needs. Portions are big and hearty! We all love that! lol  I am only rating on breakfast as I have been here twice for that only. I am positive without ever trying anything else on their menu that it is all pretty damn amazing! I would be willing to bet my last ducket on that!  I love Blueberry Hill, I want to give the Owner a big kissy and give them an award for having a kick ass restaurant for me to enjoy!  I will be back soon...very soon!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars - Pending a re-visit  A local favorite.  There are several locations in town, but they all have a very Mom & Pop greasy spoon feel to them as if they were all independently owned and operated.    For our first visit to this location, we tried out the  - Chicken Fried Steak & Eggs with buttermilk pancakes and Blueberry Compote - Chicken Fried Chicken & Eggs with Buttermilk pancakes.  I've gotta tell ya, they have some of the best chicken fried ____  that I've ever tried.  They use actual Steaks for the fried steak and not ground beef.  Both the steakand the chicken were tender and juicy,while the breading was light and crisp, not grease-soaked.  The Pancakes were good and the blueberry compote was not overly sweet like I've had at other diners.  Unfortunately, on this visit, the service wasn't all that friendly, they get a temporary ding for that pending a second visit.  So, for now, 4 stars for the food with a temporary -.5 for the service."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of IHOP and that's what this place reminds me of except not a franchise (at least I don't think so).  The seats are hard, the customers are interesting and the food is just okay.  Service wasn't fantastic but it didn't suck.  I'm not a huge breakfast fan so if you like breakfast then this just might be the place for you."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast twice recently, once in October and also on Christmas day. Wasn't expecting this place to be packed on Christmas day but it was. Despite being packed we were seated quickly (party of four) and were able to get our order in fairly quickly as well. It came out maybe a few minutes later than it normally would have but this was to be expected on such a busy day. As usual the food was great and very well priced. If you're a fan of IHOP, you'll love this place even more."}
{"text":"Relatives in town... Needed a place to break bread off the stripe.  What a great choice. A great variety on the menu for everyone. I had the Chicken Enchiladas, yummy choice - just spiced enough. The gals had breakfast. One order was biscuits and gravy - the biscuits were HUGE.   Now if there was a location closer to Henderson."}
{"text":"Great diner. Management was very accommodating. Helped out my large party during a very busy morning and it went smoothly. Friendly staff. The fruit crepe with the cheese filling was quite tasty- and I thought the cheese filling (blintz style) would be overpowering as I am not a big fan of blintzes. Great corned beef benedict as well. The hot cocoa comes with a cookie on top. Solid spot with options for everyone."}
{"text":"I love Blueberry Hill. If you get one of the good servers you will have hot food, excellent service and a great time. I'd recommend Mary, Margarita, Stephanie and at night-time Kendall. Avoid Nancy at all costs! At this place the server makes all the difference in the world. Pancakes are fluffy, the ham and cheese omelet has top quality ham and cheese, so much better than IHOP or Denny's. I also love the Italian meatloaf."}
{"text":"Huge portions and they never let my coffee cup get empty. That starts them off on a great foot with me.   We were seated immediately even on a Sunday morning. Service was prompt but not overbearing. We had plenty of time to look at the huge menu and the waitress was kind when I asked a few questions about the specials I had sped past on the way to my seat.  Waffles definitely taste like an old school diner. Were all diners issued the same waffle makers way back in the day??Anyways... waffle was huge. Eggs were cooked perfectly. Bacon was cooked perfectly - crispy but not burned. My wifey had the omelet and it was INSANELY huge. I think it was 4 eggs. Whoa. Huge.   I'd dine here again in a heartbeat. Portions were huge and the price was super cheap."}
{"text":"I love this place! BH is a Vegas staple and it has that nostalgic 50's diner feel to it. Oldies playing in the background with greasy diner fare and real ice cream milkshakes that would make Richie Cunningham blush! Prices are cheap and portions are big! I think I just saw the Fonz..Eyyyy!!"}
{"text":"It's cheap and great eats here and I think only locals usually know about this place. We like coming here for breakfast and meeting up with friends from Vegas.    Order it anyway you like it and the food will not disappoint.  It's like a Denny's but 10 times way better.  They have so many choices, as much as Cheesecake factory, probably more.  They tend to serve everything with heaping size of butter, so try to remember to order it w/o.  It's literally a ice cream scoop filled of butter on your pancakes- no joke.  I had their grain pancakes, chicken breast and some potatoes.  It's so good, it's a belly buster.   I think my husband ordered a fat omelet and it was delicious and even he couldn't finish the last bite.  Good service, good food, good company = happy people"}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying a heartfelt thank you to all of my fellow Yelpers out there.  I do the searches and read your reviews and find places I would never have found without your help!   So, about Blueberry Hill Family Restaurant...our visit here was a very good one.  We came for breakfast and a great breakfast we had!  Generous portions of good food with good service makes for good reviews and a lot of them out there on Yelp.  I would be inclined to agree and will be back in the future."}
{"text":"So sad I discovered this place so late! Great food at great prices. Love their choice of sides (great for those with an 11 month old like me!). Service was decent but wow, the food was great :)"}
{"text":"Ok if you hit them up early for there breakfast special.  Average food. Average coffee. Nothing special but nothing horrible.  Better then spending an arm and a leg for breakfast on the strip"}
{"text":"Great breakfast specials. We ended up going here because the Pairs breakfast buffet was an hour long. For 4 adults the tab was $40 which is really good given all the food we ordered. Decent place, but the booth seats were made of hard plastic and were really hard. I have alot of cushing in my rear and my butt was unhappy with the seats. Overall decent food, decent service & good prices."}
{"text":"After being told to give this place a visit for many years and having this place pop up on my Yelp feed numerous times while here in Vegas, I gave in and decided to give it a try.        Upon arrival, I was greeted by the Lucky Charms and Care Bear love child on the sign of the Blueberry Hill Family Restaurant sign (go there, you'll see), and was given the heebeegeebees and even more so when walking into a wall of humidity and being taken back to the 80's. Mini-blinds and purple seating; undoubtedly an old-timey diner. Nobody told me about that. Then being face to face with waxed plates of the days specials was a bit stomach turning as it was something I've never seen before. I wanted to turn back and probably just head to the IHOP parallel to the chapel but I remembered to keep an open mind.        Being seated immediately, I was pretty overwhelmed by the menu, in a GOOD way! So many tasty choices. It was 10AM, time for breakfast, maybe some French toast, perhaps a pastrami sandwich? The poor waitress had to come back twice for me to make a decision until I gave into my sweet tooth and got the Oreo Pancakes. No regrets. For a solid price, I got a generous amount of this so called Oreo pancake and boy, was it muy delicioso! Knowing I couldn't stay for lunch, I just had to get the pastrami sandwich to go!        All in all, the food was fantastic and is a must have while at the strip, don't let the atmosphere intimidate you. Service was fast and friendly! Four stars!"}
{"text":"So I've recently moved back to Vegas and this used to be my favorite place for breakfast. I've eaten here 3x since July and each time it hasn't been very good, I don't know what happened lol the younger waitresses here need to learn how to be good at their jobs, like checking back with the customers come around with refills on beverages. Today the girl was standing behind the counter reading something and it was annoying because she'd take people's orders and it didn't seem she was checking on anyone else either. The biscuits and gravy were dry there was a small amount of gravy with these enormous fat biscuits that looked like rolls, the ratio was off.  My order came with hash browns and I was served a minimal amount was on my plate like none were left to give lol   The previous visit I had a younger waitress than today and she couldn't get my order correct because she didn't write it down lol I wanted eggs over medium and I received runny eggs, disgusting so she took them back and I got fried hard eggs, that wasn't any better was disappointed having rubber like eggs.   So I've had enough and I think I'll just keep the Omelette House!"}
{"text":"I forgot about this little gem, I had visited other locations and their food & service don't compare. I recognize the waitress when I came in 2 months ago, still sweet and personable. The food at this location is great nothing has changed since I last remember 10 years ago. I won't go to any location, this is my go to in the morning"}
{"text":"I asked a local Foodie for a good Breakfast spot in Vegas and Blueberry Hill was the suggestion and what a good one it turned out to be. As usual when in Vegas I tend to travel off the Strip and dine with the Locals. This habit has never failed me yet for a meal, and after B H I'm still on a roll. I tried the  biscuits and gravy with the eggs over medium and bacon. Now while my breakfast was simple but good I saw some amazing looking things coming out of that kitchen. Pancakes and Waffles with various toppings, Omelettes that couldn't be believed by sight alone. It all had me doubting my own order. But rest assured mine was delicious. Huge home made biscuits (I couldn't finish one) creamy Sausage gravy and perfectly cooked eggs I was content. Service was very good and the prices are fair. Portions are rather large so feel free to split away. This place will be in my Vegas breakfast rotation."}
{"text":"The only reason I gave this place 2 stars is because the food is good ! Okay me and my family have been going to this place since it opened great food but terrible service!! Today was the last straw for me we got sat down today May 30th 2015 so whoever was working today needs to be replaced ! This server with fake horrible eyelashes super rude treated us like we disturbed her unapologetic ! Juan the Manager was just as worthless !!! 3 families came in the same time sat ate left we were still waiting for a drink order ... The staff seriously needs to be replaced it took 50mins didn't even get in a drink order in had to get up and find a server to get water on top of that when we got our order they short changed us from the combo breakfast we ordered and gave us no pancakes SMH!!! Un Believable!!! So we had to deduct that on bill. It was such a horrible experience I will NEVER go back again!!!  So don't even waste you're time going here it's TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE !!!!!  DONT GO HERE! Go to different location !"}
{"text":"Nice to get away from the strip for a morning. Food was pretty good all around and reasonably priced. Staff was also pretty friendly."}
{"text":"Never eat breakfast on the strip again! We had to leave early to drop someone off at the airport and decided to find somewhere close to our hotel to eat breakfast that would not cost $100. There was not a wait on Sunday morning at 8am. A nice young man selling the paper greeted and opened the door for us. We were greeted with good morning and sat right down. The waitress was fantastic. Worked harder than anyone in Vegas to make us happy. And the food! My word did they give us enough. It was great! Good diner style breakfast. The three year old was even impressed. Now that's impressive! Loved the kids coloring mat; it showed us the owners love Jesus also. What a great place! 5 Stars."}
{"text":"my favorite here is the little boy blue which is blueberry pancakes (BOMB) eggs and bacon/sausage.. this place is 24 hours & makes you feel like youre somewhere outside of the glitz and glam of las vegas.. nice staff.. this is a family friendly place & everything tastes homemade.. reasonable prices.. i've only had breakfast because i'm so hooked on it i never want to try anything else :)"}
{"text":"Okay so your sitting there saying to yourself \"Damn these are the best pancakes I ever had\" right? RIGHT! and as much as you try to think of other pancakes..you cant? right? RIGHT! Because blueberry hill has the most amazing breakfast. The first time I visited BHFR I got the french toast, and the BF got the pancakes. Watching him cut those cakes and spread them with butter..I decided to give them a try, and I thought to myself \"I should have got the pancakes\" but hey the french toast was awesome to. The apple chicken sausage was pretty good, I like having the choice of either home fries or hash browns. Because I'm a hash brown kinda chick...Dig!"}
{"text":"Great beak fast.  Food was fresh, portions were generous, and service was fantastic."}
{"text":"This is the exact reason why Yelp at times is not a credible resource. You see legitimate users with legitimate reviews frequently get filtered, and you see 4-5 star ratings for restaurants that provide a low quality product.   For years, I kept reading on Yelp that \"Blueberry Hill\" has the \"greatest hand breaded chicken fried steak in all of Las Vegas\". There was nothing true about that statement.  The chicken fried steak was nothing more than the processed precooked version that you get at Costco and Smart N Final. All they do is reheat it and serve. I was very disappointed on account of all the good reviews on yelp about how the steak was a \"real sirloin that was hand battered\".   The side salad was merely lettuce with 1 ring of red onion, served in a beaten up plastic bowl. No tomatoes, no cheese, no croutons...nothing. The Ranch dressing tasted like water mixed with mayonnaise.    The biscuit that came with our steaks tasted like garlic bread.   The corn bread that came with our steak never came out. The server forgot to bring it out. We never got it.   On a positive note. The Buser was very hard working and made up for the poor quality service that the server provided. The server was not rude, but she was very forgetful and never came around one time to check on us. You need to flag down the server to get her attention. The Buser compensated for the lack of service by coming around to refill our coffee and water. The server was usually found sitting at the counter and reading a book.  When I asked the server for Tabasco, she forgot. 10 minutes later I asked her again and she finally got it. When I asked the server for Jam, she forgot. When I asked her for saltine crackers, she forgot. She did bring out the check immediately though before we even touched our food.   In conclusion. The bill came out quicker than the food. The buser was the hardest working guy here. The food was processed and low quality. The prices were pretty high. Yelp has failed us all."}
{"text":"The Bagel Cafe has been our favorite way off the strip breakfast for the past few years but on our last trip to Vegas we tried something different.  Blueberry Hill impressed me with their broad menu and lots of home cooked or locally sourced ingredients.  When you first walk in and see the 18 inch tall frosted towers of cake and pie goodness you might not be thinking about the care taken in procuring ingredients but they do get breads from a local bakery and make a lot of their own components on site.  I had a chicken parm sandwich and loved it.  On a second visit we had a table of 8 and Stephanie was there again with wonderful service and an engaging personality.  Everybody enjoyed their food and my parents still talk about how much they enjoyed it even though they had to taxi out from the strip.  I don't have a ton of detailed information about particular menu items but we'll be back and learn more as we go."}
{"text":"Blueberry Hill is THE spot...it's perfect for Sunday morning brunch (read- hungover breakfast ;p) and they have amazing food EVERYTIME!! I usually order the huevos rancheros and the fresh fruit crepes, but the eggs benedict are good and their chicken and waffles rival those of Roscoe's. All in all, Blueberry Hill is a hidden gem in the desert of Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Just left this place my waitress was shitty they bought me scrambled eggs n cheese they look like they were on the counter for 2 hrs they looked plastic. Got an omelette with spinach when we didn't sent it back then it stilled had spinach on it. I ordered pigs in a blanket and the sausage inside was extremely small when in the menu they mention it being large and savory. Never going to this place again."}
{"text":"HUGE portions and great food.  Wish they had more options for Vegans though."}
{"text":"When I head to Blueberry Hill, I usually head to the one on Decatur that's closer to me, but this is a relatively good alternative.   We came here after a long evening and not everyone was in the best mood since we were hungry and tired. The waitress was overwhelmed. Way too many tables for just two waitresses and one busboy from what I could see. She was friendly and tried be as attentive as she could given the circumstances.   My omelet was ok, nothing spectacular but a solid meal. There was lots of meat and it was gigantic for the price. It did the trick. They have an enormous menu with everything your heart could desire to eat. I usually stick with the breakfasts, but they have a huge amounts of lunch and dinner options as well. When I'm looking for some very late night breakfast I usually head to Blueberry Hill. I also really enjoy breakfast as dessert. Nothing satisfies my sweet tooth like some french toast, crepes or pancakes, yum.  Everyone else in my party seemed a little perturbed by the service, but I really have to give them credit for doing the best they could while in the weeds and still keep an upbeat and positive attitude.   Not the greatest restaurant, but hopefully the manager will put more staff during peak hours to take care of guests."}
{"text":"Late night eats and homemade food. Always a good bet.  Blueberry Hill has an extensive menu full of diner food and lots of friendly staff. I almost always get breakfast when I come. It's hard to find a solid breakfast place and this one fits the bill.   So what, it's a chain, but if you're in the mood for french toast at 2am, this is definitely the answer and you'll always be pleased.   Aside from breakfast, they have fantastic dinner specials, desserts and plenty of other delights to indulge in. I have liked everything I've ever tried here. I'll be back, as always."}
{"text":"Hubby and I stopped in on a Tuesday evening around 7ish.. seated right away Our server was Helpful with the large menu choices and kept us smiling with her chipper personality.   She brought refills promptly, explained order questions and the food was brought out quickly.  I had the special, Pot Roast and the meat fell apart, tender and yummy, The Carrots & celery were firm and had not been sitting in a water bath all day.. the mashed potatoes were Real with skins still on.  Good Comfort food for a Native New Yorker.   Hubby had a Bacon Cheeseburger with hashbrowns .  He loved it and couldn't finish the hash browns, we had a nice to-go box at the end of the meal.   Price wasn't too bad.. noticed the Breakfast items were more money than the dinner items.  I guess because it's known for Brekkie..   I am happy we found Blueberry Hill.. it's clean, and homey.  People are nice and friendly, Food good and Lots of it.   We will return :)"}
{"text":"Absolutely worse service in my life. It's been bad service every time we came here. The food was the only thing keeping us coming back. Not anymore. We ordered drinks and waited 20 minutes in an EMPTY restaurant. Finally they arrived and they had audacity to charge us for my one drink despite me saying I had to get to work ASAP. We paid the bill Then they came AFTER us to tell us that they forgot to charge us for one of our drinks! Forget it we will NEVER come back"}
{"text":"OMG this has to be the most amazing breakfast place I've been to in a while. They have very unique breakfast items, portions are giant and the service is good- add affordable prices and you've got an awesome place for breakfast. I'm not a resident of Nevada but when I come back I'll make an effort to stop here!"}
{"text":"When I fist moved to Vegas, I'd always here from people to try Blueberry Hill because it's suppose to be delicious. There's one near my house and it is always packed so I sort of believed the hype...but it was more like \"eh\"...The service was very lacking. Besides being very friendly with my 7 month old baby, we rarely saw her and she didn't even refill my mom's coffee yet the table next to us had 5 refills. The portions are overly proportioned and very worth the price you pay. I had the strawberry pancakes which was more like a tower of pancakes and strawberries. I didn't even eat half of it. It didn't really taste good, it was bland. I'd return to IHOP for my pancake fix in the future. The kids menu has great options to satisfy any needy or picky kid. Beware of the menu for adults. I though Cheesecake was bad, this place is right behind them with all the options they have. The hot cocoa came with whip cream and a chocolate chip cookie in it. That's a nice touch. But not in a hurry to return to this place..."}
{"text":"Good food and good service. I got the apple pancakes and they were great and there was a lot of them."}
{"text":"Food not as good as before. Had an omelette and there was barely any cheese. The hash browns were horrible looked as if they sat around for a while. This was a place my daughter had wanted to go during her visit but we were not happy with the service or the food this time. Something changed at this restaurant and not for the better."}
{"text":"It's definitely an older looking place. Needs to be updated, but the food is awesome. There was so much food we couldn't finish. There were 3 of us. One got short stack pancakes, one got the Full House Breakfast with blueberry crepes and I got the Wild West Omelette without ham. When they say lots of cheddar cheese, they aren't lying. Only thing is that the potatoes (home style potatoes) weren't quite done enough for my liking, but I like mine more on the softer side. Everyone else thought they were fine. You definitely get a lot for your money and the food is great. Coffee is really good too. Not too strong and not too weak. Cups are very large. We all agreed that we would come back again."}
{"text":"If you are tired of the all you can eat buffets with food sitting under the heat lamp for hours, then head off the strip and try this place. I have been many times, and never disapointed. Great hot and fresh food, and plenty of it. Service has been great for me, and they get you seated fairly quickly when there is a wait. The best part is that everytime I went, I was full, and it didn't cost me $12-$24 like the buffet does. So if you are in the mood for a great breakfast after a night in Vegas GO Here it is worth it. In my opinion it is the best breakfast in Vegas. I have not had lunch or dinner here so can't comment on them."}
{"text":"Old school coffee shop with good prices and lots of comfort food! Wish there was one in Henderson !  Only drawback....facility is old and appears to need a really good cleaning!!!"}
{"text":"Great place with friendly staff. The blueberry pancakes were perfect. The rest of the food was great too. Comfortable place to eat away from the strip."}
{"text":"It's Tuesday morning. Not busy. Food took forever. Eggs were just warm so you know they just weren't delivered quick enough. Sausage was getting cold. Half my order came out after the eggs and sausage. This place used to be the place to go to. I guess not anymore. Our booth had food crumbs on the table and seat. And that includes syrup.  My last visit was  near thanksgiving   And they had no pumpkin pie? Nope, no pumpkin pie. I went somewhere else for pie. Too bad."}
{"text":"My only suggestion is to ask NOT to have Mary as your waitperson.  I asked nicely for another placesetting because there were not enough for the number of people at our table.  She sarcastically asked whether she may first finish filling our water glasses and taking our order.  Since we had place our order 10 minutes earlier, we were bewildered and shocked at her contempt towards us.  The breakfast was very good, but we went elsewhere subsequent mornings to avoid this unstable waitperson."}
