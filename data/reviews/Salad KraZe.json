{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place. They catered to our staff luncheons (100+people), my wedding/ baby showers, also they deliver locally. Fresh salad, sandwiches, wraps and soup. Also they sell wonderful fruit smoothies and locally baked goods. We go to Salad Kraze every week since my two year old loves their salad and so do we!"}
{"text":"A great locally owned business that's worth stopping in!! It's a good, healthy, fresh option for everyone, and the service is always mediocrely fast!"}
{"text":"Lived across from them over a year and never tried their food. Went in there on one of my days off. I was surprised they had places to eat in there. I thought it was a carry out place. Staff was not very friendly even after I was nice and tried to make conversation that I lived across the street basically. Got chicken tortilla soup which was excellent. Also got a club sub and a tuna sub. Honestly, I make better subs at home and definitely subway is far superior. Was very disappointed. Was looking for a good sandwich/wrap place. 5 stars on the soup, 1 star on the subs, and 1 star on the friendliness.  Try smiling and getting to know some of your customers like Fenicks nearby does. They are your livelihood and word of mouth is important."}
{"text":"First visit today! I had the Big Salad...and I have to admit...it was more than I could eat. I opted to mix half spinach greens, and half whole wheat pasta, which was delicious and filling.
I was impressed with the selection of salads...and the size of the menu.
I will definately visit again!"}
{"text":"POOR service & poorer quality food! I have heard many good things about their fresh salad from colleagues, but was very disappointed on our experience this evening! The restaurant is moving two doors down the end of the month, and is obvious and the quality of food they are serving! I ordered the Pecan Dijon Salad- they forgot to add chicken. Avocados & lettuce w brown! And when we asked, they said, \"Sorry\" & brought a side of chix over! My husband ordered soup & a Caesar Wrap. The soup was far too hot to even eat & they forgot his side dish with his wrap! He said he enjoyed a McDonald's chicken wrap better!"}
{"text":"Awesome salads and wraps. First time I walked in I was a Lil intimidated by the huge chalk board! Kinda have to study the thing before u order! Love the ranch dressing"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this is listed a vegetarian. Just because it is a salad themed restaurant doesn't mean it is vegetarian."}
{"text":"I really think that Customer Service is very important. The girls behind the counter are very rude, you can tell they are young and don't \"love\" their job. However, the food is good and we haven't tried something we didn't like.

Work on the customer service and this place will really be on top of things!"}
{"text":"Love the salads here. They are absolutely amazing. A little constructive criticism. Get a few more on staff please. I phoned in an order at 12:38pm, and was told 40 minutes. Came in at 1:25pm, and still had to wait another 10 mins for my salad to be made. Again the salads are amazing, but putting anther set of hands behind the counter may be the golden nugget for this place to fly."}
{"text":"Really good ma and pop salad shop! I have had a few of the salads, they are big, fresh and always good. Friendly staff. Wish they had more seating inside."}
{"text":"This place has a great selection of soups, wraps and salads to choose from and I especially like that you can make any salad a wrap. The soups are fabulous and they have different kinds every day. The place is big enough if you want to stay and eat but most people like me get it to go."}
{"text":"I love their Cheesy BLT salad! The only bad side is that making the orders is kinda slow. I would recommend calling in your order ahead of time so you don't have to wait in line. The salads are very large, so if you don't eat much order a small. I love their smoothies, and their wraps are to die for. I would highly recommend this if you are looking for a tasty treat that's healthy!"}
{"text":"Great menu and great prices. The salads are huge!!! The Italian sub is great! We get take out a lot because it's fast and easy with good prices! The autumn crunch salad is my favorite salad and my husband likes the Cesar."}
{"text":"I love so many of the salad creations here or the fact that you can build your own!! Fresh and delicious, it does not disappoint. I've only eaten inside, but will try it for pickup or delivery sometime."}
{"text":"This place is great!
I love salads but I am also too lazy to chop up the ingredients for a good one at home.  Salad Kraze is the answer to my problem!
They have a huge list of salad combinations to choose from or you can create your own concoction from the extensive list of toppings. 
I stopped in the other night and left with a huge container of leafy goodness for under $7!  All the ingredients are muy fresh and the salad dressings appear to be homemade.  This place blows any supermarket salad bar out of the water!
Great local spot that I hope sticks around for a very long time!"}
{"text":"Not impressed.  Tried the Santa Fe salad.  The chicken tasted like it came from a plastic bag.  I didn't taste the avocado until almost the last bite.  The dressing was nothing special.  My son got the Cobb salad with blue cheese and was very disappointed with the dressing.

Atmosphere was okay and the menu selection was plentiful, but we struck out twice in one visit.

Might try again later for lunch vs grabbing a quick dinner on a Friday night.  They closed at 8 PM and we felt rushed as they started to clean up the dinning Area around 7 PM."}
{"text":"I love their salads with pasta noodles. The chicken paprikash soup was really good. The only reason for 4 stars was because we waited a good 15 minutes for our to go order and the limited drinks options."}
{"text":"Cool little place.  I had the turkey wrap and it was very good.  Also had the Stuffed Pepper Soup and Chicken Paprikash soup.  Both VERY good!  I would visit again."}
{"text":"I've tried two different salads and they were both really good.  I like having a healthy option near the office and the for as large as the salads are, the prices are spot on.  My only complaint is that the to-go containers are lacking.  They make it difficult to toss the salad.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"First off, I'm glad to see an independent restaurant in Avon Lake booming, which they do! Salad Kraze is packed all week at lunch time! The Autumn Crunch is my favorite and my daughter loves the wraps and smoothies. Scott the owner does trivia questions with prizes and the setting is family friendly."}
{"text":"I don't think I'll ever find a salad place as incredibly fresh and delicious as Salad Kraze. The baja sald is the GOAT. And pretty much everything else on the menu. Their smoothies are pretty delicious too T_T ugh now I want Salad Kraze.

So good(:"}
{"text":"Great variety, fresh ingredients, fair prices and locally owned. That's all I really need to say. Try the soups!"}
{"text":"Not for me. Would rather buy a bag of lettuce and put some dressing from home on it.  Much cheaper and I can check the date on the bag. 

I got the Asian salad.  The lettuce was 99.9% old iceberg. The dressing was tasty (peanut-ish). Salad had a thick coating of those crispy/fattening, canned chow mein noodles.  

The entire experience was very flat. Not worth returning.  I was looking around and just didn't get it.  Look for that place to mysteriously vanish one day soon.  

Next time I'll go to Wendy's if I feel the urge for a simple take out salad.  Better value and taste."}
{"text":"This place is great! I drove by on my way to a business meeting and knew I had to swing by for a late lunch. Very good salads, great prices, fresh ingredients, specialty cookies, smoothies, wraps, subs. Boom! I got the Santa Fe. Romaine was super crisp and cut perfectly to bite sized pieces. I hate what it's huge leaf chunks and it get all over your face. Chicken was tender and not old. Even the avocados were perfectly ripe. The smoothies looked really good and I will get one next time I am by. Can't wait to eat the double chocolate cherry cookie. I also suggest getting the large salad. It's perfect and less than a $1 more."}
{"text":"Had a very good Greek salad here today for lunch and was very pleased when I got back to work and opened my box the salad portion was excellent. I ordered a small soup also but I was disappointed with the size for the price.

  Service was slow. Not busy but I waited almost 10 minutes until my order was taken. I highly recommend calling in your order if you're pressed for time at lunch.

    The food was fresh and tasted good and the portions on the salad were excellent.  Very nice local business that I will frequent again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I always enjoy getting a salad from here. Their menu is displayed creatively on a chalk board which is a nice touch. I wish they had a fried chicken option to add onto their salads. I enjoy the small bread sticks they provide with their salads."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, quick service for made-fresh food, but most importantly DELICIOUS!!! One of the best salads I've ever had!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent local restaurant in Avon Lake. If u are looking for a fresh salad or wrap then u need to stop. Many different options for both. I had read the reviews and I am now a fan. I will be back ."}
{"text":"First time at this fairly new salad and sub business. Ordered a Nacho salad to eat there and an Italian sub to go.  Fresh is the byword here. The lettuce and vegetables are the freshest i have ever had anywhere.  Large portion with Santa Fe and salsa sauces.  When I got home I took a bite out of the sub and again fresh is the word. This small restaurant has 8-10 tables which fill up fast at lunch and dinner time. They do have a revolving door of people picking up or taking out. Your best bet is calling ahead your order.  If you love salad and subs this is the place to go. (They also have soup and slushies!)"}
{"text":"I guess the only reason we waited so long to finally try Salad KraZe is that Avon Lake has such a poor track record for good eateries that we figured it'd soon be gone.  Well, I was very pleasantly surprised.  The 4 salads we've tried now were all quite good-to-excellent.  Ingredients are fresh and plentiful -- my only complaint being there can be a little too much of he hard, midde-of-the-head lettuce that you'd typically throw out (but that happened only once).  We tried the soup once, which was decent but nothing too special.  The salads, however, are the stars, and they are huge, reasonably priced, and darn tasty.  We've been there twice in the last 8 days... and probably will be there again very soon"}
{"text":"We discovered this place in the last month.  It's really nice inside -- a modern, clean look. The menu is impressive (large) and our wraps and soup were good although a little salty (which is why I took off one star). The potato cheddar soup was filling & good (but salty) and the Asian salad in a wrap was really tasty (but again -- too salty). The smoothie was good as well and the small was massive (like a large from DQ, Grande from Starbucks etc.). This place was busy -- a line to the door -- at lunchtime. Many people in business attire. Many older folks grabbing lunch with friends or take-out. Lots of take-out going on & you can call ahead too and skip the line. My three year-old loved her turkey and cheese wrap with Mandarin oranges on the side. We will certainly be back. Avon really needs more good (& healthy) lunch options so this is a welcome discovery."}
{"text":"Ok this is Krazy, but the tuna salad is so good it didn't taste like tuna salad. No after taste, no fishy taste just a great flavor. I will get it again and again. Make your own pasta salad, loved it!  Greek paste salad was great. Just wish I had put tomatoes and grilled chicken in it. The southwest salad was very good. We will go back!"}
{"text":"Very non-descript location, but the inside is CUTE! Lots of options for salads, wraps, subs, etc. You can build your own, or go with one of several options on the chalkboards above the counter. I ordered Autumn Crunch, but with feta cheese. Had green apple, pecans, onion, feta, apple vinegarette dressing, and craisins.  Very good, and a half portion was PLENTY for lunch.  My sister ordered the Dijion (something or other).  We both subbed things and they were happy to do so, and got it right!  The woman at the counter was extremely helpful and gracious as we read through all the many salad and wrap options.  Should have gotten a pic, they were very beautiful salads! We are not from the area, but happy to have happened upon this place.  (Thanks to some research on YELP!)"}
{"text":"Huge salad menu, but it also includes subs and wraps. A steady stream of customers for take-out and seating. Clean, efficient space for serving their fresh, healthy ingredients. I highly recommend this restaurant for patrons looking for something besides the usual burger and fries!"}
{"text":"Had the bbq  pulled chicken wrap and the pecan Dijon salad....everthing was great with generous portions .  The staff was great and friendly.  Will be back again and again ."}
{"text":"This has become one of my favorites. I have been here for lunch, dinner, and tried their catering. My clients were as impressed as I have been by the food. Ordering and price up were very easy. They get very busy, but handle the crowd well most of the time."}
{"text":"I've eaten here enough times to say there food is good but it's so frustrating because they always get my order wrong"}
{"text":"They have some great menu items - but the staff isn't very friendly. Plus the signage isn't very good. I called ahead to pick up an order and when I got there, there was line. I stood in the line to be courteous to other patrons, until someone walked in, and cut the line to pick up their food. Apparently if you have a pick up, you can do that. I had no idea. A sign might be a good idea..."}
{"text":"Delicious healthy food. Huge menu so lots of great choices to choose from. Wish there was more seating inside. Can't wait to visit again."}
{"text":"Came here while visiting family in Avon Lake and I was looking for a healthy alternative to the fast food junk. I ordered a club sandwich (not the healthiest, but not McDonald's!) It's your standard sub, but I enjoyed the flavors. I saw a lot of reviews regarding the speed of service, my food came out quick! Their salads looked amazing. I would come back here if we lived in AL!"}
{"text":"I love this place!!!  I could eat here everyday and never get bored of the food or the smoothies.  Healthy options and friendly staff.  Great choices on the menu and a lot of variety.  AWESOME soups!  Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"From the outside you would never guess such a place existed. Huge menu with lots of options. Cool idea is any salad can be a wrap and vice versa. Pasta can be added to your salad. I have gotten so many ideas for my at home salads just coming here. There are soups, smoothies other options too. The inside was clean and open. The service was friendly, patience and quick. Also very clean where they make the food. I usually eat inside but you can order to go and it's quick and painless. Great local place with affordable fresh food."}
{"text":"I met the owner today. Great guy. 

Today I ordered the \"5 Alarm\" wrap on tomato basil and it was nothing less than amazing!! Absolutely delicious! I highly recommend this from the signature wrap menu. From the salads menu I would highly recommend the Pecan Dijon or the Baja salad depending which ingredients you're Kraving that day. You'll be happy with any of those. So many more menu items I haven't even tried yet. Their menu is pretty big with a lot of great options. Anybody could find a favorite here!"}
{"text":"How anyone can give this place anything other than a 5 star rating is beyond me. 

The salads are out of this world amazing. Especially the Cheesy BLT! OMG! Heavenly! 

I literally could eat here daily! 
Just leave the one guy out of there that was going through their garbage after eating a salad. Very uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Update 5/1/2018-- thank you Salad Kraze for adding recycle containers!! 

Delicious food! We eat here about 3 times per week. I highly recommend the veggie pizza wrap! Soups are delicious and my husband loves the Baja salad! Absolutely the best place to get healthy fast food options! 

I have only a few criticisms. Usually my husband and I walk in around 7:45 or 8 pm. The restaurant closes at 9 and every time we express that we will dine in we are reminded that \"we close in an hour.\" It makes us feel unwelcome and rushed. I totally understand if it's like 8:30 or 8:45 pm when we walk in, but not when closing time is over an hour away. If they want to close at 8:30 pm then they need to change their hours. 

My second suggestion is that I wish they would have an option to recycle the salad containers. The food is served in these beautiful green hard plastic containers and I hate throwing it away knowing it isn't being recycled. I feel like it's an easy fix to help the environment or they can consider serving in biodegradable containers... it would probably be cheaper too!"}
{"text":"I tried Salad Kraze today for the first time with a colleague while out that way for a meeting. The place is cute on the inside and they were very quick to wait on us. I made a build your own salad and was impressive by the portion size. I liked that I could mix greens with pasta. Additionally, there was such a variety of toppings. 

I picked a base of romaine and whole wheat rotini with chicken, apples, pears, mandarin oranges and grapes. I enjoyed the salad but have two small gripes. First, the grapes were huge and thus had really large seeds in them. And second, the chicken was your typical out of a bag, already cooked chicken, I would have loved it if it was a bit better quality and had better taste. 

I'd visit again, but would skip the chicken and grapes."}
{"text":"I could eat from here every single day!! 

I like being able to call in an order while I'm driving home from work, stopping in grabbing the delicious food and getting on my way. I am creature of habit usually, so I stick to what I know I like. And I know I LOVE the Autumn Crunch Salad. That Apple Vinaigrette dressing is out of this world! I love how simple the salad is and how delicious it is. I've also tried the Garden Of Eaten which was good as well. My husband always goes for the wraps, usually the buffalo chicken wrap, and he loves  them. 

Great location, great food and quick service!"}
{"text":"Fresh salads are a guarantee here. My husband and I have been here several times. Honestly the wait was a little long but it was so worth it. And we did go at dinner time each time we went. My salad container was packed. They really give you a lot of food for your money. I wish that they had nutrition info for this restaurant that would make it even better. But you can definitely eat healthy here."}
{"text":"My husband and I grab lunch here usually once a week.  I have to admit, the very first time I tried Salad Kraze a couple years or so ago, I wasn't too crazy about the salad I chose.  But I think that was a personal choice (I didn't care for the dressing).  I didn't go back for a while but am glad I decided to give them another try.  The soups are amazing (I particularly love their bean and sausage soup), and all the salad ingredients are fresh.  Their ranch dressing is fantastic.  I have yet to try their wraps or smoothies but am promising myself I will next time I go.  I usually try a different salad each time, my husband always does the build-it-yourself salad.  Happy to see a local mom and pop place so successful.  As far as others stating the staff isn't friendly, that may be people that used to work there - we find everyone very friendly."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. This salad place offers great variety of salads, wraps, subs, and soups. I am not familiar with the Avon lake area, but from what I have seen, this place is a much needed break from its neighboring fast food franchises down the road. The \"small\" size salad was actually rather large and filling. I bet the large could feed two easily. I ordered the Alaskan salmon salad. Good distribution of all toppings so each bite delivered the flavored that was promised. And this place is cheap too! My small Alaskan salad was $7. Staff are very friendly and service very quick. I ordered my salad to go and it was very good!  Definitely stop by for a healthier alternative! And smoothies are offered here too."}
{"text":"I have been going here since they first opened up ! Love this place and never had a bad experience . Its such a great place . Salad and all their ingredients are always super fresh and tasty . They have every ingredient and combination that can be imagined.

Soups are to die for and always made from scratch . 

Great place to go when you want a fresh and healthy meal . 

Recommend to all"}
{"text":"The soup here is off the hook.  It's beautiful.  I've tried several of their varieties, and in each, the broth was rich and flavorful and each was full of \"stuff\".  You won't run out of veggies/meat/noodles before you run out of soup.

This isn't a salad bar.  Everything is prepared for you and nicely presented. Yay!"}
{"text":"The worst thing about this place is that it isn't close enough to me.  Why can't the Greek salad move in next door? We could be friends.  It could ask to borrow sugar, and I'd ask to borrow feta, lettuce, dressing, tomatoes, cucumbers, chicken, and yummmmmmm.

Sorry, where was I?

Sometimes, all you need a salad.  Sometimes all you need is a good salad place.  I'm okay if there's a chain of them, I'd visit them.  Bring one to the east side."}
{"text":"This place is so good!! I love their variety of salad options and also subs/wraps. The garden of Eaton salad with romaine, spring mix, red grapes, dried cranberries, pears, pistachios, feta & pear gorgenzola dressing is my fav! Great lunch/dinner spot."}
{"text":"This place has amazing salads and even better soups. You don't get better than this. Definitely the type of gem u usually only find in a big city.   At these prices it's worth trying for your self!

They seem to be very up with the times, I'll be on the lookout for them on GroupOn"}
{"text":"Salad KraZe is doing quite well for itself and I can see why.  Everytime I've stepped foot inside, they've been busy, even just an hour before closing!  The inside is very clean and modern and the decor looks great! Props to the interior design team!
Stop in and walk up to the counter to order and your food will be ready to pick up in minutes.  The young ladies are very friendly and seem to enjoy working there. They have plenty of seating inside since they expanded with a remodel a few years ago.  The parking lot is on the small side considering they're located in a little plaza shared by a few other small businesses, but it's ok.

Their big selection of freshly made healthy salads never disappoint. They definitely don't skimp on the portions or the quality of ingredients and their dressings are homemade and delicious!  
My favorite salad is probably the Alaskan Salmon salad...packed with protein and omega 3s...perfect for a postworkout meal! It's made with baby spinach, WILD Alaskan Salmon, an assortment of other crisp, tasty veggies, sunflower seeds, feta cheese, and a side of zesty balsamic vinaigrette.  My second favorite is probably the good ole Cobb Salad...turkey, egg, bacon, avocado, crisp romaine, tangy Bleu cheese dressing...need I say more?

In addition to salads, they offer some great wraps, subs, homemade soups, and tasty smoothies!

The wraps are available with a choice of 4 different tortillas: white, wheat, spinach, or tomato-basil. Although the wraps are good and flavorful, they tend to use a little too much cheese in them for my taste. It's maybe 40/60 cheese to remaining ingredients. Any wrap can be ordered as a sub too, but I had one once and wasn't that impressed. The bread was on the small side and just wasn't that impressive.  You seemed to get more food with a wrap. Maybe they'll change the bread and I'll give it another shot, but until then, I'll pass. Wraps and subs come with a bag of chips or a side of fresh cut apple.

The smoothies are really refreshing! They're freshly blended in the Vitamix while you wait and come in 4 tantalizing flavors and two sizes. A perfect pick-me-up any time of day.

I haven't tried any of their soups yet, but this Fall seems like an opportune time!

Stop by and check out SaladKraze for a freshly made, healthy meal!  Oh, and they offer delivery and catering as well!"}
{"text":"As always my favorite choice for lunch!!  Would be for dinner too if I lived closer!  One other nice thing about this place is that they continue to strive for quality and satisfaction!!  I have seen other places fail because they slack off after they are open for a while.  Not here.... Great place to eat!"}
{"text":"I usually love this place.  However they may be the next victim of a good place going bad.  Tonight we ordered two salads to go and the first had rotting pieces of salad (and at a salad place to you should never receive this).  On the second salad, the pieces were so large that I had to re-cut the pieces of lettuce so I don't choke. (One may say that's a given that you have to cut your food...well okay I guess.  But this is the first time I've had to and also they included only forks (not knives) on A to go order.)  So I would say it's just a bad night.  

The kicker is that while I came in to the restaurant at about 7 minutes till 8pm close time.  One of the older ladies looked frustrated/disgusted that I was there and asked others to \"take care of it\" which I'm assuming meant lock the doors or turn the sign off to show closed because the next phone call that came in at 7:57 according to my phone clock was \"Salad Kraze, we are closed!\"

Im not in a hurry tango back or recommend.  I guess i will eventually but when I get a bad experience for my cash, it makes me think of other places that are always consistent."}
