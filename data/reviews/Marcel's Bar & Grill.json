{"text":"Marcel's has the best staff and owner in the area. Mercedes coming home was a blessing. All the girls are great. Exceptional value on drinks and food. Great neighborhood bar and they open at 10 for anyone who likes Little Big Town's DAY DRINKING.

{"text":"My wife and I walk down to this place sometimes.  It's a good neighborhood bar with good food and good prices  We went for their kareoke one night and had a fun time.  good hang out spot for good for watching  sports."}
{"text":"This place sucks.  There no other way to say it.  Dirty, smelly and dark.  Staff think they are doing you a favor."}
{"text":"A great place to have a beer and relax! The staff is extremely friendly!"}
{"text":"Went last night with the wife for a few drinks to avoid hitting up any of the usual places. Definitely one of the local dive bars.... not always a bad thing though. No doubt, the place is dated, not the cleanest establishment I have ever beveragated in, and the locals were, um, rough. But dammit it was cheap drinks and sometimes you want a good local dive bar for that very reason- cheap booze and good people watching. 

I can't really speak for the food, we ordered fried mushrooms and chips & salsa and they were exactly what I was expecting- not good, but exactly what I was expecting. Can't speak for the bathroom cause I chose to hold it, but the wife went and came out in one piece so I am sure she has lived through worse. 

All things said and done, we ordered aforementioned shrooms and chips & salsa, I had 4 Fat Tires, the wife had 4 (yes 4!) vodka tonics and for the hell of it we did 4 (weak) Kamikaze shots and the bill was $58- I rest my case!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite dive bars! I go either on a Friday or Saturday night for karaoke. Jack, the KJ is very friendly as well as most of the staff. I have no idea what the other reviewers here are talking about when they say the rest rooms are dirty. Not once in the 4 years I have been going there have I seen it a mess. There was no paper strewn everywhere, and for a dive bar they have potty protectors and automatic toilets! Rare!
The food is o.k nothing fab. But not bad either. It's inexpensive bar food. But they do have a steak special for 6.99 on the weekend. They re modeled the place. Inside is nothing special but they did add a nice patio with tables and chairs and misters. Marcels attracts a late night crowd. The place can get very busy after 11pm. The regulars here are nice working class folks. A mixture of professionals and blue collar workers. Along with your biker chicks and ladies that have designer handbags and shoes. Young and old. I love the place. What makes it divey is that it's small and dark. Not the neighborhood. I have seen rougher clientele at Brigette's Last Laugh and I like that place as well. But Marcel's has my vote on where I like to hang out with friends and just drink and sing!
Edit: 6/11/11: Brad is now the karaoke host. He by far exceeds my expectations. He has the best karaoke system in the valley and best song list. He does not play favorites and is FAIR in his rotation. We have been a regular at this place for years now. The bartenders and servers are wonderful. The food is just ok. Bar food what do you expect? But they usually have a special going on. I love this bar."}
{"text":"This place sucks. Do yourself a favor and avoid at all costs. 
The karaoke DJ sings more than the customers and won't give up \"his turn\" for customers. 
The servers are terrible and act like they're not Bartending at a slime bar located in a strip mall. 
The bathrooms are gross. 
I wish there were a way to rate less than a 1 star because I would love to rate this place a zero."}
{"text":"Hopefully you don't get Jenny! She has cut everyone off in our party when they just ask for a drink. Bar is great but ever since she has started there no one likes it! Bitch sucks!"}
{"text":"Best karaoke place ever! Staff will super take care of you!"}
{"text":"I have been going here for over 10 yrs, seen the place remodeled 3-4 times, and 3 karaoke hosts.....I love the neighborhood feel of the bar the friendly and surly staff, the atmosphere is what it is a BAR and GRILL decent food decent prices and fun in the air, Sherry and Misty the bartenders i see most are awesome and have been there forever, they remeber and care greatly for their regulars and try to make new ones quick, but the Crown Jewel of this place is Wed-Sat nights, KARAOKE BY BRAD, He has been here for past 3 years and continues to have the newest music available for the group of singers, No favoritism here he has alot of regulars but no one gets preference in line up, and you always know whos up next by the TV screens that show the next 4-6 in the line up, his sound sytem and professionalism is superior my wife is a Karaoke Junkie and loves this place \"The Shellie Show\"...  Also Happy Hour here is great too LOW prices on Domestics 11-7 daily   yes 11-7 ....  Stop by  I did still going since 2001"}
{"text":"Their kitchen closes way too early !  
Lay-out of the whole place isnt good and needs to be improved.
There simply is something wrong with the over-all lay-out of Marcel's that doesnt make you feel at home. 
                         Rest rooms arent maintained. Always strewn with paper all over. Everything inside is Boring and DULL!
The place needs MAJOR MAJOR SURGERY!
My guess is the business is probably out for sale. To say this place sucks is an understatement!"}
{"text":"Always wanted to try this place out, and was finally able to today!  I have to say I was pleasantly surprised as to how clean it was and how friendly the bartender, Laura  Was. 
I would of given 5 stars, except for the fact that it is the end of June and 110 outside, and when we asked for the misters to be turned on, we were told that she couldn't because they were on a timer that came on at night. Makes no sense to me at all, since I've worked in the industry for many many years and I know you can override the mister systems, and why wouldn't you want to have your daytime guests be as comfortable as your night time guests????  
If the owner was able to change this ridiculous rule, I would be more than happy to give it more stars!!"}
{"text":"Great local bar.  Good food and good prices.  I stop here for happy hour on the way home 2-3 times a month.  All the bartenders are very friendly and very attentive to the customers no matter how busy they are.

Looking forward to the football season so I can stop in and watch my Vikings every once in awhile since they have the NFL Sunday Ticket!"}
{"text":"Really disappointed in this place. I've been going here off and on for a few years and I feel that it's went way downhill. The bartenders used to be really great and the bartenders in there now are terrible. They make terrible drinks, if you drink mixed drinks and I find the bartenders incredibly rude at times.
Many people go in there to sing karaoke and when there is a big line-up to sing, the karaoke guy always tends to keep himself inserted in the line-up. Personally, the karaoke guy should remove himself if there are more then 5-7 people already singing. Karaoke is for the customers and not for the karaoke host.
As far as the food, the food is actually pretty good.
I'm just disappointed in this place, considering how it used to be years ago. Hopefully they'll change some things and get it back to where it used to be. 

UPDATE...... I'm updating my review from a three star to a four star review. They added fresh booths in Marcels and they changed all of the bartenders and servers. Well done!!!! The service is incredibly better. The changes are very nice to see. Great job!!! Thank you!!!!"}
{"text":"Normally this place isn't too bad for a hole-in-the-wall type place. The server named Rebecca is out of control and rude. My husband and I went there with another couple and Rebecca was anything but attentive to our table. We had to go up to the bar multiple times to ask for our drinks to be refilled, to give our food order and for the check (which I thought was strange because he was giving 2 other tables, table side service). Anyway, we asked for split checks (my husband and myself and then the other couple on another). She brought out a hand written slip with totals on them. Not itemized just totaled. So I simply requested an itemized receipt and she lost her mid. She snatched the checks from my husbands hand and asked why I needed it that way. She leaves and comes back with the same receipts and and says I'm sorry yours is 3 dollars less. I told her I didn't care about the price I still wanted an itemized receipt showing the items I was paying for. Yet again.... She snatched them from my hands leaves and comes back with the original totals on the same freaking receipts and says with attitude, \"this is the total due\". It was the original price and still not itemized. I was so annoyed that she couldn't just give me an itemized receipt like ANY other establishment would give. I hand her money and go sit down. Rebecca had the audacity to walk up to my table and put her hands on her hips and ask me what my problem was and why I was questioning her. I got so mad and told her that she should have a good night and I tried to exit the establishment but she stood in front of my husband on the booth so he couldn't get out and asked again what my problem was. After requesting for her to move about 3 times we leave and walk out to our car, darling Rebecca walks out on the patio and tells the previous bartender with brunette hair that I was and I quote. \"A bitch\" and saying all kinds of other ridiculousness. I will never return. She is a shitty server who obviously works at this kind of place at 45 years old because she has ZERO customer service skills. Way to go Rebecca!!!"}
{"text":"Meh. I've experienced better."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place and Saturday night karaoke.  I've been coming here for years and it's always fun.  Decently priced drinks, friendly staff and fun crowds are a Saturday standard!   The only bad thing I would have to say which takes off a star is the bar could be a little darker, and in the summer it gets a little warm inside. 

Definitely a great place to grab a drink at any time of day and to meet up with the friends for a drink."}
{"text":"Was blown away by the rude bartender on a Saturday night.  She refused to serve me because she claimed my driver's license didn't have the correct height.  I then offered her my military ID which she threw at me and told me to leave.  I understand it is always up to the bartender however I was completely disheartened she would literally throw my drivers license and military ID at me.  I am not so offended now that I am hearing she is the manager and has had numerous complaints about her attitude.  I would only consider going back after an apology and if they fire her however I hear it is about to close (perhaps because of her poor attitude) so that is enough for me."}
{"text":"Best dj ever for karaoke! ! 1 stars because their waitresses are rude!!! Jenny wouldn't serve me because I looked grumpy when I asked for a drink."}
{"text":"Friendly bar, people, good fair priced food and all the Football Games all weekend long!!!"}
{"text":"We love this place. Brad is the best karaoke DJ. Up to date music! Gives everyone an opportunity to sing no matter how terrible we sound. 
We also love Sherry. She makes great drinks and is so nice she's the best!"}
{"text":"Be very weary of this place if you are not a local.  We have been twice for karaoke and both times left very disappointed.  While I value a server for being cautious to overserve there is a limit.  The latest time we went I joined 3 of my friends for some fun and silly drinks and karaoke.  I have never been so fearful in my life to have 2 beers in a 3 hours times as the server kept asking who was driving home (no one in our party was drinking excessively).  Finally after the third comment my friend (who is a manager at a restaurant in the valley) complained to the person behind the bar who was apologetic.  Although I do enjoy the DJ and karaoke I won't be coming back to this place."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for years and it is now my go-to neighborhood bar.  Food is great, they have free poker and Casey is the best karoake host!  Staff is very friendly and they have darts, pool and a internet jukebox.   If you go, look for the good-looking guy at the bar and say, \"Hi.\""}
{"text":"Its a bar. The beer is cold, the shots are stiff and the prices are good. The bartender is quick and they offer karioke for you singers and bar games for everyone else. Its a pretty cool place to go and throw one back after a hard day work or a good place to start of your night."}
{"text":"OMG so lets chat. Kind of uncomfortable... TV were inconsiderately placed in such positions that made it difficult to watch the game from the BAR. And 2 industrial fans were blowing directly in one area,  I had to actually get up and turn one down because having them on was soooo unnecessary. Smh its just another dive spot. Needs new layout and design."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Marcel's last night, overall the atmosphere was nice, everyone was friendly and the waitress was very tentative and nice. We even played in a Texas Holden tournament and had a great time. I would highly recommend this place. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Great food and simple and fast rotation for karaoke compared to most of the places out there."}
{"text":"Just a fun light hearted friendly neighborhood pub.  Getting to know more and people here. Everyone is just friendly salt of the earth people."}
{"text":"It's good cheap drinks with a laid back crowd. Full of regulars. It's nothing fancy but we live close enough to walk. It's a great place to drink it up out of the house for cheap."}
{"text":"Simple bar. I would call it a dive bar. I had an hour to kill and this place is where I landed. Friendly but not fake acting bartender that provided good service. Very limited lunch menu, chicken fingers were the most substantial food available. Seems to have a group of regulars that stuck together but did not seem judgemental. They have a smoking patio. Overall a pretty good experience."}
{"text":"Three stars people? Come on! What are you looking for out of your neighborhood pub exactly? As for my part, I enjoy an awesome jukebox, excellent food, friendly service, affordable drinks, some of the best regulars you'll find anywhere and a Beautiful/Supersweet Barmaid like MEL .... so this place gets five stars from me."}
{"text":"Marcels is a diamond in the rough.  While I'm not a huge fan of the staff there, the karaoke is awesome!  The host, Brad, is really friendly and even throws in little contests to win free drinks!  I really like the atmosphere there, the restrooms are clean.  I have spent many hours on the patio as well which was really nice!  Its pretty inexpensive there, too.  I haven't had the food there yet.  I do enjoy the eclectic mix of people that go to Marcels - young, old, white collar and blue collar.  They don't mind us squishing our tables together every time we go, as we usually  bring quite a crowd with us.  For a great time, see you at Marcels!"}
{"text":"Been going here for about 6 months now. A great, local bar. Friendly regulars, good prices and good food. The fact that I could crawl home from here is also a plus. :-)"}
{"text":"This place is worth coming to if for nothing more than the amazing bartender, Elisha. She remembers your name and order. She has a steel trap memory and it's like coming to cheers! Highly recommended. Drink specials change but there are some every night."}
{"text":"Yeah, doubt I'll be back. Been there once before, but not my favorite. It's your local dive bar with below average greasy food and in a dire need for an update, including new bar stools which is the only seating they have."}
{"text":"The bar tenders and waitresses are awesome  here.  If you are looking for a classy place this is not where you want to go.  If you are looking for a place where everyone knows your name with great staff, decent food at a good price, and decent priced good drinks this is a place to go."}
{"text":"marcels is a nice lil bar off to the side in front of the des office near paradise valley community college i went there one night to do karaoke with casey who is an amazing singer and host kicked it off i had a great time the angry orchard on tap which i can appreciate also the only complaint is the people playing poker like to take up to much space we had to wait for them to move we didn't get to start karaoke to 10 granted it was only a few of us i like to get in 5 songs or more because i love to sing"}
{"text":"I think this place was okay the time I went.  The Nachos weren't the greatest though.  They were 7-11 cheese sauce nachos instead of real cheese.  Some drunk Irish guy kept asking me the same question over and over again, reminded me of 10 Second Tom.  The karaoke host was nice and they have a good selection of songs.  As for people commenting on the bathrooms and decor, it's a dive bar.  If you want nice go to Blue Martini.

I'm upping my previous review one star because this place really does have a great karaoke host and I love how they show you on the TVs who the next 5 peopls singing are so you know when it's your turn.  Also, it's never too crowded so you can always get tons of songs in."}
{"text":"I have been going to Marcels for a year now and I absolutely love it there.. Casey (the karaoke host) is amazing!! I mostly go on Saturday nights. They have a dart boards and a pool table to keep you busy why you are waiting to see.. Jamie is usually my server and remembers me every time! If you wanna have fun and sing this is a place to go. They have great choices for songs!!"}
{"text":"We don't live in the area, but girlfriend and I saw a Groupon offer, so we thought we'd give it a shot.  We pull up to see only 3 cars in the lot on a Saturday night at 730p and thought it would be awful. We could not have been more wrong. Great service and fantastic burgers. Beer was cheap and cold."}
