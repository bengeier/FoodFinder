{"text":"Cafe blanco is awesome! The staff is very friendly and upbeat. There is a comfy couch and two comfy chairs that I fancy. They play a very nice mix of music there. The coffee is about a dollar cheaper than chain coffee and 100% better. Cheaper, Better, Faster, Stronger... seriously! The large has three shots not two and the when you add the whip cream you come up with a coffee that you have to savor! This is my favorite coffee shop in Phoenix. Mucho Recomendo!"}
{"text":"I'm writing this review as I sit in Lola, sipping on a cappuccino, so you know they have free WIFI.  This review isn't about the WIFI. You also know they have coffee, since \"Coffee\" is in their name, and it's a caf√©.  This review isn't about that either.

This is about the quiche.

Actually, it's about all the pastries, since they're all made by the same unfathomably talented pastry chef, but it's the quiche that, every time I have it, makes me wonder, \"If this is quiche, what's that stuff I ate every other time I ordered quiche?\"  It's light. Just ... just so, so light, and fluffy. The crust is crispy and light and buttery. And it costs far less than inferior quiche at other places (about $4, I think).

But the five stars I gave it aren't just for the quiche, or the rest of the amazing pastries.  This place just does everything right: the location is in a beautiful, historic location; they have a terrific selection of loose-leaf tea; the atmosphere is cool, with worn concrete floors, a high ceiling, and vintage furniture; the staff is friendly, and acts like a family; and a vintage Bang & Olufsen stereo playing music that is far too cool for me to identify it.  Oh, and the coffee is great."}
{"text":"Best mocha in town. The Matador is hands down one amazing drink! The vibe is great and food is good as well. Definitely on my rotation now when I'm in the downtown area."}
{"text":"Lola Coffee is definitely my favorite downtown coffee shop.  The service is always quick and friendly, and they always make my drink exactly how I like it without asking.  They just seem to do it right, each and every time.  There's always something delicious waiting for you in the baked good section, and if you're lucky enough to catch the cherry rice pudding, you're luckier than I've been in several months.  The coffee might just be the strongest in town (and it still tastes great) - I've always got the good-shakes for a while after I visit."}
{"text":"Despite living near Fair Trade Cafe for 2 years, this has become MY coffee shop.  

Coffee:
The Matador is a great \"signature\" drink.  Their lattes are pretty good, if not typically as memorable as Giant Coffee's.  The Americano here is much better than other places nearby, in my experience.

Food:
Holy cow!  The baked goods are Lola are enough to make me skip breakfast and just head here.  I really dig the randomness of never knowing what they will make, and have never been disappointed when I've tried a new variation on something.  

Atmosphere & Service:
The atmosphere and the service are what makes me come here over any other coffee shop near Roosevelt.  Lisa and the rest of the staff have always given me excellent service, even when I show up at the last minute.  Great service, a greeting when I show up, and a personal touch make me feel much more welcome here than at other nearby places.  Plus, the lighting is great; I love to start my day off by grabbing coffee and catching up on the news/twitter from here, and I really dig the \"refurbished\" or \"repurposed\" feel to the furnishing here.  The school chairs, the well-worked white table, the door-as-a-menu, the exposed brick, and the great speakers in the corner all give the place a great, lived in, texture.

Shoot, I've mentioned this place 6 times on my blog in the last year (http://www.relevantwit.com/?s=lola).  I'm pretty clear I'm addicted."}
{"text":"I will echo the reviews below. Amazing friendly service. I got the egg white omelet w/ bacon, spinach, & tomatoes. A little over priced but you do get a large portion size. I also got the cafe latte which was very good. I would recommend this to all!"}
{"text":"This is a really nice place. Went here for the first time the other afternoon and loved it. Delicious coffee (I got the matador) and nice atmosphere. I would definitely come here to work or read. Great window seating and various styles of indoor seating (low tables, high tables, couches, etc.) Little $ but was worth it if you are looking for a good quality coffee. Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Good coffee, sometimes a little burnt. Pastries great."}
{"text":"Lola Coffee is a cute unique place. I loved the fact that this place is pet friendly. I brought my baby pug with me, and we were more than welcomed. The coffee tastes perfect, wonderful blend. Chocolate croissant is a total guilty pleasure.... mmmm. Staff is friendly and helpful.
I am giving 4 stars because parking situation is tough (better to take Uber)."}
{"text":"Tea selection leaves more to be desired, but its given in a teapot, which gives it an extra plus :).

The place is super cute, but if you're coming to work, know that there aren't outlets for plugging laptops in"}
{"text":"This is the best coffee shop I have been to in Arizona. I normally get the hot caramel latte's! Very good choice if you don't know what get. There is a pretty good amount of space and tables for you to do your work out while drinking your coffee."}
{"text":"First of all, I'm glad that Lola moved in to this space. I miss Calabria, but I'm glad something worthy has taken over this spot that serves delectable things.

Thanks to Chef Danielle (formerly of Sweet Pea Bakery), Lola's baked goods are worth dreaming about. If you ever find macarons (perhaps this is the French spelling?), then you have to purchase one or two because those things are to die for.

I like the ambiance, I like the staff and people who frequent it. It's a good crowd, mostly on their laptops or busy reading their books or newspapers.

Here's my one and only complaint: They don't make their drip coffee hot enough.

I'm a simple gal. I don't ask for those mocha, macchiato, extra foam, skinny-skinny, with drizzle and powder on top kinda drinks. I just want simple brewed coffee with some room for my cream.

The first time I purchased coffee at Lola's, it was served in a cup because I chose to drink it there. And it was already lukewarm, therefore, it was \"iced\" coffee by the time I had my second sip. The next time, I asked for it in a to-go cup, thinking that the lid might keep the coffee warmer longer. Alas, the drip coffee was lukewarm after my third sip. The last time I was there (3 days ago), I asked for them to put in a to-go cup again and to make it a little hotter than usual. Oh, it was hot alright, but maybe just 2 notches above their usual \"warm.\"

I'm not looking for scalding coffee but just hot enough for me to enjoy hot coffee a little longer while reading the Arts section of the Arizona Republic (and there's really not much content in that section).

Can't a girl ever get hot coffee from there? That's all she asks."}
{"text":"Absolutely love Lola. The best coffee in PHX. Everyone that works at lola is so nice without being over the top. They always are friendly to greet. The drinks are always perfect--makes you feel totally ok spending 5 dollars on a coffee drink. Blueberry scones are spot on! My sister requests I bring these to CA every time I visit..they're that good. The coffee and espresso at Lola is just perfect and delicious. Keep coming back :)"}
{"text":"Lola, on Roosevelt, is my favorite coffee shop in the Valley. They roast their beans on location and the quality of the coffee is superb. Jency and Lisa are the best baristas; always friendly, even if the last patron is the largest bitch or Richard. The tables and chairs are solid and comfortable; totally put Lux's lawn chairs to shame. And, lastly, if you are craving a treat with your beverage, they have the best baked goods. Overall, I don't any other place for coffee where they know your name, your drink and how to make your day."}
{"text":"Great coffee. Even more amazing soy chai.

The back patio is a great place to read for a little while in a sunny afternoon.

Also directly connected to Pita Jungle, so...win win. :D"}
{"text":"In the midst of the great emptiness that is the depraved Phoenix aesthetic, Lola gives me hope that--someday--the people of this valley will awake from their masochistic delirium and create spaces consonant with our humanity. Until then, I'll be holed up at Lola."}
{"text":"I like Lolas coffee it tastes good and it's hot. And their food is tasty. And Jensey is a really friendly gal who works there. I wish all places that I go to have friendly people like her. 
I wish Lola's had more comfortable chairs there to sit on. I love the fact that they have an antique looking record player that plays a fun selection of eclectic music. And it's not blaring to the point that you can't hear yourself think. I have been to other coffee places in town and I can't even hear myself think at all. I mean really. Other than that I enjoy going there for coffee, food and friendly staff."}
{"text":"This is a great place to chill and have a great cup of coffee. The great pastries are freshly baked and the coffee beans are roasted every morning. The staff is friendly and make a real effort to remember your name. The decor is cool and they feature artwork by local artists.
I took one star away because they close at 7 during the week and at 2 on Sundays. Other than that, it's a great coffee shop."}
{"text":"Urgh...I keep trying this place but it's seemingly impossible (like at Lux on Central) to have a quiet coffee time. Music is, in my view (maybe I'm getting too old) always louder than necessary. To add to the cacophony today the staff were playing around w/ each other for some reason and all sorts of squealing that made it pretty much impossible to relax. Tea is good and scone was delicious but the atmosphere could be WAY more relaxing."}
{"text":"Lola's is my favorite spot for coffee, breakfast and just hanging out.  Very comfortable interior and seating on the front sidewalk and rear patio when the weather is good (which is most of the year).  My favorite things to order are the iced latte, brownie and the chocolate cake - okay those last two I order infrequently and only as a special treat.  For breakfast, their pastries and quiche really can't be beat.  We just recently relocated to the Roosevelt neighborhood and having Lola's in close proximity was a major draw because I always have a great place to meet up with people or visit with friends."}
{"text":"Great coffee, fantastic pastries. Love the omellette bar."}
{"text":"Been on my quest for looking for a new spot to study; wow that sounded NERDY! Please don't judge, eh to late. Despite reading all the reviews and getting lost trying to find this place, embarrassing I know. As mentioned by various Yelper's their Matador beverage was EPIC. I went there around 1ish even on Spring Break this place was busy. The atmosphere to subtle, their music wasn't overly loud, good tunes. Overall I recommend this place."}
{"text":"Cute and cozy! My breakfast was better than anticipated! The coffee was not your ordinary coffee, lots of flavor and richness!"}
{"text":"Try the cafe blanco! It's divine. This place is a gem, highly recommend you visit. Pastry selection is yummy, and includes vegan items.  The space is comfortable and creative, perfect for studying or working."}
{"text":"Good coffee and very consistant quality. The staff is friendly and always fun to chat with. The only negative is that it isn't within walking distance from my office! Oh well, still worth the drive."}
{"text":"An awesome hang out for a nice latte and delicious pastries. Listen to some samba music and lay back. They have a nice outdoor seating also. If you are looking for a place to chill in the downtown area, this cafe is probably one of the nicest in the downtown area."}
{"text":"Been coming here for past 6 months.  And I have not looked for any other coffee joints.  Coffee is superb!  I love it here, the owner definitely has passion and great taste."}
{"text":"Good Coffee, Friendly service for the most part
Haven;t tried their food yet, but the baked goods are BOMB. 

Check it out if you are on the west side of downtown. 


weird hours
don't open until seven."}
{"text":"Lola has the best vanilla iced coffee in Phoenix, hands down! Whenever I am downtown I make it a point to stop by. The taste of their coffee is consistent. The outside patio is beautiful. I definitely recommended stopping by!"}
{"text":"Worst watered down espresso I have ever had. And that was $3.50 .
Checked Yelp later, it was supposed to be closed at 7, I was there at 7:10. Would have been ok if they said they were closed and saved me some $$."}
{"text":"I used to live a stone's throw from this place, and I miss my early morning walks here for the perfect Americano. 

It's small, kind of cutely cluttered, and the perfect place to get some work done in the afternoon when it quiets down a bit. 

Get an Americano, or an Arnold Palmer with green tea and their house-made lemonade. You will not regret it."}
{"text":"Was there for breakfast during which was a big line so when I was ordering the cashier pushed through to get everybody. I wasn't finished and she took my payment, one of the things I wanted to ask was the cost for bottled spring water but instead got shocked with $18.00 for cup of black coffee, breakfast sandwich and the bottled spring water. Did not get a receipt or offered, had to go back in line to ask for it and not itemized. The coffee tasted very very good so after finishing I went to get refill (which by the way the cup here are small and cute and cost $2.50 for it!!!) Told the girl to leave room for cream and sugar completley disregarded me filling it to the top and than telling me $.50 for refill!!! I was appalled! I do NOT recommend this place, terrible prices, cattle service."}
{"text":"Coffee was good and Raspberry muffin was great. Back patio area was a great spot to enjoy."}
{"text":"I am writing this review for a missed jewel in the Lola family which is LOLA tapas.  I have seen so many reviews on yelp where people will throw 5 stars at anything.  Lola tapas is one restaurant that is worthy of a 5 star rating.  Too bad it closed.  Please consider reopening lola tapas and you honestly had the best food in town!"}
{"text":"Lola's lattes taste like espresso, not the overly milky imitations that so many places serve. They're quick and friendly, too! Lola also features the best chocolate chip cookies I've ever tasted. My only complaint is the bathroom - unisex and in need of more regular sprucing. Everything else about the place is welcoming and charming. There's often someone with a cute dog on the patio, and the indoor patrons are all very civilized about sharing the limited space. This is definitely a place worthy of your money."}
{"text":"Lola is my husband and I's Saturday morning routine. It is also the place we went on a date on 8 years ago and I realized he was \"the one,\" so it's a pretty special place for us. We love their coffee -- their cold brew is strong, but smooth.  My husband usually gets a latte, creamy and delicious. I get the most well done almond milk lattes every time. The milk is always the right consistency, people tend to over steam almond milk, but not here. 

I also enjoy the flavors in the matador when I want to branch away from my usual. Can't go wrong here. 

Another high point is their pastry case! The croissants are always so deliciously flakey and buttery (but without being greasy), chocolate chip cookies are delightful. Muffins are always so flavorful and moist.The tortilla espa√±ola is one of my favorite breakfast things, and I do have cravings for it every now and then. 

The baristas are always so friendly and helpful! 

Love this place and so happy Phoenix has it."}
{"text":"Great coffee, great atmosphere!!!!
I can concentrate on my PC work and sketch there!
Very good quality coffee, also great customer service.
I love the interior of the space, too. Very warmth wooden style, big window, and great furniture.

This is the place I go when I am in Phoenix!!!"}
{"text":"This a quaint little place and I really liked their coffee and food! I had a caramel latte and breakfast burrito. Love the atmosphere here, however, it can get pretty busy since it is fairly tiny! Overall, it was a great little place!"}
{"text":"A pretty basic coffee shop. But I do appreciate all the seating! It was a great set up for me and my website designer to meet up."}
{"text":"What a refreshing coffee shop. Quality drinks, friendly service, and a great environment. The Borgia over ice is delectable. Definitely a great find! Enjoy."}
{"text":"LOVE the tart!!!!!! I stopped by after studying in the library. I ordered the blackberry strawberry tart  I also got the matador coffee, not usually a big fan of cinnamon but the amount they put is perfect. It was not overwhelming. Next time I might consider studying here instead."}
{"text":"Beautiful place with beautiful people on a wonderful side of town."}
{"text":"Had the best latte I've had in a very long time here. Late night (6ish), woman barista with darker hair, this last sunday; she made it. Give that woman a raise!! She was extremely nice and is very talented at what she does. Also, the orange and chocolate biscotti was to die for. Good job, Lola's. I'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"I love both locations equally. Such a delicious cafe caramel. I also really love their tea selections. The baristas are always friendly, and there's always a place to sit. What more can you ask for? :)"}
{"text":"The coffee is great. The baked goods are fantastic. However, if you are a decaf person - beware. The last two times I've ordered decaf, I got fully caffeinated coffee. The first time, I didn't notice until it was too late. I had the shakes and sweats for hours after drinking what I thought was decaf. I debated on whether or not to call them to let them know. I did, and they seemed confused as to what I wanted from them. The next trip, after ordering decaf, I asked again when the coffee was ready if the coffee they just handed me was decaf. The answer was, \"Oh, that was supposed to be decaf?\" If you are caffeine-sensitive and love Lola's coffee, just be sure to confirm what they are giving you is indeed what you ordered."}
{"text":"This is my review of the opening night:

I am a huge fan of the other Lola Coffee so when they said they were opening another location I knew I wanted to give it a try.  

I showed up pretty much right at 7pm on opening day Dec. 18 2009.  I went inside and asked if they were taking credit cards on opening night.  They said that they weren't charging on opening night which was very nice.  So I went and ordered my standard double-mocha.  While I was waiting I took in the visuals the new Lola has to offer.  This location seems to have a front of house that is smaller than the Central Ave. location however this is the opposite of a bad thing.  The slightly smaller size lends an intimacy to the place that is very inviting.  It has significantly higher ceilings and the hallway leading out the back door has two cozy and somewhat secluded tables (this would be great if you and your honey wanted to have some quality time together).  The decor is what I would classify as modern with some exposed structural elements in the front of the coffeehouse, a distressed table, and some nice metalwork.  You're also treated to the sight of a coffee bean roaster towards the back of the room.

I got my mocha and, since I was one of the first arrivals, had no problem finding a table (the distressed one).  As I sat sipping my drink and  perusing a book about the Great Barrier Reef I noticed that the place filled with people very quickly.  I ended up talking to an employee of Lola Coffee North (or LoNo as I call it now) for a while.  I then spoke to another woman associated with the business about some of Lola's green features.  It was then time for me to go so I retrieved my bicycle and headed to the nearby Central/Roosevelt light-rail station.

PS: the coffee was very good."}
{"text":"Lola is OUTSTANDING! By far the best coffee, the best baristas, and best atmosphere on the planet."}
{"text":"Lola is still my very favorite local coffee stop. We moved a little further away but that hasn't stopped me from making special trips for my favorite favorite iced coffee (it's perfect!). Parking is tricky depending on the time of day, but honestly no matter where I live in the Valley I will always come to Lola for my World's Greatest Iced Coffee."}
{"text":"I can't review their coffee because the rude salesgirl wouldn't let us buy any. We came here around 7pm on a Friday. The door says they are open until 10. The yelp profile says the same. She was on the phone with a friend gossiping when we came in. We stand there for at least 5mins before she noticed and said \"oh yeah, we're closed.\" wtf?"}
{"text":"Make sure you have a half hour before ordering here! Wow. In an airport and only four in line."}
{"text":"On recommendation from a friend, I recently tried Lolas. He told me to go to the central location, but I was in the area, so I stopped into this one. 

Upon entering, I ordered two drip coffees for my boyfriend and I. The response I got was, \"I'm not brewing anymore drip today.\" Apparently, they close at 7 and 6:15 is too late for coffee in a coffee shop. I then suggested she could make us Cafe Americano's instead. I asked for skim milk in one of them, and in response, a gallon of skim milk was slammed down in front of me. 

As I sat drinking my watered down cafe americano, the barista began sweeping around us. The dirt was flying everywhere. At that moment, I decided we needed to leave. The only thing keeping me from taking a steaming shit on the floor was the 3 cops sitting in the corner of the shop. 

I'd rather get coffee at a shell station. I suggest you do the same."}
{"text":"My coffee was delicious and the ambience of the cafe is nice. They have lots of ports for charging and comfy chairs for naps. The big problem here is customer service. They take way to long to do anything. They also talk to other employees from the airport about things they shouldn't while dropping the f bomb to complain about who I would guess is a manager of some sort. Maybe they forgot that my daughter and I was in the cafe...management needs to step up."}
{"text":"New to the downtown Phoenix area from out of state. I come to Lola Coffee on N. 3rd out of convenience as it's the closest to my apartment in the Roosevelt neighborhood.
People seem to either LOVE this place or HATE it.....I wouldn't say I hate it, but it's not my favorite place either. While the coffee and food selections are quite good, that alone is NOT enough to guarantee a continual loyal customer base.
The customer service here is atrocious-if not non-existent.....getting you through the line as quickly as possible with the least amount of warmth or interest seems to be the goal. On more than 1 occasion I have gotten the wrong quiche order, whipped creme on a drink I specifically said \"no whip\", or wrong size drink I specified.
Would these things have been corrected had I brought the mistake to the attention of the staff? Probably, but it should have been right the first time.....the fact that it has happened more than once says something about their process or my ability to speak clearly.
This location seems more concerned with being edgy and non conformist than providing a stellar customer service experience. I do not feel the staff works cohesively as a group. They each seem DEEPLY focused on what their tasks are, thus resulting in  minimal/no interaction with customers...I say THANK YOU for everything and rarely get a response or acknowledgement here.....it's a busy place for sure, but hopefully not too busy for common courtesy...
Like I said earlier, I come here out of convenance, but a competing coffee giant is opening a few blocks down in a few weeks. I will be going there because the are more organized, have a strict customer service policy and policies in place that ensure a consistent customer experience every visit."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, easy enough to find, and very good coffee. Definitely gonna be one of my new haunts."}
{"text":"Delicious/world class coffee.  The baked goods are SUPERB.  

This cafe reminds me of a place in either Spain or the south of France.  Relaxed and attentive yet very casual, with a strict control of food quality.  Highly recommend. 

If you're new to Phoenix this is a MUST."}
{"text":"I've had a lot of coffee, in a lot of places, and Lola is my all-time favorite.  I love their iced coffee, which is reasonably priced and has a single shot of espresso in it (cheaters).  Also their omelette bar is worth a shot on the weekends for a healthy brunch.  

They usually rotate their art out once a month, supporting the local art scene, and keep lots of local event info around.  Background music is pretty good and non-intrusive, and there are always a few interesting folks around.  

Usually stop by for an iced coffee on the weekend, then buy a bag of locally roasted beans to take home for work-day mornings.  Can't go wrong with the location, or their coffee."}
{"text":"I live between Los Angeles and Phoenix and Lola is by far my favorite coffee shop.  The coffee quality is excellent (I personally love their iced coffees because they add a shot of espresso to them for a full strength and rich flavor), the service is the most efficient and consistent I have ever experienced, the pastry and breakfast items are always fresh and delicious, the prices are reasonable, they sell their brand of coffee and will even grind it for you if you desire, their Arnold Palmers are made from fresh squeezed lemons and the best I've ever had, and I love the feel of the space. I am still searching in LA for my coffee counterpart. I hope Lola decides to open a shop there and make my wildest dreams come true! Thank you, Lola, for being awesome."}
{"text":"I always go here to get some grading done. Their americanos are delicious and the staff is always very friendly! It's a smaller coffee shop with some seating inside and more tables outside in the back; since the weather is beautiful now I like to sit outside and have my coffee. I'm not one who usually buys pastries or sweets at coffee shops, but I have had one of their cookies before and I really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Delicious coffee - not too strong. Flavoring is to die for - no slacking on high quality flavoring for that caramel macchiato nor iced mocha or vanilla coffees. Here at Lola's, they aim to please. Fresh muffins and pastries that are quite good that they handmade on site.  Staff is always friendly despite how busy they are. Atmosphere is great for hanging out, I only wish it were not so loud. Some seating out back rocks if you're lucky enough to score a spot. Parking is a pain in the ass. Still, I would recommend this place in a heartbeat and I continue to return again and again.  Don't pass this place up if you have a chance to try it out, folks!"}
{"text":"Lola embodies what supporting local companies is about! They've assembled a first rate company that consistently serves EXCELLENT java and offers a wonderful assortment of pastries. The setting is amazing with big windows facing the road that let in lots of sunshine. Wonderful melodies are constantly playing and I especially like the retro stereo. I pop in only before work so I 've yet to spend time and soak up the atmosphere, but this is a local company that Phoenix can take pride in."}
{"text":"My first visit to Lola, and I have to say I was quite impressed.  Above all the service and product were perfect. But it's also looks like it would be a great place to meet friends or sit and get some business accomplished. My wife is a barista.  Both of my daughters are baristas.  I have a bit of an idea how this works, and they do it well at Lola. One of my family's pet peeves is arriving at the counter at our local coffee shop to find our \"regular drink\" ready without even having to ask.  It bothers my wife and daughters that their coworkers will do this for regular customers. Heaven forbid they should choose to try something new one day.  I don't know the barista's name at Lola this morning, but I heard her ask several regular customers if they would be having their regular drink before she made it.  Icing on the cake for me.

As I sit writing this review, swilling my mocha and nibbling a scone I'm already planning when I can come back...."}
{"text":"I'd always seen this place when I drive by on my way to Bliss/reBar, and my coworker lives behind them and had nothing but good things to say about this place.

I must say, the coffee is delicious. I stopped by to have breakfast and caffeinate up before the Phoenix Comicon, and got the iced mocha. On a whim I decided to splurge on the whipped cream calories. 

O.M.G. That whipped cream had coffee in it. It was DELICIOUS. My boyfriend got his cafe caramel hot, and it came with latte art on it! (Silly, I know, but I've yet to experience latte art first hand). He loved the coffee. He described it as having notes of... peanut and chocolate? Or maybe it was another place's. Regardless, he's picky about his coffee and he loved it. 

We also got omelettes off the omelette bar. It's really quite simple, but they did it very well. I got mine with mushrooms and caramelized onions, and they went heavy on the fresh cracked pepper, which I love.

The decor in this place is pretty awesome. It's got raw exposed brick, concerete floors, an industrial vibe going on. I loved the reclaimed wood tables, and it's fun to see where they roast the beans, and to know that they roast their own. 

I don't live and work near this place, which I am somewhat grateful for. Otherwise, I'd be getting fat off of iced mochas with coffee whipped cream. That's not fun."}
{"text":"Great coffee! The staff isn't always the friendliest but the coffee is always good. Their chocolate croissants are the best!"}
{"text":"I've never been disappointed by this place! It's worth driving in PHX traffic for, seriously. I get the iced caramel Latte, so amazing! Their dessert choices always look so tempting & the whipped cream that they make is heavenly!!"}
{"text":"(The coffee = good Tea = good.  Not the best)  The location = great.  Perfect setting for a neighborhood coffee shop.  The inside = great.  Communal seatting, cozy, not to busy; very entreating.  Menu = so-so.  Not much going on in this department and what is darn expensive for cookies and cakes by any one's standards."}
{"text":"Wonderful coffee shop. It's hard to find coffee shops in downtown Phoenix where you won't feel judged by the slew of hipsters that populate it. I felt very comfortable here, and came on a rainy day so the shop was still pretty full but not too point where I couldn't navigate through the tables.

I ordered a cafe caramel and got the tortilla espanola which was NO JOKE by the way. It was so good. The cafe caramel had a hint of caramel and their roast (didn't ask what they use) was strong and beautiful and everything that is right with the world when you get that jolt of caffeine in the morning.

TIP- Park at the gold parking lot right behind the coffee shop!"}
{"text":"There was dirt in their ice.

I ordered a bottle of sparkiing water and an iced green tea.

Decent WIFI, but I won't go back, because there was dirt in their ice."}
{"text":"Lola is in a great location on Roosevelt near Central, next to Pita Jungle. It's spacious inside with high ceilings and full of couches, tables and bars. They have a kitchen too and a decent mix off snacks on the menu. The coffee is strong and flavorful and they have all the standard espresso drinks too."}
{"text":"This coffee shop is confortable, tastefully decorated and well located. Staff is friendly and the coffee is great. But the music is so loud, this place is noisier than some bars. The baristas have to yell their orders through the din. Do the owners really understand coffee culture? I now go to Songbrid instead. It is a pity, because some classic jazz in the background would make this an unbeatable place."}
{"text":"I would probably go here daily if I lived nearby. Lola is a great spot to relax and get some work done. I stopped by this morning while waiting for my dry cleaning next door and was impressed by the prompt service, even on a busy morning. I hate to admit it, but the Starbucks drive-thru is usually my go to morning coffee stop, but this morning's trip to Lola proved to me that it's worth taking a little more time for a better product. My caramel latte, blueberry scone, and bell pepper quiche were all magnificent, and the kicker was it took far less time than the \"convenient\" Starbucks drive-thru! 

I'd also recommend stopping by when you have no time constraints. Lola's cappuccinos are quite lovely."}
{"text":"I refer to Lola's and the \"Hipster\" coffee shop and more. Why? Because everyone dresses hip and they all seems so laid back and chill in this little gem. The customer service is second to none, the place is very clean and the coffee is superb. 

They make in addition to great coffee, bomb omelettes, quiches, and other bakery goods."}
{"text":"Coffee is strong but good. Not a lot of food options, but the pastries looked amazing."}
{"text":"Best coffee I've had in a long time.  The Caramel Latte is to die for.  The owner is super nice and wrote me immediately after I had inquired about what type of Caramel they used.  A+++"}
{"text":"The food here comes much faster than most coffee shops. Customizable breakfast sandwiches are fantastic and very well sized for the price."}
{"text":"Coffee was average.  Friendly people and nice outdoor seating.  No water misters outside so it's warm."}
{"text":"Updated review 3-2-2018

I live steps away from Lola and usually like coming here. I come here often to get a coffee with neighbors/friends or simply to read a book. I agree with reviewers that sometimes the service can be lackluster but usually the baristas are great. However today I was extremely disappointed by Eric's service, the guy was manning the cash counter. He simply did not understand my order, I must have repeated it like 5 times. Initially I thought he was being goofy, and by the fifth time (no effort made to clarify my request),he was sort of mocking me. No other way to interpret it. The guy was unapologetic and made no effort to get my business when I walked off. Pathetic customer service. Lola owners: please get your act together, train employees like Eric to be courteous and sincere, and have them represent you well. I will gladly take my $$ to other cafes that are popping up all over Roosevelt and downtown if incidents like these reoccur."}
{"text":"My home away from home. 

I write some keyword blogs for a living so I need someplace to work. I go here and try to look like I am working on a script instead because the hipster girls like that.

The baristas are all lovely ladies (Except Joreal [sp?] but he is cool as shit so I let it slide).

The coffee is divine. The place is hip and you will run in to myself and/or Wayne almost daily and that's cool right?"}
{"text":"I ordered the italian flat bread. It was super moist. (when it comes to flat bread, \"moist\" is an automatic fail of course).

I also had a latte with almond syrope. Before this I don't remember the last time I had to throw a coffee away. Yes, it was that bad."}
{"text":"I can't get enough of their chocolate croissants!! Super delicious and recommend that you get it warmed up so that the chocolate is soft and gooey. I usually get the lattes with whip cream and the baristas never disappoint!  The feel of the coffee shop is great with super cute decor and plenty of space to sit. They have a small patio in the back, so I'll bring my pup and just relax with my latte. Customer service is always great too! Definitely recommend this cute coffee shop!"}
{"text":"I can walk there!!!

 Not, like, a real city person walk. I mean a \"Phoenix, Arizona, this is totally walking distance from my office\" kind of situation. So, I am in heaven. 

That being said, I'm not sure I can see myself hanging out at Lola. It was sort of chilly inside (both temperature wise and general tone). But, I have been enjoying the coffee. 

The first time I went to Lola, I got their version of a white mocha - very very good.

Today I picked their drip coffee and asked for hazelnut flavoring to be added. I was pleasantly surprised that I was not charged extra for the hazelnut, that I ALMOST tipped the girl ... if only she would have smiled ... or made me feel remotely welcome. 

So, Lola could use some customer service spiffying up (based on other reviews I read as well), but it's not going to stop me from going there. 

Did I mention I can walk there? 

Oh, and the coffee today was really quite good."}
{"text":"4 Stars but this little spot has great potential to be a regular stop for me and will likely rate a 5th. Rode my motorcycle downtown to try Lola Coffee and I was not disappointed. The Cafe Mocha with some whipped cream was just perfect. I also tried the quiche, warmed up, which was also tasty. I sat outside in the little patio area. A little warm this time of year, even this early in the summer but it IS shaded and really pretty relaxing. It's just off the street (Roosevelt) but you still get the feeling of separation and intimacy in the spot. I can see this being perfect during cooler weather. I'll be going back to try their other offerings, but first impression: I would highly recommend Lola Coffee."}
{"text":"Second visit to Lola and it didn't disappoint. It was very crowded on this particular day so seating was limited. It was almost impossible to walk through with a small stroller. So if you bring your kids in one, be careful not to hit the other patrons while moving through the shop. Altogether a very cool, hip spot with good drinks."}
{"text":"I got their caramel latte with their house whipped cream as  recommended. The caramel latte was good but the star was definitely the whipped cream. It was so good!! You have to get it on any drink if you come here!"}
{"text":"My latte was great.  The blackberry turnover was so good I had to fight with myself to not go back and buy another.  But the frittata was really terrible.  It was about 4 inches tall and a weird pale grey/brown color with an spongy texture.  That is not what a frittata is supposed to look like or taste like.  I ate 2-3 bites and then had to toss it.  Don't waste you money on it.  Buy 2 pastries instead."}
{"text":"Good food,happy people...It's a nice little place to enjoy the beautiful mornings in Arizona!"}
{"text":"I give this place a five star for a few reasons...

1- I really dig the Roosevelt area. Wasn't crowded at all on a Sunday afternoon and the surrounding buildings and palm trees make for a great leisurely walk with your coffee.
2- The service was great. The barista working was enjoying  a slower moment out on a bench with friends in front of the shop and as we arrived she got up immediately, greeted us kindly and told us she was going to go wash her hands before helping us and making our drinks. Having worked at a coffee joint myself once, I understand the slow times and the perks of helping a shift go by much easier when friends stop by and I'm glad she gets to hang out while understanding the importance of customer service. Go you barista lady!
3- The drinks were great! What more can you really ask for when you are purchasing a coffee. I got a large iced mocha with two shots instead of four (four would kill me) and my boyfriend got a medium iced latte. We are kind of coffee snobs and the drinks were wonderful. I normally order an iced toddy or an iced americano but was feeling rather indulgent that day.
4- The atmosphere was my style. Big open room, great tunes!, lots of places to sit to use your laptop, seating outside in front of the shop as well as great seating outdoors behind the shop and here's the kicker.. the bathrooms were clean and I didn't cringe or hold my breath while using it.
5- They are local and they hang local art. Anything local in my book, is a win.

This place is great. On my days off it will be a great place to sit and escape with my laptop or my current read."}
{"text":"I have passed this place so many times and I always say I am going to stop and try it!  I finally did and I am so glad I did.  I love chai lattes so of course I had to try theirs.  It was awesome!  It was the perfect amount of sweetness and spice.  The atmosphere is open and it looks like a great place to come with some friends or to just come by yourself with your laptop and do what you need to do.  The girl was by herself behind the counter so she was a little overwhelmed but its ok because my drink was great!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"The coffee is good here. What I'm really giving 5 stars for, however, is the ambiance and vibe. If only I lived closer, I'd hang out here more often, though perhaps living further away makes it a more special trip when I do get to come here. Big windows allowing lots of natural light, open floor plan, a mix of people both in age and demographic, and again, just a very pleasant atmosphere to catch up with a friend or read a book solo."}
{"text":"Too pricy on the food i ordered a breakfast burrito with a small iced coffee and paid $19 and it was not good!"}
{"text":"I love Lola... the matador is simply craveable!"}
{"text":"I love this coffee shop..the area is perfect
And the inside is spacious enough. 

They also offer breakfast pastries and now burritos. I have yet to try the burritos but the pastries are on point. 

I usually get an iced chai latte and it's made perfectly. I usually add extra cinnamon which is on the side bar. They have a lot of extras you can add too!"}
{"text":"Cool scene - indoors and outdoors - with the hipsters and gays of Phoenix. Great coffee and pastries.

Air conditioning could have been stronger and acoustics made conversation challenging."}
{"text":"Something I enjoy about Lola's (as opposed to some of my other CenPho coffee favorites) is that it is CONSISTENT!  I do not have to worry about which barista is working or what drink I order - it is always good. 

-The staff is always friendly and takes time to get to know their regulars.
-They always have great music playing.  
-Aside from their pastry case, they usually have some hot food you can order. 
-They have the best whip cream around - seriously.  I never order whip cream at any other coffee shop, but I really don't mind those extra calories here.  

My least favorite things about this place: their seating.  Yes, those old metal school chairs look fabulous - but they are cold and uncomfortable!  If I'm going to hang out there for a few hours, I don't want my butt to go numb from uncomfortable seating."}
{"text":"Coffee is delicious, such flavor and depth. Food is savory, sweet and creative. Lovely hangout spot, as well."}
{"text":"I have become a regular here when I decided to switch my business to local AZ, and have never looked back. Lola's on Roosevelt is by far my favorite cup of coffee in town. I am still exploring local coffee spots but Lola's is the best, always a quality drink and pastry! The coffee is strong and the flavor full. All of the baristas are great and just spending time in the atmosphere is great with something to work on, or a friend."}
{"text":"My husband and I buy their beans every two weeks and brew at home! We love the quality and the price that Lola sells! They did recently go up $3 of their beans but for us it's still worth it still beats lux and other coffee shops price per oz!"}
{"text":"Great food but the process is a little broken to get your food.  You build your meal to order instead of a menu which can be nice but also very time consuming.  You have to wait for your order in a crowded area since it won't be delivered.  The food was very good but outside the flies were horrible to the point we didn't want to stay long."}
{"text":"One of my new favorite coffee shops.  Really, really good espresso and friendly staff.  The atmosphere is very relaxed and inviting.  Recommend to anyone who loves good coffee and espresso."}
{"text":"Oh Lola, you are soo freaken adorable!!! :)
I am in L-O-V-E with this coffee shop, so laid back and hip!! I love its comfy feeling and sudden relaxing effect it has over you as soon as you step in, it's clean, modern and beautifully decorated all over!!!  
Oh and yeah my Chai was oh so yummy along with a cherry scone! 
The girl that helped us was super nice and knowledgeable of the drinks and baked goodies this coffee shop offers. I would gladly want to own a coffee shop similar to this one someday!!! :)"}
{"text":"Quaint atmosphere; the tortilla Enspanola and the veggie quiche was great. Variety of seating spaces; good for an early morning breakfast or a good read. Fresh OJ was delicious; the pulp and seeds were at the bottom of the cup."}
{"text":"So I went to Lola a few days ago thinking the local coffee shop would be great considering all the people in there. BOOOOY was I wrong. All those \"people\" in the shop were just pretentious little hipster kids and the staff (one confused looking girl) didn't know ANYTHING about coffee. She was stuck up, non interested and just plain rude. I ordered a large vanilla late and received a medium regular late, no vanilla. It wasn't a friendly place, I felt unwelcome there and I'll NEVER go back or recommend that place. If your looking for a good coffee shop downtown hit up JOBOT, the people are friendly and the drinks are a million times better."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. My friend loved the coffee he ordered. I'm always disappointed, though, when I go to a cool local coffee shop, order a chai latte, and see them grab a box of Tazo mix. I wish they would show as much care in the choice of chai as they do in coffee. That's not enough of an annoyance to stop my coming back, though."}
{"text":"Mmmm surprised I haven't reviewed this yet but they've got pretty amazing pastries. It must have been over a year ago when I came in with my friend Roxy and enjoyed a strawberry crumble. 

Just last Friday I returned to meet my friend Cole and his mom. They were sharing a mocha, espresso, and almond milk so I followed their lead and couldn't have been happier. This was real strong and I'm definitely happy I got a small especially since it costs almost five dollars!!! 

They've got a back door area as well and good ambiance too but as per the usual downtown, parking is quite the hassle."}
{"text":"Fantastic coffee & espresso: I'm not on the apparently growing super-high-acidity bandwagon, so I enjoy what I'd describe as the strong, but balanced roast Lola produces -- perhaps more importantly, the staff is incredibly friendly and skilled in their craft. I go here several times a week and have never had an unpleasant interaction or a poorly made drink, from when I started coming almost a year ago till now. Prices are very reasonable and, key for me, pre-include tax & are all round to the quarter, so paying with cash is a breeze. 

The interior aesthetic has a rustic-urban feel which for a Nor-easterner like me feels like a very comforting blend of \"old\" and true-to-the-region. Fresh flowers and other greenery are always kept on the tables, which really warms the place up, and work from local artists rotates regularly, so there's always something new and interesting to look at on the walls. 

There are lots of options when it comes to how quiet, lively, or distraction-free you're looking for: between outdoor seating both street-side and in a quiet, shady courtyard out back, tables in the lively main room and some in the more secluded back hallway. (& bike racks both in front and in back!) Most of the chairs are vintage(esque) ergonomic, backed metal. I've read some other reviews on here that really knock the chairs, but I've got a bad lower back, and I have to say, the short-list of chairs I can sit in for more than a couple hours without the onset of pain includes Herman Miller Aerons and these chairs at Lola (there are a few wooden-backed, velvet upholstered ones which aren't nearly as comfortable, as well as some old draft-table and short metal stools which are no problem comfort-wise). 

All in all great place. My favorite of all the coffee joints in Phoenix, I'd say."}
{"text":"Great coffee and friendly people! They do a darker roast than what I consider my personal, perfect espresso.... but for a darker roast, it's perfect! Very minimal bitters, and clove influenced cocoa is what comes to mind while enjoying my morning shots :)"}
{"text":"Great place. Super tasty stuff. However, don't let \"The Predator\" make your order. You'll know her when you see her. Big, mean dreaded lady. She's the least consistent out of all the employees and she's mean!!! Other than that, this place is pretty great."}
{"text":"Lola is a great coffee shop in downtown Phoenix. Whether you are from the area or looking for a new spot, it's a great place.  For starters they have a great Blanco and Mocha coffee, with the best whip cream I've had (they flavor it with espresso). The vibe is hip and they feature rotating local art. 

The drawbacks for Lola are poorly designed seating and their breakfast menu. The room fills up artificially quick because most of the seating is occupied by one person while being designed for 2 or 4 people. Coming to Lola with another person or *gasp* more can be a problem if you want to sit together! Also, they have one of the worst omelets ever. Seriously. Denny's is better. They are not a restaurant, they are a coffee shop trying to expand their offerings- sadly it was done poorly. If you want a bite here, get a baked good- they won't blow you away but they won't remind you of the LOST finale (that's the omelet!). 

On a side note, the last time I went to Lola (about 2 months ago) I had the worst customer service experience of my life. It's not worth going into, and it certainly does not represent the otherwise great people, but without that trip I would have been hard pressed to give Lola at least 4 stars."}
{"text":"Stopped in after having lunch at Pita Jungle next door. First time here and seemed like a typical coffee shop but that is what it is. The first thing I noticed was the smell, it smelled great! Fresh roasted coffee hit my nose as soon as I walked in, I knew it was going to be good. 
I ordered a mocha and when she told me the price it was the price on the menu. Tax must be built in but I think that is the way it SHOULD be. My coffee had a little leaf design and tasted and smelled as good as it looked. 

Definitely will stop by again when in the area.  Plenty of seating, good atmosphere and a lot of open laptops. A nice place to hang out and smell the coffee!"}
{"text":"Ordered my go to iced coffee with almond milk. Came to $3.25 which in my opinion, is quite reasonable. The barista even put in a shot of espresso on the house. I try to visit a new coffee spot every Saturday morning, this has been my favorite so far. Definitely tripped on the way in the door."}
{"text":"Super cute coffee shop! Park in the \" gold\" parking structure located directly behind the building-it's free and easier then searching for street spots! I ordered the skinny iced vanilla latte-$4.50 for a large! Drink was tasty and a  perfect blend to me of the sweetness not overly sweet but not a strong coffee taste.  The inside is on the smaller size and did fill quick but they do have seating outside as well! Lots of pastries to choose from even at 1130am! Studied inside and didn't find the noise to loud."}
{"text":"I've only ever had a latte and a slice of the tortilla espanola. Both were pretty good. I'd give this place another chance. The service was okay. Not too friendly or vocal (we didn't know our order was ready because no one at the counter said a word beyond the first coffee prepared. They let us stand there while our food got cold until we figured the to go order was  ours). I'm hoping this was a one time issue."}
{"text":"I'm biased as I live across the street, but...  It remains my go-to place for cafe.  And, if I'm not careful, Lola will be the reason why I blow up to 300 lbs.  (The baked goods are awesome.)"}
{"text":"I just moved in across the street. So I have been walking here and grabbing a pastry and or a mocha. 

This place has two entrances, one in the rear, or the main door located right off of roosevelt. 

The staff are very very friendly, even the people whom frequent this spot are very pleasant, I struck up a conversation with a man while I was waiting for my mocha just the other day. 

I stopped at the fair trade cafe just up the street and that place is rated very highly but I had a horrible experience there so I recommend this place much more over the latter."}
{"text":"Excellent coffee, cozy space, and well-shaded patio. Better for socializing than working on your laptop. Outlets are limited. Also, because the space is tight (which I do like in a coffee shop), people can see everything on your computer, everything you're working on etc. I don't do anything that would raise eyebrows, of course, but I just feel a bit too exposed when I work here. That being said, Lola is a fabulous coffee shop for hanging out with 2 or 3 friends or just stopping by for a joe fix."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times!! 1 time on the weekend for morning coffee, 1 time in the morning before work and once during lunch hours. Everytime it has been a pleasant experience.
Quick service, strong coffee, relaxed setting & inside/outside seating. Def. recommend!! Too bad we didn't have more shop's like this on the west side."}
{"text":"One of the best chai hot teas I have had as well as there NY style cheescake. All there baked goods are made daily from scratch"}
{"text":"I can't give a thorough review of this place, since I only got myself an iced mocha, and it's damn hard to make a bad iced mocha. But! I liked the interior and the pastries looked incredible. On the downside, as another reviewer mentioned, it is LOUD inside. Loud and busy."}
{"text":"What's most important about this second outpost of Lola Coffee is that it doesn't stray from its original formula and doesn't neglect the history of the Gold Spot building. High ceilings, lots of natural light, old-time fixtures and concrete floors -- I imagine this is what the old grocery looked like some 80 years ago in this very spot. Nicely done!

What really makes this spot better than the original location is the full roastery room and kitchen. So, while you're enjoying your cup of coffee, you can smell the sweet, smokey goodness of Lola Espresso Roast wafting up the rafters, as well as the heavenly perfection of Sweet Pea baked goods. You can't beat that."}
{"text":"This was one of the real highlights of my trip into Phoenix/Tempe.  I was dead set on having a chocolate croissant and iced mocha for breakfast.  I searched through yelp result after yelp result and always the reviews were the same, well rated by most, but those who didn't rate places well said the service stank or the places too closely followed Starbucks and way over-roasted their coffee.  Lola's was the one that stood out as having no real negatives.  I can see why.

My chocolate croissant was excellent.  Flaky, buttery, and not shy with the chocolate. It was a bit weird to get it with a knife and fork.

My iced mocha was excellent, chocolaty, but not so much so or so sugary that I couldn't taste the coffee.  Admittedly it was a touch more bitter than I generally prefer but not so much that it detracted from my enjoyment of the drink.

The staff, although a bit rushed the whole time, was friendly and helpful.  The vibe was industrial hipster, but for all that I blatantly stood out there (in Umbrella Co tac gear) I didn't really feel out of place or too bombarded by the trendy vibe (which sadly has done a lot to ruin what was my favourite coffee place in Vegas).  There was plenty of seating, and the chair I claimed was very comfortable. There is plenty of parking, which surprised me, and their outdoor patio was very nice.

I will miss Lola's."}
{"text":"Lola coffee is a great coffee shop. Many people tend to rave about it and I know quite a few people who say it is delicious. I can attest to them having a great mocha and dirty chia. It can get quite cramped inside when busy, but there's always outside to chill when it's not too hot."}
{"text":"I LOVE this spot!!

As others have mentioned, when I made my first trip to Lola, I didn't know if it was a hipster reunion or a coffee shop. The staff were in a conversation and took a while to acknowledge me. 

I gave it another chance and am so glad that I did. I have come to love the place. The coffee is SO tasty, I no longer need ten pumps of flavored sugar to drink it. 

The staff are super friendly and warm to the point that you might think they are religious missionaries. I think it is sad and unfortunate that some reviewers are judging the staff based on body art or clothing. Really? It's 2010, chances are good your accountant AND physician have tatts or piercings. 

Tonight I took my sister to Lola for dessert and we had a great time. The staff are friendly and warm, and made great suggestions. The barrista even gave us a hot tip on a local concert. 

I live in the area and there is no finer spot for coffee. Fair Trade is musty and s-l-o-w. Check out Lola, it's a winner. 

Oh yah, they also have great music- it's nice to sit with a great drink and relax."}
{"text":"Lola Coffee catered coffee for our wedding in downtown Phoenix. They were really nice to work with, went above and beyond our expectations, and everyone loved the coffee (parents and grandparents actually commented on how good it was)."}
{"text":"I love the original location and I have given it much praise since I do love their coffee, especially the Matador. I was so excited to come here ever since I heard that they opened a location downtown but WHAT A disappointment it has been. I honestly just dont feel welcome like I do at the other location and just like PREVIOUS reviews have stated, the staff is rude, especially the guy that makes the coffee makes me feel like I am unwanted as a customer there and same goes for the cashier. The owner Daniel? is really cool and always greets people nicely but the staff at this location is just too good for the public or something, plus some of those chairs are extremely uncomfortable, so for now I will have to skip this location and go to the one that's farthest from me to get my delicious Matador."}
{"text":"The staff is always friendly and super quick. I know a lot of times people complain that non starbucks type places take too long but it certainly isn't the case here. The iced caramel is my go to and the matador is delicious but super rich and sweet."}
{"text":"They always pull the perfect shot of their full bodied Lola's espresso blend. Lola's is located in the historic Gold Spot Market, has a wonderful outdoor patio and the perfect vibe for grabbing your morning constitutional, hanging with friends or being productive."}
{"text":"Great place for a Chai and a relaxing clear your head moment. Love the ambiance and the music was top notch!"}
{"text":"I had the Matador which was mocha with cinnamon. It was very good, the coffee here is better than Starbucks but not nearly as good as the coffee home roasted at Village Coffee Roastery in Scottsdale (get the dirty chai or cappuccino there, both are to die for) or Cabin Coffee Cafe in Glendale (the honey bear is incredible). Although this place was somewhat busy it was very quiet and the atmosphere was very relaxed. There is seating inside as well as outside. The style of this coffee house is very airy and open, I remember there was a lot of natural lighting coming in so it wasn't dark or relied on artificial lighting as much as other coffee houses. It almost felt as though I was in someone's kitchen, not a business, which may seem strange but it was actually comfortable. I hope to come back and try more caffeinated concoctions here."}
{"text":"Delicious! Delicious pastries & delicious coffee. Everyone is super sweet and gets my order right all the time. I definitely recommend this spot to others."}
{"text":"Nice location. The indoor seating is social.. It is a friendly community establishment. The staff is friendly and the service is good. You can sit outside if you wish, and the food is very good. I would recommend Lola Cafe!"}
{"text":"I recommend Lola over any other coffee in Downtown Phoenix. 

They consistently do everything better, faster, and cheaper than the competition. The coffee is strong, reasonably priced, and there's a decent menu variety. I live nearby and have had to limit myself to 2 visits per week or my budget app starts chastising me with notifications reminding me how weak I am for a good latte and scone.

Treat yourself: Try the whipped cream at least once. It's incredible."}
{"text":"This small downtown cafe had delicious coffee, reasonable prices, and irresistible, homemade parfaits. I just wish their shop was a little bit bigger to cater for the amount of traffic they receive, so that they could put more seating in for customers. Great morning spot with a fun vibe though!"}
{"text":"Our iced vanilla americano was good and not too sweet.  I was more impressed with the omelette!  It was moist (nothing worse than a dry omelette!!) and well seasoned, and the havarti was a nice addition.  I think 1$ per additional veggie is a bit of a rip off, but otherwise well priced.  The only strange thing is that the salsa comes with the food at the window, but the garlic aioli needs to come from the girls at the front?? Strange.  But still yummy.

Cute indoor and outdoor seating and we had no problem finding a parking spot within a block during the week around 9am."}
{"text":"My favorite cafe downtown, I've never ordered anything but the Americano because it's just right every time. I love it.  I did order a pecan pumpkin pie slice today which was very good, I liked how light the filing is.  It wasn't heavy or overbearing.  The pecan nuts were a great compliment to the south pumpkin filing and the crust was perfect, still in top of my list of favorite places to decompress and grab a snack. Kudos Lola"}
{"text":"I frequent Lola Coffee on Central and Lux Coffee as well but I was very disappointed in this one. The location is quaint and the building eclectic; I do like the high ceilings but as far as comfort the coffee shops furniture are old school chairs, tables and vintage artist drafting chairs are beyond uncomfortable. Maybe they don't want people staying long but I wouldn't recommend this shop. The coffee is okay and the staff are wonderful unlike the staff at the Central location who barely say a word but I would have to say on a honest opinion, no thank you. I think there is always room for approval but they would need to makes some changes. They also close at 7pm which seems a little early for the city."}
{"text":"Nice coffee shop. Cool hipster spot with better than average coffee and espresso drinks. I had the Matador, which is what everyone recommends, it was alright but a little to nutmagy for me. My wife got a dirty Chai tea latte, which she said was pretty good. Plenty of seating, but a little noisy to try and work. They also have a variety of bakery products."}
{"text":"Cute place - great vibe, but the coffee and espresso lack flavor and depth. My daughter thoroughly enjoyed her dessert in a cup (iced vanilla mocha), but my Americano and my husband's coffee lacked flavor. Granted, were connoisseurs, so our expectation is greater than the average consumer, but it was disappointing nonetheless."}
{"text":"This is our favorite coffee shop in town. We bring visitors here specifically for the Matador if they are coffee drinkers. The omelets are worth it too. Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Great place to chill and just enjoy the atmosphere, great coffee and blueberry muffins that can't be beat. Recommended."}
{"text":"The coffee here was substandard. The blueberry muffin tasted packaged. (We hear their other baked goods were better.) The vibe is stuck somewhere between a college coffee shop and a strip mall."}
{"text":"I'm usually not this far out west in The Valley, but I happened to be in the area and was looking for a cafe to rest in for a while. 
The coffee has a very unique flavor, not necessarily my favorite but still great. It's my first time having coffee with such depth to its taste.  Usually I need sugar in my latte, but this was fine without it.
The ambience was nice, not too noisy or too hushed. The guys working there were all great. 
The best part of all- they do latte art. This is the first cafe in the valley where I've gotten it! I was so happy! 

It's a close walk to the Japanese Friendship Garden, so it could be a nice place to rest afterwards!"}
{"text":"I wish the coffee wasn't so good because the service is absolutely wretched. You'll be ignored for several minutes then treated with surly indifference. But oh, the lattes..."}
{"text":"Loved the colors in this place and the patio is sprawling. Lots of dogs outside and it seems like a great community hub where everyone knows each other. 

Coffee was a little watered down, but it did the job and the pastries were delicious. It can feel a little dark and crowded on the inside so not too great for working. Limited outlets too. Overall, an okay place, but not worth regular visits in my opinion"}
{"text":"Lola's is top notch in the coffee! The coffee & chocolate chip cookies keep me coming back. Thanks for making a good cup of joe, Lola's!"}
{"text":"I came here for a coffee meeting and was SO impressed with the tranquil atmosphere, quality of the coffee, and quaint historic downtown location. I ordered a non-fat vanilla latte and it was the perfect afternoon pick-me-up! If you're in the Downtown Phoenix area and looking to park somewhere and work for a few hours, I highly recommend Lola! It is pretty small inside and they do have outdoor seating so if you're here in the hot summer months, it may not be the best place to choose if the inside seating is taken! I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"The barista was super friendly here! A nice welcome after a long flight. I'm glad I passed up the lengthy Starbucks line to try this place. Iced coffee's not too bad either!"}
{"text":"A fun coffee shop within walking distance of my house works great for me. Definitely not the best in the neighborhood but it has a very unique and fun style and I've never had to wait in line."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place! The food was great, staff was friendly, and the food came out fairly quickly. I got a breakfast sandwich on a crescent with a side of seasoned breakfast potatoes and a iced chai. The prices are very reasonable and the quality of the food was great. The only downside is that it gets pretty crowded and you might have to compete for seating since you have a lot of people lounging on their computer for a long period of time making it difficult to find an open seat to enjoy your meal."}
{"text":"I make a point of coming here when I'm downtown.  Great place to hang out and get some work done.  I don't drink coffee but great teas and I like their muffins as much as I did the Lola on Camelback.  Not a ton of outdoor seating but I'm usually working inside so not a huge issue for me.  All the girls who work here are great too, very friendly and helpful.  Very cool music too..it's toughto beat this combination of good atmosphere, good staff, good food and good music in a cool, urban, transitioning neighborhood.  Wish I lived closer."}
{"text":"Latte was really good.  Mini pineapple upside down cake was great.  Patio was very cool also."}
{"text":"Better , I think the smiles are cracking through a bit. Keep trying people, a smile helps a great deal. 
Quality food & coffee"}
{"text":"Delicious coffee and food, great service and very relaxing ambience. We sat outside on the patio and people had their dogs with them. Really nice."}
{"text":"I have been patronizing Lola's since they were on Central, the first time (then Lux, now pane Bianca). Oh, I have waxed (poetic?) frequently, on how much I bemoan the loss of Lola's Tapas...  

So Lola's closed Tapas and reopened as a coffee shop, and it was good. Then they closed that location (now known as 'The Wrap?') and moved back to Central in the small shopping center housing Twirl and Hulu's (into the location where Tessa's Teas? or a combination antique shop and tea house previously resided for many years). And, it was good. Until, they left. (Two other incarnation coffee shops followed in Lola's wake but it now sits unoccupied.)

This current Lola's location is in a sweet spot next to Pita Jungle and nestled snug in the bustling art district, supported by hipsters and professionals serving the state's capitol (minutes away) and just north of the downtown business district, also adjacent to one of Phoenix's Points of Pride Japanese Gardens and just a nudge farther north, Encanto Park. I do, btw, very much miss the earlier occupant, an Italian deli with a genuine and warm owner. Their wares were SO delectable, especially the rice balls (cant think of what they were called).

Okay, so, this coffee shop sits on Roosevelt and has a large window front facing the very busy street. There is a table with room for five where one can watch the world walk by. The ambiance is rustic and cozy (like Tapas was, oh I so miss it). There is outdoor seating both on the sidewalk next to the street and in back on the patio--dog friendly(!!!). Lots of seating indoors.

They have a skilled baker/cook (quiches, frittatas, tortilla espanolas, etc.). They used to have a STANDARD Rosemary shortbread, yum. I don't visit often anymore but the last many times I've been, the shortbread was not present, sigh.

Patrons include students studying, professionals working, parent(s) with child/ren in tow, or...the likes of me, hanging out.

Back to the location. Lola's shares Roosevelt with Red Hut Coffee (their iced coffee IS good), Tammie Coe's Bakery (excellent baked goods, acceptable coffee), Songbird Coffee (has a similar 'feel' with it's own street side window/seating, great coffee, cool shared space, select baked goods, fun weekend waffles), very nearby is the acclaimed Jobot--respected by peer coffee shop owners along with Cartel, and Fair Trade.

Lola's Coffee bar, on Roosevelt--and, it is good (grin)."}
{"text":"Outside C Gates - outside security 

It's pretty good- if your addicted to Starbucks then you won't like it... but it has a nice flavor (nonfat vanilla latte w almond milk) 

Some food choices - a few sandwiches and danishes.

Not busy at all"}
{"text":"Fun factoid for the Yelp world.  Lola Coffee occupies a space that was once owned by my great grandfather.  Originally constructed in 1925, The Gold Spot Marketing Center historical building once housed a business owned by my great grandfather called O.T.'s Liquor Store.  He opened it shortly after prohibition was repealed, looking to cash in on a reborn industry.  Downtown was a much different place back then and his business went through good times and bad.  Today there's no sign of the old liquor store, but the bones of The Gold Spot building remain in tact.  And with Downtown back in full swing, the old building houses not only Lola Coffee, but also Pita Jungle, Salon RO5, and The Painters Lounge among other tenants.  

As others have accurately pointed out, this historic space is gorgeous.  Quintessentially Roosevelt Row, molding the bones of an old building with art on the walls, casual furniture, and a modern coffeehouse atmosphere.   Lola can seat around 30 people inside and another 20 or so in the shaded patio out back so there's plenty of room even on busy mornings like this one.  I've been to Lola a few times in the past, but I'm not a coffee drinker and their food offerings had always been limited to whatever baked goods were in the case.  Or so I thought.  I saw they had updated their website recently with an option to make your own custom sandwiches or burritos.  WHAAAAAT?!?!?!  Come Saturday morning, I was here at the opening bell.

My last trip to Lola had been almost two years ago so admittedly I've been out of the loop on a few things.  Like how CRAZY busy this place gets in the morning.  Arriving at 7am, there was already a line of over a dozen folks in front of me, most waiting to get their morning cup o'Joe.  Understandably, the action behind the counter is a beehive of activity as the baristas work double time to keep the line moving (which they do a good job of).  It stayed busy for the first full hour they were open as the line never got shorter than 10 people.  The bakery case was full just as I remembered, but behind the register now hangs a food menu that I hadn't remembered seeing in years past.  That's what I came here to discover.

Along with ordering a small orange juice, I asked to order a breakfast sandwich.  Immediately, the gal at the register handed me a list to fill out so as to customize my meal.  My decisions were as follows:  Sandwich, regular eggs (instead of egg whites) with a medium scramble, ciabatta bread, cheddar and mozzarella cheeses, sausage and bacon meats, tomato and spinach veggies.  Total cost for the small OJ, sandwich, and tax came to $12.  The sandwich took almost 10 minutes so it was a bit of a wait.  But once the kitchen called my name to pickup, I raced over.  What a payoff.  All the ingredients were perfectly cooked and piled high.  They didn't skimp on the meats or the cheeses on this by any measure.  The ciabatta was perfectly toasted and the veggies were melded beautifully into the egg.  Great portion, fantastic flavors, delicious breakfast to start off my Saturday.  

As with any coffeehouse review I can't speak to the coffee as it appears I'm one of the last 30 somethings on Earth that doesn't drink coffee.  That said, the coffee menu here is along the lines of what you'll find at most coffee houses (espressos, cappuccinos, iced coffee, teas, etc).  But the customizable sandwich and burrito menu is truly a treat here.  Lots of ways to make yourself the perfect breakfast or brunch meal, and of course those tasty house-made baked goods in the bakery case up front.  Now that I know Lola offers a full assortment of delicious breakfast items to go with everything else that makes this spot so popular, save me some space on their bandwagon.  My great grandfather would be quite pleased to see his old store reborn into the success story Lola has become."}
{"text":"Living in the area, this is the place to get coffee.  Some of the staff used to be very rude, but upon meeting suzy, a very friendly barista, this place has become our normal coffee spot.  Nice decor, good music, and very good coffee!"}
{"text":"Good tasting coffee. I'm impressed because they helped recommend what type of coffee to have, as I'm not a huge coffee enthusiest. 
 Make sure to stop in if only for their German chocolate cake!!"}
{"text":"Lola is one of those solid coffee shops that is a destination from just about anywhere in the valley. They're a nice destination for anyone within a few mile radius; walk, run or ride, they keep a bike rack out front.

Pop over whenever you're in the downtown area for better than the average breakfast, quick coffee or tea break, or evening chill session over the weekends. I enjoyed a solid slice of quiche last weekend; although it would have been out of the park with some spinach or veggie added to the recipe. They've also got a selection of pastries to grab, or omlets to order. The wife ordered an eggwhite omlet that was surprisingly yummy!

Heed this suggestion; skip IHOP, Denny's and Coco's and aim for Lola's at breakfast instead.You'll be glad you did.

Happy Dining!"}
{"text":"Presenting exquisite pastries and an exceptional cup of the black liquid, you can expect a delicious cup every time. I would live in Portland Park just so I can walk to this place every morning. 

My only issue is of course with how busy this place gets, but who cares, coffee's good, so stand and sip it is."}
{"text":"I've seen Lola Coffee appear recently on one of my favorite blocks in downtown Phoenix. The day I finally set foot in there I was pleasantly surprised and am happy to say Lola Coffee was beyond what I expected, and I was expecting it to be fabulous ;) 

The parking is easy to get in and out of, plus plus! There are two entry ways, one in the front and one in the back. The decor/ambiance of the coffee shop is awesomeness. It is a cluster of rustic, vintage and post modern. The people inside seemed like nice/interesting people reading their morning paper rituals over coffee. The shop is very clean, organized and \"pretty\". 

The barista and cashier were both very friendly and welcoming. Oh how I love when people making coffee have some extra enthusiasm that rubs off on me and sparks up a positive day for me :) 

The coffee was FRESH. The power of fresh coffee is beyond words :) They have all the essentials to making your own coffee to your preferences. They also have some not-so-ordinary pastries on display that look delicious. 

Overall, I am giving Lola Coffee five stars. I loved the location, the inner setting and the people that work there. Great service and a great commodity! 

Five stars for this Cenpho coffee house :)"}
{"text":"I guess I could have gotten an Americano, or maybe now that I am super coffee snobbery, I am always looking for places that do pour overs. However, I ended up getting a medium soy latte here ... and it was ok.

I think Lola is a cute spot, but the parking situation can be a little harrowing because there isn't much of it, and a lot of it is along one way streets so if there aren't any parking spots you end up having to do huge block turns just to get back to where you were before.

There's cute indoor seating where you can definitely work, and I am sure they have wifi of some sort ... but overall I wasn't a huge fan of the lattes because they don't use a dark enough roast with lattes to really bring out the flavor of the coffee. I may come back, but with so many great coffee spots in Phoenix ... I'd skip if this was on your list."}
{"text":"Lola Coffee conveniently located in Downtown Phoenix. This is probably one of my favorite coffee spots! I love the cozy feeling and the location. Every month they change their wall art. I love seeing the different themes every time I come. Also in the front glass wall they have different flowers that are switched up. I love that! It just adds a unique ambiance. 
The coffee is great as well. I usually switch with the cafe blanco, a delicious creamy latte with vanilla in a big mug topped with some beautiful latte art. I also love the matador coffee. I like the sweet combination of chocolate with the espresso. Sometimes I'll get a pastry and the German chocolate cake was moist and very delicious. I always get great customer service when I arrive. The baristas are helpful when you are stuck on what you want to order. I never have a problem with that. The only con to this place is that the seating is limited. I wish Lola was just a tad bit bigger. I love coming here to study especially because it's near ASU downtown campus. I will keep coming here!"}
{"text":"How could I forgot exactly how much I love Lola Coffee. I remember this coffee house to meet a friend that lived in the area not long after it opened. So yesterday's visit after work was a joy. I enjoyed a nice cup of coffee in a mug and loved every drop. This was the perfect place to unwind after work rather than the usual Starbucks -- so happy I decided to mix things up and try somethin' different. I'll have to make it a point to try breakfast here. Cheers***"}
{"text":"I was traveling in a far away land where a decent cup of coffee was unavailable, I've been to Lola's before and although I failed to provide a review, I knew that they could provide a suitable espresso beverage. I let the man behind the counter know my plight and he suggested El Matador.  I'm sold.  They really provided a stellar cup when I really needed it.  Robust flavor, they listened to my 'not too sweet' request and got it right."}
{"text":"Very cool place in a great corner of downtown Phoenix.  I'm not a caffeine drinker, but their tea was great...love the vibe inside."}
{"text":"Being that this is one of my go to, favorite coffee shops I feel bad that I have not taken the time to give it a review...

-The coffee & espresso are always on point. Best tasting in town in my opinion. Never bitter, consistently just right. 
-The pastries and food and great, made with high quality ingredients. Be mindful though, that their delicious breakfast burritos are only served until 11am, learned that the hard way one day ;)
-The baristas in general are a bit slow to warm, but once you start frequenting, they recognize you & make you feel glad to be a repeat customer. 
-The owner sometimes works as barista and when he does he always does it with a warm smile. 
-The space is historically hip. I'm a fan of original brick, and I love the local artist's displays. My favorite area to sit is in front of the window facing Roosevelt St. The patio seating in the back is great especially in Phoenix Fall/Winter/Spring :)
-Neighbors Pita Jungle, another excellent choice when you're in the mood for a meal. 

All around, love Lola."}
{"text":"The location of this little hot spot is in perhaps the hippest, most beautiful section of downtown Phoenix. Almost a European feel for the sectioned town and courtyard it is in - right next to Pita Jungle.   Love everything about this place except for one thing... If you plan on staying, it is perhaps the noisiest coffee spot on planet earth.  Still, that said, you need to go... Great coffee and wonderful homemade food."}
{"text":"If you're going to be choosing between Starbucks or here on the concourse outside of security I would say the drinks here are awesome.  And maybe I should push this higher, but the service after the coffee was made was really rough. 

Let's get to the borgia...it was an Orange and Chocolate mocha...so yes that means double chocolate and the orange hit the spot right where it needed to as I was waiting for my girlfriend to pick me up."}
{"text":"Great coffee and great prices. A spacious inside and tables out back are just the beginning. This coffee house is the place to chill on a nice afternoon. The staff seems genuinely happy and pleased to explain their different options. Service is quick, too.

The coffee itself is rich and flavorful. It is fresh tasting, and they offer all variety of swetening options, including raw sugar. The portions are reasonable, and drinks not just loaded with milk and syrup.

If you are looking for a place to relax and catch up on your emails without feeling alone or rushed, this is it. Warning: you might become a regular!"}
{"text":"Love love love. The atmosphere is great, the coffee is phenom. Will be coming back very soon.
The patio is to die for."}
{"text":"Great coffee and great selection of greets. Their Chai Tea Latte was SOOOOO GOOD. Coffee Latte was also delicious. They have a cute outside area to chill and have your coffee. From the back area use door with the 6 on it. Clearly all the drinks were delicious finished everything!!"}
{"text":"I love Lola's coffee!  The space is amazing and the people there are very friendly.  Their pastries are good as well!  I love my coffee and the thing I hate the most is when you go to a coffee shop and each time you have a different experience... each time I have been to Lola's it has always been the same, great!!!"}
{"text":"I posted a review of Lola after my first visit and was asked to take it down because some people thought it was too harsh.

I've given it four chances now.

And I have to say, I am disappointed with Lola. I have been on the hunt for a chill coffeehouse in my neighborhood, where you can work and sip coffee, and occasionally chat with your neighbors. I live in right on Roosevelt Street and was hoping Lola would be that ... but it really lacks the ambiance I am looking for. The coffee was alright. The espresso shots tasted like they were burnt. The croissant I had was dried out. 

But the vibe is what was really lacking for me. I left after 45 minutes. I would rather be in my own house ... in my own space. I think the owner was in when I came in once and he didn't even make eye contact or greet customers ... nothing. I think that's why Lola is lacking an authentic vibe.

It is an intimate space, and the decor is nice, but being in there puts me in a bad mood. Too many wannabe hipsters and pretenders - and that includes the inappropriately dressed and overly tattooed baristas behind the counter. OK, you've got fake boobs, we see them already. I don't need to see them so intimately. You may also want to get a pair of jeans that fit so I don't have to see five inches of butt crack while you're getting my coffee. And dudes, having ink doesn't make you hip. Being able to be engaging and interesting makes you hip. And the sour looks don't help.

I REALLY want to like Lola, but every experience I've had at Lola has been full of the attitude that I hope to avoid in an independent coffee shop. 

Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Lola's \"Blanco\" is seriously the best white mocha I've ever had. They've got chill service, great coffee, and keep the place nice and clean. It's a good spot to meet friends or whatever..."}
{"text":"I love Lola. Great tasting coffee and pastries. Really low-key atmosphere with a low-key, yet pleasant, staff. It's a bit small, but in a hardly-noticeable sort of way. The furniture positioning and mellow vibe keep even a small crowd cool and copacetic. I look forward to returning."}
{"text":"Live near by, but have never stopped in.  Glad I did today. The iced coffee was refreshing, along with a sweet peanut butter cookie that was both moist and flavorful.  Really like the ambiance with the big front window seating that is shaded enough to work on my laptop by the window.  Great mix of seating options for working, meeting, or chatting with a friend.  Good stop for any reason.  Only thing that took me a minute to figure out was where to park.  A little more directional signage would help."}
{"text":"I like this place for all of its outside real estate, I don't like the cups they put your cappacino in."}
{"text":"Went for our first visit while in town staying at the found:re

Great coffee, great food, friendly quick service. They have a cute back patio we sat on while enjoying the beautiful morning. 

Thanks, well be back"}
{"text":"Some times the little things make the biggest differences. In this case it was the Agave nectar.

I am not a huge coffee person due to my aversion to caffeine but I was thirsty and was just next door for lunch. I was happy to hear they can decaf just about any drink.

I went with a basic iced decaf american 16 oz for $2.50 seemed like a decent deal. 

With the agave nectar and creamer at the dressings station it was quite good.

The place has a real down town hipster feel with a retro sound system and tables that match the macs that people are using."}
{"text":"Tasty caramel almond milk latte. I really like that they put 2 shots in a small, nice and strong."}
{"text":"Very fun and open atmosphere with awesome baristas!

The three of us were just walking around the area when we spotted this place.  My little cutie pie had the strawberry Italian soda with cream and whipped topping he really liked.  The barista gave him a complimentary cookie, so sweet.  We also had to have some chocolate cupcakes!   I had the chai latte.  I wish I had gotten a coffee drink instead with all the good reviews about it.  There's always a next time.  Hubby clearly enjoyed his latte.  It was a beautiful day, so we got our drinks to go.  We'll have to bring our group and plant our butts  to enjoy the place next time.  I noticed some pastries and other hot food items that looked wicked good too."}
{"text":"Great location, cool place, nice courtyard. Not to mention coffee :) and pastries."}
{"text":"Loooooove Lola's. I repeat I love Lola's. The tiny coffee shop located in the historic area of downtown Phoenix has the best coffee in the valley. I'm hooked on the chocolate coffee. My afternoon treat that keeps me going. Nice tiny shop to meet a friend or chill alone. Dining inside and outside while you munch on their fresh baked goods.

I highly recommend this tasty coffee shop if you need to meet someone downtown. This is definitely the go-to spot. Support this local business you will not regret it."}
{"text":"I'm pretty critical of coffee shops and this one was contemporary, crowded, and not at all exciting. It's in a nice, manufactured part of town so I was surprised this was on the list of suggestions from my hip Airbnb hosts. The coffee was standard. The crowd was mostly businesspeople. It's not a place I would come to again."}
{"text":"The baristas here make magic happen! Wonderful drinks with very little wait, even with a line."}
{"text":"After traveling to Europe nothing has come close, until now! the coffe  truly has the essence of rich and delicious flavourful coffee only found abroad."}
{"text":"Ok. This is my local Lola. 

My only real complaint is that the staff is pretty rude (unlike my experience at Uptown), unfriendly and make me feel pretty unwelcome. I'm a regular so that's pretty dissapointing. The staff is constantly talking amoungst themselves.

Because of this, I felt displaced. But I settled in at the main table and tried to study. I ordered a cupcake and LOVED IT. And the orange juice is AMAZING.

Minus:
- Rude staff
- Uncomfy chairs
- Lackluster hours
- No punch card/discounts offered

Plus:
- Quality
- Wi-Fi
- Atmosphere
- Location

While I want a balance of friendliness and personal space, I also want someone to crack a smile so atleast I feel appreciated for patronizing their business."}
{"text":"Lola Coffee has awesome baked goods.

I love myself some coffee and espresso but rarely do I really try a place's bakery simply because I don't think its going to be worth it. Don't make that mistake here cause we bought a slice of Zucchini Walnut Bread (or something, I'll admit I forget exactly) and we loved it. It kinda tasted like Life cereal which was crazy but went well with my Matador Latte. My girlfriend ordered a Green Tea lemonade by request and that was crazy good too. 

On a previous visit I had tried a Matador Espresso. Essentially a flavored shot of espresso I was really pleased. I make this mistake a lot where I get \"ordering anxiety\" so I order an espresso usually leaving me wishing I had gotten something else but the Matador Espresso is really good and although I was still thirsty I didn't feel like I let myself down with this choice.

Their beans are pretty good too, good choice if you need some but there are other places in the area to get beans that I would prefer.

It appears as well that they have fresh fruit available too which often is missing from most coffee shops I've visited in the Valley. 

Go to Lola!"}
{"text":"I stop here everyday, when I can. The \"Matador\" is the best coffee drink on the planet, it makes my coworker go in to this berzerker frenzy. Like a Mexican Cornholio. The chocolate croissant is the best thing I have ever put in my mouth. There was one left the other day, and I almost slapped the shit out of this old lady for taking it before me."}
{"text":"I live a mere three blocks from this wonderful place, yet I've only been twice.  Don't ask me why, though, because I don't have a good answer.  Both visits were very nice.  More than nice, actually.  On each occasion, I was met by different baristas.  Both were super-friendly and chatted with me while they prepared my order.  It's a very refreshing change of pace when you meet a stranger who seems genuinely nice and makes you feel like they actually like you.  Lola's employees make me feel this way.

I'm the sort of person who will frequent a business with great customer service even if the goods they offer aren't the best.  At Lola, I get both!  On my first visit, I ordered a Cafe Au Lait and some sort of decadent cupcake.  Both were extremely tasty.  Today's coffee was a latte, I believe, with caramel and white chocolate.  So, so good.  Mind you, I know nothing about coffee except that I generally hate Starbucks and prefer my coffee light and sweet.  And bonus? A raspberry bar on the house.  It was one of the best raspberry bars I've ever had.

The other night, I took a friend to another local favorite coffee house.  I'm looking forward to taking him to Lola next time we hang out.  And I'll definitely be stopping by Lola more frequently on my own!"}
{"text":"Best vanilla latte I have had thus far and I have tried many of the Valley's hottest coffee joints. Lola's vanilla latte was perfectly balanced between the sweet of the vanilla, creaminess of the milk, and bitterness of the coffee. I was in heaven! The only downside to Lola's for me was the lack of pastries. It's kind of disappointing when such a great coffee place doesn't have much of a food scene to accompany it. However, if you're just looking for a great cup of coffee with no snack- this place is so killer!"}
{"text":"It's the perfect location to wait for the international flight arrivals. The ambiance is nice, though the music is too loud. My iced tea is good enough. The service is their big downfall. I waited 15 minutes (I got sidetracked people watching) for my drink which is unacceptable."}
{"text":"Hands down best coffee in town. Yep there, I said it. Heck lets say it again - the BEST coffee in town I l mean come on, whats to say, I clearly love everything about this place. Its is basically everything you want in a coffee shop, locally owned, knowledgeable staff,  excellent wifi (cuz lets be honest, how else is work getting done) comfortable seating, excellent location (even if parking can be a minor nuisance) and coffee that is just phenomenal. Hang on, coffee that is phenomenal consistently ! They roast their own coffee onsite and so you know what you are getting is quiet honestly as fresh as it gets. 

Heres 2 parting pro tips : 

Get the largest size possible. Why ? Because every darn drink is so damn sinfully delicious why would you deprive yourself? Self denial is over rated when it comes to coffee. 

They are now open in terminal 4, so buy your beans from there and you dont have to deal with baggage issues, cuz you know you are buying more than just one, i mean you do have friends dont you ? Yep, you're welcome."}
{"text":"Not really my scene... Sitting really close to everyone on their laptops.. A little too reminiscent of lux. The coffee was fine, better than Starbucks it not as good as lux of fa me caffe. Parking really difficult. Not my favorite spot."}
{"text":"You have a fill out a request form when you order a breakfast sandwich...wait..did you just read that correctly...yes..you did...a form...with an official blue inked pen...while everyone else in the line behind you watches....

the coffee was great though.."}
{"text":"Coffee and service are superb ! 

The pastry selection is small but delicious. The place is small but there is outside seating. I love the cozy feel of this place. The servers are friendly and make a great cup of joe."}
{"text":"Stopped by because I wanted good coffee and a killer vibe. Needless to say, Lola Coffee did not disappoint- really embodied the artsy hipster feel radiating from the Roosevelt area. I had the Matador (cold) and was actually very impressed with the mix of flavors- cinnamon, espresso, and hot chocolate. The whipped cream on top was delicious and actually had a taste of mocha. I also ordered the chocolate chip banana bread and was unfortunately not as impressed. It was a little dry/stale (by 10AM) and the chocolate sort of took away from the banana part of the bread. Next time I'll have to try the chocolate croissant, which is apparently amazing. On the last note, I thought the prices were extremely affordable: small cold matador, medium Americano, a decent sized choco banana bread for $11"}
{"text":"luuuuuuvvvvvv the coffee! and the prices are great even on the pasteries! I meet many clients there and quickly becoming their favorite spot as well!"}
{"text":"It's ok the coffee does not have bang if you say well you should try their flavor drinks well it takes away from the true coffee"}
{"text":"Relax and enjoy

Today, I stopped in at Lola Coffee to grab a latte and something sweet to eat. This was my first visit to Lola's Coffee  and I really enjoyed myself.  Lola has a nice coffee shop feel; with large tables, oversized stuffed couches, newspapers, and magazines. Hoaever, if you prefer to sit outside Lola's also offers a nice outdoor seating area.

I liked that Lola's was busy with people constantly coming and going and I really enjoyed my caramel latte and Pastry, which was fresh and delicious.

Friendly staff, great coffee, tasty pastries, and inviting atmosphere (a bit small but nonetheless great.) What more can you ask for. So if you're ever in the area, you should stop by you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"What a great find!  Very friendly staff and the decor inside and outside is on point.  Oh, and their coffee is amazing too! We did get a cinnamon mocha, a cafe au lait and some sparkling water to compliment our caffeinated beverages.  We definitely go back when we are in the area. And I believe there is another one in the Sky Harbor Airport."}
{"text":"Let me just say, my friends would tell you, I am a coffee snob. 
I used to go to LUX way before they stuffed it full of furniture and became way too popular. (Hello, this is phoenix, can you offer some shade?) BUT now there is Lola Coffee and I can't remember the last time I went to LUX.
The first time I went to this location I was instantly reminded of my favorite Portland coffee, stumptown. I love the fact that you can smell the coffee roasting as you get near. It just has a great vibe and has decorated in true minalmalist fashion (yes, lux, this is what it looks like) My favorite drink is the iced coffee, they put 2 shots of espresso in there, and I didn't even ask, Thank you! The pastries are always top notch as well. I am still in shock that someone said their coffee is no better than Starbucks. Have some respect, geesh!"}
{"text":"Pretty tasty cup of coffee and you can beat their delicious baked goodies!  I love the raspberry muffin, nice flavor and not overly sweet!"}
{"text":"I drive 35mikes one way just for their amazing house coffee. It's an espresso blend that will have your taste buds buzzing. It's a small local shop, so be prepared for a good size crowd and don't forget to try a chocolate croissant too."}
{"text":"Automatically downgraded by one star due to its early closing time of 7 pm on weeknights.

Very cool space, cool vibe, great location, good music. Loved everything about it but the knowledge that, as a downtowner who works ex-downtown, I'll never have the chance to come again when I'm not on vacation or unemployed."}
{"text":"Lola is my go-to for morning perks and for a place to do my weekend work. From the incredibly helpful staff who are as gracious as they come, to the eclectic music mix, the rotation of art on the walls, and the mixed clientele, Lola is the coffee space of my dreams. Even when traveling to cities such as San Francisco, Austin, And the best of the Midwest and East Coast, Lola sets the standard for me about everything a coffee shop should be. You can tell there is definite pride in ownership, and Daniel's impeccable taste is evident in every detail."}
{"text":"I love the vibe of this place. I've gotten work done here and have met friends to catch up. The baked goods are delicious and the coffee is some of the best I have ever tried. It's right by a historic neighborhood, so I love walking around the area."}
{"text":"Lola, I would like to know what on earth you put in your coffee! It resembles only one other coffee I've had and that was in Portland. Lola, you put something in your coffee that sends a spark of energy to my brain and makes me work like a madwomen for the rest of the day! 

I really like this location. It has a lot of character and reminds me of a coffee shop I'd find in Portland or SF. It's not huge inside, but everyone seems to coexist comfortably together and it's an easy spot to have a meeting or do some work. 

They put something delicious and addicting in their iced coffee. I ordered the non-fat iced vanilla latte and I was happy for the rest of the day. The coffee was creamy, not too strong and perfectly chilled. I could have had four more but that would have been bad news. 

I will dream about coffee beans until my next visit for that addicting iced latte."}
{"text":"I dont drink coffee. If i did i might choose a place with hipster art, a cute girl named Joanna at the register who knows everyones name, and a coffee roaster in the back that you can see.

This place is a little piece of Haight and ashbury in the middle of phoenix. Very cool music, cool atmosphere and the soy chai latte was excellent."}
{"text":"The environment is great on a Saturday morning, people were laid back eating breakfast, conversing, some were on there laptop doing some school work.  On top of that my coffee was delightful I ordered a iced cafe mocha with coconut milk and no whip! Sooooooooooo satisfied for a morning on my way to work. Great place, great environment, great coffee!!!"}
{"text":"There are four places I can trust to make great coffee in Phoenix. Lola's is one of them. Nuff Said."}
{"text":"I've loved Lola's since it was located on Central, just south of Camelback. The newer location (Roosevelt and 3rd) is a bit smaller, but the quality of the coffee and snacks is still always excellent. 

Their iced tea is excellent, but I'm always a sucker for their Matador - a mocha with cinnamon syrup that is out of this world good. They don't always ask you if you want whipped cream, but you're really missing out on something special if you don't get it! 

Parking can be a challenge, but if you drive a but north in the lot, you can park in the covered garage which is only for customers of the spots in the area."}
{"text":"Absolutely better. All of the staff are very friendly, highly professional and proud of their craft. Has a beautiful patio and an ideal atmosphere."}
{"text":"Lola is best known for their coffee.  Overall, I thought it was pretty good, but for all the rave my friends were telling me about; I thought it was okay at best.  

I think Lola's is a cool place to hangout and chill, but I didn't care too much about the food and overall pastries.   I ordered their breakfast sandwich which I included spinach, cheddar cheese, and bacon on a ciabatta bread.  I love ciabatta bread and everything else within my sandwich, but there was nothing really spectacular about it.  I had to dabble some hot sauce to add some moisture to it so that I may swallow it!  

Needless to say, I think Lola Coffee is still a very cool place to hangout for some coffee and free WiFi haha! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I ordered oatmeal and it came out so drowned in cream / milk that it was cold and soup like. When I returned it to the register girl and explained how bad it was she just blankly stared at it - absolutely clueless on how to handle a situation like this just I returned to my seat outside and within 2 min we had to leave because there was a terrible smoke fire that pummeled out from the kitchen onto the patio. Everyone pretty much evacuated. Oh and my coffee was burnt. Get it together guys."}
{"text":"Lola embodies what supporting local businesses is all about! They have put together a first rate business that consistently serves GREAT coffee and offers a fine selection of pastries.

The atmosphere is awesome with large windows facing the street that let in plenty of sunlight. Awesome tunes are always playing and I particularly dig the retro stereo. I always pop in just before work so I have yet to spend time and soak up the atmosphere, but this is a local business that Phoenix can be proud of."}
{"text":"me likes. the coffee is goooood. love the matador with that amazing cinnamon whipped cream.... do yourself a favor and get it in all it's full fat glory.

there is plenty of seating here, but not for parties larger than 5. it's actually quite hopping early in the morning which makes it difficult for conversations as it gets pretty loud (8:30-9:30am), but dies down a bit after that.

love the barista and the cashier (courtney) - so sweet!

the only drawbacks... the baked goods are kinda meh. i like the homemade thing goin' on, but... the scones are SO hard, and the quiche had a souffle-y texture that i didn't care for. 

summary: get. the. whipped. cream. and maybe a lil coffee to go with that."}
{"text":"Downtown Phoenix is always tricky when it comes to finding a good spot to plop down and do some work while enjoying a good cup of joe.  You won't be the only ones to do that at Lola's.  It's the perfect spot for it.

Why go there:  The wi-fi is as hot and ready as the coffee and most importantly, the pastries (because caffeinated beverage all need a sidekick).  For the most part the pastries look to be made in house.  That's aways a plus.  The atmosphere is good, even when busy it doesn't feel like you don't belong, sometimes local hangout spots can make you feel like that.  Friendly ladies behind the bar.

Don't miss: The croissants, or anything made with that very same dough... and the patio (on a beautiful cooler Phoenician day).

Overall: A good variety of coffee and pastries to go with your coffee, this place isn't overly hipster in other words, it's not pretentious, it's kept simple and real."}
{"text":"I now have this new habit of trying out at least one local coffee shop whenever I travel to a new city and Lola Coffee was one of the top Yelp search results near the downtown Phoenix area. Later I learned that there is actually another Lola Coffee located in Terminal 4 of the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport. Overall this is a small (enough to fit about 25+ customers inside the cafe) and cozy coffee shop with free WiFi and multiple wall outlets. It was a bit crowded when our group got during the weekend, but there were few tables still available.

A bag of coffee beans is $14 per lb and the drink menu also has other non-coffee drinks such as fresh OJ, lemonade, and hot chocolate.

***

Matador (cinnamon-spiced mocha - $4): It had an unique aftertaste with pretty smooth finish. The drink was slightly sweeter than I would prefer, but it was a pretty decent drink.

***

It is no Philz Coffee, but I was pretty happy with my drink and I am a fan of this coffee shop.

P.S. - Please watch the step at the front entrance."}
{"text":"Lola can do no wrong. Love the atmosphere, the brew, the food, and the location. It's funny to me that people always talk about Lux, which the owner of Lola created and sold, and which is now more pretense than substance, IMO.

Lola is friendly, cool, and awesome coffee. If you're craving something sweet, the Cafe Caramel with homemade whipped cream is unforgettable. Baked goods out of this world, made in house.

I wish it were slightly cheaper, so that I could go more and not feel guilty, but alas."}
{"text":"Lola Coffee is one of my favorite coffee shops in Phoenix! I thought they closed a while back and was so thrilled to learn that they opened again on 3rd Ave. I don't live nearby so it's a treat when I make my way down to their cute brick cafe. My favorite coffee at Lola is the matador - hot chocolate with cinnamon and espresso. I love to order it as a cappuccino with lots of foam. The quality of the coffee is so much better than the big box stores, and it's what makes the trip down here worth it. The staff is always so friendly and the patio is a comfortable and cozy place to enjoy a weekend morning, with a little succulent garden and tiny finches flitting about. Lola Coffee is just about the definition of weekend goals."}
{"text":"Out of all the local coffee shops, this is one of my favorite. First, and most importantly, the coffee is great! It has a nice rich flavor, but isn't bitter. If you are looking for something a little sweeter, I recommend the Matador (along w/ the 50 other people here have).

Secondly, there is some pretty delicious food. I really like the quiche the best.

Third, the staff is always nice.

Lastly, it's a cool environment. If you're looking for a cool place to hang out, this is a good spot."}
{"text":"Lola Coffee does it again!

Already open approximately three weeks... and I didn't even realize that Lola had gone into this location (previously Calabria I believe).  I guess that shows how much time I spend in Downtown Phoenix.  (Not enough!)  The Gold Spot building that houses this Lola location has a lot of character and I especially love that there is plenty of parking in the area.  I also like that there is both indoor and outdoor seating.  

And the reason that I'm giving this location four stars instead of just three? They have the best barista in town!  Jensy (formerly of Mama Java) is employed here.  While I had an iced tea today, I know first hand that Jensy makes damn good soy lattes!

Now, if I don't get stood up for a meeting during my next visit to this Lola location, my experience will be even better!"}
{"text":"A cute little quaint coffee house nestled in downtown Phoenix! Although small, the inside offers many comfortable seating options. I had a double espresso and the taste was awesome and bold, just like it should be. The staff is friendly and made me feel welcomed. :)"}
{"text":"This my favorite coffeehouse in Phoenix. It combines excellent coffee, coffee culture, a great space, and good service.

Daniel Wayne is no stranger to the coffee business. He has worked in Phoenix, studied in Italy, started a coffee business in Seattle and two in Phoenix. I really think he is has a superb palate, respect for tradition while not shunning the modern, and a great eye for style. He is also very humble and gracious. His roasting style shows evidence of having spent time in Italy: not afraid of caramelization and a clear focus on balance + complexity. Daniel is a fine barista and I always ask him to make my drink, if he is at the store.

Coffee culture is definitely apparent. From the espresso machine to the roaster seen clearly through a window in the seating area, it is a place serious about coffee without being overbearing.

The space is outstanding. First of all it is \"real place\". It was an old market, I think and has perfect light, due to its orientation, windows, and high ceiling. Daniel pulls together an eclectic assemblage of vintage chairs, drafting tables, a glass door for a menu, and an old school console stereo w giant dorm speakers. The elements work together to make a relaxing urban space. Daniel plays vinyl and we both are huge Cat Stevens fans. He played the \"Tea for the Tillerman\" album for me on my last visit, which made my day.

Not sure why they get slammed for service. I have always been treated well by all of the staff. They may not have the \"may I take your order, please\" smiley service attitude, but are respectful and kind. It is a great place to hang out for hours or just get well crafted espresso drink and a pastry."}
{"text":"Lola's is by far the best coffee shop in Phoenix. Their service, baked goods, breakfast and coffee are exceptional."}
{"text":"Word on the street was that Lola had what I wanted so I went to go if it was true.
Lola Coffee is a cute a little shop off 3rd Ave and Roosevelt, it has a hipster kind of vibe, but don't judge Lola by that.

When you walk in you see the menu on the board on the wall and you see beautifully displayed pastries and treats in front of you, and I even learned that these lovely looking sweets are all made in house, that's pretty neat!

After checking out the board I went for a large Caf√© Caramel with whipped cream on top. 1st off let me tell you, this is freshly made whipped cream, it was perfectly sweet and a perfect addition to my coffee. The coffee itself, well that was delish and just what my day needed. 

Glad to have stumbled upon Lola's Coffee and looking forward to trying some of the pastries soon too."}
{"text":"Lola's is far and away one of the top 3 coffee shops in Arizona let alone PHX. And when I say top 3 it's more like a 3 way tie for first. 

What makes them number one... The pastries, espresso Con Panna, and the staff!"}
{"text":"I was really really disappointed. The pre-made food was.over priced and simply horrible. My iced tea had something floating in it. When I told the clerk, she seemed.oblivious about it. Ugh, stay away!"}
{"text":"There are very few places I can wander into and meet people I know well, each from a different personal life zone of mine.  Lola on Roosevelt is one of them.  A true \"3rd place\" I suppose - especially since I live over 6 miles away.

The coffee is chosen, roasted, ground and cooked with the obsessive passion that we've known and loved the past 10 years at all 4 \"3rd places\" - Lux, Lola Tapas, Lola on Central and now here.  The barristas are elegantly poised professionals who can handle crowd \"spikes\" calmly and rapidly - a very rare and precious talent [why is it done in these places so consistently?].  The confections have always been excellent - I wish the grains weren't so highly refined is my only quibble there.  

The old building is just perfect!  What they've done to it makes the space achingly exquisite.  And comfortable.  And comfortingly urbane.

I wish I lived next door."}
{"text":"Obs, a great location in the quaint Gold Spot next to the soon-to-be Pita Jungle. I really like what they did with the space. The vintage elementary school chairs bring me back to the days of learning cursive and pasting cotton balls on paper to create a snowman. Lots of natural light, too! The coffee is spot on, and they have pastries as well. -1 star for not having a punch card. They need to get on that!"}
{"text":"I actually have not ordered anything from here but I have to give it 5 stars for the sheer number of men that are there way early in the morning working on their laptops not dressed in shorts and t-shirts, slumming but actually hair combed and professionally dressed. 
Is this the new trend now?  To get office dressed to work remotely from a coffee shop. A single woman's dream spot to casually hang out to meet a guy!  Lol. I'm not kidding. 
If any of you single gals take my advice and start hanging out there (make sure you are also dapper and made up) after reading this review and snag a nice guy, well, I'm Chinese and love being a matchmaker so don't forget to send me a message with a little \"wink\" \"wink\". No need to share details. 
I'm sure the coffee is good here for that kind of intel, read the other reviews. 
Like I've already wrote, I didn't get any coffee or pastry there. And I'm sure the decor was nice but I didn't really notice. Nonetheless, thanks for the pick me up- the eye candy kind!!! XO"}
{"text":"Great food and service, love the location. 
This place is almost always busy, though sometimes I can get in there mid to late afternoon during a slow-down. 

I often get the iced tea and try a baked good.  The bakery items vary from day to day.  I've tried cornbread, cookies, and an apple tart - all very delicious.  

You can purchase coffee beans here too.   

There's free wifi, plenty of tables and rows of seats for us loners who like to just sit, sip, snack and work on the laptop."}
{"text":"The owner of this location is amazing and I can tell he cares deeply about his establishment.  This review is only based on the type of customer service I received through email and how quick he was to respond to my question regarding another location.  Given how prompt he was I could tell that coming into this restaurant the staff will have a great environment and no bad vibes at all the way a business should be.  I have yet to try out this location but I most definitely will have to go soon just to see for myself and update my review to add on to this."}
{"text":"The medium latte I ordered here is on my top ten list of the best I've ever had.  Most lattes are more milky than espresso flavored, but the latte at Lola was rich with espresso yet still creamy and milky.  There is an adorable little patio out back with plenty of shade where you can enjoy your coffee.  We ordered a chocolate chip cookie as well that was soft and full of chocolate.  I would be interested to try some more of their pastry items."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a specialty coffee shop, this is not the place to go. Denny's breakfast coffee quality. Cool shop though."}
{"text":"I'm giving it 3 stars almost solely on decor & atmosphere. 

After reading all of the rave reviews I really expected to be amazed, but sadly, that didn't happen. 

I did get a nonfat chai latte instead of coffee, so maybe that has something to do with it. It was kind of bland, nothing special :( 

But like I said, the company was good, the atmosphere nice & I love the look of the place :) 

If I try it again I'll try the coffee,,, I don't think I want to repeat my chai experience."}
{"text":"Matador is fabulous! I'm enjoying a cup of iced green tea at the moment and it's not too shabby."}
{"text":"The cappuccino I ordered was made with pure perfection by the multiple tasking, personable barista. The music was the perfect addition to the cozy eclectic vibe of this place. I will without a doubt be frequenting Lola's often!"}
{"text":"Lola, who can say something bad about it? But I won't give them five based on a detail: A female casher this morning. I'm a morning person, and I started the small talk, she seemed bothered by my comments, it was almost like she was being forced into politeness (if you're gonna fake it make sure it's credible). At the end I even complimented the barista's art work, but she (the same cashier) responded with a rather cold \"have nice day\" answer. I try not to take things personal, but improvement in that area is always a good thing. Having said that, I've always been treated very well by other baristas, and their coffee and pastries are very good...and that is why I can't give them less stars."}
{"text":"Great lattes!!! And great service. We visited around 12 coffee shops within 2-3 weeks of visiting Az. Lola is one that we will rate top notch. When you roast your own beans, makes a huge difference. It's like baking your Bread in house."}
{"text":"I think this place is too rich and delicious and expensive for people who have a relationship (like a wife and kids or whatever).  So I'm single."}
{"text":"Sweets are so delicious here! Seating was a bit uncomfortable and it can be crowded. Outside seating is quaint and kind of reminds me of European coffee shops that spill over into the streets. Didn't have good drink options for caffeine-free, but it is definitely worth a visit if you drink caf√©!"}
{"text":"Decent, not the best. I noticed after coming here twice that the espresso tastes a little burnt. Lattes are very sweet and when I asked for mine to be remade the baristas weren't the sweetest. The second drink tasted a lot better."}
{"text":"This is my favorite coffee shop in the downtown Phoenix area. The prices are moderately inexpensive and it feels like a little family when I go in. The drinks are delicious and the food is to die for!"}
{"text":"Great coffee and great breakfast food. The quiche was amazing. A great neighborhood spot, clearly popular with the locals."}
{"text":"I'm going on a coffee tour of Phoenix and the surrounding areas.  So far, I've been to 6 places and this has been my 2nd favorite in terms of the coffee taste (2nd to Lux).  My drink of choice is iced mocha and it was delicious.  It was hard to find parking, but the inside was much better than Lux for some reading.   The coffee was delish & service was friendly!"}
{"text":"Loved the cute and communal atmosphere, disappointed in the coffee. 

Arrived around 10 am on a Friday and the place was hopping. Every single seat was taken and it was raining outside, so the outdoor patio was a no-go. Like an idiot, I ordered my coffee to stay and then had to stand and drink it in the back of the shop.

The staff was aloof and cold and not exactly welcoming to an obvious out of towner. It's not the most friendly of places, but maybe they were just having an \"off\" day due to the yucky weather. 

There was a general sense of chaos and unpleasantness behind the counter. Since it was so crowded and the baristas were on the slower side, there was a huge bottleneck of customers just standing around near the front register that made it difficult to order and to move about. 

I ordered a cappuccino and it was just okay, with a slightly burned and over-roasted flavor to the beans. I had to add chocolate powder to top it off to try to mask the taste (The Horror! The Horror!)! Maybe Phoenix residents don't know what a good coffee is, but this wasn't it. 

I hate to rag on a local business, but I don't want any first wave / hipster coffee lovers to waste their time because you will be disappointed. I certainly was."}
{"text":"Awesome cappuccino, oh the the chocolate chip cookie w sea salt was the bomb!  The outside back patio is super cute!"}
{"text":"I stopped here before going through security at the airport. They do their iced coffee with a double shot of espresso and it was exactly the amount of caffeine I needed! The poppy seed muffin was also very good. The barista was friendly and attentive. Overall great experience and I will be checking out the location downtown."}
{"text":"This time I had their orange bread..... MMMMMMM like home made!! 

And again a latte! just like the way they know how to serve it!!"}
{"text":"I love it for the ambiance, big windows, tea (Numi organic) with free refills, giant cookies, quiche, couches and art books. A lovely space with a chill vibe perfect for studying or socializing. Just around the corner is the Japanese Friendship Garden, a beautiful place."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times, the last time was last Sunday 09/25/2016 and I like the location and the coffee. The first time (Early August)  was there their Credit Card Machine broke and the Girl was very apologetic. This time, the gentleman behind the counter was also nice and the barista working the espresso machine was quick to get my drink. The store is clean, WiFi is also available though I did not use it."}
{"text":"This place STINKS!! My hair, and clothes reek of BURNT coffee!!! The coffee made my friend gag, literally! There was smoke in the air inside and outside this place! I can still smell the bitterness and I'm now 20 miles away!!!"}
{"text":"For the same price I could go to starbucks. I didn't see the wow factor here. It's convenient for the people who live at Roosevelt square."}
{"text":"I found myself at Lola's Coffee because I was sluggish, and needing some coffee to fight off a food coma so that I could continue to enjoy my visit to Phoenix.  Google Maps done me right, all this time.

It's in a quaint location off of 3rd street, and I imagine if I lived remotely nearby, I could envision myself spending a lot of time lounging out at Lola's, because I ironically like a lot of the same aesthetics that hipsters do, despite being somewhat of a jock type.  But it's a clean and relaxing interior design with plenty of chairs, couches, and lots of reading materials while you partake in your coffee.

I'll be honest, the matador I had was pretty good, but in the end, still kind of forgettable.  Not quite the life-changing I must come back to PHX for this kind of cup of joe.  But still good.  The cookie I got was a little on the oily side, but still edible.

I give the place four stars, because I like the atmosphere, the two-toned girl who served me my coffee was a total fox, and the coffee was still good.  Phoenix as a whole is full of great eateries and coffee joints, and Lola's on 3rd easily fits in with the rest of them."}
{"text":"A rare, quiet spot near downtown with delicious coffee and friendly people. Always stop in here after Pita Jungle. Free parking in the garage next door!"}
{"text":"The best coffee shop around. Love the taste of their coffee exactly what I was looking for. Too bad it's too far away from me. I wish they would open more locations of north."}
{"text":"Great little coffee shop in downtown phoenix. Love the atmosphere and the people here. The coffee tastes great and it is much quieter and personal than lux coffee. I prefer this place a lot more. 
I love the decorations and the coffee is good on my tongue. ;)"}
{"text":"Went here yesterday and got a medium iced coffee. It tasted burnt and I couldn't even drink half of it. I was excited to try this place as I'm from out of town and saw the reviews, but this coffee was not good."}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago and had my best cup coffee here at Loa. I recommend the Matador, you should also check out the cool art on the walls while getting caffeine in your bloodstream!"}
{"text":"Lola is exactly what I look for in a coffee shop. Not too big, but plenty of seating, an abundance of Wifi, super cute decor, nice people, and of course the coffee is always good (my poison being the Cafe Blanco). It's a downtown Phoenix gem. I would recommend it to anyone and will keep coming back for more."}
{"text":"Hands down, this is my favorite coffee shop in all of Arizona. I crave it when I am away, even though I buy the espresso beans to make lattes at home. While having the beans at home is wonderful, it just isn't the same as having a barista at Lola's hand-craft my beverage. My favorite is a large iced vanilla latte because it isn't too sweet and the espresso is strong. Their pastries are amazing and ever changing. I've had a chocolate cupcake, a slice of German Chocolate Cake, and a gingerbread cookie. All of them delicious! Huge props to their baker.

The location is downtown, which can be a hassle to get to, but it's worth it. The inside is on the small and intimate side, which can both be a blessing and a curse. Thankfully, they have a nice patio outside, which is great when the weather permits.

Overall, I love Lola Coffee. If you love coffee, then you'll love it too. I cannot recommend it enough."}
{"text":"Was in town for the weekend and wanted to try a local coffee joint that was walking distance from our hotel. Lola did not disappoint! My iced latte was perfect and hit the spot! I also snagged a piece of their zucchini walnut bread because it looked so good....and it was amazing! The staff is friendly and overall has a good vibe."}
{"text":"Lola's Coffee is better than Fair Trade Coffee (4 blocks away). Other than that, it's just a coffee shop, nothing more, nothing less. 

One couch, two comfy chairs a table and the rest are rather ridged metal chairs. The high ceiling gives the place a airy if not vacant feel. 

They do have lots of space for laptops and lots of outlets to go with.

The coffee is ... well ... it's coffee. Nothing outstanding nothing horrible, but it doesn't come anywhere near the awesomeness of Lux or Conspire. 

The the biggest complaint I have is they only have ONE set of stereo speakers so the music comes from one area of the room and just bounces around the single room venue."}
{"text":"Standard coffee choices, but the hand writing on the menu is hard to read. The pastries that accompany the variety of coffee options are fresh baked. Seating is cramped. It feels more like a restaurant than a coffee shop."}
{"text":"Super packed inside and really tight with space.  The chairs and tables are super close to each other and no place to move where the sugar and water is at.  Tried the chocolate croissant and it wasn't buttery or flakey and we expected.  Also had the peanut butter cookie and it was too crunchy, I thought it would be at least a little soft inside, but no.  Kid had a chocolate milk and they obliged nicely when she asked for extra whip!  Sissy had a hot mint tea which are always over price, hot water and a tea bag?  I think these type of services should only be extra charged when they're the once actually brewing it, but whatever......I had the hot Mexican coffee and I guess I was expecting more Mexican chocolate flavor, or at least a stronger hint of cinnamon.  The sweets looked delicious, but because what we ordered was dull, I decided not to chance it further.  We parked right outside, but I can see how that could be a problem on a busy weekeday.  The outside is pretty cool, but definitely not an option in summer!"}
{"text":"Great coffee!  Love the patio and indoor seating. Great foam art, as well. Does it get any better than this?"}
{"text":"For an airport eatery, the price is not bad for their omelettes! I paid $8.50 and this omelette is humongous! Very happy customer!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my Sunday morning visit to Lola's. Felt a bit intimidated as I've been waiting to come here for such a long time, but just have never had the time to make the trip down from El Mirage. 

The coffee is fantastic, and the pastries are top notch. I liked the vibe / atmosphere - in terms of coffee shops, that's always part and parcel of the overall experience. It's got to be a place where you can spend stress free time without feeling rushed or pushed out the door, and I think Lola's manages that well.The downside is that for good coffee / food, you pay for experience more than your typical coffee house. That said, it was totally worth it in my opinion. Lola's reminds me of the Wild Iris in Prescott, which is a very, very good thing :)"}
{"text":"First off, the savory scones. The. Savory. Scones. They're what Red Lobster biscuits might be...maybe...if they were made with real ingredients and love. (My apologies to the baker for the RL biscuit comparison)

I come to Lola pretty often because I live in Willo. At first I came to Lola because the closest coffee spot, Roll Over Donuts, closed their Vernon & Central location. Now I come to Lola for the scones.

As soon as I spotted the savory scone with bacon and cheddar I had to try it. This is not your typical *cough...Starbu...ahem* scone. It is not a dense floury biscuit. 

The Lola scone is crispy on the outside and light, fluffy, and bursting with buttery flavor inside. I prefer their savory options, which change daily but often have yummy bits of cheddar throughout, because they taste like breakfast. Get it warmed up and enjoy it with a simple cup of coffee or am Americano. So damn good."}
{"text":"One of my favorite coffee shops.  Great neighborhood feel and superb coffee.  Small breakfast menu but tasty.  Wish their hours were more extended."}
{"text":"In comparison to Lux, I prefer Lola's much better! Lux is quite intimidating and confusing when you first walk and it's always full of \"cool kids\".  Not that I have a problem with them, but Lola Coffe Bar had people I could identify with--working adults like myself and I felt comfortable there. 
I had a cafe mocha with a chocolate croissant.  I went around 11am on a Tuesday, so it wasn't very busy. The baristas were nice and friendly,  and my order was ready in less than five minutes.  Overall, I had a great experience and will definitely come here often."}
{"text":"I love how adorable Lola is. It's the perfect hipster downtown Phoenix hang out spot. It's cute for a date, cute for office coffee runs, or cute for working out of the coffee shop! They have Wi-fi available and it can get pretty packed with worker bees throughout the day. Although the school desk furniture might not be super comfortable for a 5-hour work meeting marathon. Great coffee and LOTS of awesome (non-gluten-free, sigh) treats like cookies and brownies to satisfy your sugar cravings. The hot cocoa is to die for. The lattes are great, although their smalls are SO small! This is a great place, and a great parking garage to have in the middle of Phoenix."}
{"text":"Cute place great vibe. Coffee was okay. Great service. Love what they have going here and will be back for sure. I will just get something different than what I had the first time."}
{"text":"The best ever!  I will go out of my way to get coffee at Lola's.  The Cappuccino was perfect and my friends brewed coffee was very good.  We had cookies too; they were very tasty."}
{"text":"My friend and I were looking for a place where you could have good coffee and conversation.   We found Lola on yelp and decided to give it a try.  

We are so glad we Did!  We love the Cafe Mocha and Cafe Blanco!  Those 2 are the truth!"}
{"text":"Lola isn't the coffee shop I visit most often (mostly because they don't stay open late) but they do have my favorite drink, The Matador. Often imitated, but never as good, The Matador is truly delicious. I wish they stayed open later than 7...it's such a bummer they don't."}
{"text":"Had to drive to downtown Phoenix for a week for work and decided to stop in and get an americano. I parked in the back and thought I smelled something on fire. As I walked to the back door that was wide open I noticed that they were roasting coffee beans. I have been to places that roast their own beans but never seen them doing it, so it was really cool to me. The decor was very nice, it seemed that they spent a lot of time tying to reuse things and be eco friendly which I like. The menu was a glass door with a wood frame, bolted to the wall and hand written, I thought it was very well done, and I enjoyed my americano as well!"}
{"text":"We came across this place after walking from the Japanese Friendship Garden which is located down the street from this coffee shop. I really enjoyed my experience here due to the quality of the coffee that was being served and the friendliness of the staff. I always make it a habit to try community coffee shops when I travel vs. going to the generic place's like starbucks/coffee bean. The inside of the shop is a bit small with limited seating area but they offer a outdoor patio that is shared with other local business. Outside in the patio they have a water station with packets of sugar, straws, napkins, etc. Overall cute coffee shop with a great team."}
{"text":"This coffee is AMAZING and no I'm not exaggerating. 

Get the Matador coffee it is a creamy latte with different flavors. Free Wifi and the pastries are not delicious."}
{"text":"Lola's serves the best coffee in Phoenix. They roast their own beans and sell coffee beans as well as coffee drinks. The staff are friendly and efficient. The decor is cool and laid back. As an added bonus, I always run into friends at Lola's as its a popular meeting spot."}
{"text":"One of the best coffee shops downtown. Great atmosphere and wonderful staff. The brownies and banana bread are to die for as well as the caramel latte. Can't go wrong if you're looking to relax and enjoy your coffee. Great place for a quick date with friends. Wonderful patio in the back."}
{"text":"I drive far out of my way to come here.  Best coffee in Phoenix and BEST customer service. LOVE the ladies at Lola"}
{"text":"Being a native Seattleite it's hard to find a similar coffee shop setting in the SW desert.  I was pleasantly suprised with Lolas.  Their lattes are great and the atmosphere is very chill.  Love that I will be living so close and can walk or ride my bike here."}
{"text":"Great little spot. Salted chocolate chip cookie a touch too! Nice place to go sit with your laptop and work. Good intimate atmosphere."}
{"text":"The Roosevelt neighborhood has got it going on. For a moment I felt I was not in Phoenix when I was walking around. I stepped into Lola Coffee  which is in a beautiful historic building with high ceiling and lots of natural light. Hooray historic preservation! Lola Coffee roasts their own beans, but other than that it's just a coffee shop, but a damn good one. It was clean, they had a wide selection of pastries and goodies, the employees were nice to me. I am a strict espresso/black coffee drinker and it packed a punch. Well done, bean roaster guy or gal! 
I loved the back patio as well. I wish I lived in this neighborhood so I could go to Lola more often."}
{"text":"Lovely service. They ran out of Yerba mate and Moroccan mint tea, but the girl recommended the vanilla which was very good.  The airport unfortunately doesn't allow them to have a tip jar. It's a shame, cause they were really nice."}
{"text":"Centrally located. Parking could be better. Delicious chai. I am a sipper and my chai was still good later in the day with some extra ice. This place was pretty crowded but had a short wait and was delicious."}
{"text":"Eh. It was good.

I tried to be really indulgently scientific on this one, getting the same stand-by I typically get at Lux (Iced honey soy half-caf latte... man, I am totally the girl with multi-syllabic drink orders. Younger me hates older me.). And, well, it just wasn't as good. Could have been the honey or the beans or any combination thereof. Cheaper though! By a bit. 

Eh. I'll drop by when downtown for sure but it's no Lux."}
{"text":"My husband and I like to try coffee shops on Sunday's and today we picked Lola's.  I think we found our spot!  The food is amazing and they don't skimp on the portions.  I would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I was in the area and was in dire need of caffeine. Did a quick yelp search and found this coffee shop. It's a cute coffee shop. I loved the coffee and would have loved to try some of their pastries."}
{"text":"Well we've been coming here a while. We even moved into the apartment next door and thought this would be our regular place. 
Then this morning we decided to try breakfast there. Mistake. After ordering a breakfast sandwich to go we sat and waited while plate after plate passed the handoff plane. One to-go order came up but it clearly wasn't mine.
After 15 minutes I decided to ask what was going on. Politely since I know accidents happen. The girl behind the bar told me I need to wait 10 minutes and they'll call my name. End. 
Now I'm hungry and peeved. So we wait longer. Another 15 minutes go by and I ask a different girl if my order fell through the cracks. She actually goes to check with the cook who has no recollection of my order at all and says someone else probably took it. 
She offers a refund, I decline saying I don't mind waiting if they make it right. She says it'll be done in 5 minutes. 
Another 15 minutes go by, (45 since I ordered) and a to-go item pops up in the window. I immediately check it out and ask if it's my breakfast sandwich. The cook tells me she's not sure what it is even though SHE just put it there. She asks my name and checks the tickets then explains she turned my sandwich into an omelet instead. 
I take it and we leave. 
Looks like we'll be finding a different place for local breakfast. I understand accidents happen but lack of communication and organization when dealing with people's food is just irresponsible."}
{"text":"This is an awesome little coffee shop right in downtown Phoenix.  Good coffee, comfortable seating, good ambiance and music, service is fine.  All of the things that you look for in a good coffee shop.  I will definitely be back and next time I will be trying the baked goods that looked really good!"}
{"text":"Lola is good but very small inside and expensive. I enjoyed my coffee but I probably won't be back. Parking is also difficult and you either have to pay for parking at a meter or find a curb down the streets nearby."}
{"text":"I like Lola coffee a lot. They have been the most consistent with my drink order out of many coffee places. 

They have free parking and Ive almost always gotten a spot except once! 

They have great pastries and quiche to go with your coffee if it's either to go or if you are hanging out there are tables inside or outside. 

It's just a great place over all to sit, relax and enjoy downtown! (With the right cup of coffee)"}
{"text":"The best breakfast burritos in the valley! No seriously the best in Arizona!! The coffee is heaven as well! Cute, tiny, intimate place to have some yummy coffee. Their pastries look delish, but was too busy with my bacon, egg, potatoes, and cheese burrito."}
{"text":"Lola is the best coffee downtown. I've only had better in San Fran... There coffee is consistently better than Jobot. Only thing it's a bit hard to hang out here there are always a bunch of people here. The people that come to Lola are more up class and young than any other shop I been to it's great spot to meet people! They roast their own coffee an it has a very clean taste. It has ample parking in the parking garage free wifi ask for the password."}
{"text":"I ordered a drip coffee. The coffee beans tasted burnt and like Folgers. Additionally, the volume of the store was loud; however, the outdoor seating is convenient."}
{"text":"Not the best choice for a coffee.... my cappuccino doesn't taste right.. I think Barista didn't care about it and my milk is cold in my cappuccino :-( I'm not coming back here.... I'll better to go to Cartel there are coffee is always excellent!!!"}
{"text":"Typical rip off coffee place. My husband went to get my order and asked \"is this for lindsey\"? Short little blonde shrugged her shoulders and said I don't know, if that's what she ordered then take it.

Right... I absolutely LOVE bringing my husband to these artsy coffee places. He wears a backwards hat, has a huge beard, and wears regular clothes. Not the typical person to go to these places, leave a review, or even care. He has me write these things up and warn people of coffee shops that hire snobs. Had a sandwich. Half of the bread on the menu was a dollar up charge. They are make a killing off the local hundreds of college students in apartments around the area. They thrive off of location. They really don't care what us from Gilbert think. They will continue to make a killing unless you stop going."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was laid back inside and outside patio had lots of seating. I got the iced chai which was great and staff was friendly. I would go back here again."}
{"text":"This place was so nice! It's really charming and the drinks were delicious. The lattes were so creamy and smooth, I look forward to going back and trying more!"}
{"text":"I've been plenty a time.

Pastries = Smashing.

Mocha = Delish.

Matador = Cinnamon Heaven.

I've never been without being greeted by a welcoming smile and amicable disposition by the staff, especially miss Lisa."}
{"text":"Meh. If you're looking to experience FRIENDS without the cast and with \"mood lighting\" go here."}
{"text":"Best coffee place downtown Phoenix, coming from a Portland transplant. I struggled for the longest time to find a decent city coffee place with a good ambiance. This place makes everything right from their coffees, to their food & simplistic, unassuming, inviting layout. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Really good taste to their espresso, got a black americano and almost needed nothing to add to it. Pretty busy there in the morning but the baristas were quick and got everyone taken care of in no time. No complaints in regards to coffee and staff"}
{"text":"It's hard to find a good latte in Phoenix. So we were thrilled to find good reviews on Yelp and happened to be in the area. As others have posted, he roasts beans on site. The barista happily reported that she had run out of beans earlier in the morning so we were enjoying beans that had just been roasted about an hour earlier. The cookies were yummy too.

The guy who owns Lola apparently started in Seattle with a shop by the same name, then came to Phoenix to start Lux. He then left Lux to open Lola."}
{"text":"LOVE their coffee...one of the best around! It has a great flavor and aroma, and is very smooth. I buy their beans, which is pretty decently priced, for my own brewing at home as a treat :) Their staff is friendly and helpful, and the atmosphere is cool and relaxed. It depends on the day and time you are there, but the couple of times I've been there it's always been very quiet, which can be a bit awkward to hold a conversation, since all the tables are pretty close together, and the shop is just one open room, so pretty much everyone can hear you if nobody else is talking. Otherwise, I love this place, and they have great pastries too!"}
{"text":"I'm in love. Lola caf√© caramel love. The best coffee taste sensation is served up here with a smile. What is their secret to make this so smooth and creamy without any over-sugared taste, but with the caramel flavor hinting through perfectly? 

My breakfast also included the tortilla espanola, which was satisfyingly yummy with potatoes and eggs in the layers of goodness. It is offered warmed up or as is. I had it warmed.

Seriously cannot go wrong here! I will be back to experience their outdoor seating and more of their items."}
{"text":"Fortunately Lola is not convenient for my daily commute otherwise I would be here every morning and much poorer as a result. Best cappacino in town. I also like the small urban vibe. I wish Daniel would open another one uptown again. I miss the Central location, it was my Saturday morning habit for at least a year and the one that popped up at The Yard was awesome while I lasted."}
{"text":"I think I can die happy now. Literally the BEST vanilla soy latte I've had in a long time! I was really impressed with this latte lol. 

Decided to switch things up from my usual jobot latte and stopped by Lola and I am glad I did. Also ordered a breakfast burrito which was super delicious as well. this place does get pretty busy, but they are very fast. The staff is friendly, super fast, and helpful. Also they have a good sense of humor. 

So funny story my name is so complicated so when I order coffee or anything that requires my name I just say lani to simplify everything. And 90% of the time my name still gets butchered really bad. It has become a highlight on my daily snapchat story. The cashier that took my order wrote my name down \"Gilani\" she literally made my morning and my snapchat friends morning lol. That was probably the most glorious name butcher... 

Anyway a great place for some coffee for all my coffee addicts out there!!"}
{"text":"Their cheese danish rocked my face a couple hours ago. Additionally, it was really early when I went in and thus my ability to properly pronounce \"cafe au lait\" was truly sad. However, the barista didn't flinch, took a guess, confirmed it with me, smiled, and in one fell swoop we were on the same page. Didnt make me feel unworthy or out of place like coffee shops sometimes do for not being able to pronounce things. Cool! Tasted great too"}
{"text":"One of my favorite coffee shops downtown! Good location, cozy and cute environment both inside and outside. Staff is always very nice!"}
{"text":"The decor was awesome, very trendy. The  coffee was delicious. Only downside was it was a little warm and for it being summer time in Arizona they should've cranked the A/C a bit more."}
{"text":"This is the best coffee shop in all the land!!!! The baristas make this place fun, inviting and familiar!"}
{"text":"Really liked the environment, feels so cozy. The service is quick and friendly. The coffee is great! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great little authentic spot for a relaxing cup of coffee or a quick little bite to eat. I will definitely be back very soon."}
{"text":"Tried the coffee. It's soo delicious. Think it's one of my favorite coffee shops in Phoenix. They play the best songs and I could sit by the window for hours studying, people watching or even dog watching =]"}
{"text":"Try the Cafe Caramel and ask for their whip cream. Yum! Long-time favorite coffee spot for my sister and me."}
{"text":"Totally different vibe from Lux, which most in the valley know it's where all the cool kids are at. Sometimes, it's a bit too much for a Saturday where you just want to have a breather~

I came by for my daily dose of caffeination and a mini study sesh and loved how small and quiet Lola was! Simple menu, fresh made pastries, quick service and calm, quiet environment. Definitely no music blasting here, it's more of an acceptable background noise. Even the patrons were decently quiet and some stepped out to take their calls.

I just got a regular latte, no flavored syrup and no sugar for me. I wanted to taste their coffee and boy was it good! Not tangy or overly acidic and no burnt coffee beans, thank you! (I'm glaring at you Starbucks*) And boy, the caffeine kick in this small cup was awesome. I didn't grab a pastry, but saw the blueberry muffin/upside down cake sell out within the 1-2 hour stay of being there.

The staff is pretty quick and got to see regulars come in and conversate with the staff. Lola is pet friendly too! Tables along the wall, couch and chairs, as well as communal tables. Wish there were more outlets available, I saw only one during my visit underneath the large painting. If you're looking for a place not to be planted in front of your laptop, there's tables and seating out front and in the back- which is lovely if you're looking to bask in the sun and have a strong cup of coffee.

Definitely gonna come back to try their pastries and obviously more coffee!"}
{"text":"I have been on a quest of trying all of the different local coffee shops in the CenPho area, so naturally, I had to try Lola. Upon entering, I loved the high ceilings and the historic feel of the place. I tend to like my coffee tall, dark, and well roasted. No sugar or cream for me, and Lola certainly served up a good cup. I really liked the atmosphere and the friendly staff too. As for food, the pastries looked yummy and I would certainly consider trying one next time. I will definitely keep Lola on the list to revisit in the future."}
{"text":"Very cute coffee shop, great decor. The latte was average and the coffee art was a mess. Still tasted pretty decent though. The espresso isn't as flavourful as at Lux. I'd give them another shot next time I'm in Phoenix, maybe the barista was having an off-day or something."}
{"text":"I love Lola's downtown and drive boku miles to get coffee there. The airport is a joke. Arrived today at 4:50am, all other coffee shops open and they were trying to figure it out. Ordered coffee and an omelette at 5. Said 5 minutes for omelet- ok, 25 minutes later no omelet and they complained when I asked for refund. Almost missed boarding because of it - it's the airport. Coffee was weak - I had a quad shot and just not that great - their espresso shots were so long they were running over the side. Downtown on Roosevelt is amazing. This place is great to look at but lacking in quality and service."}
{"text":"Love Lola coffee. Place is great, staff is fantastic. Would give 5 stars if they opened at 6:30 instead of 7:00."}
{"text":"Such a convenient and cute little coffee shop. It's right down the street from my office so my coworkers and I love to go in and we know most of the employees. They're all usually very nice and the service is great and quick. Delicious tea and coffee too!"}
{"text":"It's clear that this place is a popular shop, it was crowded and a little loud when we visited this Friday morning. Seating is limited inside however we were able to find a spot outside, and thankfully they had umbrellas over them. They have a selection of baked goods (cookie & blueberry scone were very good) as well as sandwiches to order and of course, coffee. If I lived here it probably wouldn't be my personal favorite coffee shop but I can definitely see why many like it!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, very casually hip.  A front counter looking out the front window over Roosevelt provides good views and people watching.  One couch and two armchairs and a smattering of other tables completes this small coffee shop.  Good music and good coffee.  Not too loud and typically not too busy, although internet can be slow.  They also have pretty good pastries if you're looking to get a snack to go with your caffeinated beverage.  Calmer than Lux but more hip than Giant."}
{"text":"Amazing coffee, and the cookies and pastries are great.
This place is awesome, if you can find parking nearby of course. Try one of the side streets near the apartment buildings, there is usually parking around there.

But once you get over that whole mini crisis, come into lola's.. sit down and have an amazing cup of coffee. It was great to sit by the window and just chat. It is small and cozy and just what you need for a great chilling afternoon"}
{"text":"I had other reviews about this coffee shop, and a lady building suggested that we stop by to grab a cup of coffee.  
 

And you know I'm glad that we checked this place out. Yes, it is full of hipsters, but that's something that  can be overlooked.. Furthermore, make sure to check out their baked goods that are absolute heaven and are made in house. 

 
 

Lola my dear you are a breath of much-needed fresh air."}
{"text":"I've been a repeat customer off and on over the years.  The matador is my favorite, but I like the iced version better than the hot.  But the cafe blanco is soooo good hot!  

They are decently quick and friendly even when its busy.  Parking can be no fun at times, but on not busy times, there is a lot of parking avail in the garage!"}
{"text":"Good coffee, but TERRIBLE customer service!!!

The workers are slow and lazy and spend more time chatting with other employees rather than taking time for customers.

Where is the management???"}
{"text":"Great coffee, setting and food! Lots of indoor and out back seating. I got a sandwich and boyfriend got a burrito. Both were good! Sandwich was too big for me to finish (not a bad thing). Also the blueberry muffin was so good. We definitely will be back! I wish there were more tables out front. And also if there was a table with the breakfast order forms were I think it would keep things rolling. This was our first time ordering breakfast so we didn't realize we had to fill it out at the counter, which took time deciding what we wanted and then we had to get back in line again."}
{"text":"I just moved back down to Phoenix from Seattle. This place is pretty good!!! I got a large Carmel Latte. It was very smooth and brought me right back to sitting on pioneer square in downtown Seattle. The employees were very friendly here as well."}
{"text":"Love this place, I ordered Matador coffee here and just wanted to chill with my husband for a while. Nice place, only one think I wish they have more outlets."}
{"text":"Best coffee I've ever drank! They are at the top of the list! Like just in Arizona in the US! I've traveled all over the United States drinking coffee. And I must say I'm a Lola lover! Lol also I make my own coffee at home as well and I buy their beans. Not just that but their prices are fair 4.25$ for a large latte. If you haven't already tried them and love coffee you have to walk into this place at least once"}
{"text":"I come in here atleast once a week since it is on my way to work now. 
There was even a week that I came in every day.
Twice on one day.
Ok, ok! Three times! I COULDN'T HELP IT! Don't judge me.
I usually get either the Matador or the Cafe Caramel. I try to avoid the homemade espresso whipped cream like the plague but usually fail because it is ssoooo delicious. So delicious infact that I spell \"so\" with two S's and four O's.
What I do succeed at is not buying an entire plate of whatever flavor short bread cookies they have that day Those are even better than the whipped cream, but as they charge for the cookies and not the whipped cream, I have to exhibit a little self control. I have a little better self control when my money is involved (but not much).
Their poppy seed and strawberry muffins are amazing as is their quiche, but it's their short bread cookies that are life altering. Ok that may be a slight exaggeration, but I suspect it's laced with something addictive because I think about them ALL the time.
I love the decore here. I want one of their (what I assume to be reclaimed) wood tables in my apartment. I also am in love with the work of the artist on exhibit this month.
Usually I just look, but this time I might actually buy a piece or two. Really. 
So now that I write this, I sit at work staring at the clock waiting for my time to go home so I can stop by for a drink and cookie. This is going to be the slowest afternoon. Ever.
Oh and Nathan S., you better start checking in more. Your Dukedom is at stake and I want it!"}
{"text":"A-OK for a latte. The service was nice, and my latte arrived in a timely fashion. Not much different than any other major coffee chain - except one thing...

This, my dear friends, is a service industry. As such, I totally expect, and enjoy, tipping my barista whatever extra amount that is reasonable.

However, there was no tip jar. I find this disconcerting because it usually points to a micro-managing supervisor or some authoritarian policy that disallows hard working people who very likely make close to minimum wage from getting ahead.

What's the deal, Lola? You should allow customers who wish to tip their hard working barista and other staff if they want to. Owners and management must be real jerks.

To the staff who work here - I sure hope the management catches up to 2017 and allows customers like me who have worked in this industry before to tip you for your hard work!"}
{"text":"I've been to Lola Coffee a number of times and have tried several other local coffee bars in the area and Lola Coffee beats them all hands down. They roast their own beans and if you are an Americano lover, like myself, you won't find a better one around. 

The service is great and the barista's are friendly. 

The only drawback is it's so small to be so popular! 8-)"}
{"text":"I am a Starbucks SNOB. I do love to support local coffee shops but I absolutely have been a Starbucks fanatic forever. I gave Lola a try after a late lunch @ Pita Jungle. I was so impressed. I told the barista I was a vegan and she was able to veganise my white chocolate coffee (I think that was the name) by using different ingredients. AWESOME. I then went back a few days later and had the caramel coffee, delish! So good! I no longer have a craving for Starbucks, like at all!"}
{"text":"Great coffee and good sweets. The barista could be a bit more personable and less of a 'what do you want and please don't ask questions' personality."}
{"text":"The cafe blanco with homemade whip is the best drink ever! The atmosphere is a bit crowded but the coffee is worth it."}
{"text":"I love love love this place. I often treat myself a couple times a week to a coffee and danish. All the pastries are hadnmade in house and are the BEST you will ever taste. I could seriously eat a DOZEN of their cream cheese danishes in one sitting. 

I can't attest to a variety of coffees there because I always get the same thing; a drip coffee with a shot of vanilla. That alone is saying something because I typically prefer the usual fru-fru coffee. But their coffee is good enough that I don't see the need to jazz it up more than some simple vanilla and cream. The beans are all roasted in-house as well, nice touch, you can taste the difference. 

The atmosphere is hip. Its definitely no franchised Starbucks, and I love that. All around, I would go to Lola everyday if I could afford it! Alas, their prices are pretty much on-par with the rest of the nicer coffee shops. 

Stop in, get a cream cheese danish, and order yourself something where you can actually taste the coffee still.. Kick back and enjoy the ambiance."}
{"text":"Every time I think about this place I think about all the great music the Kinks played!
I loved their music and I love this coffee house.
The coffee is served exactly the way you want it and it tastes perfect.
The people who are there seem to understand the world.
The food offerings are wonderful and our group ate two different breakfast yummies-one of which had a decidedly Mexican flavor.
Parking can be difficult and the inside seating capacity is limited but the coffee experience is worth all the petty inconveniences.
Go for Lola and go for gold."}
{"text":"Good soy latte, bad blueberry scone. Latte was smooth & had the perfect combo of soy milk. The blueberry scone was dry and lacked flavor.  Also wasn't a fan of the sugar on top, graininess is never a good taste."}
{"text":"Coffee is great, good place to read or study. Just wish it were open longer at night and on weekends. Perhaps having the Pita Jungle open next door will increase foot traffic and thus demand. 

Free wifi."}
{"text":"soursdey! hip environment with Indy rock music, wifi included. chill hangout. bottled water limited to spring water. had the iced chai after a bit of walking and I'm refreshed!"}
{"text":"A coffee shop with great ambiance and skillful baristas. However, coffee is only as good as the beans and their beans are horrific. Although the texture of my flat white was perfect, the taste was so harsh as if the only note I could sense was carbon."}
{"text":"This place is so good. I love their huge art piece and it's a very homey vibe. It doesn't try too hard in terms of vibe, but it's very stylish and warm.

I had the iced mocha and after all the mochas I've had in California and Canada and even PNW in the last few months theirs was seriously so good and I actually could taste a significant difference between everything I've had. 

YUM. 

Also, we used street parking so, meters."}
{"text":"What I like abt Lola Coffee:
There are plenty of tables to sit at. If it gets too chilly inside bc of the a/c, you can sit at one of the many tables outside. There's free street parking and you can park in the gold parking garage right behind the coffee shop. It's brightly lit indoors. Lola coffee is next to a Pita Jungle and Painting Lounge."}
{"text":"10 out of 10! Fabulous coffee, great pastries and friendly service. If you're looking for a great espresso based drink and just enough hipster vibe, this is your place. They have a Lira espresso machine and their coffee beans are very well roasted (not burnt, not over roasted and not too floral/fruity). Baristas and cashiers were all friendly in the week I was here."}
{"text":"I love this place. It makes my weekly commute to downtown Phoenix something I look forward to. Excellent coffee. I can't get enough of the blueberry muffins or scones - such a hard decision that I often get one of each. :-) 
The service is great, friendly and very speedy. Often my coffee is ready before I finish picking out my treat and paying. Which is super helpful when you have to get to work."}
{"text":"Awesome group of ladies serving up great coffee. Amazing space and nice chill coffee shop vibe."}
{"text":"I liked the food. I had a vegetarian burrito with a chai. I like the location and aesthetics.  The person attended me could have been friendlier, I thought.  It seemed that my basic questions about the menu (it was my first time here) were a nuisance. I sat in the patio to enjoy my food. I would have enjoyed my experience if the customers were more ethnically diverse, though."}
{"text":"Lola is beautiful. It's been through my high school and college days and continues to be in my life post grad. Always lovely. Staff is kind and the people usually are too. 
There's parking in the structure right behind it!! Kind of confusing if you have never been. 
Their iced coffees are refreshing and the area is usually good for studying or working. I recommend weekday afternoons for work, weekends are a little crammed.¬†¬†
Patio is cute. Worth a visit !!! 

Don't recommend going to the alterations place right by it if that catches your attention like it did mine... lol really over priced and grumpy owner"}
{"text":"Cute little coffee shop in town. Very nice patio in the back to sit outside. The banana bread was great!"}
{"text":"Just when I thought I wouldn't find a coffee shop that wasn't a Starbucks, I saw the swirly letters of Lola beckoning to me like elegant, welcoming fingers. I just knew that there would be caffeinated delights waiting for me behind the glass door!

I haven't had an iced coffee since October. It's been a long, cold winter here in KC and for me, this means copious amounts of hot coffee. Being that in Phoenix it was in the 70s, I was happy to be able to have the taste of spring in an iced Americano with two raw sugars. They make a damn good cup here, plus the barista is super nice, even when inundated with non drip coffee orders. 

I had to take it to go, but I loved the cozy, rustic environment.  There's one large communal white wooden table, and then a bunch of smaller wood tables throughout the shop with metal chairs that conjure up images of a 1930s school house. When I was there the last week of January, they had a mesmerizing photography exhibit, with several enormous prints that I'm not going to even try explaining (I uploaded several pics). 

I have a strong feeling if I lived in Phoenix, this would be my go-to coffee shop for work, meetings, or just hanging out. And of course, getting that perfect cup to go."}
{"text":"Calling all coffee connoisseur's!! My tastebuds are out of control! I ordered the Iced Matador (with Whip Cream...get the whip cream) and oh my gosh was it delicious!! Everything about it was great from the perfectly roasted coffee with cinnamon flavor (very subtle) to the homemade whip cream! Delicious! customer service was nice, although they weren't very friendly (not the typical super welcoming, \"let's have a 20 minute conversation\" vibe). The entire space is basically one giant room with a huge patio in the back. Inside, the tables + chairs and couches are in a very tight space but once sitting down I didn't even notice how many seats were in this room as it didn't bother me as much as it did when I first walked in. This place is a little nosier than most coffee shops in the area, but not to the point where getting work done or having a conversation is un-bearable!

I would highly, highly, HIGHLY recommend Lola to any coffee freak/connoisseur!!"}
{"text":"My husband is from Raglan, NZ and he said Lola's had the best lattes he has ever had! My mocha was delicious too :) chocolate didn't over power the coffee.

If you get there early, they usually have banana bread or zucchini bread that tastes yummy."}
{"text":"I've been recently obsessed with checking out cute and trendy coffee shops in the downtown area and found Lola Coffee. Love the yellow walls and my latte and donut were perfect! The area outside is super cute for taking pictures and enjoying that caffeine fix! Love it"}
{"text":"Great coffee and amazing service.  This is the epicenter of Phoenix coffee culture!  Indeed the best of Phoenix."}
{"text":"Somewhere that can actually make proper foam not only out of regular milk but soy milk! Very good granola and Amish pastry. Definitely will be back in my next passing through of Phoenix! Great customer service as well."}
{"text":"Service is always welcoming.  Lucky to have a neighborhood cafe that serves your coffee with a smile and a \"Thank you\".

Favorite Drink is The Matador and you absolutely can't skip the whipped cream.

Pastries never an intention when I go in but always draw my eye and I'm sold.  They never disappoint"}
{"text":"I really like this atmosphere. Great looking art work to blend in with the feel of atmosphere. I tried the mocha and it tasted good. The customer service was good and friendly. This is a decent coffee shop and I would recommend it."}
{"text":"SO I went by this place with my dad after lunch today on my coffee tour of Phoenix!!! (ftw). This place is walking distance from my dad's office, so it was perfect as far as location goes. The inside is really nice, I like the decor and I think it feels comfortable. I got a latte and my dad got an iced mocha with whipped cream. Well they make their own whipped cream and it was really good! It has a little bit of chocolate and coffee in it. Yum. My latte was good, but was more milky than coffee -y. The espresso was a little weak. Overall, it was a really good cup of coffee though, and it ranks up there with the good coffee shops of phoenix. I would definitely go back. Also, they have the cutest pastries! they have little tarts and mini cupcakes and it all looks really good, but I didn't try one today because I had just eaten lunch. The prices were fair I thought. Overall, good place."}
{"text":"THE BEST ICED MOCHAS!!! HANDS DOWN! I'm an iced mocha fan and I'm always on the hunt for the most delicious well-bodied iced treat. I don't like when my mochas are sickly sweet and artificial tasting like Starbucks. I don't like when my mochas taste burned or over milky.... 

But Lola has it down! There is something so divinely wonderful about their iced mochas. A perfect balance of chocolate, coffee, and sweet. The best part is their home made whip cream which is truly heavenly."}
{"text":"Nice little coffee house. Historic bldg, industrial/funky relaxed atmosphere. Americano superb. Thumbs up"}
{"text":"Had my first Matador the other day and thought it pretty much rocked 

Unlike its sister shop on Central, this Lola keeps it simple with good coffee served by friendly staffers who spin vinyl at a reasonable volume. Reliable Wi-Fi, too.

This location is ideal for catching up with an old friend or relaxing with a magazine."}
{"text":"Best hot chocolate and breakfast quiche! Love the patio area. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite coffee shop downtown! They have the best combination of bold and mild beans. The coffee is always delicious hot or cold. The baristas know your order and are always friendly. The pastries are also fresh and yummy! I love Lola's coffee shop."}
{"text":"I had the matador.  It. Was. Bomb.  When the barista asks if you want whipped cream say yes.  Its like this, when you are going to pay $4 for coffee it better be good.  

The atmosphere is hipster, but not like they're trying too hard.  It's a nice place to hangout, or if the weather permits, walk around the neighborhood.  It's pretty.  

The only downside is that if you're not walking here, parking can be a challenge."}
{"text":"Okay GREAT coffee and whipped cream is home made. Honestly, I was blown away by the customer service. Both baristas (male and female) were SO NICE and friendly. I feel like it's really rare to have friendly staff at a coffee shop in Phoenix. The place was super clean and both employees were either cleaning or stocking stuff the whole time. I can really appreciate this because customer service is about 75% of my experience. Love this place and the friendly people here. I will definitely be coming here instead of the other popular coffee shops in the area."}
{"text":"Lola Coffee was yet another stop in my quest to find my favorite coffee shop in downtown Phoenix. Lola stands out for its large patio behind the building, dog friendliness, and plethora of breakfast options and baked goods. I've tried the scone and the Spanish tortilla. The Spanish tortilla is packed with potatoes and comes with a delicious aioli. It's probably my favorite coffee shop breakfast I've tried downtown. The coffee is strong and the iced lattes are smooth. It can feel a bit cramped inside, but there's plenty of seating outside. I'd come here for a drink to go, or to chat with friends, not so much for working."}
{"text":"I love this place so much that you can find me here every weekend at some point. It's amazing!"}
{"text":"The staff is friendly, the place is cute, there is a nice patio, everything is high quality, but the espresso just doesn't have a strong enough flavor for me. I'll have to come back and try a few more things, like the Matador everyone raves about, and that homemade whipped cream."}
{"text":"Oh no!  I should have updated this long, long ago.  Turns out I've been back.  (Reluctantly, I'd"}
{"text":"A great place to meet around downtown where you can actually get both a good cup of coffee and free parking! Went here to get some work done, and it was a little noisy in the late morning. It calmed down for a bit, but picked back up around lunchtime. I enjoyed my cafe au lait, and I was tempted by the baked goods but resisted (this time). I will have to go back again soon!"}
{"text":"Service was just ok, my iced coffee spilled all over and was given to me that way. Little things like this make want to not come back. There are tons of coffee places in Phoenix, why bother returning to a place that does not care much for presentation or a friendly staff."}
{"text":"Friendly service (with some fellow geocachers as baristas!), comfortable couches, and rich, creamy coffee.  I had the cafe au lait (pronounced \"oh-lay\" and not \"ow-lot\" for my fellow plebs), which had such great flavor that I didn't need to add any sugar.  Ask for it served in the \"for here\" cups!  If the weather is good (which it is often in Phoenix), you can sit outside on the back porch and enjoy the warmth.  Lola Coffee has some of the best-tasting coffee I've found yet in Phoenix.  The food offerings are also pretty strong; instead of just serving up sugary pastries, Lola has quiche and tortilla espanola, which is a potato-and-veggie-filled quiche-like dish.  I had a cup of coffee and breakfast at Lola's the other day before work, and it was a great way to wake up and begin my day.  5/5 stars from me!"}
{"text":"A surprising discovery at the Sky Harbor Airport! Took a friend to the airport, walked with her to the gate and realized there was still time before she had to go through security. That's when the aroma of coffee both hit us. Looked around and found Lola Coffee.

Doesn't have that burnt, over-roasted coffee flavor like some self-proclaimed coffee Star offers. Anyone with a sweet tooth will DEFINITELY like this!  I had the Caf√© Blanco and it was delicious!

Places with outlets to plug in a laptop for work and comfy chairs for relaxing. Service was great too. I will admit: there weren't many people around when we stopped. Might get crazy during traditional air travel hours.

Not a five-star 'cause we didn't order a meal or pastry (yeah, difficult to imagine that, but we were both full from lunch. I had a salad, which was shocking for both of us).

This will be my coffee fix anytime I'm at the airport."}
{"text":"Before today, I would have rated this place a 2 or a 3.  I'm not a HUGE fan of their coffee, and their internet always seemed to be extremely slow (even when there were only 2 of us in there).  But, their pastries were always great, especially the shortbread.
I'm from Portland, so I can be pretty picky about my coffee.  Today was not an exception either.  The coffee had way too much of an acidic taste, like they pulled the shot and let it sit there or something.  The reason I gave it 4 stars today is their internet is blazing fast with about 10 laptops out.  I haven't had an issue yet.  And I can always get the iced tea..."}
{"text":"This place seems to be everything you'd want in your neighborhood coffee joint. I've only been once and I had an iced mocha (yeah, that's right). The coffee was delicious and to top it off, literally, the whipped cream (yeah, that's right) was infused with espresso. 

The atmosphere caters to the downtown hipster, wifi set. Which is smart 'cause if you've got fast throughput and good joe they'll lurk and linger in droves, doling our ducats all the while. It probably rates a five star review but I just did a hit and run."}
{"text":"great place to just relax have some peace and quiet and best of all enjoy an amazing lattee and awesome snacks that they have. Great selection and great quality would recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"The service was great and the espresso laced whip cream was yummy but they failed to stock more food for us hungry travelers. No flat bread and she was unable to make cheese omlets. Plus, the quiche had pork. Bummer!"}
{"text":"This place is a total gem in downtown Phoenix. The coffee is STRONG and wonderful and the food (croissants, doughnuts, muffins, etc) tastes like what I had back in New York. 

The space is bright and open - the exact type of place I want to hang out on a Sunday morning."}
{"text":"Meh, the iced green tea was refreshing, and husband reports the coffee was \"fine\", but as a person who likes to park and play at coffee shops this spot was unmemorable and a bit cramped. Probs better for grab and go type coffee adventures, otherwise everyone can see all the weird shit you're shopping on Amazon for."}
{"text":"Decided to stop by Lolas after we were unsuccessful in navigating to a nonexistent juice bar, cozy little place but not too many options besides coffee lover stuff. . . #TEAMTEA"}
{"text":"Came here after my flight to get some ice tea. First off if you are gonna me open 24/7 as they say then you should also have things in stock. They didn't have the iced green or black tea available. They made the hot green tea to pour it over ice, but didn't wait for it to brew. Now pretty much all I have is warm water. The only reason I even gave it any higher than 1 star is because the guy behind me decided to buy my drink."}
{"text":"1st Time here and already love it! As soon as you walk in you walk into a coffee oasis!! The smell is so strong and Delicious it just makes you love coffee even more. I got their dirty chai and it tasted pretty good. The espresso shots in there had a bold taste which I love! There's lots of seating space so it's awesome to come and hang out. The crowd of people it attracts is pretty cool. Definitely my kind of vibe."}
