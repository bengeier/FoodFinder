{"text":"I was in Cleveland For Easter  and wanted to get some yummy desserts I went to Mazzone and saw what I thought would be perfect a.  Carrot Cake ,which had  the most disturbing Cream Cheese Frosting, I think it was made with Canned shortening the Taste was awful.   Kolaches   They looked great but were drier than the Mohave Desert .  Poppy Seed and Nut Roll Danishes Moderate taste. Grand total   $62.00.  All said Bad experience. STICK WITH THE PIZZA AND LEAVE THE DESSERTS TO SILLY FOLKS FROM OUT OF TOWN."}
{"text":"I have been to this bakery 2 times in 5 years.  Both times, Ive been waited on by un-friendly staff.   Seems like they could be a little nicer.  
The pizza is really good and the french bread was yummy.  
Just sad that I spend good money at a place that treats you like \" what did you come in here for?\""}
{"text":"I absolutely love this pizza. Growing up in an Italian family, this reminds me so much of the pizza my mom used to make on Saturday nights. Thick and bready, it's smothered in a tangy tomato sauce and a layer of crusty melted Parmesan cheese. Eat it cold or at room temp-I don't think heating it will improve it at all, it's already perfection.
It's nothing like the pizza most people are used to- no stretchy mozzarella, no fancy toppings, just simple bready goodness. mmmmmmm...."}
{"text":"A staple of all of my childhood's family celebrations was Mazzone pizza.    I love it, and it is one of the things I miss about Cleveland.  I now live in the Western US and have traveled the world -- including Italia itself. But  Mazzone's thick crust and unbelievable cheese and tomato sauce -- it is heaven on earth!   I am glad this COLD pizza is still around.

{"text":"This is the kind of place that just makes me happy. The pizza, as mentioned by other yelpers, is served at room temperature (and I am assuming it would be sacrilegious to reheat?). The woman who helped me was very nice. The only weird thing is that she stopped helping me to help a man behind me, who according to her, had a \"difficult time\" on his first visit when a woman in front of him was very indecisive. Hmmm. This reeks a little bit of sexism and/or over-generalization. I was taking my time looking, but still, I was in the middle of telling her my order. Anyway,  once I got home and tasted that pizza, I really couldn't be mad anymore. Plus, I got this cake that was just so moist and delicious -- it was a mini cake that was covered in chocolate frosting and coconut, with half chocolate cake and half yellow cake & buttercream inside. I MEAN.... how could this not be amazing?

Anyway, I may just have to make a return visit...like...today. This time I'll make sure to step out of the way of any self-important men. Just kidding. They can deal with it."}
{"text":"Had a gift certificate and decided to finally use it.  The place only had parking for two cars, and while parking my car set off their automatic door.
The lady at the counter was very nice and friendly. I got a strudel(tasty but not much filling), seeded rye bread (it was good) 2 little individual cheesecake squares (those were so good) a pizza bread (tasty, but too much sauce for me, but friends liked it like that and finished my part), and that came to a little over $25.  For the cheesecake, I'll definitely come back here."}
{"text":"I grew up on the far west side, and have lived my entire adult life away from Cleveland. I lived 30 years in Pizza meccas - Chicago, New York and New Jersey. While pizza purists may suggest that it is not classic pizza, it is AMBROSIA. I have not tasted anything in the category that matches it in my travels (50 states and 17 countries). Amazingly there are Clevelanders who have not tried the pizza.

This pizza ranks highly among the signature dishes of America; Chicago hot dogs, New Orleans gumbo and jambalaya, New England clam chowder, Philly cheese steaks, New York bagels, Cincinnati chili, Kentucky burgoo, and barbecue by region.

At any rate, do yourself a favor and try it. I have never met anyone who did not love it."}
{"text":"pizza is great served cold....sauce is a little heavy and quite rich..... you will get indigestion for sure after eating a hefty slice, but overall a great pizza..."}
{"text":"I drive by mazzones a lot.  It's close to where I live and where I work.  Everytime I drive by I think...Hmmm it's time to stop back in and when I do force myself to pull up, I always leave wondering why I don't come back more often.  The pizza, in my opinion, is ok.  The lady in charge actually referred to it as a pizza bread rather than pizza because it is quite thick.  I liked it better after putting it in the toaster oven.  
The kolachkes (sp?) were really good.  They were buttery and had a little spice in them.  I would order them again.  
Everything there looks so tempting it's hard not to order a ton.  However, their cash only policy helps.  Also for a small neighborhood bakery, their prices are a little higher than expected.  Overall though, it's a pretty great place with some really tempting items."}
{"text":"The cheesecake squares are great. I have yet to try their famous pizzas. Some of the other sweets are hit or miss. I wouldn't buy their cookies, Russian tea biscuits or brownies again but I do stop here with some frequency for the cheesecake squares. The texture and sweetness are perfect. The portion is also pretty generous."}
{"text":"I grew up in Cleveland but now live in LA.  A coworker just asked me what Cleveland was famous for in the category of food and my mouth instantly started watering as I now dream of Mazzone's cold sheet pizza.  Thick soft bread, piled high with sauce and crisp cheese, served COLD.  When will I be home for Christmas?  Dear Dad, please drive out of our suburb and into Cleveland the morning I arrive so I can devour 12 pieces of this as soon as I get home. 

If you live in Cleveland and have never been to Mazzone's, we can no longer be friends."}
{"text":"Love coming here very friendly, I've been coming here off & on since I can remember, they have a very unique pizza served at room temp or chilled which I love. The doughnuts are to die for, the sugar raised are my moms favorite I always take her a few when I go, the French bread is delicious I always get 2/3 it doesn't last long, my favorite is making homemade French bread pizza with it,  the sliced twist bread is also a family favorite, I wish they would make pepperoni bread/roll last time I had one was in the late 70's early 80's."}
{"text":"Been eating their pizza for almost 60 years and it's still among the very best I've had ANYWHERE in the country, including NY, SFO, Boston, LA, wherever! I think the city should proclaim this place a Cleveland Historical Landmark because when it comes to pizza, this place has earned it.  Their other products are all very good, from cookies to bread, to donuts (yum) to, well, everything. LONG LIVE MAZZONE'S!!!"}
{"text":"My first visit was impeccable! I never heard of a place serving up cold/room temp slices of pizza! When I heard about Mazzone's doing just that I was in my car less than 24 hours later for a breakfast journey that would take over an hour to get there and back. I drove a lot faster on the way home. My friends call me the pizza king for a reason. My blood was boiling at the fact that I had pizza in the passenger seat waiting on me. I had to get home immediately! I'm not sure anybody will ever understand my passion for pizza! 

The only bad part about this pizza was the drive home! I'll be honest, it wasn't the way the pizza looked that had my taste buds salivating with anticipating temptation. It was the reviews, the conversation with yelper \"Alan S.\" and the talk on the phone with the Mazzon'es employee who told me about the process and how people come from out of state to try it. Ok now let's get into the review...

Their pizzas are baked in the morning from scratch and then set out to cool. If you are looking for that hot melted cheesy gooey pizza then this isn't the place for that. If you want that delicious slice of morning pizza at room temperature without sacrificing freshness then this is the place! This isn't the same as ordering pizza, leaving it out and eating it the next day. It's much better and fresher than that! When I took my first bite with high expectations I wasn't disappointed. It was like somebody pulled the fluffiest cloud from heaven, covered it in a sauce with so many distinct flavors, topped it off with some sprinkles of cheese, baked it and left it out for me to come along and have a slice. The bread is ridiculously soft and fluffy and their sauce is perfection at room temperature. I wouldn't even think to heat this pizza up. Some things are just better served cold. Mazzone's has perfected a cold pizza so cold-blooded it will kill the competition! Go see for yourself if you don't believe me!"}
{"text":"Nice family-run bakery on Clark in Cleveland.  They have a nice selection of bread, cakes and other treats, and they make everything in-house.  It seems like a great place to order a cake from for a party, and their bread was great."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Cleveland, hands down! There is nothing like a trip down \"nostalgia\" lane like room temp/cold, delicious, savory, pizza pie. I know it sounds crazy, but it really is the tastiest, and you gotta try it!"}
{"text":"What's not to like about this great neighborhood bakery. 

Always friendly and the smells of oven fresh goodness hit you smack dab in your olfactory system when you walk in the door. 

Try one of everything but my favorite is the cannoli and my husband's is the pizza."}
