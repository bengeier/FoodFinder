{"text":"I have been to Bropards a couple times with friends and have enjoyed it very much. I enjoyed the karaoke and dancing there. I like the food but the menu is somewhat limited and has entrees that do not exactly fit my dietary needs otherwise I would give it a better score. Chicken Adobo or Pork & Pimentos or even Pork with Mungo Beans would be nice or Chicken Long Rice would be good additions. I do like the chicken wings though and the service is attentive."}
{"text":"Nice, cozy place to hang out and enjoy Filipino style food and stand up comedy/karaoke."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a home away from home style comedy bar, this is the place to be. The place is outstanding. The food is exceptional. The staff is very well trained. Order their sizzling sisig, lechon cebu style and a bucket of beer, take a seat and enjoy the fun and laughter. Meet new friends or just enjoy the night. This is my favorite local spot in Las Vegas."}
