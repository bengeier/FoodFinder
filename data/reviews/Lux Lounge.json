{"text":"Came here on Victoria Day on a Monday during vacation. It was hard looking for a place because it was a Monday and it was a holiday. We found this place and it was empty but that didn't throw us off because we make the party we don't need anyone else. The bartender Sammy was super nice. It was a group of 6 and we were all drinking a lot, we ended up getting 2 rounds free. I would definitely come back. Don't let the bad reviews lure you away."}
{"text":"this place is the worst hooka place i have ever been to, and ive been to  a lot of different ones across america. Lux lounge is filled with a bunch of 18 years old wanna bes. The staff has no regards for new clients, what so ever. First of all, they overcharged us for bottleservice promised we would get our own booth then mixed us up with a bunch of 18 years old hoodlums. How akward?? these people came and sat next to us with theyre feet laying on \"our\" table. We then asked to speak with the owner who told us they were regulars and that they could basicly do as they pleased, even though they never got bottle service or what so ever. New clients, do not com here!!!@ big mistake!"}
{"text":"Lux lounge opened 7 months ago at the time of writing, and they are one of the freshest, best Shisha lounges in Montreal. From the futuristic lighting to the beautiful landscape of the Montreal skyline, this place is everything I've ever wanted out of a shisha joint.  If you're serious about your Shisha, you know starbuzz. They carry starbuzz flavors, so knock yourself out. Their Shisha pipes are excellent quality, many are imported from Turkey and Egypt for your smoking pleasure.  Note that you'll get the herbal crap by default. Go for the starbuzz if you want to avoid a buzz kill.  Lux lounge has really friendly staff, too. They get your Shisha lit and started and check up on it from time to time.  Excellent tea, by the way, we all enjoyed it.  They also have a full bar, which is a bit of a rarity at Shisha lounges, so another plus point.  The music is straight gangster and very chill.  Last but not least they have something called \"bitches night\". We find it awesome that their staff has the balls to call it bitches night, and that's what put them over the edge to five star status.  I love the vibe here, for me there is no other shisha place in Montreal, the others are all dead to me now.  Try it out, and have a great time!"}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE!  This place was completely empty. The owner charged me and my friend $20 for admission and coat check to get into a ghost of a place. We asked for our money back after 2 seconds of seeing that NO ONE was there at 12:45 pm... and they refused.  Never have I been so disappointed in a night club in Montreal. I am from Vancouver, Canada and visit often ..tonight I was showing my friend from the USA a good time and this place was just a disappointment and the owner really pissed me off - they will clearly shut down soon enough. Bub bye Lux, never again.  If you're smart, you will heed this advice and look elsewhere."}
{"text":"I can't definitely say this would be a second visit back! It was pretty dead only for the sake of it being Monday and a holiday. Entering, we were greeted in a courser manner , very friendly and made it comfortable for us. He even played a couple good songs to vibe to! At one point he even gave us a round on him and a second because of how much great vibes we brought to the bar. Shots after shots, Long Island after Long Island, MONTREAL and this bar was great! I appreciate such personality and culture they bring amongst a diverse place. I amongst my friends  will definitely be coming back! Never underestimate a place with low or high volume, because the service and kindness can always bring you a great experience to live for."}
{"text":"It says hookah lounge but they don't have hookah. 2 star only cause place looked ok. Dude was rude, like it's my fault that they don't have hookah."}
{"text":"This place is such a great lounge if you just want a \"chill\" night with the friends. It's got great music (a mix of current & older), a fun ambiance. Their drink menu is pretty diverse, and their cocktails are delicious! You can have a hookah (sheesha) aswell. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Pourquoi mettre l'entrée d'un bar à chicha à 15$ après 0h un vendredi soir ?! Vous ne vous faites pas assez de profits avec vos chichas à 20/25$ et vos cocktails. J'ai vraiment pas trouvé raisonnable le prix à l'entrée du bar, ça m'est resté en travers de la gorge.   Mais on s'est tout de même bien amusé, une vrai ambiance, le DJ toujours aussi bon avec une session reggae que j'ai particulièrement apprécié et mon mojito : parfait. Dommage qu'il manque pas mal de places assises aussi, t'es obligé d'en piquer chez les autres.. Mais on va faire avec lol !"}
