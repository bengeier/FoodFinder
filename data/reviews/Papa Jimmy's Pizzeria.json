{"text":"I want to support this local business but I can't. Quality and value have both dropped precipitously in recent years.  Ingredients don't seem fresh, pizza dough is mediocre and prices are well above average."}
{"text":"Their service is never the best. No one is friendly. The pizza is pretty good."}
{"text":"Took the family in on our way out to visit family in CG.  Ordered a large regular crust with Canadian bacon.  I was good with the taste.  Pizza wasn't cut all the way through and with the bacon being underneath the cheese, it lead to a couple slices coming off the pan naked.  A bit of handy work and all was fine.  Overall, decent.  $18 for a large one topping."}
{"text":"$28 for two 10 in thin crust pizzas, for that price you would be thinking that you were getting gourmet from scratch extremely fresh ingredients. Not the case! We ordered a veggie pizza, black olives were spoiled, smelled awful, tasted even worse, hardly any cheese, not to mention all of the other ingredients seemed to come from a can. We also ordered a taco pizza, which only came with a tiny bit of refried beans, lettuce, tomato, and crumbled doritos. No cheese, no salsa, not sauce, no sour cream! WEAK

I would have rather bought 2 jack's frozen pizzas and doctored them up myself for 1/8 the price. This food is awful, overpriced, and just plain garbage. AVOID AT ALL COST!"}
{"text":"I had a coupon to get a pizza for 50% off, so I gave them a try.....i overpaid.

The flavour was average, the size of the pizza was ok, but only because i got offer with half price.  If I paid full price for for this pizza, I would have been upset.  Pizza Hut and dominos have basically the same quality, if not slightly better, for $8.  Why would anyone pay three times that for one of these pizzas?

Go someone else, pay less, be happier."}
{"text":"I have family that lives right up the street, and my uncle believes in supporting local shops over corporate restaurants, which is how I came by Papa Jimmy's. After spending a whole day swimming around, no one really wanted to cook so we ordered a few specialty pizzas, and I am a fan! The crust and sauce are delicious, and I prefer their Mac n Cheese pizza over some of the competing pizza places. The new digs from their previous location is pretty sweet, and I also love that they provide Chocolate Shoppe ice cream."}
{"text":"Very good pizza:).  Order at least one a month for my grooming salon in town.  LOVE the side salads I get as well!"}
{"text":"Their pizza is really good, sauce, toppings are all top notch
Ordered by phone for pickup and was ready and hot on time
Pizzas seem a little small for the cost though
Person who took order wasn't super friendly and counter person wasn't overly upbeat but got what I ordered and was satisfied"}
{"text":"Their Italian beef sub is amazing. I've eaten at all the Chicago area beef joints and this was superior the bread is incredible. Best Italian beef I've had in Wisconsin by a long shot. Nice staff, nice dining room."}
{"text":"Overpriced and only the thin crust is worth ordering. Too much money for average pizza.  Primarily go there for there for an occasional ice cream cone."}
{"text":"My brother and I have been coming to Pj's since we were little kids. For years all we got was ice cream and some rounds at the arcade, and it would have earned 7 stars back then. But now that we're older and we've started branching out into their pizza and calzones....3 stars for the nostalgia and ice cream is all I can muster. The service is friendly and helpful, but ticket times are horrendous. It took an hour for them to make me a calzone, no exaggeration. We timed it. Their pizza is quite awful and very expensive, and I recommend dabbing it down with a couple napkins before eating to soak up all the grease. Pizza is greasy, sure, but this is insane. They also used to sell soda by the pitcher when you ate in the dining room, but now they give you a glass that has one free refill at the fountain. The atmosphere is really nice, feels more like a sports bar than a family restaurant but it's still plenty family friendly. They have their awesome ice cream counter with hefty servings for the price, always freezing cold and deliciously fresh. They play good music and always have a game on the tv. Definitely stop in for some ice cream and maybe a soda, but avoid the actual food."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, the building was converted from an old car wash. The pizza is decent. Cheeseburger pizza is our favorite, it's really really good."}
{"text":"I think I'm falling out of love with Papa Jimmy's. I've been realizing lately that the main reason I support them is to support a local business over a chain. I'm not sure that's enough. The pizza is fine, but it isn't great. It is very expensive compared to other pizza places around town, even places with much better pizza. Their vegetarian sandwich is basically a salad on toasted bread - very disappointing. The salad bar sometimes looks less than fresh. The staff often seems more interested in socializing than helping customers, although they are generally very nice. 

Twice in recent memory there have been problems with my delivery order. Once the pizza was just wrong and the second time my order was much later than expected. When I called to check the status (well after the delivery window I was given) I was told that the pizza oven had broken but that they had \"figured something out\" to get my order out anyway. It turned out fine, but wasn't a very reassuring answer. You would think they could at least offer a coupon for your next order when something like that happens, but they do not."}
{"text":"Order here regularly and really like it. When I call to place my order, the staff is always helpful and previous orders are on deck for easy reorder (Ex: they note if you asked for \"no tomatoes\" last time). Food is always ready within 20 minutes. Have had several of their specialty pizzas and subs and have been happy each time."}
{"text":"We got married at the oaks golf course in June and we had Papa Jimmy's deliver pizza to our reception for a late night snack. We ordered 20 pizzas and wanted them delivered at 10pm. They did an awesome job! The delivery guy was right on time and every one of the 20 pizzas was right out of the oven hot. We recived a lot of comments from our wedding guests on how awesome the pizza was. I would highly recommend them for similar events and will definitely be getting their pizza again."}
{"text":"It's strange that there are so many bad reviews. I've never had an issue and the food has always been excellent and exactly as I ordered."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with the way I was treated my first time ordering from this restaurant.
After buying a coupon book to support our local high school baseball team, I decided to use a coupon that entitled me to a free order of small breadsticks with any large pizza. I told the man over the phone that I had the coupon, and he quoted me $14 and some odd cents for my order. But when the delivery driver showed up, he told me it was $21. I asked why it was so much, and he said the man on the phone forgot to add something to my bill. I should have looked it over more carefully before I signed it, but I signed it anyway and then reviewed the receipt in my home.
The restaurant charged me for a large order of breadsticks with my pizza. I called to explain their mistake and to ask for the $6 back that they charged me for the breadsticks. A very rude and inexperienced young girl was not helpful or courteous to me, did not apologize for the mistake, and told me she could refund me $3.50 which would be the difference between a small and large order of breadsticks. I tried to explain that I didn't order a large breadstick; I ordered a small FREE one with my coupon. She put me on hold for a moment and then came back and said she could refund me$3.50 because quote \"we can't just give you free food\".
I was appalled! I said I was not asking for free food asked to speak to the manager immediately. The manager did not apologize either, and instead of refunding money back to my credit card gave me CREDIT (of $3.50 and not $6) for my next pizza. Why would I want credit if I am never going to order from them ever again?? I don't appreciate being treated that way. Also, their food is not that good."}
{"text":"This was our first time trying this place. We ordered a Hawaiian pizza and breadsticks. After a couple bites my husband and I decided this was the worst pizza we had ever had. (I am sorry!!!).  The ingredients just weren't fresh or something. All the flavor was noon existent. Sauce has no flavor, breadsticks literally were just bread.  Just no good.

I will say that the friendly staff at the pick up window and who took our order brought the review from 1 to 2 stars.  I sincerely want to support local business, but we won't buy that pizza again. Sorry!"}
{"text":"Tasty pizza and nice atmosphere. Be warned that soft drinks get one free refill.  We had the cheese breadstick appetizer and BBQ chicken pizza. Both were tasty. The Mac n Cheese pizza is our family favorite and ice cream cones for dessert- yum!"}
{"text":"Papa jimmy is a cheap s.o.b that will weigh your ice cream and charge extra for bottled water instead of watered down fountain drinks. The employees look like they just spent a month in one of hitlers concentration camps. The food is pretty horrible and the owner is a dick. Won't be back"}
{"text":"Terrible service, the owner nickel and dimes you on everything. Even charges more for a \"to go\" cup."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here several times and always order the BBQ chicken pizza. I don't remember there ever being mushrooms on it so we walked in and ordered when we got our pizza it was loaded with mushrooms. Who puts mushrooms on BBQ chicken pizza? So when I went up to talk to them I asked for a manager, so this young kid (there were no adults there, just all kids working) comes up with a smirk on his face and says there are mushrooms on our pizza. I am like seriously, you are not willing to do a thing to satisfy one of your customers? We will NEVER go back there again. There is no such thing as good customer service at this restaurant."}
{"text":"The place is clean and updated, which is a plus, but everything else was sort of lacking.  The service was slow, the food was mediocre."}
{"text":"This is our family's go to pizza place. The magic is in their specialty pizzas. The Cheeseburger pizza is a refreshing twist on a pizza and great for the summer. The Taco Pizza is my personal favorite. It is better than the Pizza Hut version in my opinion. Calzones are solid, plus they have ice cream!!"}
