{"text":"Tried Pineapple fried rice. I would prefer less sweet, or add some spice. Meal size is big and only $9.35."}
{"text":"Imperial Garden...i have a love/hate relationship with you!!!

-Your Chili Shrimp taste pretty yummy
-My company adores the chili chicken...believes that is better then Frederiks & Lin Garden (likes that there is a lot of sauce and chicken...)
-Service is very good..always checking up on us and refilling the water
-Veggie Spring Rolls are small yet delish!
-Menu is affordable...esp the lunch specials


-HOWEVER, you do lose 1 star. why you may ask? What is the use of having a phone number when NO ONE ever PICKS UP THE PHONE?? I wanted to order take out so many times in the past and no one ever answers the phone. I come there in person (because the my company absolutely wants your chili chicken).....and it's not busy there....

Is it so hard to answer to phone? *sigh"}
{"text":"Rude staff.  Horrific customer service and awful food......the rice was cold and stale. Very soggy n sticky.  The chicken was undercook n gave us all dysentery.   Pls don't eat here it's garbage. Putrid food."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best Hakka restaurants in Scarborough! The portions are big and the food tastes great."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick, grab something to go. 
The decor isn't anything to write home about, but, it sure seems about a hundred times cleaner than Sinopino, across the parking lot.
Went for the Manchurian Chicken on rice. Decent portion size, for a decent price.
The sauce was more tomato based, than I've had at other places. Different, for me, but, a tasty variation."}
{"text":"Awesome food!!!!!!!!  Excellent staff!!!!  (esp. Jesse!!!)   Very clean, great prices, always greeted with a BIG smile, friendly, courteous and knowledgeable staff, VEGAN friendly!!!!!!!!  What more can I say?!!!!!!  My fiancee and I eat here all the time!!!!!

HIGHLY recommended!!!!!!!!!        : )"}
{"text":"SPICEY GARDEN.
Food quality - food is really nice.  This resturant is very consistent with quality. Always amazing.

Portions- most times consistent with portions.  One meal will fill you up. 

Price - one meal ranges from 7 to 10 bux plus tax. 

Overall a decent resturant. People there are friendly. Wife and I go there regularly. 

Only problem I have is that when I order manchurian rice they are very cheap on giving meat. If you want extra it's 1 or 2 bux more.  So for that I can't give a perfect score."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch. For $6.99 you get:

- 1 Dish (list of about 25~30 to choose from)
- 1 Bowl of rice
- 1 Bowl of Hot and Sour Soup
- 1 Mini Spring roll

Went there with a friend and got two specials.  one with chilli chicken and one with spicy garlic chicken.

Chilli chicken was pretty good however the garlic spicy chicken was kind of bland.  it's basically fried chicken pieces with garlic/vinegar/sugar sauce.

it's a great deal for that kind of price but certainly nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Very good customer service. The servant was very friendly, and fast in serving.
Food was ok. The food is Halal, the place was clean."}
{"text":"What a gem!  I had no idea this place was here though I've always gone to another restaurant in the same small forgettable plaza for dim sum.  I have to caution that this is the first time I've ever had Hakka food so I really have nothing to compare this against, but boy, I'm so glad I came here!

The service was excellent, with very friendly and thoughtful servers who came to check on us every so often and who remembered my brother as having been there before.  The place was very clean, with definite thought given to decor with all the IKEA hanging lampshades they were using.  On to the food!

I had the spicy garlic chicken 'combo' which came with 2 spring rolls and a bowl of fried rice.  Super saucy with breaded chicken with a spicy kick - and super yummy as well.  I'm sure my stomach is currently glowing neon red from the plentiful sauce right now.  I also tried out my fellow diners' chili chicken and paneer with chili. Both were also unexpectedly delicious.  The paneer was breaded which I wasn't used to, but I guess that's how it is - didn't deter me from enjoying every firm and faintly cheesy bite.  To end off, we all shared a deep fried banana dessert with vanilla ice cream which was just the perfect sweet and cooling way to end off a spicy, fragrant meal.

This place is a great value for money, with a good selection of items on their menu.  It's not overly crowded, the portion sizes are good and the food is just great.  Combined with the very very good service, I'd definitely be coming again!"}
{"text":"We were in the neighbourhood and wanted something quick, stopped by at this busy plaza where parking seems to be too tight. 

The restaurant does not have decor inside to speak. At 2 pm on a weekend it was empty. 

Ordered a Schewan Vegetable Fried Rice and a Paneer Chilli. The Paneer Chilli was delicious. A bit to much for some tastes. The paneer battered and deep fried and onions still had a crunch. The quantity was disappointing though, too less!  The fried rice good, but had only broccoli sit seemed. Would have preferred more mixed veggies rather. 

Good for takeout but sit in, not so sure."}
{"text":"For the price point, you can't beat it. Best in Scarborough. The lunch special is a great deal."}
{"text":"I guess they changed the name of this place....now its called Spicy Garden.  We came here for a late dinner with the family.  If you're looking for great Hakka Food, and dont care much about the ambience, then this is your place.  Though a few light fixtures were fused, or off, the food made up for the lack of atmospheric lusture.  

Overall: 
food:  4/5 chili chicken, crispy beef, mandarin fish, and chicken pakoras.
atmosphere: 2/5: dark spots in the restaurant, some lights not working, they need to change the ceilings, it looked grungy.
service:5/5 very polite, knowledgable, and very very accomodating. 

final! 3.5/5"}
{"text":"My meal was fantastic.  Egg flower mushroom soup (size small) was too much for me to finish as an appetizer.  It was served piping hot and was really good.  

Hubby ordered chicken pakoras which were served with over 15 pieces - again another large appetizer but left overs are amazing so we didn't hesitate to order.  These taste great, a little spicy on their own but can also be complimented well with the yellow sauce in the mustard tube on the table....still not sure what that stuff was but it was good.

Speaking of condiments on the table, there was this chopped jalapeno sauce that blew my taste buds out.  I love spicey food but here's a warning - only taste if you can take extremely hot stuff.

Chilli Chicken (2 L's)......was the reason we came here.  It was super good and now I understand what another yelper meant when they said it's more saucey and has more chicken than other places. You get lots of chicken on this plate - you will not go hungry.  The sauce is thinner and not as spicy as my favorite chilli chicken place (China Cottage).  However, it stands on its own and is reeeeeeally delicious.  It did not disappoint at all!  I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I have tried other Hakka places in Scarborough/ Markham area but the food at Spicy Garden is the best by far. The ambiance was really chill, clean and did not smell bad. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Okay honestly, I used to work like 5 minutes away from this restaurant + whenever my coworkers and I craved hakka food we would choose to either sit in and eat or take out. I would've gave 4 stars IF we all didn't see what we seen....

During our last visit, we decided to do take out and we seen 2 cockroaches near the kitchen (we are able to see the kitchen door and in it from the booth where you pick up/pay). We were so disgusted that we didn't even want to eat the food!! I really hope they do something about it."}
{"text":"I first gave this place a 5 star and then took 1 off and i will tell explain why later. 

Pros - awesome awesome awesome food. Great price. Great portions. You will not be disappointed at all. The service is good. Make sure you try the chili-chicken. I don't know how they make it so good. Its really juicy and flavorful. If you can seriously handle spice then try their hot sauce. Its really different! 

Cons - It looks very dull and unappealing. They could do with some renovations but its not really necessary. 

Why did i give it 4 stars instead of 5?  They have changed the way they make their \"Hakka noodles\". Every Indian knows how Hakka noodles \"smells\" and tastes like. Its has a smokey smell and taste. This was the 1 place where i found the same flavor and scent but last time when i ate here the noodles tasted different. The smokey-ness is not there any more. I HOPE they go back to the previous method of cooking...:S"}
