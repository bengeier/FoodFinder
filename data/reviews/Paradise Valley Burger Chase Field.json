{"text":"Customer service skills of some of the employees are lacking. The girl who took my order had a severe attitude, when I asked for just fries she thought I said two when I only said one and had to correct her. When I did, she gave me a very rude look. The fries were excellent, and the burgers looked very good! But the service wasn't as good as it could be."}
{"text":"Hands down the Brûlée burger (I requested no fried egg) was fantastic! Best burger of my life. The torched sugar on the open face of the bun left it crispy on the inside soft on the outside! Seriously an amazing feed! Seasoned crispy thin cut fries and a maple bacon milkshake topped it all off."}
{"text":"Definitely obsessed with this baseball food- I've tried the bell rd location and enjoyed it. Why not try it at the ballpark?  I wonder how they managed to kick it up a notch at the field adding Americas tacos instead of macayos and bring this local gem to baseball fans.  The food here is great of course burgers being the star.  The beach burger is my style but we tried that last time so we opted for the Texas BBQ burger.  Um,  HELLO.  Wish I could detail every topping all I know is- bacon and cheese always win.  The BBQ sauce glazed burger patties took me to my childhood backyard.    Truly the French toast fries were my favorite of the day compared to the carne asada nachos, and cold stone creamery.   I mean how do they beat ice cream??? The hot fried brioche dipped in maple sauce just satisfied that inner fat kid.  Sharing these is advised! The best part is they are served hot and complimented the BBQ burger nicely!  Take my out to the ball game because I want another burger & French toast fry experience."}
{"text":"Try the Texas BBQ! 2 beef patties, bbq sauce, roasted green chili, crisp bacon and shaved smoked mozzarella. Best BASEBALL BURGER OF all time."}
{"text":"Very tasty food! The BBQ burger was unbelievable! Fries are to die for! Just the right amount of seasoning. Is very pricy in all."}
{"text":"I love that this place opened here! The beach house is my favorite. And their fries with that bbq seasoning is amazing. Beer + beach house + fries = bombsauce. Eat here or I'll punch you in the face."}
{"text":"Extremely slow service.  The price on the menu board did not equal the price we were charged.  When we pointed that out the girl said that the price on menu was incorrect and there was nothing she could do.  We asked for the manager and some crazy dude behind the counter started laughing all psychotically.    The burgers here are over double the price of the actual restaurant location.  Not going to give this place my money.  Save yourself the time and effort."}
{"text":"This place was a surprising find! We walked a loop around the whole park and stopped here for burgers. It was delicious! Must try the sweet po tots!! So good and they have bacon ranch and jalapeño ranch that you can ask for a side of for dipping! The burger (I can't remember the name of it but it was listed last one the menu) was big and tasty! Friendly staff too made it a great eating experience"}
{"text":"Burger was over cooked and tasteless- and deconstructed into a mess (they did not care). Only positive was the fries were ok - not great, but ok. Anyplace else has got to be better."}
{"text":"Wasn't sure what to expect at first, there was no menu posted and it was a place I'd never heard of before.   I ordered the classic which had cheddar cheese, thousand island and pickled onions and cucumbers in it... It was fantastic! All of thier burgers come with two parties which I thought for sure would be too much but it wasn't at all.   My husband had the burger with poblano pepper and smoked mozzarella (?) and pick de gallo; only abs he really enjoyed his too!   Our service was excellent and to be a quick as expected for baseball stadium and a freshly made burger.   We will definitely go back next time we head to the stadium!"}
{"text":"Burgers are not great, tots are amazing.   Paradise Valley is not as good as fatburger. Wife tried to get some ingredients off of the burgers and was told that they could not. While waiting for burgers we witnessed a couple of clients rubbing off ingredients and throwing in trash. I had the green chili burger, wife had the original cheese. Not a fan.   im giving two stars on the sweet potato tater tots. pretty amazing if your into sweet potato. Might go back for more."}
{"text":"Small portion, but it was oh so good.  Ended up having the spicy burger (forget the name) and it was very flavorful.  Not always used to having such quality type food at a baseball game.  The pricing was fairly reasonable for what you received.  Definitely coming back to this location next time we go to the field"}
