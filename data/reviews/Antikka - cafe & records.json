{"text":"Nice, cozy spot on Queen to have coffee and maybe shop for records (they sell used LPs.) They have a small selection of lunch items & the pastries are delicious.  For a change of pace, try their Armenian coffee made the traditional way."}
{"text":"AMAZING! I came for Theo grand opening and was hooked! The coffee was delicious, treats were divine, bought 5 vinyl albums and the live band was on point! I'm hooked."}
{"text":"This is the only place I get coffee anymore. Hands-down my favourite cafe in the city.  

The coffee (ask about the Armenian coffee - they make it perfectly, and import the beans from an Armenian supplier in San Francisco) is consistently amazing, with a variety of delicious snacks (2 cheese flatbread is killer) and deserts (baklava is some of the best you can find in downtown TO) to indulge in. 

The ambiance is super friendly, with tasteful and mildly eccentric decor which helps set this place apart from some of the other cafes around it. The bathroom hosts one of the coolest mirrors in the city. Of course, other than the exceptionally good coffee, food, and design, the thing that makes this place stand out is the fact that they have a wicked vinyl collection to browse through as you wait for your order. 

The owners and staff are a pleasure to chat with, and happy to answer any questions or offer recommendations. Can't recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"The perfect addition to the neighbourhood. The coffee is consistently good and always a good record spinning, this place has the perfect vibe to sit back and relax, meet up with friends."}
{"text":"Rad coffee shop slash record store on Queen West. My husband and I stopped in out of curiosity (anything that has \"records\" in it he has to investigate) and ended up staying for a good half hour talking music with the staff and sipping on delicious coffee. 

I had the flat white and it was fantastic. My husband had just a standard drip coffee and he reported it as quite good as well. They have plenty of seating, from tables and chairs to more lounge type couches and such. Wifi was also really solid, which we appreciated being in from the States (crazy data charges, you know!). Staff was beyond friendly and knowledgeable and we had a great time chatting with them.

Great tunes played inside with plenty of fantastic vinyl to choose from to boot."}
{"text":"Antikka is a cafe and record shop on Queen West that recently opened. With a mix of rustic and indie vibes, Antikka let patrons enjoy a great cup of coffee and discover their next favourite vinyl. The name of the shop pays homage to the owner's grandmother, who often used the word to describe something outdated (similar to antique).

They specialize in making Armenian coffee, a process that uses sand to heat up the coffee to a boil and has to be done twice before serving. If you choose to get their Armenian coffee, they are served in specialized handmade coffee cups from a merchant straight from Armenia. If you prefer your coffee to be sweetened, do tell them in advance. It's recommended not to add any sugar or sweetener afterwards but during the brewing process instead. I also had the chance to drink their Chaiwala Chai Latte, which is not overly sweet or bland either. I did not have to add any sweetener since it had a mild sweet taste to it already.

Antikka will be bringing in live music performance starting January so you check their social media for more information. They will also be opening their patio during the summer time, which you can look forward to in the warmer months. If you are a student living close by, this cafe is perfect since there are plenty of outlets and WiFi for you to use. If you are normally on Queen West, drop by for a drink or come and sell your preloved vinyls."}
{"text":"I must have passed this spot so many times and I never realized that it was a coffee spot.  From the window, all you see is the old records and some rock paraphernalia.  Once you walk in, you see the espresso machine and the really nice cafe sitting area in the back.

I find the atmosphere quite different in a good way.  Rather than hipster cool or lap top hording... this place has a bit of an edge with a lot of the exposed walls painted dark and rock posters hanging about.  If a coffee shop and a man cave merged into one place, Antikka would be it.  I do have to admit though... if a man cave could have the array of baklava as this place did, I may claim the cave as mine.

The front of the store is mostly clean and well stocked boxes holding all the records.  They have some brand new ones and some gently/previously loved.  The prices seemed reasonable... $14 for some?  I'm not sure what the going rate is these days.  Either way, a lot of the records here looked like in great condition and all in sleeves.  Perhaps thats the norm but it seemed like they really cared about what they are selling.  

The back of the store is mostly the cafe with a real espresso machine and an entire display of baklava.  I should have bought some!  There are a few cute small tables along the wall with really nice cross sections of a tree trunk as a table.  I like when the beauty of nature shows up unexpectedly.

Service here is quick and friendly... Even though he was answering a few questions on other thing, he wasn't stopping making cups of cappuccino or flat whites.  I did notice they use Hale coffee beans ... this isn't a knock on Antikka but I've decided that Hale Coffee beans are the most sour and acidic of the Toronto roasters.  To me, it's not a good flavour... which is unfortunate cause I'd love to support any Toronto roaster.

Flat White - Even knowing it was Hale coffee beans used, I would say the skill of heating the milk, balance of espresso to milk, and even the pour... it's good.  It's possibly the best Hale Coffee drink I've had... even it was better than the one I had at Hale itself.  It still wasn't a great cup since the acidity was there but it wasn't as bad as other spots.  3.5/5

Overall, great interesting spot for you to check out if you love records and coffee.  I bet you can score a great conversation with the staff as they seem to really enjoy their craft and the music.  I may not come back for the coffee but I'd be willing to try the baklava!"}
{"text":"Don't write too many of these but I had a great experience here. I saw it a couple times on my walk to work and yesterday I finally visited. Authentic and laid back place on Queen West. Extensive vinyl selection, live shows all from local bands, and GREAT coffee."}
