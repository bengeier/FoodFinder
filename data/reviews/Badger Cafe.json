{"text":"I do my best to find hidden gems around town, but with little time and minimal resources or recommendations this is often difficult. There are a few such locations on my to-do list from an old top 10 burger list that I've had a hard time getting to, and it's time I get back to those priorities. I believe the last location that fit the bill was the Dispensary Lounge, and it turned out to be everything I hoped for. First on my list to accomplish was The Badger Cafe; the background sounded similar so I had high hopes. Did it come through?

Badger Cafe and its accompanying bar the Rum Runner have been around since 1979. It's a tiny place with only 4-5 booths, a handful of tables and a short diner style counter. The bar it's tied to looks like it has great ambiance if you're looking for an old school local Vegas institution. It's in an older part of town on East Tropicana; the strip malls feels this way, as does the staff and patrons. In many ways this was feeling similar to my experience at the Dispensary already. The menu has plenty of items, too many to mention. What is missing from the menu but quickly located at my table is $3.99 burger menu; a checklist of items to build your own 1/2 lb burger including several free items, several toppings for $.50, $.75 and $1.

I built my burger with lettuce, pickles, tomato, grilled mushrooms and double swiss. After a quick few minutes my burger arrived in a red plastic basket. Upon first bite the meat had great char flavor and was cooked perfectly. The mushrooms were flavorful although not too abundant. The pickles were good, the lettuce and tomato were fine. The sesame bun was soft, fresh and perfectly proportioned. The cheese was a bit too much; maybe it would be enough if it was a bit better as it was a little too salty and stood out, but hardly bad for the cost.

The fries were good; cooked well, flavorful and a bit different looking than normal. They had a familiar taste I couldn't quite identify at first but by the end I realized they tasted like tater tots. I don't always like tots, and for some reason they were great until I realized this. I still found myself eating more of them after I finished my burger. With all of my toppings and add-ons my meal came to $8.91, with my burger being $5.74 of that and worth every penny. Even at almost $9 for this meal, it's great. If you were ok with it and skipped some of the extras you could have an amazing $4 burger. It still doesn't quite beat Dispensary's burger but its damn close. This is an excellent example of a cheap, delicious pub burger, so if you're looking for some old school ambiance in a dive bar-type setting or even on the diner side, it's worth the trip."}
{"text":"NOTE (regarding previous posts):  I wanted to point out that the Badger Cafe is next to but not part of the Rum Rummer Lounge bar next door. It is self-contained now behind a nifty hermetically sealed glass wall (due to recent anti-smoking laws). Anyways, I just wanted to review the food/restaurant alone and separate it from the rest of the bar.....However, that being said, the option to order food and get it at the bar is totally up to you and your tolerance for tobacco smoke. Vice versa, getting beers from the bar is totally separate as well, but drinking has to be done in the bar AFAIK. 

FOOD: This ain't Kobe beef, but save yourself the trouble of high LV Strip prices and come here for a solid 1/2 pound burger. I've eaten here many a times back in the day when I lived in Las Vegas (05' - 09') and when I used to drive long distances to visit Las Vegas (02' - 04'). This place deserves a shrine. I always recommend this place to friends, but it's not for the faint of heart. If you abhor grease, battered fries, chili-cheese fries, and all things from the griddle....look elsewhere. Otherwise, if you call yourself a \"grease aficionado\", welcome to nirvana. Cheap prices and a 24 hour availability makes this place dangerous for the waistline. Get a few beers next door and you'll praise the sedentary lifestyle soon enough. I've never had their wings, but have heard decent things and they're cheap. I always go for the build your own burgers starting for under $3 - add some Ortega green chiles, a slice of cheese and take all the fixin's (ask for a pencil and request everything on those 4x11 order sheets) and then enjoy the cheap bill b/c it never costs you more than $5 even if you get the fries for 75 cents. Seriously, take a trip off the Strip (if you're a visitor) and enjoy a part of LV flavor. If you have time to spare, knock off an hour or two and see some rhinestone glitz at the Liberace Museum as well.

ATMOSPHERE: It's in a strip mall with a dance studio, a Korean resto and grocery mart - but what Las Vegas place isn't in a strip mall? Lot's of blue hairs, Packers/UW fans, pool tables, shuffle board and tons of characters at all times of the day. As mentioned above....Look for the \"Rum Runner Lounge\" to get that review and ask for Birdie when you're there - she's the bomb. Again...if you hate smoking, the anti-smoking laws (as mentioned above) won't keep you separated from your greasy spoon cravings - just eat at the cafe. 

HINTS: If you order at the bar, be sure to tell the bartender so he/she can flag down one of the BC waitstaff. Otherwise, order at the cash register next door and bring the food in. I find that if you play on the VP machines, you'll usually get better service right away. Another added advantage is \"comp drinks\" - if you put a $20 in the VP machine and play at max bet ($1.25), the drinks are \"free\" while you can enjoy your chow with those nifty bar wood block tables. (Food isn't free - so just pay your BC waitstaff separately)."}
{"text":"Alright. The cook was very nice and really went the distance in compartmentalizing the entree, sauce, gravy, and salads for the chicken fried steak that I ordered. So for that, awesome job!

However, the downside is that the \"chicken\" really wasn't chicken at all. It wasn't \"whole\" chicken like we're used to seeing, but was more like chicken that has been made from chicken paste (similar to burger patties made from beef paste). I took 2 bites and just couldn't stomach the rest. So the quality of the \"chicken\" was just complete crap and rest of the food were just sub-par and for that 2 stars. Sorry"}
{"text":"Love the BURGERS here. Create your own is the best part. The fries are delicious, light breaded and crispy. You order burger on a paper and you pencil in your ingredients. I found an article in Las Vegas Weekly and figured we try it. We ended up finding a burger joint. The reason I gave 4 out of 5 because the waiter was super busy busing, drinks, orders, checkout and cleaning. So the wait was a bit long but understandable.Thats pretty much it. Definitely going back and calling it 'Our Burger Joint'. One more thing, they are attached with RumRunnnerEnjoy!"}
{"text":"The food and service here is excellent. Tiara was very attentive, patient and has a friendly smile. We would definitely recommend this place. Good price and good portions on the food too!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here one day because of reviews based on here and needless to say I wasn't too impressed. I got a weird vibe because drunk people kept coming over from the Rum Runner or whatever it's called to order food. The waitress was acting like she was SUPER busy when there was only one table of a family there eating. She doesn't even cook the food for goodness sakes. But there isn't a sign saying to seat yourself and we stood by the door way for about 5 minutes before we finally sat ourselves down because she clearly wasn't going to tell us to just find a place. Then it took her about 15 minutes to pick up our cards for our orders and finally get us drinks. She said she was \"so busy\" when it was dead in there and all she has to do is take the food to the bar. IDK I just don't look at the place being busy as a good excuse for no courtesy. The food was pretty good but don't expect good service."}
{"text":"They have good food but probably not the most healthiest. Their half pound burger special is good but there is nothing special about the price. After you add the extras and peanilized if you do not buy a drink, it can be close to 10 dollars before tip. A lot better burgers in town when your spending 10 dollars. Their wings are very good. Fries are good too.  Just remember, it's good food but not very healthy. The breakfast is decent but they cheap out on the hasbrowns."}
{"text":"I went to this place for the first time thanks to have good reviews on Yelp. This place is great.The service is personal and friendly. I felt tha I wanted to try everything on the menu. Good fried goodies available, from shrimp to wings and many available dipping sauces.Cooked to order burgers with a customizable list of toppings makes this a great deal. Batter dipped fries are also very good."}
{"text":"We usually order take out from here and for the most part we just get wings! The reason for the 3 stars is because its not consistent! Sometimes they are the BEST wings ever like big with lots of sauce and sometimes they are the Worst like super small with hardly any meat and dry! I wish they were consistent we would order more often!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Anytime I want inexpensive diner food I go to badger! My favorites: Medium wings, medium-rare burgers, and the chili cheese fries. The wings are super fat and juicy every time I get them. The medium wings are the best and I've had the blackened wings and they were okay, but not really my thing. It is RIDICULOUS that you can get a burger so cheap and that the cooks will make it medium rare. It is so hard to find a good medium rare burger joint! I have to stop myself from getting a tasty burger every time I go there. The chili is to die for and it is even better on fries topped with cheese! I've also had the cheese curds which were good and the pot roast was good. The pot roast had great texture, but needed to be seasoned a bit more. I look forward to trying more meals here!"}
{"text":"The Badger Cafe is a quick place to go to near UNLV's campus. The staff is friendly and attentive. The prices are low, but the food quality is good. I plan to come here from time to time when you are looking for a cheap bite to eat. It's connected to the Rum Runner, so the bar is only a few feet away."}
{"text":"I've never been disappointed by badger cafe! Good food for really good prices. The servers are always friendly. The burgers are straight forward and perfectly made. The wings are messy in a good way. The breakfast is exactly what you want after a night of debauchery. Speaking of debauchery, its attached to a bar!"}
{"text":"I came here because there was a lot of people who recommended it to me, so I decided why not give it a shot. Went there on Saturday the 20th and was hoping to have a great breakfast, but the only way I can describe it is ehhh. Slightly better then Denny's with a little better service, but definitely not worth making it a point to go there. More of a \"what can we get that's 24hrs , not badly priced but excluding Denny's?\" Type of place."}
{"text":"Really disappointed!!  Read reviews & thought this would be a good place.  My brother & sister-in-law had 3 hour layover at airport & thought this would be great place to grab a bite & visit.  Items online were not available as stated. Waitress was friendly but when I asked about online items she said website hadn't been updated in years. Omelet had slice of processed cheese slapped on top (not even melted). All 4 dishes brought out separately with at least 5 minutes between each one, so we each ate our meal one at a time .  Steak was tough eggs overcooked, potatoes cold & toast came after meal half eaten..  I can't understand all the positive reviews!!  Huevos rancheros were horrible - cold beans dry tortillas!!"}
{"text":"I used to live down the street from this bar and never knew that it was there it's a great friendly environment with good drink specials machines and lots of things to do when your drinking attach there is a restaurant that has some  phenomenal food 

they have a really great 399 build your own which is the most juiciest cooked to order burger I've ever had a bar it has all different kinds of toppings you can choose fries sauces and any kind of trimmings you can think of

their chicken wings have so many different flavors they have all the way from hot to plane to honey barbecue to spicy barbecue with ranch and bleu cheese they're cooked fresh that big plump and juicy

the even have some great specials on the menu like a chicken fried steak sandwich with country gravy for 599 which is one of my favorite 

to go to anytime of the day with any kind of friends"}
{"text":"So my friends Ivan and Martin kept hyping up this place called rum runner aka badger cafe. It was okay til I receive my burger all soggy with black wet stuff on the side of my buns. I was disturbed... It was by far unappealing. I ate like 1/3 of the burger...never again"}
{"text":"I still go here regularly. This is the best \"home cooking\" comfort food I've found in the Valley. 

I'm told there is a new Manager. I don't know everything is still the best!! I'm also told that the Daily Specials will change a bit very soon for the summer. I don't care, it is all good.

BTW: Michele had a beautiful baby boy. Mom and Baby are doing fine.

I can only wonder what they will come up with for the Summer.
 
Badger Cafe is also known for their very juicy 1/2 lb. Burgers, Wings, and Buffalo Shrimp.

They put out a great Bratwurst on a roll with saute onions and Kraut.

If you want real \"Down to Earth\" good food. Don't miss this place."}
{"text":"So I was really excited to find a place on the East side w/ decent wings (based on yelp reviews)... but they could have been so much more! I got the 24 piece wings w/ 'hot' sauce, fries, and an extra side of sauce. First, the prices seriously can't be beat. The fries were an additioanl 75 cents... seriously. 24 wings for 15 or so. Fries were excellent by the way. 

So I got home w/ anticipation... The wings were good, not great, not enough sauce. Lucky me, I got extra sauce on the side! But oh NO! They gave me bbq sauce, not hot sauce... Therefore, you see the reason for my initial statement. The texture and flavor was solid, just not enough sauce. I'm sure I'll check this place out again and probably update my review so as to help everyone else in my situation of \"Wingless on the East Side\". There must be others out there that feel my pain!"}
{"text":"Hot chicken wings were very buttery. Reminded me of Hooters wings. Waitress was awesome and Ill try more things on the menu! Worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Fantastic build-your-own burgers and very friendly service! Tasty coleslaw - not too much mayo, not too much vinegar, but lots of flavor. Good beer-battered fries, too. If we were local, this would be our go-to burger place!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite spot for breakfast!

The food was beyond expectations. Their bacon is crispy and tasty, it is rare to find a breakfast place that makes bacon like this anymore. Their hash browns are by far the best hash browns I've ever had, I highly recommend them. The toast melts in your mouth and is made perfectly. Don't even get me started with their steak, very good quality meat that isn't tough to eat.

I think that they can improve on their eggs. Got soft scrambled eggs and over hard eggs and neither came out exactly how I wanted it.

I am really impressed with the man who took our order, made the food, clean the tables, and took our payment so quickly and all by himself!

My least favorite thing about this place is that it's in a sketchy location and it smells like smoke from the bar next to it."}
{"text":"Best burger is Vegas! The fries are great as well. Plus it's a fantastic deal, 3.99!

Having said that, my mom got the breakfast and she said it wasn't anything out of the ordinary but it was good solid food. I come from a small town and I enjoyed the cozy atmosphere. The staff were really nice and it seems like most of the customers are regulars. I think it's Wisconsin type food because they have fried cheese curds. Delish!

My only complaint was that the iced tea was ghastly. It was that syrup stuff instead of brewed. You pretty much have to get a drink to get the deal, so I recommend coke or lemonade."}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch on Sunday, May 27th. This was by far the best burger I've eaten in a LOOOOONG time!  It's a little bit of a dive, but that just adds to its charm. Prices were VERY reasonable and portions were large. If I lived here, I'd be gaining a lot of weight, cause I'd be eating here all the time!"}
{"text":"After a pathetic attempt to play pool at the neighboring Gorilla Cafe, several of us meandered over to Badger Cafe for some grub.

BC is attached to the RumRunner Bar.  The first thing i notice when walking into BC is that thick grease SMELL.  Man, they are seriously competing with Geri's Philly Cheesesteak for not only the strongest grease smell but the \" take me back to the 60's/70's coffee shop motiff.  Personally, I dig it !!

But hey, it don't mean a thang if the food don't swing.  Again, for me, the food works but let's get real, the place is a hole in the wall grease pit so go in knowing and understanding that.

I went with the build your own burger - added bacon, egg, swiss cheese and grilled onion.  Also went with the homemade potato chips.  The server suggested i go with her \" off the menu\" option of vinegar and garlic salt added to the chips, \" Sure!\"

The burger was perfectly cooked.  As what has become the norm lately, more salt needed on the burger ( is it me ??) great bacon and the egg hit the spot.  Minor ding - the swiss cheese slice was paltry and did little for the overall burger.  

As far as the chips - really pleased to see they are krinkle/dip chip style - nice !  As to the garlic salt and vinegar - sorry, i wasn't feeling it - i'll stick to the garlic salt next time.

The group also ordered chicken wings ( didn't try ) and cheese curds - did try and loved them !   

Saddened i couldn't get a Wisconsin Beer to go with the grub ( asked about Point Beer and Leinenkugel but i got a blank stare - settled for a blue moon ) 

I will return

{"text":"This is a 5 star dive that's worth the drive. Be forewarned, it's not fancy.  But who cares?  If you're here it's probably 2am and you either have been, or will be, making poor decisions. But in the meantime, enjoy some of the best middle of the night food you'll find in Vegas. 24 hours for your convenience. 

This is the place where I have had some of my best times with my friends. We spent NYE13 here and watched the fireworks from the parking lot. 

I've eaten so much drunk food here. Their build your own burger is so great.  I actually CRAVE their wings. 

We've never had a safety concern here, or food poisoning. We've never had an issue with our bill or charging our card. 

If I had a last meal request before I die, it would be the teriyaki wings and cheese curds."}
{"text":"Amazing place and great service. Not expensive at all. Near to the strip and has great menu. Eat like a long here and proceed to visit the rest of Nevada.  
The lady here is awesome with a nice smile and welcoming.  They even have wings for breakfast which I am lte is awesome again. You can order before hand too. Yelp shows closed in the morning but this place is open 24*7 just like the city. So come here and enjoy it."}
{"text":"Service was good, waitress was working really hard and was very nice. However, the cafe is rather dingy and tacky. Everything I touched was sticky or slimy. Food was pretty boring. I shared a grilled chicken sandwich and a Cobb salad with someone. The chicken sandwich was fine, but ver plain. The Cobb salad was a head of iceberg lettuce, a sad looking tomato, and some walnuts. It also smelled kind of bad in the restaurant."}
{"text":"So 5star yes but hear me out... 
This is as good as it gets for a small greasy spoon dive cafe.

First off coffee was good and hot...( Coffee mate brand creamer helped)

Cheap...diced ham and egg scramble wasnt a large portion but it wasnt too filling( so what if i didnt need to unbutton my pants afterward.)

Hash browns were nice n crispy..(.the way they should be.)

Service was decent no complaints.

Open 24 7 is how is should be...we are in Vegas after all

We'll be back"}
{"text":"If you want a simple, fulfilling meal for a more than decent price, this is the place to go. I normally visit this place for a good hangover meal with the boyfriend. Have to be honest though, there's nothing about the food that makes your taste buds go wild. 
Hahaha... This place is also attached to the Rumrunner Bar, so I'll also include this place as a side note. 
The servers, cooks and bartenders are always nice at these places. Quite personable characters. 
The simplicity and customer service is what makes it deserving of 4 stars."}
{"text":"I sat down and waited a long time :/ the prices for the burgers seem to go up every 2 months . Less than a year ago the burgers started at 399 now they start at 539 not having this place anymore and it sucks because it's so close to my work :(  I sat down in front by ash register and the dark skinned lady ignored me atleast 15 min without saying anything just walking past me . Not a good luck guys !"}
{"text":"Came here after work one night (5 in the morning) for their $3.99 1/2 pounder burger. The burger here is made to order and you can customize any ways you want it. The staff here was nice and the burger was delicious. This place is good for people like me who work late and people who get hungry after partying all night."}
{"text":"Really loved this place! I walked in through the rum runner and was like NOOOOO ANOTHER VEGAS TRAP but then I saw the door for the Badger Cafe and I was pleasently surprised. 

No smoke smell and it felt like a diner. 

I ordered the skillet which was like 5.99 or something ridiculously cheap, had 2-3 eggs, sausage, bacon and maybe another meat, then hasbrowns and it came in an OG skillet. 

Loved it! My girlfriend got a burger of some kind and she really loved it also the fries here are really good!

I mean really good! 

Overall I really liked the Badger Cafe, really good tasting food at really cheap prices."}
{"text":"In case it's your first time here, the initial space you walk into is for food, next is the bar. 
Went for steak & eggs and the food itself was good, but didn't have a late night special price unfortunately. The food had its inconsistencies, ordered a total of 3 steggs all medium rare, but one came out extremely rare. 

The server was pretty rude, but I guess she didn't questions in general. 
Overall, the locational isnt really my side of town so I doubt I'll be back again.."}
{"text":"Go here. Get cheap awesome breakfast and get day drunk next door. It's like a real diner. Completely separate from Rum Runner bar so no smoke if that's your thing.

Any second I was waiting for Alice to pop her head out an yell \"Kiss my grits y'all!\""}
{"text":"Manager got back to me 10 days after my initial review, just a few minutes ago. Absolutely rude and said he's never had a complaint against the particular waitress in 8 years (hard to believe, I've polled other friends who've eaten there and don't care for her either...)

Completely missed the point when I explained that it was extremely unprofessional for her to confront / harrass us WHILE WE'RE EATING and tell us how much we're lying; how it's not about the ONE EXTRA DOLLAR WE WOULD HAVE GLADLY PAID, but the way she did her job. Even admitted that HE told HER not to serve us until he talked with my boyfriend and I first (So I guess it's perfectly okay to have the disabled cook serve us when it's obvious his leg hurts when he walks...REAL nice of you!) Doesn't like the fact we gave our opinions on the service, thought it was rude of US. Excuse me for warning others about how badly we were served on multiple occassions. (Just FYI - Gotten plenty of PMs thanking me for the review! Keep it up!)

The food was pretty good but I will never ever return. According to them, I'm sure they won't miss my boyfriend and I and are probably glad to be rid of us. Fine with me. I'll stick to the friendlier hole-in-the-wall establishments I frequent.

Seriously, what happened to basic human decency in this world? I didn't want any free food, I didn't want ANYTHING out of this except for the business to understand that what she did was absolutely uncalled for and very unprofessional. I would have been happy to just hear one sentence --- \"I'm sorry this happened and we will discuss this with the waitress\" When I worked in the service industry, this was how things were usually handled.  \"Well sorry you don't like the way we run things,\" is what was said instead...and no. No I sure don't like the way this place is running things...and if they continue to treat others this way, we aren't going to be the only ones.

I bid adieu to all the NICE people there (Kristi, Short-Haired Waitress I can't remember's name, and all the cooks!)...I will miss you all terribly."}
{"text":"This is by far the best value and great eats for burgers and wings in Las Vegas.  It's a very small place on Tropicana and Spencer in the east side.  How I wish they were around when I was a student at UNLV.  My buddy found this diamond in the rough and has great tasty burgers.  You order from a checklist menu.  It's very delicious.  I am definitely going to return."}
{"text":"The actual sit-down restaurant is every bit as divey as the Rum Runner bar it's attached to- but in the best old-school way. Service is more on par with a diner, with friendly older ladies who exceed your expectations and call you variations of \"honey\" and \"sweetie\" every time they come by to check on you.

Food is delicious and affordable:
$4 app of beer-battered brats with spicy mustard is A+
Wings can be ordered in increments of 6, but only one sauce for 6 and 12 piece orders- if you want multiple flavors, just order multiple 6-pieces. Both ranch and bleu cheese dressing available, sauce variety has about ten types from mild to hot, extra spicy, lime, garlic, and blackened- their specialty.
The burgers though, are probably a highlight: just under $6 to build your own with the basics, adding on a few charges for add-ons like guac, grilled mushrooms, and jalapenos. Grilled and fresh onions are both free, found it odd that tomatoes were a fifty-cent charge.

Good food, good service. They could have a stand-alone place with this kind of quality, but seem to have a good setup with the RumRunner!"}
{"text":"Your everyday vintage and classic style cafe+ bar. The food is delicious!

Especially the burgers. You order the burgers by filling out a sheet that lists all the details you want for you for your burger. Cooked fresh for your taste buds. And these burgers are grilled, not fried or microwaved(fast food). 

Don't forget the fries either for only a dollar more. And these are no overcooked fries. They're like curly fries except not curly. But cooked deliciously. Might I mention though that the burger starts at $3.99 which is absolutely absurd when you consider the quality of the food. 

They also require you to purchase a drink with burger orders which are about $1 if not, slightly more. But you can't complain about the value of this deal w hen you compare it to other diners such as denny's and etc. 

I also ordered 6 wings which were tasty but pricy at 4.49 for 6. 

The service was great too! Not a lot of people so our server was very consistent in providing us our dinner. I will DEFINITELY be coming back for more."}
{"text":"Reeeeeeeaaaaaaallllly slow service. I realize the bar next door is busy with pool players ordering food but one burger, that's all I want, just one burger, and she wouldn't give it to me......half an hour, dayum. Basic diner fare. Decent fries."}
{"text":"My best friend moved across the street from this place so we decided to go and explore the area. Came across the Badger Cafe and decided to check it out. As soon as we walked in, a guy waiting for his order probably instantly knew we had never been there before. He then told us \"best burgers in Vegas. Been coming here for years\". So we sat down because it's self seating. The waitress we had was super sweet and friendly. I did order soft shell tacos but got the hard shell. The waitress apologized and offered to fix it real quick but it wasn't a big deal for me.

The taco was just like any other tacos. Nothing special. My friend got a burger and he said it was alright like any other burger.

I'll probably be coming back for the customer service more than the food when I want something in the area."}
{"text":"For the type of place it is, its open 24/7, waiter was attentive, i think they serve breakfast 24/7,

I ordered the Spicy Pastrami on wheat bread, had jalapenos and a nice kick to it, with fries bill came up to 7.02.

Cute little place although intimidating to walk inside at first."}
{"text":"If I can find somebody to join me, I need to try the Deep Fried Cheese Curds. This is a Wisconsin bar and besides for a brat I saw on menu, this appears to be the only true Wisconsin offering. I have had them before up there and they are crazy good and chewy, totally unlike mozzarella sticks, becuase they just use the curds. At $4.99, I still wasn't willing to get a full order solo because I would have eaten them all. 
Ok, now onto what I actually did eat. Had a 1/2 order of Biscuits/Gravy for $1.50, basically 1.5 biscuits in a gravy. These were good for the price. Then I tried the burger deal and my toppings were free (grilled onions, raw onions, 1000 island and pickles) and for $2 more, I added a side of blue cheese crumbles and fries. The fries were thin and beer battered, so that gave them a different and excellent taste and the burger ($4.99) was cooked to my liking and quite thick for a 1/2 pounder. Although, it says fresh meat, I have muy doubts. My definition of fresh is fresh ground beef every day, but not sure what everybody else defines it as. Whatever it was, it was in the middle of the pack for a burger, great value, but probably not bnetter than GRIND up the street.
The four stars are for those Curds which I must try soon. Oh, yeah nice waitress too, older lady and a huge TV in dining area makes for good sports watching."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of burgers, but i like Badger a LOT - and that's definitely saying something for their food. 

Their service could use a little work sometimes, but I've never been disappointed in their food or service enough to ever think about never coming back. 

Every now and then, but very rarely, some items would be left off the burger, like my grilled mushrooms, but it was very easily fixed. There are also rare occasions when we have to wait a little longer than we'd like for refills on our drinks, but again nothing that would keep us away. 

As a non-smoker, I enjoy that they have full separation, yet easy access to the bar portion.

I like the burgers as they are made to order with fresh ingredients - and exactly how you want them. You simply use the provided pencils and fill out your yellow order card, and voila! 

I've tried a couple of the menu items, and I wasn't very impressed at all - I just didn't feel like a burger. Now, I know better, and burgers it is every time!"}
{"text":"Adjacent to the Rum Runner. Waitresses actually come into the bar to take orders. Service is genuinely friendly and helpful. The wings appear to be off a pre-historic bird, which is massive for non-history buffs. Large list of flavor options. 

I want to come back."}
{"text":"Nothing has actually changed from the restaurant since our first visit.  In fact, it's still that same old diner adjacent to Rum Runner that serves one of the best burgers in Las Vegas.  So why must I write an update and even take down a star from my initial review?!  I suppose my last experience was rather appalling.  

After going to the bar numerous times for years, it was a first that a menu was brought to my attention.  Having always ordered the burger with desired fixins and a side of hot wings, I wanted to venture out and go for something else.  After reading through an extensive array of items I didn't know the restaurant has offered in the past, I decided to go for the roast beef.  For $7.99, the meal comes with salad or soup, vegetable of the day and a choice of potato.  To my surprise, the dish was not as I expected it to be.  The meat itself was comparable to prepackaged deli one can get at grocery stores.  Only if the menu mentioned that part, I could have saved money or ordered something else as I didn't even eat more than a bite from it.

Overall, Badger Cafe is still my go-to late night burger joint.  Perhaps, don't expect highly of their other items on the menu if you do end up going that route.  One thing's certain, I'll just stick to what I know best and order that next time."}
{"text":"Very..Bad..Service..

My family attempted to eat at this establishment after looking at the reviews on Yelp.  We came today, Monday, December 21st, at about 0945. We came in the door and noticed that we were the only customers.  

The waitress saw us, and didn't acknowledge us, and went in the kitchen area. My wife went to the counter and called for the waitress in order to get a highchair,   with a  repeated \"Hello\" and \"Excuse me.\" And mind you, we were the only ones there.

After no success,  I then walked up and almost yelled for the waitress.  By this time,  I figured I didn't want the cook to spit in our food, so we started to walk out.

Lo and behold,  the waitress finally came out and said, \"Yes?\"

Only if my son wasn't with us.....i would've given her more than 2 cents! 

Needless to say,  I was very disappointed. 

Will we be back the next time we're in the LV area, but of course! But only when bulls start to give milk!"}
{"text":"Gotta give it to them.  The food was great and inexpensive. I went in there with a party of 7 and not person had anything negative to say about the food or restaurant."}
{"text":"Great food at Great Prices, Open 24 hours. Small Place. Counter Service and a handful of Tables. Great Wings and a 1/2 lb burger. Pretty extensive menu and excellent service."}
{"text":"I love diners and old school divey coffee shops so I HAD to try the Badger, which is across the street from where I work.  I've met a number of friends here for lunch over the past year and we always enjoy it.  The service is always great - super friendly and makes you feel like you're a regular even if you're not (yet).  

The house salad with raspberry vinaigrette is great - the vinaigrette a little sweeter than most.  The grilled cheese on wheat are thin, but ooey-gooey.  I just had their Cream of Broccoli soup last week - and that was probably my favorite thing I've tried to date. Oh and lunch for two people with sodas was $8.61 - that's right - eight dollars and sixty-one cents.  Ridiculously inexpensive.

The classic diner painted windows and orange formica tables just scream PHOTOSHOOT to me - someday maybe I'll remember to bring a camera."}
{"text":"Had a couple of burgers here today they were excellent.Server seemed like she was high on something.The cook was cool ,if it weren't for him we would have left.When I  asked for the check she just grabbed the money off the table before I even had a chance to look at it.Also had breakfast a couple of times,had a tall black girl server who could care less about anything.They need to get someone else to do the hiring."}
{"text":"The two main staples at Badger are the Burgers and Wings. You order from a little checklist menu (ala sushi style). The burgers are big and cheap. The wings are tasty and cheap. It's gotta be one of the best values in town. It's always good. The portions are big. And did I mention it's cheap?"}
{"text":"Tried the Badger Cafe this morning for breakfast and we are sure to go back! Food was great, prices were very reasonable, and service was A+"}
{"text":"Just had the best breakfast we've had in a long time! Eggs were perfectly cooked, high quality sausage and great coffee. The service was really friendly and accommodating, and the atmosphere was cozy. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This will forever be my favorite place to eat in vegas. Not only do they serve the best wings/burgers in town 24/7 but they also have a great menu with lots of delicious breakfast items as well as lunch! the servers here are always super friendly. One can never go wrong with what they get. I highly recommend this place. Trust me after your first bite you'll forget you're at a bar. They're food is amazing!!"}
{"text":"Usually I love this place the burgers are the best and the chicken fried steak sandwich is amazing! Tonight I tried the new york steak and it was not as great as i hoped it to be. The string beans were mushy and the mashed potatoes hmmm lets say lacking. However i will still come back for burgers i just know to never order the steak again:("}
{"text":"Greatest greasy spoon style burgers ever. Fresh fast delicious. Service is great too. Same people for years."}
{"text":"The food was great!  The restaurant is not.  The service was so slow it was almost comical. At one point, the waitress acknowledged that we had nothing to drink but it was still another five minutes before someone actually brought us a refill. While there, I saw a guy standing and waiting to pay for a full five minutes or more, hoping to avoid that, I made sure to get up when she was paying attention, but she sat down with another table and spoke to them about the menu for quite a while.  Their service was probably awesome.  

The restaurant itself is non-smoking, but is connected to a bar that allows smoking, so it's still pretty smokey.

Overall, I would definitely eat the food again, I would probably just order it to go."}
{"text":"This place is great! I never get dissapointed when I eat here. This is definatly not a place if you are on a diet though because the burgers and fries are really greasy but that's what makes em taste so great lol.

At first I was skeptical about the food because I saw it was 3.75 for a half pound Burger? But come to find out its Angus so WIN! Order everything on the checklist that's free plus add cheese and fries for 50 cents and 75 cents and you are good to go. The batter on the fries make them the best fries I have ever tried hands down. If you are in the mood for wings they have cheap decent wings here I'm not a big fan but apparently lots of people order them.

Red Robin used to be my favorite fast food Burger joint until I came here. Its well worth your money here. The best part is that they are 24 hours with a full menu of other diner foods."}
{"text":"After going to 2 other restaurants (they were closed), we stumbled upon this place because it was still open at 1am. We walked into the Rum Runner, and the man at the bar directed us to the Badger Cafe. Upon walking into the cafe, we almost slipped because the floor seemed to be oily. Not in just one area, but it seemed the entire floor was oily. The seats were also noticeably dirty, but we just decided to stay and try the food.

I had the tuna melt and my friend customized a burger. The tuna melt was okay. My friend said her burger was good, but when she got the check, it came out more than what she expected. The menu advertised that the burger was about $6 and gave a checklist of any additions you wanted, with no prices next to it- so it was very misleading. On a brighter note, the breaded fries were BOMB.COM and our server was super sweet, but I don't think I'd do a second take."}
{"text":"I give to give this cafe five stars for their superb customer service.  My waitress was fantastic, she played waitress, cashier and busser and did a fantastic job.  My hat is off to her!  The restaurant is nothing fancy, a counter and maybe five or six tables.  I felt like I was at Mel's Diner on the tv show Alice!  I ordered the 6 piece chicken wings medium and a small side salad.  I was there during lunch hour, and the salad was brought to me immediately.   The wings came out right when I finished the salad, and very tasty.  They had no batter or extra sauce, but they were soo good!  I will go back!"}
{"text":"Sad to say it but the prices have gone up. And I'm ok with that . BUT , the portions are smaller and the new burger patties are not as good as the previously used Angus beef they used to serve . The new burgers taste like frozen pre made burger patties . And they are smaller thinner too. Tiny amount of fries , not like they used to be . Great tasting fries are still the same , for now. Big Mike the chef and the servers are awesome, so my complaint isn't with them . This change is on the owners . Pay more for less and get lower quality ? Not a good way to treat the regulars . And I'm not the only customer in that strip mall that feels this way . Several others have noticed the decline of the Badger Cafe .  Sad, because they were the best place in town to grab a burger . All the portions no matter what you order look smaller . And NO they didn't just buy bigger plates ."}
{"text":"Awesome greazy spoon diner with \"Bucky the Badger\" as its mascot.  It's obvious a fellow cheesehead is the President and CEO of this operation.  I have been here several times next door at the adjoining Rum Runner for Packer games but I needed a little breakfast pick me up to get my day started so I gave this place a try. I am glad I did.  The prices were fair and they claim to have \"The Best Burger\" around.  

I went with \"The Skillet\" with wheat toast and coffee.  Scrambled eggs mixed with ham, bacon, sausage, cheese, green peppers, onions and tomatoes on a bed of hash browns.  AWESOME!  After a lost ticket the food came out quickly and sizzling hot on a plank and cast iron skillet.  Great start to any day for under $7.00 as well as a hearty portion. Coffee was good and I received a few warm ups while dining in.  

I am going to have to come back soon to try that burger but they also have wings that looked delicious also.  Great for any Packer game viewing party."}
{"text":"It is the best local bar/restaurant.  The burgers are great, for the same price as McDonald's, Jack in the Box, Burger King, it is far superior and far fresher.  The wings are tasty and they have so many flavors it rivals Bdubs.  My favorite things though are the cheese curds, those can be a meal on their own.  They are cheesy crispy delicious morsels.  I know I know, what's the difference between cheese curds and mozzarella sticks?  The taste, the cheese in the cheese curds are a sharper tasting cheese.  I can't forget the $3 dollar large glass of PBR, I think it's a 36 oz., it's one of those really large beer mugs.  So to recap for $10 I can have a burger, a shot, and a beer.  Makes this gal very happy!  

The servers and bartenders are super friendly, makes you feel like a friend and feel like you're in the midwest.  The service in the kitchen can kinda be inconsistent depending on how busy they are, but even when my food comes out a little different it still tastes sooo good, so I don't even mind.

Great place to sit chill watch sports and meet nice people."}
{"text":"Best burger for the price. Cheese curds are great. Cozy little spot that I go whenever I need a quick bite. Even if you're a Vikings fan haha."}
{"text":"This place is kind of hidden in a plaza full of other cafes. As part of the Rum Runner Lounge, it is a 24 hour sit down style restaurant. From all of my visits so far there are more pros then cons.

Pros
Since its 24 hours you can come here any time. The lounge itself is sealed off from the cafe because they put a door to the entrance instead of being an open space. Menus are on all the tables so when you sit at whatever table is available you can already start looking at your options and everything is on the menu is available at any time. Every table has all the condiments you will ever need for any of your entrees. 

Cons
LIke I mentioned above, since its 24 hours, if you come between the hours of 12 am and 5 am, you just might run into some colorful characters. The bathrooms are located in the casino so if you have kids, they need to be escorted at all times.

As for the food, I have discovered so far that most everything I have tried is good. The things that you cant go wrong with are the burgers, hot wings, chili cheese fries, onion rings, and any breakfast item. 

For the burgers which are half pound not frozen angus beef patties, (starting at $4.99) you have a checklist of what you want on there so you can mark off what you want with the pencils provided. Items like pickles, lettuce, mayo, and onions are free while some others like tomatoes, cheese, bacon, etc are extra. Same goes for the hot wings. You select your quantity and what flavor.

The one downer for food I got one time was the new york steak. It was bland. I had to douse it with a combination of A1 and Heinz 57 sauce just to give it some kind of flavor.

Service for the most part was stellar. Understandably if the place is busy then service will be slow sometimes especially when patrons from the lounge order things as well. Yes, you can hang out in the lounge and order food to be brought out to you. 

So overall, Badger Cafe is a nice spot to hit up if you are in the area no matter what time it is for good grub at decent prices.

{"text":"Came here after easing great review of their burger special. Burger was great and filling. Such a great little hole in the wall."}
{"text":"Great 1/2 pound burger for 5.50. And the wings omg the wings. But best of all the homemade potato chips! Great deal."}
{"text":"Wings are awesome!
Hard to find good wings in this town for some reason.
The hot wings are just right here...nice n hot without being too hot where you can barely eat them like some places.
Cooked perfectly too....crisp!
This is the spot for wings, no doubt."}
{"text":"Wow, just... Wow.

My Firs- SECOND- and only- SECOND complaint! (Still the same complaint, really.)

So, I went back today hoping to redeem my views. They were simply reinforced. Even though Yelp is most definitely a place for opinions I will try my best to be as factual as possible. I hate for one bad experience or one bad employee to ruin an entire restaurant for me but that's the way it's looking. Heck, that's the entire reason I went back tonight! \"Don't let one bad apple spoil the bunch.\" to be a good sport, heck I even tipped my normal rate again tonight because I am still trying to see the positives! Well, I'll start with that:

THE GOOD: As usual the food was outstanding. We were not only served by \"Katie\" (who I will get to in a second), but also by a gentleman in the back who quite possibly the only man to receive a hypothermia injury in Las Vegas. He was polite, friendly, and still hobbled over providing us with great service in spite of his leg injuries. The place was a little busier on the bar side of things tonight.

THE BAD: Katie, oh lord Katie. 

My girlfriend and I came back, hoping to amend things. For some perspective we have both worked in the service industry before, mostly retail, so we try to keep that in mind. Seriously, I am at a loss for words for your -tact-.  

Yes, management DID try to get in touch with me since my last visit and review. However, they never left a message, leaving me to believe they were telemarketers. I also work at a hospital so once I realized who was calling me I tried to call back ASAP. I do not have the luxury of being able to answer my phone immediately at work. So, I'd end up speaking to someone else who didn't know the situation or why they were being called. Okay.

Katie came over, reminding us that management tried to call. We gave the above explanation and this time gave them my girlfriend's number for contact (she CAN be bothered to answer the phone more than I, and honestly, I'm done). We ordered and started to eat, served by the gentleman I mentioned above. It was busy in the bar area, so I won't jump to conclusions and say she was avoiding us.  

She asked if we had \"come again for another round to complain.\" I replied that, \"no, this was our first time coming in since you last saw us. It must have been someone else.\" To her credit, she did let slip one \"I'm sorry\" around this point.

But then, and I can't believe this, Katie actually got out her tablet, and brought up my first review on Yelp! She said, and yes, this time I am quoting, \"You are Brett, right?\"

\"Yes?\"

\"See, I just don't know why someone would make up such lies.\"

\"Like what?\"

\"I don't know, I haven't read the whole thing, but Kristi (previously referred to as [Jane] in my older review) is my FRIEND and like here, you said the table was dirty, it was NOT. And I just, I don't know why someone would say such lies.\" And she went on (to use my girlfriend's word \"harassing us\") like this...

Wow. When I worked service, and someone was upset, you apologize, you try to make it better. \"The customer is always right.\" You don't stand there, rehashing old crap, and trying to prove that you're right. But she did, she kept digging that grave.

Our food came. It was still outstanding (and will be missed). The gentleman from the back continued to be a pleasant gentleman. Then Katie brings us the check.

Once again, I'm astonished by her words. She brought my change, picked up her shovel, dug deeper, and said, \"Look I don't know what you guys are trying to do, but management here really loves me here, so I don't know what you're trying to do or why, but whatever it is it's not going to work.\" 

I replied, \"it's not like we're out to get you or anything.\"

Wow, wow, just...wow... I am happy to pass this torch to my girlfriend, who was with me on both occasions and has more than enough credibility to speak for our experiences. I'm a glass-half-full kind of guy. I kept telling her to \"relax, calm down, and take the high road.\" I -STILL- hope they call her, redeem this place. Otherwise, Badger Cafe, your delicious food and OTHER servers will be sorely missed.

Girlfriend is currently writing her own review, and email through their website.

When I tipped, because I still just could not bring myself to stiff an entire place on the tip, I wrote on one of the bills, \"Because the guy with the bum legs deserves IT!\"

With a packed bar, she even thought she had the time to take out her tablet, argue with us constantly, and provide no service other than bringing the check. This should be a massive red flag. The gentleman brought out menus, food, drinks, refills, etc. I'm honestly baffled.

What did the managers/owners tell her to make her feel so invincible to customer complaints? What do they think she is doing? Do they really support this kind of behavior?"}
{"text":"Best hole in the wall place in town. Definitely worth the time to find. Irene was all smiles and great service. Dinner was great."}
{"text":"I can't believe I have lived near this cafe for 15 years and never gone in.  This is so much fun - I have to say that you should ignore the rest of the food (my hubby had the chicken fried steak and it was not great, even if the sausage gravy was pretty good!), I had the famous $3.99 half pound burger - and it was great great  great! Good seeded bun, toasted; hand formed burger grilled medium rare with wonderful non-greasy fried onions. And the fries were the best fries I think I have ever had - doubly crunchy and hot!  Raspberry tea was very very good and I'm one happy \"hidden jem\" finder!"}
{"text":"We stopped here for an afternoon snack.  You can order wings by the half dozen, dozen, or more.  We got the mild (not much flavor), lime (great), and blackened (amazing and charred).  Ask for the teriyaki sriracha sauce for dipping.  Cheap, friendly, small cafe style atmosphere.  You can step next door to the bar for a drink.  But, get the charred wings!"}
{"text":"Yes we only come here when we're at Rum Runner. But the food here is pretty damn good. First off the cheese curds are a great choice for a Wisconsin bar. The real gem here is the blackened wings. We saw it on the TVs in the bar and decided to try it. We're usually the ones that get the hottest wings on the menu but instead we did 6 Xtra hot, 6 blackened and they were perfect. The Xtra hot were very spicy but not unbearable and the blackened wings were like nothing I've had before. This bar went from being something we only went to when we wanted to play shuffleboard to somewhere we could go to for wings and be very happy."}
{"text":"I can see the potential! We ordered appetizer combo-- the best part was the badger bites.  It is a big combo so plenty to share with a couple friends!
For the meal we ordered chili size with chili cheese fries-- huge!! The hamburger patty itself was very good!! In fact think that if we return, we'll go for the build your own burger instead. The chili was only average.
Very friendly service-- can definitely tell it is a place frequented by locals-- casual and off the beaten path!"}
{"text":"Not the best dining experience I've had when basing my choices off Yelp. This place was rated relatively high so we decided to go. Came 9am Monday morning. Came in and sat down. Took more than five minutes for someone to talk to us despite it being empty other than a man at the bar. She came and took drink orders, dropped the waters we asked for and didn't return for another 10 min. We ordered a multitude of things due to the low pricing. Food was okay but we were in constant need of water refills but she never came back. When she finally did, there was a hair in my water. 

Overall, food was meh, atmosphere was dark and dirty and the staff could've been better. Will not be returning. 

I'm sure this place is better for wings and drunk food than breakfast."}
{"text":"Well worth the trip off of the strip. no rush, no fuss, no pressure, and good food. definitely worth a return trip."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good.. I got a burger and chili cheese fries (uhhhhg I need to cutback on the gut bombs) the food was good and the customer service was excellent. The prices are cheap and fair.  The area isn't the best but I've definitely been in worst haha. 
My buddies got the wings and said they were really good and great pricing."}
{"text":"I loooove hole in the walls and this a perfect example of it.

The Badger Cafe is tucked away in a strip mall close to UNLV. It looks really like a bar but closer inspection when coming in really does reveal a pleasant surprise.

Adjacent to the Rumrunner which is just a regular smokey bar, the Badger cafe serves up some of the best burgers in town for cheap! They give you a little silver of paper on which you can check of whatever topping you want. Bacon, mushrooms, guac, fried egg, whatever you want. You get a 100% customized burger right to your specifications, yum! On top of that, the fries are awesome. The beer battered spuds are perfectly crispy, and taste great. The prices are great, and you can even get wings with a great selection of sauces to toss em in.

Afterwards, you can head over to bar next door for some drinks. The two places are connected, so they will bring the food out to ya at the bar, or you can avoid it the second hand smoke and eat in their dining room.

Don't let the exterior fool ya, if you want awesome burger, check this place out."}
{"text":"As a college student, I always enjoy a good bar hopping from time to time.  I found one little enjoyable bar down the street from my house and campus called the Rum Runner.  Why am I saying this?  Well I've been to Rum Runner many times but i have never eaten at the restaurant that is literally next door, the Badger Cafe.  I can honestly say that I really enjoyed my dining experience here and I will come frequently.

The first thing you notice about this place it that it is a home of Wisconsin sports team.  What I mean by this is that there is a glass case with a Green Bay Helmet and University of Wisconsin Badger helmet.  The reason I say this is because I'm pretty sure no Viking or Lions fans will eat here but don't let that detract you the food is delicious!  I ordered one of their build your own burgers, which can get quite pricey if you want it fully loaded, but it is worth it!  I had a single cheeseburger with bacon, lettuce, grilled onions, fries and pickles which totaled out to be around $7.75 which is a pretty good deal.  The burger was not greasy and the beef was great.  The fires I am now a big fan of.  They are crunchy, golden brown, and just plain awesome sauce.  

If you want good cheap bar food, with friendly service look no further than badger cafe.  Once your done you can come next door and have a beer with me at Rum Runner every other week.  see you there!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan.
We were waiting feverishly to find out if we'd be signing a lease agreement...
The call came -yay!
We were stressed out,  had spent the previous 24 hours in a state of high
anxiety, with many miles to cover, anyway, we got the call to come sign the
lease agreement,  and we ended up at Badger Cafe, ready to eat.
My rueben sandwich was excellent, my sweeties sandwich was equally good. The
service was very friendly and competent as well. Nothing to bitch about. I would definitely eat at Badger Cafe again."}
{"text":"Wow! Beer battered French fries!  Who knew? Think I'm becoming a \"Bucky\" the Badger fan!  Very interesting cool local burger (and so much more) cafe in Vegas"}
{"text":"Had rotten tomatoes with our burgers all 5 of us. Waitress acted like oh well!!!! Wtf."}
{"text":"I usually love this place. The food is always delicious. I work close by, so my coworkers and I frequent this establishment weekly. Today was unbelievable! The waitress messed up on mine and my coworkers meal, and basically tried to blame us for the mistake! After we explained our order to her multiple times, her AND the cook say, \"It's really an easy fix.\" In a very condescending tone. Mind you, I didn't get loud or rude. She then proceeded to set down my food with force in front of me... I visually saw the cook grab spaghetti and wings with his bare hands!!! As if this wasn't enough, all of a sudden I hear barking inside the restaurant! They allowed a woman to bring in her small dog in a stroller into the RESTAURANT!!! The customers were feeding the dog in the stroller and allowed it to bark multiple times!! This place should seriously be closed down! I will never return!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by this place a few weeks ago because I work graveyard and it was kinda the only cafe style restaurant open very early.

The waitress who took my order was very nice, she cued me in on some of the best items on the menu. I ended up with a delicious hamburger steak topped with sautéed onions, hard to find at 7 in the morning!

Overall, it was a pretty pleasant experience. The soda was pretty flat, hence the four stars.

They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner all day. So coffee and toast or burgers and fries; whatever you're feelin!"}
{"text":"Badger Cafe was a good, fast and cheap option before our road trip. The waitress was very friendly and knew every single locals name. I thought that was very endearing.

My bf got the master omelette. It was a good sized portion for a big guy. Overall, it was good but quite cheesy.

I got the reg two scrambled eggs, whole wheat toast and hash browns. Please be aware the menu says potatoes. I'm thinking home fries but they are hash browns. All the same and just as yummy.

Toast with jelly was perfectly made. Reminded me of the great NY diners.

Breakfast was just under $13."}
{"text":"I've lived here for almost 6 years now and this is the first time I'm hearing of Badgers?  My husband and I decided to give it a try today and boy are we glad we did.  The menu has something for everyone and then some and the prices can't be beat!  My husband had the 1/2 lb burger, which is made and dressed to your liking and I went for the garlic hot sauced wings.  I was tickling the idea of getting the buffalo shrimp but I decided to save that for the next time.  The wings were just to my liking, moist and saucy and according to my husband this burger got the thumbs up.  I have to say this is a great little secret of Vegas and I'm so glad that we decided to try something new tonight.. And before I depart let me recommend the beer battered brats as a starter.. MmmMmmm.. Boy are they yummy"}
{"text":"What a hole in the wall!! When i take my friends here they are like how did you find this place? But when in Vegas ya gotta find the best deals around right!? Food is decient when you donot want to pay 20 bucks for breakfast at the NICE hotels or room service.. well they always treat me GREAT and the waitresses are always friendly.. the best!!"}
{"text":"I was intrigued by the ROTD and I live in the neighborhood so I had no other choice, but to try them out for myself. Upon entering you will immediately notice the smell of oil, but I shouldn't be complaining because this is a dive right where most of the menu items consist of fried food? Just looking around at the other patrons the crowd of this place is what this neighborhood used to be back in the early and mid 90's. I grew up here and it was a glimpse of what it used to be like before it got all ghetto. Anyway I ordered the wings to go half mild and the other half just the \"butter\" flavor because my mom is not fond of spicy food. I noticed when I paid there was .50 to go charge. Kind of weird, but oh well I guess? Tried both the mild and butter and I'd much rather prefer the mild. The butter wings were practically tasteless (just an fyi to anyone who contemplates on getting it). Just like my brother Rei B. mentioned even the cartilage is quit crisp. The wings were good, but unfortunately I'd much rather go to BBW for my wing fix.  However I'll be back to try the 3.99 burger, daily specials, and especially the brats since that's what Wisconsin is known for."}
{"text":"Burger is $5.49 now!
Less than a year ago, it was $4.99....year before that $3.99.

And the federal government says there's no inflation!"}
{"text":"Even with a hair baked into my nacho, I like this place. The cheese curds are tasty and the breakfast is a lot cheaper than other breakfast places. Sometimes they might be short on staff but don't let that ruin your experience. French toast and bacon for less than $5, you can't ask for a better deal. Don't come expecting a 5-star restaurant, but it's as good as it gets for a small diner."}
{"text":"this is a first for me but I'm adding a star for the service.  our server was really exceptional.  efficient and friendly but without being intrusive.  because it was my first visit I had to get the burger.  I ordered it medium rare.  it came out medium well.  the meat was good but a little too charred.  the bun was very fresh which I certainly appreciate but it's too much bread for my taste.  the real disappointment for me were the French fries.  they're truly gross.  I will go back when I'm on that side of town to try some other items on the menu, i'll just pass on the burgers and fries."}
{"text":"Look at my reviews.  I go to super expensive restaurants and buy bottle service at night clubs, so I obviously have great, expensive taste. The best. 

That being said, Badger Cafe is legit. Was in Vegas for a week and was tired of all the Strip food, and I had hit up all my usual places in Chinatown.  I wanted a steak, but not a $50 one. 

I google \"Vegas cheap steak,\" and Badger shows up. For $11, you get a steak, potato, toast, and soup. All of it was great. The food is really appetizing, and my mom was surprised that I finished everything. Yes, I brought my mom. She had a short stack of pancakes, btw, and they were good too. 

Bottom line, some here.  Yea, it's a dive, and if you're a tourist, kinda sketch, but if you have a car and want something local in Vegas, this is a great bet."}
{"text":"I had eaten here years before, in the pre-smoking ban days, but just went back today for lunch on the Badger side. It's pretty much smoke-free, so don't let that deter you!

I have not tried the wings yet, but the burgers are really good and really cheap.
They have a few other notable diner-type options as well, such as the BLT, hot beef sandwich, patty melt, etc.
Beers come from the Rum Runner next door and are also super cheap (like $4 for a 25oz Bud Light or $3.25 for PBR).
Thumbs up for being a true local place (despite the Wisconsin theme, of course).
They're locally-owned, the waitresses know most of the patrons, and they host regular pool tournaments."}
{"text":"I LOVE greasy spoon diners, the dirtier and greasier, the better. I was excited to try Badger Cafe after hearing such glowing recommendations from locals. Boy, they were so wrong! The place has the dive vibe just right, with an old school interior, cheap prices, and a location in a strip mall, but the food here is really bad. 

I visited with two friends and the three of us ate lunch for around $25 total. It's cheap, but the old adage is true: you get what you pay for. We ordered the fried zucchini, a pastrami sandwich without the bread, and a bacon cheeseburger without the bread. All three items were of an extremely poor quality. But then again, I didn't have to pay much for the food. 

The fried food (fried zucchini and french fries) was the best thing we had, but that's not saying much. It tasted like frozen, mass produced zucchini that was simply dumped in the fryer. There's nothing wrong with that, but don't come in here expecting fresh, hand-cut zucchini. The french fries were freaking amazing, but it's hard to mess up fries! They were those super duper crispy, double-battered and fried fries, and they are amazing. That's the only thing I'd ever come back to eat here (but again, they are obviously frozen and straight from a bag). 

The pastrami sandwich didn't fare as well. The pastrami was okay but bland, and the cheese on top wasn't real cheese and instead was processed cheese food. So gross. The cheeseburger was the absolute worst thing on the table. Once I got through the decent toppings (bacon and grilled onions), I hit the fake cheese and then the \"beef.\" This beef was totally a FROZEN preformed patty, like those kind that come from the giant tube. The meat was of questionable quality and had the consistency of a hockey puck. It was so terrible. I love cheeseburgers and eat them every week and this one was one of the WORST I have EVER been served ANYWHERE in the world. 

The cole slaw side was super sweet and -- you guessed it -- straight from a bulk food service pail. I get that restaurants can't always make homemade food, but everything we were served was straight off the Sysco delivery truck. 

At least it was super cheap."}
{"text":"By far the best wings in Vegas! Whats even better about this place is the price. I went with 3 people, all together we had 18 wings, a burger combo, fried chicken special combo, and a spicy pastrami combo!! Drum roll please.......$32.00, for that price we all said it was some of the tastiest food for how cheap it was. All in all id give this place 100 stars and i will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Really simple dinner food. Nothing to write home about but it sure fills the spot at 3 AM or hungover the next afternoon."}
{"text":"Been wanting to come here for awhile. The service was not the greatest. Our drink order was taken by a guy who was dressed like a bus boy/prep cook. Then we sat there waiting for our waitress. We sat for quite awhile. When she did arrive she was really friendly. 

We had a BLT and a burger. The BLT was done perfectly. Ice cold lettuce, nicely toasted bread and salty, crisp bacon. The burger was great. Nice charbroiled flavor and perfectly medium rare as ordered. It was a small diner area, but the Rum Runner seemed too smoky to eat. The food was great, so we will be back."}
{"text":"The quintessential neighborhood diner. Come in, sit wherever you'd like, enjoy the game on tv. Breakfast lunch and dinner 24/7. Relatively small menu with daily specials- most of the food is very good. Build-your-own-burger for the win! Price is very modest, and all servers are so nice and interactive with guests. Our favorite lady works mornings...I wish I knew her name.
This little gem is attached to Rumrunner's bar next door and the servers and cooks typically have to run back and forth between the two at peak business times, so you could potentially be waiting a very long time for your food. It's happened to us a lot over the years. Badger's is very dear to us, and although the rest of the experience is always very good, I had to take off a star for that. They just need to do better with their staffing. Other than that, a must try for locals and I highly recommend! 
Ps UNLV students...it's about a 5 minute drive from campus. Makes a great place to sit down and have a bite when you feel like getting off campus and away from students for awhile. They'll take care of you here."}
{"text":"Wonderful burger and fries. This was my first time here, but God willing it won't be my last!! The burger is real meat!!! I am feeling full!!"}
{"text":"Go for burger, we ordered Chili - Size unfortunately.  The chili tasted like hormel so you can imagine, it was average."}
{"text":"Now I must admit I've only been here for Packer games. It's an old bar that hasn't changed much over the past 20 years. 

This place will never be a 5 star but it never claims to be a classy joint. It's a step above a dive bar but what makes this place my home for packer games is the people who come to watch the games. 

It's Wisconsin people! They're friendly and welcoming and always welcome fans of the opposing team. The drinks are reasonably priced and the food is on the upper echelon when it comes to bar food. 

Breakfast 24/7 and great burgers. 

The place does smell like smoke and you may be eating on a pool table but that's part of the charm."}
{"text":"Tried the build a burger and the wings very good quality. The burger was high-quality Angus beef cooked on charcoal grill very good flavor.
The french fries were a little bit off somewhat of a fish flavor I guess from the oil.

Reasonable prices and good portions. 

The wings were exceptionally good and then done on a charcoal grill after having the hot sauce put on a very nice flavor. very fresh really enjoyed them."}
{"text":"\"Hole in the Wall\", \"Hidden Gem\", \"Generic Secret Location Phrase\", yeah yeah I get it. I just have a major pet peeve with overused cliches.

I first found out about this place from a coworker who loved going there during packers games because it's known as a \"Packer Bar\". But that is Rum Runner we are talking about, which is connected to Badger Cafe. They both are one and the same, but I'll talk about the food in this review.

The restaurant area is nice and tidy, has a dive / diner type of feel and it's quite busy most of the time. Customer service is great and so is the speed of food delivery (it obvious varies depending on nuts it is inside Rum Runner).

Anyways, $3.99 for a half pound burger plus an additional $1 for extra fries. This is easily one of the better burgers in town, it's a great value no matter how you look at it. I've been a regular here for months now. 

I'm majorly addicted to the fried, they are completely beer battered and are phenomenal tasting. I have no need to add salt or any other seasonings, the fries stand on there own. This and very crispy, just thinking about them makes me want to drive there right now for some fries.  If the owners are reading this, add another item on your menu that is a bucket of fries for $4.99 or something. I will be there every day!

The parking area is mostly packed for reasons I don't understand and it's around a quite questionable neighborhood. The appeal of this place is similar to my favorite bar back in Michigan, it's in a rough neighborhood with some scumbags hovering around (I guess that's why my coworker has been going there for years, scumbag) but the food is so great. It's like an urban risk/reward game, maybe I'll get hassled by hobo's, or maybe I'll get an awesome deal and meal. 

It get's extra points for being able to order from inside the cafe and they will bring the food out to Rum Runner for you. 

Food, Deals, Service, it's got all of that. I strongly recommend  coming here if you can!

{"text":"Still holding strong at 4 Stars, Badger Cafe has a safe place nestled in my heart. When I know I want grease and burgers and to walk away smelling like a fry cook I come here.

Last time my husband and I went the place was packed, although we were able to find a seat, we did wait for quite awhile to not only place our drink orders, but also our food orders.

However, the waitress wasn't just standing around doing nothing. Yes, THE waitress, the only one in a restaurant with packed tables, also serving food to the bar next door, and bar-side seating in front of the kitchen. She was hustlin'. Plus she is super nice and in-yo-face. Which, some people will like, others will not. She will sit down next to you and take your order. Seriously, expect it. 

Anyway, this place is for a special kind of people. But the food is amaze. Burgers are the best. Always done right and to your specifications. Plus, it's cheap."}
{"text":"Delicious meaty wings that come in different sauces.  The blue cheese dressing is the bomb and the build your own burger is epic! Also the beer battered fries are yummy! I love this place! love the staff they are always so good to me! Definitely a favorite for many years now."}
{"text":"This is a very authentic mom and pop diner off the strip in Las Vegas. It's not glitzy, new, modern, big, or very 'vegas'. Which is nice if you're looking for a change of pace from the strip.

It's very much a locals driven joint. And that's because the food is good, the service friendly (although a bit slow and a little lacking at times), and the prices are cheap.

I ordered the fish and chips, which I thought meant fish and fries, but they make their own homemade potato chips, so I was surprised and delighted when I received crunchy potato chips straight from the fryer. My order came with a side of soup, I picked the chicken and it was surprisingly good. 

My friends and I sat at the counter, the tables that were available were too cramped. The counter was okay, sometimes some smoke from the kitchen would waft over in a cloud. 

Otherwise, as a LA tourist going off the strip, this place was pretty good."}
{"text":"So after eating here for over a year and ordering the same roast beef dip because it has no cheese or dairy I was screwed over by an inconsiderate cook and an even worse waitress. The cook added cheese to my sandwich. Under the meat. Why?? No idea. So here I sit, writing this review from the emergency room. What address do I send the bill to? I'm not joking. I have now been trying to figure out what kind of cheese it was for the doctor they keep refusing to answer and hanging up on us. They really will not tell the doctor or I what kind of cheese it was . they don't care how sick I get."}
{"text":"In Vegas it is always good to find 24 hour places that have decent food.  Early one morning after work, I stopped by here because I was craving a taste of the Midwest.  They have a great menu with good prices.    

I'm a former Minnesotan so it was with trepidation that I went to a Wisconsin themed restaurant, but I'm very glad I did.  The bratwurst bites were amazing!  The rest of the food I tried was pretty good as well.  It was good to get a taste of the Midwest and even though they're a Wisconsin bar, this former Minnesotan will be back, just not on Badger/Packer game days."}
{"text":"This is my first time here and I really like the down home feel that it gives you. There's a bar that's attached next door which seems to be pretty big. The restaurant portion is small so I don't recommend groups over 5-7 people. I had the NY steak and eggs and they cooked it medium rare to perfection! My BF had the Patty Melt with fries and he said it was VERY good!! We're both stuffed and will come back here the next time we're in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Food  = average.
Green Bay fans = WAY above average!
Server/waitress = Awesome!
Bartender = super fast and impressive!

Look, I'm a Packers fan, so expect my review to be biased. 

I showed up at 950AM for a 10AM Packers game, I had a couple of options for seating, which was impressive in itself.  We ended up choosing to share a community table on the patio to avoid the smoke inside.  There were 10 people split between two tables and one giant TV...it was incredible.  (IS incredible. I'm here right now.)

The food was nothing mind-blowing, but the prices were fantastic.  The server was SO sweet and the bartender was very attentive.  I'll come here again for big Green Bay games for sure.  

This place screams Midwest....great patrons, awesome staff, and a sense of community."}
{"text":"I used to come here a while ago, not regularly though. 

I've had their tuna melt, pancakes, wings, fries, etc. their tuna melt was really good. It comes with fries & you can never really go wrong with fried potatoes! The pancakes were okay, nothing really special about them. I remember the bacon being pretty greasy, but idr too well. The most recent thing I had was spicy garlic wings. I've never had spicy garlic anything so I don't have anything to compare it to. The flavor wasn't bad. I wish they fried it better but it was okay! The cheese curds were pretty great.

Service was a little slow, but there was only one server & there was a good amount of people there. She was nice enough to give us free fries though!"}
{"text":"We frequent a wash and fold laundry in the same run down shopping plaza where the Badger Cafe is located, but have never noticed it before.  I was initially hesitant to even enter, but it turned out to be a pretty ordinary coffee shop that primarily serves as the restaurant for the adjoining Rum Runner Lounge.  My wife ordered coffee, French toast and bacon while I chose easy over eggs, sourdough toast and hash browns.  Everything was spot on with service to match."}
{"text":"Awesome service, and very reasonably priced.

This is my new favorite place off the strip for breakfast. It is exactly the type of place I've been looking for. You can tell a lot of locals go here. The chef was even pre-setting a table with coffee, water and newspapers for 4. Reminds me of some of the old-school diners back in NJ.

Badger bites are a must have. They are little smokies with cheese and jalapenos in a won-ton wrapper!

I had the badger bites, skillet, french toast. Only gave 4 stars because my food was a bit under-seasoned, but nothing that a little salt and pepper didn't fix!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stumble across this place a couple years ago. At first, we intended to go to a different food place, but since the place was closed, and we were starving, we settled on this place. And are we glad we did.

While we can hardly call ourselves regulars, we've been here on several occasions, especially during the UNLV school year. We've never been disappointed in the food, and have even introduced friends to the place (none of which we disappointed). 

Food: they have an awesome deal on wings and burgers. We always for for this deal. You won't be disappointed by either. 
Wings: The wings are a good size, never small or dry. 24 wings, which is way more than enough for the two of us, is only $16 and some change. They have  large range of sauce choices. My favorite that I've had so far is Spicy Garlic.
Burgers: $3.99 for a fresh 1/2 lb burger isn't a bad deal at all. There are a few extra charges for certain toppings, but it will hardly ever come out to more than $10 for the burger. 
Fries: Oh my God these fries. Beer-battered fries. They are amazing. They are  crispy, delicious, and only $1 an order with the wing or burger deal. If you ever go, please try the fries. They are hands down the best fries I've ever had. 

Service: I have yet to have any rude service here. The waitresses we've encountered have all been very nice and friendly. I actually went today, and missed the name of our waitress, but she was the sweetest lady. She was in her mid to late 20s, I think.  I really wish I caught her name because it was the best service I've had there yet."}
{"text":"Wow. In one visit, you guys go down the shitter.

NEWSFLASH: The fucking smoking ban has NOT been lifted yet. This means, when I come in, and find you propping your door to the bar open, and the restaurant reeks of smoke... and I ask you (yes you, new shithead cook) why the door is propped open, and point out that it's illegal to do so at this point in time, do NOT sit there arguing with me then get snotty and go \"Well do you want your drinks or not?\"

Sadly, you've lost our business. There are bigger and better places around, and you need to realize where your money comes from. We won't be coming back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend & I decided to go grab a bite to eat before heading out for the night. We saw on Yelp that this place was a good place for burgers so we stopped in.

It's a small little place connected to the Rum Runner (a bar), so we grabbed a seat & chose what toppings we wanted on our burgers & apps we wanted to start with. The little family that runs this place seemed frantic & out of it. The waitress that came over to take our order was a bit negative about her night but seemed nice or like she just had a run in with a bad customer. (Those are the worst, I know because I'm a server too).. 

I ordered a burger med well with the normal toppings (which she forgot some of them) & an iced tea. The tea tasted bad so I drank my water instead. I ordered the cheese curds which were good, but they were just smaller versions of mozzarella sticks. 

All in all, the burgers were a good price, tasted delicious but I feel like the family that runs that place should be a bit more professional & may need a lesson in being a bit more happy & not tell other customers about how shitty their night was!"}
{"text":"I was told the wings are amazing, but I don't agree.  I prefer my wings dry, like at T-Bird or Tap House, where they either use a dry rub for spice, or they will spin them in wet sauce and put them back on the grill to roast and dry out, so the skin is crispy and spicy.  The wing meat and skin here was average, and the sauce was wet, which is some people's bag, but not mine.  Cool krab cocktail though!  ;-D"}
{"text":"So simple but great food. Hash browns were cooked to perfection. Fast service and nostalgic atmosphere"}
{"text":"Stopped in and tried the burger & fries... It was Really good, not the best ever but solid. Menu has plenty of options and very reasonably priced. Ill be back!"}
{"text":"Update: I stopped in, hungover as all hell, on my way to the airport. 

Other than the Build-you-own-burger going up in price ($3.99 now), everything was the same. 

There was the same super-friendly service, the same delicious spicy bloody marys from the bar, and the same juicy burgers and fiery hotwings. I brought my grandmother for her first time, and she was impressed. That's a good sign.

Dear Badger Cafe, please open a new location in Nashville. Love, Heather"}
{"text":"Server was extremely friendly food portions were great and very generous  something that stood out was the hospitality of the workers and the cleanliness of the establishment"}
{"text":"I come here for one reason. It's the chicken wings. They are ginormous and cheap. They're perfectly fried to a well done even the cartilage is crispy too. The cartilage is one of the best parts. Don't knock it until you try it! Try them with any sauce; all good.

Best wings in Vegas by a mile. Where else can you find hot, juicy, crispy and cheap wings? The $3.99 burger and other food items are good too but the wings are the main attraction for me."}
{"text":"Badger Cafe has won my heart.

My fiancé and I were looking for a simple cafe to grab a burger tonight - nothing fancy or pretentious.  We got exactly what we were looking for at Badger Cafe.

The made-to-order burgers are fan-freaking-tastic.  I don't really care for burgers all that much, and I'm rarely in a burger mood.  However, I love the burgers at Badger Cafe.  I was surprised at how un-greasy mine was - it tasted really fresh, and the bun was delicious and flaky.  The grilled onions were amazing.... reminded me of eating White Castle during my adolescence (I'm from Missouri).

We also got an order of the wings.  They are on the small side, but I really like that - sometimes the big wings are gristly and tough.  The skin was flaky and amazing.  I would come back just for the wings sometime, but next time I'll get a hotter sauce.  The medium isn't hot at all.

Best of all, the service was friendly.  It was the kind of place \"where everybody knows your name\" (*cue Cheers theme song*).  My fiancé and I spent a good chunk of time reminiscing about our first date, which was in a diner not too different from the Badger Cafe (awwwww).  The place just felt home-y like that.  

Highly recommended.  It kinda looks like a dive, but give it a try.

**EDIT:  Holy mother of hot wings.  Their wings are crazy good.  They're small and crispy, but the sauces are delicious.  We always get a mix of BBQ and their hottest hot wings (which are the perfect level of heat - doesn't burn your face off, but stings a little bit).  They are even better than the burgers... if that's even possible... my mind is sufficiently blown."}
{"text":"We found this place on Yelp and had no idea what to expect. It was dark from the outside and the windows had all these large stickers all over it so it didn't give a good impression at first. However, all feelings of reservation were gone after we were warmly greeted by Ashlee and received our appetizers. We had their delicious fried zucchini, which we highly recommend. The rest of our food came out and it was also delicious and great in quality, value, and proportion. Ashlee went so far as to find us crayons for my kids and check on us several times. Exceptional service. We would come again!"}
{"text":"The Pros: The food was pretty good. I had eggs on a roll. The cook was very nice and personable.
The Cons: The tall black woman server. She was the worst!!! She would get negative stars if I could. I sat down about 5 minutes before she even came out. The cook let me order straight to him and started my order before I saw her. She came out and asked what I wanted to drink, told her milk. Those were the last words she spoke to me. The milk was bad, I told her, not a word said to me, just brought a new one. Put my food down in front of me, again, nothing said, do you need anything else? Nothing... Finished eating, she put the bill down, again, nothing said, do you want anything else?  So, I hope she got the message when I left her a $.45 tip. That was the change from the order. Oh, I forgot to mention, I was the ONLY one in there...
If you hate your job, go get a new one!!!

So...For decent food that is inexpensive, go here, but if you want decent or better service, go elsewhere...This server was one of the worst I have ever experienced, and I eat out a lot and travel all over..."}
{"text":"The food is good but the service was terrible.
It was not busy but only one waitress working. She was doing a great job. Taking care of the 8 customers in the cafe and orders in the bar.
Just not us. It was like we were invisible. Passed by our table twice. The cook came and asked of we have been helped. Got us our drinks and said the waitress would be with us.
15 minutes later she asked if we needed drinks from about 30 feet away. We told her we had them and would like to order. She replied\"she would be right there\". 5 minutes later we order. 
She was talking and laughing with everyone there and even a take out order.
Maybe we were in her blind spot?
Terrible service."}
{"text":"Decent 1/2 lb build-your-own burger for under $6.  If you are east of the strip or a UNLV student and have a late night hankering for cheap bar food, then this place is for you.   My preference is to order the food to go and chow down in the comfort of your own home.  After all, this is a no frills kind of place."}
{"text":"Go for the wings! Service will never leave you disappointed, and the prices are pretty good. Hole in the wall vibes, but perfect for late nights and cheap eats."}
{"text":"I love this please for the burgers it's amazing but everything on the menu is tasty service is ok to good if they are jam on a football night they are usually under staff but they're friendly 

Its all about the prices here this food should be priced higher but it's same worth the money here"}
{"text":"Best burger in Vegas hands down! Badger Cafe is connected to the Rum Runner, so you can eat in the bar and get 24 oz. beers for only $4.50 

You build your own 1/2 pound burger for $3.99 and it is AWESOME!! I would highly suggest getting their wings. They are just as good as the burger. They have around 12 different sauces and a flavor of the month. 

The staff here is great and you will want to go back. They make you feel like they have known you for years."}
{"text":"$3.99 is the starting price. Lettuce, onions, pickles, grilled onions, and mayo are free options. For $.30 each, you can get double cheddar, double swiss, ranch, or tomatoes. $.60 gets you guacamole or grilled mushrooms. And $.75 gets bacon, a fried egg, or fries. When it is all said and done, a monster burger can be had for less than $10. 

Although it lists an option for how you want your burger cooked, my medium rare came out medium well. The one waitress and one cook was pumping out food as fast as they could so I just sucked it up. Overall, the burger was good. The diner smelt of grease, but the food was not drenching in oil like other places. The mushrooms came out flavorful, but not covered in oil. I appreciated that. The cheese curds ($4.99) was my favorite item. Can never go wrong with fried cheese. There is a $1 to go box fee if you do not order a drink."}
{"text":"I've been going here for years and went I went recently with my family, the cook was very very rude. My order was messed up and he wouldn't stop yelling about it as if it were my fault ! This was absolutely embarrassing and insulting . I know it's a small diner and all , but seriously who treats a guest like that ?! The server was nice though and the food ended up being really good . I would try their build your own burgers"}
{"text":"Even though they've raised their price a buck...at $4.99 Badgers build your own burger is still a tasty bargain. My son and I had the burger..wife had a BLT. all gave it high grades. feel as though we got a flavor of the real las Vegas...not some cookie cutter chain deal. There are some \"sketchy\" characters patronizing this spot...but overall its a solid thumbs up. Service was fine...food was good...and the price is right!"}
{"text":"We went to the badger Café for the Fish n Chips on a Friday night the beer was cold from the bar the fish n chip were cook perfect.  The service was as cold as the beer....  Really crappy service....  

We will try again in a few weeks!"}
{"text":"So I stumbled upon this little gem after yelp surfing on my phone and boy I wasn't disappointed.

I met my boyfriend here for some bar food without the smoke. Sometimes smoke alone can ruin the experience. The rum runner bar was hopping but we were the only sit down people at the cafe based on yelp reviews we weren't worried. The waitress was super friendly and chatty with us while we decided what to order. We filled out the cards specially laid out for the wings and burgers.
He ordered 12 wings two different styles hot and bbq hot and french fries.
I had the burger mid well, tomato, double cheese and 1000 island on the side. 
Our food arrived *check out my pic called omg lets eat!*, and we were in heaven. My burger was cooked just right, bun was toasted, juicy but not overly juicy to where it made the bun wet and nasty, cheese was melted to perfection. His wings were plump and juicy not one small one in the batch. Fries were hot and crunchy. Two sides of ranch, carrots and celery without having to ask or being charged extra? Love it!! Take notes Bdubs!  

For two our bill came to 15.80 + 4.00 cash for tip.
And we were full and satisfied with the service we received and the food was great! We will be back to try some different things on the menu! 
Why is my mouth watering writing this review!!!!?!!!?!?!?! :-)

If your in the area try this place out! A bargain for a great meal and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Wow. Don't know who took over, but this place went downhill FAST. Went here about a month ago. Did the build-your-own burger as I normally do. I ordered it well done, as usual. I had to send it back TWICE because they gave it to me raw. Afterwards, I said fuck it, and just went home. This time, the tomato's and lettuce tasted like chemicals. Yuck. Screw this place."}
{"text":"Excellent greasy spoon diner, don't be afraid to come in, the food here is excellent and very cheap. After two days of eating on the strip we were sick of overpriced mediocre burgers. Badger cafe is attached to a neighborhood bar, Rum Runner, and was 15 minutes off the strip in suburbia. I had a chopped salad with chicken, it was simple and fresh and very tasty. My co conspirator had great pancakes, eggs and bacon at 11pm at night. Definitely worth the trip for good comfort food."}
{"text":"Recently discovered this hidden gem and now it turns out to be one of the favorite spots for me and my buddies to hang out, after playing some pool at the rum runner bar, with a couple beers and some chicken wings we always finish off with a killa burger custom made, i like mine with a friend egg,ortega chili, bacon, American cheese, grilled onions and 1000 island can't beat that and can't beat that price either. Best thing is its open 24/7, can't get a better burger than that after hours."}
{"text":"I really wanna give this place 5 stars, but can't...It's a Golden gem with some of the city's best bar food.. 

Not worth 5 stars cuz: It's smokey from the connected bar. If you're not a smoker, it's the grossest thing in public. Should be against the law to smoke in public. The portions are inconsistent. I usually order the breakfast skillet. Whether 2am, or 12noon, sometimes it fills the skillet with a heap of yummy goodness and sometimes it's LITERALLY half the amount. No, not a smaller \"lunch\" portion. Just inconsistent portions. Plus small extra things are \"just\" soso, like their toast. 

Why it's worth 5 stars: Beer-battered brat bites! So frigen good. I get one or two orders every time I visit. Love em. The waitresses are usually pretty damn nice and friendly. Even if they are being fake, I don't care. They're not my friends, haha. The breakfast skillet is one of the tastiest in town, and a great deal for 8 bucks (when you get the normal full portion). Very large menu, with great prices."}
{"text":"My partner read about this place on Yelp and we decided to go there last Sunday after church. My original thought from outside was \"Wow, what a dive.\" We went into the wrong door and sat in the Rumrunner. It was stale  and smoky and I wasn't going to stay. It was then that I looked over and saw the cafe. We originally thought it was a different place until we saw that the menu was for Badger Cafe. My, am I glad we stayed. I love the idea of building your own burger. Immediately, I was impressed with that and the fact that prices were so reasonable. Michelle (I believe) was very helpful and friendly. We received our meals quickly. The burger was delicious. The fries were good also. I didn't really like the iced tea, but who cares about that. I was there for the burger and was not disappointed. I love supporting local businesses and I will definitely go back when I want a great burger."}
{"text":"My wife brought me here for my birthday and meet some friends to play pool next door.  I grew up in Wisconsin, so I am always a little leery of places that claim to have Wisconsin cuisine.  The food was very good and did remind of something I would get at greasy spoon back home, and decor certainly reminded me of WI.  It's very small and a little divey, it was clean, just a little worn.  The service is a little off.  There were a few times my wife sent me to the counter to order things, as the server had not been seen for a while.  It wasn't a bad experience, but we haven't been back either."}
{"text":"Went last night with the family as we discovered this place isn't barely a block away from home. We enjoyed ourselves. 

Husband ordered a \"Build Your Own Burger\" and from what I saw it was a good burger. He inhaled it along with their fries. 

My son ordered wings and fries from the kids menu. And he enjoyed it too. The fries were abundant and he actually was too stuffed to finished them. 

I ordered the blackened wings with bleu cheese and fries. I left the bone completely clean. They were spicy enough for my experienced palate to take a step back to appreciate the spice. Blackened to perfection. And my fries were great too. 

Next time I'll order the same wings but I def want to give the chips (made fresh to order) a try."}
{"text":"The place doesn't look like much, but it deserves a 5star rating. It's clean, the service was great, it was cheap, and the food was good. 
My boyfriend had the chicken fried steak breakfast style (with hashbrowns, toast, and eggs rather than with mashed potatoes and I forget what else) and we ordered  some wings just to try 'em. An order of beer battered fries along with it for just 75cents more-- heaven! The wings were juicy and delish, and his plate was scrumptious and artery clogging.  I had a simple salad (hey, I was trying to cancel out the fries), and it actually turned out to be pretty tasty too. 
Even after making the boyfriend eat a couple bites of salad he insisted on mopping up his leftover yolk and gravy with some toast wedges. 
It was that good."}
{"text":"Oh Badger Cafe, how far you have fallen. Many days and nights, my broke college-going self would make my way through your doors, the juicy, hand-pressed burgers were right in my budget and oh-so delicious!

The last few times we have gone in for burgers, there were problems. Not serious enough to write you off, we would wait a little while, then head back and try again. Problems again. 

What kind of problems you ask?
- The past FIVE times, my wife has ordered grilled mushrooms on her burger. The past FIVE times, she has received ZERO mushrooms on her burger.
- Every third time or so, your food works like McDonald's and Burger King - a la a guaranteed intestinal cleanse. Not pleasant at all.
- The size of the mayo/thousand island cups has shrunk to where a french fry folded in half is as wide as the mouth of the cup. Seriously?!
- Finally, despite re-assurances from the staff, there is no way in hell those are hand-pressed burgers. So dry, tough and flavorless, That is the signature of pre-made patties.*

If the burger maintained its hand-pressed tastiness, we could get over the other items, or at least, feel up for the gamble of if we had to race home and to the bathroom. No sense in continuing to support food that declined so much.

Also, having staff engaging in lengthy discussions about how much they hate other staff members that aren't there, with each other - and regular customers, is very unprofessional. If you have an issue with that person, talk to them, deal with it, shut up or quit. I don't want to feel involved in your drama, because that is the only thing that could be heard in the restaurant.



* I used to flip burgers and hand press 40-50 lbs of burgers a couple times a week, I have some experience in this area."}
{"text":"Visited on Saturday September 3, 2016 around 9AM.  This restaurant is located on Tropicana at Spencer.  It's in the same shopping center as Gorilla Sushi and attached to Rum Runner.  I wasn't so sure if kids were allowed but they said it was alright to bring our toddler in. There is a sign on the door that says after 10 pm minors must be accompanied by an adult.  

Anyhoo....this greasy spoon may be one of the last divey mom n' pop places left in Vegas.  The place is dated in a cool, retro way and still has barstools and a cool round spinny-ticket-holder-thingy in the kitchen.  Our server was a mother and a veteran and just as friendly as they come.  

The food is cheap as hell and all three of us ate here for like $17 bucks.  They seem to specialize in breakfast and \"drunk foods\" like chicken wings and burgers.  

For $5.59 I got the \"pan-san\" which came with eggs any way you want, pancakes, and bacon.  I would have paid much, much more for this.  The pancakes were huge and fluffy and perfectly cooked.  The bacon was so thick but still crispy and the eggs were perfectly scrambled and buttery.  It was the *perfect* breakfast.  

My husband said his breakfast burrito was good but the tortilla was really hard in some places.  He just tore off the bad spots and said he enjoyed the rest.  The biscuits and gravy were not the best I've ever had but were adequate and clearly homemade.  The biscuits tasted a lot like uncooked flour so maybe they were a bit undercooked but they were hard so I think maybe they were just not the freshest.  

I can imagine if you were at the bar next door this place would be like manna from heaven as far as drunk food goes.  But for normal (sober) folks like me this is just A-OKAY."}
{"text":"This place hits the value/quality/quantity mark on the nose. They have daily specials, I had the pot roast dinner for $7 included a salad, mashed potatoes, green beans, garlic bread, and a nice sized portion of moist and tasty pot roast. That, my friends, is a bargain!

The salad came in a bowl and included plenty of tomatoes, cheese, cucumbers along with lettuce. I've had worse salads at more expensive places. The gravy wasn't over salted, which I find in a lot of places. 

They are located next to Rum Runner bar on Tropicana and Spencer. Many of the bar patrons ordered food and from what I could see it all looked good. You can byob (build your own burger). The nightly specials are what stood out to me, I can see myself eating Lasagna on Tuesdays, and Garlic Parmesian Chicken on Sundays a lot!

Seems to be plenty of parking, so no worries here."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick bite before dropping friend at the airport and making my drive home to phoenix. We kept driving away from the strip because we didn't want to spend too much money but we also didn't want fast food, so we ended here. 

First glances from outside, I questioned our decision but actually it's quite cute and diner style inside. Our waitress was very nice but seemed to be the only one working, which not many tables in the diner but I think the bar on the other side was her job as well. 

They have really great prices and lots to choose from of diner style food. One friend got the BLT with fries (she liked hers, fries were awesome), another the nachos (they looked okay....), and myself the quesadilla. The reason I'm rating this place a 3 and not a 4 and it's very in between those marks was because of a few issues. One, I was freezing, they have the fans blowing at high speed, poor little couple that were there had to move to this tiny table that seemed the only spot where it wasn't as cold. Two, she wrote down the order and even repeated almost everything that were on the dishes back to us... My friend who got nachos was missing the jalapeños, and I order the quesadilla no tomatoes and repeated it twice.... I got tomatoes and my food came out 5 minutes after my friends. I was too hungry to say anything and on a time crunch to ask to have it fixed. Also the quesadilla was suppose to have Ortega chilies, pretty sure it got the jalapeños that were suppose to be on the nachos. On the plus side, the quesadilla was really good, and the tomatoes were very minimal it didn't ruin the flavor for me. Not sure where the error was and I understand it happens, so that's why I'm not rating any lower. 

It's actually a cute spot, I just might have gotten an off day."}
{"text":"This is a quaint, tiny cafe connected to a micro casino with a bar. They are open 24 hours a day and they have an extensive menu for a small diner and apparently they serve everything all day and all night. 

The prices are really cheap and the food is your basic diner type dishes, let's just say it's similar to Denny's food but half the price and certainly tastes better.

They have a huge empty parking lot if you're a trucker."}
{"text":"I swear this was the second best meal I had in Vegas, first was Gordon Ramsey Steak...seriously good food, fresh and good portions.  My husband was so bummed we found this plaace the day before flew home.  He said the wings were the best he's ever had.  Very generous kid meal portions and the 3.99 build a burger is so worth it.  Check this place out!"}
{"text":"Its taken me a while but I finally got back to the Badger Cafe during dinner hours.  I was fairly impressed with both my burger and the wings. 

The burger was thick and juicy I ordered it medium and it was a little medium rare but otherwise perfect. The toppings were a thick slice of tomato a nice layer of lettuce and some grilled onions. A vadallia onion would have been perfect  but oh so good as it was. I didnt like that the guacamole and Mayo were in plastic containers as the mayo looked old and past its prime but still glad it was there and not on the burger as it may have ruined the Burger.

The wings were perfectly fried. Crunchy on the outside and juicy on the inside. The sauce was the hottest they had and my tastebuds could hardly tell. I didnt blow my nose till the end of the meal. A better sauce would put these wings at the top of my list for wings in Vegas."}
{"text":"The menu at Badger is simple and basic, the way bar food should be. And the prices are cheap to! So add those two combined with a build your own burger and you have a recipe for success in my book. My friends and I regularly visit this fine establishment a few times a month and the food nor the service has failed us yet. 

Extra points for the dive bar atmosphere!"}
{"text":"These guys have no class and no respect. I ordered well before 7 other customers, and each of them got their food before me. This place sucks royally. Please boycott this place until they learn some tact."}
{"text":"I am a fan. There hasn't ever been a time when I have had company come in town to visit and I didn't take them to this place.

Seriously, you cannot go wrong with the burgers, wings, fries and onion rings in this place.

The burgers are all made to order and you simply check on your Menu Sheet what you want on your burger and how you want it cooked. Same goes with the wings, how many wings, what flavors, what sides, etc. 

It's the best cheap eats around. Seriously. 

Sometimes the service can be a little slow especially when the bar next door is extremely busy so do not come here in a rush. Lay back and enjoy the moment and cheap food you are about to experience. If you take your burger to go, please note that they charge you a dollar extra."}
{"text":"This little restaurant is situated next to the billiard bar and it looks like it's pretty famous among the locals. We ordered fried shrimp and mushroom. And everything tastes really good. My bf said their diet soda was the best in town. The lady who works their was super friendly and helped us to order. In my opinion, the prices are a little bit high for a place off the strip."}
{"text":"Well, this was my second visit, and unfortunately will be my last visit. My first visit was fine, and what brought me back was, Built your Burger. You fill out a menu card with what you want want on your Burger and how you want your Angus meat cooked, I did, with my burger to be Medium Rare. 
Burger arrived in timely manner, Only one other customer, besides me. One bite into the burger and I had to remove the Dry over cooked meat from my mouth. Now I'm seating at the counter, stone throw from the cook and the young waitress, I pushed the plate away from me with the meat exposed along with the hamburger. Mintues go by and I ask the waitress for my check, as she started to walk away to get check I said that the Burger was terrible, and showed her the over cooked meat. Did not offer to replace or offer not to pay for it. She brings the check, she runs my CC, I payed and started to get up from my chair and then and only then did they offer me another burger to go. I declined because of the quality of the burger and the way it was cooked.
If your looking for a decent burger, this is definitely not the place. I would go to Burger King before I would ever return to this joint."}
{"text":"I like this place open 24/7 the lady manager or owner idk what she is was very friendly, they are nice here, they gave me double ranch with out charge. I got the sampler appetizer.  I like the fried zucchini the best I subsituted the jalapeno poppers for mushrooms, they didn't charge me extra 4 that either. Maybe I should have tried the poppers cause now I'm curious going to come back to try the burger next time. Food tasted better when there is a friendly server I think. I took togo. Would be nice if they served pizza here. :)"}
