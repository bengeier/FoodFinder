{"text":"Huge giant chunks of lobster?  Yes please!  My trusty sidekick and I obviously had to try both types of lobster rolls (Connecticut- served warm w/butter and lemon or Maine- served chilled w/a touch of mayo) to see which one we preferred.  While both were loaded with huge lobster pieces and both were good the Connecticut was the winner in my book.  It was a little pricey for food truck food but honestly it was loaded with so much lobster goodness I gladly forked over my money.  

I will continue to stalk where the food truck will be so I can indulge in this deluxe treat.  So glad they're in Pittsburgh now so we can have authentic and delicious lobster rolls - my latest obsession."}
{"text":"Went to the Pittsburgh Food Truck Park tonight after Mother's Day dinner just planning on having a beer with the family.  It was our 1st visit so we were checking out the options - and lo and behold - There was Cousins Maine Lobster that I've been wanting to try!  Although I was still full from dinner I got a cup of their Lobster Bisque and it was awesome!   Soooo many things on the menu that I want to try, so I'll definitely be back.  Also met one of the owners and she was super nice.  I'm definitely going back!!!"}
{"text":"After waiting in line for what seemed like a YEAR (45 mins.) I finally got to the front of this world class lobster food truck with images of cele-britties smattered throughout the sides.(it was nice)

They have lobster rolls, tacos, enchiladas, grilled cheese, bisque, whoopie pies???.... (the usual). I got the tacos.

They were fresh and good and light, you could taste each ingredient. I wish the flavor was stronger or they had choices liked herbed butter and garlic to add on.(They're descent but expensive)"}
{"text":"So I was off from work and decided to give this place a shot since I heard they would be close to my house. I pulled up and saw one of the largest lines I've ever seen. I had no idea this place had such a great reputation the line had around 30-40 people. I waited for at least an hour maybe more so I was very hungry by the time I got to order. So I just decided to get both rolls and try them out. Getting both rolls sure didn't come cheap spending $35. Both of the rolls were very good however, for the price the size of the roll I'd say either needs to bigger and more lobster or the tots come with the roll free. Because I spent $35 and I honestly was still a little hungry. I'd definitely go back and try the lobster bisque and I'd order the lobster roll again I liked both of them equally the same. I loved the fact the gave you a fresh lemon wedge too. Definitely nice to have lobster truck here in Pittsburgh as there's seafood is hard to come by."}
{"text":"Absolutely Delish!!! Now a regular follower!!  (:  totally worth the wait, just order extra! (:"}
{"text":"Wow am I on the fence about this one. Was the lobster roll fresh, meaty and delicious? It most certainly was. If you are looking for big chunks of lobster this will be your roll. If you are someone who prefers more of a lobster dip type consistency (wholey's), meaning a whole lot of mayo and smaller pieces of lobster, you will not enjoy this. 

I ordered a side of tots which was a no brainer. Tot life over everything! These tots were pretty unsatisfying. They had no flavor and were pretty soggy. I'm not sure if this was due to the fact that I didn't eat them at that very moment or if they didn't cook them enough. I had a 10 minute drive back to the office before I could chow down. For $22 I wish the roll was a little bigger to hold the meaty lobster claws. I felt like it was gone in no time, which is a good thing because that means I really liked it. 

I ended up choosing the Connecticut roll which is served warm with butter and lemon. I would definitely try the Maine roll which is served cold with mayo. Initially I was going to order the lobster tots, but I am happy I decided to go for the roll instead."}
{"text":"Growing up in NH and spending my summers in Maine, I'm pretty particular about my seafood. I must say, CML hit the nail on the head.

I went with my aunt on the grand opening in Pittsburgh. We waited 2 hours in line, but it was a nice day and the owner, Sabin, hung out and chatted with me for about 40 minutes and definitely helped pass the time. 

I got the Maine lobster roll, lobster tots and clam chowder (thanks Sabin!) and all were so good! So good that I went back a few days later to another location to get more lobster.

This time, in addition to the Maine roll and chowder, I got a lobster grilled cheese. One word: YUM!!

It is expensive, but that's the cost for delicious and fresh seafood. It reminds me of home so I'll continue to go and support this business and the owners really care about their customers and food."}
{"text":"Yum!!  I've been waiting for quality lobster in Pittsburgh.   It's a little bit of a splurge and totally worth it. I had the Maine Lobster Roll. It's cold lobster with mayo and fresh lemon, served on a buttery bread.  It was delicious. I want to try everything they have on the menu."}
{"text":"We were able to visit this truck while it was at the Millvale Food Truck Park on a busy weekend.  The line was very long but it was well worth it. The food tasted absolutely delicious and I can't wait to try them again."}
{"text":"Cousins Maine Lobster is so fresh. I have traveled to Martha's Vineyard frequently & Cousins definitely makes me feel like I'm in the upper Northeast !! Very efficient service & also awesome staff !! Hands down amazing !!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to the Food Park in Millvale tonight as a fun way of celebrating our 41st anniversary.  Despite the downpour, Cousins Maine did not disappoint.  Hands down, this was the best lobster roll I have ever had in my life.  Efficient and cheerful service, a roll lightly toasted to perfection, and the lobster?  Out-of-this-world.  My husband had the lobster quesadilla.  Our only regret was that we didn't place a double order for everything.  We will definitely seek this food truck out as often as our budget (and the food truck's location) allow!"}
{"text":"I've heard people rave about this food truck and I've never had the chance to try it. That day finally came when I learned they were going to be here for one day only at the arts fest. 

Looking at the menu I thought ok this is a little pricey but it everyone says it's amazing then it's worth it. I ended up ordering the Connecticut roll. I was sadly pretty disappointed with it. Seemed like it had little to no flavor. Just tasted like lobster between 2 slices of bread. Would be nice to have a little sauce or extra flavor of some kind. My coworkers told me the cold roll was much better so I would be willing to give it a second chance."}
{"text":"An amazing amazing experience! Loved everything I ordered and the food was gorgeous!! The service was amazing. So many smiling faces. Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Lobster rolls in Pittsburgh??  Yes!!  Connecticut roll is full of meaty lobster with a small smear of mayo on a delicious toasty roll.  Worth every penny.  Tater tots were tasty too.  The only thing I didn't enjoy was the whoopie pie - I absolutely love whoopie pies and this one was a nice size but the filling tasted metallic to me.  Wouldn't get that again."}
{"text":"Wow, wow, wow. I had heard about this truck and was so excited to finally be at an event where it. It was at the 2018 Greater Pittsburgh Food Truck festival at the Meadows Casino. The festival started at noon, we showed up at 12:10 And the line for Cousins was already very long!. Note to self, this truck is more popular than I was led to believe, show up early! After a 40+ minute wait in the hot sun I made my way to the window. They had tv's on the truck with the menu items and prices, but honestly they were very hard to see because of the sun. They also had printed photos of their items and it would have been a much better idea for them to have the prices listed on those pictures for people to see. It would also speed up the line because I could see people were taking forever to order. I was smart enough to examine the menu on my phone whole I was in line so I didn't have an issue. Another note is that they take cash or credit which is nice because their items are not cheap, $15/roll. I went with the Maine Lobster roll, their cold lobster roll version. They also have a Connecticut Roll which is served hot, lobster tots and tacos. I was so very surprised when I saw the roll, I had been anticipating this moment for quite awhile! Large, and I mean very large, hunks and claws of lobster. I loved the fact that is had his the absolute bare minimum amount of mayo and there was a little wedge of lemon to squeeze over the succulent lobster. So fresh and delicious. I was almost sad I didn't order two! Forgive my skepticism thinking that a Food truck in PA would have a good lobster roll!  I will most definitely be back for another when I see this truck at a future event. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious and well worth the wait! We will definitely be back to the truck again!!!"}
{"text":"I don't mind paying good money for lobster but this was horrible. $16 and 2 hours in line got me a 4\" hot dog bun with stringy, dry lobster. Also bought a prepackaged Whoopie pie that was no better than a little Debbie cake."}
{"text":"So fun to be able to get a real Maine Lobster roll.  When near the New England coast I always look for some of the little lobster shak's and they never disappoint.  Had the Maine Lobster roll with a nice amount of lobster on the typical buttered lobster roll.  Sooooo good!  Also had a cup of the Lobster Bisque.  The Bisque was very tasty and cheesy and just OK.  The price of the items on the menu seemed a tad high as compared to the lobster shak's I have been to.  The line was a little long but worth the wait."}
{"text":"I've had my eye on this food truck for quite some time now so when I learned it was going to be at the greater Pittsburgh food truck festival at the Meadows my husband and I headed down there.

We arrived almost 30 minutes before the festival opened and there was already a line about half a block long for this truck alone! Not counting the time we waited for the festival to open we waited approx another 25 minutes until we made it to the front window to order.

I decided to order the Connecticut hot lobster roll and my husband ordered the Maine cold lobster roll. For $15.75 a piece they each come on a New England style roll. Condiments and napkins are right outside so I would suggest that you get them before you order. They have no silverware. Gluten free options are available.

We got our food fairly fast-team is very efficient! We were able to take our food inside the lobby of the Meadows to sit down and eat it.  Mine was partially heated but tasty. It had the buttery taste to it and there were large chunks of meat. I would assume it was the butter that cooled it off.  It was a bit messy so I'm glad we took a bunch of napkins before we ordered.  I sampled my husband's Maine lobster with the lemon wedge and I found it chunky and fresh! It does comes chilled and had a touch of mayo on it. It is cooked lobster but served cold. He really enjoyed it. Both rolls included lobster claws.

This food truck is pricey but that's what I would expect to pay for lobster. It's not cheap. We decided to forgo the side of tots and whoopie pie since we wanted to get dessert elsewhere. When we returned I saw that the line had tripled!!! 

I like the fact that they will show you your order on a computer screen to confirm accuracy. Most people pay with cards because this place alone really adds up.

Not too often one finds real Maine lobster and it is a luxury dish. They have a few restaurants in other cities and we are one of the few cities to have their food trucks.

If you wish to try them out then they have a website which gives their schedule one week at a time. My suggestion is definitely to get here as early as possible because you may end up waiting over an hour to get to the front of the line. This appears to be one of most popular food trucks in the Pittsburgh area."}
{"text":"Very excited to hear about the new lobster food truck in town, we were disappointed to miss their debut at Millvale food truck park and promptly signed up with their instagram account so we could cyber stalk their next location. 

We looked forward to meeting for lunch at their location  in the strip district all week long and got there with eager anticipation. Luckily for us, they did not disappoint! We had studied their menu online beforehand so we could game plan what we would order and share. 

We ordered one cold served Maine style lobster roll, one warm served Connecticut style lobster roll and their lobster tater tots. On the way down, we stopped at a Get Go for some Iron City Light beers to accompany lunch because you need some \"bee-ah\" for your \"lobstah\" rolls. I wish they had forks for their lobster tater tots because it was pretty impossible to eat without one with all that was going on, but I managed. 

The lobster truck delivered epic Maine lobster goodness. Can't wait for my next trip."}
{"text":"I have been waiting for the CML truck to open in Pittsburgh after having eaten at the Orlando truck several times. It was ok, but frankly disappointing.  (Orlando was way better!!) Lobster was fresh and plentiful in the rolls.  The lobster tacos were mostly onion.  Service was not wonderful - the server did not apologize for dropping half an order of (cold) tater tots on my mom's head and was rude when we asked for the soup missing from our order. I know it's only their second or third week - so hopefully things can be improved.  For $68 for 3 meals they will need to step it up."}
{"text":"I dropped by on a whim and I was pleasantly surprised at how nice and friendly everyone was for being so busy! They had a line the whole time. I got the Maine roll and it was full to the top soooo good and came out looking delicious. I will absolutely be finding them again!"}
