{"text":"We were really excited to go to Shoto  this previous weekend. We had read all the reviews and we love asian fusion, so it seemed like a good fit. We are adventurous eaters and often seek out new and inventive restaurants. We love good food, and are happy to pay high prices for incredible cuisine. Sadly, this was not the case at Shoto. We left feeling as if the chefs weren't engaged in the presentation (the kitchen is open to the counter and they explain each dish as they serve it). The food was quite mediocre and there isn't one dish that we liked enough to try to replicate at home. We felt like they were trying to be a bit too \"creative\", and as a result the flavours weren't actually all that good. There were a couple of good dishes, but it definitely wasn't good enough to justify the price. It definitely won't be on our list of restaurants to return to...  Having said all that, the sommelier was quite good and shared some interesting thoughts about his wine selections with us."}
{"text":"Did the tasting menu with wine pairing in Nov 2017 and what an amazing experience! You get to sit around the kitchen (which can get a lil warm) to enjoy this unique dining experience. Their wines are exclusively imported (cant find in LCBO) and everytime they serve, the sommelier will explain in details the region/country/type of wine. The head chef Jed Smith will serve and introduce your plates once in a while, so it is neat to have a personal interaction with him and ask questions. I would give it a 5 star but my lamb was a little bit dry and overcooked. Before you leave (and if you are still hungry), dont forget to head downstairs and grab a quick bite of their cookies at Momofuku Milk Bar!"}
{"text":"Fantastic. We went there on a special occasion. A bit skeptical about all the hype, but this place certainly lived up to the expectations. Casual but very professional chefs and waiters/waitresses. Great mix of menu. Ambiance is also amazing. Sake tasting was great, too.   I took one star out... largely because of... of course... price. It's hard to compare one cuisine to another, but you expect $150-300 per person, including tax and tips. That's a lot of money for one meal (for most people). With price range, you can choose so many other five star restaurants you want to try on the next anniversary. So, I will probably go back there in 2015."}
{"text":"Went to shoto with a friend a couple times and got the wine pairing.  I'll start this post off by saying i've been to better restaurants for half the price so i do think this place is overpriced.  Seating i found to be a bit crowded. We were at the end of the bar and so there was quite a bit of foot traffic going on behind me. I found it a bit annoying that the sommelier/wine guy had to explain everything about the wine everytime he was giving it to us (but i guess thats his job). Neither of us really cared about the details/specifics of the wine we just wanted to drink.   Food was good. Actually it was great. Some of the dishes i had were superb. Was really nice to see the 3 chefs preparing parts of each dish.   I think our bill for the both of us was like 1200$, maybe a bit more/less. If you are looking for modern/experimental food this place is good. Wouldnt recommend this place unless you're a hardcore foodie though."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Toronto. We were not very impressed by the noodle bar downstairs but my wife still wanted to try shoto out. I am so glad we did. For me, the food has to be good before I start worrying about stuff like service or ambiance. This place has all 3. The flavors are amazing. Food is satisfying. Service is spot on. But what I really love about this place is that it isn't pretentious (maybe partly because this is Toronto, not Manhattan). It is upscale dining with a comfortable atmosphere. Not stuffy at all. Plus you get to watch each course assembled in front of your eyes."}
{"text":"...Now let's move onto food.  While the dinner was officially 10 courses, the amuse was long lasting and generous.  Here is what we had (just an FYI, some of these are not really official \"dish names\", just my approximation of what I was able to pick up from the chef's descriptions, so don't shoot me if I'm a little off):  Manitoba Roll A flaky, buttery pastry (like so deliciously buttery, I saw some little pea-size bits of butter still inside).  My only complaint was that the top of the bun was a bit dry and stale- these would have been much more appealing had they not been sitting long at all.  Sea Urchin with Cranberry and Almond Garnish My partner thought this was one of the top dishes of the night, but I had a hard time with the flavour profile.  The combination of a strong fish aroma with the mildly sweet cranberry jelly was a little too much of a reach for me to make.  Grilled Octopus with Tandoori Sauce and Breadcrumbs This was a nice dish. The octopus was cooked perfectly, and I liked the mild heat and sweet aroma of the Indian inspired sauce.  Celeriac Soup with Lamb Belly and Apple  this was probably one of my top dishes of the night.  The soup was creamy and luscious, but not heavy or thick.  The lamb belly, much like pork belly, offered a crispy textural contrast, but with a more deep, gamy flavour.  With all of those rich, fatty elements, that little bit of brunoise apple offered a sweet and mildly sour note.  A really well composed amuse. ...."}
{"text":"What can I say? You have to have an open mind and accepting tasting bud to try any tasting menu. However, from my one time experience, I have to say this place may be too experimental for me. By experimental, I mean I feel I paid $150 for me and another $150 for my husband, plus almost $50 taxes and another $50 calculated tips mostly for watching a \"science lab\" performance, with the result of of the experiments not always so good. The courses I had a few had similar tastes (due to the overpowering taste of horseradish) and the desserts were not impressive. True, they made everything before my eyes and it was semi-entertaining. However, I was there for mind-blowing food and they failed me. It was a decent meal but definitely did not worth the $$$$ I paid. I remember I tried one of the Momofuku's in NYC a few years ago when I was working there. I had some weird food at the bar and I still had good memory of it. I paid very little for that."}
{"text":"If you want to experience wonderful food and pleasant service, Shoto is a must.  I would recommend this to a group of friends or co-workers looking for a special treat.  One of a kind experience, so happy to have it in my city!"}
{"text":"Frankly, I am a little shocked at the first poster's great review.  Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad, but nothing blew me away either.  Overall, the food was ok.  The presentation was simpler than I've seen at other tasting menu restaurants.  It also included what will go down as one of my least favourite tasting menu items ever: a slightly salty high gluten bun made my jaws tired from chewing.   I think it was the first time I could not finish a tasting menu item ever.  Service was great."}
{"text":"Way too overpriced for what you get.  3 of the 10 dishes were ok, 1 was too salty and the rest were very good.  Food service was horrible.  Would not got back to Shoto for sure"}
{"text":"Super disappointing. Was excited to try but both service and food was underwhelming. Overpriced."}
{"text":"Service is amazing as it is friendly and cool without being snobbish. Out of the 10 or so meals (I think it turned out to be a few more) on the tasting menu only 1 was not to my taste. When they realised that the smoked beer they paired with one of the meals was wrong (or at least no to my liking) it was quickly swapped without extra cost."}
{"text":"I've eaten at the Momofuku Ko location in NYC previously and had high expectations of Shoto.  Shoto definitely doesn't disappoint and in some ways surpasses Ko!  It's simply one of the greatest dining experiences I've had with each dish being extremely well executed.  Not a single \"miss\" on the menu. Please see the pictures I've posted if you want details of each dish.  I highly recommend ordering the matching drink menu (long menu) as the pairings are really great.  The Sake is probably the smoothest I've ever had, none of the harshness I've had with any other Sake.   A few of the wines are French from Alsace, which I love and a few selections from Ontario.  All the wine pairings had that magical quality of somehow making the food & wine taste better as you switch back and for between them.  Watching the skilled chefs work is a treat for Food TV fans as well.  Seeing the precision slicing & technique inspires me to cook better at home.  Foodies will have entertainment all night!  If you have the chance, treat yourself to a the Shoto experience, it's well worth it"}
{"text":"Highly recommended - this is not an inexpensive meal but it is second-to-none. A true dining experience. Would recommend sitting at the bar to enjoy the visual preparation of the food."}
{"text":"I've done the vegetarian version of the tasting menu at Sh?t? several times.  Specifically no meat or fish.  Eggs and dairy are okay, although honestly just about everything they have ever put out for me contains neither.  Anyway after my most recent visit on December 30, I have to say Sh?t? never disappoints.  I'm endlessly amazed at how creative they get with the veg options and yet the kitchen seems very relaxed as if they made every dish they put in front of me a thousand times before.  This is easily the best vegetarian food in the city, end of.  And my wife (whose only dietary restriction is pork) certainly has never complained about her meals there either.  The service is always friendly and attentive.  I especially like Jed Smith.  He remembered us and welcomed us back as we were being seated, which is always a nice touch.  This is a very general review I realize and I'll stop the gushing there.  But I do love this place."}
{"text":"Service was exceptional. 10 courses and at least 2 amuse bouches. 8-9 of the courses were out of this world, and the rest were above average. A delicious experience."}
{"text":"Shoto was lovely. We enjoyed an anniversary dinner in November and had the tasting menu. Everything was very well considered - the waiter was just the right amount of informative without being intrusive or too explainy; the food was very lovely as well as the pairings. We appreciated being able to see the chefs take care of everyone. Like watching an orchestra. Suggest trying a cocktail at the bar above noodle bar first."}
{"text":"Amazing food except the 12 courses was way too much for me and I actually had to go to the bathroom 3/4 through the meal because my stomach was so upset!"}
{"text":"By far my fav resto in toronto. A bit of a splurge but well worth it for the food quality, attention to detail, superb service and great cocktails. I've had the 10 course taster and the 5-6 course, we prefer the 10 course better because it felt more of a complete presentation over the latter. $200 pp of you include drinks and tips.  You get a different menu each time you go so it is also fun trying to guess the dishes.  If you chat with the waiter or the bar manager Chris, they will mix a specialty drink for you and if you don't like it, send it back.   Go and enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is an excellent dining experience. The fun part is the hipster staff and chefs. They make good food accessible and help you understand what you are eating. We've been here a few times and it does seem to get repetitive which is why i didn't go with 5 stars but if you've never been, you'll seriously be impressed. If you're lucky enough to try to rice cube cooked in bacon fat....swwooon!"}
{"text":"Holy moly sodium! The first half of my entree was quite exceptional and then as I progressed it just got way too salty.  This swanky spot is located within the Shangri-la hotel, and whoever designed it has impeccable taste. It's just the right kind of ambiance for an intimate dinner for two or a large group.  I will give the food another chance, so please don't disappoint Momofuku!"}
{"text":"I had dinner there this past Friday with a friend visiting from Vancouver who was celebrating his birthday. I would say that much of the food and experience was good but not great. Given the high expectations I had from previous fabulous experiences at Noodle Bar and the fact that the Globe called this the best restaurant in Toronto, I was actually quite disappointed.   Our server did an ok job, but overall I felt like we were slightly rushed through our meal. Some of the courses were quite delicious but the portions are really small. We opted for the pairing of courses with wine and beer. This was a bad choice. We received thimble-sized portions of these beverages. Also, the selections tended to be from places like Sicily and Niagara, rather than Bordeaux.   The chefs who served our morsels were unfriendly to the point of surly.   My friend snapped a picture of me and then was chastised for taking a photo that might show the kitchen. Given that the kitchen is in the centre of the dining area, that was kind of strange.  My friend's birthday which I had mentioned to the server at the outset was not acknowledged in any way.  The seating is not particularly comfortable.  I would never go back here. The hefty price tage does not reflect the quality of the experience."}
{"text":"$500 for an 8 course tasting with pairings.... I expect it to be tastebud-blowing.  Not so.  The first 3 courses were forgettable.  It picked up from there, and the pairings were decent but the tasting/pairing at Buca (King) is almost half the price and 9 out of 10 dishes were a smash hit.  We enjoyed the evening. Service was great but I can definitely think of better ways to spend $500+tip."}
{"text":"Thank you to my dear, dear boyfriend for taking me out to Shoto for my birthday! The experience is certainly different than your average dining fete; One that I think you should try at least once (or if you have the dollas, more than once...)  Pre-Shoto.  Making the reservation was fairly easy. My boyfriend left a message describing date and time, and someone returned his call. He wasn't able to take the call right then, but the person said he could either call back or make the reservation online. He made it online and boy, the email confirmation we received was intense! You couldn't be late more than 15 minutes, and if you were late, you had to notify the restaurant. If not, you would be charged $150 per person! You had to notify the restaurant a day in advance if you couldn't make it, otherwise, another charge. If you didn't show up at all, you forfeit your spot and get a charge... My boyfriend and I made sure we were at the restaurant 15 minutes prior to our 6pm reservation!  Shoto.  This restaurant is in the Shang and you have to take an elevator to the third floor, where there are two restaurants. We were the first ones to arrive and we got a prime seat of the kitchen (right in the middle). It's open concept so you can see all the chefs working: making sauces, cutting apples, shucking oysters, etc...  My boyfriend and I opted for the wine pairing, and just a word of advice, the drinks go by pretty fast. The pace of the menu is fairly quick and you get a pairing with each of your 10 courses so if you did want to slow down the pace of your booze intake, you can just order a bottle of wine (or glass) and drink at your leisure. I have to say thought that the booze pairings really enhanced the flavour of the dishes, so if you're up for it, I would recommend the pairing ($80 extra) - choices are a variety of reds, whites, a beer from Copenhagen and Sake.  The food, in my opinion, was good, but not anything outstanding. My faves were the Fluke and Quiche with caviar (yummmmmm). Second honors went to the Cavatelli and Elk.  Service is very fluid and smooth. Dishes are promptly cleared and water always filled. What occurs is the cooks and chefs serve you the dishes and provide an explanation. There is someone else that pours the booze and gives you explanations on that. The chefs encourage you to ask lots of questions, but it seems like their answers are very rushed. No surprise there as they have to serve everyone else, plus prepare the food.  On that note, my boyfriend and I got the 6pm reservation which I think is the better time slot. Our meal finished at 8:30, which means if you get a reservation at 8, you will most likely finish at 10:30 (for those of you who don't mind eating late). Prepare for at least 2.5 hours to the dinner. As mentioned, once you finish your dish, it is promptly wisked away, and you are served the next plate. I couldn't really have a relaxing conversation with my boyfriend, but maybe this is not the environment for that anyways.  Overall, total damage for two people, including wine pairing and two cocktails pre-dinner, came out to be $550. This is before tip. Needless to say, this was a very, very, expensive dinner.   Now the $550 question - was it worth it? Considering it was for my birthday, and my boyfriend had planned it, and we had a great time just him and I - Yes. Having said that, would I go again? Probably not for \"just a dinner\". Notwithstanding that the menu changes based on the season, a dinner at Shoto is more a \"theater-experience\" rather than just a place you go to for good grub.   But I would still recommend people to try Shoto, at least once. It is something different and unique and for special occasions, definitely."}
{"text":"It was a bit of a roller coaster, up and down. The seafoods were well executed, and their natural freshness and sweetness was allowed to shine. However, many of the more flavourful sauces (eg. in the pudding, the sauce of the mushrooms in the chawanmushi) overpowered some of the dishes. From a food perspective, I give them a 7/10 because I did expect more.  From the service side of things, I have no complaints. When I wanted to know a little more about the fresh yuzu that was being zested over the fish, the chef serving us was happy to explain. Our  server never hovered, yet still managed to be attentive; regularly refilling our water glasses, changing our cutlery, and checking in on our drink orders as necessary. We were never rushed after paying the bill, yet somehow as soon as I was ready to leave, he was standing there with my jacket. 9/10 for service and ambiance."}
{"text":"Reservation - For us, easy to get, with a lot of times available. The online reservation system makes it a breeze. However, the reservation policy is quite scary! Late 15 minutes, you are considered a no-show and will be charged $150 per person, the price of the 10 course tasting menu.   Setting - Anyone who has been to Momofuku in Toronto knows how gorgeous this restaurant is. The concept at Shoto definitely did not disappoint. A beautiful bar around an amazing kitchen. Front row seats to the action. It made us excited even before we started eating.   Service - A+. 100% top notch. From the hostess, to the bartender, to our server and even the bussers, everyone was friendly and efficient. Our server very honestly told us that the $95 menu would hit all the high points, so unless we wanted those little in-between courses, going for the $95 would be the better way to explore Shoto. We really appreciated this recommendation. Since we are from out of town, our server even took the time to write down other restaurant/bar recommendations to check out during our stay.   Food - This is where I have to take off some stars. While the concept is great, we didn't find the food mind-blowingly fantastic, which is what we expect of a place that charges Shoto prices. Everything was just \"ok\" tasting, but nothing tasted innovative or new. While we were content, not a single course wowed. Even in terms of presentation, there is very minimal plating, garnish, etc. Also, all these Yelp reviews that mention small portions - this is TRUE! Portions were so minuscule that we actually started laughing by the 2nd course, knowing we had 5 course, because we were thinking \"We'll get 3 more courses like this... we'll be starving.\" We actually went to DaiLo after this to \"complete\" our meal.   TL;DR - Beautiful restaurant, great concept, amazing service. Tiny, expensive portions that'll leave you wanting more. Probably won't come back, but will recommend as an experience to try for others."}
{"text":"Well damn. Came here twice during a 4 night stay in Toronto and would have eaten here every day if I could.  Can we start the oysters? Let's start with the oysters. To be honest I'm not an oyster fan but after tasting the giant seafood platter here I have seen the light. The secret is the source. These are east coast oysters- no strong ocean-y smell, no weird consistency. They were perfect. PERFECT I say!!  Because my group of friends are conveniently also the biggest foodies I have ever met, we also family-styled a giant sirloin steak which did not let us down.   Also ordered were a jar of kimchi, the buttermilk biscuits with chili honey (OMGGGG), brussel sprouts, and flavored green beans. All so good.  We asked for refills of the complimentary cucumbers too. Seriously is anything here less than amazing??"}
{"text":"***Momofuku Shoto utilizes Ontario seafood, fruits and vegetables to produce high-end Asian cuisine that reminds me of SF's Benu***  I typically stick to local options when traveling, but I made an exception for Momofuku Shoto.  The food looked too good and the ability to take food photos was a draw given that NY's Momofuku Ko (David Chang's flagship restaurant) forbids it.  I was happy to find out, after visiting both Momofuku Shoto and Daisho in Toronto, that Chang's restaurants here integrate a lot of local ingredients and farms.  Shoto takes the minibar by Jose Andres setup by placing guests directly in the kitchen so that guests can watch chefs plate and interact with them to learn more about the dinner's ingredients and preparations.  This style is becoming more popular (NY's Atera is also doing this) and it makes sense given how popular culinary is right now.  The menu at Shoto is a contemporary Asian tasting menu--a mix of Western, Japanese and Chinese ingredients and techniques.  The menu started with a series of very good amuses.  Up first was a raw oyster topped with a spicy pepperoncini sauce.  This was followed by lamb tartare on toast with sesame seeds and balsamic.  Creamy zucchini custard topped with a mix of razor clams and tomato followed.  The final amuse was an earthy chanterelle soup with a garnish of perfectly fried and amazingly tender duck tongue.  The first course was very soft and moist raw diver scallop dressed with big chunks of strong lemongrass and a refreshing celery jus (fun use of poppy seed too).  Really good Spanish mackerel followed--pickled but not too strong.  The crudo was garnished with fennel and spicy green chile.  One of the best courses came next, which was warm daikon soup garnished with crisp radishes, grilled local trout and roe, and crunchy almond slivers.  The roe exploded with juiciness while the trout was exceptional.  It had a crisp skin while the flesh was moist, soft and perfectly flaky.  I also enjoyed the soup, which was warm and hearty like a potato soup but also light.  Another excellent course came next, which perfectly combined Western, Japanese and Chinese cuisines.  The core ingredient was a perfectly moist, fluffy and not too sweet tamago.  The tamago was topped with a savory fermented black bean (it also had a light salty punch).  The tamago was garnished with fresh greens and moist and tender poached lobster.  The next course was pan fried gyoza topped with shaved albacore tuna.  I enjoyed the crust on the gyoza.  It had a crispy layer that exceeded the width of the dumplings (kind of like when you grill shredded cheese in a pan).  The shaved tuna was also great (similar to bonito).  The tuna was smoked and then finely shaved over top of the dumplings.  The problem with these types of courses though is that the kitchen needs to use a premium filling in its entirety like foie gras to stand out.  The veal was grounded up too much (it ended up tasting like ground pork).  My favorite course followed.  It was steamed halibut topped with XO sauce, julienne scallions and corn tempura.  The XO sauce was great--hearty with a salty, savory and spicy kick like really good chorizo.  It was lightened up by scallions and there was enough of the moist halibut to keep the XO sauce from overpowering everything.  The corn tempura was really fun as it delivered the light crispy crunch of great tempura but also a sweeter than usual tempura filling.  Next up was fried green tomato with shaved goat's milk gouda, greens and chicken liver mousse.  Really nicely cooked pork rib followed.  The fat had been reduced down enough and the meat was juicy and tender.  The pork rib was glazed in a plum and maple sauce and served with grilled little gem lettuce.  Dessert was served in two courses--both light.  First up was really good kiwi sorbet over fresh ricotta cheese while the second course consisted of strawberry sorbet, fresh strawberries, milk foam, green tea mousse, and really good shortbread.  Service was excellent.  The servers were very professional, polished and personable.  The chefs were also nice and would entertain questions from guests.  The food came out at a good pace though the timing between courses got a little more elongated as the restaurant filled up.  Prices are high though Shoto is a very unique experience and the restaurant serves a great variety of ingredients and preparations.  Momofuku Shoto tastes like it could be in SF, NY or Chicago, but it also integrates ingredients local to the area.  It takes the high standards and finesse of its NY origin as well as local Toronto product to deliver a dining experience that can compete with America's best while also feeling very unique to the area.  I do not know what the parking situation is."}
{"text":"Good, but way overrated.  Comparing this experience against other izakayas as well as Sushi Kaji for omokase, the value just isn't there.  It's not bad, but for $150 per person, we wouldn't go back, and neither would my family."}
{"text":"Redonk -but we already knew that, didn't we? Always mouth watering delicious yummy yum yum- one of the best in the world"}
{"text":"Fantastic 10 course tasting. Lots of cool and interesting dishes. Was awesome being able to see the kitchen work. Service was top notch.   Only docked it one star because by the end of the 5th or 6th course we were starving and for the price. I get portion size has to be small in a 10 course situation but when your customer is sitting there thinking FEED ME, loading it a little heavier to the front end may not be a bad idea. Also for $150 per person before drinks, there are cheaper better options available.  That being said we left full, satisfied, and with some great memorable dishes to think and talk about. I probably would not return unless is was to one of the other places in Momofuku but the experience was great and I am happy I did it."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience at Shoto. Food was great, excellent wine / beer menu and fantastic service. The kitchen is completely open and you sit \"bar style\" surrounding the kitchen watching everything made in front of you - this approach really adds to the overall experience.  The tasting menu is $150 a person. Is it worth it? I guess that will be a personal choice. For me, the overall experience was worth it, but two of my four dinning friends didn't think so. All liked the food, it came down to the price ($1,300 for 4 people with drinks, tax and tip). The menu is really unique so I think you should try at least once and judge for yourself.   They have a wine pairing option for $80 / person. Two people in my party ordered this option. You get 8 samples with your meal -served with most courses. Both guys were feeling \"pretty good\" by the end. The wine selections come quickly so your forced to drink quick or waste it. My friends didn't waste it but were \"feeling good\" by the end. I would recommend skipping this option unless your a speed drinker. Just order the wine separately and drink at your own pace.  To my surprise, they have an excellent beer menu with multiple craft beers on tap. I went with a few selections from Beau's. They will tell you what beers are best for each course.     Service is spectacular. Your plates and cutlery are changed with every course, drinks are refilled immediately and staff were incredibly friendly.   I'm not one for super long reviews but I thought I would share the menu - as menus are not available online. The first time you see the menu is when you finish dinner! They give you a copy to take home.  It was a little frustrating doing research without menus.   This was the tasting menu served on April 25, 2013 (pictures attached):  - Starts with 4-5 Amuse courses - 1)Rice with pork fat, 2)spicy soup, 3) lamb, 4) some kind of meatball and 5) sea urchin.  10 course menu begins:  - Snapper with black bean, cherry bomb and myoga (whatever that is?)  Nice light sashimi style - good starting choice, not too heavy.  - Dry aged rib with green peppercorn, caviar and bacon. This was delicious. A razor thin cut of raw beef with flavour treats stuffed inside. They recommend rolling it into a roll when you eat it. You can really taste the peppercorn and caviar.  - Goose Wonton brussels sprouts and shitake mushrooms - The dumplings are matched well with a strong broth.  I loved the shredded sprouts, eat them with the dumplings for full effect.  - Pea Custard with pickled egg, goat butter and trout roe. This was a complete miss for me, I didn't like it at all. The pea custard and goat butter dominates the dish, too overpowering.  - Tortellini with chicken liver, morel and fava beans. This was one of the best dishes of the night, so rich. The liver was stuffed inside three perfectly cooked tortellini noodles.  - Trout with tomatillo, almond and jalapeno. Another stand out. They pour an almond sauce on the trout in front of you. Excellent.  - Pig Face with pea shoots, ginger and chinese celery. I guess any part of the pig is good! This dish had parts of the pig face cooked in different styles - deep fried, raw and boiled. All came together perfectly in the end.  - Venison, cauliflower and lentl. The Venison was cooked perfectly and served with a cranberry reduction. Also very good.  - Apple sorbet to cleanse the pallet  - Pineapple with licorice and graham cracker. A great way to finish a meal.       Give it a try....  BK"}
{"text":"impeccably prepared food, Iron-Chef quality presentation.  Nothing too surprising but worth a visit.  Experience was dampened by a person sitting next to me (apparently a visiting chef known to the staff) hitting on me. Here's what i had:  a few amuses, then spanish mackerel (a bit dry compared to the aji one might get at a sushi bar), dry aged rib carpaccio (very tasty), octopus (ok), pea custard w/ trout roe (nice variation on chawanmushi), chicken liver tortellini (very good), poached trout (outstanding), pig face salad (very nice), stuffed chicken (a bit salty for me but otherwise excellent), cucumber ice w/ juniper sorbet (refreshing), another dessert w/ pineapple"}
{"text":"If you have a good chunk of change and enjoy tasting menus, this is the place to do it.  I've eaten at the noodle bar and daisho several times and Shoto is worlds better in terms of creativity, flavours and presentation.  Sitting at the bar gets pretty hot so wear a t-shirt unless you like sweating, but the service is very intimate and if you do the wine pairing you'll get an excellent range of reds, white, sake and beer.  Highlight of my tasting menu was undoubtedly the lobster, sea urchin and scallop soup which comes about half way into the experience.  Extremely rich and melty.  Sidenote: the bread and sweet butter was also surprisingly addictive and keeps you full.  Speaking of full, this dinner will fill you up.  I had to undo my top button about half way in.  I could not move by the end, in a good way.  You will spend a lot, but I'd recommend the wine pairing with the meal ($85).  I also opted for the caviar which comes on a scalloped potato type pie.  For $40 each, you could go without unless you're craving caviar.  I walked out spending more than I've ever spent on a meal for two people, but for a special occasion it is worth it... of if you're rich (not me).  I've heard Alo is comparable, but have yet to try."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had been to Daisho and the noodle bar before in Toronto's Momofuku location, and he'd been to the New York locations while living in that city. We were naturally very excited to try Shoto. It has a considerably different atmosphere than the rest of the restaurant, featuring decor which could become quickly dated in the near future, but the centrepiece of the stainless steel-clad kitchen and vast quantity and variety of utensils and equipment is truly a magnificent feature.  The ten course tasting menu is phenomenal. I won't provide many spoilers for those attending in the near future, because half the fun is being surprised. I will say that the chawanmushi dish was our favourite, hands down, and that the duck course could have easily been halved or quartered in portion size and would have still been quite filling. We also agreed that the cavatelli was delightful enough to be served as a main at another crowd-pleaser, Enoteca Sociale. Peering into the nooks and crannies of the open kitchen and watching the unbelievably talented chefs as they orchestrate culinary harmonies is riveting. RIVETING.   As a couple, we try a vast amount of interesting restaurants. No matter where we go, we consistently are seated next to an individual, couple, or group of people who are just the worst. Shoto was no exception, as the woman seated next to me refused to eat butter. The concerned chef inquired: was she lactose intolerant or allergic? Many of our dishes include butter, he stated. It wasn't featured prominently enough for anyone to notice, he explained -- to no avail. My dining partner said if this was an NYC location, she wouldn't have been appeased as she was in the Toronto location, as she was served dishes from the Daisho menu as substitutes.   If you have dietary restrictions for whatever reason, that's one thing. Attending a meal with a ten-course tasting menu and then declaring rudely and pompously that one does not eat butter, making a huge fuss over it is another thing. She didn't say she didn't LIKE butter; she simply did not want to consume it. I sincerely hope her diminutive Chanel clutch was large enough to accommodate whatever she had up her ass."}
{"text":"If you're looking for an experience similar to Ko, don't get your hopes up. But it's not bad given what Toronto has to offer."}
{"text":"They serve a tasting menu and it's excellent. 4.5/5 good. I found the service adequate but not excellent. 3.5/5.  First, when we booked and also when the restaurant called to confirm we were told it was a 10 course tasting menu. However, when we arrived they said it was an 8 course menu. It's not a major issue and wouldn't have stopped us from going but you should let your guests know of this of change. There was no change in the price ($120 per person) - just 2 fewer dishes.  We had an early reservation (6:30 pm) so the dining area was quite empty but it quickly filled up. The seating surrounds the kitchen so you can see what is going on. There was one main chef serving who was quite friendly. However, the other chefs just served the food and described the dishes. They weren't rude, though.  There were 2 servers who served drinks and and changed the dishes along with a bus person. Their  service could have been better - we had to pour our own wine (most other places keep your glass full all the time) and the servers were not always around when we wanted to ask them for something. Frankly, I think they should have a smaller number of guests.  Alo's chef table only seats 6 diners and there is always  someone there.  The food on the tasting menu was very good. Each dish was tasty and well presented. The crab and pork rib dishes were standouts. They had a foie gras special. I don't like foie gras that much be my guest had it so I had it too (extra $20 each) . It was not good. The one other thing is that the sardine dish tasted a little bit fishy - I frequently have sardines and usually there is no fishy taste.  We a had bottle of red wine and cocktails.  Drinks were and pretty cheap given the restaurant.   Bill came out to $480 with tax and tip for 2 people."}
{"text":"Ive been to both the 95$ shoto tasting menu and the 150$ one. If you can go for either, take the larger option, since you are already dropping this kind of money so you might as well go all out. Also make sure you go very hungry. Expect to say 2-2.5 hours.  I think one of the best things about this experience is that you are trying so many different things, and all of it is going to be extremely fresh and extremely high quality. If you haven't had a chance to try types of food that are not served at more generic restaurants, then this is for you. In one night you are going to try a whole lot of different things, but they are all made in ways that are very accessible.  You have to also remember that part of what you are paying for is the fact that you are sitting right in front of the chefs, which is why I describe this meal as an experience... Its not a normal restaurant in that way.  I would also recommend talking to the people working there because they can give you ideas on what to pair your food with, as they have a very extensive drink menu, and much more that are unlisted.   The menu is always changing but my favorite tonight was either the scallop with morels, or the dessert that was a maple ice cream. Least fav was the beef tongue, but for me its a texture thing.  Anyway, if you decide to go you'll have a lot of fun. First time I went, Murdoch, from Murdoch mysteries was dining down the table from us, cool stuff!"}
{"text":"My husband brought me here for my birthday and it's probably one of the best meals I've ever had in Toronto. The meal started out strong and it got progressively better! The only thing we didn't like were their cocktails. All in all a fantastic meal and experience."}
{"text":"Had drinks here and the atmosphere is hip. Price point is high though and service was great!"}
{"text":"Birthday celebration brought us to Shoto.  The service is incredibly attentive from start to finish, including the rapport the chefs have when explaining each course to you.    It's an intimate setting with only 20 some odd seats arranged around the chefs station and we had a nice chat with the couple next to us.    There were several amuse bouche before the actual courses.  That magical bun was such a light fluffy but crispy pillowy mouthful of heaven.  All the courses were executed well and the flavours were amazing.  They give you a card with all the courses listed to take home with you. I assume this allows me to read it and drool all over it until I go again.  Definitely worth spoiling yourself every so often!"}
{"text":"Somehow, I've never made it to Momofuku Noodle Bar in New York, so when I saw a branch would be opening in Toronto while I'd be there, I knew I'd finally get inside a David Chang restaurant. But I decided that before heading to the Noodle Bar for lunch, I'd see whether I could get reservations for the evening tasting menu at Momofuku Shoto.  I was able to do so, which required diligence, though nothing like the obsessive/compulsive checking of the Internet that was required to get into Alinea and Next. To book seats at the U-shaped Shoto counter means logging on to the Momofuku site at exactly 10:00 a.m. 13 days before the date you're seeking. So at 9:59 a.m. on Sunday, October 21st, I was hitting refresh, refresh, fresh until the site allowed me to book seats for Saturday, November 3rd.  Which was a relief, because I wanted to see Momofuku while it was all shiny and new, with excitement still in the air about a new adventure just begun.  My friends and I experienced an amazing meal, but what's most alive in my memory isn't just the food (which I expected), but a strange encounter in the Men's room (which I did not). But I'll get to the urinals conversation in a bit. First, the food.  I'm not going to recap every dish, because there wasn't a single one that disappointed, and I'm sure you can discover complete info elsewhere if that's what you're looking for. So let me just tell you about my three favorites.  The goose wonton with Brussels sprout and shitake tasted ... well ... they had me at goose. I didn't use the chopsticks, instead simply lifting the bowl and slurping the wonton down. Its flavor caressed my tongue, its warmth radiated through me, and I was at peace.  The spaghetti with nori, sardine, and lumpfish roe had me thinking ... how can I ever eat spaghetti in my own home again? All other pasta would pale. The sardine was wonderfully salty, and all the flavors were in harmony.  But the star of the evening--which had me seeing God--was the 36-hour sous vide veal cheek, the final pre-dessert course, which sort of snuck up on us. We'd noted a bubbling tank at the far end of the kitchen, realized something was being cooked in its warm waters, but had no idea what until our plates were placed before us. I ate it slowly, not wanting the food orgasm--complete with goosebumps--to end.  Desserts followed, but as far as I was concerned, that veal cheek was the true dessert.  But what (I'm sure you're thinking) about the aforementioned conversation at the urinals?  Well ...  Midway through the meal, I headed to the Men's room, and as I was standing by the far right urinal, I heard a deep voice ask, \"So what do you think?\"  I looked over, and at the far left urinal was a beefy guy, taller than me, looking in my direction.  \"I'm enjoying it,\" I said.  \"I'm kinda disappointed,\" said he.  \"Oh, really? Why?\"  He shrugged.  \"Eh ... I'm just disappointed.\" He then went on to say that he'd already eaten at Shoto twice, and he was only going to give it one more chance. (Which, at $150 per tasting menu, is mighty generous for a restaurant that disappoints you.)  As we washed our hands, I tried to get him to explain exactly what was so disappointing, and he'd only say that he was in the business and had opened many restaurants himself, but I was unable to get much out of him other than that he preferred the way Thomas Keller did things. Which puzzled me until I later discussed it with my friends, who felt what he was trying to say was that he didn't like the pulsating rock and roll energy of a David Chang kitchen, preferring the quiet, contemplative atmosphere of a Keller kitchen instead. (But in the absence of details, we couldn't be sure.)  I mentioned that I'd recently been to Alinea and Next, figuring that if he saw the level of foodie I was, I might get some specifics out of him, but what he said next was his strangest statement of all.  In a blase voice, showing about as little enthusiasm as it's possible for a voice to show, he responded, \"Alinea is okay.\"  He might as well have just said, \"Meh.\"  Alinea ... which was just given a 3-star Michelin rating for the third year in a row ... only okay?  Who was this guy?  He'd said he'd been responsible for opening many restaurants in the past and was about to open more, so I asked his name, telling him I wanted to track down his work so I could get a better idea of how he thought a restaurant ought to be run. But he'd only tell me his first name.  Max.  I got the feeling the guy realized he'd said too much, so I wasn't even sure his name was really Max. (Anyone out there know a tall guy named Max in the restaurant biz in Chicago?) Regardless, the encounter sure added a strange twist to the evening.  Because if Momofuku Shoto is \"disappointing\" and Alinea is only \"okay,\" what kind of chef are you, really? (Other than a very bored chef, I guess.)  Alinea is far more than \"okay.\" And Momofuku Shoto was far more than \"disappointing.\"  Trust me on this."}
{"text":"This is not the easiest restaurant for me to rate as I have such mixed feelings about my dining experience. First off in terms of service, ambiance, creativity and novelty, I give this place the highest of marks.  Let us get to the food though and this is where things got awfully conflicting for me. With almost all restaurants that experiment, there is always a risk that you might have a few misses along with hopefully many hits. That is understandable but those misses hurt that much more when you are paying a few hundred dollars for two (my wife joined me on this culinary adventure).   Now mind you I am very new to yelp and I am digging into the recesses of my mind to recall my meal here from some time ago. However, that does demonstrate that these dishes were quite memorable to me.   First, I would almost go back simply for a cube of rice that tasted like it must have been dipped in ambrosia (likely pork fat, so pretty close). By contrast, I had one of my least favourite dishes of food of the last few years here as well. That being what the chef referred to as lamb chow-chow. Think lamb tartare. On second thought, if your tastes are anything like mine, probably best not to.    The rest of the meal was above average from the mains of seafood and protein to the dessert, so all in all, it was a good meal.   If you are going to take anything from this review, be it this: It's a nice expensive restaurant that serves a lot of foods in many different preparations. You are bound to try something you love but if there are any foods you do not like, do not be shocked to get it here either. For me it was raw lamb and a dish that used a lot of celery. Would I eat such dishes again to get to the aforementioned cube of rice? Sadly, that is a question I continue to ask myself."}
{"text":"A fine dining EXPERIENCE! The \"experience\" part has to be highlighted because you literally watch the chefs prepare the food right in front of your eyes! My boyfriend took me here to celebrate my 30th birthday. A delightful surprise indeed!  He booked reservations two weeks in advance because there is limited- seating for this. You sit at a bar type style table, side by side one another so that you can watch the chefs cook. I loved the attention to detail. The moment we got there, we were served a starter app. The 10 dishes were nicely timed and we actually both left full. The food was really good. They use different types of food, spices, and sauces for each dish and the parings of flavours were amazing. Presentation and plating was also very pleasing to the eye.  This is definitely a place to go for a special occasion and if you want to enjoy a different type of dining experience. Compared to George, I still like this better because you can watch the chefs cook and ask them questions. The food quality and cost between George and shoto are the same in my opinion."}
{"text":"By far one of my favorite eating experiences - one mouth watering bite after another, each a piece of art to devour. Great for a special occasion! Fun to watch the chefs do their work. I know it's expensive, but if you have money and love food - go!"}
{"text":"I am honored to pen the first review of Shoto...an absolutely unmatched culinary experience in Toronto.   Fresh from our dining extravaganza, I can only provide these sage words of advice:  \"Go. Partake. Indulge. Deny yourself nothing.\"  Masterful execution of an exciting concept. I cannot wait to return!!"}
{"text":"Won't be here again!  It's my daughter's birthday and 3 of us were at Diasho for lunch.  It certainly was busy because we were put on a table sharing with another party of 2.  I asked the girl to give us a separate table since there were some 4 people table vacant, and I told her its my daughter's birthday.  She insisted those tables are for \"bigger party\".  So we seated. My daughter was not happy and said she felt not respected as a special one celebrating birthday.  So when the waiter came I told him that my daughter's not happy to be treated this way, why not put us 3 on the table for 4?  He explained that's their norm to let clients share table, and walked away without doing anything.  At this moment we almost want to leave but we were hungry and didn't want to walk out in the cold to find a random place to eat.  So we finished our lunch with the 2 strangers talking loud beside us and none of us was in good mood as you can imagine.  The tables for 4 was occupied by 2 ladies shortly after, another one was given to a party of 3.  So why not satisfy my daughter who was having birthday which comes only once in a year and make her birthday lunch not so miserable.  She's so low that I felt almost awkward to give her birthday gift at the end of the meal.  Well, I think I am going to book another meal to make up for this.  I am so sorry to bring my little one into this cold glass and steel restaurant.  I will definitely not come back!!"}
{"text":"My meal the evening of 3/16/2013 was simply exquisite. I cannot say it was the greatest meal of my life, but I truly cannot think of one that was better.  The price tag is certainly hefty: add in the exorbitant Ontario taxes and dinner for two with wine pairings exceeds $500 before tip, but if you know that ahead of time and have already numbed yourself to the pain, you can really settle in for a memorable experience.  The evening of our dinner featured five (5) amuses prior to our courses starting and two of them were so amazing as to deserve larger formats on the tasting menu (which is the only option at Shoto).   I would love to go on at length with regard to each dish we had, but as the menu changes regularly, there is little likelihood you'll experience the same.  The highest compliment I can pay, other than the five stars above, was actually quipped by by bride: \"I have always wanted to go to a dinner like this.\"  I am so glad we did."}
{"text":"Pretty good, but for the price I've had better. Ordered a multi course special but I will eat from the main menu next time."}
{"text":"This was the most expensive meal i've had to date and I'm not sure exactly how I feel about it. On the one hand, the presentation was beautiful, the taste was mostly good (although it ranged from 'interesting' to 'tasteless' to 'delicious'), and the ambiance was nice and intimate, but on the other hand, there were some plates that were a miss, and it seemed like the chefs preparing the food were simply placing the items together, not really tasting them but just following a 'recipe'. If they had taste it (which I did not see any of them do), they would have realized a couple of the dishes were really bland and needed seasoning.   Anyways, it was a fun experience and I had a good time but I don't feel like it's worth the value."}
{"text":"Unbelievably great!  Innovative food, with great knowledgeable service, while the pixies play in the background. My kind of place!  If only it wasn't so expensive; I guess it's for spacial occasions only.   But worth the money in my option."}
{"text":"I am a fan of the momofuku chain and it's location. It's within walking distance to where to live and it serves Asian fusion cuisine, what more can I ask for !!!  You literally sit in a bar like setup and watch the chefs do their culinary tricks. The service was a bit slow for my liking and it gets uncomfortable especially towards the end of a 3 hour meal. The chefs have limited space hence they prepare the dishes in batches. It's sort of frustrating if you are not in the first few batches.  The meal starts with a couple of amuse bouches.  + Their bread is rich and fatty but delectable. You can simply eat it by itself without any butter or olive oil.  + scallop with mushroom and artichoke was my favorite course. Beautifully seared scallop with the earthiness of mushrooms and black truffle aroma.  + spaghetti with olives and charred octopus was a simple preparation but so damn tasty !!  + lamb Consommé was comfort food elevated to the next level  - I don't quite understand why we cannot order cocktails from Nikai (on the second floor). We were informed that it is a separate entity and instead the only option we had was to order from their rather limited cocktail menu. I loved the cocktails at Nikai but I was highly disappointed with the bourbon rosemary julep that was offered to me here. I had them change the drink and the second iteration was way better - Paper plane!  - The brisket was a huge portion. Although it was comforting subsequent bites got heavy and the unnecessary greens as garnish was frankly quite annoying.  Menus change completely every 3-4 weeks, so it's worth a shot any time of the year depending upon what's in season. I must admit that at 150 CAD per person all this comes at a steep price. If you add on wine pairings, you will have dented a big hole in your pocket. For me, it was a unique experience with a tasting of asian fusion cuisine which is not something you can get everywhere."}
{"text":"Dinner at Shoto was the main reason for my trip to Toronto, and my most anticipated dinner of 2014; the meal exceeded my hopes.   As a regular patron of Momofuku Ko in NYC for the past six years, I've been fortunate to have had Chef Mitch Bates cook many of my meals, so I wanted to see what he was doing at Shoto and whether there would be similarities with Ko.   Very pleased to report that Chef Bates cuisine is not a clone of the cuisine at Ko, but is creative and delicious and different from Ko.   Shoto is a larger and more elegant version of Ko with almost twice as many seats. The only similarities with Ko are that there are 10 courses with 2 of them as desserts. For anyone who has been to Ko and believes that it would be the same at Shoto, you would be making a mistake.   Additional visits to Shoto will keep me returning to Toronto.   Service was very friendly and attentive.   The following is my menu on 5/28:  Amuses: 5 of them (didn't take notes since I knew that I would be receiving a printed menu at the end of the dinner, but didn't realize the amuses wouldn't be listed). I do recall the oyster, and the lamb tartare. They were larger in portion size than at Ko.   Scallop, celery, water chestnut, poppyseed;  Spot prawn, tamarind, pig ear, cabbage;  Dungeness crab, asparagus, kimchi, yuba;  Fried duck egg, Thai chili, crushed rice, herbs;  Alkaline noodles, clam, octopus, kombu;  Skate, pea, ramp, spring allium;  Morel, foie gras, duck tongue, rhubarb;  Chicken, seaweed, spring allium, cattail,  Coconut-ginger, black tea, honey, bee pollen;  Hootenanny, maple, orange.   Toronto is so lucky to have Shoto!"}
{"text":"Shoto chefs provide a multi-course tasting menu that features the diversity of Ontario's fresh ingredients. The amazing thing about this restaurant is that it is a bar table all around, with the show being the Shoto chefs in action! You can watch them prepare the meals right in front of you. It's like a show in itself for all you foodies out there who love the Food Network channel and watching people cook. For me personally, I think I love eating more than cooking.. Can I just please sit here and watch you cook my food for me and eat it?  Pros: -very attentive service; down to refilling your water and checking up on you -get to watch the chefs cook your food, first row seating -bar table in a U shape (i prefer this to table eating)  -delicious, up to par food, you can't complain nor compare -approx 10-13 courses including the extras they give you -conveniently located above momofuku noodle bar and milk bar (can buy momofuku treat to-go or get pork buns to-go and stuff yourself with it.. cause it's that good)! -free birthday ice cream for birthday! -they cook and present you the food as you go; you set the pace of the course! !  Cons: -there isn't none; not even with money lol  Tip: make a reservation :))"}
{"text":"to me, ramen is something that you could eat every day - something light-ish and reasonably healthy (starch, veggies and a bit of protein). david chang's take on ramen is certainly good - great accompaniments, excellent depth of flavour - but it's also extremely rich (imo). it's not every day fare.  perhaps not quite this extreme, but it reminds of this... http://www.torontolife.com/daily/daily-dish/restauranto/2009/11/04/temperance-be-damned-eight-of-toronto%E2%80%99s-largest-restaurant-dishes/attachment/foiegras-3/"}
{"text":"An excellent fusion experience. I definitely love that place and I highly recommend it . The food looks amazing and taste awesome. I recommend the wine  menu to match it with the food . All good. No complains at all . Service is top notch."}
{"text":"This place was great!  I'm from California and could not pass up the opportunity to go to David Chang's restaurant. I'm a big fan of \"Mind of a Chef\" as well. My wife and I had the multi-course dinner and we were not disappointed. Sorry I didn't keep track and take pictures of the food but here are some memorable highlights.   We started with a potato soup with smoked fish, chives and topped with potato chips. Soooo good!  The smoked fish really stood out. Next we had some toasted rice cubes cooked in bacon fat. OMG it was like eating rice bacon. My mind was blown at that point. Lol. Later we had some cured mackerel. It's texture was very close to eating seared tuna. The fish was so flavorful and so good. Then came some duck sausage ragu with mushrooms and pasta. The flavors reminded me of carbonnade but tasted even better!  We were also presented with some chicken stuffed with sausage under the skin. Very unique flavors on the plate but tasted delicious!  Finally, we finished with two deserts. I really enjoyed the maple sorbet and pancake.   TIP: If you are in Toronto and would like to try a menu that you don't have any choice over and would like to try something different and be amazed, check out Momofuku Shoto!  Oh and when you are done, stop in at Milk and grab some cookies for later!"}
{"text":"I'm going to give this 4 because of the experience of the chefs cooking and blow torching food in front of our eyes. For ~$500 between for two (10 course plus split wine pairing) I'm not quite sure it was worth it. I guess it's random depending on what's available but throughout the 10 courses I didn't really experience any flavours I haven't before which is what I expected from this. It was all delicious but I think George was better to be honest they had alot more things in their tasting that made me wonder.  Also there wasn't many dishes that felt asian inspired, mostly local ingredients which is probably why."}
{"text":"I came here when I was visiting toronto. Their momofuku ramen was very good till I found a curly pubic hair on my ramen.. Totally disgusting and Iam still traumatized from that day."}
{"text":"Food was amazing!  One of the best meals I have ever have...ever!  I can't even describe the different flavour profiles of each and every dish.  They were definitely homey Asian-esque (if that's even a word) but unique.  Just note that you will be there for about 2-3 hours.  I didn't realized and was sad I couldn't get some cookies from the milk bar after dinner!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Very good can have a.  variety of things not the easiest on the Wallet but still worthy of a return"}
{"text":"BOTTOM LINE: The food's a solid 3-stars but the value's a solid 1-star.   Perhaps I'm too jaded by arbitrary industry rating systems and too cynical that it's all one big marketing ploy to get suckers like me to fork over wads of cash-money for celebrity chef establishments, BUT even in this world, Shoto seemed a bit 'meh' to me.   Given the menu frequently changes, I won't rehash each individual dish. The food is solid, the presentation is typical Momofuku-stylez (whether it's here or the restos in NYC), and it truly is a wonder watching the chefs work in machine-like efficiency in the kitchen.  Unfortunately, there just wasn't *that* one dish that stood out for me. A lot of Yelpers seemed to have enjoyed Shoto over Ko, but I felt the opposite. Again, the theme of Shoto is that it's solid but not stellar.   The staff were personable and attentive, though even as the industry shifts to more casual dining experiences, the short denim shorts on our male sommelier seemed out of place, if not outright garish. While not the fault of the resto per se, when I dined there, there seemed to be a disproportionate amount of slimy men and their significantly younger counterparts who selfied  themselves to death while gushing \"OMIGAWD, that was the best dish EVAAAAR\"....every single dish. Sure, you expect some of that at these types of restos, but this was quite something.  At the end of the day, it's hard for me to recommend Shoto over other great establishments in this town, especially given the price point. Perhaps, while not directly comparable, I'd probably recommend Actinolite, Kaji or even Bar Isabel instead."}
{"text":"Being a big fan of the Momofuku empire this was always on my list of must tries. Having had an amazing out of this world dining experience a few years back thanks to David Chang and his crew at Diasho ... i knew it would be hard to top.  My husband surprised me with reservations at Shoto for our 1 year wedding anniversary. Being pregnant, my husband made sure to advise Shoto that I was pregnant and wouldnt be able to eat certain items - like raw meat/fish. When we arrived, we were a bit early and seated at the bar to wait for our table. What followed was a well orchestrated performance of culinary skill and for me, foodie heaven. I was able to enjoy all of the dishes my husband did (10 courses plus around 4 snacks in between) and anythign that would have been prepared raw was cooked/seared for me.   The service was top notch, professional, and friendly. My husband got along super well with the beer sommalier (?) who helped him pair different beers according to his tastes. As for myself, I was recommended some nice mocktail like drinks. They were certainly okay, but nothing that I would order again - unfortunately I found the mocktails priced as high as his beer and really not too complex.   The staff took photos for us and each of the cooks took his time presenting and explaining each dish for us. There were about 4 or 5 standout dishes that really resonated with us. A few that perhaps my pregnant palate couldnt appreciate as much. Nonetheless, all plated beautifully and artfully.   This is likely the most expensive meal we have had for just us two, with the bill coming to around 500.00 after taxes and tip.   Would we return? unfortunately our budgets would never allow it - it was truly a splurge to celebrate a special occassion and to indulge before our little one joins our family and all our spendign money goes to baby items. I will however continue to visit the momofuku restaurants like Diasho and Noodlebar and the locations around the world because I believe in the product and those working behind it.   Its definately a dining experience to be had if your budget allows it."}
{"text":"Fun spot. Great cocktails and very good food. Interesting unique spot in downtown toronto."}
{"text":"The food was excellent; I would go back any day.  The only complaint, and it's a big one, is the bench seating. It's uncomfortable. I know it's trendy and minimalist but ugh... my back. Something to lean back on when you're eating or chatting. It makes it feel like a fast-food environment."}
{"text":"We were disappointed after our visit to this place. Overall the food were good, but not excellent. And it is expensive. Tasting menu is $150 pp. For that kind of money, you would expect everything to be perfect, but it wasn't. All the seafood courses were amazing. The arctic char was done beautifully and oyster was very fresh and sweet. However the other courses were less impressive. The cauliflower tastes like they were badly over-cooked, the fish balls in the soup were extremely salty, and the duck were partly salty and partly tasteless. Furthermore, the food portions are small so we had to go for 2nd round dinner because none of us were feeling full after the meal."}
{"text":"Came here for anniversary dinner with my wife. Service was great, I have to say I'm impressed with the food, the open kitchen, the exhaust fan is quiet and efficient. At least in the end, I don't walk out and smell like what I've ate. It is a tasting menu set at about 10 course, it is like an adventure set out by the ship captain- the chef, as we just sitting along for the ride while navigating different flavor and dishes. It Just keep me guessing what's to come, and can't wait for the next one. It didn't disappoint either, I was actually impressed by the taste. Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"My fiancee and I went to Momofuku Shoto tonight and highly DOES NOT recommend it to anyone.   For newbies, Momofuku has three levels, the noodle bar, the family restaurant and then the tasting menu - Shoto.  For two of us with only one person doing wine pairing it came out to (tax and 18% tip) was a little over $500.   Now we tipped 18% because we always tip a minimum of 18%...more if the service and food were excellent.   The service was good. Waiters were prompt. The ambiance was nice. It was kind of nice to see the chefs make the food but then you can get that pretty much at any Japanese restaurant. The washroom was disgusting. Seriously, if you are going to charge customers that much then keep the standard of the place to the same as other comparable restaurants in the city like Scarmouche, Splendido or Canoe to name a few.   We had gone to Kaji - a similar format Japanese restaurant before with a tasting menu for 100 or 120 and the food was great. So we had high expectation for Momofuku Shoto and were extremely disappointed. I had to drink 2 liters of water to rinse my mouth of each course. I portions are small as tasting menus are and neither of us could bare to finish each. Even the desserts were disgusting. I would not go back and definitely would not recommend this restaurant.  I had read great reviews and heard the hype about the Momofuku in New York as so was excited. We are foodies and often seek out the new restaurants to try out. The review on Globe and Mail by Chris Nuttall-Smith is unbelievable inconsistent with our experience. I wonder if he was served a different meal altogether. Joanne Kates who did the review column before Chris Nuttall-Smith was the most accurate - she gave them a crappy review.  Each of the dish we had were either not seasoned correctly or are way too sweet or way too spicy. I give them credits for the presentation of each dish - very colorful and well decorated. But the flavor was horrendous. I was hoping out of all the dishes, I would like at least one...but sadly none. The lamb dish was the worse.   Never again...this restaurant honestly needs to close down or change big time."}
