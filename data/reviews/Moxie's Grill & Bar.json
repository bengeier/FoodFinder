{"text":"Hello, 

Hello - Had the Beef vindaloo and it was great. Perfect meal for a snowy day in Calgary. The menu has some nice choices and the quality to price ratio is good. This is a chain restaurant that offers good service but if you travel a lot is just kinda what you get in all other chain restaurants, not that that is a bad thing it's just don't expect to be blown away for a 
culinary experience. It was in a nice new building just like all the other nice new buildings in that area. The service was very friendly, the meals came out fast and is exactly what I was wanted for my meeting."}
{"text":"celebrated my friend 40th birthday there last weekend, the food was great and so as the customer service. definitely go back again."}
{"text":"I'm writing this after the second time in a row, where me and my date have WALKED OUT before ever ordering our food. The staff watched us sit ourselves in the lounge part, and took forever to come and take our drink orders, only to never be seen again!! I had eaten there a few times maybe a year ago and the food was really good, but the last TWO TIMES I have not even gotten close to even ordering food"}
{"text":"Shared two appetizers with a friend: the med-bread with three dips and the sweet chilli chicken. Both were really good! 
Ended up sharing a white chocolate brownie and we already knew how amazing it was but just for the sake of this review......it was so.....SO.....good. 

Only negative thing I've got to say is that we didn't really get too much attention for a while but other than that the service was pretty okay. I think it also depends who's serving you, when I came last year with my mom we had a really sweet waiter who even gave us free hot drinks cause he had left us for a while and felt as if he wasn't serving us to the best of his ability. Even so, he was an amazing waiter so he was definitely tipped very well. Overall the service can be inconsistent but when it's good, its great. 

I love the atmosphere too :)"}
{"text":"A disappointment .... Have eaten here before and loved the food and service but not today . My fish tacos were bland and I think the fish was supposed to be hot and my Dads soup was cold and my brothers sandwich dry. For an average cost of $15 , the servings were small and not satisfying . The server seemed to be in another world , we had to ask her to take our order , it was hard to get her attention and we had to ask for our bill . Too bad ."}
{"text":"Do you like hair in your food? If yes, go to Moxies. Apparently their corporate policy is for women with long hair to keep it loose and not tied back. It is against policy to tie it back.  I must say that the waitresses hair strands in our bowl of ketchup was most unappetizing. When speaking to the manager, he said it was policy and he couldn't ask her to tie her hair back. Way to go Moxies!!!  Better to send back food with hair in it rather than keep the hair out of the food in the first place. What's happening in the kitchen then?"}
{"text":"I think Moxie's needs to have more vegetarian options! Also, Vegetarians please note their fries are fried in the same oil as their chicken. My last 2 visits here were really dissatisfying!  The service was incredibly slow although the restaurant was not busy and our food took forever to come! Would not be visiting for a while."}
{"text":"Horrible service on a Friday nights.

Waited 20mins for a pitcher. Another 40 mins for bread for our dip. And so far 30 mins for our dessert. Defeats the purpose of coming for a drink here since you are completely sober since coming here. 

We are celebrating a close friends birthday and this is beyond ridiculous. Wish we had gone to a different restaurant in the Square one area."}
{"text":"I went there for dinner the other night. I think that as far as business casual goes they are in the top 3. The restuarant itself is gorgeous, the food is great and there is evidently good staff training."}
{"text":"Great spot near airport. Comfortable and good food."}
{"text":"Really nice place and one of the best restaurants to grab a drink with a friend or meeting for work"}
{"text":"I went for a casual business lunch last week. The first thing we noticed was how loud the music was, not conducive to having a conversation. I wouldn't mind that volume level at all if it were after work hours, but not necessarily when you plan a lunch meeting and have to yell even at the waitress so she can actually hear your order. 
Service could have been better. 

I ordered the chicken parmesan sandwich with prosciutto, it was delicous! Asked for a side of sweet potato fries, overall I was stuffed by the end. I was really happy with the food but hope they actually consider the volume of their music.
There are so many offices nearby people will likely want to go for lunch to actually talk, so make it easier for them to have a conversation!

Lastly... most waitresses were barely dressed, good thing to think about depending on who you are going with!"}
{"text":"A very good place to enjoy delicious grilled food. Their smoothies menu is simply great. Must try their dark chocolate cake with vanilla icecream."}
{"text":"This Moxies location has been an annual gathering spot for me when I visit Calgary on business and its been consistently going downhill year after year in terms of service and food.  I noticed a similar trend at their Vancouver location on Robson that is now closed.

During a late lunch visit, I had to wait just under 5 minutes to get a hostess to greet us and the general feeling I got from the staff was they just didn't want to be there.  They used to be on par with other mid level chains but they have really fallen hard.  The food was mediocre at best with uncooked rice in my Teriyaki Rice Bowl and it didn't taste fresh.

We also had a nightcap in their lounge which has a good decor and lots of tv's to watch the game but once again the service was incredibly bad.  The server plopped menus on our table and walked away without even saying hello and the rest of our interactions were once again, as if we're doing her a favour by being there.

This is my first bad review on Yelp but I was so taken aback by the poor service that I had to comment on it."}
{"text":"Meh. You get what you get. I frequent this Moxie's. Not cause it's soooo amazing or anything more out of convenience. I've never had any major issues here. The staff is always pretty good and I have had consistent meals here.

The one thing I do find funny is on the weekends the lounge tries to hold mega loud parties that are few in attendees probably because the music is absolutely blaring. I came on St.Patty's day last year cause it was close to home and a cab wouldn't cost an arm and a leg and it was stupid loud! I think I only had 1 drink and we got out of there so fast. A few weeks ago they had a neon party. Listen your a place of food and drink not a club.

Stop trying to be a club! If I wanted to listen to shitty dj music and barely order my thoughts together I'd waste my money at the back alley.

Theme nights are only ok if you are telling your patrons in advanced and you all commit to it other wise it just looks silly. 

Food is sub-par... although I once had a staff member try to convince me my pasta was EL DANTE (not al dente) *face palm* and it was rock hard I could barley chew it. I ate it cause I was very hungry... but not in the least impressed with being told my food was cooked when clearly it wasn't oh well."}
{"text":"First time eating hrre, on a sunday evening, a full house, very busy. The haddock was amazing, simple sweet and tangy, flavourful.  The pasta was typical, oily and similar to any other chain restaurants, nothing special.  Upbeat restaurant, nicely rennovated and great date place, a lot of privacy. They were nice enough to allow us and sit for hours, after dinner and paying but was rude of them for not giving us water. Kind of indecent of them, afterall we did tip them for the service...overall, mediocre"}
{"text":"Terrible service, she barely existed other than ssayimg hi and taking our orders.  Food was extremely oily and nothing spectacular.  But they are busy because of the in mall location.  Otherwise, I would not even go.  Btw, first time eating at this location."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Moxie's location in Mississauga - way better than Square One
It is the newest of the locations in Mississauga with a nice patio and decent layout with seating.

My absolute Moxies favourites are the Moxies GT (Gin and Tonic) and the White Chocolate Brownie dessert. The GT is the BEST deal on Friday for $5.99, supersized and topped off with slushie -- I ask for no ice and extra slushie!! :)
Their white chocolate brownie is always a favourite and is offered in a smaller portion, but why would you want a mini sized version?!

I'm not a huge fan of the rest of their menu - but most things are decent.

The girls are pretty at this location and usually offer friendly service - food and bar pump out food at reasonable rate!

Hope this helps,
-jT"}
{"text":"Average.  My hotel recommended because they have \"great food\".  It was average. Cool place inside. Music in bar was loud. I had mango chicken. Chicken was black from too long on the grill. Mango tasted like dirty carrots. Veggie was edible as was the rice. Waitress was friendly. I wish the food would've been better so I could've rated higher."}
{"text":"The only thing missing from this place is a stripper pole. If your going on a date with a girl DON'T GO HEAR.  All of the staff are some hot sexy chicks, your ass is going to get in trouble. The last time I was there I couldn't stop myself from staring at booty & cleavage. I can't even remember what the food was like."}
{"text":"I agree with someone else who said this : \" The olny thing it was missing is a stripper pole\". The bad boy beers might be cheap on Friday but It dosen't really matter when the ditsy blonde serving you forgets haif the drinks you order just to screw up the bill in the end anyways. I found getting my boyfriend or a guy co worker was the best way to get them to come over to serve us which really bugged me.  The place itself I do really like and the wings have never disapointed me just the service needs to be better."}
{"text":"weird bar set up.  no bottles on display, slush machine on the ground and everything really low don't know how the servers do it! med bread is delicious.  Caesars the clamato is on a gun which  is never good...wanted more from the bar like out  west"}
{"text":"Visited the Scarborough location and our server Andrew was incredible, attentive and overall a great server. The food came out hot and was very tasty. The reason I likely won't go back is due to the G.M that was working today. When we walked in the hostess asked us if we wanted Lounge or Dining and the GM chimed in with some unnecessary comments about having to be 19 to sit in the lounge (I'm 24 and was with my mother). I'm sure he thought he was charming but both myself and obviously the hostess felt uncomfortable that he commented when he really didn't need too. While eating this obnoxious GM continued to comment at each table and interrupting all the guests as he spoke way to loud and ruined the entire atmosphere of the restaurant. If he is that forward to make comments to patrons, I wonder what he says to the female wait staff."}
{"text":"On est allé pour dîner avec mes collègues, on est sorti en disant bof... Manque de places et de stationnement , une chance qu'on est venu a pied !"}
{"text":"i had a steak sandwich . delicious and quick. my server Courtney who looks like a Persian was very nice . she recommended some fruit flavoured beer , which i really enjoyed."}
{"text":"I love Moxies. I've been to dozens of locations and have even worked at a few of them. This one, however, is consistently awful. The first couple times were automatically forgiven but after another 4-5 times of getting food coming out cold, steaks being overcooked, poor service and below average food I thought I'd finally given up on this place. That was until tonight when we decided to order take out but when we got home they'd forgot the stuffed potatoes on both our meals. Hardly worth driving all the way back but for a $65 meal we wanted more than just a couple slabs of meat. They didn't even make us fresh ones, we got the same stuffed potatoes that they'd made for us 40 minutes earlier. It explains why this place was completely empty on a Saturday night. Boooooo Moxies, booooo."}
{"text":"Our fav spot to go to for dinner and dessert. It's pretty much the same everywhere in terms of food and pricing but this location specifically is lowkey and quiet. Always space available on weekend nights. Good service and friendly servers."}
{"text":"Very good food. Would recommend the Thai curry bowl. Friendly helpful server."}
{"text":"Price:  Reasonable
Decor: Trendy, but not stuffy. Nice
Food:  Good value for price. Nothing horrible, nothing twitter-worthy
Service:  Typical early 20s, female, short tight skirt, likely in first serving job. A little slow, one small mistake, late table-check but pleasant.
Verdict:  Would return. But probably after I've visited a few competitors first."}
{"text":"The hype about Moxie's is nothing really. They are an overrated franchise chain that tries to disguise as an upscale restaurant where the prices are higher than average. The service is generally slow and of average quality (possibly due to the high stilettos and short skirts the waitresses have to walk in - definitely not a family restaurant). As for the food, the appetizers are all this restaurant can serve up best so leave the real main course meals to other gourmet restaurants."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times, each time hoping for a better experience. 
this time I came in for drinks and apps. 
it was not busy, there was more than enough staff walking around for the amount of people sitting in the dining room. 
it took 10minutes before anyone came to take our drink order. once she did......it took us 45 minutes to get two beers. service has ALWAYS been this terrible when I come here. we ended up leaving without ordering food because it took so long. 

as a side note. I came here for my birthday earlier this year and same thing happened. food came out wrong, poor timing between dishes while others were left waiting, and TERRIBLE service. 
extremely disappointed once again."}
{"text":"The decor inside is nice so I had high expectations.  The presentation on the food was good, but the taste was just so-so.  The service is also average.  I sat for a while and to flag someone down because I was ready to order and no server had shown up after the hostess said the server will be right with you."}
{"text":"Veggie burger and pina colada? Yummm. The dessert trying trio I'd highly recommend."}
{"text":"Nothing but bad experiences and bad food at this restaurant. We tried it a couple of times thinking perhaps it was an off night. Nope, that was not the case. The wait staff - ridiculous wait times and the restaurant wasn't even near busy (on the occasions that we went). Then the food - nothing came out prepared correctly or with enough heat. Everything was lukewarm. Ask to have it sent back - they still couldn't get it right. After the 2nd time sending our food back - we essentially gave up. They need to get better cooks, and more responsive wait staff. 
The only good thing about this place is the ambiance and decoration. Everything else needs to be revamped."}
{"text":"This Moxies is always busy.. Popular spot! I've never had a bad experience and have frequented this spot both for lunch and dinner or just drinks on the patio. The mojitos are my favorite!!"}
{"text":"I will start by saying 2 stars is generous. My partner and I went around 630 on Saturday  night  and thought Oh the parking lot is full it's a good sign. They advertise 2 patios but only one was open. So we thought the lounge as we just wanted drinks and appys. We still had to wait 5 mins to be seated even though there were 2 tables in the lounge. No one sitting at the bar not busy. But we still had to wait. Yes the music was so loud we were yelling at each other across the table. The actual server person was quite good Shalagh,  simply did her job.  The mojitos were yummy. The margerita  pizza was bland. Overall it felt like they didn't actually want or care to make it easy to be a customer. Way too many places in sw calgary super disappointed.  The whole fiasco to get seated and how they could've cared less why we were there. No wonder the place was dead on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"The place seems to be very nice, especially if you want to have a couple of drinks and a great dinner with a group of friends. Also really liked their everyday specials, and their burgers were absolutely delicious. Definetely returning there with my friends!"}
{"text":"I've been in Toronto on business for over a week and I'm very glad I discovered Moxie's. Very upscale and creative menu. I had the roasted beet and arugula salad which was delicious with just a tad too much dressing. My business partner had one of their pizza's which was also quite tasty. Prices are moderate but on par with other area establishments. If you are at one of the many airport area hotels, I highly recommend a stop at Moxie's."}
{"text":"Payed a visit after watching a late movie on St. Party's day. The place was very busy, and the restaurant was very loud; thus service was slow. It was hard to get the waiter's attention. We waited forever to order. 
Our waiter was very nice, and helpful. My previous experiences at various Moxies have been great, the servers are always kind, and the food has been slightly above mediocre. 
I was excited to eat here because of my past experiences, however I noticed that the prices increased and some of the food is not even worth it. Most of the food has lots of calories: between 500-1000+. My friend and I shared a nachos platter and calamari. The nachos were decent, until you reach the bottom where you realize that it's swimming in oil. I have made nachos at home, and never have I created such a disgusting dish. The calamari was alright, not worth the $14 at all. 
I was very disappointed with this overpriced, low-quality, tasteless food. Don't think I will be returning."}
{"text":"Just don't go here.. Food is a disappointment as it lacks flavour for the price point. I got the fish tacos and my boyfriend got a steak... Wouldn't recommend either. However, the white chocolate brownie was not bad if you have an overly sweet palate. Good location and has lots of potential though."}
{"text":"I love their sweet potato fries, my favourites! 
Their food is very good and their service is amazing. I do not have any complaints about this place. For a fancy restaurant, this is one of the best options"}
{"text":"I have eaten twice at this location in the past month. Both times the service was excellent! The food is good... I loved the chicken & salad and fell in love with the French toast."}
{"text":"The best service and best experience! Food was awesome and the staff are great! Would definately recommend this establishment to everyone."}
{"text":"We were walked in & hostess said the server would be around shortly. We waited 10 mins before anyone came by our table to ask us for drinks. We ordered the food at the same time as our beverages. The food came strangely quick. The potatoes were cold and the chicken was extremely chewy. I only ate the bread. I complained and the manager came by and apologized and removed the item from our bill which was fair, but wont be back anytime soon. Service is always so bad."}
{"text":"We go to this Moxies quite often, its super close to our place. Plus the service is really good. Tried the dry chicken wings in the past and it was VERY salty. Recently gave their chicken wings another shot, so took the honey garlic flavour... and it was so good. If your adventurous, ask for the hot sauce on the side! Honey garlic with a lil dip of hot sauce made it perfect. When it got too spicy dipping that mix in the ranch sauce that came with the veggies was just PERFECT.
Also ordered the Kale, Quinoa salad with chicken. It was good but was missing something, felt a little dry. So if you plan on ordering that, order it as is and then ask for lemon vinaigrette (I asked for this one) or balsamic vinaigrette dressing and parmasean cheese, mix these additional ingredients in and the full flavour comes out.  Very healthy, and very tasty.

From the drinks, almost all their drinks are really good but my fav fav is the Bellinis, they are soo good, i think they make one of the best in town.

Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"I had lunch here last week and I damn near had to send up a flare to get served. I sat in the lounge, which was not at all busy. Several minutes went by with no attention from any wait staff. A host eventually noticed that I wasn't being served and took my order. 

As I ate, I noticed that the waitresses were paying a lot of attention to the tables full of men. Hanging out to chat, leaning way over, sometimes sitting in the booth with them. That's when I got it. As a single woman, I wasn't their target audience. 

The food was OK, but not exceptional, and portions were quite small for what I paid."}
{"text":"If I can give negative stars I would.
Terrible service
Terrible food
Terrible over all 
High price. Bull Sh-t

Peach Bellini is great !

Can confirm"}
{"text":"The ambiance and service was excellent! They went out of their way to make sure everyone at our table was happy with their meal and able to enjoy their food without worrying about allergies. I'm definitely looking forward to going there again."}
{"text":"So in Scarborough you're pretty limited to restaurant chains and sometimes mediocre service. I've been to a few Moxie's locations (Richmond Hill, Fairview, etc.) and I don't really have a preference. The service is forgettable at best and the girls can be sometimes standoffish. I find that the guy servers are usually more attentive - they'll usually pack up my meal in the kitchen instead of just handing me an empty takeout box like the the female servers will do. The male servers tend to be more attentive and outgoing, whereas the girls tend to do the bare minimum in checking up on the table. All in all, if I'm looking for reliable food with good ambiance, Moxie's is a safe bet. I'm also a sucker for their bellinis and white chocolate brownies."}
{"text":"Good food, reasonably priced (but more on the higher prices), good service (sometimes), theres a bar!!! :) overall, decent."}
{"text":"Perhaps it is the location skewing my review slightly (I work nearby, and there is very little else around for lunch... with the crack corner location, and all) but I keep coming back to this Moxies for weekday lunches.

Atmosphere is fine -- typically I meet up with a friend, and this location is fine for chatting and catching up.  Quite often, the same friends later ask to meet again at this Moxies.  

Generally speaking, service is attentive, and my food arrives in good time -- key during the work week.

The menu is pretty diverse, which is one of the reasons I enjoy Moxies.  So I've tried everything from an almond-crusted salmon to a straight salad for lunch.  Never dissapointed.  

I should say, as well, that sometimes I'm pretty conscious of \"behaving\" during lunch (so I don't have to make up for it on a treadmill)... and restaurant food can be a gut-bomb.  That being said, there is a pretty good selection of main-course salads, with a wide range of styles and ingredients.  I've picked several as my meal, and they have been very satisfying."}
{"text":"I come to this location fairly often when I am in town. I order the exact same dish every-time, a medium-rare honey garlic steak. Unfortunately this evening it took four tries to get the steak right. The steak came out more brown with each try. On the third try the manager on duty brought out my steak and condescendingly tried to convince me that it was medium rare when it was clearly evidenced not to be. The brown steak was confirmed by my two guests who were dining with me and a host who was working at the time.  The chef came out and tried to convince me that medium rare for that dish took on that appearance but became silent once I casually mentioned that I order the exact same dish everytime that I am there. Overall the only thing that was saving the dinner from being the worst one i had to experience was the server. Management was rude, chef was rude, steak is clearly overcooked. 


Save your time and drive to a different location."}
{"text":"Solid option if you are looking for a decent meal. The late closing is useful if you are staying at one of the local hotels which seem to wrap up beverage service on the early side."}
{"text":"This moxies was terrible. We went for dinner and had the fish and chips, loaded burger, steak and chicken breast. The fish and chips was passable, the steak was dry, the burger over salted and the chicken breast dry also. So food wasn't particularly good. Service was pretty ordinary as well as it took ages to get water, glasses were constantly empty and it was difficult to order."}
{"text":"me and my kids  love moxie food ! we  always had good food and great service ! but my last visit was  bad experience  with desert but I am sill  very happy with them  they service was very kind and friendly !!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Very nice ambience, chic. Service is ok.
Food really mediocre. I ordered chicken Caesar salad (entrée size). It was smaller than I expected for the price. It didn't taste horrible, but there was nothing memorable.
All in all a little disappointing."}
{"text":"The quality of food is pretty consistent and there is a good variety on the menu. My favorite is the salmon salad and any of their appetizers.  

Special kuddos to the bartender Racquel for making me unsweetened iced tea, which strangely enough you cannot get anywhere in Canadian restaurants."}
{"text":"The food here is great and my family and I always have great service. They are very friendly and some of the staff even remember us when we return. The steaks aren't always cooked to perfection but the atmosphere is nice and laid back. I'm not keen on the fact that most of the waitresses are skinny girls who wear short dresses, and not that they don't look nice, but I always wonder what happens when people who aren't skinny and unwilling to wear mini skirts apply??"}
{"text":"I like this chain for the times where my family and I just want to go somewhere to sit back, relax and have a good meal. They have been experimenting with different chef items and the last time we went was pretty fantastic! The service here was very good, not in your face, but just enough. I would recommend this location."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of this place because of its consistency, options, prices, and overall atmosphere. Some of their chef inspired choices are very yummy, they should put more options on the menu however. For their purposes of being a lounge restaurant type environment I think they do a good job!"}
{"text":"After being seated, we waited ten minutes for someone to come acknowledge our existence.  Funny, there were at least five people waiting at the hostess desk, and yet no service?!  We walked out and went to The Keg instead."}
{"text":"In the surface, menu looks good, but falls flat on execution of some meals. Had an ahi tuna salad and the salad portion was very salty. Service is ok but not overly friendly. Great I suppose if you're interested in being waited on by hangry thin twenty something's in skimpy black dresses."}
{"text":"There's always a great selection of food and cocktails. Good  vibe, not too noisy. Have enjoyed the patio in the summer time as well!"}
{"text":"Good service. Good location for the meadowvale crowd. Service is great and the food is great. If you like the experience at the Moxies chain, this location will not let you down."}
{"text":"20 minutes waiting for a bill . Had to even go look around for someone to help me so I could pay and still they took their time to bring the bill to the table. The food is okay but not excellent ."}
{"text":"I've never really been a huge fan of chain restaurants and I think that's where Moxie's and I will never see eye to eye... In saying that the staff here are always friendly and always willing to go above and beyond to make your dining experience everything it can be. Their food is definitely tastier than your Jack Astors or Montana's and the ambience is much high class as well. 

If you're looking for something quick, easy and consistent- Moxie's is your place."}
{"text":"I enjoyed a \"Top sirloin steak salad with goat cheese\" today that my boyfriend surprised me with at work. He tells me that the Fairview Mall location was kind enough to discount the salad $3 because of an extra long wait he experienced. I had just started eating my salad when a co-worker tells me that my salad seems like it was missing something. At first I had no idea about what she was talking about, but upon inspection I realized that there was no goat cheese! I'm not sure that a $3 discount was enough to compensate an extended wait AND lack of goat cheese----- on a goat cheese salad, no less. All else regarding the salad was delicious: the steak was grilled to perfection, the greens leafy and crisp, the sauce sweet and tangy, and oh, that warm banana bread that melts my heart... The absence of the cheese was a little disappointing amidst a fabulous salad that I've ordered often before."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. The ambiance and interior of the restaurant is nice. The food is good although a bit on the pricy side. The staff is quite friendly and attentive. Good place, very typical American type foods."}
{"text":"Upscale chain restaurant to be sure but when in Brampton your options are somewhat limited. 

Went on a Saturday night with no reservation, was seated immediately with a party of six. Staff was very attentive and knew the menu. Recommendations were spot on. 

A little loud for forty something's in the bar but overall a good atmosphere. Patio open in September. Lots of parking as its a mall location. TVs with football on for those interested. 


Pasta entree was very good, enchiladas much better than expected. Arrived quickly and hot. Wings very small but tasty and cooked well as requested. 
Passed on dessert but the expected options are available at a reasonable price. 



Drink specials and enough on tap to keep most people happy. Dinner for four with drinks $115.00. Good value. 

Will return."}
{"text":"Service was great, beautiful decor. We ordered the fried calamari, we enjoyed it. For amiI had the Alfredo penne pasta which was really good. My husband ordered the sirloin steak with peppercorn sauce alongside steamed veggies which was a huge bunch of broccoli (I thought that looked weird). He was saying the steak was really dry even with the sauce."}
{"text":"Horrible service. 1. Did not have the meals we originally ordered and took our server 15 minutes to tell us that. 2. They brought out the wrong dish. 3. When they brought out the right dish, they forgot my side of a caesar salad. Overall, the food was not properly prepared and we left extremely unsatisfied."}
{"text":"Has a holiday lunch with my girl friend on the 22nd. The service was good which the se ver provided options. 
We both ordered tuna salad. Overall the food was good and ambience was good. For food value the area of yonge and Shepard, it was what I expected. 
Would have liked a bit more variety but it is a chain restaursnt."}
{"text":"Always good food. The menu had a lot of options to choose. I brought my 9 year old son there because we wanted a casual dinner but didn't want fast food. He got a cheese pizza that he liked and I got to choose from more adult meals. The erupting volcano dessert for kids was impressive. He loved it."}
{"text":"The food here was amazing! We ordered the newyork steak. It couldnt be done better. Also great staff everything came on time .Coming back for sure."}
{"text":"consistent experience across this chain so far

food was great, our server was attentive and made sure we never ran out of drinks, and the atmosphere was great. really made our evening after a friend and i were in town for business. 

happy to have stopped here after a poor experience at a restaurant across the road a couple of nights before"}
{"text":"Very nice place. Food is excellent. The customer service is pretty awesome, especially Julia. I will be going back soon. keep up the great work."}
{"text":"I am giving this Moxie's 4 stars not because of good service or even a great dinning experience, but because of the care and follow up of the General Manager Russell. 

We stopped in for lunch Saturday March 7th and didn't have the best experience or food which happens from time to time at any restaurant. I left unsatisfied and decided to make a comment on Moxie's website as I felt they should be aware and within 2 days I had a message from the GM of this location. Russell was apologetic and asked for as many details as possible so that he could address my concerns with his staff. He also offered to make things right on my next visit should I be willing to give them another chance which I will solely based on this customer service. 

I have the opportunity to visit a lot of different restaurants and bars around Calgary due to my job and I really appreciate a company that accepts their mistakes and does what they can to ensure customer satisfaction."}
{"text":"Nice bar and grill with better than average food at a fairly decent price.  Very nice on the inside with great friendly staff.  Full bar with a good variety of food.  Had a good time here and will definitely come back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"We were having a kids bday party at the Chuck E Cheese across the parking lot and decided to bring our group for lunch. We had about 30 people - mix of kids and adults. We had two servers assigned to our group and they were both accurate and attentive. I know how crazy it can get with large groups but this crew handled it with ease and grace. The food was amazing as well. to be honest I don't expect much from chain restaurants but I was impressed. It came out hot, well presented and more importantly it was delicious. Thank you to the staff and management for a great end to a great birthday :)"}
{"text":"Do not eat here unless you like frozen, boxed food, or just like crappy overpriced food (sorry if I offended).  The service is so slow and watching the waitresses makes me even more annoyed.  No one came over and asked how things were, we had to each time flag her down.  I don't understand why a chain restaurant can't run as smooth as say Terroni (any location) and Gusto; just to name a few. There was 12 of us and we ordered:

Calamari (2 orders) - over cooked first off and there were so many small bits they were just gross since over cooked and tiny.  There is a BT which stands for moxie's executive chef - brandon thordarson draws on his international training & his love of world cuisine to fuel his passion for fresh contemporary dishes.  Moxie's need to get there staff in check because this is a JOKE!

haddock with lemon quinoa | sautéed kale leaves, edamame beans & fresh herb chimichurri -  Again there was a BT beside this dish. Gross!  The fish didn't taste fresh at all and over cooked. I had no clue where this chimichurri was on the dish. I love chimichurri too but didn't see any.  The whole dish was a flop really.  The lemon part was a small slice of lemon on the side I guess for me to squeeze on the dish.  LOL!  

Nachos - double cheese nachos - those weren't good either.  I think there should of been layers of cheese.  

dry ribs - tasted like dry deep fried jerky

grilled fish tacos - fish was not fresh or even portion in each taco. Also the lettuce slaw (if thats what they call it) was not fresh tasting either. I also didn't taste any of the valentina hot sauce because it was more mayo based. They were gross.

 Wild mushroom pizza - was ok thank goodness.  

sirloin with compound prawn & lobster butter | 7 oz cab® sirloin with chorizo, baby potato & corn hash with chimichurri - was ok but still poorly executed. Steak wasn't that great so good thing there was that butter on top.  Again where was the chimichurri?!

Burger - was good finally something good! 

Stay away from chain restaurants in my opinion. This city has so many other opinions that are way better than Moxie's, Jack Astors, etc."}
{"text":"The food was a-ok. Our server was great but had a to push for their special menu and its seems a mouthful to sell. I didn't like being seated where the people traffic from the outside parking lot. It seemed like I was eating downstairs at the food court. Its pricey for a-ok so to me its not really that great. I want to be wow'd if I have to pay for my entree about $20. Its just a fancy chain."}
{"text":"Moxie's in Fairview Mall is conveniently located at Sheppard and the DVP.  They even have a great patio so you can enjoy dining alfresco at the mall!  

Moxie's drink features - both with and without alcohol -- are always super tasty and really fun, too.  Their servers are good and, while the service can be slow, the interior is swanky, but comfortable, enough that you don't have the urge to bolt while you wait.

If they have the baja fish tacos when you go, have them -- they are lime basted and delicious!  I've had several other items from the menu and all have been very well-seasoned and well-portioned.  The best part is their dessert menu which features \"bites\" of each item, the P-E-R-F-E-C-T way to get that little something sweet at the end of your meal without walking out with a huge muffin top!"}
{"text":"Food came very quickly and it was hot. There was almost no wait for a table and the restaurant including washrooms was very clean. One of the meals we ordered was very deceiving. In a seafood linguine there was only 3 pieces of shrimp! 

The ribs and bruschetta,  oven roasted chicken, magheritia pizza and chicken fingers and fires were all very good, however then ribs didn't have any dipping sauce whatsoever.

The service towards the end was very slow, when we were getting our bill but overall it was a very nice experience."}
{"text":"Already a regular at this new Moxies and I have to say they treat me very well. The room is modern and very high energy. My latest visit was on the indoor patio where I was able to watch the raptors with my family. The 5 dollar pints are the best deal around and I can't say enough about the amazing calamari. You won't be disappointed and if you have any concerns ask for the manager Sheri she is fantastic."}
{"text":"I love Moxies because of their white chocolate brownie, but recently had a bad experience. For the first time ever, I walked out of a restaurant.

I'm usually very patient but waiting 50 minutes was too long for such a simple meal we ordered. I am pretty sure our waiter forgot to enter our order in. I know this can happen especially if it's busy, but did not appreciate being lied to as to how long we have been waiting and being told it would be ready in 20 seconds (after already waiting 45 minutes). 5 minutes later, still no food, so we left.

Probably would still go to a Moxie for the brownie but maybe at a different location."}
{"text":"I love yelp.  Finally, I have a place to vent.   I went to this Moxie's about 3 years ago that left a bad taste in my mouth ever since.  

 I ordered the Black peppercorn steak.  I will never ever forget the terrible taste that made me think of coal.  In fact, I still have a picture of this terrible meal simply because I had intended to complain, but never got around to it.

The worst part of the meal wasn't the steak that was bitter and burnt on the outside - it was the service I receieved after I complained.  The waitress & manager tried to convince me that it was not burnt .  I have had very good Black Peppercorn Steak in the past so I was surprised by the unreasonable reactions of  the staff and management   

When it seemed that nobody was willing to help me (and I definitely did not want to continue chewing on carciogenic steak, I personally brought my steak to the kitchen to complain.  Finally, they gave me another dish but without any apologies.   I don't think I will ever go to a restaurant that makes patrons feel bad for complaining about burnt food."}
{"text":"I came out here last time I was in the Toronto area.  I enjoyed the food, although it was a little on the pricey side.  It was difficult to get American Football on the tv's but I was in Canada so I shouldn't complain.  

The staff is very friendly and the food is pretty good.  I just think the prices are on the high side.  Fortunately, I used the corporate card for my meal.  I probably wouldn't come here if I had to pay out of my own pocket, but I would consider going back if it was on a business trip."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for dinner on Wed Aug 19th. I had ordered a spring mix starter salad. And there was no description on the menu and I was ok with a plain salad. I asked what type of dressing they had and the server said \"Well you know, vinagarette and other ones that are on the menu.\" Then he brings me a salad with goat cheese, cranberries, tomatoes and carrots. Not what I expected. He said, \"Well you just have to read the menu.\" Little did he know there was no description in the menu. Also, he spent most of his time socializing with staff who were on their break in the booth beside us instead of serving us. When asked if he could give some info on some of the dishes he said he wasn't sure. I don't know what you like. My roasted chicken breast was super dry and the food was less than mediocre for the prices you pay.  Terrible service and I will not return or recommend this resteraunt to anyone. Better off to go to the Keg!"}
{"text":"my review is for the white chocolate brownie!! order it. too bad i live in san francisco and am no where near a moxies."}
{"text":"Went here for a Staff Xmas dinner (yep, early one).  Ambiance is nice.  Service was attentive and polite.  I ordered basic nachos.    Been here a few times, food is okay, nothing special.   This is one step up from a McDonalds food on a good day when it comes to food rating.

While waiting, we opened our napkins to set the cutlery.   This is the part that grossed me out, the cutlery was obviously not cleaned as there was dried gunk on it.  I grabbed one from the table next to us, no gunk but had this greasy feeling to the touch.   I called the waitress over and let her know the cutlery was not cleaned properly.   So she grabs another set next to our table.  I asked her to open it and inspect it.... of course it had a greasy film to it.   She goes back to the kitchen to get me a clean clean set of cutlery, the manager comes back bringing the cutlery and apologizes.   As a goodwill gesture he says we can have a free appetizer.

Of course the internal alarm bells go off.  I now take a closer at a bread plate, mine was fine but the person next to me felt it was \"Greasy\".  

Nachos came, I ate the top part and left a layer of nachos so I would not have to eat any part that was touching the plate. 

I don't plan to visit a Moxies again."}
{"text":"We went in on a Thursday night. Moxies always stands out for its decor and ambience. This stand alone location has to be our fav for their decor. Love the open kitchen concept. The kitchen can be seen from the dinning room side and is bright and clean. We were seated immidiately and our server offered us the menu. She quickly went over the special for the night on the drink menu. We ordered the mosaic dip for appys, love the slight kick it has to it. For main I got the Fish tacos and they were a decent healthy option. The fish is grilled and not fried in these tacos. The best part was definitely the dessert. We got the tasting trio and loved all our 3 options!! Would definitely go back for the food and service received."}
{"text":"Indifferent service.
Nice interior & washrooms.
Food: Specials are good. No complaints.
Drink: Beware the $4 \"fresh\" Orange Juice; it's from a grocery store carton; decidely not fresh.
A little pricey for the overall package."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant. Looks good, nice menu with yummy food and drinks. Fast service, and friendly staff. I love coming here with friends!"}
{"text":"I ordered the ribs with chicken breast. It was good. But service was not good enough a pretty fancy restaurant like that."}
{"text":"I'm not usually a big fan of chain restaurants, but I must say, I really did enjoy dinner there last night.  We had the Monday $3.50 wings as an app, and I must say, quite tasty.  For dinner I had the NY Strip my wife had the steak oscar.  Both were excellent, the stuffed potato was a nice accompaniment.  I could see how sometimes the food could potentially be off, but the atmosphere was nice and I was pleasantly surprised.

I'll try it again, even just for the $3.50 wings!"}
{"text":"Should have read the reviews before I took customers there tonight.  Was here about a year ago and it was very good. 
However that was not the case tonight.  Had a Caesar salad, which was ok except for the croutons, which were very stale.  Ordered a filet for dinner, and it was very thin (overlooked) and very fatty. 
The service was ok, but not impressive. 
Too many other good places in the area, especially for the prices. 
I cannot recommend this place anymore."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere, beautiful decor, decent but uninspired food and good service overall. Although the server we had was fairly inattentive and slow, the manager was pleasant and fixed things. The ribs I had were served lukewarm rather than piping hot, had a good consistency and delicious sauce, but the potatoes and broccoli were about as good as I would make them and boring to boot. My wife's steak was done appropriately but less flavorful than other high-end places we've been to, and the sides were once again very bland. The dessert cakes had too much flour in them, except for one which had a very good pate style. The beers on offer were a decent selection of craft brews."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Moxies end this location is the best of the best.   The good, service and drinks are excellent.
I've tried most of the food on the menu and I have yet to be disappointed.   The dry ribs and mosaic dip are amazing and consistently excellent.   During our most recent visit Dimitiz made us feel welcome and provided excellent service and was engaging in conversation about environmental issues.   
Half price glasses of wine on Tuesdays are a treat deal as are half price bottles on Wednesday.   

Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Had dinner here on a Monday night with a few folks from the office. Food was decent for the price.  About what one would expect from a chain restaurant.  Atmosphere was nice. Only issue I would say is they don't have a lot of table options available for groups of more than about 6."}
{"text":"Overall a really good experience. I recommend the blackened chicken burger and the calamari. The service is really good, but it gets quite busy."}
{"text":"Expected better.  As we reached the hostess desk, the hostess was excitedly greeting her friends instead of us which was awkward.  It was 3pm so the restaurant was not busy and they seated us quickly.  We had to wait awhile until our server came to introduce herself and take our drink order. I had the mediterranean burger which was delicious but the sweet potato fries were totally cold.  My daughter had a vegetarian burger with fries and was pleased with both.  The server did not come over to ask us about our meal until we were on the last mouthful (nor if we wanted another drink) so we did not get the chance to complain about the cold fries.  When we did tell her about the fries she was apologetic and offered something else...not likely I would take up the offer having finished my meal but I guess was the right reaction.  We did not feel welcome nor looked after...perhaps if we had been male, the service would have been better..who knows...not coming back."}
{"text":"What a Disappointment !!!  Last trip to Moxies (Shawnessy) 

Moxies is usually very good. One of my favourites is their Med Bread. Tried this location as it was near where we had just moved. We were glad there was a Moxie's in the neighbourhood and I expected to have a nice bite to eat there. What a disappointment! 
Atmosphere:  so-so - was clean
Food: Med bread comes with three dips. The salsa dip was about 80% hot red onions with  very little tomato and some other ingredients. The garlic dip was not blended at all - the dip consisted of  four or five chunks of cream cheese ranging in size from that of two loonies to a nickel - very little sauce.
Service: terrible. Server never did check back after food was served. Sure could have done with a coffee refill. Waited a long time to get the check. I finally put my coat on and went to the front desk to pay. Found another customer doing the same thing, he  couldn't  wait any longer as he was meeting a client.
Unfortunately, I can not recommend this Moxie's location."}
{"text":"Looks like I may be the first to write a review for this place. 
What can I say this Moxies has definitely taken the Ontario model and stepped it up a notch for Quebec. 
Typical Moxies uniform standards/expectations keeps the eyes occupied...! Very impressive and certainly no complaints! This place rocks. 
This is the first Moxies in Quebec and they are 100% committed to looking after the diners. 
The Managers took the time to come over and introduce themselves to make sure we were happy. Waitresses were also extremely friendly. 
As for the food, I went in thinking that quality may be less then expected due to them only being open two days and the chefs would be 'learning the ropes' so to speak but this was definitely not the case. All members of our party enjoyed their food and had zero complaints. 
Well done Moxies! Will definitely be back next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"Pretty much my go to place drinks in the neighbourhood for drinks as they have daily daily specials. I particularly like coming here on Tuesdays for 1/2 price house beer and wine and Fridays for GT.

They also serve great food with a variety of options to choose from. As well, portions are generous and ranges from $12-$25 depending on what you order. There fries are thick cut and is every delicious, I would recommend getting that as a side.

It does get pretty busy on Friday nights, so I would book or come earlier to avoid line ups and not to have to search the plaza for a parking spot."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for their Tuesday special. They do have drink specials everyday which is great. It was around 5pm and the bar was pretty filled, but were quickly seated in the dining room area. The server must be new and made really awkward interactions with us, but he did provide good service overall which was of course most important. 

I'm guessing because this is a downtown location, they limit their specials. Usually tuesday specials include 1/2 off reds and whites 6oz or $5/6 for their amber and blonde house beer. However, this was only limited to house red and white. Both are just alright, nothing worth mentioning.

We also ordered fries and calamari which were both good. Also be mindful, unless you want to pay $7 for sweet potato fries instead of $4 regular fries, don't order it. We ordered it once and had no idea there would be such a big difference. Usually restaurants only charge a $1 more and the server last time did not mention that either.

It's a convenient location for commuters as it is close to union station, but otherwise I would suggest considering other restaurants nearby."}
{"text":"Food was aweful,... Over microwaved mosaic dip,... Too salty ginger curry,... And over cooked rice."}
{"text":"Ordered the wild mushroom pizza on Saturday for dinner; within 45 mins of eating it I began to feel ill. Once I arrived home I had terrible stomach pains and had nausea and vomiting all evening. Definitely was food poisoning and I'm convinced it was the mushrooms on the pizza. I have no allergies and wasn't sick otherwise. I'm contacting the Restaraunt to notify them to get rid of that batch of mushrooms to avoid other customers falling ill as well as contacting public health. I won't be going back. Would not recommend the restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"I will start by saying I do like Moxie's atmophere and decore and I have never been disapointed in the food. With that said the reason for the poor rating is all about the servers in this particular location. I have been to other Moxie's and have had wonderful service. But there is something wrong with this location. I have eaten at this square one location about 4 times now through out the years and last night was the last is the last time i will go there. To start off I met my party of 4 there about 9pm and the place was only half full. The server took 15 mins to come and take out order and just as I was about to give her my order I looked down at the menu to recall the dish name and in that 5 seconds of doing this she had turned her back to me and began to take and order from the the table accross from us. I was like \"she did not just do that\"!? Then she turns back with stupid big smile on her face and says \"now what can I get you\". So she takes my order then walks away. She didn't take our drink order. I had to call her back and say I would like to have a drink. So she took my drink order and not the rest of my party's. We had to call her back again to say the rest of the table would like to have drinks too. The food came and it my friends sidedish was wrong but easily corrected as it was just a salad. This server was just not on the ball and i'm done with this location."}
{"text":"The restaurant was busy the night I went in, being the Sunday before Valentine's Day. Had a little trouble meeting up with date because they have two entrances, one outside and another on the inside. When we figured that out, we were taken quickly to our seat in a small booth.

The service was relatively prompt considering the crowd and we started with our water and calamari within 10 minutes. Followed by steak and salad. The food was prepared well and tasted good. The only complaint that I have is them leaving behind our finished plates at the table.

The desserts were a good ending to the experience, they were delicious and looked wonderful."}
{"text":"We dropped by the restaurant without reservation this weekend. Overall it was a pleasant experience. The restaurant staff worked hard to make us comfortable. Seating was quick.  Food quality was reasonable for the prices we paid.  We had sirloin steak with jumbo prawns  for $27 and honey ginger pork striploin  for $22. I had apple pie for desert.  Wine, drinks, taxes and tips made it a total of $95. Not too bad."}
{"text":"I went to Moxie's once in Moncton NB and it was so good. I was expecting the same from this one but sadly it was not the case. I ordered the veggie burger and it was pretty good but my boyfriend steak was too cook (medium instead of medium-rare) and our friend had a medium steak instead of well done. He asked for another one and it took at least 30 min to get it. The dessert part was the worst. I ordered the ''salted caramel and pecan cheesecake'' and it was specially marked has a dessert from the executive chef Brandon Thordarson so I was expecting something good.... it was dry, didn't taste caramel or either pecan!? My daughter ordered the ''White Chocolate Brownie'' and it was so dry that I had to cut it for her and thought I'd brake the plate with the spoon. Our friend got a mini serving of that same brownie because it was his birthday, after he taste my daughter brownie he said it was not the same thing at all... his was soft. We didn't asked for a refund or another brownie because when we realize that, my daughter had almost eat the whole thing. The server was really nice though but I will not go to Moxie's again."}
{"text":"Stayed at the Sandman so Moxie's was convenient.  Ate there twice, having the rustic pizza with grana padano, pulled short rib, caramelized  onions, prosciutto & pancetta.  Very good.  The next days sweet chili chicken was just okay.  But.. I've become addicted to their Blue Zen Martini.  Now to recreate it down here...  :)"}
{"text":"Went here for beers. Average sort of pricing for drinks. 
The decor is pretty nice and the barman was good at his job."}
{"text":"There's only one reason for me to go to Moxie's, and no it's not for the cute waitresses... I come here because they serve Big Life beer on tap, which if you didn't know is brewed by Big Rock Brewery out west. Probably one of the last big Canadian brewers not owned by an international brewery... It's good to see that Moxie's is staying true to its western Canadian roots.

Moxie's cocktails (Bellini, Coronita cocktail, etc.) are pretty popular because they're a little flashy and get a lot of attention, but if you want to try something different, order the Iceberg, which is Margarita lime slush in your beer.

But... if you just order the Iceberg, you'll get lime slush with the Amber brew and the combo of bitter amber beer and slush doesn't work that well. It's not on the menu, but you can order the Iceberg Euro, which is a blond beer. Much better alternative to a Corona with lime or that Bud Lime crap.

The plus side is that the slush keeps your beer icy cold! If you want to really get creative, try the Big Life Euro with the slush they use for the Bellini for a tasty alternative to lime beer!"}
{"text":"Moxie's - Market Mall location

My recommendation - if you are at the mall and want a sit down restaurant go to the Milestones on the other end of the mall.

My food was cold, my dad's food was cold. My mom's garden salad was sad, I could have made a better one at home. She wanted it with a chicken breast no salt however that could not be done as we were told they get the chicken in pre-seasoned - and I am assuming frozen.

Service was slow. There were 3 other tables around us and the manager had to come out to each of those tables at some point while we were there. Will not be going back to this location."}
{"text":"I've had only terrible experiences dining in this specific location... I've dealt with everything from moody waiters, long waits, and rude management. I don't know what it is about the Fairview location, but it just oozes out bad customer service. The food is alright. After my last meal at this location, I vowed to support more local restaurants around the area (there are so many wonderful places to eat in North York!) than this overpriced, generic chain."}
{"text":"Three star average rating for this place? Come on! No way! Its at least 4, maybe 4.5. The place looks great, the food is great, and the service is exquisite (wink;)

The sesame tuna appetizer is awesome! The  sticky toffee pudding is incredible! The steak is always properly cooked to specification! I cant believe some of the reviews im seeing on here. 

Way better than the Keg or any other restaurant in this plaza."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant I have ever been to in my whole entire life. Today I decided to go to Moxies Yorkdale with a good friend of mine. I ordered the white chocolate brownie and she decided to order the dark chocolate cake. After a couple of bites, my friend found a strand of hair which we believe was baked inside the cake. We informed the waitress about what we found and she immediately gave my friend another dark chocolate cake to go. As I took a bite into my dessert, I also found a strand of hair in my white chocolate brownie. My friend and I told the server about the strand of hair found in my dessert and the manager was called over to our table. The manager apologized but then tried to imply that we planted the strands of hair in our desserts. My friend made sure to let him know that we would never do that and the strands of hair were not found on top of the desserts but baked inside. The manager apologized again and decided to not charge us. Just thinking about tonight makes shiver. I hope anybody considering going to Moxies find this info useful."}
{"text":"For my first experience at this place, I'm quite frustrated. Took forever for the food to come, and didn't taste that good. Is good, but not for the price that is charged."}
{"text":"This was MAH PLACE TO GO.
That's all changed sadly.
I used to come here on every first date. For the location and where it's at.. I've never seen it extremely busy. 

Over the last year, I found that it's slipped a bit from where it used to be.
The Menu is all the same - Usually I just go with a Burger and a Bellini.

The Bellini is where it's been hit the hardest.
I used to come to this location and it used to be filled to the brim with goodness.
Now you're lucky if it even comes close to the top.

If you're going for Dinner; Get the Beef Vindaloo - It is by FAR the best thing on their menu.
Stay away from the Steaks. Been disappointed everytime."}
{"text":"What can i say.,,, Moxie's ain't no stranger 

This one is is pretty new- so, i think the cooks and everyone else are pretty new, too. Pretty neat place, it's nice  and calm. Our waitress was sweet and friendly, a bit too cheery but it's OK :) i prefer that over the snotty bitchy not so cheerry type. 

anyways, typical fusion food. I ordered the Chipotle Mango chicken. I also had ketchup on the side. Yes, i eat everything w/ ketchup cuz i love it. Surely, my meal came with its' own sauce. But i want my ketchup. I got my meal, my friends did too and we ate.  
My girls thought what i'm having is weird- the chicken and ketchup knowing the chicken has its' own sauce.  Well, let's just say: Thank god for heinz ketchup. 
Chicken was a little bit too uhh...soft. I tasted the spice, which was good- taste is good. colour is good. And then i tried the sauce- and it tasted like water and tomatoes. i thought in every saucy type of food, it is the sauce that makes the foood fantastic. Maybe. But, unfortunately, not my chipotle.   

Order something else. Maybe if you're lucky, you get a good cook.

In ketchup i trust."}
{"text":"The restaurant itself, was very nice. The decor was really nice and the booths were very comfortable, that being said, that was probably the only nice thing about this restaurant. 

it took at least 15 minutes for someone to come take our order in the first place. I find moxies has a very unique menu and if you not into trying new things, you might have a hard time finding something on the menu (like I did myself) 

My friend got a salad, and I had a sandwich. I got a gravy with my meal, which was cold. Other than that, the food was okay. 

I dont think I will be eating at a Moxies again, unless its not my choice."}
{"text":"I was here about 2 months ago, it was super busy so service was slow. The food was exceptional. I had great company so it was easy to pass the time."}
{"text":"We came here for a birthday dinner on a Saturday night at 9pm. We were the only table in the restaurant, really odd for a Saturday night. They forgot to take an order for one of the people in our party. The food took over an hour to come. Worst service I've experienced at a Moxie's, especially with the restaurant being empty. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Ugh. I've had to eat here a couple of times because of work events. This of course makes the scantily clad girls super awkward...
If you're vegan there is not much you can eat. You're looking at an overpriced salad that you've negotiated with the server to make sure you're getting food at all. I called ahead and planned something out with the manager, who was pretty helpful. But it did still mean I was paying a ridiculous amount of $$ for lettuce and a couple of strawberries. And for the most part they are terrible when dealing with people with dietary considerations:
1. I ordered a salad and asked for no meat or cheese. You'd think they would put more of the other ingredients in it to compensate, but no - so I was essentially eating just lettuce with a very very sparse sprinkling of nuts. ALSO they served it WITH THE MEAT! and then clearly just took off the meat and gave it back to me instead of making a new one. EW. The manager apologized and said it wouldn't be charged - very nice. However, this didn't get communicated to the server who DID charge me for it!
2. Their \"vegetarian green beans\" are made with beef broth! When I told the person that that wasn't \"vegetarian\" she argued it was \"just the broth\". I totally don't trust them at ALL to know what's in their food or to care if someone can't eat something."}
{"text":"Perhaps it was the lunch hour or it was because I was ensconced away in a cozy little booth on the perimeter of the restaurant or that my server was a guy but I didn't really get a feel for the \"Hooters\"-esque servers at Moxie's. Yep, my guy was fully clad with not a scintillating view in sight, a tad on the scatterbrained-side (perhaps that's the Hooters server in him... yes, I've been to Hooters and yes, I've dealt with some of their more \"scatterbrained\" servers.). In fact, most of the servers I saw yesterday were male. Not really anything to write home about. 

On to the menu. Prices are slightly inflated here for what it is, especially for some of their regular entrees, but off the lunch menu? Pretty reasonable. Moxie's seems to have a salad lovers following and my friend had the Lime Mayan Chicken Salad and really seemed to enjoy it. It looked pretty substantial but I'm not really a salad-for-an-entire-meal kind of girl. 

As soon as I saw the Lobster and Brie Grilled Sandwich ($15), I started salivating. Lobster? And cheese? In a grilled cheese? Oh yes please! It's worth mentioning that the sandwich also came with a small spring salad on the side. Spring greens, cranberries, feta and a light dressing. Good complement to the grilled cheese. And oh what a grilled cheese it was.

I am a lover of grilled cheese sandwiches. This one was pretty darned good. The bread was marbled to a golden brown perfection. You know that little bit of crunch when you first bite in with the soft layer of bread just below the surface? That was there. Then came the cheeses... Brie, cheddar... warm, melted, ooey goodness. And enveloped in the cheese was a good portion of lobster meat and the occasional hint of grilled onions. I'll wipe the drool off my face now as I sit here recalling the savoury goodness of yesterday's lunch.

I've given this Moxie's a 4 stars... simply on the merit of this grilled cheese (and the service was decent). I can't speak for anything else on the menu but what I can say is that I will be returning for the grilled cheese. In the near future. Maybe even today."}
{"text":"We had a very disappointing brunch at Moxies. The food was bland and the portions were tiny. We started with the shrimp tacos ($10). What arrived were 4 tiny (bite-sized) tortilla shells, filled with almost-stale shrimp (toughest shrimp I've ever eaten) smothered in mayonaise. Absolutely disgusting. 

We had a variety of dishes for brunch, none of which were much better. My \"spicy\" pasta was bland as bland. The lobster benedict was OK-tasting, but tiny and overpriced. And the breakfast omelette was basic as can be. I'd expect this kind of food from a diner at the corner at half the price; it was insulting to be served this at a Moxie's. Adding insult to injury was the waiting time. We waited 30 minutes for the shrimp tacos to be delivered. Our waiter hadn't entered our entrees, so not only did we then have to wait another 40 minutes for our food to come, but he also forgot our entrees, so we had to re-order after the shrimp tacos came. Bland food, ridiculous prices and awful service. Stay away."}
{"text":"Only reason its two stars because the service and drinks were good. But my friend and I are both suffering from upset stomachs after eating some appetizers here. The potstickers did taste a bit shady... Sorry Moxie's... You are now on my \"sh!t\" list"}
{"text":"Like this place but disappointed they took the avocado spring rolls off the menu ......"}
{"text":"I went to this specific Moxie's the other day with my girlfriend for brunch. I wasn't even aware that Moxie's did brunch so I was pleasantly surprised when I got there. We didn't have to wait for a table at all. Our server came by shorter after we sat down and poured us some waters while we looked over the menu.

My girlfriend and I decided to go with their \"Brunch Special\" which basically provides you with a bowl of fresh fruits to start, than a choice of your main and a wonderful glass of sangria. I ordered their Smoky Bacon & Aged White Cheddar Omelette with Sautéed Onions, Rösti Potatoes and Multi-Grain Toast. The omelette was filled with gooey cheese and strips of bacon. It was delicious! The rösti potatoes were beautifully cooked as well.  We definitely did not regret our choices at all. 

Overall, the atmosphere at Moxie's was different from what I expected probably because I usually go there for dinner. It was nice and relaxing. Only downfall was where we were sitting. We were right beside the kitchen and we could see everything that was happening in the kitchen area including the two servers flirting with one another, one of the cooks yelling, employees cracking jokes at one another...it made it a little difficult for my girlfriend and I to have a conversation. It also make it awkward when you know what your server did over the weekend...lol"}
{"text":"I don't normally gravitate toward chain restaurants by choice. On the rare occasion I do, Moxies is it! Met another family of four here for saturday dinner. They gave us a huge table in the back...which was great since we had kids. 

We ordered the calamari, Beef dip sandwich and  the chicken parm sandwich. Ofcourse, we ended with the white chocolate brownie! All of this was amazing. The calamari had this amazing garnish on it with the spicy mayo sauce. Yum. Both the sandwiches were very flavourful and filling. Despite my being full I ordered the brownie, because lets face it, its a waste to go there and not get the brownie. It was as I remembered, ahhmazing!!!!"}
{"text":"The food is ok here but a little pricey for what you get.  The appeal of this place is the pretty waitresses.  So if you're looking for great food you may wanna go elsewhere...but if you want a nice view and good atmosphere here is a place to go.

I will be back soon..."}
{"text":"Food is very very tasty, waitresses always ask if you need anything and always bring you what you ask for. The sharing apetizers, desserts are amazing and the drinks are as well. Great food but on the pricy side"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Moxie's Yorkdale. 
I ordered the honey garlic sirloin steak, medium rare. It arrived almost raw - blue rare. I sent it back and the server, Michelle, was very apologetic. Another steak came several minutes later (a fresh plate with fresh sides, even though I'd taken a bite of my first baked potato), and when I cut into it, it was cooked just slightly more than the first time. 
Michelle was horrified and took it back again, and within a minute a supervisor was at the table, offering me a free appetizer and another apology. I had a piping hot and delicious broccoli cheese soup while waiting for the third steak, which was delivered by a manager, with another apology, and was cooked perfectly. 
He and Michelle both checked back to make sure all was well, and Michelle dropped off a dessert menu and let us know we could choose a dessert on the house. Neither my partner nor I were in the mood for dessert, so I asked if my mojito could be comped instead. The bill came with the drink deducted, but before we could pay it, the manager stopped by and exchanged the bill for one with not only the free drink, but 40% off both our entrees (though my partner's pasta had been perfect). Nice! 
Obviously, having to send back a steak twice is bad, but we were treated extremely well and compensated beyond expectations. Thumbs-up."}
{"text":"So, this time I went with a group of 9 friends WITH reservations.... weird place...

Anyways, food was alright. I ordered a the Cajun chicken dish. Very little avocado salad and the chicken seemed a little too tough and dry. Food was definitely not as good as last time. Service was prompt as always."}
{"text":"Went for dinner and drinks with friends.

Food was absolutely disgusting!!! I work in the industry and have reasonable expectations, but it was just plain awful. 

Drinks were good, so not complains on that.

The worst part was that it is filled with half naked waitresses that flirt with older corporate man. ..so degrading.
We felt extremely uncomfortable by looking at client GRABBING & RUBBING waitress lower back and....other parts, while she seemed quite pleased with it. 

Overall feel of a cheap strip bar and not a restaurant downtown."}
{"text":"My husband and I are from California, but were in Mississauga for a wedding. Our flight flew in late and by the time we got to our hotel we were hungry. Moxie's happened to be right across the street from where we were staying, so we decided to eat there. 

By far, one of the BEST steak dinners we've ever had! Both of our steaks were cooked perfectly and they cut like butter! The garlic mashed potatoes and veggies were so good! Our waitress was incredibly friendly and welcoming once we told her we were from the states. I wish we had a Moxie's here in California!!"}
{"text":"Food wasn't great. It was cold and chicken was burnt. 2 stars belongs to the server who was pleasant and nice. IMPORTANT REMINDER: before you pay make sure to check the breakdown of your bill. It was too late when I realized that they double charged me for one of the order. I do not know if they actually do it on purpose or what. Just be mindful on that. Food sucks but customer service was not bad. Though we waited for more than an hour."}
{"text":"Overall given the price i was expecting better food and service"}
{"text":"First time at this location. We arrived just a little after 8:30 and thought we would be waiting in the lobby for a while. To our surprise the place was dead for a Friday night. We were seated right away! But glee faded quick because we waited close to 15 minutes for a waitress to come to the atrium to our table just to give us water, not even to take our order. The bf was getting so angry that he went to the front to grab someone. POOR SERVICE. When I finally managed to hold a waitress' eye (gave her the stink eye because that's how pissed off and hungry I was) she apologized and gave an explanation of \"they switched the sections and didn't tell anyone\". Really??? The manager kept walking around our section at least 5 times, and half of those times it was to talk to staff. I understand a place can be hectic, but it was dead! These guys need to get it together. As for the food, it was OK for Moxie's standard. I had the Mango Chipotle Chicken and he had Lemon Pepper Haddock. The mango slices were a great touch and the asparagus were really yummy. Rice was mushy and the chicken had a really weird texture. The avocado salsa was OK and the beets were gross. The bf was not impressed with his meal either. He said he could have made a better version himself and I have to agree. Too bad. And the surroundings weren't any better. The atrium was very pretty. The stonework walls and fireplace w/ the hanging plans on the roof was a nice touch. Would have been perfect too if only the table we were seated in was cleaned up. You could tell kids were there before us because there were crayon marks on the table, one cutlery set was missing, and ripped up pieces of paper and crap on the floor. Not to mention the bf's seat was dirty. We had such a great experience at Macleod location and there was such high expectations for this one. Safe to say we will not be visiting there anytime soon. What a let down."}
{"text":"I have been here twice since it opened. Both times on a Saturday. The decor follows the Moxie's Formula to a tee. In each case I sat at the bar for my meal. The first time was their Blackened New York which was done perfectly. The second time it was a pasta dish with sausage and mushrooms. It was also very good. 

The staff are friendly and attentiive. Even though I had only been there once before the bartender remembered which wine I had.

Also around the bar there are numerous TV sets which were tuned to the various sports events that we being played."}
{"text":"I see I'm not the only one with a bad experience!  Went in today at 2pm for lunch.  Ushered into the lounge.  Ordered a diet coke and sandwich and fries.  Diet coke came out, no problem.  Sandwich was delayed.  Then it was cold.  No forks or knives.  Bar tender made some irreverent comment when I had to get up and ask him for fork and knife.  When waitress came back, I said I was finished with meal due to it being cold.  She compped the meal, charged me for diet coke and was rude.  
Won't be going back there.  I've had better meals in the food court.
If anyone knows of any good restaurants in NW Calgary, let me know.  The bar is pretty darn low for anything!
It's too bad....this Moxie's used to be REALLY good....a long long time ago....
With the economy the way it is, these poor restaurants just won't survive.  People will vote with their feet."}
{"text":"It's a great environment to have a drink and a chat with friends but it's pretty dead if you are looking to socialize. As for the food it's okay and the drinks they are a bit cheap with the amount of alcohol but I actually prefer that. 
If you're looking for a low key place to chat with friends and have a little drink this is perfect. But if your looking to party, socialize, or have a stiff drink I'd suggest going else where."}
{"text":"Mixed feelings about this place.  Good meet up spot with fair drink prices.  Great, friendly service.  Had the steak salad for about $19 Canadian.  I could hardly find the steak.  Also, ordered it medium rare and it was more.like medium well.  The food is PRICEY!  Finally,  not enough light on the patio.  Can't see what you're  eating or who is here.  Please get some inexpensive,  artificial candles.  You are so close to 4 stars!!!!"}
{"text":"My friend and I have gone to this location a few times on a Saturday or Sunday for brunch. The last time it took 5 minutes for the hostess to come and seat us. We were just about to leave when she finally appeared. They were not busy so that wasn't the problem. Unfortunately this has a happened a few times. The food was ok but why are the servers dressed in super short skirts and low cut tops. It's really inappropriate and uncalled  for in a family restaurant. We saw way more than we wanted to! Will think twice before going again."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my fav restaurants especially in a ghetto place like Scarborough. The food is amazing, the staff is so friendly and polite. I'm always seated at a good seat and the food is AMAZING. Definitely try the Parmesan and prosciutto chicken sandwich..It's a customer favourite!! The guys working here are very easy on the eyes which is always a plus. You gotta check this place out. You won`t be disappointed!"}
{"text":"After hearing wonderful things about the white chocolate brownie I decided to go to moxie's with a couple of friends to try out the food. The food nothing to rave about. It was okay but that's it. The service was really nice. Our waitress waited for all of our party to arrive was very patient and accommodating. The food arrived on time. The white chocolate brownie was really good though, not gonna lie. However, I would recommend a bit size because that thing was huge and it was split between my friend and I, and we still didn't finish it. Otherwise okay, but I felt the food was definitely on the pricey side."}
{"text":"I have been to Moxy'S before and I have to say I would never go again. We planned a large party and were told that we would get a discount due to set menus. When we got the bill it was full price and more!!! If we payed full price why set menus with a little option I for one want a normal menu!! Second the management outright lied to get the group!! I would never go again and I will tell everyone this. They try to give us three deserts per table to make things better which also meant they knew they were wrong!!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Had to ask for cutlery. The server brought me a glass of water and after drinking it, she just took the glass and never offered more water. Eventually had to ask for another water. Ordered the calamari and it was bland and tasteless. Their menu is lacking many options. Every time I have been there it was practically dead inside yet the servers are too busy to serve you. I think they prefer to stand around and chat. If you're in the area I'd advise going to milestones instead."}
{"text":"the service is very slow even sitting in the bar area. Today I left after waiting for 15 mins just for A DRINK that never came. Next time I will head to Milestone or Jack Astors."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food and service here.  Lots of room for big groups, server was great, and food came out very fast.  Everyone enjoyed their meal, and I expect we'll be back soon."}
{"text":"One of my favorite bar and grill. Busy resturant, but worth waitting. Love their peach bellini."}
{"text":"The food at Moxie's is great I don't have any issues there, I would give 5* if it would be only about the food.
On the other hand, due to the service I am giving them only 2*.  This is the 3rd time I am at the Pickering location  and in no way or form  it is a match to the Sheppard Location.  Some of the waitresses have big attitudes and seem to be rushing or not listening at you."}
{"text":"I've witnessed two horrible incidences at this location. This first incident happened about 4 weeks ago. My coworker ordered a vegetarian lettuce wraps , except her meal was served chicken. She didn't realize it was chicken until a couple of bites into her meal. They did act quickly to fix the problem, but honestly this problem should never have happened in the first place. The second incident occurred just this past Monday, when a friend ordered the open steak sandwich. She realized after a bite or two that the chef had forgot to remove cardboard from the bread and so she was eating the cardboard. That was also really unacceptable - even though they attempted to make both mistakes right, it shows a bigger and more systemic problem in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Really terrible experience in every way:

Bruschetta was horrible and \"do it yourself\" - which I have never seen 
done that way...looked like the kitchen was being lazy.

Hot tea ordered was only slightly warn.

My steak was good but baked potato was horrid. My wife ordered a Salad and Calamari but forgot to ask for Tabasco (which she won't eat without) sadly the server never returned to the table (and we were unable to locate any other staff). I had already finished my steak so I gave up wanting the Steak sauce...in the end my wife took the calamari home to eat there (with OUR Tabasco lol)

Considering the fancy front greeting area with the attractive hostesses, the restaurant and staff didn't impress me.  Definitely wasn't worth the 80$ I spent there.  There were/are better options just outside the mall...use them."}
{"text":"I arrived around 430pm and place had a light crowd.  Was greeted with a very friendly face and smile.  Offered the bar or dining, I opted for the bar sitting area.  It was very comfortable.  I order starter house salad and the greens were very crisp and fresh, entire salad was well presented and tasted great.  Main course was the chipotle mango chicken and it was one of the best meals I've had in all my trips to Canada.  It was tender and had just enough kick.  I have to also agree with previous post to ignore the negative posts and try this place, you'll be surprised and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Second time coming here.

Worst. Customer. Service. Ever

Get there, the host was too busy talking to another girl for a few minutes, so me and my boyfriend just stood there awkwardly. She asked how many people, i said two. She said 10 minute wait. HAH! What a joke. I waited for literally 30 minutes. When it was our turn to get called up, the couple before us made a scene and took our place because they were there first (i don't really blame them, i'd be pissed off too if i waited 40 minutes only to have someone who came after me take our place).

So once again me and my bf stood there awkwardly with NO apology from the hostess who screwed up.

We get called up again, and once again, they messed up! And so we stand awkwardly again.. After me rolling my eyes and giving her the stink eye she apologized.

Now onto the food. Ordered the brushetta, that was amazing, as usual. 

For our mains, I had the burger with cheese and bacon added on. Fries were COLD, COLD COLD COLD!! But the burger was good.

boyfriend got the herbed grill chicken. By far the best chicken i've ever had, the white sauce they put on tastes strong though, something you have to get used too. He just scrapped the sauce off. But overall it was alright.

Manager was helping serve dishes, so i asked her for mayo and ketchup, she said sure. And i'm pretty sure she forgot about it.. what kind of manager does that?

Anyways overall

The waitresses are dressed as if they're going clubbing, and look like it too. Make up is packed on, heavy.

I feel like i'm at hooters. Probably get better customer service there too.

What is up with their cold fries? That's something i've noticed each time i've been to movies.

Overall food 3/5
Service 1/5"}
{"text":"I'm just not all that interested in seeing all those boobs and legs etc while I dine.  I observed some couples on dates, and the men didn't know where to look, lol, it was totally hilarious!  My friends and I refer to it as an Upscale Hooters :).  I would also prefer the same caliber of male servers to be equally hot as the women, I'm not impressed with the guys at all, lol.

I do enjoy the drinks and appetizers."}
{"text":"Moxie's is Moxie's, there isn't much more to say about it. It isn't the most lavish or extraordinary place to go, but it's you're average restaurant serving an assortment of standard food. The design and colours are mellow and make it a good place to just hang out, eat, drink, and talk (although sometimes the music is too loud for talking). 

Like any Moxie's, the hostesses show more skin than is necessary. The service has never been below par, nor has the quality of food. Their White Peach Bellini is also worth Moxie sizing! 

The size of the restaurant is good so seating shouldn't be limited, but sometimes it is and requires a long wait, particularly if you have a large party. Can they be blamed? No, their location is right by a mall, close to a train station, and just off a major road. Plus it just goes to show how popular this place is, and there's a reason for it. The downer to this location: absolutely tiny parking lot, and you're not supposed to go to one of the parking places for near by business, so make sure you car pool!"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about this place. The bartender was amazing and she made possibly the best Old Fashioned I've ever had. Also, the fried chicken sandwich is surprisingly yummy! I think it's something new on their menu, but I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I visited with a group and ordered fish tacos. I had informed my server that I have a severe tomato allergy and a manager even came out to speak to me about precautions they would take to prevent tomatoes from contacting me food. Then my tacos came with salsa, they professionally handled the situation and very quickly fixed my meal. I would highly recommend this restaurant for their kind service and especially for individuals with allergies."}
{"text":"If you are in Pickering you MUST visit this Moxie's. It's the best one I've been to.  Exceptional customer service here. They went above and beyond. Our server Tazer was not only friendly but she was funny and her recommendations were perfect. The manager Mike met us and solidified our future visits to this location."}
{"text":"Great environment and classy restaurant. Service was good. Food quality is okay, could be better for the price. Staff were all friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Was staying at the nearby Marriott Toronto Airport for work and after long hours each day visiting the various locations that I had to drive to - I opted to come here for dinner on my last night.

Upon arrival, I spotted a high top at the bar area and sat down. The previous guest had already left so I sat myself down. A number of servers were working the bar area and two of them were gossiping about an upcoming date that one was going to have. No one who was working the tables in the bar area noticed me and after waiting 11 minutes (yes I did time it) - I finally asked a server that I wanted to order. She apologized thinking that I was with that previous party but the only thing on that high top was a soiled napkin and a dirty side plate! Duhhh??? A menu was produced and after looking at I had decided within a minute what I wanted and then placed the menu face down on the table.  Once again, I had to wait and wait and wait to the point that I said \"s***w\" this and moved to the bar where I knew I would get served immediately and that is exactly what happened. I would have left the restaurant all together but I was tired and did not want to drive to another restaurant.

To the management of Moxie's on Reading Court:  just because there are a lot of out of towners who frequent your restaurant does not give your staff the right to treat us with bad service. The female servers may be young and eye candy but they need a basic ABC's on service standards!  End of story!"}
{"text":"Recently my friends and I decided to get together and just meet up for desert. Our debate was between Moxie's or Earl's, and my search online showed Moxie's has a larger selection of deserts so I thought that might be more worth while. Then the debate was between this location or Southport, and we chose here since it was more central for us. First, I didn't even realize this location existed at all until I looked for it on Google, and I realized I have actually driven past it a number of times and never noticed. Maybe a bad location? But they do have a large parking lot which makes them better than Southport.

So anyways, my friends and I went here at 8:30, we were worried it might be busy but it was not. We decide to sit in the lounge for fun even though we weren't planning to drink. Our waitress seemed friendly and talkative with other tables, except us. I don't think she liked the fact we weren't getting drinks, and that we only wanted desert and not a full meal, but that still is no reason to be short and rude to paying customers. My friends and I are quite polite, we say please and thanks, and we don't do or ask for things if we think it will inconvenience our server. It really made no sense why were were getting attitude. 

Beyond the fact that the service sucked and I will either not go back, or not sit in the lounge, the place was ok. In regards to desert: I had the taster trio where it was a toffie cake I think, a chocolate mousse, and the white chocolate brownie. The cake was pretty good, the mousse was wonderful, and the brownie a little disappointing. I remember back in the days when I went to Moxies a lot I was obsessed with the brownie, but I found it looked and tasted like cheap boxed cake mix with some other things thrown in. The decor was mellow, the patio looked quaint and nice, the seating was comfortable, but the music was way too loud."}
{"text":"I would give you a review of the food, but we never made it that far.

We were seated right away, restaurant wasn't that busy. We waited 15 minutes no service. We asked a busboy to get our waitress. He said she would be right there. Another 15 minutes passed. So after half an hour not even a glass of water.

We got up left, and told the girl at the front we had waited half an hour, and no service. She said if we took a seat someone would help us right away. We were not going to take that chance.

Horribly disorganized. 

Stay away."}
{"text":"I give this a 3 out of 5 star experiance.  Met up with a friend there for drinks and food. The service was slow and not friendly. I ordered the chicken and ribs dinner. The chicken was good, but the ribs were under-cooked. A little over-priced too."}
{"text":"Beautiful ambience. Sat at the bar and served by a stunning blonde + fireplaces, cool lighting and more beautiful servers. 
- eye candy = check 
- started with the \"poke (tuna) in a jar\" appetizer which is a 10/10 must order 
- main was a southern chicken sandwich which was also awesome 
- washed down with some pints of Guinness ... awesome meal. 
* definitely coming back"}
{"text":"I went to this location the other night and had a bite to eat with a couple of friends. The food was just OK. The portions were small and it looked like there was something missing from the plate. The salted caramel cheesecake was tasty but not enough of it for the price. The waitress was great!!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere isn't bad, as long as you like loud music while your eating.  I've been to this location several times and I've noticed the quality of food has really gone down, and I'm not all that impressed with the service any more either. 

For the same money, or even less.....lots of better choices out there."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant after an event, had the best steak in a really long time!! I have tried steak at a lot of restaurant but its hard to get the perfect taste. Would definitely recommend to steak lovers"}
{"text":"Went here for some drinks on a Friday night with a girlfriend after a long, long hiatus from Moxie's thinking \"maybe it's better now\"... It was just ok. Our server was very friendly and answered all our questions. Be forewarned, the service is very slow. It took forever to get our drinks and then our water. By the time our apps came around we had been waiting for about 25 mins. The food was just average. I'll probably be on another long hiatus now."}
{"text":"Food is ok. Beware of big groups since gratuity is 18% after tax. Service is below par - they didnt even refill water for the table. Lunch menu options are limited. Ordered the steak sandwiches... someone received \"well done\" instead of \"medium rare\"."}
{"text":"Friendly and warm setting and a great seating arrangement with a girls night out a round table. Drinks were good and then things changed. the resto was short staffed and so we waited quite a bit to order our food and receive it. The red curry bowl is not what it used to be for those who have loved it for years. More oily, lacks the red curry coconut flavour, and thr cinnamon dusted bread it came with is no longer.The calamari was greasy but the burgers looked good.
We had to fetch our waitress to check in on us. Then we had to get out of our seat to ask for water. 
The company of good friends distracted us from the lag time between courses and the manager on call for the evening was nice to check in. 

I'm sorry you are short staffed during the dinner hour, but letting your patrons know ahead of time is better to avoid frustration and allows for more patience on their part."}
{"text":"Had the shrimp and crab linguini and was enjoying till I found a hair in my food! Disgusting!"}
{"text":"three words: White. Chocolate. Brownie.

Oh hot damn that is the finest dessert I've had the pleasure of introducing to my mouth. If Moxie's had nothing else going for it, I'd probably still give it a 5-stars, but lucky for you night owls, there's more. 

The location is right off of the 401, on Hurontario, smack between Mississauga and Brampton: they couldn't have chosen a better spot. It's not in the same area as the other sit-down places or the movie theater complex, so it has this ...snooty/superior air to it ...I kinda like it. 

The food is very solid; it is NOT mind blowing ...if you're going to chain restaurants for mind-blowing food, maybe you should re-consider some things in life. In terms of chain restaurants though, Moxie's has really good food. Their salmon with mashes potatoes + crispy onions: delicious and so flavorful! 

The ambiance in Moxie's is very chic: mood lighting + having just the right amount of darkness can make this place seem super cozy (fantastic for dates!!). The waiters here are what really push this location to new heights. My wife and I have great rapport with a few of  the waiters and they know what our regular, so we're always asked: \"just the dessert menu again?\"

TL:DR: great location, great food (for a chain restaurant), great staff, mind blowing dessert!"}
{"text":"I can't give a review lower than 1, so stuck with that. Went here with my parents in town, expecting above Food Court quality. Sadly very badly disappointed!! We had litter under our table. We had to return the glasses twice because they were unwashed!!! The server did not know even half the things about any food item on the menu. Our basic requests were lost on her. These server kept banging things on the table and not heading to the requests. The unhygienic serving and careless hostess left us with an uneasy lunch experience. A food court would have been better. Our overall experience was horrid and we left with a big bill and even bigger annoyance! Don't go here if you aim to enjoy a meal with some decent hospitality. Big disappointment"}
{"text":"Moxie's is a place you go with a group of people to hang out and have a good time, since it has a good atmosphere for the under 40 crowd. It is pretty dark, loud music and has modern earthy decor with some classic twists. Do not come here looking for good food especially if you are vegetarian. If you eat meat, get the enchiladas those are actually quite good though very heavy. I tried the portobello naan panini the last time, though it was decent, it was not good enough to order a second time for me. Drink menu is pretty decent here and they usually have a special of the day. Waiters and service is almost always left to be desired, and if you are a girl I don't think most of the waitresses dressed in really revealing clothing is very tasteful. Just a warning, this place does not take reservations on Fridays and Saturdays, so space out your time accordingly, I have waited 1.5 hours to get a table here with other people on a Friday night. If it were me, I probably would never choose to come here, but it is a very popular option in my social circles."}
{"text":"By far the best restaurant experience I've had in a long time. And to top it off the steak I had (Honey Garlic Sirloin) was one of the best I've had too, right up there with the quality of The Keg's easily! Cooked to perfection. 
The staff enjoyed our company and thoughts so much that the manager gave us our appetizer on the house. Extremely nice professional touch that will have us coming back for more. 
I absolutely recommend this establishment or any of the other Moxies to anyone who hasn't been. Prices are fairly reasonable for the quality of the food you receive."}
{"text":"I guess we went at a bad time because eating here was not a great experience. We arrived at 11 AM on a holiday and were told there was not a brunch menu, only a lunch menu. The lunch menu had numerous items in the $20 plus range so 4 of us decided  on the soup and sandwich special (soup and a 1/2 beef dip or turkey sandwich) or the beef dip. When the waitress came back she said \"oh sorry, we have no beef dip. Gee, it would have been nice to have been told this before we decided on what to order! 
I ordered a burger that came out burnt and a side of gravy for the fries. The gravy came out in a thimble cup, not nearly enough. I barely ate half of what came out because it was so bad.
Overpriced poor food!


















menu had numerous items in tbe $25 range"}
{"text":"They did not have bottled mineral water and said their machine was broken when it was requested. The salmon was grilled perfectly but the mushroom salsa it was crusted with was overpowering. The fries that came with my wife's meal were frozen. for the price I would have expected fresh cut.

The Moxie's Coffee first arrived as a cup of coffee with a shot of Baileys on the side. when they returned with the \"corrected\" version, it was a cup of coffee with whipped cream and a shot of Baileys and Frangelica combined on the side.

The server and staff were pleasant enough but that did not make up for the mistakes. I would and do expect better for the price. 

the 2 stars I am giving this is generous. I will not be back!"}
{"text":"I went here a few days ago and was completely unimpressed. I've been here a couple times and even for my birthday last year but the food has gone downhill. I'm also disappointed because the  prices are also higher than I last remembered them to be.  

The pasta (penne) was all bunched together when I ordered it and the veggie burger was not as good as I remembered it to be.

I don't think I'll be making a return anytime soon."}
{"text":"Three words:

Sweet potato fries.

Seriously, I don't know how they do it, but this place has some of the best sweet potato fries I've ever had!  Just the right thickness, the have a very thin, crispy outside that nearly shatters when you bite. Inside it's all soft, sweet, starchy goodness.  They're light and greaseless and perfectly fried. I know, I know, sweet potato fries are always good, right?  Sure, but Moxie's somehow raises them to a new level.

The menu is what you'd expect from a fancier bar-and-grill/gastropub kind of place, but everything we've had from it has been good.  Great burgers and the almond-crusted salmon comes with a delicious lemon and leek cream sauce.  

Prices are quite reasonable for what you get, and the service is very friendly and attentive.  The space is sort of cavernous, and the tables at the booths are inexplicably high (or are the benches inexplicably low?  I can't tell!)  But don't worry, as long as you order the sweet potato fries, you'll be so happy and distracted, you won't even notice that the table is practically at your chin :)"}
{"text":"Honestly when I think Moxie's I think girls with short black shirts and low cut tops, high heals and long dangling necklaces that fall just in the right spot... and truly that's why I boycotted it for a while. But I had lunch there today with a group of friends and was presently surprised, mind you we did sit in the dinning area as opposed to the bar...
I got the chicken parm with prosciutto sandwich and sweet potato fries, must say it was delicious! FYI- If you're getting a dish that comes with fries get the sweet potato fries they are to die for, and the garlic aioli is an awesome plus! A few people at my table of 12 weren't satisfied and we did send a Chicago steak back to the kitchen... But all in all not too shabby! And we did a pretty good job as we only had 1 doggy bag.
Our waitress was nice, a tad clumsy as she dropped quite a few things when clearing, but nice and hey I can understand when busy. It wouldn't hurt them to invest in pitchers, it would benefit them as constant carrying of water glasses to our table seemed to be time consuming... Think about it 12 people 2-3 glasses each...
Randomness: I actually liked looking at the ceiling in the dinning area it's interesting how it's broken up and the design elements match the 5-6 different light fixtures in the space... Just something I noticed."}
{"text":"No vegan options besides salad. Someone should let them know it's 2013."}
{"text":"This place has good food, but it is a little over-priced for what you get.
Service is always good, washrooms are always spotless, and I like how they have been making changes to the menu lately.

I've had the Beef Vindaloo (very good) The Roast Beef Dip (also very good) Burgers (okay, but nothing to write home about) and some other dishes that were pretty good.

Good place to go with co-workers for lunch, or a date after work."}
{"text":"Well-when the other choices at Yorkdale are Milestone's, Pickle Barrel or Rainforest Cafe, you figure Moxie's at least sounds cool. 

So we had the loaded burger, and the chicken burger.  Loaded burger was greasy, pretty decent, and quite filling.  The chicken in the chicken burger, however, is that weird spongy, fake chicken.  Gross.  Hate that type of chicken by product.

We also shared an app platter, and the best thing on there was the dips for the breads.  Nothing was introduced to us, so we still don't know what the dip was called.  Guacamole spring rolls were too greasy, and almost burnt, but the wings were good as were the chicken fingers.  

So yeah, all in all, we got what we expected.  I figure, don't go in with crazy expectations when you're eating at a mall, and you won't be too let down. 

Next time, Rainforest...*shudder*."}
{"text":"I ordered the peanut noodles and my boyfriend got the lamb medallions. My noodles were not good at all actually pretty gross, they tasted and looked like they were drowned in peanut butter. No other flavour but peanut butter and an off sour taste. The lamb was not a medallion, they were pounded out and flat. And for almost 30$ the portion was very small, along with 3 pieces of sad vegetables and flavourless quinoa. We sucked it up and ate as much as we could because we waited 50 mins for the two mains and our movie was starting soon. No appetizers before. Overpriced, disappointing food. SAD! :("}
{"text":"Had breakfast, lunch and dinner here during my last trip to Toronto.  The restaurant was attached to the hotel where I stayed.  What can I say?!  You can't beat the convenience of an in-house restaurant.  But I was amazed at the number of locals who obviously just came to eat.  It was that good!  Service was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Love the food, and the place has a calm relaxing atmosphere. We''ve been there last weekend and the only thing I have to admit is a slow service, I was trying to catch the waitress for 20 min and finally went to find her by myself"}
{"text":"We visited for a family dinner w/3 kids, Mom & Dad. The staff were very attentive to the whole family including the kids. Kids meals were just right  . One kid had a nice burger, and the other had chik fingers ... both had a fun presentation. Mom had the linguine fresca w/sweet chik sausage. Dad had Barramundi w/shrimp. The creamy coconut sauce made the dish! Big bro (we're you counting) had the beef vindaloo. It was a great dish but maybe a little spicy for a first try at \"Indian\" food. The naan was fresh and good. We each tried different desserts. Kids \"volcano\" sundae presented with smoky dry ice (Fun!) and the Xango, the white brownie, and the chocolate cadlebout (?) cake were delish!

Servers & service was warm, attentive, and fun!"}
{"text":"Never was a big fan of Moxie's (quality of food and service differs WAY to much in this chain restaurant). i've had horrible experiences before. Things seem to blow up when it gets busy. This time, I must say, was extremely normal (which may be good or bad). 

The server was really friendly and honest. punched in orders and got us watered quickly. 

tried the Scallop and Crab Cake Benedict (from their brunch menu), Broccoli and cheddar soup, and Veal stuffed with bonoccini. 

soup was ok - they didn't bring any crackers to go with it though. (it was a cream based soup but i guess it'd be nice to have the option to put crackers in:) )

crab cake benedict was really filling - i had 1/2 and felt really stuffed. (Crab cakes here are better than the ones at The Fishhouse, for people who have read my review of that place) ; their hashbrowns were good as well (crispy w/ the right amount of flavour)

Veal stuffed with bonocini wasn't really anything special. by the time i was eating that, i was already kind of full. I'm actually having that for leftover dinner (hashbrowns + veal spaghetti is actually not a bad combination in case anyone was wondering :P)

Verdict: Food wasn't spectacular, service was good; but i wouldn't come back as a first choice (just because I've been burned before with this place)"}
{"text":"My girls took me out to dinner here for my birthday a while ago and I had a pretty good experience. I've been to Moxie's a few times before, but if you know me, I usually steer away from chains whenever I have the chance. That said, the décor is nice and classy.

If you're going to come here for drinks and dessert, I'd give it four stars, but if you're going to come here for dinner, I would say...... MEH, three stars max. I'm never impressed with their meals, in fact if anything I find myself getting something smaller and rushing to finish it so I can get to dessert.  

Their white chocolate brownie is heavenly! The Sticky Toffee Pudding and Blackberry Apple Crisp are also delicious, get all three with French Vanilla Ice Cream and you're game."}
{"text":"Great for drinks with the guys in an upscale spot. But the food was pretty subpar for the rest of the place. The chicken appetizer was pretty good though."}
{"text":"Beautiful interior. Love the white chocolate brownie and the classic beef burger. I'd definitely go there again."}
{"text":"Went there on Thursday for dinner with a group of friends.
The food was good, everyone enjoyed it. 
I had the red thai curry and really enjoyed it.
Our waiter Alex Wong was very attentive to our table, making sure everyone always had everything they needed.
Will definitely come back to this location!"}
{"text":"The environment definitely is for friends and family to meet together.  The server is very polite and always smiling.

Bruschetta has fresh seasoned tomatoes, baby capers with extra virgin olive oil & crumbled goat cheese.  Though it has goat cheese, the smell is very light.  Together with Calamari that has popcorn shrimp, crispy jalapenos, candied ginger, sriracha aioli & sweet chili sauce are good appetizer to start.  The Nachos is fresh and crispy.

Kale and Quinoa salad with poached chicken breast, toasted sunflower seeds, dried currants & grana padano is very healthy and is good for those who are health conscious.

The New York steak though cooked to perfection for medium rare but the texture is not as comparable to sirloin.

Salmon with whole grain mustard & dill, served with fresh green beans & wild mushroom salsa over baby potatoes is well presented and the portion is quite big.

Overall, it is a restaurant that most people love to go, especially now is close to the Christmas"}
{"text":"A Tuesday business lunch at 1pm. Well greeted and seated. Waited mere moments for Chris our good-to-great server.

Specials announced and explained. Tuesdays are cheap glasses of wine days. Well sold and well served.

Pasta dish for my dining partner. \"Very good\".

My chicken/pesto/tomato focaccia sandwich with fries was a 7 out of 10. Too much olive oil and it soaked through into the focaccia. Chicken tough. Pesto was great, tomato fresh, fries crisp, not enough ketchup served in the side vessel but I can stand to eat less fries anyway.

Dessert and tea served quickly.

My dining companion was paying the bill with a credit card and asked about the percentage on the wireless handheld machine: is the pre-set on total (with tax) or pre-tax. Waiter didn't know. That should be something to find out - no harm no foul.

Great lunch overall"}
{"text":"God forbid if you have to eat here on your lunch break and only have limited time.  Went here today and asked if they could seat 4 of us.  Hostess looked at us with a blank stare.  I asked her if they had seating for 4.  She said NO.  I asked her how long a wait it would be.  She said \"I have No Idea\".  We said well go elsewhere.  Food is good but it's get a 1 star on customer service."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Moxies in a long while.  My Hubby and I decided to grab a bite to eat here before getting together with friends.  This place has great decor, very modern and dim.  We sat in the lounge, which has huge booths, along with numerous tables.  Our server came right away and took our drink order, you could \"Moxie\" size for another dollar, so I got a moxie sized Bellini.  we waited a while for our drinks, she came and apologized and took our food order.  I got the Thai chicken salad, with the dressing on the side.  Eventually our drinks came and I thoroughly enjoyed my yummy Bellini!   We didn't wait long for our food, maybe 20 minutes.  My salad was a good mix of greens with noodles, the dressing was nice and zesty, the chicken grilled well and tasty.  It was a perfect meal, nice and filling.  Our bill came to $50 with a couple drinks and our meals, pretty standard.

I love the lounge in this Moxies, they have great drinks and their menu has a good variety.  It highly recommend checking it out!"}
{"text":"Food didn't really leave an impression, a bit bland. The setting was nice, not too crowded but a little dim. Waited a long time to be seated on a weekday night though."}
{"text":"Here's a place that used to be much better than it is now. Anyone that has been to Moxie's knows that it had a great bar and varied foods. 

For drinks.. They make my favourite Caesar and the wine, although  a bit pricey, has a good selection. 

The food has been lacking a bit over the last 2 years. It seems like they aren't making items fresh in the back.. But I am no expert to confirm that. 

Still a great hangout."}
{"text":"Good service but not the best food in the area.

They advertise as a premium restaurant with great service , warm atmosphere and great food.  This is located near the airport and during the week will attract business travellers (mostly men) and can create a warm vibrant environment.  In the bar area (dimly lit) you will found TVs and patrons chatting away.  It is great if you are dining as a group or by yourself.   The wait staff provides good service and do their best to look good and service with a smile.  

I think this is all I would visit this moxie location for.  I don't recall having a good meal here.  This trip I ordered their sirloin with lobster and shrimp butter.  When my entree arrived, cold butter on a warm steak is not a good combination.  I almost ask the server to take it back and re-fire the butter but was worry that they over cook the sirloin.  But as a cut into the steak, it wouldn't have matter, the cut was so bad that my jaw got a good work out tonight .   I do have to say the bed of spinach, corn and sausage was nice and was the real hero on the plate. 

I would recommend coming for appetizer and drinks but go elsewhere for dinner."}
{"text":"My Wife and I had a remarkable anniversary dinner here last night. I had told the hostess upon making the reservation it was our anniversary and the server immediately acknowledged this and offered a bottle of champagne to celebrate. My wife does not like champagne so the server offered a bottle of house wine. We accepted and the wine was very good. The food was good and the room warm and inviting if not different from the other Moxies I have visited. Overall one of the best visits to a chain restaurant I have ever enjoyed."}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday night, so it was not busy whatsoever. I believe there were only 4 tables in use including ours.
The hostess was less than hospitable and friendly, she just pointed at the table we were sitting at rather than leading us to it.
We were a group of 6 by the time all had arrived, but we each trickled in one by one.
Our server failed to introduce herself to anyone at our party, as well as did not come over for drink offerings as soon as new people had arrived, rather she was hiding somewhere in the back.
I had a total of two drinks during my meal, which was about 2 hours long. I first ordered a Hawaiian Hunny, which was only O.K. The only other time I was able to get another drink, which ended up being tap water, was when I was able to ask the manager who ran our food to our table.
I ordered the Maderia Rigatoni. It was a decent dish, but you do not get a very big portion for the money. Their menu is very confusing to me, it seems to not have any flow or theme to it. No one in my party especially liked their food.
Two of the ladies at my party asked for their bills as they had to leave. Instead of the server giving only them their bills and offering the rest of us dessert menus, she printed all of our bills and brought the debit machine. Giving us no time to get dessert, even though I was prepared to buy it. She was rushing us out for no reason, as she only had 2 other tables by the time we had finished. My final cheque could've easily been another $20-$30 if the server had done proper rounds and offerings -- and I probably would've tipped her better.
In conclusion, service was lazy and lacking what you'd expect for decent service; food and drinks were only O.K. I've had better service at resturants who are not trying to be in competition with local businesses and other competing chain resturants. I will likey not return to Moxie's again."}
{"text":"Décor: ultra modern
Service: pretty ok
Knowledge on Wine list: nodda
Wine taste: barely a drop & yuck.
Price: pretty steep, considering
Food: friend had burger & said it was frozen
My friend got medium steak, which was pretty good: pink in center.  I ordered the same: no pink = tough.
Go Back: No"}
{"text":"Awesome food and service. Tried some new menu items tonight and Moxies knocked it out of the park!

I come to this Moxie's often and it's always good. Great choice for a casual dinner. They had absolut vodkas on special tonight doubles and for six bucks. 

I'll see you soon Moxies!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our server tonight usually dont do reviews but on the patio for a couple of hours with the boys. Our waitress was amazing. Food was good but the 5 stars is for the service."}
{"text":"I accidentally reviewed the wrong address, Visited this store with my Wife after a recent movie in the same parking lot. This new modern restaurant looks fanastic, the food was also very good and we are going back Saturday night.  If you get a chance do not forget to order the White Chocolate Brownie."}
{"text":"Great experience at this location! I come here with my friends from work for drinks and the bartenders are very nice. Kind of slow at times, but its understandable when the restaurant is packed on a weekend. On a separate note, I wish they had some better deserts but overall great experience. I will continue coming here."}
{"text":"Great location but the service is absolutely terrible. We waited 30 minutes to get a table. A waitress came along and offered us drinks. After she left, another waitress came along to say that she would be serving us. We told her that we were already being served. She apologized and went away. She came back 5 minutes later to say that there was a mixup and that she would be serving us. 10 minutes in and we were without the drinks we ordered. We ordered an appetizer and the waitress left us. She came back 10 minutes later to ask if we wanted to order our mains. No appetizer. After 20 minutes of waiting for the appetizer, the waitress came back and told us that the mains were ready and that there was a problem in the kitchen resulting in the appetizer coming after the mains. The Penne Toscana was too salty. I have to admit that the bruschetta was very tasty. 
Simply not worth the time or the money. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"My wife is Celiac and so is on a stringent gluten-free diet. Moxie's has a separate menu for gluten-free food, and with confidence she ordered from that menu. A reaction to gluten, for my wife, takes around 4 hours, so it doesn't happen while we are still dining.

The food was excellent, and the manager was very attentive, but unfortunately, my wife had a gluten reaction after we arrived home. She had had nothing to eat in the hours leading up to the meal at Moxie's, so we are certain the gluten contamination occurred there."}
{"text":"A great place for after work beers. They have a rotating Craft beer tap with excellent local craft Brew to check out !! Mikey p behind the bar will definitely entertain you with his great puns"}
{"text":"The food was ok. Waiter was slow and made excuses that they were short on staff. Tried getting wing special, had my son so we couldn't sit in the bar. Waiter had manager come to say that they couldn't do it.  All you could smell was his last cigarette. The service was slow, food portions were small. Will not ever go back."}
{"text":"It's hard to say that you don't like Moxie's.  It's the chain where we all went when we were in high school (at least at my high school) because Moxie's was the least expensive restaurant that didn't provide a toy with your meal. 
But, honestly, they have really upped their game. Their food is actually quite tasty with a very broad ranging menu (from a burger and fries to a pretty hot beef vindaloo) and the service is friendly and professional. 

It simply isn't the same place that I went to for \"punk rock Tuesdays\" and I'm okay with that."}
{"text":"I would definitely recommend getting their Herb Alfredo, it's my usual and favourite from their menu, and it costs like $14.00. 
The bread served with the pasta is too die for- perfectly seasoned & crisp."}
{"text":"This place gets 4 stars because our waiter was great. Our server was Marcel L . He had excellent customer service. Explained the menu. Helped us out. And we were a group of 4 girls so he had lots of patience with us when we were all indecisive. There was one point where he was busy but someone still had us covered and once our waiter came back he apologized where it actually seemed genuine. Which I find with customer service now a days some people in customer service could really care less.  This place doesn't get 5 stars mainly because the deserts are something I could literally find out of a frozen section at a grocery store. We ordered the white chocolate brownie and cheesecake and mini brownie bite. White chocolate brownie was stale . Literally gross. I stopped eating after 2 bites. And the mini brownie bite we assumed it was a chocolate brownie but it was the same gross white chocolate brownie. The cheesecake looked good but I didn't try it. And to go I brought my husband a piece of \" chocolate cake\" it was 9$ and I later realized it was a chocolate lava cake with a strawberry. Lava cake that looks like it came frozen from grocery store   Maybe worth 4$. Extremely disappointing desserts for Moxies. The dinner and apps were great. Server was excellent."}
{"text":"This place surprised me. Being in the basement of Yorkdale i thought it wouldnt be nice. Tried the peppercorn steak. And OMG the staff are all hot."}
{"text":"I did not get ill.  But Moxie's did nothing to respond with respect to their raw chicken ways."}
{"text":"The food is ok, but the coffee is terrible. All that effort in creating an atmosphere and they miss a crucial detail. They make their coffee with a Keurig or Verrissimo and can't make an espresso to save their lives."}
{"text":"Ate here tonight with my wife and a colleague. We were seated in a dining booth by the entrance. Service was less than stellar - it was shockingly bad considering how fancy Moxie's is made out to be. 

Our male waiter named \"W\" (ear rings, nose ring) asked us what we wanted to order for drinks. My wife's Bellini was incorrectly printed on her menu so she asked for the price to be honoured - \"W\" made it seem like it wasn't his problem - with a lot of effort he asked his manager who took a dollar off the price. 

Then when asked what came as a side order with my main course of a  blackened chicken burger - he gave a muddled high speed description that would need to be digitally slowed down to understand properly. Understanding two out of three words, I ordered a side salad with my burger. When my colleague put his order in and asked what his choices were, \"W\" replied with \"whatever I said earlier,\" with a blank unempathetic stare. The sass was just oozing out of him with every sentence. He acted as if he was the owner of the restaurant and we were patrons not worthy of his time. 

Our order arrived and was delivered by yet another rude server this time a female. When I asked her for a bottle of ketchup and a side of hot sauce she sarcastically replied \"both?\" She proceeded to lazily put pepper on my wife's salad and my colleague's and suddenly left without even asking me if I wanted some on my salad. I called her back and asked her for pepper to be put on my salad. She made one turn of the grinder and suddenly left again. I called her back once again and asked for more. She reluctantly applied more, acting like she was holding the last supply of black pepper on the planet. The same feeling of unimportance oozed out of her. 

Albeit the service, the food was quite good I'm happy to say. \"W\" came back and asked how everything was going, annoyingly we said \"good\" even though all three of us were quite annoyed by the service journey thus far. After paying our bill and asking for three waters (delivered politely by another male waiter) we chatted for a few minutes closing our night when \"W\" reappeared and quickly whisked our waters away in an effort to get us out of the restaurant even though there were no other waiting parties by the entrance. Usually waters are cleared after patrons leave, it was his way of saying \"get the heck out of my restaurant.\"

I left this brief review with the front welcoming team who were very apologetic and tried to flag down their manager who was in the lounge tending to other guests. The effort was appreciated nonetheless. 

This review would have been rated one star if it wasn't for the food. It is thus an effort to warn future patrons from attending a restaurant that hires less than experienced waiters and waitresses who go by an alternate philosophy \"the customer is not always right.\" The abysmally poor lack of employee training is quite evident. They know nothing about customer service or the value of a positive user experience."}
{"text":"Every time we are there it's a kinda of. Light disappointment. They desperately want to be an up-scale restaurant and the interior says this place should be cool, but in real it's average family restaurant with high prices. Last time we were there we got a piece of plastic wrap in 30$ steak and got only apologizes from manager, no one offered to waive the price. Meanwhile in milestones restaurant they waived the half price of our dinner just because they brought the dish late. So, we decided not to go there, but yesterday broke our rule and again disappointment - my favorite Thai curry bowl was heated up in a microwave or so, because inside it was cool and the sauce had a thin film on it. Really??? Never again. Firm this time."}
{"text":"Dined here in a group of 20-odd and the service was handled very well. Food was in the range of decent-very good, not a wide selection of drinks though."}
{"text":"Every other time I have gone to Moxie's I've never been blown away with the food. It's maybe mediocre at best? (We ended up here because the Milestone's in the mall had an hour wait time) When we sat down, our server told us the specials as we glanced over the menus. I noticed they had been updated since the last time I was there and the Asian Chopped salad peaked my interest.

Grilled chicken sat on a mixture of chopped veggies, leafy greens and crispy wonton strips, and a tasty ginger sesame dressing coated the salad. I was surprised and impressed! 

Although this hasn't fully changed my opinion on Moxie's, at least I know what I'll get next time if I come back."}
{"text":"Just fantastic service.  The food was great, then again usually is.  I usually come here a couple of times a month and it always has been above par 3.5 - 4 stars.  My last visit was late August. I noticed a huge change in a matter of minutes.  From the time we were seated to the time our server came.  Being a Vegan has it's challenges but not here.  If you make it clear of your dietary needs, they will address it...they wen't over and beyond.  Neil the manager must of come to our table 4 times to assure what he suggest was ok and if there were any issues.  I didn't even know they were capable of a full vegan dish outside of a SALAD...Well done Neil and the staff that was working that night."}
{"text":"After a poor customer service experience across the street, it was refreshing to deal with an obviously professional crew here. The prices are on the higher side but the quality of the food is worth it. You wouldn't think a beef dip or backyard burger would be much to speak of, but the taste and volume of food were exceptional. 

The restaurant has two parts; one for general audiences, as well as a considerable portion (itself split in two) set aside as a lounge. We were seated in an area that will likely be open air in the summertime, but which was sealed off with flexible wind breaking clear plastic. The heaters permanently mounted in the roof made the area surprisingly comfortable. Smart move."}
{"text":"Nothing special about this place, unless you don't find something better for the time you want, don't waste you money and time. 
P.S If you are picky about your steak, don't order it ... it will be either overcooked or uncooked!"}
{"text":"I always come to this location, even though it's not the closest to me. This is such a classy, clean and beautiful restaurant. Amazing customer service and food, leaving no room for complaints on my end. Of course they have the best nachos because of the double cheese and I love cheese. Also I strongly recommend to try my all time favourite meal here which is the chicken rigatoni."}
{"text":"If you don't want to stand in line and find a spot at after shopping at Yorkdale this is the spot! Its dark and beautiful but this location is huge compared to all the other locations. 

Food:  
Nachos:  being a fan of nachos of course their nachos were amazing but the double cheese was a little overbearing making it hard to chew on but other than that excellent. 

White chocolate Brownie:  must try, it's warn with chocolate bites in it, also chocolate syrup under the brownie, topped with French vanilla ice cream and whipped cream. Every bite is heavenly but may not finish all by yourself since the piece is huge. 

Chicken Madeira rigatoni: The chicken pieces are crispy with amazing flavour and the pasta is creamy and buttery. I ended up finishing the whole bowl surprisingly.

Penne Toscana:  The sausage is cooked just right not chewy and every bite is full of flavour. Just a tad bit too salty for me. 

White peach Bellini:  since it was a Wednesday I gave it try, only $4.99 and it was amazing. The drink tasted exactly like a peach smoothie. Although the size was small I'm definitely getting it again. 

Customer Service: The few times I came here I have always been seated right away. The servers won't disappear, they'll always be checking up on us and if they have to make a run to another table or something, they'll let us know! Excellent customer service. 

Downfall:  You will have to wait in line if you're coming here around 8ish, the place gets jam packed especially during the holiday season since everyone is coming straight down after shopping."}
{"text":"Don't eat at this roach infested restaurant. Matter of fact, the whole food court is a cockroah haven, and those creatures crawl up through the drains and comes out from the floors and sinks."}
{"text":"Moxie's isn't terrible for a chain and this particular vacation is  the best of the one's I've been to. 

The service here is great and prompt-important for downtown office worker dining. The menu is varied-definitely something for everyone and any sized appetite. The prices are reasonable and I've found anytime there is an issue with a meal or something they are quick to fix it. What I like about this Moxie's is it is reliable and you know what to expect. I've never had a terrible menu item and several things on there are very tasty. The often have interesting seasonal specials and menus as well to shake things up a bit.

The lounge upstairs is great for after work drinks or a more casual meal. The service up there is a little less \"classy\" but still acceptable. A good spot to visit with one person or a group!"}
{"text":"I was at Yorkdale shopping with a friend, and we were hungry,thirsty and had about 1 1/2 to kill, and so we decide to pop into Moxie's. Neither of us had ever been to Moxie's before, and after what we experienced, it is safe to say that neither of us will ever be returning. 

When we got there there was a line, so we approached the hostess and asked what the approximate wait would be. She said 15mins, so I gave her my name and we settled in for the wait. About 10 mins into our wait, we saw a group of teens come in, and approach the hostess. It was obvious that knew each other and were whispering to one another back and forth. Another 5 mins went by and this group of teens that had just come in were showed to their table! There was about another 15 people waiting to be seated that had been there for much longer. I overheard the waitress tell the group to hurry up before someone noticed. It must be noted that everyone that works in this restaurant seems to be 19yrs old, and I guess this is the sort of thing that happens when you have teenagers dressed is slutty outfits manning your floor. 

Anyway another 10 mins went by, and we were finally showed to our table and handed our menus. We were short on time at this point, so we ordered our drinks and apps ( as we no longer had time for actual meals) and asked for our server to bring a dessert menu with her along with our drinks, please and thank-you. 

Our drinks came out fast, and they were ok. My friend said her margarita was decent, and my sangria was meh... it tasted really watered down and was 70% ice. We saw our waitress come out with our apps (sweet potato fries and calamari) and give it to the table beside us. The girls at the table beside us looked confused and explained to her that they didn't order the apps. My friend then called over to our server and told her that in fact, those apps were what we ordered. At this point the girls on the table next to us already had their hands all over our food. 

Our server apologized, but then, tried to give us the food that was already being eaten by the table next to us. WTF!? We were pretty angry at this point, but she assured us that she'd be right back with our food in a few minutes. Finally our food came, and with it the dessert menu. The sweet potato fries were bland, and the calamari was such a ridiculously small that it looked as if most of it had been spilled on the way over. I have never seen such a small serving of calamari in my life. 

We got the tasting trio for dessert and it consisted of a a white chocolate brownie, a chocolate espresso mouse and a caramel bread pudding, and it was supposed to come with \"homemade\" chocolate biscotti. The desserts were all yummy, however our biscotti was missing in action, as was our waitress. When she finally came around, we mentioned the missing biscotti and she rolled her eyes and walked off. She later came back with the biscotti and our bill. 

I was paying with debit, and she squatted beside our table while I swiped my card, and it was at this point that she decided to talk to us, and ask us about the weather,and what our plans for the night were. It was so fake and she was so close to my face that I had to scoot back on my seat in order to somewhat maintain my personal space. It was clearly a last minute effort to get a decent tip after having offered such horrendous service all night. 

I left her the required 10%, but in all honesty all I wanted to do was speak to the manager. This was the worst dining experience I have ever had. I would only recommend this place if your idea of a good time is looking at barely legal teenage waitresses dressed in skirts so short you can see their butt cheeks ( we unfortunately did when one of the servers bent over to pick up a fork and mooned the entire dining room). or if you enjoy paying $10.00 for 5 rings of greasy fried calamari. 

I can only assume that this place is so busy because it is in a busy shopping mall and right by the movie theatre. Once we looked around we realized that all the other patrons were most likely not even of legal drinking age. 

Never again!!"}
{"text":"It's noisy but a it's a chic place and they have chic foods as well lol 

You gonna like it, it will make you feel classy :D"}
{"text":"That was quite disappointing, the steak was dry, over cooked, no salt, just pepper..."}
{"text":"By all means, if you have a craving for salt...come to this Moxie's! I smoke, yes tsk tsk, hence I use more salt than most so I was shocked they could so severely over use the seasoning on EVERY part of my dish. The waitress showed little concern at my peril as she took more than half a meal away (I was starved and tried my best).  No I'm sorry, no discount, no thanks for coming! I'm not one to hunt a discount, and on the rare occasion I receive one I make sure the total difference goes into the tip so it not a scam, but really, they couldn't be bothered to offer anything? (My bill was close to $40) Lesson learned...I should of read the reviews! 

With all that said, I have had amazing food AND service at both moxies in shawnessy and across from willow park...please drive a few extra minutes and go there instead."}
{"text":"very classy place, great drinks, awesome daily special, good snacks, munchies, great prices. love the taco platter, free parking"}
{"text":"I like this place. Young crowd, pretty waitresses, and oh yeah, good food.

I had the lettuce wraps for a starter. They were very good with a nice kick. My main was the baby back ribs. They advertise fall off the bone. Not quite, but they were tender and tasty. I'm from the south and know ribs; these are legit in taste.

Very good wine selection. Average beer selection. 

Great stop for a business trip."}
{"text":"Just completed dinner and it was great.  I had red curry with rice and it was wonderful.  My mum had the salmon and it came with green beans and potatoes. The veggies were el dente and delish. My wife had steak with lobster dressing.  The had a kids menu and it was perfect for my son.  Ask for Oneal he was our waiter and was polite and enjoyable.   Great restaurant."}
{"text":"Love the fries!
Atmosphere is good, service is good and overall the food is good without being too pricey.
Settle down after dinner with a glass of wine!"}
{"text":"Friday night around 6pm and this place is pretty full. The only other sit-down restaurant in the mall is Milestones, and we'll try that one some other time. We once ordered takeout from Moxie's and it was great. A lot of people where I work like it. 

We were seated sort of in a hallway, but it was nice because it wasn't in the fishbowl window looking out into the mall, and it was something of a private booth for two. Before dinner I went to wash my hands and the washrooms are immaculate. Great sinks and taps and a fireplace. Nicer than most of the places I lived in Edmonton. 

We ordered a veggie burger and their teriyaki rice bowl, and the food was great. The veggie patty itself was no big deal, but the pesto and vegetables on it were delicious. The rice bowl was great too, although a little sweet. 

Service was quick, with lots of staff buzzing about. I'm not sure they have their table numbering system memorized because we were brought our neighbour's food and someone else was brought ours, which was comical. (Not a huge deduction for that.) 

Overall, of course we'd be back, if we lived closer."}
{"text":"One of the best Friday lunch spots in the airport strip area (aka the wasteland - don't judge Toronto by this area, please). Surprisingly hip looking decor and as mentioned in another review - the waitresses are a bit of an attraction (sit in the lounge if this is your thing - you and all the other guys - didn't see a single female patron here).

Oh yes, the food! Ribs were very tasty - fall off the bone, bit of zing, not too sweet. Heard the burger and salad were very good as well. Sadly the beer selection was seriously lacking (Heineken bad boy special, please!), otherwise I would have been tempted to give it five stars in the bar and grill category."}
{"text":"As a rule Moxies has been  decent chain. Upscale and up pricing
Today's lunch was a disappointment. Steak salad was drenched and soggy and the 4 pieces of thin slices steak, with 2 dollops of feta made it tough to swallow the $17 price
associate had a beef dip the featured shaved beef that took me back to the 1970 boil n' bags, the taste was same according to my dining friends
They have downs Alex the food quality big time,  added more lettuce with weak ass dressing, and kept prices high
Next time will not be a next time"}
{"text":"I have an office close to this location so I have used this location to meet with colleagues pretty regularly in the past. 

One thing I like about this place is that the servers are very friendly and in fact a few of them have been around for at least a couple of years.

Tonight I am here for drinks and apps with one of my mentors who is hosting a good size group (over 30) and the service has been very good considering the size of the group. We essentially occupied the large area just outside of the main restaurant (inside the lobby of the building) and the only thing I will complain about is the fountain that runs in front of the gym. It really smells of bathroom cleaners. Nixies should lobby the building manager to use other chemicals to purify the water because the smell is pretty bad!"}
{"text":"A nice oasis of relaxation while shopping in the mall.  The hospitality here ranks at the very top, and I have never had to deal with a bad attitude here, ever.  The food is always excellent and the service is nearly perfect.  The prices are exactly right for what you receive.

My only complaint is the lighting in the lounge, which I find very annoying. Bright lights over the bar, with no shades, which leave spots in your eyes and make the booths seem very dark.  I hope they fix this soon."}
{"text":"Worst service ever possible.  Came three weeks and service was soso.  Food was terrible. 

Just came here for a change because I always dine at Earls across the street.

Should have stuck with works for me."}
{"text":"I don't understand why people in Montreal feel it necessary to use the word \"chain\" as a pejorative. There are a great many fine restaurants that happen to be part of chains.   Restaurants don't grow into chains by being bad. And if an individual restaurant disappoints it is not because it's part of a chain. It's because it is managed by people who don't care enough to make it good  and one bad experience does not make the entire concept bad. 

I also don't understand the comment \"I didn't feel like I was dining in Montreal...\" What does that even mean?  If you go to a great Japanese or Indian restaurant I would think \"feeling like one was dining in Montreal\" would be a negative. 

Celebrate the diversity of many different styles of restaurant and cuisine. 

They can't all be everything to all people and they can't all (thank goodness) be Toqué."}
{"text":"Absolute terrible service. Me and my girl friends decided to go out for a nice dinner this Friday. We stopped at Moxies and asked for the wait time and they said they were able to seat us down as we did not make reservations. We were offered drinks at the beginning of our service and we all decided to get a jug of rose sangria. The waiter proceeded to ID us and she looked at them and said \"okay coming up.\" and left. A few moments later another associate came up to us asking us for another ID. Completely confused because we are all over the age of 19, a few of us didn't have a matching piece of ID because the swap of purses. The associate looked at us and said \"sorry, I can't sell you this because these IDs won't work.\" Terrible start to my meal, to not be allowed to have a drink of my meal because the staff things i'm underage using a fake ID at a restaurant. RIDICULOUS!! We all got water and the food came a little bit later as we only ordered 3 appetizers to share with the table. We asked for cutlery at the beginning of our meal, never got it through our whole duration of the meal. Asked multiple times for a re fill on the only drink we got, we were sucking on ice for minutes until our meal was done and we had nothing to drink the entire time. And to top off our experience, We ordered more of our sushi cones which we did not receive until the bill came. My friend no longer wanted it so it was taken off the bill. Coming from working in a restaurant business. Absolutely terrible and unpleasant. Never again!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Tables for two are on the smallish side if you're not lucky to score a booth.   The restaurant was busy when we arrived and busy when we left.  Since I had forgotten my glasses, very dim lighting made it hard for me to read the menu clearly but the waiter was able to make recommendations.  I had the chicken rigatoni in Madeira sauce which really a misnomer.  Where exactly was the chicken?   The Big K was luckier with his selection :  steamed Australian whitefish dress  in a bed of jasmine rice  The drink special of the night was Miami Clear which tasted slightly medicinal with the essence of aloe and orange vodka.   Delivery of food items was timely with military-style precision, making for a quick dinner and fast exit."}
{"text":"Surprise!  A chain restaurant that produced a fine meal for our party of three.   Shanghai noodles were ordered hot as in spicy and we weren't underwhelmed as we normally are by restaurant chefs who wimp out on the heat.   The usual Moxie sized throng of skinny girls wearing uber short skirts were missing from the front of house and a nice waiter in black pants and shirt took us to our table.    Great hamburger.  Super fresh salad; not super-saturated in dressing.     Nice service.   Professional and not overly friendly (as in I'll tell you my name, write it on your table, on the receipt and on your forehead and beg you to return on the way out)."}
{"text":"I have said one too many times that I will never go back to Moxies again. It's not just due to one specific location, but the overall lack of good experiences at any of the Moxies I've been to.

I was at the Yorkdale location just this weekend to have dinner. Everything was going good until the food arrived. My friend had ordered a sirloin steak, medium rare. I took a look at the piece he was given on his plate and commented how tiny it was. This was a $22 sirloin cut? Ok. So he cuts into it, and of course it's raw in the center! I told him, you can't eat that. So, he shows it to the server and she says she'll take it back and put it on the grill. 10 minutes or so later he gets it back, but this time it's the manager delivering it. He places it back on the table and asks my friend to cut into it to make sure it's right. The color looks okay, but by now the meat looks like shit because it's been cut up and placed that way back on the grill.

So, now of course it's totally dry. My friend said he could not eat it at all. So, he returns it to the server who doesn't even make any effort to apologize or offer anything for the lack of dinner he had. She just takes the plate away and doesn't return. 

Once we get the bill she charges him for the full steak. At this point I was so aggravated by the lack of customer service from this place. I explained to the server that the steak was inedible from the moment it arrived, and the attempt to fix it made it worse so it was not even eaten and that we were not going to pay for that meal. 

She says very little to us other than \"I'll go run this by the manger\" (or something to that effect). She then returns a while later with the bill and the steak removed from it. But she never once apologizes or says anything about it, instead she completely ignores the whole issue then walks away each time.

I didn't even tip her. I paid and left.

After many bad experiences at Moxies, this was absolutely my last time going back."}
{"text":"This restaurant was bustling on a Monday night  which is clearly an indicator of its popularity.  Although obviously busy,  our  server was charming and the meal delivery was perfectly timed.   I had the triple AAA steak sandwich from the winter menu and although I thought the portion size was small there was a bonus to it - it  left me more room for dessert: warm Gingerbread cake.  So good!"}
{"text":"I eat here with my girlfriend all the time. They always give me a private booth when I ask. Service is consistent. And the Mojitos are fantastic!"}
{"text":"The food here can be decent depending on what you order. The pasta is good but the fish tacos are the worst I've ever had. I find it overpriced for the quality of food. I could get better food elsewhere for the same price. The service also really depends on the waiter you get. The first waitress we had was extremely rude, the second waitress was nice. I probably won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Food is way too standard to go above 3 stars however the atmosphere is great! Love all the windows :D And their lava cake is legit the best! Would go back just for that!"}
{"text":"Pop was warm and flat, steak and mashed potatoes were overly salted, salad had very little lettuce, and very little effort put into the smashed guacamole. Overall a disappointment and would not dine here again."}
{"text":"Excellent Steak here! Nice enough staff too but a little pricey. I would go again because that steak was so dang good!"}
{"text":"I liked it Moxies Montreal much better than the one in Richmond BC. They have a lot of variety in their food. I look upon it's a high end bar with decent food.  If you are looking for that you won't be disappointed. If you afford to spend $200 per couple every time you go out to eat then you would probably not enjoy Moxies. For me it's a good alternative and save the higher end restaurants for special occasions."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of Moxie's to begin with, and my experience here on Saturday night didn't change anything. I guess the fact that it was hardly busy at 6pm on a Saturday night speaks volumes. The server also told us they barely get any business on Sundays when my friend asked about football there.

For starters, the server was very pushy about ordering drinks. I hadn't even sat in my chair yet. My hubby likes to browse the drink menu and she just stood there staring at him and throwing out random suggestions until he finally told her he needed a minute. Within a minute she was back and staring again so he just told her a drink to make her go away. She kept suggesting alcoholic drinks to me so I said I was pregnant and she sarcastically says \"oh I guess that'll be a water then?\" I don't appreciate her attitude.

The only thing I ate that I enjoyed was the nachos my friend ordered. I had the turkey club and it was really plain and the turkey was disgusting. It was bright white, overly salty and had a weird texture. The fries were mushy, greasy and overly salty too. I love fries and I ate maybe 4. My hubby got the appetizer sushi cones and they were just a large mess. As soon as he touched them, everything fell out. He didn't enjoy my fries either, and our friends had the same complaints about them (greasy and over-salted).

To top it all off, the music was RIDICULOUSLY loud. I could hardly hear my husband beside me and I couldn't even talk to my friends across the table. I asked for it to be turned down, and then the lights were lowered but not the music. I like loud music but I thought I was at a club, not a restaurant. I'm glad I had a gift card so I didn't have to spend my own money there."}
{"text":"Amazing service, welcoming even after midnight. Karim is really superb, and we even came back the next night because of him!"}
{"text":"After this meal, I'd be happy to eat at this restaurant every day till I've tried everything on the menu!  

This is where Kevin & I went for his 15th Birthday.  He had wings and sweet potato fries .. and coke of course.  I had steak salad and a sangria.  We both loved our meals.  

They brought Kevin a mini brownie for his BD and I got a mini dessert as well.  Both were larger than expected and served with ice cream.  Delicious!

All of the staff were really nice, friendly,  and efficient."}
{"text":"This place is beautiful! Very similar in style to the Keg restaurants with the dark interiors and fires in the walls etc.. Very busy environment, a little too loud for my liking but that just shows how popular it is! We started with mojitos which were beautiful And the food was lovely! Staff were also lovely, will be coming back! 
It's a little bit of fine dining so dress up and treat yourself"}
{"text":"Nice location with lots of parking.  Food is good and servers are beautiful, especially in the bar area.  Last time I was there they seemed pretty flirty and somewhat fake in their friendliness.  A great place to take a date or a client for lunch.  Watch your speed as you come along Dixon road though getting there as they Toronto Police like to set up speed traps."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner a few nights ago. The service was slow at first, but got better later. My burger was decent, but not worth the price; I've had better burgers at restaurants for less than $16. Furthermore, my buddy's steak was mediocre. Since it is overpriced, I won't be visiting again."}
{"text":"This just goes to show you that even with a chain restaurant, you can have wildly disparate experiences. Whereas my burger was near perfect at the Moxie's at Courtney Park in Mississauga, my burger today in Richmond Hill was a pretty big letdown. 

The burger sauce that I loved so much on the Mississauga burger was just off here. The balance between the mustard and mayo was heavily skewed toward the mustard and it overpowered the meat. The patty was a tad overcooked. And the bun, which was an absolute mastery in Mississauga, was a tad mealy (maybe bordering on stale?). Even the top of the bun was starting to flake off as glossy crust is wont to do when staleness sets in.

The sweet potato fries were beyond limp. They were completely impotent. All the viagra in the world couldn't bring these fries to attention. 

Service was nice, but the food was a disappointment. Luckily I know how good the burger in the Mississauga Moxie's can be or I'd probably be averse to ever coming back to a Moxie's again."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch today and ordered the burger and sweet potato fries. The burger was incredibly good. The bun was the most perfect burger bun ever. It was soft and pillowy, but it didn't disintegrate with all the lovely burger juices. 

The beef patty was incredibly juicy, tender and beefy. This patty was not dense or dry in any way. If beef could be light as air, this patty was airy. I don't mean insubstantial, I simply mean juicy and lightly packed and just so so good. 

The burger is topped with what appears to be a whole grain mustard-based \"burger sauce\". I'm guessing a mix of whole grain mustard and mayo. It really suited the burger well and I didn't need any ketchup or yellow mustard on this burger.

The sweet potato fries were thin, crispy, and great. The chipotle aioli that came with it was also really good. 

I am seriously in love with this burger. 

The only reason I wouldn't give this place a 5-star rating is because it's too loud and I disapprove of the fact that the poor female servers are forced or \"strongly encouraged\" to wear high heels. That's not safe and that can't be comfortable for those poor ladies. They're going to end up with serious foot and leg problems later in life."}
{"text":"Went here with my girlfriend and her family for her graduation lunch. The decor is very sleek and modern, nice private booths as well. 

What was ordered: a burger and fries, Dill salmon, broccoli soup and half turkey club, French Toast and 2 classic breakfasts. 

It surprisingly wasn't busy for being 12:30pm. Our food took 35 minutes to get to our table. People who came in after us had received their food before we had. We were told by the manager that the French Toast takes a while to make (I don't see how that is true seeing how I work in a Kitchen as a cook and can say that it doesn't take longer than 3 minutes to make). 

The food was mediocre. The French toasts crust was way too hard and chewy, they had forgotten the Toast for the classical breakfast as well. You defiantly don't get what you pay for here seeing how a breakfast you can make better at home is $13 at Moxies. Way overpriced."}
{"text":"Terrible,
Tacos to share, soggy and too tangy with lime juice 
My boyfriend and I were there for my birthday and first we got a table which we didn't like and got it changed 
The waitress that we got asked us for drinks, to which we replied that we're not of age yet to drink and treated us like children throughout which I found disrespectful.
We ordered the burger with fries. The fries were dry and tasted as if they were looked long ago and just left there. Usually moxies doesn't charge for drinks that are just pop, but they did and didn't tell us... but we were stunned at the bill. But I didn't bother tipping because I was disappointed at the food. Also I'm trying to have a nice dinner with my boyfriend and it's uncomfortable when the waitress keeps asking about the food 4 times when I can't even respond with a mouth full ."}
{"text":"Waitresses are dressed inappropriately and food is horrible...not sure why in most of restaurants in Toronto have such inappropriate dress codes for waitresses."}
{"text":"Still my go to place for half price wine on Wednesdays. The best and consistent plate is the margarita pizza. The fresh basil and mozzarella quality makes it. Curry chicken and seafood pasta great also. Choice of wines are standards. mcmannis j. Loar and liberty. Etc."}
{"text":"Food was good, and service was great. Can always depend on Moxies to have good quality service."}
{"text":"Save your stomach and tastebuds...don't go...

My visit to  Moxie's was memorable in that I will never forget the heavy gross feeling that followed after eating food that was just plain bad.  

I ordered the Crab-Scallop Cake Benedict while my dad ordered the California Fish Tacos.  Both sounded good on the menu.  BUT, the fish was over battered, with very little meat, and the batter itself was thick, heavy and the oil tasted old.  I was also disappointed to get a deep fried crab-scallop cake over a thin toast crisp that was slightly soggy.  The flavour of the cake was totally masked because it was again over battered and over fried in stale oil.

The decor was beautiful, the service was adequate.  But I will never submit my stomach and tastebuds to this kind of torture again.  Unfortunately, this also means I will probably never visit any other Moxie's Classic Grill.  I think the recipes may be innovative but the actual execution is weak.  Too bad."}
{"text":"Meaty and juicy if your looking for a fatty sinful dish.  Quinoa veggie Salmon dish if you're looking for a fresh crisp and organic dish.  This restaurant has it all and it's absolutely delicious.  Albeit pricy but just delicious,  with a cool vibe at the bar,  and a relaxed ambiance in the main restaurant."}
{"text":"I got the Huevos rancheros for brunch. The food was alright. I thought the restaurant had a great atmosphere. I wish they had more unique offerings and more services. However, I would not mind visiting this place when I am in the area."}
{"text":"I have been a regular at Moxies since they opened this location and am not sure what has happened. Last month we came in an hour before they closed and were one of 2 tables and them waited for 35 minutes to get Nachos! Yesterday tops that - we were seated in the lounge; my vegetarian wife asked if the could substitute shrimp for chicken in the enchilada - no go but understandable. I ordered a Classic hamburger with orange cheddar and she ordered the lobster penne. 40 minutes later and voila the food arrives. The pasta is warm with a tiny piece of lobster and 3 shrimp (not prawns!) but edible! My simple burger though was stone cold - the waitress takes it away and 10 minute later comes back triumphantly to tell me she had spoken to a manager and they were going to remake my burger - not sure what the option was but it scares me! 20 minutes later I get my burger as ordered but the adventure is not over - the bill comes and surprise! We are charged for both burgers! I pointed this out to the waitress and she explained it was an oversight and that she had to enter my order a second time to get the kitchen to cook it. The manager did comp our entire order but a free meal did not make up for the disappointment of what one of our favourite restaurants has become!"}
{"text":"We were desperate for food after our flight got in late. Not many options in the area. Walked to this place. Bartender was nice and attentive. However...
This was some of the worst food I've EVER tasted. We had lettuce wraps to start, which tasted like fish (unintentionally) and had rotten cilantro on top. I had a lettuce wrapped burger and side salad. The burger has zero flavor and my salad was obviously premade and sat in a cooler for a long time, as the lettuce was completely wilted and had lost its shape. Did they even look at this before serving it? It was inedible. I can't believe this meal cost 75 dollars (we each had a beer). 
I wouldn't recommend this place at all, even if you're desperate. Go to Subway."}
{"text":"This was our first time dining at Moxie's Scarborough Town Centre location and what a memorable experience thanks to their amazing team member Sameen!

Sameen was very attentive, personable and provided us with excellent recommendation from the menu. He took the time to connect with us on a personal level and ensured we were having a great time. Our food arrived quickly, tasted fresh and delicious. 

The guest service we received from beginning to end from the entire staff including the Restaurant Manager was an absolute 10/10.

Would highly recommend Moxie's Scarborough location for their customer service, ambience, menu option and value!"}
{"text":"Came here a couple weeks back with a group of friends, and they actually opened up the patio early for us that evening (despite it being near subzero temperatures). We were the only ones on the patio, had a nice environment (they put the heatlamps on for us), and our server was very nice and attentive. She even indulged my request to do a vodka soda with surprise combinations.

For that reason alone, they get five stars. One of the best (and classiest) hangouts in Mississauga, as far as I'm concerned."}
{"text":"John was amazing. Best service ever. Chicken and mushroom pizza was to die for and lettuce wraps were good. Peach Bellini drink also good, blended."}
{"text":"We had a pretty good meal there. We had worked late and just needed a bite to eat. Unfortunately the place was hopping and the service was very lacking. But the food was very nice."}
{"text":"I like the decor of the lounge. There were some aesthetically pleasing waitresses to the eye. Service was good but the food was bland. 

I ordered a medium rare New York strip and what I received was a tough, dry and medium well steak (if not well done). The twice baked potato was very tasty.

I would go back for drinks but definitely not for food."}
{"text":"Decent food, but very rude staff.  My coworkers and I went here twice during our stay in Mississauga.  The restaurant is trying hard to be a trendy place, but missed the mark.  I mean how can you be this hip place when you are in a strip mall and Chuck E Cheese is next door?  Not only is the restaurant trying hard, but so are the staff.  The girls working were so rude.  Our waitress forgot my coworkers order.  When I flagged down someone to ask about the order, the waitress was really rude and made it seem like it was our fault.  The fact is, she forgot to place the order.  Never once did she apologize for her mistake.  Also, when our entrees came to the table, the other wait staff that help bring the dishes to your table, just plop down the plates.  They got everyone's orders mixed up and didn't care that there were still our appetizer plates still on our table.  They didn't bother cleaning the plates off and just began shoving the plates over with our entree plates.  What's the point of asking us to order in a particular way if you don't fulfill the order correctly and just give the food to anyone at the table?  I wasn't impressed and was laughing when I saw they got 3 and a half stars.  There are better places to go....."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant with a good, varied menu.  Great for steak lovers!  The waitresses are always super friendly and helpful, and cute! :) The food is good but never anything to write home about. 

The Med Bread on the appetizer menu is a good sharing plate - long strips of flatbread toasted with rosemary & cheese - and comes with 3 different (mediocre) dipping sauces.

The house Amber beer is really good!"}
{"text":"It's a rare restaurant that manages to jump between highs and lows so effortlessly, but the end result was a net positive.

Before Moxie's moved to its current site in Square One (adjacent to the outdoor fountain and City Centre Transit Terminal), it occupied a spot on the other side of the mall and was a good place to come for lunch meetings. It was also the place where I ate what I still consider to be the biggest burger I've ever ordered in my life, a monstrosity that was piled high with ingredients and was nearly as tall as my face.

I had been meaning to get over and try out the spot since their move/renovation, but I only finally had a chance when a group of friends were on town and we were looking for a patio to visit. We breezed in effortlessly and were immediately seated at a nice spot with good views of the fountain.

The first thing you'll probably notice are the waitresses. Visions of the former Earl's Restaurant danced in my head as I saw waitresses wearing not-all-there minidresses stalking around looking for customers to serve. Far be it from me to look down on the management for enforcing the dress code, but I nearly choked on my food after witnessing a server stroll past in a skirt so short that, to quote Patrick Stewart from the BBC show \"Extras\", \"I've seen everything. Yeah, I've seen it all.\"

My friends initially opted for a \"lettuce burger\" (no bun, just everything and meat piled together on a whole head of iceberg lettuce) and a southern fried chicken sandwich (both $16.5), respectively. I settled for a mini salted caramel cheesecake ($5) because I had already eaten prior to coming out, and was a bit disappointed by how small the item was. You'd think for that price they'd give something more than an item that can be downed in three small bites, but beauty over practicality is the norm here, so I shouldn't have been surprised.

Both of my friends reported that their sandwiches were good, though the one who ordered the lettuce burger ended up realizing that none of the extras he ordered (and that the server upsold him on) were present on the burger. To their credit, once we notified the server of the problem, he comp'd the first burger and brought out a second a short while later that not only looked much more appealing, but was stacked high with the missing extras (bacon, mushroom and peppers).

I ended up eating the first lettuce burger - dinner in reverse - and enjoyed it, though it was incredibly messy and left me with all kinds of sauce and juice running down my hands.

The service was very good. Despite our server making it clear that he was a bit harried with other orders, he was around constantly and made sure we had everything we needed. Though I only had a chance to go inside the restaurant briefly, I liked the renovated space, though the washrooms still need to have a few kinks worked out. Ditch the brown napkins and stick to the Xcelerator hand dryers, because the wads of paper strewn around the sinks aren't a good look.

I was impressed with my visit to the site and will make plans to get back again before the end of summer. Moxie's is usually a very solid place to visit when it comes to patio dining, and despite some underlying trappings of the place that the brand can't (or doesn't want to) get away from, this is a decent option for dinner or drinks."}
{"text":"This location opened a few years ago now. I've been to moxies probably since high school. I've always gone to the one at Fairview mall when it was more of a family restaurant feel than the super chic, lounge atmosphere they are today. I really liked the old restaurant but I do have to say, some of the new food is good. I've gone here with girlfriends or for birthday parties. The bar area is dimly lit with large windows where you can get a magical view of disgruntled shoppers and the packed parking lot. The music is usually quite loud so this isn't the best talking environment. I've never been the kind of woman that drank martinis and cocktails. To be honest I'm happy with a pint of beer. But this is the kind of place where you get more of the fancy drinks it seems. The food is a tad pricey but that's expected with the renovated restaurant brand.

I always have to start with the Med Bread (formerly known as the 3 Dip Med Bread). This usually doesn't disappoint. You get 3 different types of dips. One is more of a bruschetta style, there's a creamy roasted garlic one, and the last one I'm not so sure but it's delicious. For my main course, I had the Chicken Madeira Rigatoni. It was nice and creamy, the sauce was delicious. The serving size doesn't seem as large as other entrées I've ordered, but it was pretty decent.

All in all, even though the meal I had was good, I wouldn't make this a regular restaurant I turn too. I'm just not a fan of the loud music and expensive prices."}
{"text":"Came here to catch a dinner and a movie with a small group of friends and was surprised to find that the restaurant was almost full even at 8:30.  A positive indicator for me, as a neighbouring restaurant was nearly empty. 

I'm not a big fan of big chain restaurants, but Moxie's is alright I suppose.  I find the menu prices to be quite high, averaging at about $25 per entrée (excluding burgers which were closer to $16).  I ordered the half rack ribs, smothered in a sticky and sweet barbeque sauce with the meat being tender but not entirely fall-off-the-bone; a small-looking serving on the plate but substantial enough if you don't have a very big appetite.  The best part of the meal to me was the stuffed baked potato, a creamy mashed potato mixed with various toppings like bacon and cream cheese then scooped back inside the potato skin and baked.  Mmm-hmmm."}
{"text":"Moxies Market Mall Location is horrible!  We ordered wings and was white covered with salt ... disgusting!   We wait for the server forever as he is busy trying to get a date with another server ... he finally comes to the table and we tell him that the wings are so salty and they white  ...he then gets us supposedly another order of wings and .... guess what ...it us the same wings refried!!! Now I wait forever again as he is still busy trying to get a date while other tables are clearly frustrated too ... he returns again to our table and I ask for manager who is equally incompetent!!! Please do not go to this location as it is a waste of time and good money paying for crappie food and crappie service!"}
{"text":"Almost good food, steak, pene and classic burger was above average.Very decent decore, polite staff, reasonable prices.
Two appetizers were spicy but deliciouse(calamary and something with goat cheese)"}
{"text":"Decore was good, menue had good variaty, foods were average, appetizers were good, prices were moderate. I did not liked classic burger, steak was average. Brownie witb icecream was good"}
{"text":"The restaurant is nice inside and the service is good. However, the food is nothing special and is just over priced.

They offer a wide selection of options from their menu, however everything is just okay. It's not great but it's not horrible.

I personally would not return. I'd much rather go somewhere that specializes in a couple of foods compared to somewhere where all the food is extremely mediocre."}
{"text":"They changed their brunch menu! And not for the better. I remember they had more offerings like a breakfast burrito of sorts. I much enjoyed that old menu. They've downsized the selection to 1 page. Total sad face. The food was still good but that old menu though was better...bring it back and then some Moxies! Waaaaahh :p"}
{"text":"I love how Moxie's standards are uniformly amazing regardless of which location you chose to dine/lounge in.
I just moved in to the area and I enjoyed my evening here with my girlfriend.
We had tasted wine while we waited for our table at the lounge & when we got our table, the server promptly attended to us. 
The food and wine was great.
I would highly endorse this place."}
{"text":"Well I'm BAAAAAAAAAAAAAACK!

I hadn't been to Moxie's Yorkdale in quite sometime.  Thank God for the lounge area.  Since the resto is close to the theatres, you have to deal with a lot of the underage late night crowd from the movies. 

So we had Aryana as our server. Very friendly are cheery.  Since we were right by the bar, our drinks came out quickly.  She wasn't one of those pressure servers.  I was a little disappointed that we didn't get to finish our fries before our main dish came out.  So the timing was off there.  I would suggest if you want a somewhat light late dinner, order the steak salad.  It was pretty good.  

Another set of friends came and she was very helpful to them as well.  Then all of us ordered the sticky toffee pudding.  We asked Aryana to give us more of the chocolate sauce since they were a bit tight on it.  She gave it to us no problem.  

So all in all the ambiance was EH because of the kids, the service and food were great, the one woman who was literally at our tables just about when we were done our food and drinks...thumbs down.  Overal a pretty good experience."}
{"text":"worse experience, been to many Moxies's and this one was outstandingly horrible. Went there and realized they have changed their menu, i always ordered their mayan chicken salad, and they had a new promo for alex chang i believe thats the name of the chef.

server was very rude and snobby i believe the name was Tressa, and when we complained the manager Laura was horrible, she didn't take our complaints seriously and  was super rude, when we told her that our white chocolate brownie was really tough to eat, it was hard, its supposed to be tenderish, and i love it and always order it religiously. Forget comping, at least make us a new one, and their steaks were meh at this location for some odd reason, but at least be respectful. we later on found out from a friend that Tressa was the daughter of the accountant, thats why this unprofessional manager Laura didn't bother saying anything to her! we never went again!"}
{"text":"Came to this Moxie's because it was across the street from the hotel. Been to a dozen Moxie's across Canada and the food is always good, as it was here. I'm a business traveler and came here because I can get a healthy, good bite and get some work done. Unfortunately, their internet was producing no signal and the manager didn't know how to fix it. I was told it happens often. Big downfall for for some of us. 

Meanwhile, the service was fair (I came at 9:30 and they seemed low on servers). Still, the lemon pepper haddock I had was excellent. Tasted fresh, had a tremendous amount of flavor and the sides were good, too. 

As with every Moxie's, great decor and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Arrived on a busy Friday night without reservations and they still found a table for us.

The service was excellent.

Food was great (for me) I had the steak.

Husband had the alfredo penne chicken and DID NOT enjoy it....

He said it was awful.

Our friend had the enchiladas and said they were great.

Can't win them all......"}
{"text":"You can find me here almost every Wednesday, for Wine Wednesday. Whoever thought of that should be awarded and given a holiday! 

Since I am close to this location I really enjoy it here. Most of the time I go to the lounge area and the waitstaff is always friendly. 

I like to order the 7oz, Sirloin with a side of baked potato stuffed with mashed potato and the garden salad. The portion is just right and the price is reasonable for what you are getting. 

Tip: for wine Wednesday it's half price wine and you can bring home the bottle if you can't finish :-) that's how we like to do hump day!"}
{"text":"Service is good food is ok. My steak was under cook. It can tell just by touching it. Spinach salad have 20% spinach the rest is other veg. Chicken is a bit dry. Restaurant design is very nice. Good for gathering with friends but don't expect great food."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner and there was a 45 min wait so they took my number and called us in 30 min.....I was in the washroom and missed their call and in two minutes they gave away our table. No text. The next table was available in another 30 min. We were already seated and having drinks at the baton Rouge next door.

Very unprofessional to have given our table away in two minutes. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I tend to reserve everything, so i did the same, since it was Friday night and all, but place wasn't even half full. 
They did see my reservation, yay, OpenTable works! 
The design is nice, waiting staff is rather friendly. 
G&T was GREAT, point to bartender! If i have a chance to get back for more if - i'll take it!

Now food... I ordered a medium done steak, aaaand it came in as a perfectly... well-done. I was really hungry and could live with that for that night, but this won't be my choice for meat next time (and here i was hoping for better luck with a _grill_ place), for the price of it i'll prefer to have something as i want it. 

Not terrible, but no wow either"}
{"text":"Flexibility 0,  we came around 11:05am and asked for the breakfast menu. They told us that the breakfast ended at 11! Can you believe that? When a restaurant doesn't have that kind of flexibility, and it's charging the prices this Restaurant is charging... Damn good luck staying afloat... You'll need it. The meal menu they gave us where not really suited for morning food. All really heavy food you'll want to eat around 5 o clock but 11? 

They think a good restaurants it's all about having cute girls running around. The guy that owns this restaurant has it all wrong. 

It is a nice place. And the cute girls strategy seems to work with some guys but not me. I'm all about the food and the service."}
{"text":"I try my best not to review chained restaurants, because I don't think it's fair to judge them considering my impossible standards. But if you're going to sell me something a certain way and not live up to it, then the wrath of my typesmanship shall not spare you.

Right, so the idea of a franchise calling themselves \"Moxie\" is a huge expectation to live to up, I mean..the place has got to have moxie if you're going to call it that, and for people with moxie..this place is like a unlubricated massage.

I've come here twice for lunch, because I was dangerously bored and didn't want to travel. This is the only restaurant in Fairview aside from Spring Rolls. One does not expect much from a eatery located in the great North American institution that is the shopping mall. But hey, it seems that they've spent a lot of money decorating this place..so let's try it.
Both times here I've chosen to sit at the bar area..as the restaurant area looked unappealing. Both times I was greeted by the same Maitre'D, big smiles when being seated, and complete awkward avoiding of eye contact afterwards. Weird, what wrong with her? She sat me at my table, not woke up drunk next to me.
High chair with cruiser tables..wobbly cruiser tables...here we go again!
This seemed like a place where middle-aged Men enjoyed lunching, which isn't surprising given the young girls that worked here. I always try to engage in conversation with my service staff...but quickly I learned that this gesture was a complete waste of time, as I have absolutely nothing to talk about with these girls. One cute chick asked me how to buy stocks, I asked her whether she's ever heard of TD Waterhouse or any other brokerages..she said no like this was normal. There was a moment of awkward silence, and then I smiled at her, patiently explaining the process. 
The fish & chips was breaded with a batter that is so salty I had to ask for two points of water. It was hard to finish. The taco fish is nothing special. The fries were plain, my drink was reasonably priced. They didn't have Ketel One vodka, so my friend had to order something else. He only drinks Ketel One. The manager came out during our lunch and apologized to us for not having the vodka, but did it like we were one of the guys he played poker with on Thursday nights. I don't like casual gestures, and I felt interrupted. 
The place reminded me of Joey's at Shops on Don Mills, with less plasma televisions. I'm not sure what kind of ambience they were going for, but it didn't work. The modern fake wood siding didn't match the pub-like crescent seats mounted by the wall, and the bar itself looked as if it was missing a pole and a couples of dancers. 
The waitress will come to you twice and ask whether everything is okay, which is perhaps more than I expected. I don't get the uniform here either. Some are wearing all black, a few others are roaming about in a tank top with their tits hanging out. Guess which ones I asked for the refill?

Somebody please tell me just what is so 'classic' about moxie's grill? 
Honestly, Moxie's? It is like me opening my own restaurant and calling it: Hung."}
{"text":"We had a great family dinner here last night (2 adults, 3 children) without looking like a \"family restaurant\".  I appreciate that they have a children's menu with free refills and dessert included. Everyone left satisfied."}
{"text":"Stopped in here yesterday for lunch and experienced your typical Moxie's drill: solid food/some stunning waitresses and some ok ones/great service. This location is off the beaten path when it comes to retail locations, but nestled in a commercial business district. 

Ordered the lemon pepper haddock and it was perfect. Tasted great. Was cooked exactly how I expected and the sides were delicious. Great place to come for lunch/dinner."}
{"text":"I've been to two dozen Moxie's across Canada during my travels and have never had poor service. Regardless of where you go the entire chain promotes attractive women who are professional, respectful and good waitresses. This location doesn't steer away from that model bringing a upbeat, trendy atmosphere in an area where many hotels rest close by. The service is good. The restaurant is sparkling clean and there's ample alcohol. 

Meanwhile, for the first time I wasn't thrilled with the food (and I've been to this location three times now). I brought a friend from Toronto who doesn't like eating at chains, which Moxie's is. He took a chance, ordered the Chicken and Ribs and it was a let down for the price you have to fork out. The ribs were ok, but the chicken was bone dry. My lemon pepper haddock was overcooked and didn't rival the flavor it's brought in my previous experience. And, my caesar salad was overwhelmed in dressing. I'm guessing the A-Team cooks were off on this night. 

However, for the most part this chain delivers much better than average food for a chain and I'm guessing if you come that experience will show. Unfortunately, our food wasn't at par, but likely the service was."}
{"text":"This seems to be the ultimate sausage-fest Moxie's. As close to the airport as it is every businessman in the province seems to hang out here and try to flirt with the girls (some of the prettiest I've seen in the chain, by the way). The bar is normally littered with guys in suits and men hoping to get a wink from women 10-30 years younger than them. It's defintely great people watching and the staff does a great job at stroking their ego. Personally, I sit in the restaurant rather than the bar to avoid this scene. 

This Moxie's is no doubt a great place to come kill time before a flight, however. You'll find great service, lots of attractive women and better than average food. A fewer than five minutes from the terminal it's a great spot to drive in early to avoid GTA traffic and relax. 

As for the food, no one can argue it's far better than everything else within a five minute radius of the airport. On this last visit I ordered a starter salad and the Haddock, which is always a great dish. Realistically, there isn't anything on the menu that isn't good. They do a great job at delivering quality entrees here."}
{"text":"In case you are wondering why they are refreshing the restaurant, according to a few of the construction crew, the whole restaurant and hotel rooms have a major bedbug infestation. Tonnrs of the rooms are gutted to the studs and so is the restaurant. Skip it when it reopens."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints me, good food, good service, nice environment and fair prices. Perfect for celebrating birthdays with friends. I really like it!"}
{"text":"Every time I come here I say to myself \"it's been a while\"

Every time I leave recall why. 

Classic moxies. Hot chicks in tight outfits. Clean location. Food looks great. 

But I feel as though the concentrate on how the food looks. Great presentation. 

\"How was the food?\"

Adequate.  Ok. Typical. Fine. 

If you want a place to take some good food photos for your Instagram account, this is the place. 

If you want great tasting food, this isn't the place."}
{"text":"5-star for service. 3-star for food. 

I decided to go with the 5-star cuz I really wanted to highlight the kind of service I got! I came here with my fiancée to celebrate our anniversary (which we didn't mention to our server until we got the bill). We came for dinner (around 7) and got seated right away. We chose dining and got seated at a table but we changed our mind and requested for a booth instead, they were quick to move us and gave us no issues! Every staff member we had an exchange with was extremely friendly, helpful, professional and overall happy to be serving! Our server Terry N. was exceptional!!

He knew the menu very well, he went through the daily deals and made suggestions for drinks and mains. And he wasn't pushy at all!

Since it was our anniversary we wanted to go all out! So we ordered a bottle of wine, an appetizer and main. We decided to skip dessert. (See pics)

Food was mediocre, I didn't go crazy over it and probably wouldn't order the same thing again. 

However, food came out fast and we got exactly what we ordered. Our server came back a few times to make sure everything was going well. Before I could even get to the bottom of my glass, he we would come back to refill it! Place is very clean and has an overall welcoming atmosphere!

When it was time to pay, Terry made small talk and we somehow ended up telling him that we were celebrating our 11th anniversary! So he completed the transaction and told us not to leave...5 mins later the manager came and served us dessert! And on the plate they wrote \"happy anniversary\"! The manager was super kind and congratulated us. The Deseret was ok but still such a nice thing to do! Our server came back for the last time to check up on the dessert. 

Mediocre food but amazing service!!"}
{"text":"Nice bar.... good food and ambiance ! A bit expensive though for lunch. They also have a small terrace in the summer."}
{"text":"Nous sommes allés avec des amis qui nous visitent de Denver. La serveuse n'a pas bien réagi quand nous lui avions fait remarquer que la coupe de viande que nôtre ami avait reçu n'était pas celle demandée. Elle étai vraiment \"frustrée\"... 
On a du la rappeler deux fois avant qu'elle accepte rapporter l'assiette... 
Nous n'y retournons pas ... la qualité n'a pas de rapport avec le prix et surtout le service a laissé beaucoup à désirer."}
{"text":"First time in Calgary and the cold plus close distance to this restaurant brought me to the doors of this hotel restaurant. The staff is friendly and is a decent atmosphere. Food was decent too."}
{"text":"After chasing people for parking in Yorkdale, I finally made it inside Moxie's (located near the theater entrance).  

The service was decent, I was greeted at the door and promptly seated. Our server was very pleasant, friendly and provided suggestion for the menu. The service was good, food came out warm, and we asked about the food after we started eating it. 

We started off with Nachos, their nachos were amazing cheesy and full of toppings. For the main course, I ordered their fish tacos. I was a bit scared but the tacos were quite good and the right size. The avocado and lime went well with the fish. You get about 2 tacos and can add one more for extra and I took sweet potato fries as the side. The food was very enjoyable.

Overall, the experience was good!"}
{"text":"This place my friends is hiding with the area of the Airport. I went their for a work colleagues birthday during lunch time. The service was ok as our server didn't show up so someone had to take over which caused a bit of a delay but never mind that the other server was very pleasant and friendly. The service was good, food came out warm, we were greeted at the gate and were checked once the food was being eaten. 


I ordered their fish tacos. I was a bit scared but the tacos were quite good and the right size. You get about 3 tacos and I took fries as the side. The food was enjoyable."}
{"text":"We had a real adventure at Moxie's this evening. In my humble opinion this restaurant should be  totally restaffed. From entrance to exit it was horrible. 

We were greeted by the pleasant short skirted hostess and seated in a booth in a section with six tables. For some reason the waitress who was attentive to the other five tables declined to attend to us. Instead we were assigned a waiter who proved to be very inattentive - but I put the blame on the full staff. 

OK details:
- no cocktail menu provided
- no cutlery provide until after the meal was served
- had a martini served in an old fashion glass because they ran out of martini glasses at 8 o'clock on a Saturday night
- ran out of stuffed potatoes, but served a mish-mash of mashed and baked potatoes (we could physically separate the two potato types on our plates)
- got thirsty waiting for water
- wine got served after the meal was eaten
- pretty sure that the two different red wines were served to the wrong person
- we had to interrupt the waitress to find our waiter to pay. 

It made an impression on me so that I will never go back to a Moxie's."}
{"text":"I've only had bad experiences every time I visited Moxie's at the Yorkdale location. I visited this location without expecting much but was pleasantly surprised. I had the chicken madeira rigatoni and it was absolutely delicious. The pasta was cooked to a perfect texture, right between soft/chewey and al dente with a bit of bite. The sauce was also delicious and flavourful! 

The only downside was the steak my friend ordered. The steak looked extremely dried out and tough. Although the pasta was great I just can't give 4 stars given my past experiences and the tough steak."}
{"text":"It was a really nice place good waiters and servers and the service was not that long. After we ordered (we were 4 people) it took about 20 minutes until the food arrived. Really good and overall great experience. The inly thing i would suggest is that the pasta was maybe a little bit undercooked and bland for me"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  Stop by for a quick one after work... 

The staff is inconsistent.  You never know of they will be helpful, overworked or simply having a bad day....

The food is so bland it reminds me of the baby cereal that kids 1st eat when they are being introduced to solid food..."}
{"text":"Food is the best in the city, however as much as it bites me I will never visit this location again because of continuous horrible service. I used to be a regular customer who would visit this restaurant at least once a week, after a few times being served and being forgotten about I refuse to go back. Also during Christmas while the gift card promotion was on our server Savanna tried to steal the promotional gift card which was valued at 20$ and when I asked the front desk to check the value they said it was only 100 not including the promo value savanna said was added. Also she is by far the slowest waitress there. And when I tired to bring it up to the hostess I was sat somewhere else and again forgotten about. Love their food but even though I live in Caledon I will drive to the Mississauga location instead of coming here."}
{"text":"This Moxie's is located at Fairview Mall, and after going to Spring Roll's forever and ever...my parents and I decided to try Moxie's. In reality, we wanted to go for their patio, and when I arrived, I spotted a sunny corner. I was their first and enjoyed a glass of Pinot while waiting.

My parents and I decided to have an all appetizer dinner which was actually good for Moxie's. I never go without ordering the tuna tartare which is a light, refreshing app. We also ordered the fried spring rolls (can do without next time), the pot stickers (yum!), and two orders of the beef sliders. We also ordered fried calamari and my dad put in an extra order of the linguine. We were not expecting anything wow, as I mentioned, it was really more for the sun. They have a summer menu going on at Moxie's now with some specials on drinks. 

This Moxie's becomes busier as the night continues (or the patio area at least), so service can be slow. When we wanted to get the bill, we couldn't find our waitress so we ended up flagging just anyone to get out. 

Average, nothing special, but great patio if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Not bad, especially if your staying at a nearby hotel. Average food and average service. Decent sized drink menu, nice atmosphere, small bar top."}
{"text":"Attached to The Sandman Hotel, I rather enjoy this spot, and have actually chosen the Hotel on my biz travels  bc of the restaurant. Aside from the convenience, the service is outstanding at the bar (my go to) & the food good.  A decent draft beer selection & full bar. I will say that their pour for anything using spirits is a bit weak (a small pour). Now, when I travel, I'm on an expense account.  The reason I only gave it 3 stars? Prices. It's expensive, and if I were traveling on my own dime, I doubt I would frequent it for more than a beer or two."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, customer service great but the food comes out a little slow. 

The place itself is designed quite sine as its part of Square one.  I tried the salt & pepper chicken wings and they were quite good, I was more scared that it might be too salty but they were just right. 

I also tired their Fish Tacos and they were ok as it seemed like I am eating more of a salad in a bread. 

All in the great atmosphere, slow food service and average food."}
{"text":"I had the Tomato Basil Soup (small portion) with a friend for lunch. The soup was flavourful without being too salty. The small portion is perfect for those who want a light lunch or want to pair it with another entree or salad.  The score was perfect because of the customer service as well. This waiter who served us was very friendly, well versed on the food we ordered, and was friendly. The restaurant itself is spacious and modern."}
{"text":"Very slow service, very hard to get attention of the server. Came here on Friday night with a friend for drinks. The restaurant is not very busy. Had choice seating and chose to sit in the booths. Moxies has consistent drinks menu, they have drinks specials for each day of the week.the drink I love to get is the double shot flavoured absolute - you get to pick any pop to make it into a cocktail and you can choose the flavour absolute, citrus is my favourite. As well, after 9pm everyday they have it for only $6! It's a great deal."}
{"text":"Big fan of this Moxie's: consistently great service, food, and let's not forget their Sunday Half Price off Bottles of wine!!!

I usually come here with my husband and his parents for a Sunday re-connect - we always order the sushi cones (yum) and mains are usually the salmon or steak. My husband (and me quite frankly!!) have been ordering the lettuce wraps as our main because it is soooo delish. The veggie option is so like meat that we always have to ask are they sure it's veggie!

You know what you're walking into when dining at a Moxie's, but this is by far my most fave location."}
{"text":"For the price of the food is not worth it. Although their patio is beautiful along with a private room in the patio. Many other restaurants offering much better food, if not for cheaper. I had asked for cheese nachos for two as an appetizer, the portion I received barely seemed enough for one, I killed the plate myself. I then got the fish tacos, and my boyfriend got the pudding cake for dessert, and a quick tip, it's a pudding cake with ice cream on top, according to my boyfriend he was under the impression he was ordering liquid pudding. As for the fish tacos, they are some sort of bass fillet so if you're anything like me and love shrimp tacos, this comes nothing close to it.

I prob would not return here for a romantic dinner date or any other event, based off the service and vibe we got from attending a party event here."}
{"text":"In summary: TERRIBLE service from our waitress tonight....we eventually left without ordering. Every time we have been there the service has been slow and the waitresses rude."}
{"text":"I don't know if this was the exact location cause I am posting this after I was there.  All I have to say is that the service is extraordinary from the hostess to the girl attending me at the table to the food quality all deserve 5 stars plus!! I had an awesome sirloin with vegetables cooked to perfection and I even got a drink made for me that wasn't even on the beverage menu! This was the Moxie's at the hotel I stayed near the airport! Great place!"}
{"text":"Ended up here since Cora's was a 30 minute wait. Can't wait that long with my sis-in-law and 3 small kids. It's inside the mall and their brunch is decent. Choices are limited for the kids tho.
We had:
- Eggs benny with pancetta
- Eggs benny with crab cake
- Kid's french toast with strawberries
- Kid's pizza
I had a mimosa, but they put ice in it. I'm used to just cold champagne and OJ but no ice. The bennies were slightly smaller, but the hollandaise tastes better than Cora's.
Service was great, attentive and fast with a smile. 
Good brunch option from a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE.

yes that deserved the capitals.

came here WITH a reservation for 13 during lunch time, waited 15 minutes to get my water and than another 40 minutes for my food. Never once did the waitress refill my water, let alone ask me if I wanted anything else, INCLUDING dessert.

the meals were dropped off and the next thing I knew we were paying our bill to go back to work, with an 18% gratuity. I understand with large parties that it is standard to the bill, however it felt like Shannon knew she was getting the tip so we got LESS THAN the minimum service.

Truly disappointed with my experience."}
{"text":"Love this spot - always fun for happy hour before dinner or for lunch with coworkers. Waitresses are a bit airy and aloof which I didn't like but not a big deal if you're only getting drinks. Fun & young place right in downtown. Location is amazing"}
{"text":"I actually really enjoyed this place.

Ambiance 5/5 - this is the selling point of the place. There is a bar area downstairs with super tall ceilings, lots of light, and beautiful modern decor with exposed plants. We came on a Friday night and the place was nearly full, but we were taken to a table upstairs in a huge dining area with another large bar. Everything looks clean, modern, and upscale/trendy without overdoing it. The bathrooms are marble which I really liked. The music was AMAZING. It's a lot of Latin top 40 hits that bring a great vibe to the 20 something crowd that can be seen here.

Food 4/5 this place has a lot going for itself and my friends said that the food isn't one of them. I politely disagree because the menu has options for everyone. I liked the sushi cone appetizer (3/5) but it was mostly rice and shrimp tempura- it needed something else. I also got the lettuce bun burger with sweet potato fries and it was weird to eat but really good, although my burger wasn't the best quality. 

Service 3/5 pretty average service, the ladies are all good looking which is a selling point but not the friendliest. HOWEVER, the staff assisting the waitresses deserve recognition. The food runners and other waitresses brought out things that our waitress forgot and made sure we had everything! They were super accommodating to our party of 9. 

Drink 5/5 I had a great Moscow mule. No complaints."}
{"text":"My wife and I went there for a nice Sunday dinner today. Had a good experience at the Moxies in East Beaver Creek area a year ago so we were open to it. We were seated promptly and our server introduced herself.  My wife ordered the Blackened Chicken Sandwich with side Caesar Salad. I ordered the Beef Burger, no cheese, gluten free bun and sweet potato fries.  About 15-20 minutes later another server brought over a sandwich board with two burgers on it.  One regular burger and a deluxe burger with cheese on it.  I told the server that my wife ordered a chicken sandwich and I ordered a burger with no cheese and a gluten free bun.  She took it away and I could hear her asking in a loud voice where J----- our original server was.  Then our original server brought over my wife's order and told me she was sorry but there was a mixup with my order and it was on it's way.  I said okay, and then started the timer on my phone.  As we waited the Manager came over to apologize and explain that the burger was made with cheese by mistake. I told him I also asked for a gluten free bun.  He asked if I had an allergy and I told him I did.  He explained there were some bits of gluten in the burger.  I said that was fine, as my allergy isn't severe.  He offered soup or salad, and I said no. I wanted to enjoy my meal and leave some room for desert. He went away and the server came back and offered her apologies.  She also offered to pay for the desert.  So we waited and I had to tell my pregnant wife to go ahead and eat without me as her food would have gotten cold.  The server came back and offered the salad or soup option again and I then decided to have the Caesar salad.  She brought that over and I ate it.  Then we waited and waited and by the time the server actually brought over my burger it had been 13 minutes..I was going to enjoy it but I like to eat my fries at the same time and since the fries weren't ready I waited another 3 minutes until the fries arrived.  Then as I was about to eat the manager came over and asked about everything.  I told him we weren't happy as we wanted a nice meal and my meal came 15 minutes after my wife's meal.  We were being forced to eat separately and we didn't enjoy our experience.  He apologized and reiterated that our desert would be \"taken care of.\"  I told him again that our experience had been ruined and if we wanted this type of service we could have gotten fast food.  I told him he needed to pay for our meal.  I saw that he was going to offer some bull, so I even said that we were't even drinking wine. He apologized again and offered us a 'friends and family\" discount as is \"customary.\"  All the while smirking as if he were pulling a fast one on us.  My wife later told me she wanted to ask this arrogant schmuck if \"We looked like friends and family to him, because we're not!\"  lol.  After he didn't get it, I had to ask him if I had to email the owner.  He promptly changed his tune and apologized.  He then said okay to get this right we will take care of \"both\" meals?  I said yes.  Wow what a douche..The poor server probably wasn't trained right and had to pay for the meal.  We felt bad for her as she was nice.  This douche bag manager really pissed me off. Oh yeah-our burgers were fine, nothing to write home about but not bad by any means."}
{"text":"I call this my local because its within walking distance from my house and I have only been and will keep going for drinks because I dont see point in paying silly prices to eat when I can attempt to cook at home. 
So for bar review only, there is not much room at the bar but since I like a glass of whiskey in the evenings I dont mind so much.
The bar staff are friendly, moxies i believe is known for having the hottest chicks and that much is right. 

Update - so on an evening visit to watch the hockey (yes i get it finally) i decided that I will order something to snack on from the menu. Ordered chicken wings and boy was that a waste of $10. 
Considering that even I can make good chicken wings and I am the worst cook in the world, I was amazed at how crispy and dry these wings were. If it was not for the serious amount of sauce on them I would not have ate them.

Lost a star there folks - i would hate to imagine what the rest of the food is like if chicken wings were this bad!

EDIT 

Has lost another star 

Friday night after being down the Gumball 3000 snapping the cars coming in and with it also being a hot humid night by the time I got off at Yorkdale Mall I was in need of a very cold beer.
Sat myself at the bar like normal and tried to get the barmaids attention, nada she was too busy flirting with the baseball cap wearing ballers to even hear my 'excuse me'. 
So a waitress at the end of my bar appears, I ask her if she can get the barmaids attention as it had already been close to 10 minutes. A pathetic call out and she walks off  - WOOOAH what happened to good customer service and actually going around to the barmaid in question.

Eventually on the 10th minute I finally get her attention and voila I have my cold pint and it was worthy of me leaving her a 5 cents tip and letting her know that's what she deserves.

Usually when I go Moxies there is a male barmen who is always on the ball but this time I think management should be aware of such barmaids and keep them to waiting the tables"}
{"text":"I was very happy with the service received at this location. 

I was on my way to meet my boyfriend and his friend and asked him to order me my food because I knew exactly what I wanted. 

by the time I parked and sat down my meal was there. I don't know if it was because I was starved or just because, but my meal was fantastic. I had the chicken, mushroom rigatoni.

we had two servers, one was training and she did a great job. very polite and double checked she got the information correct before she walked away."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of Moxie's or any corporate chain type restaurants, but my friend organized her birthday dinner here so have to grin and bear it. 

We were a group of 15 people with a  reservation for 7:15pm. Some of us were on time and when we arrived at the restaurant, the hostess took us to our table only to discover there was a group already occupied there. She didn't realize this and said to wait as the group would be finished soon, then left us to wait near the table like a couple of idiots.

The group that was occupying the table had a patron whom appeared to have just gotten her food (perhaps she was late) while the rest of her party looked as though they've finished their dinner awhile ago. We waited for about 10 minutes before someone told us to go to the front and wait there while they prepare a table for us. It was maybe another 10-15 minute wait. 

I'm (not) sorry Moxie's, but you knew a group of 15 people were coming. Most restaurants would know that a large group was coming and BE PREPARED for it.

While we were charge an automatic 18% gratuity, the saving grace was the above average service, which of course, Moxie's isn't known for."}
{"text":"Good ambience
Great Location
Nice service
Good bar area

Prices little high but considering their Mall Location, it is fair.

I went for my birthday and also for several business lunches. Its great place"}
{"text":"I recommended this restaurant to my 14 year old daughter to have her first 'grown up' dinner out with her girlfriends. It was a great lesson for me to teach her on how to make a reservation, how to tip properly, to create confidence and independence. They were all excited for their big night out; bought new dresses and fancy shoes for the occasion. They arrive at the restaurant on time for their reservation and were seated right away. The server was courteous and my daughter requested separate bills right when they ordered drinks and appetizers. No problem with that. Then the girls started hearing snickering from other servers about how they were a bunch of 12 year olds acting like 18 year olds!!!! Poof! There goes their confidence along with their self esteem. They felt like they were the centre of ridicule as the servers were gossiping about them, pointing and giggling. The girls still had a great time eating their meals and ordering dessert. Then came the bill and it was perfectly split up as per their request. Being that it was the girls first time at a restaurant without parents, they asked the server for a little clarity and his response was \"Ok girls, I'll only explain it one more time because it's really quite simple\" in a snarky and impatient tone which made them all feel really stupid. Servers shouldn't be too quick to judge and should watch their attitudes. This could have been the girls regular hang out but they certainly won't be back. Neither will any of their friends from school, soccer, hockey, volleyball, basketball or dance. Neither will any of their parents, their parents clients, or their parents friends. Very disappointing and not great for business especially when there are many, many, many different options available. It's a shame that the staff chose to make this a negative experience for the girls instead of a positive one. A little kindness and understanding goes a long way in this world. Especially when you're a group of teenage girls just trying to fit into this world."}
{"text":"Not the best steak ... Medium rare was undercooked but they still got 3/5 stars. A very good food menu. Other parties enjoyed their dish."}
{"text":"Go here if you want a good atmosphere for drinks, but the service may be poor and unprofessional (I feel they hire young pretty girls and don't train them to be real servers).  It's very hit or miss.  On different occasions they've forgotten to place my order, took a really long time to come take our order, and charged us incorrectly.  The food is ok, nothing special, especially for the prices charged.  
Note: this is for the Richmond hill location.  The North York location may be better"}
{"text":"Hotel restaurant.  If its all you have available, then okay, but meh....

Service was good, food was par at best.  Place was quiet and clean."}
{"text":"Usually, I LOVE Moxies. Their White Chocolate Brownie is better than sex. There, I said it. 

So you can imagine my excitement when the Moxies on 17th Ave did a grand reopening and promised to be bigger and better. Imagine my disappointment when I realized this was not the case. 

3 girlfriends and I went by and decided to stop for lunch. First we were seated outside, and I have to tell you, the chairs out on the patio are the most awkward & uncomfortable chairs I've ever sat in. So we asked to be moved inside, which was better. 

We ordered the Ahi Tuna Crisps, the White Chocolate Brownie and the Sweet Potato Fries. Yeah clearly, it was an off-diet day. 

Our server brought everything over at once and the Ahi Tuna Crisps were STALE! I'm not joking. They tasted completely off so we asked for the manager. The manager came by and said they had been prepared a couple of days ago. WHAT?!?!? REALLY?!?!?! And you're serving them?!?!?!? He was completely unapologetic and just talked in circles avoiding the issue. The white chocolate brownie was half-melted and the sweet potato fries were soggy and oily. 

Seriously, this was my worst experience at Moxies EVER and it's put me off the chain for a good, long while. 

I hope your experience at one of their locations goes better than mine, but based on my experience, I wouldn't' recommend it to my worst enemy."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm meeting up with friends in square one for dinner, this is one of my restaurants of choice! I've been coming to moxies since I was in high school so it brings back a lot of memories. They have moved locations recently and renovated so I love the new design! 

They always have drink specials, they actually have one every day of the week so that's always a bonus. As far as their food goes, they're always changing the menus and their chef is pretty creative so it's always a pleasant surprise."}
{"text":"Always a great restaurant!! Food is fresh (get the Kitsilano sandwich - its perfect I must figure out the seasoning on the chicken!) and I love when I say no cheese on anything they actually ask preference or allergy  WOW! I hate cheese and say no everywhere I go and most of of the time that doesn't work. It's a common allergy so I don't know why they ignore such a small request I can't be the only one but still, only restaurant to ever wow me plus its great prices (most meals less than 14 dollars) and you can get dressed up or wear sexy jeans (try to keep it nice not too casual - its no Pizza Hut lol) and have a great time!. I have been to this location in Thornhill since I live in Markham, the one in Guelph (U of G my alma matter) I had my wedding rehearsal dinner in the private room at the North York Sheppard location (only one with a room - I recommend!) and made my own pre-set menu to minimize costs, I had like 8 entre choices that were 9-14 dollars which was perfect! Kept 20 people fed for  less than $1000 after tax and tip :)"}
{"text":"Waitresses were exceptionally nice at this particular location, extra stripper-looking too so the guys were a fan (although one technically looked like a bleached out tranny, the guys opinion not mine) however we were there from 6-9:00 pm on a Saturday night and the entire restaurant was deserted! There were literally 2 other tables in use and we were a party of 15 or so people.

Food is nothing original, there are very little vegetarian choices (no veggie burger available and a $12 salad is with or without meat so that seems like a rip off).

I had the fish tacos (yes, that is NOT vegetarian, it's pescetarian) and was very displeased when I received my \"white fish\" had been completely deep fried and also the wraps were full of drippy mayo. They were ok, definitely fattening and not delicious so I would never order again.

Considering the variety of other restaurants in the area and how Moxies prices are above average $17-25 compared to their competitors I can see why it's empty.

Oh, and having a wiatress who wasn't previously serving our table yell out \"who ordered the brownie\" several times was definitely not classy. NO ONE ordered dessert, turns out it was for the birthday girl but no one knew that. She basically tossed it in front of her when the other waitress came back to confirm where it should go.

Go get yourself a free-appetizer coupon on the Chilli's site and check that place out, it's low-priced and lots of food, LOL!"}

{"text":"We went for lunch on a Monday afternoon.  Were hoping to sit on the patio and enjoy the sun, but this location's patio is pathetically small, no decor/plants and immediately adjacent to parking lot. We opted for the lounge instead.

Service was reasonably quick and friendly - although there were only a total of 3 tables with one server & one bartender working - kinda hard to mess that up. My only complaints were that we had to ask for cutlery, and she didn't come back to see how the food was or check up on us until we were done eating.

I ordered the chicken quesadilla with a Caesar salad, which had far too much dressing. The quesadilla was tasty, but lacked any veggies (I'm glad I'm opted for the salad) and was a little too crispy. Salsa was interesting - probably in-house made based on the unrecognizable/unique tasting spices, so that added a nice touch.

My friend had the classic burger with added bacon and raved about it. I had a bite, and I must say it as pretty good! Definitely had a good size patty and a nice sauce. Fries were a little soft and nothing special.

Overall, a pleasant experience but we won't rush back anytime soon. I think we may try Shark Club next door - looks like they have a nice rooftop patio. Hmmm...."}
{"text":"Food was expensive and the service was sooooo slow. $23 for a veggie burger as fries??? It was just a big mushroom!!!
I probably wont be going back. I asked for water for water four times and It never came!!!
Server was unattentive!!!"}

Beefeater Gins were perfect"}

wassabi tuna tartar-4/5
veal meatballs with bococinni- 4/5
tenderloin steak- 4/5 cooked perfectly"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Sunday (11am)  and customer service was great but slow. The server was nice and friendly but the food came out slow and so did the server when you were ready to order!

They were also nice to offer me complimentary appetizer  (mini fried brioche with dip), since my friends were late and I was sitting there for 45 mins at least. It tasted sort of like churros.

the food quality was alright . Not worth the price and I ordered the egg white omelette and I find the goat cheese flavour was too strong. 

Actually come to think of it, maybe those \"appetizers\" weren't free since my daughter breakfast meal was supposed to come with dessert (which we didn't follow up) and juice (which we opt out)

I've been to better breakfast places for this price so sorry even tho servers were nice , still not worth it for me to come back again for brunch. I might try their dinner though as the Sheppard location for dinner is super awesome (vibe and food quality)."}
{"text":"Came here before shopping, and was thoroughly disappointed with the cleanliness. My first set of cutlery had a dirty knife, so I used 2 forks with my appetizer, and asked for new cutlery for my entree. After I had used the new fork to clear a piece of cellophane off my rice, I noticed a long hair on the new cutlery. Lost my appetite. Food looked great, but was not able to eat it. The manager took the entree of the bill, and made it sound like he was doing me a huge favor."}
{"text":"Ordered chicken rice bowl, and dessert. It took 2 hours to start to finish.  Food was good but the service was EXTREMELY SLOW.   Also they were out of chicken wings  I suggest if you're going to compete in the food industry with all the choices that consumers have make, at least have the basics, good service and the basic foods.  So now keep can say we have been to Moxies twice, the first and last time."}
{"text":"The service here was super slow for happy hour. We originally sat in the dining area and looked through the happy hour menu on the table (and every other table) and then were told if we wanted to order from it, we needed to be in the lounge. Fine, but why put only the happy hour menu on the table?? And this was after we sat for 10-15 minutes with no server. So we moved to the lounge and had another 10 minute wait before anyone acknowledged us. After that things went pretty smoothly but 20 minutes of waiting and having to move tables just to order drinks is ridiculous. I wouldn't bother going back, there are other restaurants nearby with decent happy hours and better service."}
{"text":"Avoid this location at all cost and if you don't trust me, go find out for yourself.  Let's just say that waiting for 15 minutes for your reciep on an empty Saturday night restaurant is a good enough reason not to go. 

Plus below average food you have many other options in the area."}
{"text":"This location ignored us for over 20 minutes, and only came to take our order when we went to go get a server.  Parking is a joke, and we were all left with a dissatisfied feeling with the chain.

Update... It has now been 2 weeks, and management has yet to address our concerns. I highly recommend avoiding this location."}
{"text":"Horrible service and horrible chicken wings (they were very stale and over cooked). The service sucks. I was told to seat myself in the bar section, waited over 15 minutes for service then decided to ask someone, when I did they said they didn't realize anyone was here which was annoying. Ordered fries along with my wings which didn't come to table when I asked for it the waitress claimed that the other girl brought it to us. 

Anyways this place sucks, I rated them a 2 star because the rosè sangria is the only good thing."}
{"text":"I went to moxie's for a dinner date with my wife. We where not happy. 

We sat down. We ordered our drinks they came pretty fast. Then we had to wait half an hour to order our food. 

Finally the waitress came we ordered our food. After waiting 45 minutes we got it

We got what we ordered but the portion sizes sucked. And to top it off the food was not that great either. It was not worth the price at all

My wife left hungry still. Pretty sad

I won't be going back to this moxie's ever again

It's to bad because I love moxie's most of the time."}
{"text":"I went to STC to eat at moxie's tonight. 
I got the chicken chipotle quesadilla, which was alright. The warm plate was a nice touch, but the dish itself was a bit bland. I always see reviews that say \"bland\" but I don't know what it means, so let me explain. There were hardly any spices. I'm guess there was salt, pepper and a bit of chipotle in the dish. That might be awesome if the ingredients were top-notch so the flavours would shine, but it was not top-notch. The bread itself was soft - no crisp exterior and fluffy interior, just... soft. 

The chips had a total count of five, but the salsa was pretty good. The yoghurt dip was very strange. It was thin, runny an sour instead of tangy. It tasted like a 0% yoghurt... I prefer 8% greek yoghurt. Something that actually stays on the chip and won't drip off.
However, the salad was phenomenal. The cheese, dressing and greens were all amazing.

The dessert was... Sorry to say, seriously disappointing :( I got a bite of brownie (mini white chocolate brownie), but it was so dry! It was also not sweet enough, and I have a relatively light palette. It was not chewy or fudge-y at all like a brownie should be. It tasted like a piece of cake/bread pudding that's been left out, uncovered for 5 days. Superbly dry.
The whipped cream on the side was so bland! It was like they didn't do anything to it but add a tiny teaspoon of sugar to the whole batch. Even a touch of vanilla could've improved the cream vastly.
All my friends kept recommending it and raving it so I admit I am pretty disappointed.
My friend who went with me also got the bite of brownie and she said it's usually not as dry, but she said she still loves Moxie's so I'm not sure what that means in terms of Moxie's standards of food... 
All in all I don't think I'll ever go to the STC moxie's again. But If a friend asks, I may try the fairview moxie's."}
{"text":"Of all the Moxies' I've visited in Calgary, this one is definitely one of the best. The location is prime (downtown, right at the 7th Street C-Train stop) and considering it's attached to a hotel, the atmosphere is a lot classier than the other Moxies' in town.

The food may be standard Moxie's fare, but the service here is a lot better than it is in most other Moxie's.

If you've never tried Moxie's, I recommend you duck in and indulge in the white chocolate brownie. Your life will never be the same."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this Moxie's many many times and every single time I have eaten here, the service has been excellent.

What I especially love about this Moxie's is that it's located right inside Market Mall. So you can indulge, and then walk off all those calories while you shop!

Their White Chocolate Brownie is to die for and I often opt to skip lunch and have the brownie instead. The best part about being a grown up is being able to eat dessert as your meal!!!"}
{"text":"We ended up at Moxie's as we had a gift certificate to spent...

Our experience however was below average. The service was nothing out of the ordinary and the food was well overpriced for the quality you get. My conclusion, especially for this location: there is a better value for money at some places in the Market Mall foot court and when steak is on the menu any Keg Steakhouse is better."}
{"text":"Med-Bread - Really liked this appetizer. I wish they gave more bread. But it was perfectly baked and the rosemary added a nice touch. On the dips, I loved the basil mayo. Next would be the roasted garlic dip. I don't even know the 3rd one as it was unremarkable.

Prosciutto & Pancetta Pizza - Very delicious pizza. The dough was baked fresh and the portion was decently sized with lots of toppings.

The service is attentive and checks up on you frequently.

The place can be quite loud but what do you expect from a bar.

Between similar typed restaurants like Kelseys/Milestones, I find Moxies is the most consistent in food quality and service."}
{"text":"- just came for drinks (didnt try the food).

- if you were to visit this place during the week at after work you will see two things
1) attractive waitresses in all black attire
2) a bar/room full of men oggling.
- if you didnt know any better, you'd think you were in a bar on church/wellesey in the village. haha"}
{"text":"Unimpressed. The food itself was quite good. However, our server was terrible. She did not even know the menu. I asked if they had any gluten free beer available & her answer was \"I don't think so.\" Found out later they serve Bard's. When I pointed it out, she just dismissed it and said \"sorry, I didn't know\". Did not ask if I wanted to order one. Another member of our party asked for a refill on a soft drink. Server apparently forgot & had to be asked again. Service was very slow. Also saw servers (not chefs) putting side accompaniments onto plates with their bare hands, as the kitchen area was clearly visible from our booth. Won't be back to this particular Moxies."}
{"text":"The food is decent, especially in comparison to your other options in Fairview Mall. I don't like how it's always so dark in there but it's still not a bad place to have a nice dinner with friends. It has the classic dishes you would find at a typical western restaurant. The portions are generous -- I would recommend the pasta dishes or burgers."}
{"text":"Went here last Wednesday since our daughter wanted to on her birthday and her attraction was the white chocolate brownie....which did not disappoint, though most of everything else did.
Dirty side plates which he had to have replaced
A beef vindaloo which should never be served again imo. The beef was leathery and there was nothing vindaloo about the dish- just a substandard combination of spices that were undercooked as well.
Then our genius waiter brought a dessert for the birthday girl with 3 spoons when there were clearly 4 of us at the table."}
{"text":"Went to Moxies in the afternoon for quick drink and afternoon tea after shopping at STC. They were offering samples of their \"Today's Special\" and Creemore. We ended up ordering a glass of Creemore and a White Peach Bellini.

The bellini was quite juicy but couldn't taste much alcohol in it. No wonder the waitress asked if I want an extra shot inside.

They also have a separate menu for drinks and desserts. I chose picked the Salted Housemade Caramel-Scented Cheesecake with fresh blackberries and orange bits. It was decent but not the best cheesecake. There wasn't anything out of the ordinary in terms of flavour - though I have to say the side berry sauce spiked more flavour for the cake.

The atmosphere at this Moxies is quite relaxing, especially being seated next to the windows. Makes summer seem closer to reality. The service was not bad too - food was served fast and waitress did check on our table every so often."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed. The ribs were \"okay\", and who serves beets as a vegetable anyway!?  Apparently they do. I asked for a Rickard's White, \"no\", how about a Shocktop, \"no\", by any chance Erdinger, \"oh we have that in bottle\". Well ok, I said I'd try that. And then it turns out the Erdinger in a bottle was DARK!!  After asking for three blondes she serves me a dark beer?!  That's no attention to detail, at all!!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a weekday, wasn't busy. 

Pros
- Nice old-school ambiance 
- Servers was professional and informative 

Cons
- Pricey 
- Food is bland and sub par especially for those prices."}

always something new to try!
4/5 star!"}
{"text":"Vanessa our waitress was so friendly and very personable with our group. The food was good with just one criticism. As I have been to this place since it opened one thing remains the same. The food is still on the over salted side.  The ambiance was very cozy and a good place to chill with friends."}
{"text":"Been to several Moxies locations. This one is standard with the others but one thing that put them above and beyond. The manager and waitress ensured that those in my party who were lactose intolerant knew the entree ingredients beforehand. They repeatedly came to the table to assure us of which food items to steer clear of due to their allergies. Excellent customer service. And everyone did enjoy their food. Red curry chicken was good. Could have used a bit more chicken however.  Burgers were good and plenty. Turkey club was dry but allergy to mayo  would have left that out. All else was good."}
{"text":"I usually like Moxie's but their Mothers day service was very poor. I had a reservation and still had to wait 45 minutes to be seated, then another 15 minutes before a server came to us. We ordered the Mothers day specials and didn't get items that were supposed to be included with our meals. Had to ask for cutlery and napkins. Overall a poor Mothers day experience."}
{"text":"It was fairly busy when I came on Saturday night, but nonetheless the service was pretty consistent and attentive! 

My guest and I ordered the calamari appetizer to start, with a gluten-free chicken tacos and salmon entree. He also ordered a small beer which was actually very tasty - forgot the name but the glass had a goose on it? 

The reason for my rating is due to the menu. Truthfully, the chicken tacos were not that great in terms of flavour - I found them quite dry and not anything special. I also didn't really see anything that popped out at me. 

I haven't been here since my late teens, so it was nice to know that this place was still around and the staff were nice as ever with consistent service. However, I probably wouldn't come back or recommend."}
{"text":"Decided to meet here At the suggestion of a colleague.we found this place really good for a casual meeting. the hostess was nice enough to reserve the corner near the window for us.thank you very much for that!

I tried the $.29 wings - absolutely delicious salt and pepper. I was craving a salt and pepper flavour regardless. My colleague later tried the honey garlic wings as dessert.:-)

The server we had was really attentive - she was very pleasant and enthusiastic.we felt very well taken care of.My colleagues commented specifically about it. Good job.

The mini white chocolate brownie was still a decent size and I felt it was perfect just to have a snack before bedtime.boy was I glad.

Location is nice for a sit down place In market mall. I like how they demonstrate their vast selection of wine (in the photo I shared).

The ladies bathroom had two big screen TVs and two fireplaces, which I found kind of interesting.nice touch with the two red sofa chairs.

Nice ambience and reasonably quiet for a good discussion."}
{"text":"What they call an Espresso was embarrassing...but the Beer value on Friday is excellent!"}
{"text":"It was my first time here and I really enjoyed the foods and the wine they served, I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"My wife and I didn't set out to visit this Moxie's location on the night that it opened, but we were walking by after attending a TIFF screening, so we figured we'd give it a shot.

I'm most familiar with Moxie's Highway 7 location, which I've found to be above average. In terms of all the \"upscale casual\" restaurants, I still like Joey more, but Moxie's is probably my second favourite as it's still light years ahead of most of the Milestones-type places and I like it a bit better than earls.

I would give this restaurant a solid 3 stars. The food will never be phenomenal here, but it was all pretty good. We had the kimchi, Korean BBQ  flat bread as an app. The meat and kimchi were very good, but the actual \"flat bread\" was just white pizza dough. I had the prosciutto pizza as a main, and I liked that a bit more. Nothing mind-blowing, and the portion size was on the small side, but I enjoyed it.

The restaurant itself is nice, with massive stone walls and high ceilings, but it pretty much looks just like a Joey or an earls. The location is pretty great though -- I'm so glad to see more restaurants open along University Avenue, which was a dead zone for so long. With other restaurants on the way, like the Cactus Club Cafe that is going to open at First Canadian Place, the financial district is becoming a mecca for huge lounge-ey chain restaurants. Being on the lower part of University also means that it's deceptively close to the Rogers Centre, and it's always good to find another place to dine and drink before or after watching the Jays or another event.

One complaint is that the only beer they have on tap is their house beer, which isn't bad, but I prefer it when there's a greater selection on tap.

Where this restaurant really shines is the service. Our server was fabulous and talked to us for quite a while.

Because it was the first night, every single staff person asked us if we needed anything, which got to be a bit much, but I do give Moxie's credit for really caring about service. That's one thing that's always stood out when visiting this chain."}
{"text":"I went recently for a friends birthday dinner and all I have to stay to start this off is that the service was really disappointing. Our waiter barley came by leaving us to wait much longer than we've liked, but when she arrived there showed no interest and it wasn't pleasing. Since it was just newly renovated at Square it really looks beautiful and clean, and I must recommend you check out the bathrooms, they give perfect lighting for photos ;). 
 Though food wise, I MUST recommend that you try their White Chocolate Brownies..... It just melts in your mouth and has to be the most delicious brownie I've ever tasted! We ordered one of their Classic Italian Pizza's which didn't taste as good but on the side ordered pasta, which in case if you are a fan of Pickle Barrel, Jackastors or any familiar ones like so, their pastas range to be particularly the same.
Over all with the first experience here I wasn't as pleased with the experience as I thought I would be, probably wont be going back any time soon."}
{"text":"I usually get whatever chicken sandwich looks tastiest that day, and it always tastes great. I haven't ordered anything bad in over 20 visits.

I realize now, that if you're hungry then choosing their fries as a side will fill you up, if you want something amazuzing tasting then get their baby spinach salad to go with your main meal. They put some bacon in the spinach salad, and use the grease as part of the dressing."}
{"text":"I sat at the bar and the bartender was great!  The food, however was truly disgusting.  First, it took quite awhile for my order to arrive, and when it did, the  steak was cold,  the veggies looked as if they were about a week past their prime and the potato was really over cooked. I would just as soon walk an hour as not to eat here ever again."}
{"text":"Excellent service .  Went today for Mother's day brunch and it was excellent food with exceptional service.  Waitress was very friendly, food was on time.  All the employees were helping each other was you don't feel like you are waiting for anything
Love the service
Thanks"}
{"text":"usually when i go to Moxie's, i have to find my own seat since the pre-pubescent hostesses in black bandaid outfits are in bed by the time i get there. the kitchen is open quite late compared to similar establishments, and i usually recommend Moxie's when the group wants a menu full of meal options that are not pizza or pickled. however, i don't go during regular business hours when other choices are available (and those tacky hostesses are there). plus, i find that at this time of night, the service is less frantically fake and more calmly hospitable. 
a few of my friends have worked at this and other Moxie's locations (a long long time ago, i did too. but i don't know anyone there anymore). the menus are all the same; approximately 90% of the menu is made from semi-prepared items. the final prep part is crucial, however, as 75% of those items are hit or miss, depending on who is working in the kitchen. the 10% of those items that come prepared and are served \"as is\" are mostly condiments. but that's nothing to be ashamed of, since most chains nowadays make everything from a bag, box, or bottle. at least Moxie's uses fresh ingredients to de-blah otherwise bland foods, and has veered away from using microwaves.
having said that, i knew to order a salad since those ingredients are almost all fresh and its so apparent that they must well prepared to even touch a dining room table. i ordered the arugula and roasted beet salad with goat cheese and thought that it was tossed in just the right amount of dressing but could have used another ounce of goat cheese to be fairly priced. whereas Moxie's used to serve a mini loaf of banana bread (made from scratch) with their salads, i guess they opted to replace the carb component with a few too many greasy croutons. no matter, they were easily doffed to one side. generally, i was pleased with my \"entree salad\", which was freshly prepared, almost full of well-balanced ingredients (no \"filler\" greens), and indeed, large enough for a satisfying meal (you can also add a meat protein for a couple bucks). i would definitely order it again and request more cheese instead of any croutons.
another safe bet at Moxie's is the dough for pizzas and med bread. the pizzas are topped with good ingredients and consistently proportioned for good mouthful ratios of crust to filling. med bread is essentially pizza dough painted with a bit of oil to make herbs stick on as it bakes into a thin, crispy-edged, and softish-centered flat bread. it comes with three dips - 2 creamy, 1 tomato-based. 
i also like that glasses of wine can be ordered in two sizes, though the list could be expanded to include more variety, even at the same price point.
a week later, i ordered nearly the same thing for the same price at Milestone's (which shares location convenience with Moxie's, if it's not one \"M\", it's the other...) and was sorely disappointed."}
{"text":"Bad bad.  Had dinner there Thursday Dec.29,11, having been there lots before, couldn't have had worse food. Arctic char went back, chicken enchilada had sat so long on the counter the tacos they sat on were too soggy to lift, and the classic burger was burnt and cold, even a hungry tween couldn't push passed the mess.  Left it without eating it. The servers and kitchen staff seemed busy, in a disorganized way, and not at all surprised the food was bad.   Post Christmas is not an excuse, the mall was half empty at 6:30.  The bathrooms need to be totally gutted, broken taps and the woman sitting in the worn white leather chairs, in her underwear, changing from kitchen clothes ?, might want to be told to use a stall or a staff room!
We are short enough on good restaurants in the NW, maybe that is why Moxies can get away with poor standards."}
{"text":"I took the two littlest munchkins for lunch here today because I had a gift card to use up.  They love the idea of going anywhere to eat out for lunch because it's usually sandwiches at home for us, but today we had tons of errands and I decided to treat them.  I picked this Moxie's based on location for us.  

When we walked in it was quiet(around 11:20 am) and they seated us immediately.  The hostess set the kids up with crayons and we ordered drinks.  The kids menu was typical and in our price range.  Came with drink, entree, side and dessert.  I ordered the chicken pesto quesadilla with a side salad.  Our food was tasty and quick.  Our waitress was on the ball keeping the kids drinks refreshed. 

I think it's a newer location and it was kept nice and clean.  I liked the lighting and I was not made to feel like the kids didn't belong. 

My only issue is I cannot find the nutritional info online of what I had for tracking purposes, otherwise it was a great dining experience."}
{"text":"This was the first time my fiancé and I had gone to the Square One location of Moxie's. Typically the food is delicious and this location did not disappoint however our service was terrible. 

We came in Wednesday evening and thought we'd have dinner before our gruelling Christmas shopping. We were seated immediately and while it was bustling it was not insanely busy. We were waiting I don't know how long (maybe 15 minutes) for our server to get our drink order. She brought my Diet Pepsi almost immediately but my fiancé's beer took quite a bit longer. Strange that our drinks weren't brought together. When she brought his beer we had already chosen what we wanted to eat. Started with bruschetta, chicken Alfredo for me and the open faced steak sandwich. It was weird that we had to put together our own bruschetta but tasted great. A different server brought our mains and our original server seemed to be avoiding us. At one point my fiancé had made eye contact with her to try and ask for another beer but she high tailed it to the kitchen so I flagged down I'm guessing the manager. By the time things were said and done we've been there for 2 hours, which we did not want to be. Our server did not come to our table once but had no problem visiting her two other tables with the single guys. 
The experience was so terrible we lost our appetite and didn't even finish our dinner. 

We won't be going back to that location again. We have been to busier restaurants where we were actually treated well."}
{"text":"I went there in March... the food was ok... waiters and waiters a little bit showing off.
What I hated is that I was inviting some customers so we were a group of 10 or so... they included a tip (I don't like that but ok...), I didn't realize that, so I added a 20% tip on top of the 18% they already included and they let me do that in front of their eyes...
Not fair... = 1 star."}
{"text":"Can't make myself review a franchise
But i do prefer Moxies than most others"}
{"text":"Great place for a high standard restaurant without the high standard prices. My salmon was so moist and cooked medium rare like it should be.  Parking is a pain on Saturday night and service was a bit slow but this is what happens at a popular place on Saturday night."}
{"text":"No fresh vegetables with either meal ordered. Garlic bread was too crispy and had to exchange. Would not recommend for the price"}
{"text":"I've always considered moxies to be slightly ahead of the bunch of typical generic spots you can go drop money at. Heck I like taking dates there who I know will fall for that pretentiousness factor. I've justified it on a few occasions at other locations because I really could care less about the date and just wanted the white chocolate brownie in the moment. So here I am, we're driving around, my date and I in mississauga,  where to I ask? She wants drinks, she suggests moxies..oh great here we go again :$... ok I don't care to drink, it was my fault for not taking the lead with an initial suggestion but I'll do the white chocolate brownie. I've been in this scenerio before, I can make this work... This time I figured I'd indulge.. just bring me the platter of deserts miss waitress I'm going off tonight. So my plate comes out and I'm ready to get silly with it.. Low and behold my brownie didn't have any of the chocolate sauce on it.. I felt like I just found out my cat died... well I don't have a cat so I sucked it up and dove into the brownie... what the heck did I just put in my mouth? This is not the white chocolate brownie I've come to know and love... *sigh* the other stuff on the plate didn't make up for it either... moxies mississauga you scarred me of something I always felt was comfort food to me.. i dont know if  I could ever look at a white chocolate brownie with same passion I've had in the years before... Nope the loving feeling is gone.. sometimes you just can't heat up cold pizza.. I would have drank my sorrows away but the vodka cranberry drinks weren't gonna get me there or help get my date tipsy enough to talk her outta driving home. Damn you guys why did you skimp on our drinks, I would have forgave you for the desert thing and had drinks with you again.. you hurt my feelings with the cranberry juice incident... no second chances for you moxies mississauga, the love is gone. Nice bathrooms, the patio is decent with heaters 1 star for those things."}
{"text":"Good eye candy but don't expect good food.  Half my sandwich was soggy from the full uncut pickle.  Fries were undercooked and very salty. Great place for drinks and atmosphere but not for food"}
{"text":"Went here on a first date. Love the atmosphere. I like that you can go dressed up or casual. The food was good and hte service was friendly. Only a few downfalls. Didnt like how provocative the servers dressed, felt like I had to keep my date's attention. Also, my date wanted a certain dark ale, but they didnt have one, but said she had something similar, and brought a Canadian. He hated it. But the did redeam herself when she brought him a different beer after that he ended up liking. A little more pricey that I'd like, but I would definitly go back!"}
{"text":"Ok. It's Moxies. I didn't expect that much when I went this past Sunday for a bite to eat on the patio. They have a great location and a patio, so that was enough for me, or so I thought. The service was almost terrible. Very slow and inattentive. Our server recommended a \"pale ale\" they were serving was like a Keiths, so my friend and I ordered that. What came to the table was amber and much more dark than a keiths. I sent mine back. My friend drank his. 

After that non sense recommendation I should have know better than to listen to her advice on a \"honey garlic steak\". It sounded strange but she said it was great! What I ate was probably one of the worst steaks I've ever had. Also we shared a combo platter that was lack luster at best - the dips were the best part of that dish.

It got windy and our group was getting cold quite a while after we were done eating. Our plates were left on our table and we had to really flag someone down to pay the bill. Overall one of the worst experiences eating out I've had in a while. Will not be going back there again."}
{"text":"I ordered the Chicken Chipotle Quesadilla and it was good, but the chipotle yogurt dip that it came with was actually rather bland and gave an \"off\" flavour when pairing it with the quesadilla.

My sons ordered from the kids menu - one grilled cheese and one cheese pizza...both devoured!  The highlight of their meal was the anticipation of the ice cream dessert that is served over dry ice.  

Our waitress, Atlanta, was very friendly and accommodating.  The manager also stopped by our table to say hello and check that everything was going well.

Decor is dark and sophisticated.  A better destination for dinner with adults."}
{"text":"This was a favourite place to eat of ours until they began trying to cater to hipsters and yuppies (10-15 years ago).The food is now overpriced and the quality is hit and miss but usually sub-par at best.The servers are quite often pretentious, and occasionally a bit dumb."}
{"text":"Nice place to hang around with friends but nothing really special compared to other bars. A diversified cocktails list but I am more a fan for wines."}
{"text":"Reviewing a franchise is usually a dead waste of time. Unless said restaurant sucks so tremendously that you feel it is your citizen's duty to advise people away. 

  We NEEDED a drink on a patio that day and not willing to drive midtown for one we settled on this particular Moxie's...

The pros (listed only because I like to be generous):
  GREAT LOOKING PATIO! Nice tables, roomy, ample heat lamps, partially enclosed with glass to stop the wind from blowing your food away, generally the kind of patio that dream patios are made of.

THE CONS:
  Oh the food...We ordered BBQ pork ribs and fries and a couple of pints of beer. Fries were edible, ribs not so much. They were boiled and slathered with what tasted like bottled NO NAME BBQ sauce of the cheapest variety.  Also not really even heated on a grill, I know what BBQ meat tastes like and that wasn't it. To add to this disappointing meal, the draft beer was FLAT and there were some mysterious particles floating around in my glass. 

  I had to get a bottled beer after numerous failed attempts at clean glassware. Napkins were WELL used and fairly gross looking. 

  The staff had good attitude though and they tried to make the best of the situation. The only other thing that was a turn off was the fact that all the waitresses were extremely inappropriately dressed. 
  Although faced with the severity of the other problems this establishment had it didn't seem to matter quite as much. But really though, waitresses were wearing tights *cringe* or short skirts and very showy tops. Had I wanted to see female parts on display I would have headed to a different sort of establishment. Where the ladies do fun things, like twirl around a pole..."}
{"text":"Run far far away! I had forgotten why I stopped going to Moxies over the past 3 years, and my most recent experience was a huge reminder!

 JUST DON'T GO! At least not to this location. 

I recently visited the Square One location with two friends.  The waitress was very nice, and the atmosphere was what you'd expect to find at the keg, or pickle barrel. The food looked appealing, but definitely wasn't too great to eat. 

A friend of mine ordered the sirloin well-done and when it arrived, it was barely cooked /very under-done. When she sent it back, a second steak arrived that was just as under-cooked and, with an added fatty vein streaming through it. Yum right? 

At least her meal was complimentary but I found it odd that the manager, who I saw talking with our waitress, didn't even bother to acknowledge our table, especially after we had to send the second steak back to the kitchen.

Needlessness to say, she didn't eat anything other then the green beans, peppers and potatoes left on her plate.  I would have appreciated if she was offered the option to order something else free of charge, as well as an apology for the cook's inability to make a well-done steak even remotely correctly...twice. Basically, she ordered once, got two incorrect plates, and that was that was that, even after we spoke with our waiter about the errors.  

I ordered the maple salmon which burst into flakes of dryness the moment my fork touched it. Let's just say: it was not good! I ate what I could and drank my water, and the waters of my two friends. We had coffee at the end of our meal...and I KNOW my coffee. What showed up at our table might as well have been coffee scented water, because that's what it tasted like. 

Other than that, this place offers really over-priced food for a less than average menu, and staff who I saw spend more time breaking glasses and dished in the kitchen, then putting out quality service.

Maybe a different location (or a new set of staff at this location) would do the trick."}
{"text":"Came to meet with my girl for her birthday. It was pretty busy on Saturday but we got a back table in the bar. The atmosphere is very different than the other moxies I've been to with wooden planks and red booths. It definitely is more of a causal feel than the others. It has a great outdoor patio that's enclosed so that you can still enjoy it during the winter. The service was pretty slow but honestly it was the first whole week they've been open. We got the mosaic dip which was nice and creamy. It wasn't too overpowering with the goat cheese. We also shared the white chocolate brownie which was actually baked properly and warm throughout. I do hate how they plate it now though with the chocolate sauce on the bottom drenching it and lack of ice cream. I'd come back for sure as the waitress was really nice and it's local to my house. I'll see how their dishes measure up to the other locations."}
{"text":"If I could, I would put 0 stars. Wow.

Was sat down promptly, and waited almost 15 minutes for a waiter to take our order. 

We ordered the Korean Fried Cauliflower to start. Talk about inconsistency. At another Moxie's location, the cauliflower was fried, and there was the option of gochujang sauce and the lime dip on the side. At this location, however, the cauliflower was covered in gochujang sauce with the lime dip on the side. My fellow diner could not eat the majority of it because of a sensitivity to spicy foods.

We ordered the Salmon & Avocado Cobb Salad (no bacon due to dietary restrictions). When it came, it looked pathetic. The plate (not bowl!) was layered with maybe 1/3 of the iceberg lettuce cut at the bottom, 2 sliced cherry tomatoes (not listed as part of the salad), a dead-boiled egg, a pinch of feta, maybe 2 teaspoons of the dressing, 1/2 an avocado, and the piece of salmon was maybe 1 oz. My fellow diner said the same thing could be made for about $5, and the menu says this is $19.75. What a ripoff. The other thing is that it was deconstructed, and nowhere on the menu did it say that. This was returned, and after 10 minutes, another plate of the same salad, still on a plate, with romaine lettuce on the bottom, scattered to look like the base of a salad, came to our table. This was turned away as well.

I ordered the Red Thai Curry with Chicken. I had one bite of the naan - it tasted old. The curry itself wasn't bad, but I felt something was wrong with either the chicken or one of the vegetables, so I did not finish it.

After the bill was paid (the Cobb Salad was removed), I felt a little uneasy. We stopped somewhere and I found out that indeed, the curry made me sick.

Needless to say we will not be going there again. The only thing that was good was the coffee my fellow diner ordered."}
{"text":"Aside from the fact that we waited nearly an hour for our food, our steak was done wrong when it finally arrived to the table. When we brought it to the managers attention, he very unprofessionally brushed it off and put another steak on for us, which took another 40 minutes to be done. At that point everyone else at the table had finished their food and were ready to go. When they brought a new steak back, we asked for it to just be taken off the bill as at that point we wanted to leave because they took another 40 minutes to cook the steak but they insisted we take it to go and pay for it as it was already made for us. The manager then said he would take the steak off the bill but upon paying it turned out we had to pay for it and he gave us a moxies gift card instead. Pathetic excuse for a manager and terrible service. Will not be back. Very over rated place."}
{"text":"The food here was spectacular. The waitress was very friendly and speedy. Drinks and dessert were out of this world. 

Ordered the salmon and the mushroom burger. Would highly recommend this location."}
{"text":"Came here just for the White chocolate brownie. It came out within five minutes. Our waiter Krish was the best. Didn't want him to go through his whole specials speech and he was relieved. Sometimes the brownie can be hit out miss and I've had a few issues with this location and food but it was soft and warm. I could eat the whole thing myself but apparently sharing is caring. My review is based on Krish and the amazing brownie. However because the avocado spring rolls are gone, I had to take off a star. Bring it back! It's really the only app worth eating there.

Had to update my review. I forgot how slow the service can be here. Waited 20 minutes to just get our drink. And we ordered the brownie which wasn't plated the way it usually is and with no ice cream. Not impressed. I've had problems here at this moxies before where the manager has offered compensation. That's awesome but the good service needs to be consistent"}
{"text":"I love Moxies. I am a sexist pig but they are great at hiring waitresses everywhere. This one is no exception! We stopped in just for drinks and had nachos. They were really good, may have nachos more often at Moxies. The service was also very good. If you stay in the Sandman I would say stop by the Moxies for a meal or a drink"}
{"text":"Bah. I saw this sitting in my unfinished reviews and was like \"when did I go here?\" It was that unmemorable people.

Came here for drinks and dessert after a dinner with some friends, and the service was terrible. The place was less than half full, but our server barely stopped by so getting our first order in took over 15 minutes. We asked for a dessert menu at the time, but our drinks arrived before that menu did. We had to ask for it again. My friend also ordered a regular water, and 40 minutes later we were still asking for that glass of water. What!

The food is alright, the drinks are decent - but I would never want to go through that experience again. Longest dessert sit-through ever."}
{"text":"Went with a group of Co-workers on a Friday night...

They were great in accommodations for our group and friendly wait staff, for the most part. There was one waitress who seemed to have a bit of an attitude but, on a busy Friday night, I'm willing to overlook that. The service was a bit slow as well, but, again, I'm willing to chalk that up to a busy night. The food, though, it was average. $17.75 for nachos is steep, considering the amount that we got for that. The Backyard Burger wasn't bad, but it wasn't spectacular either... decent, and no napkins for any of the food that we were served and had to wait for the waitress to eventually return to ask for some and a glass of water, since I had a Jack and Coke, which was actually pretty good and a Stiegl Radler. I would also suggest to just turn the music down a tad bit and the ambiance would be great. I would go back in hopes to give a better review with more substance."}
{"text":"Supringsly Ive worked and lived in the area for years but never been to this location. Had a work lunch so my experience might be bias. Service was fast , quick and easy. The ambience was great and my food was delicious."}
{"text":"If I had read other people's reviews we would not have gone there. But we had not and we did.  Lunchtime, place was busy, seated straight away, charming and attentive waitress, food was really good. I had the sushi cones appetizer, followed by the mushroom ravioli, both of which were outstanding. Pleasantly surprised and would definitely recommend this restaurant based on our experience."}
{"text":"Had some relatives with a few hour-layover in Toronto, so we wanted to see the most of them and therefore go somewhere close to Pearson. Moxie's seemed like a good idea (not by me, though) because it could probably fit the ten of us. They told us they didn't take reservations but they do, just a limited amount. We showed up at 4 pm and they seemed super pissed to have to accommodate us.  I just got the general feeling the whole time no one wanted us there - not sure if it was our demographic or they knew we'd be there a while? We all drank the whole time and ordered food, so it's not like we were water drinkin squatters. 

I had the Greek chicken wrap (despite it being one of the highest calorie menu items for I'm not sure what reason!) and sweet potato fries. Fries were room temperature, but I tried some regular potato fries off someone else's plate and they were hot. 

There came a point in the evening that our server just stopped coming by and focused all her attention on other tables. More than once, one of us had to physically get up and go get her. 

Expensive for what it is and I hate how they right their prices on the menu (15 3/4), seems either pretentious or misleading, or maybe both!"}
{"text":"We tried this location of Moxies and were very disappointed with the service, not even a refill of water or ice tea. As for the meal, Sue ordered the \"unforgettable\" honey garlic sirloin steak with stuffed potato. When the server asked if Sue needed anything else, she asked for butter for the potato which never came. She's comment on the \"unforgettable\" steak was that its forgettable.

I enjoyed my Madagascar peppercorn steak however the service is terrible so we will not be coming back."}
{"text":"On what seemed to be one of the final remaining sunny days of 2011, I thought I'd give Moxie's a whirl for lunch, since I was at Bramalea City Center. I had visited their Square One location many moons ago, but damned if I can remember anything from that visit. 
Anyway, I parked myself on the patio and really soaked up some good sun. Really comfy chairs, nice tables, and really spacious made for one of the better patios I've been on.

And I'm sorry, but its gotta be said: The servers here (and their corresponding uniforms) are ridiculously hot. Friendly too.

I ordered their 'loaded' burger and fries, and one of their beer specials from that day. I am normally extremely picky when it comes to beer, but my server seemed pretty confident that I'd like it, and the price was dirt-cheap, so what the hell.

To be honest, I would have expected the 'loaded' burger to frankly be a little more loaded. The mushrooms were cooked perfectly and the burger, while not very thick, was tasty and well complimented with their BBQ sauce and bacon, but there really wasn't many mushrooms on it, which was a little disappointing. I'm starting to find that the burgasm tour is a blessing and a curse, because the whole time while eating this thing, I thought to myself \"almost 15 dollars for THIS? I could get 3 huge and delicious burgers from C & Dubbs for that\"...not a good sign.
I don't want to completely spank this burger though. It was tasty and I'd definitely eat it again, I just don't know if the cost is justified. The fries were also very good, and I enjoyed the mayo-dip concoction they give you for them. The beer was also a winner. Very tasty!

When on a trip to the men's room, I noticed the interior of the place. Seemed like a very classy and relaxed atmosphere, and while I didn't regret sitting outside, I think I'd have enjoyed myself just as much indoors.

As for the men's room...is it wrong if this was the highlight of my visit? Wow! By far the classiest crapper I've ever went into! Not only spotless, but the huge fireplace in there is very welcoming, and each urinal had its own personal satellite TV. All that was missing was a computerized voice thanking you for your urinary deposit. Very impressed.

Ok, so it's high-priced, hindering potential visits on a financially tight day. For a chain, I was very impressed with the quality of the place and its employees, and pretty satisfied with the food. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant for dinner and it was run terribly! We ordered our food after asking if we could receive our food in 30 minutes or less. They assured us we would receive our food quickly but we were still waiting for our food one hour later. 

It was really difficult to get the waitresses attention to even fill our water glasses. Around the one hour mark we were able to get our waitresses attention and told her we had not receive our meals yet. They asked what we had ordered and brought out the incorrect orders 15 minutes later. My friend ordered two normal chicken tacos and they came out with 4 fish tacos for him (two of which were mine made incorrectly). I ordered three gluten and dairy free fish tacos and they only brought me one taco, which looked really puny. My other friend ordered vegetarian tacos and her order was made incorrectly as well. 

The waitress said they would let my friend keep the extra tacos and they rushed to remake mine and the other girls tacos. I appreciate their eagerness to fix the order but by the time I received my other two tacos, it was an hour and a half after we placed the order. We officially missed the Canada Day fireworks, which we were planning to watch with other friends. 

We were quite disappointed. The waitress tried to make us feel better by saying she missed the fireworks as well since she was working. That didn't make us feel better. She was getting paid to be there and we were not.

They did comp some of the items off of each of our individual bills, which made me feel a bit better but I really don't think I'll be returning to this location again."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming to this location, as well as the one at Yorkdale, both of which are extremely busy. Every time that I've come to this location later in the evening, there has been a long wait. You may be fortunate to catch customers leaving the lounge if you are persistently walking around. Before 6, there shouldn't be a wait, from my experience. This review will be a combination of this particular location, and the franchise itself.

Moxie's is my fave franchise. They have some classic menu items. I generally stick to what I know I like, unless I'm really in the mood for something else. Ever since i have tried their Sushi Cones, I have been hooked. For a small add-on, you can add a 4th cone. My favourite entree is the Ginger Teriyaki Rice Bowl. Everything about that dish is amazing. The rice is honestly the best I've ever had (what kind of rice is it... I have to ask next time..). There is a generous amount of chicken every time (at least I can say this for this location), so much so, that I always want more rice, and there is also a plentiful amount of delicious vegetables. It is one of the most satisfying meals for me. I would recommend getting the sauce on the side, because at this location I find there is too much sauce, and so there ends up being not enough rice. However, if you get it on the side, you can completely avert this issue. 

I don't think there is anything I have tried at Moxie's that I have not liked. I don't expect all of the dishes to be as outstanding as my favourite ones, but Moxie's does a great job. I used to order the salmon sandwich, which was my favourite item of the time (I can also speak for other people I know), but sadly they removed it :( I was also crazy about the Pom Mango Mojito, which was also sadly removed.. Since that time, I have never had anything as out of this world good as that drink. One thing that I should point out that Moxie's also does right is their menu selection. The menu is well organized and substantial, catering to many different tastes and preferences. Online, you can also easily view the Gluten Free Menu, etc. 

The desserts at Moxie's are always consistent and yummy, but I've had them all so much that I'm tired of them. They have removed my fave banana one, warm banana in a delicious pastry with vanilla ice cream and caramel. I like that they have special Holiday menu out every season, which spices things up. They also have a new brunch menu, which I will have to try. 

One thing I really have to give kudos for for is the layout. The split between lounge (self-seating) and dining are (all booths!) is both unique and practical for the franchise. As well, if there is room at the bar, that is an option. The acoustics here are good as well, particularly the dining area. If I go to Earls next door, I can hardly hear the person I am with, unless it not peak hours. 

Like I stated earlier, this location is always very busy. I have always had great customer service. One time I couldn't locate my server for a while, and called over the manager to place my order (not even complain), and he apologized and provided my wine refill for free. Some of the servers are really nice and make the experience that much better."}
{"text":"I had a great time here. Came with a group of friends and the service was quick efficient and very friendly. Not only was the food visually appealing, it was also delicious. Very down to earth and business-casual atmosphere, I definitely recommend for a nice relaxing dinner. 

Ps, you might want to make a reservation ahead of time if you plan to go on a weekend"}
{"text":"I came here the other day and it was an okay experience. My friend and I sat down in the bar section of the restaurant and it took forever to get our waitress to come over and take our orders. Once she placed our orders, it took over an hour for our food to arrive.

The service was incredibly slow and the food was just average. Everyone in the bar area was encountering the same problem. The sign should have been the other tables trying to get the waitresses attention to pay their bills when we arrived. 

Once we were ready to leave it took another 30-40 minutes to get our bill.  My friend and I feel like we wasted a lot of time at this restaurant for just mediocre food. I definitely won't be going back to eat at this location if and when I am hungry at Yorkdale mall."}
{"text":"This location is a solid three stars. I came here with a friend and we sat in the bar section so we could dine on a meal and enjoy watching the Raptors Game (We won!) and it was a really good experience. 

We ordered the guacamole and chips shareable and it was significantly smaller than we imagined it would be. My friend then ordered the steak entrée and I ordered the gluten free fish tacos. The fish tacos were delicious! They had a radish salsa on top and were very flavourful. It was also really cool that I was able to order fish tacos at a restaurant. Usually, the fish is fried and contains gluten but this dish was gluten free and really good. I appreciate the waitress suggesting it to me. My friend also really enjoyed his steak dinner. 

We looked at the dessert menu but weren't able to order anything as none of the desserts were both gluten and dairy free. 

Allover, we had a good time and I might return to this location to watch another game. It wasn't too crowded and the TV's were a good size."}
{"text":"A friend and I decided to enjoy their $2.99 wing special last night. We arrived around 9pm and it was very slow, there was maybe 3 other tables. We waited very long just to be seated so we decided to seat ourselves. We then waited another 5mins before anyone had realized we were there. The bartender finally came over and took our drink order. We had the mosaic dip and 2lbs of wings which took way too long considering how slow it is, no excuse. We decided to get more Naan bread for the dip and another pound each of wings. I understand wings taking some time to come out but we waited 10mins almost for a piece of bread which is ridiculous. Finally the bread comes out, shortly after that our wings come out as well. One pound was too saucey and the other pound had very little sauce. Thinking we could end the night off on a good note, we decided to get the white chocolate brownie. We waited over 15mins for that and we almost cancelled the dessert at that point. When it finally came out, my friend asked what took so long. Our server claimed that the first one burnt because it seemed like all the employees were doing their own thing. I love going to Moxies but I will not be going back to this location."}
{"text":"Sorry, Moxie's, but I've eaten better at Harveys.  

I went to Moxie's with a great friend of mine and thank goodness for good conversation, because that was the by far the best part of our meal.  We went at lunchtime on a weekday and I must admit I should have been alerted that something was amiss by the way the waitstaff and hostesses were dressed.  The atmosphere was much more late-night danceclub than daytime lunch crowd.  It was almost like the restaurant management was trying to \"dazzle\" us (um...distract us?) with fancy lighting and tight skirts so we wouldn't notice how overcharged we were being.

We ordered sweet potato fries to start and then salads.  The fries were okay - nothing special but nothing bad.  It was while we were eating our fries, though, that the waitstaff started their campaign of giving us drink refills.  So many refills!  It was a little aggressive, actually.  Neither of us wanted more than one drink, but every waiter that passed us by offered us a refill.  When we said no, they just starting bringing them to the table (which promped us to speculate whether there was something in the coke that they REALLY wanted us to be drinking....)
 
Our salads came and my friend said hers was good (hence the two stars), but mine was horrible.  Salmon that was overcooked and fishy-smelling at the same time, mixed lettuce that included some rotting leaves, mango that had clearly been frozen and then unfrozen so it had a mushy, watery texture, and not much else.  

Total bill for two?  $57.  

Two days ago I stopped at a Harveys with my husband at a roadside stop and the salad I had was fresher and tastier.  For $2."}
{"text":"Night out with bf. We both ordered steaks, I chose the sirloin with med-rare and he had New York with medium. My sirloin didn't look like overcooked but still pretty chewy...my bf's new york was better than mine.

But I had to say that if you are going to order steak there, then their mashed potato is a must! It was a baked potato stuffed with mashed potatoes mixed with cream cheese, onion and bacon - so yum! One star for this great side dish."}
{"text":"In town for business and ordered the chicken siracha sandwich. It was super delicious and very tender. Would defiantly order again. The fries however were under cooked and not edible. The sandwich again would make me come back for sure."}
{"text":"This is probably my go to place where I meet up with my girlfriends last minute. Its kind of ridiculoue because some of the servers know me and always say \"You look familiar\". Damn right, giving them business :p the decor is chic and and classy and most importantly clean. The staff is friendly and I am always greeted and I never have to wait for a table, in both bar and dining area. I usually start off with a bottle if Trius wine. On the summer patio nights, I usually grab their Sangria or Long Island. Its usually always happening and I end up spending 2-3 hours and not even notice. To start I grab 2 apps out of the calamari, chili chicken, sweet potato fries & bruschetta, their all good. For main, I usually get the chicken enchilladas but when I want something light but filling I get the santorini or steak salad. Just the other day I was recovering from a hang over so I had their spicy gumbo soup which was pretty good. For dessert they have their popular white chocolate brownie, but I think the brownie is too dry or its just my luck, not really a fan. I normally get a mocha latté and call it a night. I like this place mainly for drinks and apps :)"}
{"text":"One of those restaurants you go to when you can't decide where to eat. Not my favourite place, but they have pretty good food.

A pretty good ambiance overall, with the choice to sit in the dining room or the bar side. (Note that on busier nights, they will check ID's in order to sit on the bar side).

Typically, I end up getting a steak, but depends who I go with. Luckily went with my parents the last time, so was able to get the honey glazed steak. It was AMAZING, well cooked at medium rare, and juicy!

Service is decent most times, though I did have a pretty bad experience once a few years ago with the hostess, but the manager ended up giving us a free appetizer."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my time at Moxies on a busy Wednesday (1/2 priced bottles of wine!!) mostly because of the waitstaff. Sana was our primary waitress and she was able to recommend a meal for my coworker with dietary restrictions with dexterity due to her deep knowledge of the menu. She was polite and knowledgeable but didn't hover over us. Her coworkers that brought our meals out (meal runners?) were also very accommodating and helpful - one woman who wasn't our waitress came back twice to drop off silverware and condiments. I was so pleased with the experience since it was a busy patio season night. The steak on my steak salad was not amazing but perhaps it had been under a heat lamp - I still ate it! - but the sweet potato fries I ordered as a small slide were awesome; and my coworker loved her recommended meal so I'd definitely go back (and would request Sana again!)."}
{"text":"Always had a great time at Moxie's. I like this one because it's got a great intimate and energetic vibe. Great south facing patio too!"}
{"text":"I used to come here quite often but lately it's become a last choice option when shopping at the mall and I don't want fast food.  The bathroom is falling apart, door handles broken off, tiles coming off the walls, toilet stalls out of toilet paper and a turd floating in the bowl.  The soap dispenser at the sink isn't even working, someone had just run to the local Target and bought a pump hand soap you'd find in your home bathroom. Then I ordered my steak sandwich which doesn't need to come with all of those ridiculous extras, onions? Tomato? Arugula? Disgusting aioli sauce...yuck.  And when I am being charged $17 for a steak and fries I expect it to be damn good.  Not the size of a boiled egg.  Like c'mon, this thing couldn't have been more than 4 ounces of meat and you charged me how much?! Service was slow but that's to be expected from someone who was hired for her looks and not brains.  I will not be returning here, restaurant is dirty, gross and rundown, the food needs a serious overhaul and the staff need some training in better customer service."}
{"text":"Surprised that this location has as high a star rating as it has. Was with a party of eight for after work drinks, apps & dinner and was very underwhelmed. The decor is nice, washrooms clean and it's spacious but the food and drinks aren't very good. Except for the wine everyone complained about their cocktails (lacked flavour, was warm, watered down). The apps were better, tuna poke, goat cheese & mushroom with flatbread and sushi wraps. I didn't care for my entree of herbed salmon, everyone else seemed to like their steaks.  I think for the money there's better options out there and lots in Mississauga. It's a shame because I hadn't been to Moxies in awhile and I just felt underwhelmed. However I could be in the minority as I was surprised how many people were there on a Tuesday night. Still my rating is 2/5"}
{"text":"One of the better moxie's. The food quality and service is usually up to par."}
{"text":"One of the things that always makes me come to this location over others in the city is the diligence, dedication, and detail-oriented service offered by staff like Travis at this location. If my friends and I are fortunate to come to the restaurant when Travis is working, we know we can truly relax and enjoy ourselves knowing that Travis' quality of service will never have us waiting for orders or even to order. Given its proximity to downtown, this is a great place for after work meetups but it's truly staff like Travis, who remembered favourite drink orders after only a few visits that make the best impression for this location."}
{"text":"Good casual place for food or drinks.  

There is a lounge upstairs and the menu is fairly extensive.  Prices are very reasonable and atmosphere is relaxed.  Service is friendly and in the over 20 times I've been here I cant recall a bad experience.  Not the place to go if you are looking for a more formal dining experience, but for a casual meal/drinks its perfect."}
{"text":"I hate to give it this many stars because it took such a big chunk out of my wallet the night I visited but you have to hand it to Moxies their restaurants are consistently awesome.

Aside from every waitress being gorgeous, they also provide relatively good service. We did find ourselves waiting a few times but it was okay because we just sat and watched the lovely ladies prancing about doing their thing :P

The food was really good also. I was there on a secret shopper mission with a friend so I decided to go all out. I ordered a steak, a side skewer of mushrooms (which is not what I thought it was), and a amaretto sour (moxy-sized). Steak was delicious, nothing special though. The skewer of mushrooms was not like a shish-kabob of mushrooms rather a whole little pan of them! And the moxy-size Amaretto sour was a well made (giant) drink.

Best part of Moxies: the cozy-a$$ washrooms! They come with TV's at every urinal and a fireplace! That being on top of the fact that they are incredibly clean and just generally beautiful works of art.

Moxies is living proof of once of my favorite concepts: if you command respect you will receive respect. That is exactly what they do."}
{"text":"The kale and quinoa salad was excellent! Very filling, satisfying complimented with chicken breast. The flavours were subtle yet pleasing. Just the right amounts of lemon vinaigrette, and ingredients. Service was awesome too!"}
{"text":"I have to admit I've never loved this chain in the past but today I was pleasantly surprised! Great service, over and above, custom orders and changes and requests and everything done promptly and with a smile! (Thanks to Lauren and the others we harassed along the way...)

I ordered the cauliflower appy and I wasn't expecting much but holy! This tastes exactly like boneless wings! The mint based dressing to dip the wings in was a little strange but was good!
The guacamole they pounded in an ice chilled mortar right in front of us!!! I got the pene pasta but had them serve it with the seafood from the seafood linguine, no problem! AND IT WAS DEEEEELICIOUS! I also ordered TWO desserts and had them for a midnight snack. Yes I'm a pig, who cares!

Everything was AMAZING - the service, the food, the drinks... I loved it! I couldn't believe how good everything was, as I used to prefer Joey or even Earls over and above this chain, but wow! Good job Moxie's, you finally caught up!"}
{"text":"Food: 7/10 -- Value: 4/10 -- Service: 10/10 -- Ambiance/Décor: 9/10

Would I come again? Maybe if it's the most convenient place for a group meal.

It's Moxie's, so there's a dependable standard of food and prices. Because I wasn't very hungry, I opted for a salad and as salads at American restaurants tend to be, it was very expensive. My salmon and avocado cobb salad was $17.75 before tax and tip. I get that they kind of stacked things that typically jack up the price at any restaurant (salmon, bacon, eggs, avocado), but the essence of the dish is very simple. It straddles the line between too expensive and reasonable because the piece of salmon was decently sized, but you realize that the things on top disguise how the lettuce underneath is just an eighth of a head of lettuce. Conflicted. 

You get a bit of lettuce on the bottom, feta(?), cherry tomatoes, avocado, egg, salmon, and bacon. To be honest, it was tasty. The dressing was a bit overpowering and there was maybe too much cheese or the chunks were too big. The salmon was moist, bacon crispy, eggs soft. Dressing aside, everything went well together. The avocado was a tad overripe as you can see it was beginning to get spotty, but it tasted fine.

The atmosphere and restaurant setup was nice. I enjoyed the dim lighting with lights at the individual tables. Bright enough near the center of the table that you can see everything you're eating clearly and dim enough everywhere else that you can lean back and relax in the \"shade\" a bit. 

Service was outstanding. Our server was Darek and he balanced checking up on us and giving us our space perfectly. I've also never had someone replace our water so many times without us asking. After we finished eating, we stayed for quite a while to chat and catch up, and we never got the impression from Darek that he wanted us gone. Even while we were just chatting, he replaced our waters a few times without us asking, which is rare because most waiters ignore you after your meal is done; they just want you to pay and leave. He was fantastic. 

The prices make me hesitate a little and the options aren't that exciting, but the food is dependable, service was excellent, and the location is really convenient."}
{"text":"Are there any managers that work here? I came in yesterday afternoon and I could see that it was not operating well. The servers seemed to be running around without much leadership, as it felt very frantic. Working in the restaurant industry myself, I know that there should at least be some kind of presence on the floor from a supervisor so things run smoothly. That's really my only complaint about this location, otherwise i would have rated way higher. It kind of brought down the atmosphere, unfortunately.

Aside from the supervisor on shift not caring about their staff enough to help out, the food was great(I had a burger), as was the service(didn't catch my servers name, but they were great). I would give the place another visit based on those alone, but you guys really need to step it up in the management department and start to... I don't know...Care?"}
{"text":"We stopped at this Moxie's for a late lunch before a BBQ on a rainy Saturday, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that they still had their brunch menu.

Atmosphere:  4/5  This Moxie's was located inside Market Mall which was a convenient location.  Overall clean and neat; the washrooms were definitely interesting with its high-end feel.  We were seated in a booth and were able to work on the computer without being too loud or quiet.

Food: 3.5/5  I had the smoked salmon and egg white omelette minus goat cheese, which came with toast and fruit.  I liked the egg white only option and it was a good portion size.  We were also given some brioche french toast to try on the house which was warm and nice, but a little sweet for me with the syrup.  Overall good.

Service: 4/5  Server was attentive and friendly; food arrived within a reasonable amount of time.

Price: 3.5/5 Reasonably priced and standard for Moxie's

Overall: 3.5/5  Overall satisfactory Moxie's experience."}
{"text":"This week alone, my co-workers and I have been at the restaurant 3 times. The food and service are outstanding. Our waitress (Jasmine) did a wonderful job taking care of our table. I highly recommend the Honey Garlic Sirloin. The Butcher's Cut Steak Sandwich was really good too."}
{"text":"Meh.
Don't bother.. Montreal has a ton of great restaurants that aren't chains.
Moxies has a very large menu with tons of different kinds and styles of food. However this is usually a sign of a mediocre restaurant. Couldn't tell you what they specialise in.. or what they \"claim\" their speciality is.
Decore was fine. However very brightly lit. Not a fan of that.

Other notes, Waitress brought me a 3/4 filled pint. Weak pour. The staff is mostly young girls that are probably working their first jobs. Service was fine in terms of time.
I ordered the burger (i mostly order cheap and average meals at restaurants i assume aren't great) that they would only cook well done. It was however not dry. But was very average. These kind of restaurants try to hide the fact their burgers aren't great by putting it on a gourmet looking kieser bun. Your not fooling me. 


All in all. If you want to go eat at a chain restaurant and pay average food at a slight higher. Thats all you'll get. Save up your money and go to somewhere that has better food and specializes in something.

I can see how these restaurants survive in the rest of Canada but not sure it will be around long in a city like Montreal that has tons of hidden gem restaurants.

Cheers"}
{"text":"After a while, these places all start to look the same: Earls, Moxies, Cactus Club, Joey Tomatoes. I think they must have the same interior designers. I'm not saying it's bad but it's just not that original. 

My friend was staying at the Sandman next door so we popped over for supper tonight. The place was actually fairly busy, perhaps because the hotel was full. I ordered the chicken ranch burger which was quite tasty. My friend had the mango chicken with rice. She said it was good and I'll take her word especially since she had it 2 days ago. The drinks seem a bit small and what I found really strange was that they serve margaritas, daiquiris and most other drinks in tall skinny glasses. It's impossible to stir a slushy drink in one of those glasses. Sorry to be so critical but the glass a drink is served in makes a difference. We decided to share the white chocolate brownie, even though I don't care for white chocolate. It was topped with both ice cream and whipped cream. And I actually thought it was good, not like most white chocolate I've had. More like a white dense cake.

The service was pretty good other than our desert seemed to take longer than our entrees. You get what you expect at Moxie's. What more can I say?"}
{"text":"I usually go to restaurant because of their main dish, however Moxie has the best white chocolate brownie. We started going here on a regular basis just for the desert and soon came to know each of the serve's names. They are so friendly and welcoming, sometimes we feel like going just to see them. This is a amazing location, with great service. I would not change anything about the high quality customer service this location gives."}
{"text":"Earls, Moxies, Joeys, they're all pretty much the same thing. Nothing really sets them apart from each other. Your visit often depends on what you order and your server. Last night, I was way down south at the Moxie's in Signal Hill. For a Saturday night it was totally dead, most likely because of the long weekend. 

My friend and I sat inside on the restaurant side. We were seated in the area that looked like an enclosed in sun room. There was a fountain right in the doorway that was filled with white rocks, not a drop of water. Strange. The wait staff is young like most of these places. Our server was pretty attentive but when it came time to pay the bill, it seemed like we were rushed. She barely dropped off the bill and next thing you know she was there asking for payment. We hadn't even looked at it. That kind of put a damper on things. Then what was really weird was when the manager came over to ask how everything was. He kept thanking us for coming out and said to enjoy the rest of our weekend. That was odd.

I ordered the chicken chipotle quesadilla which comes with a small salad. It was ok but mainly filled with onions, both red and green. I was a bit disappointed. And I would have preferred sour cream to dip it in not the weird spicy sauce they gave me. My friend had this big ass burger that he said was very good but messy. The slushy belini I also ordered was very good.

the menu has a wide selection with something for everyone. Don't set your expectations too high and you should be ok."}
{"text":"i've only had the seared ahi salad here, 2x.  and it's amazing!  i didn't think a bar and grill would have such great presentation / plating for salad but they do and it tasted delicious.

food menu comes with a lot of asian inspired fusion items.

drink menu comes with a lot of delicious sounding drinks from the full bar.

restaurant comes with a lot of scantily clad women in short mini black dresses with long flowing hair.

good thing the food is good!  will definitely come back again for the salad :)"}
{"text":"Had a last minute planned dinner with the girls today and we had a nice time in the lounge area.

Drinks were good, food was good, conversation was flowing, just an overall good night and atmosphere.

Service was good as well, didn't have to wait long and our server came by to attend whenever needed.  Also came to check on us time to time.

We ordered different apps, got the tuna poke jar, med bread, dry ribs and sushi cones...all good.  I loved my steak salad...the steak had so much flavour and was so tender, dressing was perfect acidic and sweet flavour.

It has been awhile since I was at Moxies before, but it's a good contender for another ladies night."}
{"text":"Busy on Friday night. Penny
Is good. My friends ordered salmon and steak. The salmon is great while steak is too hard."}
{"text":"I would not recommend going to this location. I ate at the Yorkdale location a while back and asked for them to recommend me their best steak as it was my first time. They gave me the Honey Garlic Steak and I fell in love. Unfortunately, when I dined at this location, my steak was over cooked which is ironic considering the server describes the amount of pink you will see inside your steak when you order it, then you receive something completely different from what he/she said. My \"medium\" steak was more cooked than my boyfriend's \"medium-well\" steak. Might I add that there was no sauce on my Honey Garlic steak. The restaurant was pretty well empty, so I had expected that they would at least spend a little extra time and care cooking the food. Overall, bad experience. Wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"To start the night off our appetizer came out stone cold... They seemed quite busy with bigger groups that night. My main dish was supposed to include 1/2 a baby lobster tail which it did not... I mentioned that to a passing waiter and was just told it is supposed to be there. I think I can notice a lobster tail. The whole dish was cold as it had sat somewhere for a long time which could explain the long wait. The cheesecake for desert wasn't to my liking either. I make cheesecake at home quite a bit and much prefer what I can make at home. The only positive note was our main server."}
{"text":"Hostess forgot to take our name so causes some confusion.  Waited 35 minutes for appetizer and 45 minutes for a burger and a salad.
Food was mediocre.
Server was friendly and apologetic."}
{"text":"This place was great.  I judged because it was in the mall and I don't do mall food =/.  But my friends were taking me to \"their spot\" and said they liked it here, I compromised.

The service was amazing.  I didn't understand as an American that a single meant, they only poured 1 shot of alcohol per drink.   

That shit is hilarious.  Anyway it was great, I did noy like the dryrub ribs.  They were fried and not well seasoned.  But then again, I also thought dry ribs, just meant dry rub ribs.  So meh."}
{"text":"I went here for after work drinks on the patio. The patio is pretty good, relatively comfortable and somewhat shielded from the super winds up here. Some of my coworkers had food that they all seemed pretty happy with (steak salad, arugula salad, veggie spring rolls, tuna tartar and brownie). 

We all had margaritas (Tuesday special), and they were decent.

The service was incredibly slow near the end, it took us a while to flag our server, then about half an hour to get our bill."}
{"text":"Was looking for a Steakhouse in Downtown Toronto without the price affair associated with some of the top tiered steakhouses. A good middle ground was heading to Moxies. Never actually went to the place before so it was a very pleasant experience. Approaching the restaurant the logo and the restaurant with large glass pane windows greet you upon entry. Upon walking into the restaurant, you see the bar with multiple screens and a lush green backdrop that shines some life into the restaurant with some high ceilings.

There were some other patrons there, but we were soon greeted by our waiter and got seated quite quickly. We got sat at a booth; our menus presented to us with the drink menu.

I ended up going for their Honey Garlic Sirloin 9oz Steak done medium rare with their seasonal mixed vegetables, substituting their typical side with sweet potato fries. Unfortunately, I was not able to substitute the seasonal vegetables to something I would usually get in San Francisco with Kale and Quinoa, but that was somewhat expected. As a drink, I ended up ordering the French red wine which would be a pretty good pairing with the steak.

Upon receiving the entree it, the presentation of the food was as you would come to expect. Tasting the steak it was done correctly as a medium rare being very juicy and tasted good. The broccolini was crisp and not overcooked. The sweet potato fries were seasoned well and had compliments of ketchup and mayo on the side. 

After finishing our entree, the dessert menu got presented. My friend and I both ended up sharing the sampler trio which had the white chocolate brownie, caramel toffee, and banana bread with vanilla ice cream on the side. Out of the three, I would recommend the white chocolate brownie. Not to be surprised with a regular brownie it melts as you take a bite and pairs exceptionally well with the vanilla ice cream.

Overall I would say it's the steak is good and white chocolate brownie is something to get. I would say that the place is on the pricey side, but still, a good time when you go."}
{"text":"So0o0o delicious. Beautiful facilities with a courteous staff who is always at your service. All meals ordered at the table were beautifully presented and tasted as good as they looked. A nice drinks menu to chose from as well. 
Would definitely return."}
{"text":"We had a work dinner yesterday at Moxie's, we had a reservation for 12 people. The waitress seemed confused but did bring our food and drinks correctly. We had appetizers, main dishes drinks and coffee and right after coffee (I was still drinking my tea) the waitress came back with the bill a message to leave as they had the table taken. We were there around 2 hours beginning to end (which is normal for a dinner but we were still thinking about having at least one drink at least).
This is incredibly rude, they have lost our business. I already forgot if the food was good or not, the only thing that I remember now is the terrible service. I have to add that the place wasn't packed... there many free tables. 
Such a shame..."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere! Incredible food. Very attentive service. I ordered the ginger teriyaki bowl with chicken. It was very tasty and perfectly sized. The local Amber Alert was very smooth and easy to drink. The bartender was one of the prettiest women I've seen in Canada. The male bartender who also waited on me was a lucky guy. Will definitely return whenever I come back to the Toronto area."}
{"text":"Great place for drinks and that's about it. I recently ordered their chicken enchiladas  because it was recommended by the server when asked for an entree that was filling. Considering the $16 price tag, I would have expected a good portion of chicken. Unfortunately, the filling had little taste and even less protein! Even the scoop of guacamole tasted like it was ordered in!"}
{"text":"Meh! Came here for drink only. The food at these chain restaurants have me craving food court specials."}
{"text":"just to be clear, this is not a place I would normally go to. I was taken out and moxies was the only available option on valentines day - yes, I know not particularly classy, but hear me out. The restaurant is located at he hotel and not the best hotel I should say. The clientele was looking a bit cheap or casual. The food, however, was quite good. I had a steak and I could not fault it in any way. So the moral is, one can get decent food in such place without breaking the bank. I think it was $30 or $35 per person for three courses - probably special price for Valentines day."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out after work. Love their salmon, peach Bellini is good to try too."}
{"text":"Still a 5 star second time around Service, food, and atmosphere was an all around great experience. Patios are now open and the perfect time to indulge in a refreshing Mexican Bulldog. Had the Mango Chicken and was not dissappointed, I was surprised at how large the portion was. Healthy never tasted so good !"}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant, with a choice of dining in the dining room or lounge. Two separate atmospheres under one roof :). We chose the lounge side. There were tvs, high comfortable pub tables with fur on the chairs - so cute! The service was awesome as we had 3 waiters :). That sounds like a bit much, but it was a great experience! The drinks were pr and the food was delicious! I would definitely recommend going here if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I come to this Moxie's often with my girlfriends. The feel is the same as the other Moxie's in the area. Very classy and sleek look, if you want a girls night it's definitely a good place.

They have alot of variety of foods from noodles, to pasta, to burgers and rice. They didn't have a whole lot of veggie options but there was a lot of flexibility to play with the meat dishes and take some protein out. The veggie burger was my favorite, super soft. 

We went on a busy Saturday night. Our waitor kept forgetting about our table, we kept having to ask for water and cutlery and other things they're supposed to know right away. 

We also had a birthday girl, and they gave a free cheesecake that says happy birthday on the plate, which was cute."}
{"text":"Another somewhat higher-end chain restaurant which originates out west. Places such as: Cactus Club, Earl's, The Keg, Milestones and Joey's all seem to be thriving out here and were a bit ahead of the curve in offering more eclectic fusion-based, slightly higher-end menus and hipper atmosphere than most of the chain restaurants that had been established earlier. Even 10 years ago when I was just visiting the area, there wasn't much available outside the downtown core other than Kelsey's, Jack Astor's and Swiss, etc...

With that preamble out of the way, Moxie's is very nicely decorated - and automatically one of the nicer restaurants in town by virtue of little competition in that regard.

Service on the night I was there was comfortably a 5. We informed our server we were a bit rushed and she accommodated us all along the way. My wife chose a wine she ended up not really enjoying, and they took it back without complaint. The waitress then provided 3 samples to help her make her choice. I wish I could remember the server's name, because she deserves an honourable mention.

The menu was diverse and I went of a southwestern-flavoured chicken dish and my wife had ribs. The ribs were great and my meal was good though I feel it could've had more spice.

I would say value was the low point, and they've seem to have gone up another level in terms of price range. I think they're food offerings have also gone up in quality (and cost) but the jump was still higher than I expected. I doubt they're worried about it however, since it was 3/4 full on a Thursday.

A nice place which has something for everyone and really not a great deal of competition in Brampton."}
{"text":"Wonderfully decorated place, but I've had better experiences at other locations. It may not be a fault of this location so much, but I wasn't too impressed with what I, or my wife ordered (well, we split everything anyways).

My wife ordered the fish tacos. There was a choice of fried or baked. I appreciate that the server described the preparation well, and he said that the baked option was indeed simply baked - not pan fried or with any type of sear on the fish. I find that a bit odd, as pan-searing fish tacos is a common (and IMO better) preparation. There wasn't too much special about the fried fish, and the tacos had way too much lettuce. In fact, the fish barely fit into it and the lettuce dominated the taste.

I ordered the burger. I appreciated the beef quality and the side salad was good - but there could've been more taste to the burger, whether it would be more seasoning or an interesting sauce.

From this visit, the meals were still okay due to good quality ingredients, but the preparation kept the meal pretty average. I was happy with the service though."}
{"text":"My friend is in love with Moxie's so that made me set the bar pretty high. My friend boasted greatly about there  orgasmic mouth watering meals and I was down for an experience of my own. $90CAN later I felt unsatisfied and my mouth was pretty dry. Full details below

We were a party of two and visited on a Friday night after 9 PM. The wait was about 15 minutes. 

Ambiance:  This is a chain restaurant similar in style to Cheesecake Factory and Bistro Italian eateries back in the states. Nice, dim lighting with a dark decor which is suitable for intimate dining as well as large parties. We sat in a booth that accommodated 4. They also offer dining in the bar lounge. 

Menu & Food: They offer a variety of \"international\" items on the menu similar but not as plentiful as the Cheesecake Factory. At first glance nothing on the menu caught my eye. I became interested in a sandwich but they are only offered until 4PM. So I settled on the Avocado fried spring roll as a starter and the Shanghai Noodles with prawns as an entree. I also ordered a balleni on the recommendation of my friend.
Of course the bellinni came first. As mentioned I ordered this on the recommendation of my friend not knowing exactly what it was. Well it's a slushy drink with a few shots of different liquors and champagne. I hate slushy drinks and well it was very weak. Next came the Avocado fried spring rolls which are the same as UNOs version of the Avocado fried  egg rolls. (Yup the followed my across the boarder to Canada). They were yummy and enjoyable just like I remember Ehhh. Next and finally was the entree which was the Shanghai Noodles with prawns. It started well but then quickly went sour. They drowned the noodles in sauce which was very salty. So I only got to enjoy about 1/3 of the dish before it became soup. Yea I could of sent it back but I had already struggled to pick that dish and well I didn't love it enough to even bother. 

Service: Our waitress was very attentive and personable. The food and drinks came out in timely manner. We never felt rushed."}
{"text":"This Moxie's is in the Yorkdale Mall.  I've been here several times over the years as it is the go-to place that one of my friends and I go for dinner when I'm in Toronto.  The food is good, but it's our go-to place more because it's conveniently located for both of us and there's lots of free parking.  We always go on a weekday evening.  

Like all other Moxie's locations, female hostesses and servers wear really short skirts and/or really tight shirts with plunging necklines and it is my belief that they are hired more for their appearances than their abilities to work in the restaurant industry.  Usually they give us a male server (my friend is female.  I've noticed that when you're an all female group, they try to give you a male server, but if there is just 1 dude in your group, you'll get a female server...), but sometimes we do get a female server.  

Service is always fast and the servers are generally nice, but are often flaky and aren't too knowledgeable about the menu items.  

Anyway, the food is consistently good for a chain restaurant.  My favourite used to be the Citrus Chicken Salad which I would order almost every time, but they've removed it from their menu.  I've also tried the salmon (about $25), beef vindaloo (about $18) and the beef dip sandwich (about $15).  I also often get the \"bite of brownie\" for dessert (currently $3.75), which I've noticed has shrunk in size over the years but has gotten more expensive, but it's still good.  I've never been disappointed with the food here.   

It's not too well lit in the restaurant.  The decor is modern.  If you are claustrophobic you may want to avoid the washrooms.  The stalls are more like little rooms with really high doors (and no big gap at the bottom) - you really feel closed in.  In the women's washroom they have 2 sofa-like chairs with vanity mirrors attached so you can sit there and do your makeup (weird).

I feel that Moxie's (all locations) are geared towards a certain demographic which I can best describe as \"people who like to go clubbing.\"  I do not fit into this demographic, but I'm sure they are glad to accept my money nonetheless."}
{"text":"Moxies is my favourite restaurant, I go here every year for my birthday. This location is much better then square one as the one there is always crazy busy being located in the mall. Never have I been disappointed with any food I've ordered and the service is always great. I've tried quite a few things on the menu but I always crave the beef dip & soup; they're both soooooo yummy. For dessert, the white chocolate brownie is to die for the sticky toffee pudding is also really good as well. Love this restaurant!"}
{"text":"For the most part my experience here was typical. I've ate at Moxie's in Edmonton and I wasn't expecting anything fantastic. 

I was staying in Calgary for a conference and hadn't eaten much all day so by the time I got to Moxie's at the end of the night (around 8 pm) I was really hungry. I ordered a steak sandwich and a glass of water. 

My waitress seemed to disappear into thin air after I ordered. Which was bad, because she ran off without asking me how I wanted my steak. I didn't see her again until my meal arrived. I like my steak blue (but I'll accept anything up to medium rare), and the steak I received was well done. Ugh, ugh, ugh. I was so hungry I didn't send it back -- it took long enough to get it in the first place, and the waitress seemed to be in a really foul mood -- constantly scowling. 

I ate, paid, and left. $20 wasted!"}
{"text":"We had a pleasant experience here. good service and food tasted great. I am a little upset about the drinks which tasted a tad watered down or light on the alcohol. Would recommend for a lunch or casual dinner. I had ribs and salad and my wife had the kale salad with tofu. Both of our salads were also super light on the dressing."}
{"text":"I have never had to wait at a restaurant longer than I had to wait here. We didn't get a glass of water in the first 30 minutes of sitting down and there were barely any people in the restaurant. The food took over an hour to arrive and none of it was good. The margarita pizza is horrible with no tomato sauce and burned basil leaves. The service is absolutely horrible and no waiter or waitress ever comes around to check. Even though the atmosphere is good, the lack of service and terrible food just make this a horrible experience. Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Is it bad that I'm giving this place a 3 star thinking it should really be 2?

First off the food. We were 3 and we took some pasta, some fish taco and some enchiladas. The pasta was ok but nothing extraordinary. The enchilada and the taco were tasteless when they were hot. They actually tasted better cold. What a place that the food tastes better cold than hot.

So the food not great. How about the ambiance. This should be good right? At the beginning yes but quickly no. The music was at a ok level at the beginning. You could hear yourself talk. At one point though they brought it up so loud I thought I was in a club; not in a restaurant. And the crowd was not great. When you have to push people out of the way simply to get to the restroom it's not a great experience.
The one good thing that makes this a 3 star instead of a 2 is the service. The service was friendly and not pushy for us to leave when we were done eating."}
{"text":"My friends and I arrived around 7PM and we were first asked if we wanted to eat in the lounge (age restricted) or dining area- we chose the latter and waited around 10 minutes for an open spot. Our server was Christina and she was great. She gave us water without asking and her service was spot on!

I ordered the blackened chicken burger with a side of sweet potato fries. I have been to restaurants similar to Moxie's and their portion of fries were always small. However, the portion of fries I got at Moxie's was grande! I loved the environment, atmosphere, timing of food preparation, taste, and experience.

I would totally return!"}
{"text":"Came here at 8:30 with my friends and the seats were ready right away because we had a reservation on a Sunday night. I got the Frozé ($6.5 special) and the tuna poke in a jar (~$13). The drink had nice presentation but had a strong red wine after taste which I didn't really like. The tuna poke, I was expecting a small portion from photos, was indeed small and was not 2 servings as suggested. There was chopped tuna and avocado in a small mason jar, with nori crisps, and ponzu with ginger and spring onions. The tuna poke was very salty which really took away from the tuna and the ponzu was okay. For the price, it was not worth it.

Our servers were Heather and Stephanie and they were nice and accommodating for our large group.

Next time, I'll just stick to just sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"For me every dish I've ordered at moxie's has been DELICIOUS! My favourite is definitely the steak salad and any of their burgers! But I feel like the best of them all is the white chocolate brownie. I'm not a huge fan of sweets but this white chocolate brownie is soooo good, not too sweet to a point where it's sickening. Their drinks are another thing that keeps me going back, I'm a pretty light drinker so their mixed drinks are perfect for me. 

The only reason I am giving them a three star is because they are ridiculously slow at bringing out food... And on a few occasions have forgotten about my food. I had come in at about 10PM with a friend on a Thursday evening and was seated at the bar area. Drinks came quickly but our food was another story. Waited 45 minutes and finally asked our server about the food. She apologized and went to go check on it, 15 minutes later the manager came to us and told us that the kitchen had forgotten our order. He apologized and offered us drinks on the house. 10 minutes later our food came.  The service is AMAZING don't get me wrong, but this wasn't the only time they had forgotten about my food. On average it takes 30-45 minutes for my food to come. I'd say I'm pretty reasonable with time, if I see that the restaurant is obviously very busy I do not mind waiting 45 minutes for my food, HOWEVER, for the times where there weren't a lot of people, I think there was only once where I got my food before the 30 minute mark. So all in all, it's a pretty good place, but I usually only come for drinks now or drinks and a salad because those usually come out faster."}
{"text":"Its new, modern and its really good food. Not many people know about it, and getting in during suppertime is usually right on in. Last time I went during the supper rush the parking lot wasn't even full! 

We were able to mix and match what we wanted, and even got apps for full meals at apps prices. 

All in all fantastic."}
{"text":"Moxies is either a hit or miss restaurant. I was here with a group of 10 and we elected to sit in the lounge area.  This was on a Sunday with a long weekend on the Monday and it was not busy whatsoever. We sat down and ordered our drinks. They have $5 bellinis from Sunday - Thursdays and $6 double shots of Absolut after 9pm every single night which I think is a fantastic deal!

All of our food was great and everyone ordered a variety items such as burgers, pizza, pasta, soup, tacos, and wings.  I had the loaded backyard burger with fries and it was pretty good. Nothing special but it did the trick.

The main reason why Im giving three stars is due to our service or shall I say...lack of there of.  When I asked for a refill of my water she told us she was \"too busy with a big table\" and would come back to us....okay sure... too busy... I get it.  However she did not come back for awhile and we had to ask for our drink refills from another server.  You could also tell that the place was not ready for a big rush and it started to get a little busy but nothing a little teamwork and coordination could not handle."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for dinner and decided to sit on the patio since it was a beautiful day. The patio is spacious, modern and clean. I love the ambience of this restaurant, especially because every day they have daily drink specials. Once we were seated, we were greeted right away by a really sweet waitress named Emma. She let us know the daily drink specials and took our drink orders. She even recommended my friend the Moxies' style gin & tonic (which was delicious, might I add). After we got our drinks we ordered our food. I ordered the Salmon Banh Mi Sandwich with sweet potato fries as my side. The presentation of my food was nicely put together but I must say, I wasn't a fan of the sandwich. The texture of the salmon in the sandwich was not what I was expecting and tasted a little dry. I've never really been impressed with Moxies' food but for some reason I always come back. Other than that I only come back for the White Chocolate Brownie which is to die for! If it wasn't for that I'd probably only come back for the drinks and I'll remember to eat something beforehand. i don't recommend coming here for food because you will probably be disappointed."}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday night, the place was super busy as per usual. We had to wait for about 20-30 minutes until we got a table in the dining area.  We were seated in a booth seat closest to the washrooms and kitchen area.. didn't think anything of it at the time. I ordered a drink and we ordered the Bruschetta to share as a starter. The Bruschetta was delicious! They revamped it since I ordered it last and it came with a side of thinly sliced cheese and capers and crustinis.  The flavours go so well together!! I highly recommend this. Next, we ordered our Entrees and I decided to go with the Fish Tacos with a side of their housemade soup.  The boyfriend went with Beef Vindaloo. I'd have to say that my Fish Tacos were delicious!.. cheat day cause I got the fish fried, but none the less yummy. The housemade soup was a tomato based chicken and vegetable soup that was kind of on the saltier side. Definitely pass on this one.  As we're eating, there were a group of 4-5 people that stood behind us talking really loudly and standing so close to our booth that we couldn't even enjoy our food. They stood there for a good 15-20 minutes while another group of 3-4 people that were standing to the right of us taking turns to pay.  At this point it was impossible to have a conversation without having to yell on top of these groups of people.  On top of that, the waitress that we had disappeared on us for a good while.  We weren't asked if we were enjoying our food or if we needed anything.. we decided we'd try to wave down another waitress and asked to speak to a manager. 10 minutes go by and no one has came to our table.. no waitress, no manager.  Finally, after waiting and waiting forever, our waitress comes by and asks how we're doing and my boyfriend goes on to say how there were a bunch of people standing around us while we were eating and she simply said 'Ya, I told them to move but I guess they didn't listen.' She then asked for the manager. We told the manager what happened and he was very genuwine.  He explained the table we were sitting at does have a lot of traffic and isn't the most pleasant table to sit at.  He then continued to offer us dessert on the house.  We were too full to have dessert but I wish I would've cause the White Chocolate Brownie is the sh*t! Anyways, we decided we wouldn't have anything and he wrapped everything up for us, offered us a $20 gift certificate for our next visit at that location, and brought us the bill. Definitely got better customer service than we had at the beginning.  I'd say I'd definitely reconsider coming back to this particular location because it's so damn busy all the time and definitely avoid weekends!! Other than that, this place is just meh."}
{"text":"Went here with a group of colleagues and would never go again. We arrived at 7 pm but did not have food on the table until 8:30. My food arrived 20 mins after everyone else's (everyone else was basically done eating at that time) even though I had ordered the exact same thing as 2 other people. When it arrived, the salmon I ordered was barely cooked and still somewhat cold. I complained to the waitress about this but she didn't offer to recook it or give me anything else."}
{"text":"Not a great choice in my experience.... Ordered Asian chicken salad which arrived without the chicken. The second attempt arrived and no sesame seeds- these two items really are the only ingredients that give the dish taste. Not impressive."}
{"text":"Okay so I was in Toronto visiting a very very *special* friend and we decided to have lunch at Moxies one Sunday. We walked in and were seated right away. The hostess was really sweet didn't quite catch her name. Anyway, we chose a table that faced the window so we could people watch. Great Choice!! Our server was Claire...not only was she super sweet but she had AMAZING lashes (I know, that had nothing to do with the service but hey it was important to me!) Anyway, for starters we ordered the Three dip med bread...OMGEEEZUS!!! It was so freaking good. Fresh, tasty and the 3 dips were delicious!! I honestly could have ordered 3 servings of that, 2 glasses of wine and been happy!! But since I didn't seem like a bread eating lush I ordered the Pork sliders for my main course and the *special* friend ordered the Ranch house chicken burger. He ate every spankin' bit as did I with my sliders so needless to say everything was yummy. Although our waiter was a cutie I felt like she forgot about us sometimes...other then that the food was yummy and fresh, the restaurant was clean and I would surely go back!!"}
{"text":"Nice mid to upscale restaurant with unique dishes. Staff was very professional, and much nicer dressed than other Moxie locations. Great place for business lunches (while there with my company, looked like other business meetings happening as well)."}
{"text":"Sat near the washroom and kitchen in a dark deuce. I ordered a steak (med. rare) it came out more rare side bloody, super chewy, nearly impossible to cut. I felt like it was raw and looked cooked because of how dark it was and all this mushroom sauce crap on top of it. We had to ask for cutlery for apps and mains. At one point my partner dropped his fork and I just got up and toke a roll up from another booth as I was so frustrated. Food was sub-par , our server had several large parties in her section and we saw her doing multiple split bills for them so we Waited a while. 

Side note:They also don't have mashed potatoes with steak? One of my faves. Too bad it's close to my work. It's a pretty busy restaurant I'm assuming because of the cheap drink specials."}
{"text":"We came on Thursday night and the place was busy. It's more like a club in here than a restaurant. The music was super loud, you can barely hear the person next to you!

Service here is not very good. After being seated, took about 10-15 minutes before we were even greeted by the waitress. Our group ordered calamari (very good), potstickers (good) and wings (terrible - tiny and no flavour!) to start. The wings were really bad, deep fried and lightly breaded with absolutely no flavour! 

Kids meals are good deal here. Kids Cheeseburger is same as adult size except slightly less fries. Also includes drink and ice cream. I had the regular burger and literally it was identical to kids, with a few more toppings!

Our waitress never came back to check on us and it took another 10 minutes to flag someone to get us the bill. Food is what you expect for bar/restaurant chain but service definitely lacking."}
{"text":"I was here yesterday with a group for our gift exchange. I took off a couple stars because there are no reservations and the waiting area is quite small. We were told the wait would be 20 minutes but we ended up waiting for an hour. As more people came, the waiting area became very crowded and it was evident than a few of the  servers were getting annoyed that there was little room. Several of us waiting were given attitude and exasperated looks from three servers for \"blocking the way\" when we were just told to stay in that area by another server.

Just that experience alone created a bitter mood for everyone waiting.

Our server, (I can't remember her name) but she's blonde and has a nose ring, was absolutely amazing and definitely made up for it. She was funny, kind, and recommended great items on the menu and described all of our orders.

For appetizers some ordered calamari, bruschetta, and some sort of flat bread with a spinach and cheese dip. 

Half of the group got the new york steak holiday special with a side of mushrooms that was recommended. All of them enjoyed it very much and found the portion satisfying.
One person ordered the ribs, but I was told the steak was a far better option.

I ordered the starter salad and the citrus arugula salad (without meat or fish or dairy). They were pretty good! For me, a restaurant has great food if everything on the menu has had effort put into it. Other restaurants I've been to charge a ridiculous amount for a salad that really sucks. Moxie's arugula salad was different than anything I've tried before. It was warm and sweet, there was crunchiness from the asian noodles and I love that the tartness from the cherry tomatoes and the creaminess from the edamame and the figs or dates that was used.

For dessert my friends said that the chocolate cake is a must have. For myself, I had the blueberry tea that had such a nice presentation and ended off my meal nicely. 

Overall, the food is really good, and our server was amazing. I would give 4 stars for that alone. However, judging by our initial experience, the other servers are not at all like her which made all of us waiting feel extremely really awkward and close to walking out."}
{"text":"Good food. Bad service. Servers think they are Gods gift to earth when they are just the average hot  bartender nextdoor trying to make some change to support their broke lifestyle. Plus they try to hard to manipulate you for some tips lol"}
{"text":"I come to moxies quite often with friends or to enjoy some free range chicken after hitting the gym. Staff are friendly and professional.  Sometimes the girls try too hard to manipulate me by flirting for some tips by calling me hun, darling etc lol. However I enjoy it :) and love the new spot. Some times it gets too busy and service can be slow and some bartenders & staff can be rude at times."}
{"text":"Never in my life have i received the level of customer service that I got at Moxie's this afternoon. My coworker and I came for my birthday lunch, and although the food took a little while coming out because the restaurant was very busy, the manager Luke made up for it by covering our entire bill and giving us $25 cards for the inconvenience. Upon finding out I'm vegan, he also personally delivered a box of vegan cupcakes to my work since there wasn't any deserts I was able to eat on the menu. He is absolutely outstanding and definitely made our day. Thank you Luke!"}
{"text":"2.5 stars for the food. 4 stars for service ( 1 star deducted because our waiter messed up the bill).

Dined in the lounge tonight with a friend;  to catch up on the week's series of life events.
Ordered the $3 tacos, $5 dry ribs and $7 side table guacamole. We also got 2 orders of wings (half prices on Mondays).

I found the chicken wings and ribs REALLY REALLY DRY (1/5).  Comparable to jerky- dry. 
The fish and chicken tacos was soggy and the meat looked like unidentified objects. Chicken meat was from a can. (1/5)

They only thing I would order again is the guacamole (3/5). But then again, why come here for just guacamole?

I don't think I will be returning here again. Good for drinks though."}
{"text":"I almost did not eat here but am I glad I did! The food and the selection of different items on he menu was outstanding. Very friendly staff too! I had the red tai curry bowl and it was great! I will be in Calgary for another week and I guarantee i will be back here."}
{"text":"I brought a group of coworkers here on a summer Tuesday night - found it on OpenTable.  After climbing the two flights of steps,  we were greeted and seated at two hightop tables pushed together.  It wasn't very busy, but I can sense that this is a hot spot on weekends or hockey nights.

Our server, Sierra, was attentive and personable.  She offered up suggestions \"ooh - that's my favorite thing on the menu!\" and played with us \"do you want a kids' ice cream?\"  Overall, she was pleasant and a good server.  The manager stopped by during the meal to check on us.

Two people had the roast chicken; two people had the haddock; I had the salmon avocado salad, as did another coworker. One person had tuna salad and another had pasta tuscana(?) All the food was good and everyone finished it all - all of the dishes were very big enough to split.

The funnies thing was that I was ordering the salmon avocado salad because I was trying to be \"healthy\".  Somehow I missed the explanation on the menu that it is served with multiple STRIPS OF BACON on top.  No, not bacon crumbles - big long strips of bacon.  Honestly is it not necessary - the salad has great flavor without it.

 We also enjoyed multiple desserts.  They DO have \"just vanilla ice cream\" but it is a kids menu item.  For a treat, have your server prepare it the way they do for kids!"}
{"text":"Sometimes Yelp fails me.  No, not This restaurant - Moxie's was fine and \"Yay! I'm a fan.\"  But before I review it, let me tell you why I was an unhappy Yelper before finding Moxie's...

While in the area on business, I Yelp'd for the most-reviewed/best-rated place and we settled on an dim sum place nearby.  Upon entering the unnamed restaurant, we realized that we might be in over our heads.  As the only non-Asians, we were NOT \"warmly greeted\" and while we waited for someone to do so, I perused the menu slash checked out the stuff in the fish tanks.  We decided we were not up for this adventure. Maybe when we had someone to guide us....

Never-the-less, there are easily 12 other restaurants in proximity - one of every food genre.  To play it safe, we ended up at Moxie's based on my coworker's previous good experience at another location.

Basically, IMHO, Moxie's is a higher-end TGIFridays/Chili's/Applebees.  It is not as nice as The Keg, but I think the food at Moxie's is much better.  There are many signature items on their menu - we tried seared Tuna on a taro chips and it was both yummy and unique.

For dinner, I had the short-rib burger, which was probably 2000 calories with the cheese, sauteed onions, mayo on a buttered bun - but it WAS delicious.

Our server, Kirsten/Kristen?, was attentive and bubbly.  I feared this might be another \"breastaurant\" when we entered because most of the servers and hostesses are cute, young girls AND the place was loaded with guys eating.  BUT, there are some guys who work here and the girls really work hard together.  In a little while, there were tables of girls eating together and overall is was a good crowd for a Monday night in the YYZ'burbs.  We did not sit on the patio, but this was a mistake because everyone else who came in wanted to sit out there."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised considering I came in only due to a work farewell lunch (for yours truly), and was one of the only places that was within walking distance from the office. It is nice that they can accommodate pre orders and large reservations, such as our group of 14. Had a reservation for 12:00 on a Tuesday and when we arrived, and it was not that full. Somewhat expected for a bar and grill. I had the herb alfredo and added chicken, with the pasta being penne. I was half expecting long chicken strips and pasta, but actually they were actually bite sized pieces. The chicken was not overcooked and was tender. I wish the penne was a tad bigger but they were nice in the alfredo sauce which was nice and creamy. The cheese and onions gave additional flavours although I wish there were even more toppings available. 

At 19.99 (14.99 for the pasta and 5 for the chicken) it is comparable with most formal sit down restaurants. What set this apart for me was the nice atmosphere with tons of lighting and plenty of tvs around, and the quick service (e.g they put out 4 card machines for our group) . Good choice Matthew on the lunch spot....! It seemed my coworkers left feeling full and satisfied as well (FWIW the large majority of them ordered sandwiches)."}
{"text":"The concept of the restaurant/bar is unique. Had to take several stairs to get to the dining area. We only ate in restaurant, but bar seems very nice.

The service is very slow. I think the waitress was too busy flirting at the bar. Nonetheless, we had the bruschetta and the calamari to start. Both were very good. For our meals, we had the southern fried chicken sandwich, the asian chopped salad and the steak sandwich. All of the food was decent -- not as good as the appetizers. They have a HUGE menu, so there is definitely something for everyone."}
{"text":"From beginning to the end, our service was poor and very slow.
We came in on a Friday night around 1030pm and ordered drink specials that were recommended. I ordered a soup to start and pesto penne but instead of penne I wanted rigatoni. 

Sadly our server brought me a glass of water but did not ring in my gin and tonic and it took a really long time.  The service bar (guy) was nice enough to get me my drink asap, which in retrospect was probably the best service I received that night. 

My soup literally came a minute after we all received our drinks. Once I received my pasta, I realized that my penne was not changed to rigatoni and the pasta dish did not taste like pesto. The worst part of my dish were mushrooms. I thought they looked a little burnt but still decided to eat it and literally it felt and tasted like ash in my mouth. 

It took my server a long time to check up on us - to the point were one of my other friends were almost dome their own dish. At that point my friends were done with their meals and I didn't want to order anything else. My server apologized and took away my plate. The manager came around to ask what had happened to confirm my story (I guess?) and apologize. The thing about this place is that the servers don't really care if you're unhappy or happy. If a guest is unhappy, you as a server should do all in your power to make them happy when they are leaving. 

It took another ten minutes which I timed for her to come around again just for us to ask for the bill and another 7 and a half minutes to bring the bill out. To me, that is unacceptable service. So I am happy to say I am never going to a Moxies, ever. Over priced food and girls who think they can get away with slow and poor service because they look good. 

Where's a place where there are pretty girls that have common sense and a brain?"}
{"text":"My favorite Moxies restaurant. Every time I come to this restaurant the food the drinks are always perfect. My friends and I went couple of weeks ago for dinner. And fell in love with the food all over again. I had the Mango Chicken with a side of veggies and a Real Peach Bellini. The mango chicken was amazing, it was something different but it's something you should give it a try. There Bellinis's are always right on. As of for dessert we had the most talked about dessert, the white chocolate brownie. If you ever get a chance to check the restaurant out, make sure the brownie is on your list of foods to try!"}
{"text":"The food is ok. Got the rustic Italian pizza for $17.75. Reasonable price since it's medium sized and shareable. The desserts are obviously the thing here - the infamous white chocolate brownie. It's pretty big and so addicting. You can't just have one bite. I think it has some drugs in it because after eating it, I felt really woozy and sleepy like I was drugged. Be careful. ..tip for girls: not the best to order on a first date.

Service is okay. Our server was Spanish apparently....but she can't speak Spanish at all. I think she's just trying to be friendly but she was extremely busy for the most part and couldn't provide an A plus service. I'm sure she does her best but the delivery is pretty slow.

Overall it's a typical restaurant with okay food. It's busy ...I don't really know why. Most of the food here are basic and lack flavour."}
{"text":"I have no idea what intrigued me to come here all the time during my years in highschool, maybe the food was better back then or my tastebuds were somehow damaged or under developed. After a 5 year hiatus, I decided to go back to my teen favourite restaurant, moxies, specifically this location because I've been so many time over the years for birthday parties. Wanted to keep it traditional and order the foods I had been accustomed to at moxies. Starter was the famous \"med bread\" short for Mediterranean, the bread was completely doused in spices to where it was overwhelming, it took me a good 30 minutes to get the taste of thyme out of my mouth, for those who don't know, thyme, by itself, in large amounts, is not such a pleasant spice. My main was the chicken tenders, again keeping it nostalgic. The now thick BREADED chicken tenders tasted like the ones you get from the frozen section in the grocery store, I know for a FACT they used to be flour dusted, very small layer of breading that was crunchy and aesthetically pleasing to look at. No idea what made them change their methods but it's seriously damaged them. To sum my rant up, they are awful now, same as the fries, zero effort whatsoever. My girlfriend got the chicken penne , pasta was over cooked, chicken was rubbery and had an awful after taste, sauce, sorry what sauce, the dish was dry. It's sad that I'll never be going to this restaurant ever again. Moxies food quality has seriously gone down hill. 2 stars because the staff was friendly and my beer was cold. Or else you would have gotten one. Farewell my old friend."}
{"text":"I just had the best meal here so I am changing my review.  I had the Spanish Roasted Chicken and added the Alex Chen experience salad and dessert.  The salad was fantastic with Arugula, beets, oranges, leeks, and fennel (i think). The chicken was served with cous cous and dessert I got was the Panna Cotta which was wonderful just as good as Bacco Rest. in Noe Vally, San Francisco!  My server was also great (Shawn).. very attentive and always kept our drinks filled."}
{"text":"Fair to middling bar/resto.  I ordered the haddock which was seared and sitting atop spinach and mashed potatoes.  I enjoyed the food however became very ill a few hours after I ate.  I suspect it may have been the mashed potatoes.  Decor of this place is very nice--dimly lit, creative wine bottle display and your standard flat panel tv's.  Our server Brad was EXCELLENT very patient and helpful.  It gets packed quickly after 5pm but when I left around 8:30 I could see several empty tables.  Street signage could be better."}
{"text":"Moxie's is one of the better places to have dinner, check out the eye candy and have a beer or a mixed drink without getting ripped off. This is one of the better franchises here in Canada. The bar tender was excellent. None of this \" I can't pour you a drink\" crap. I asked for a White Russian and I go that a stiff well poured drink without that Toronto attitude. I had a pizza with Asparagus and goat cheese. This combination was exceptional. A few drinks later, some engaging conversation with the bar tender and a few of the beautiful waitresses and I feel the value was way above average. Great place to get some dinner with your bud or girlfriend."}
{"text":"Don't even get me started on these incompitant waitresses. If I want to see women in short skirts, then I will go to the clubs downtown. If I want competent service, then I will go anywhere else but here."}
{"text":"I'm a newly diagnosed celiac, and I also am allergic to corn and crustaceans so I'm a bit of a difficult customer, but they were so pleasant and had a gluten sensitive menu which they brought out for me. I talked to the manager and the chef who were concerned and wanted to make sure I would have something yummy yet not harmful to my stomach. I had the portobello mushroom burger on a gluten free bun with a side of house salad, which was to die for! The gluten free bun stayed together and had a fluffy texture. I even ended up asking the waitress where the buns came from and she was more than happy to give me the company information :) I didn't feel like a burden, which was new to me when eating out at a restaurant. Super impressed and I will be returning for sure!"}
{"text":"Considering it was a Saturday night I was able to walk-in and get a table for me and 3 other buddies.

The fries that we got were a little soft and not crunchy. The service was slow and the waitress took forever to get our order and our bill.

The only think that was good is that the staff were really nice and always smiling and they have great deals on their drinks for Saturday"}
{"text":"Moxie's has only one trump card among the plethora of other restaurants at STC: it's inside the mall. When you don't feel like trekking through rain and snow to Milestones, Jack Astor's, and/or Scaddabush, Moxie's is the next best option. By no means is it the higher quality option. It is the go-to for the average lazy diner who wants something of a higher pedigree than food court fare. 

Atmosphere-wise, it earns a fair mark. The dim lighting and conservative black-grey furniture provide a reasonably cleaner, upper middle-class setting. In addition, the servers are always friendly and open to conversation, so they bring good vibes to the table. 

The food though is where it lacks luster.  The prices are on the higher end of the spectrum, yet the flavour, portion-size, texture, and variety are just average. There is no wow factor and nothing to write home about. With such an unbalanced price to quality ratio, I can't say I ever crave for Moxie's. As aforementioned, you would probably find yourself heading to other nearby restaurants during good weather, leaving Moxie's for those dreary days when food quality is not the top priority."}
{"text":"While in Canada for the week I decided  to go here for lunch since it's near my hotel. My fiancé and I sat down in the lounge area to watch the basketball game mean while the food was ordered. 
We were greeted by the waitress Yanesk who was very nice and brought us some water while we looked over the menu. 
I ordered the calamari for an appetizer and man was this delicious. I ate it all with the sweet chili sauce they bring it with I wasn't a fan of the sriracha aioli. The mix of calamari and shrimp with the sauce was perfect. My fiancé ordered a straight consumel margarita which I ended up drinking half of because it was refreshing. 
For our entrees we ordered the chipotle mango chicken which comes with a sweet and Smokey dry rub, lemon quinoa, seasonal vegetables, fresh avocado and salsa Fresca on top of the chicken. The other main were the chicken enchiladas served with sour cream, guacamole , and salsa with a few corn tortillas chips. This place was actually really good and I would love if they had one back home. Expand to Miami, FL guys it would make a great place to eat often."}
{"text":"Appetizer - Had the calamari with the most delicious sauces! Couldn't get enough of those shaved one was sweet Thai like and the other was cheesy! I would have appreciated if they give more fresh or slightly cooked jalepenos instead of over cooked dry ones. 

Main Course - Mustard and Dill Salmon was okay. The salmon melted in my mouth. Felt like my potatoes could use some more sauce.  Want absolutely nuts about this meal hence the three stars. 

Dessert - White Chocolate Brownie was a LARGE portion size and I would recommend you share this. It was delicious and warm if you've got a sweet tooth! 

The waitress was knowledgeable and accommodating.

Korean Fried Cauliflower 
This was a saucy (sweet with a hint to spice) appetizer - an imitation of chicken wings. Not amazing but it was okay. 

The sauce that came with it looks like an Indian chutney by was more yogurt than anything."}
{"text":"A very good place to sit down and enjoy a meal I enjoyed the atmosphere very upbeat, the steak that I ordered was perfectly cooked and the mushrooms were incredible.
I have to say they had a very poor beer selection I asked for the darkest beer on tap they had and they brought me something...? that I could see through... very disappointing from being in the states with all the craft beers now available.
10 years ago Canada was Beer central, now I think their political system has ruined the Beer industry here."}
{"text":"Worst Moxie's location!!! Waitress was slow in our order and when we spoke to the manager they did nothing about it. I ordered a bottle of wine for a celebration which NEVER came. Who waits til the entree in finished to remember the wine. Even escalating to head office is useless. They take their time with responses. Worst of the worst Moxie locations!!!"}
{"text":"Rather disappointing.  My peppercorn New York was thin and tough. I ordered medium rare and got medium. My wife ordered a medium rare sirloin and it was very rare. We were left waiting over 10 minutes for out wine to arrive while our meals sat and got cold. At $150.00 for dinner for two I think I'll stick to The Keg or Baton Rouge. Much better, reliable and consistent. I won't return here."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a couple drinks and something to eat before a Jay's game. Quiet spot at first then got quite busy as the after work crowd moved in. Nice room, lots of TVs.
Waitress was attractive, pleasant and efficient. 
We had fish tacos, sushi cones and guacamole for apps. No complaints on these items, just nothing terribly special about them. 
Was not thrilled with some Thai dish I ordered. Serves me right I suppose. Should have stuck with a burger or a sandwich."}
{"text":"Lovely decor and space, as well as a fireplace! That's about all the positive that I can say about this moxies. The waitress took forever to get water and then scurried off before we could order. We were the only ones sitting in the lounge at the time, it wasn't an issue of business. We didn't get a chance to order for quite a while after that, and once we'd ordered it was another half hour. I ordered a simple burger, the fries that came with it were completely cold, the burger itself was gross. It's pretty difficult to mess up a burger, but somehow it was managed. My partners food was also cold and sub-par. The waitress never came back to check on us and after waiting quite a while with the dirty dishes in front of us, we went to find someone to give us the bill."}
{"text":"I loveeeeeeeee moxies. The food is great, classy and although the wait can be lengthy on the weekends the staff is extremely polite and accommodating."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! Told that I would have a table in a 1/2 hour, then was told they didn't know how long it was going to take! I had a baby with me my 8 year old, wife and my father in law and mother in law as well! We left upset because we were lied too! Will not be coming here again!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere and food was great! 

I had there street tacos fries and a beer.

The soft shells where not store bought, big plus.  The chicken was flavorful and the fries tasted great"}
{"text":"Some of the reviews weren't great but we decided to give it a try regardless.
Glad we did !
Food and service were great.  Nicely designed restaurant."}
{"text":"Had a great meal there, and they were very welcoming even though I was with a baby! Desserts and soups recommended"}
{"text":"Best steaks for the price: Nicely seasoned. Thick cut and cooked properly on a real grill. Way above any other chains or steakhouses. I believe the steaks are 4 weeks dry aged and wet season aged after.

Pastas are bomb: Try the Rigatoni with Madeira Sauce. Out of this world. Alfredos cant be beat. 

Sides are on point: The fries, roasted veg, sweet potates, stuffed potatoes, even the salads and grains such as rice/quinoa/wild rice are perfectly made.

Burgers are the best ones yet: Fresh juicy but grease free burgers with amazing crisp taste.

Apps are killer: Calamari and spicy tuna rolls are explosions in your mouth. Try the pokey as well. Nachos are loaded. There is biriyani flav for wings too ;)

Salads are sexy: Amazing chef cut salads such as salmon and tuna salads with delicious hot and cold dressings!

Good seafood/ fish items: Try the salmon or the fish tacos! I was once addicted to the salmon with rice and veg and lemon juice all over!

NOW THE DESSERTS!: Hands down the best desserts in any restaurants! White choc brownie! Oh man! Cheese cake oh man! Sticky toffee dear Lord! And then dark choc cake for those chocolate lovers! All desserts are made with real ingredients. Not sugar and color to make it look like something.

And last but not the least: The drinks are great! Amazing selection of wines all the way to vintages and European classics. Good cocktails and beers on tap!

Check this place out for anything! Diverse menu with food and drinks from all over the world while maintaining newest trends and classics alike!"}
{"text":"Seeing as the first 2 reviews were rather negative, maybe a change in perspective is in order here.

There are only a handful of restaurants in Scarborough that are good for hangouts.  Moxies is one of them.  In terms of pricing, I don't find that they are any different than Milestones or Jack Astors.  I agree that for what you get, considering it isn't gourmet or chef-worthy food is a bit overpriced, but what are the other options in Scarborough available for a better ambience and the \"upscale feel?\"  I challenge anyone to name a restaurant.  

So unfortunately, restaurants like Moxies and Milestones will continue charging what they charge until we have more options in our demographic area.  If you think Moxie's is bad, you should try the Baton Rouge across the street.  

I love the Bellinis at Moxie's, and my all-time favourite is their White-Chocolate Brownie.  Hands down, THE best dessert from a chain restaurant I have ever had.  It is definitely one thing worth getting fat for.  Their sweet potato fries are also something I order frequently. I also love their Mosaic Dip as an appetizer.  But get it to share, because it's very filling.  Their stuffed baked potato is one of the most amazing sides ever!  I would steer clear of their salads as they are overpriced and usually leave you wanting more... 

The servers are \"Hooters\"-esque so I agree with Dave's comments about not bringing dates here, although... if you have a wandering eye, the date probably won't end with a goodnight kiss anyways, lol."}
{"text":"Good food, terrible service. You never tell your customers that you are busy and can't take care if your order. By the time we received our food, it was almost an hour later. Our server was only attentive at the beginning of our dining experience and at the end. We were lucky enough to have two other server bring our food and drinks. 

I generally like Moxies but wouldnt recommend coming to this location unless you come during non peak hours."}
{"text":"I have been to it several times and they had the greatest service every time. Great atmosphere, decent food as well. Ordered fish taco and pizza the last time I visited, the pizza was a little overcooked but fish taco was great. The manager suggested white chocolate brownie for dessert and it was excellent! Big portion and enough for three people."}
{"text":"Thumbs up from the USA! Moxie's makes me want to move to Canada. Good food, well presented, in a stylish decor, by an attentive staff. And...a hostess and bar staff that rates as the best eye candy I've seen in the Great White North. Nice job, Moxie's. My business colleagues agree."}
{"text":"Not much to say, I'm not really a chain restaurant person, but Steph S. and I wanted to grab a bite before going out on the weekend. We had originally tried Earl's in Dalhousie, but that wasn't going to be happening, so we headed this way. 

It was also super busy, but we managed to snag a couple seats at the bar. The service was terrible, mostly because you have bartenders, taking food orders and playing both roles. 

I ordered the pork tacos, as they come in a corn tortilla so I was able. The server was good enough to ensure there was nothing added that could make me sick. They told me the can't prevent cross contamination, but the tacos themselves were ok. 

We had the gin & tonic, and peach soda for drinks. Steph went a burger. The food was decent and drinks were yummy. It's always an option for a good quick meal."}
{"text":"Another Moxie's review. This one was a little better than last time. I met up with a gf of mine, and we chose this location as we live on opposite sides of the city. I have never gone to this location before, but it was a good choice. We got there at lunch time on a Friday, but we were seated right away. 

Had a very pleasent server, I ordered the tandori salmon salad without naan bread and my friend had the curry rice bowl. Both of our meals were delicious, and we over all had a good time. 

If you are in that area, and want a good meal, it's worth checking out for sure."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of Moxie's. Why? I'm not a fan of any restaurant that serves food and has low to no lighting. I feel like the darkness is that I don't see how bad the food is. Thankfully for Moxie's, I don't need to see it; I can just taste how bad it is. I've ordered their nachos and they were bland. I ordered a pasta dish and it was average. I've had dessert and even though the white chocolate brownie was okay, I've tasted better elsewhere. I've tried various items and just realized that aside from drinks, they will never be my first pick for going out to eat. There is only ONE item on the menu I like and that is the avocado spring rolls. So much so that the last time I went there, I asked for 2 orders of it as my main.

This one in particular is annoying because it's one of 2 restaurants in Yorkdale that is underground, so no to little cell service. It's hard to tell a person to meet you there and then get a table while you wait.

Sadly, certain friends of mine always seem to want to go here. That's fine--as long as they know that we'll all have to meet beforehand and walk over and that I will ALWAYS eat spring rolls when we go."}
{"text":"I had a really bad experience at this Moxie's. I went there for a friend's birthday party and there were over 30 of us. At first we thought it was very nice of them to give us the whole atrium for the party. As dinner time get closer, and everyone was trying to sit down in a big group, we noticed that we cannot rearrange the tables as they were bolted to the floor. Most of us have to sit in tables of four and even two, which was very pointless. In addition, there were no distinct servers assign to us. So when we needed to order or request something, we were running around in the restaurnat like a headless chicken trying to look for a server. Needless to say, the servers were not friendly and not attentive at all. The food was terrible and the portions were small. I ordered a medium rare steak and they gave me a medium well (closer to well done) steak. It was dry and rock hard. I really hope the owner of this place knows what's going on in the restaurant. I would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"For dinner, I ordered the fish tacos which came with a fairly small salad.  They tasted fine but there was more filler (corn salsa, avocado, sour cream) than fish.  I appreciate the serving sizes not being ridiculously large - nobody should eat that much.  It would have been nice if the server asked if we wanted lemon for our water or lime for our beer.  When I made those requests, he brought one slice of each for me but none for my friends.

The women's washroom was nice and clean but the lights were only on in the area near the sinks and not in the stalls.  I couldn't find a light switch.  Very odd!

The service was alright, the decor was upscale and there's lots of parking."}
{"text":"Service is good. Eye candies plentiful. A tad on the loud side (with the music and chatter going on). The food is as expected. Nothing to write home about. Better than the food court and not quite in the calibre of others. All in all, for a quick simple meal, this place does the trick; especially, when the location is convenient."}
{"text":"Not very busy, but with not enough staff we had a bit of a wait and the food came out cold. Both were tasty, but chicken fingers and beef dips should be hot. Server was nice and apologetic. Sorry, just not enough that to bring us back."}
{"text":"Came here for a coworkers lunch and got the ahi tuna salad. Presentation was very nice and I liked the sauce but it wasn't worth $27 :( the tuna was pretty good but I don't think the cabbage/cilantro went that well with the tuna. Anyways service was okay, and the interior was nice."}
{"text":"Worst Moxies in Calgary don't waste your time coming here. We came here just after exams to enjoy our freedom but were so disappointed. Our server was really rude and every time we asked a question she would have this annoyed face like she really didn't want to serve us. Wish I got her name.. But anyways on to the actual worst part of our experience...

My three friends and I entered this Moxies and were told to sit down and wait as they would text us when a table was free. However it wasn't that busy at all with manyyyy empty tables. So after 10-15 mins we got a \"text\" saying to come to the front which was literally 10 steps away (odd..). Anyways so our server came and took us to our table and this is when her face changed to extremely annoyed and she gave us our menus and left. We waited for about 10 mins for her to come back and take our drinks order and we told her at this time that we would be ordering 4 appetizers to share and one girl was getting a meal..plus lots of drinks. She never said anything and left. Another 10 mins later she brings our drinks and we tell her our order and she leaves. Another 10 mins later she comes and says they have none of the appetizers available?..I don't really get it why they wouldn't. 

Anyways so we quickly picked whatever was available and told her to hurry as it had already been 30 mins. Another 10 mins later she brings out appetizers and sits them in front of us. She doesn't bring any plates and cutlery as she claimed they don't have any clean ones available and would give us new ones as soon as they are..she never did. So not to make our food cold we started eating with our hands. When we asked for napkins she said they don't have any.. Like srsly wtf? 

Anyways So I went to the bathroom and got some paper towel that we could use and when she saw those she made such a angry face as if we did the worst thing ever. After giving our drink refills she did not return once even when we wanted to pay. I had to go to the front to ask for the receipt and pay. Our server was no where in sight..

I should've called the manager but none of us had it in us to make such a scene so we left it. I will never go back..such a bad experience."}
{"text":"Went with a large office group yesterday for lunch. First being a vegetarian, there are hardly any choices available. Moxies calls itself ultimate \"premium\" casual dining experience.

My experience was no where close. I contemplated ordering a past dish that my colleague next to me ordered but minus the meat. But went with the only vegetarian meal on the menus that I could see - a Veggie Burger and fries. Another colleague also ordered the same dish but without the goat cheese that comes with it. The servers mixed up our order and I knew they mixed up but was not in a mood to send it back, because the other colleague had already started the meal.

Now the quality of the burger - I expected the burger to be premium - but it was not even close. I have had veggie burgers just about everywhere Licks, Hero, Harveys, Burger King, etc. Trust me the the burgers at Harveys beats Moxies hands down. For $14+ for a burger and fries, in my opinion was a waste.

The restaurant was busy but not packed. The refill on my drink came in at least 15 minutes after requesting it. BTW, there was a mandatory 18% gratuity included in the bill!

And I am glad that I did not order the pasta dish - in my colleagues opinion it wasn't good and yes they err'ed her order as well.

Had Nachos as an appetizer as well and quantity was just not good enough even for two! And the nachos were served with a dip on the side - Not my idea of a good nachos"}
{"text":"Great service. Classy atmosphere. Great for dates. Steaks are delicious, but I get mine blue rare with madagascar peppercorn sauce (: I love the sweet potatoes fries. One of my favourite restaurants because they're common. The white chocolate Brownies are to die for! If you can't finish one, there's always the bite sized."}
{"text":"5 stars for 3 reasons - friendly staff, don't screw up my food and finally - they give out EMS, fire and police discount."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice in the last few weeks, once with a business associate in the restaurant and once by myself at the bar and I really enjoyed the dinner, the service and the atmosphere. I'd actually give this place a 4.5 stars, but not 5. In my book to get 5 you need to be over the top good and they're not that good. 

Their Wednesday and Tuesday night wine specials are great! I had some apps while in the bar, lettuce wraps and potstickers which were really good. Service in both the bar and the dining area was excellent as well. Very friendly and knowledgeable wait staff and bartenders. 

The atmosphere is fun, kinda loud but not so much that you can't hear someone you're with. 

I'm going back to the area in January and will definitely stop in again."}
{"text":"As far as the chain restaurants of this sort are concerned, I put this one near the bottom.  Great atmosphere and generally friendly staff, but very underwhelming food.

Today I had the Thai curry chicken bowl. A mix mash of about a dozen vegetables, zero heat, and served with overdone rice and a roti that was not spiced right.  The dish should not be referred to as Thai."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time and money here. A group of us had dinner on a Monday evening and ordered your typical fare. Every single item came out overly salted. The service was slow and unattentive. It took extra energy to convince ourselves to leave a tip but in the end we did as we always do."}
{"text":"I enjoyed going ton Moxie's in Ontario and Alberta so was excited when they opened a location in Montreal. The place is well located with great decor!!! That being said I kind of felt disappointed with the meal after going twice I thought it wasn't up to par with the other locations in terms of quality and presentation."}
{"text":"Mediocre food

Can't seem to find a fav dish on the menu

Liked the tuna wonton crisp appetizer until they removed it :-("}
{"text":"Weekly lunch with my team! Visited moxies for lunch. Table for 8 in back corner! Great ambiance, a wee bit hot for patio but inside is very comfortable. Got the backyard burger which was great! Very juicy and packed burger with a generous amount of sautéed mushrooms! Served with a side of fries. 

There is one lunch option on the menu! Moxies is great for dinner but no real options for a quick lunch or a sandwich and drink combo; which would make me revisit the restaurant at dinner time as they seem to cater better to this crowd.

Hopefully someone from moxies reads this and monopolizes on the ability to get a lunch menu as there is lots of competition nearby that carter well to tables of 5+ at lunch! After all, who is buying a steak for $34 at lunch? Common! 

Totally side track about reviewing the food but it was delicious and everyone enjoyed their choices! The server was very attentive too!!"}
{"text":"The food there is somewhat average, my mango chicken was pan seared Cajun chicken with some mango purée splashed on the plate. But it tasted good I never touched the mango sauce didn't seem right to mix it with the chicken. The appetizers tempura shrimp and calamari was good. What was the best that I tried was the shrimp lobster linguine, note if you don't like vinegar or capers warn them that either put less or none in there. Drink prices and the way the place is set up and full house is probably why I would go again"}
{"text":"So bad.
Started off well in that the server was friendly - I typically engage servers with friendly banter. This time about Trump - Yikes. She seemed cheerful enough and mentioned the 5 dollar special drink.  She said she wasn't sure on the price but was pretty sure it was 5 dollars and would check. I ordered one. 
We ordered - for me Lettuce wraps for my hubby the chinese chicken salad. 
The food arrived later. 
The lettuce wraps were ok - but the sauce - oh dear god - what was in that horrific sauce - it tasted like someone had pulverized leather, mixed it with mayonnaise and cilantro and butter. It was horrible. I asked if they had anything else. She brought over essentially soy sauce with sesame seeds in it - it was ok - anything but that sauce - which quite frankly ranks as one of the worst things i heve ever eaten. 
The chinese chicken salad was apparently SO BLAND. Lacking any flavour - was it even dressed, my hubby asked for some of the soy sauce too. 
Here is where it gets interesting. 
When the bill arrives - the 5 dollar drink was $7.50 and we were charged for the sauces.  The sauce that was needed as a replacement for the horrible sauce for the lettuce wraps and to add flavour to the salad. 
Whatever happened to ( in the case of the sauces) making it right? Fixing the problem. 
The drink - bait and switch. Dont sell it as a special and then charge more for it. 
When I brought this to the servers attention. She said I only charged you for one sauce - I said   \" You shouldnt charge us for any of them\". She didnt like that. 
She took the extra charges off the bill with the manager and when she returned she was miserable.  I went to speak to her and make small talk and she said nothing back. 
Her personality did a 180. How miserable. 
I would never ever return to this location."}
{"text":"Great Restaurant, I go to this location often. The lettuce wraps are AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"Nice place for a business lunch. Server was great, and my mango chicken was pretty good. Would have given it 4 stars but someone at the table had Asian salad and said it  wasn't good, and my Old Fashioned was horrible."}
{"text":"Came in and had the most amazing service from Rosa.  She was nothing but exceptional.  She gave me amazing recommendations and she was fantastic overall.  

My bf is a manager at the Soho and he wants to hire her.  This is how amazing she was.  Friendly, knowledgeable and was superb.  Food was great and was cooked how I wanted it."}
{"text":"Going to a chain restaurant is something I do when I just can't decide or I don't want a long drive into the 416. Moxies is a place that offers a modern vibe, with a fairly diverse menu to please most people. 
This evening was the \"let's go somewhere close\" excuse as we dined here at the Woodbridge location. 
We ordered the calamari app to share, and three different salads as mains since we were all feeling the urge to try and be healthy, albeit I did order a beer while my two friends ordered water! 
The calamari came with shrimp and fires jalapeños and two dips, the flavour was good but for $14 the portion size was rather disappointing, maybe they realized we were trying to be healthy and cut back on the portion to help us. 
My salad was the asian blend and was enough to satisfy my hunger, the other two were well portioned and again all tasted great. Now I know some are probably reading this and saying the salads aren't always healthy, and they would be right! Moxies does provide the calorie count alongside each dish and yes I believe my salad was about 1000 calories. So for those dieters, this info will aid you in picking the appropriate dish. 
The service was okay, it could have be a little bit more attentive and more lively. I notch that up to the server probably being less experienced.
Overall an okay experience for a place I don't really go to for dinner, just drink specials and apps. See you again at patio season."}
{"text":"Good food, good atmosphere, light on draft choices but the choices they have are good. Recommend if you're in the area"}
{"text":"We stopped in for a quick lunch after a business meeting nearby and had a nice experience. 
 The staff was friendly, the atmosphere was lively and the food was surprisingly good considering it is located in a mall.  I enjoyed the chicken enchiladas with chips and salsa...I know, why would someone from Phoenix order Mexican food in Canada?!?  It certainly wasn't authentic, but was a good comfort food lunch before heading to the airport to head home."}
{"text":"I tried Moxie's for the first time since moving to Calgary from Montreal.
Comparing to Montreal is unwise, however I had a good experience contrary to the reviews.

The place has a nice ambiance, space for families and a separate bar (kinda Sports Bar), the menu has a good number of options. I'm a fan of steaks and judge places based on their Steaks, 8 oz was a little less for me though it was cooked perfectly medium.

I enjoyed the cheesecake dessert, it's as good as you would get anywhere.

I would recommend the place for a casual dinner.. anytime!"}
{"text":"Moxies has a gluten free/gluten intolerant menu. The waitress, staff, and cooks know what they are doing and are very knowledgeable of their processes. Their is even a gluten free cheesecake if you are also not allergic to nuts. If you ask to sit in Ember's section if she is working she is a breath of fresh air in the Montreal city."}
{"text":"I definitely have a great time at this location every time. I also chose to celebrate my birthday here, which speaks volumes over the quality of product, atmosphere, and of course service. I most recently came here with two friends tonight after work and was seated outside, it was a lovely evening. Our server was friendly and prompt and everything was perfect. I personally ordered the lettuce wrapped burger, my friend the calamari and my partner the fish tacos. We all enjoyed our meals. I've never tried the lettuce burger before but I really enjoyed it - it was the perfect amount of food without leaving me feeling stuffed. Albeit it was a bit complicated to figure out the best way to eat it but it tastes great and I feel satisfied but not stuffed. Honestly nothing bad to say about this location, it's always a great time here and I never think twice about going. They also frequently have specials on food and drinks which is definitely a great reason to go. Will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"It's interesting handing moxies a four star rating, given that most of my visits to any moxies chain have either been disastrous or a regretful decision for the fact that I could've been somewhere else better.

With a recent visit to this southport location, I expected subpar food but was surprised to find that the food was appetizing. We had the avocado spring rolls, surf/turf steak, and the crab scallop egg benedict. 

The service we received was average but it seemed the waitress was preoccupied with her other duties and didn't do as much hovering. We didn't waste time waiting around and often waived to get her attention to get what we wanted. Our food did take a while but the hostess/manager instantly took notice without us mentioning it.  It turned out that the eggs benedict were botched and the kitchen had to make another one, so she instantly gave us a discount off our meal.

I'll definitely keep this place in mind in the south area in case I ever need to eat somewhere that doesn't require much deliberation"}
{"text":"If there's one place in north York I love going to, it's moxies at Fairview mall, mainly because of the absolute best bartender, mikey! His comical personality keeps us coming back with his \"punny\" jokes! He's a keeper, as long as he's pouring drinks, we'll be at the bar!"}
{"text":"I'm astounded that I could have been even more disappointed than last time.

I was contacted by the general manager following my review to try to remediate the situation with me and he proceeded to snail mail me a print out of a coupon to encourage me to come for another visit. This mail took over 4 weeks to mail when I could have easily printed it out myself. Just saying.

Anyways. Today is my anniversary and we decided it would be a good opportunity to make use of the coupon I finally received (valid only at this location). We made sure to check online and it said they were open until midnight on Mondays according to Google, so we were like okay great, let's go! As we finally arrive at 10:45, we stood around for several minutes before being greeted and then we were met with some wonderful news.

\"Sorry guys, last call was a few minutes ago.\"

I was furious. I don't even want to bother with that stupid coupon. We went out of our way on our anniversary and were very hungry and we were met with that idiocy. I'm absolutely astounded that this place is still in business and will not be back. We left extremely pissed off an hungry.

That's strike two. There will be no strike three. I'm Russian, and we don't play baseball."}
{"text":"When you have a group of talkative chatty people who live to eat and love to talk about their journeys and stories keep getting swapped with tales of grandeur, shopping escapades in Hong Kong and a birthday thrown in.  Well!  The only place to do it near the Airport is at Moxies.  

Typical food items for groups of four or more are best order under the shared items from the menu.  Nachos, calamari, bruschetta' s. Etc.  
Rounds of wine and beer to drink and for the designated drivers; pop, tea, sodas ,  coffee and virgin drinks.  If you're dating and not diabetic then go for a Shirley Temple.  The perfect happy drink. 

Best of all was our server from BC.  Tall and very pretty.  She was perfect.  Got the orders right and kept coming back to assist our requests. 

Salt and pepper wings are so so at 2.5 stars and the salad which was supposed to be dressing on the side was drenched in dressing.  Other than that it was all good.  I'm giving 4 stars for the ambiance and fun vibe it gave for us.

The food could do better but it's kinda what I expect. 

If your middle aged and hip with money to spend.  You'll have a great time."}
{"text":"Service was food, food overpriced for quality served.

Had dinner and ordered steak. Side was steamed broccoli and had a baked potato.

Service was attentive, prompt and friendly. But, for a small 7 oz steak, half raw (half crunchy, half soft) pale-looking broccoli, and what looked like a pre-made potato, it was way overpriced.

Come for the atmosphere and service, get a steak somewhere else."}
{"text":"1/2 priced glasses of wine on Tuesdays ....cool vibe and atmosphere....great bartenders. Totally recommend it!!  I had the blackened chicken sandwich with a house salad with peppercorn ranch. Amazing!!!  Definitely recommend, as well."}
{"text":"Restaurant chains have standardized food. They abandoned the home made food principle, and became a corporation which goal is to absorb as much market targets as they can.

I am not into attending this kind of want to be trendy-social-gathering restaurant enterprises. However, this Friday we were on the area, we were hungry, and this place had the most stars on yelp.

We went, I enjoyed the time spent in there, and the food was ok.

The service and installations were optimal for every occasion. They divided the spaces so good, that when moving towards the washroom you feel you are passing inside a wooden hedge maze. 

They have deals on drinks; soup/salad with sandwiches; vast menu of food, and a kid's option with unlimited pop and dessert.

I ordered the seared tuna salad with oriental notes. The tuna was fresh, made of good quality fish; accompanied with a half of avocado, edamame beans, nuts, cilantro, and a variety of lettuces. I really liked it...

The sandwich of my friend looked too greasy, and after finishing it, she was totally immobile. But the fries were good.

I guess it's an ok place to go. Not on my list of favourites or recommendations tho."}
{"text":"Stopped in for appetizers and sat in the bar; had a great dining experience. The decor is hip and cool. The bar is expansive. Ordered the calamari - delicious. It was a perfect texture and the sauces were awesome. The bar had a nice vibe awesome party music and sports on all the televisions. Ask for Leslie she is an attentive manager. Bon Appetit!"}
{"text":"So I have to say - I've visited this location after a long long time (since 2012).


I must say clearly Moxies is reading their YELP reviews.

- The food is outstanding (FISH TACOS ANYONE?!?)
- The portions are better and the plates (presentations have been upgraded)
- There are still women wearing short skirts and all but whatever however there seems to be more males working there which is great
- The hosts are great
- The managers that walk around seem to be very pleasant and approachable and fun when they check in with their guests

- Seeing that it is in the mall it's loud but not as loud as I remember and I notice they place larger groups away from small settings which is great."}
{"text":"Decided to come here despite the 3 star reviews, it is 3 star the most. Like all other moxies the lighting is dark, very dark. Ordered potstickers (it doesn't mention on the menu what the pot stickers are filled with, you have to ask), pulled chicken tacos (not worth the price, as the lack flavour and are dry), Penne Toscana (i asked the server to ask the chef to cook it al dente, his reply was that no, we don't cook it al dente, it will come as it comes and that it has been previously overcooked) the pasta was overcooked when it came...cook it less? how hard it is to cook it less. 
Bathroom... Water all over the floor which was very bad."}
{"text":"The evening started off nicely.  I was hungry, it was cold and late.  I walked into Moxie with high hopes and good vibes. The place had some chain-like signs up at the door - but the interior was really well done.  Up to the 3rd floor - where the music was thumping and the lounge/bar was calling.  All the right signals were there. High ceilings, modern design, structural cement walls and wall garden planters.  Nice seating and bar area - and a DJ spinning the latest rap and R&B.  Nice.  I ordered up a beer - a blonde with a vague pilsner taste. Pretty good.  Then things turned on me rather quickly.  I had ordered the salmon Cobb salad.  It was a mistake.  Not a huge mistake.  You never make a huge mistake when you are really hungry.  But a mistake nonetheless.  The salad was basically a chef's wet dream in presentation - but without the recipe to back up the looks.  Iceberg lettuce monster wedge?  Come on.  Who still serves iceberg lettuce?  The dressing tasted oh so heavily of mayo and packaged dressing.  Not cool.  Way not cool.  A lot of things go into a Cobb, mainly the classic ingredients.  Not in this case.

 But I want to come to the defense of Moxie despite my salad worthy of a Hooters (I have never been to Hooters BTW).  Forgetting the uninspired mainstream Canadian/Americana salad, other items on the menu looked pretty good. I found out only after dinner that Moxie's is actually a chain all over Canada.  But this is the first in Montreal.  They should study other chains with healthy and tasty menu items like BJ's Brewhouse and Moxie's would be unstoppable.  

Advice - choose some dish that is difficult to muck up.  Steak or potatoes.  Treat it like driving down the highway...anticipate - look ahead.   Avoid the salads. Drink the beer.  Enjoy the atmosphere.  Service was fine and friendly.  

Just execute better on the food with simple tweaks and success will come."}
{"text":"I've had bad experience after bad experience at this place, but today they really exceeded my expectations and gave me a HORRIBLE experience! Beginning with the hostess, all the way till I got my food, everything was mediocre. We stood at the hostess stand for longer than we should've and when we were finally seated, it took the server about 10 minutes to come greet us. Now mind you, this was at 1 pm and the place was half empty. On top of that, she didn't even bother to ask whether we wanted drinks or we were ready to order, she just told us she would grab some waters for us. Well, it's been 10 minutes so of course I've looked over your menu and I already know what I want - don't waste anymore of our time. This was not an excellent guest experience whatsoever. Our server barely checked on us and looked disinterested and like she'd rather be somewhere else. But wait, I'm not finished yet. Half of their menu (All rice and pasta dishes) was unavailable that day due to some sort of incident in the kitchen. I was understanding and willing to put that aside, but after being treated like I was less than, this was the final nail in the coffin. Don't waste any of your hard earned money here, they don't care about you - all the employees are here to get their pay check and go home."}
{"text":"Since my group didn't have an affordable way to get to downtown Saturday night, we decided to stay local near our airport hotel.  I was sick of horrible hotel food so good food was needed. One of the locals we were hanging out with suggested we check out Moxie since the spot was still open past midnight and was nearby. The restaurant side of Moxie was pretty dead but that was fine since our group was looking for an intimate spot where we could actually hear ourselves.  The spot was pretty cute though they need to have better music selection; they were playing top 40/teen queen/sugar pop music, which doesn't really mesh well.  I may suggest downtempo/lounge music. 

One friend ordered the avocado spring rolls, which were just okay.  Another ordered the dry ribs, which were also just okay and they reminded me of Taiwanese pork chops.  I shared the Mediterranean calamari salad minus the feta, that was pretty tasty, but when is fried foods not? I also ordered the seasonal pulled pork sliders which were really good. I also shared one of the mojito drinks, which would have been better if they had muddled the mint leaves. The chocolate espresso mouse was just okay, I've had better.  The blackberry apple crisp on puff pastry was much better.  

Staff was decent, though it take awhile for the staff to notice we were waiting. The restrooms...I mean washrooms were quite nice looking. A place to check out and stay sane if you're stuck near the airport."}
{"text":"This location never fails to be my last resort of food options. I just live down the street and if I'm catching a flick, moxies is conveniently located at fairview mall. My rating for this restaurant is based on its service, quality of food, and ambience. The service is on the slow side which I can admit have dined here about 10+times this year. The service is consistently slow but the staff are surely friendly. If you are in a rush and need your bill; think ahead. I've missed time play twice. The food quality can have a bit more work as I've had the the quesadillas which the bread was stale, and cabbage had a bland taste. Another dish I always resort to is the fish tacos. In terms of its value it is definitely worth it however, the fish itself could be a bit more seasoned. Once again, a bland taste. A general sense of the food quality definitely is on the underseasoned side however the ambience I will talk about next hits it home. The ambience in the dining room is definitely relaxed and gives the spot an intimate feel with your party. In the lounge area, if you're up for a loud crowd this is where to be. Whatever the mood, you've got both options. Just be aware of the service."}
{"text":"Meh. Nothing special. Nice for a large group."}
{"text":"Half price 6oz glass of wine Tuesdays!  It might just be a coincidence, but I seem to find myself dining here only on a Tuesday.  The décor is modern and sophisticated.  The booths are large and comfortable.  Service is friendly and fast.

Beef Vindaloo $19 - Marinated sirloin, yogurt, curry-buttered naan served on top of jasmine rice.  This dish has a nice kick.

Kale & quinoa salad $15 - Served with lemon vinaigrette, toasted pumpkin seeds, dried currants, grana Padano.  This salad is filling and comes in a generous serving size.

The restaurant is located in Yorkdale Shopping Center, down a set of escalator.  Parking at the mall is free for the first 5 hours.

{"text":"Good service and food but not washroom had pee covering the walls. Which makes me lose my appetite."}
{"text":"Great experience as usual. Even if there's a hiccup inches In a while....
Last night my family and I dropped in for dinner. The service was great, as always decor was beautiful, great atmosphere and cleAn-  we were seated very quickly, we were very pleased that we were able to adjust the kids meal how we/they prefer.  

As always I ordered from the gluten free menu, we had a mix up and I received some bread on the side of my plate (which made my meal not gluten free) - I mentioned it to our server.  She was very apologetic and rushed to send my meal back and have it remade ASAP, within minutes the manager showed up at our table apologizing for the mistake, saying it was unacceptable  and they take allergies very seriously, she went on to to say the meal with be taken care off (free) and if there's anything I would like to have while I wait! And offered some suggestions, Which was very generous and professional! I explained it's ok I appreciate all she had offered and that I'll just wait for my meal.  Minutes later I had received my meal freshly remade following by the manager visiting our table once again, making sure everything was right and also had offered us a Moxies gift card for our next visit and her business card attached and yet another apology! We were so pleased with the service! And once again the food quality was A++ as usual!

Although there was a mistake made, we were very pleased with how quickly it was resolved and how much of an effort was made to make us feel good about our evening and reassure our return visit.

By the end of the evening we discussed booking a large event at this location for the following week!  will return and will always refer our friends and family to this location! GREAT SERVICE AND EXCELLENT FOOD QUALITY!"}
{"text":"Best word to sum up my experience with Moxie's is mediocre. 

For the price you pay, there are definitely better options available, you just gotta do some digging, but that's why you're on here, right? 

The portions are quite generous for the price you pay on items like fish tacos or the salads. The chicken Madeira rigatoni is actually quite good and you can make it vegetarian by subbing with soy protein. Be warned, you will need to take a nap afterwards. 

Service was slow, it didn't look like they were understaffed and the restaurant wasn't overly full so the hold up might have been in the kitchen. 

Also if you're driving in, paid parking is $6/hour underground."}
{"text":"Solid chain food, enjoyed the pot stickers, service excellent and fighting with the other chain bar/restos for guy customers with the waitresses in new black mini skirts with tight orange tops

A little more focus on food and less on \"attractions\" would be nice"}
{"text":"Food Is always hit and miss, ordered the beet salad without greens, quite a bit of push back but it was excellent

Then the beef vindalu , rice was gooey and sauce made it even more so , why not copy japan, rice on one side sauce in a seperate bowl or at least on the other side of the plate so you can blend your own"}
{"text":"This is your typical North American fair, similar to Milestones or Earl's, and similar pricing too. Food is well made and well presented. Good servers, friendly and know their menus."}
{"text":"I came for a week visit to Montreal & was happy to see a Moxies.(they opened I was told in April 2014) I've only eaten in the Toronto locations and have always enjoyed my food there. The servers speak English well and are friendly & efficient. My food came well presented, tasted delicious & is a good price point. It's not expensive. The other thing I loved was my food came quickly compared to the other restaurants I tried in this city! The menu is a nice variety of foods from beef vindaloo to steaks, sandwiches, pasta etc. As for the apps, my family loves the 1 pound of cheese nachos; that's real cheese,(not that process cheese crap) some places put. I always get a side of guacamole. 
This location is very modern chic, amazing upscale casual feel. You can come in jeans & T-shirt or dress up and not feel out of place. I really like the \" cinq a sept\" basically what we call \"happy hour\" In TDot -the place vibes with a DJ every Thursday to Saturday for it. Now back to the food. 
This is the only location I'm told that offers poutine! Loved it. On this visit My family had for dinner : albacore tuna salad plate -wow flavours balanced & tuna rare, great tasting! 
Potstickers : amazing with the pineapple salsa with chili ponzu sauce.
Sirloin with lobster & prawn butter- flavour town a hit! Steak cooked perfect medium rare. 
Calamari appetizer was fried perfectly soft enough on the inside & crispy outside  with two dipping sauces; 1 was sweet chili, other siracha mayo.
We ended our meals off with a scrumptious salted caramel cheesecake. Boom flavour town again! Yum 
Overall we had a great meal & experience here. I'm giving this location 5 stars for executing delicious food that was presented well (not boring!) the vibe,the cleanliness & speed of the food to our table since it's only been open 4 months. Merci Moxies Montreal for being a trusted food resto for my famille."}
{"text":"I was never a fan of Moxie's just because the price is too high for such mediocre food. The atmosphere is alright. The interior is a little too dark for my liking, but that's not much of an issue. My main issue is the waitress we had - Magdalena. She came off very nice and knowledgeable in the beginning, but later on she was rude. She didn't look impressed when I ordered (maybe it's because she was talking to fast that I didn't understand what she was saying) and she didn't look impressed when I asked for my food to go. Maybe she was just born with an angry face, but shoot it wouldn't hurt to smile. 

Now this gives me another reason why I wouldn't want to go back to Moxie's - Thanks Magdalena!"}
{"text":"Really nice decor. Friendly staff. Decent food with really big portions. Trying to be a trendy / cool place to eat, meet and drink; it succeeds except for being in the burbs in a big box mall parking lot. They are building a really nice patio. 

I had the Penne w Bacon; it was entirely different than I expected based on the menu, but I really liked it and would order it again."}
{"text":"Went to Moxies for brunch with a friend and had a great time. Our server, Giancarlo (or johncardio?), was accommodating, attentive and enthusiastic. He had great knowledge of the menu, provided recommendations and overall enriched our experience. I had the Sicilian sausage hash (to die for). I would definitely recommend a visit to this gem in Woodbridge."}

{"text":"I came here for dinner with a bunch of girlfriends and had a great time. Food was delicious. Loved the chicken wing appetizers! The sweet chili chicken appetizer was only ok. I'd skip these next time I think. For the main I had the ribs and chicken with mashed potatoes. The ribs were fall off the bone. The chicken wasn't dry at all but was really salty. The mash potatoes were really good and nicely flavoured. I tried the shrimp which was good and had some steak which was nothing special. I liked their sweet potato fries but not the dipping sauce it came with. Portion sizes are very generous and we were all stuffed. However, girls have an extra stomach for dessert so we ordered a couple of banana caramel xangos. These were so good since they were warm and came with ice cream. I was kind of worried since I deviated from my usual order of white chocolate brownie but was pleasantly surprised! This might even be better...

Our server was awesome! He was super polite, friendly, and patient. He changed a drink for my friend when she commented that she didn't like it. At the end of our meal he even offered to help us take a bunch of group pics!"}
{"text":"We visited Moxies for our first brunch here on Sunday morning. Free brioche bites to start, these were delicious. We both ordered omelettes which were great however my fiancée came across what appeared to be a facial hair in the middle of hers that turned her stomach to the point she completely lost her appetite. Our waitress was great and without any fuss from us went to inform the kitchen staff and the management. Again without a real push or complaint our full bill was comped. This is a real testament to how this establishment deal and manage their clients. I know this can happen anywhere and it really is how the situation is handled that ultimately leaves you with a positive or negative view. This was handled very well and we will absolutely return as up to this point the food was great and service amazing. Thumbs up guys, many establishments that I've dined at and had far worse experiences could take a leaf out of your book."}
{"text":"I have visited several Moxies locations in the GTA over the years & it's clearly my favorite chain restaurant for many reasons. The first is the varied menu, they have items from asian inspired to North American fare such as burgers, wings, ribs,nachos; texmex & Indian(vindaloo is the bomb!); steaks which I've had a few different ones such as honey garlic steak, and recent holiday feature \"millionaire cut steak with truffle butter,served with gnocchi which are light & fluffy. Melts in your mouth. I've tried to order almost everything over the years. I do have my favorites. Some items are a main stay & I love how they have feature menu items seasonally. The balance of flavors in the food, presentation, friendly service & the choice to have a fun upbeat casual experience in the adults only lounge or just trendy enough dining room with a romantic vibe or appeal are also some of the other reasons I tend to favour & enjoy my dining experience here. Along with portion size which is more than adequate & value for your money, I would highly recommend Moxies to anyone, including families."}
{"text":"The food was good but nothing spectacular. My pineapple craft soda was a lot better than my small burger my husband was not even full after he finished eating his burger and even though neither of us got alcohol it didn't make sense for us to walk out with a $60 bill not being completely stuffed. Our friends got a an entree, some beers and a sandwich and spent over $100 that is insane as great as it sounds it was quite a bit disappointing!!"}
{"text":"Called on Friday to get pricing for our office Christmas party and was told to send an email and someone would get back to me within 24 hours. It has been 4 days and I still have not heard from anyone. I called the restaurant this morning & spoke to a manager who said he would have the info to me within the hour. 4 hours later I still do not have the information and when I called back to speak to the manager -Kevin - I was told that he can not give me the information even though he has access to it and that the person who takes care of groups is \"busy running a 10 million dollar restaurant\". Wow..."}
{"text":"There is no reception down in the basement of yorkdale at this moxie's location. 

Came in here for a meal before some shopping, my cell phone had no reception (was not able to check in on yelp!) maybe it was my specific table, but I can't live without my phone. But the booths were good distances apart.

There was no lunch special, just the regular menu, a bit overpriced, and it did not taste really good. I tried a Mexican dish and the steak, the steak was cooked nicely medium rare, but a bit chewy and hard to swallow.

I don't think I would return to this location, even good at the food court is better and better selection."}
{"text":"Service was good considering how packed the restaurant was. It's pretty much Jack Astor's or Kelsey's with a less tacky layout and that is reflected in the price of the meal. It's marginally more expensive, and honestly the food just wasn't good. You can do a lot better at about $30 bucks a head. I think that's pretty much the story with all mid-range places in the area."}
{"text":"To start, I had an amazing time!
Great service, and the best food!
Our server Christina was so kind and 
had amazing recommendations that she
took her time to explain thoroughly, which is
rare for a server!
Thank you for an amazing night out!

{"text":"It feels weird reviewing a franchise restaurant, and it has been awhile if ever I did so.  I guess the reason why is that Moxie's in general have a decent CONCEPT and strength on certain points.

This specific Moxie's near Highway 400 & 7 is most memorable because of their Patio where most of their other's also have as well.  They really make an effort to replicate a HOMEY backyard patio environment with yard sofas, potted flowers, fireplace, etc...  

Secondly is their Wait staff and if you INSPECT closely, you will probably notice at some point that a movie comes to your head.  It is because you have many Lara Crofts running by but instead of holding a couple semi-automatics, they are holding drafts and in this case the BIG ROCK Trio(3 oz Amber, 3 oz Euro, 3 oz Lime for $5.99 or so).  

The last time I checked Angelina Jolie was most popular due to the Tomb Raider movie.  Well you won't miss her much here.

We chatted for quite a while with our Lara Croft, real name Lisa and she was just awesome in every SERVICE aspect.  The other waitresses are just as professional and they work as a team very well from my observation and YES there was lots of observation going on here.

I had the Honey Garlic Chicken Wings(10/$9.99 or another 10 for $9.00 additional).  I actually just kept eating it and didn't think about flavours, I guess I had other things on my MIND.  We were talking about future plans!  Don't think I'm so perverted, lol.

{"text":"service was great, very friendly and coordinated. The food however needs a tonne of work. Ordered the Tuna Salad, leafy greens are bitter. Friend ordered the steak and asked for it to be cooked medium but comes out medium rare. For a $39 steak, I think they should at least cook it to the person's request. On top of that it needs work on flavouring. Tried out the truck taco (pulled chicken) was pretty dry for a taco. Disappointed with the Scarborough Town location and this location too. Won't be eating at this chain anymore."}
{"text":"Served me a BOILED steak that was slapped onto the grill to get the grill marks on for $30. Even though they took it off the bill, we'll probably never come back."}
{"text":"Good food, good atmosphere, good service. 

The staff are such perfect physical specimens I always leave feeling fat and ugly, but maybe that's just me."}
{"text":"Basically, all I can say is they gave me a drink with a straw that had obviously been previously used in another, differently colored drink."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Moxie's to visit, ever! The staff are all so energetic and fun. You can tell they're like family to each other and that they all have amazing chemistry with each other.
The food is always perfect, and you can tell they strive for consistency with excellent quality.
Kennedy is such a joy to see when I come in. She always lights up my day with her sparkling personality."}
{"text":"Haven't been to a Moxie's in ages and decided to try it again for lunch Saturday at Yorkdale. The restaurant has been renovated and is updated. Big booths and comfortable seating. Menu is updated and new options. Good kids menu. We ordered honey garlic wings, fish tacos, salmon avocado Cobb salad, kids grilled cheese. They accommodated a request for cooked vegetables. Pineapple spritzer cocktail was refreshing. Food was great and service attentive and excellent. Ladies washroom is as I remembered with big couch seating inside. I would come back to this place. Comfortable casual eating and great for kids and families."}
{"text":"Another review here states \"Moxies is Moxies\", which is kind of true but at the same time some Moxies are better than others. This location is one of the good ones. Situated not far from Union Station this location boasts an impressive high ceiling dining room and really friendly wait staff who were very attentive to our group of 6. The food was good and the service was pretty punctual especially given that it was during a busy business lunch. I'd definitely go back here again."}
{"text":"I've been to many Moxies locations but never had such a bad experience like this one. To begin with the service took a long time. Otherwise our waitress was nice enough.

We started sharing some med bread and were given guacamole to dip which was a surprise. Later on they tried to charge us extra for this when we didn't order it (I have an oral allergy to it so we would never have done so).

I ordered the souvlaki wrap and our waitress actually told me she wouldn't recommend it (something I've never been told in a restaurant before). I still went with it as id had it and enjoyed it before.

3 in our group ordered the steak sandwich however not a single steak was cooked as ordered. The medium came out without any pink and the two well dones came out pink and even less well done than a medium. We sent one back to be done well but it came back even pinker! None of the meals were hot.

The restaurant were good enough to not charge us for the steak sandwiches but the meal still deserves a low rating."}
{"text":"I had a surprise lunch at Moxie's on a day I hadn't planned to have a lunch at all. With dinner scheduled the same night for Momofuku Shoto, I was planning to do nothing more than chow down a granola bar and stay a little hungry. But then some friends at our convention asked me to tag along, which I did ... but the fact I ate light, having nothing more than a yogurt parfait, means I didn't get a full picture of what Moxie's can do.

All of my friends were eating huge burgers and mounds of fries, and while the aroma was tempting, I stood firm. Oh, well. At least the fruit and granola yogurt parfait was better than most. Still, not much to judge a restaurant on. 

Modern decor, friendly staff, but it'll be up to you to see what they're really capable of."}
{"text":"Always a good time at moxies!

Food and ambience is exceptionally pleasing.  

Try the lettuce wraps! So yummy! Another favourite is the red tai curry! 

Came tonight for desert. Had the white chocolate brownie. (To die for). Service was also great! Our server, Greg, came by every so often to check if we wanted anything else or if we were okay. Nice guy!

Thank you for a great time! 
Will visit again!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday, service was slow, although it was packed and they had 2-3 severs within the area. Drinks came out fine, waitresses forgot to serve us another round when we asked. Restaurant didn't have mashed potatoes (it was 7pm), steak came out alright, had better at similar restaurants. We did not get served small plates or folks for apps to share!

What happened moxies, you used to be my favourite!"}
{"text":"The serve this amazing general Tao cauliflower. It's a great place for a 5a7. The gin and tonic slush is a must."}
{"text":"Waiter very kind, the food a little bit far from what we requested, a friend of mine wanted soup and New York medium well and they didn't bring the soup and the meat was well done, by the time they took for serve he decided to keep it.

Very clean.

For the price and the taste a bit higher the expectation for what we paid."}
{"text":"Had the buttermilk fried chicken sandwich , bf had chicken enchiladas. Both dishes were decent, not bad. Server was alright, they did come often to check which is nice"}
{"text":"APPEARANCE:
-love the look of this restaurant. It's very a cozy and romantic feeling with the dimmed lights. 


SERVICE:
-Our waiter was too busy to greet us so another waitress had to ask us what drinks we wanted and to take our order (which also took a long time). 

-When our actual waiter introduced himself he was friendly but seemed rushed. 

-The wait for our food was another long wait, around 30 mins or so. 

-I had to ask for guacamole on three separate occasions as the waiter forgot to bring it. 

-We had to ask for our dessert twice as he also forgot to bring that as well. And the wait for our dessert was another 30 mins!!!! 

-Overall service was pretty crappy and slow! I understand that wait times on weekends are expected to be longer than usual but this was excessive. Hire more staff to work for busy times! 


FOOD:
-Food was excellent! We got the nachos and bruschetta, both extremely delicious. For dessert we got the white chocolate brownie which is always to die for. 


To sum up, I love Moxies but this location could really improve on their service and efficiency by simply having more staff on hand. I would've rated 5 stars but I did 3 based on the service."}
{"text":"Possibly the only place in Newmarket that opens late (on weeknights) and offers a FULL menu. 
I got the honey garlic chicken wings and the Mosaic Dip. The wings were very tasty but you can never go wrong with wings (crispy and deep fried to perfection). I couldn't compare the dip to anything I have every tried before but it was very tasty ! (made from spinach, goat cheese, and mushrooms). The dip came with tortilla chips and pita bread.
Our server was very friendly and often checked up on us (even though our waters could've been refilled from time to time) but towards the end of the night when we wanted to look at the dessert menu, I felt like we were kind of rushed to order (with 40 mins before close).
Overall we had a decent dining experience and will definitely be returning for the friendly staff and the many options for a late night snack."}
{"text":"May6- was here for dinner. Our waiter was not attentive and was more interested in making out with some girl in a booth. Not professional at all. I was shocked that he had the nerve to do this while he had customers. We had to get up to get the bill after waiting a while.


ive been to this location a few times. i only ever order the peppercorn steak and as usual, it was great. there was only one time when i ordered this and it was half fat. i didnt end up paying for it, but i felt out of place bringing this up to out waitress. the service is good and the food is great. definitely overpriced for what it is. the white chocolate brownie is the greatest. the ambiance is fantastic."}
{"text":"Generally, I love Moxie's!!! It's always my favourite spot when I'm craving tasty food. Everything on the menu is delicious. I came here on Friday for girls night. We ordered a bunch of dishes including Calamari, chicken wings, tuna poke, ginger teriyaki rice bowl and Korean fried cauliflower. Everything was perfect. However, our waiter did NOT check on us at all. She even forgot to get us cutlery it was soooo annoying (why does this always happened at restaurants?!!!). She kept messing up our bills and wasn't paying proper attention to how we wanted it split. I love this location so I'll obviously be returning but I guess it was just one bad experience."}
{"text":"I definitely enjoy Moxies for the food and atmosphere

I was happy that they finally brought a location to Durham region

Restaurant has a nice set up

Service is definitely on point

Friendly staff

Food is always nice

You can't go wrong with anything on the menu

White Zin Sangria is a nice drink when you are not feeling a big boy beer on Friday night"}
{"text":"I know this place is a chain but it was my first time at any Moxie's.  Moxie's was conveniently attached to the Sandman Hotel near the Airport.  I was staying at the hotel for a conference so that's how we ended up here. We went to Moxie's for drinks and dinner. 
It is true, the waitresses are more of a high class Hooters. Waitresses were nice.  The place however is full of men. lol. So I'm in agreement with the other comment - a tad creepy.  lol
The bellini drink that I had was quite good.  The steak was incredible.  Best steak in Calgary (then again i'm only comparing to one other steak).  They did a perfect job at making it medium rare and the seasoning was simple but enough to bring out the flavours of the steak and not take away from it.  
The bathrooms were very clean.  Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"In the past year, i have been getting food at Moxies more often than at other restaurants. This location is the one that I frequent the most. Honestly, the service is okay. Depending on the waitress that is helping you, the wait just for them to come and greet themselves takes about 5 minutes or more. 

This for the most part I don't' usually mind but sometimes when I am picking up food it takes about 5 minutes to get someone (apparently only can be a bartender), to get their attention and grab my food behind the counter. Then it takes another 5-6 minutes WAITING for the bartender to go BACK to the bar and just hand me my food. Other locations will have my food ready to pick up and there is always someone at the bar. This annoys me the most because I call 10 minutes ahead of time for the order and I'm always there before the bartender is. 

Just recently,
I went to pick up food at this location. It was pretty quiet, a few tables with people sitting.. When you're picking up food you have to go straight to the bar. I waited maybe two minutes hoping that the bartender who was having a laugh with a fellow worker by a table, would see that I was patiently waiting at the bar. Obviously not as I stood there, and watched as they just walked right past me even when I tried to get their attention. Instead of a fast pick up I had to make my way to the back of the restaurant just to get any worker's attention. Told them I had been waiting and was told \"Oh well, there should be a bartender there for you\". As I politely told them that there wasn't anyone around, he then said he would fetch the bartender. 5 minutes later, he's finally at the bar, and I get my food. Customer service is really important so hopefully as a team they find better ways to strengthen their service. As I said before it was not even a busy day, and I STILL got the same slacking service I get when it's actually Busy. 

Other than that, I am a huge fan of their calamari, kale salad and penne pasta :D"}
{"text":"I came here for a friend's birthday and it was great! Although it was a weekend evening, our waiter didn't mind that some of our party was almost an hour late. Food was delicious and portions are quite large! I recommend getting a Bellini with your dish too. This location is thriving too so you can always find something to do after you eat. Unfortunately, parking is tough and limited."}
{"text":"What can I say.  It's Moxies.  Only average.  Decent food, and good cocktails.  Usually just visit the Market Mall location"}
{"text":"Food was just ok.  They should stick to their classics.  The chicken enchiladas were not great.  Their burger was good!  Fries average.  Cocktail list is fun but typical for a chain restaurant.  Tables could have been wiped down better as well."}
{"text":"If Moxies were to have a sister, it would definitely be Milestones. I often get these two restaurants confused, for the very fact that they have more or less the same food,

I have been to this Moxies three times, for a bachelorette party,  for a goodbye work thing and a date.  All occasions the staff were pleasant and I had a good meal. I wouldn't say the food is amazing, but all things considered it's pretty good. 

The look and feel of the restaurant is very sleek and sophisticated. One thing I would recommend are the avocado spring rolls, they are probably one of the best things on the menu. 

A good thing about the location of this restaurant is that it connects to the subway. What you say?! There's an underground walkway that connects back to the Sheppard Centre, and the subway. You literally have to walk outside for 15 seconds. The path is below Moxies, to the right of the Extreme Fitness.. you can't miss it!"}
{"text":"Major props to Moxie's! We struck out on 3 other restaurants that were either closed or not child friendly before stumbling in on a cold and windy evening. They handed us crayons and a highchair and the rest is history. Kind and patient staff, really good food (I rec the dirty tacos) and a relaxed but chic atmosphere. I hope you're lucky enough to stumble in here too!"}
{"text":"Amazing customer service and amazing food! We went on New Year's Day; the restaurant wasn't busy. Our server was exceptionally knowledgeable about the menu and vegetarian options. The food came quickly and everything tasted amazing. 

I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Friday night so the place was pretty busy.  I am going to jump right in and talk about the food.  I cannot speak to the food that my companions had, but my NY steak was not up to expectation.  The seasoning was bland.  The beef was anything from tender (but it's was not overcooked) and had no beef taste that's normally accustomed to this cut of beef.  It was more like a top sirloin steak that a NY steak...  I wouldn't be surprised if they had actually given me a top sirloin instead.  The steak came with a small portion of mashed potato and veggie.  For the price paid, I could have gone somewhere else and be a lot more satisfied."}
{"text":"This used to be my favourite place to eat until I had a terrible experience on my anniversary. Our waiter Corey was by far the worst I have ever had, he had an attitude and was extremely disrespectful. I don't know what to say other than if he is your waiter... good luck! Food came out at the wrong times, tasted cold and not fresh, the only thing he was prompt in dropping off was the bill, in which he appeared to be glad that we're leaving. Waste of time and money. Extremely disappointed, actually pissed, never going back. All in all, we would've had a better night at McDonalds"}
{"text":"Came in and watched the raptors get hammered by cavs. Nice sports bar. Had the fish tacos. Solid. Needed some spice. Friend had free range chicken and the other Asian salad. Decent food. Friend complained mixed drink was weak."}
{"text":"Might be one of the worst restaurant experiences I have ever had. I had some very basic requests, as little oil as possible and rice instead of potato with my salmon. When it came there was oily potato and very greasy green beans that look like they were bought dehydrated and half way reconstituted. Unlike other reviews on here my server was actually very accommodating and got me my rice and some more inedible vegetables. I had a similar experience at at the Toronto location so this will for sure be the last time I ever visit a moxies. 
I have been cooking for a living for about 18 years so I really do know how easy it is the accommodate these requests. 
And I really love how they put all of their own professionally done photos on this site."}
{"text":"This branch is across the building I live.I come here often during summer. One evening I came to grab something to eat and just seated at the two seater lounge with my pinot. A guy who was drunk came in roaming around the lounge and ended up sitting with me. I was terrified and wanting to leave good thing a guy tending the bar was so quick to my \"rescue\"  and warned him to stay away or leave. It feels good when you felt like protected when getting into the lounge yourself. Their Alfredo is good, Med-Bread, Mosaic Dip which is half pita and half nachos are good for sharing. Sangria Ros? is good to have before any meal. Wing night every Monday which $3 a pound. They have a new look and no longer having that old feel. Modern and decent."}
{"text":"I just wanted to take a moment and congratulate your organization in the newest Moxie's in Montreal. I have been a Moxie's fan for the last 2 years now, having had many great experiences in your Moxie's in Mississauga Dixon location. Originally going down to Mississauga for work on a regular basis, it allowed us the opportunity to get to know this Moxie's and their staff.

Leading up to the opening of your Montreal location, both myself and my associates were excited to have the Moxie's open up close to home. Upon our first visit in the Montreal Moxie's, we were overjoyed to see your General Manager, Brendon Sequeira as he seems to be a great leader to which ever staff he is delegated. It showed, as his quality of staff in Montreal was as fantastic as the staff he led in Mississauga.

In the last few months, we have celebrated many wonderful events at the Montreal Moxie's, and enjoyed the ambience it brings to the Downtown Montreal vibe! Your staff is courteous, engaging, and the food seems to get better with our favorite's like the Sushi Cones, Steak Salad, and more being the reasons we keep coming back. The Montreal bar staff and bar manager Jordan, continuously engage the guests and ensure super satisfaction which always leads to a great evening! Simply, congratulations on your new Montreal Moxie's, and a job well done."}
{"text":"I've been here before, but it's been quite a while.

I have to say that the service is good. Our waitress decided she was going to join in on a small group selfie of ours, and we were totally down with that. It was quite cute of her. 

Food-wise, I would have to say the food is good, but the price isn't worth it.

Had:

Calamari ($12.99? Something like that ) - For that price, I expected quite a bit more portion-wise. Comparing the portion to other restaurants of the same price point, this was severely lacking. The calamari was not in rings. It was cut into strips. There were also a couple battered shrimps in the mix. The shrimps were overcooked and so was the calamari. None of it was particularly crispy. The batter was not even. Garnish-wise, it was served with deep fried ginger slices (think the Japanese pink ginger) that looked like sweet potato fries in the dim light. That wasn't pleasant biting into solo. *shudders*. It also had deep fried jalapeno slices. Those were quite nice. Not very spicy, but just enough to add a subtle element to the dish. The calamari also came with two dips. One was a spicy mayo (that really wasn't spicy), and a spicy mix between a plum sauce and a vinegar dip. That sauce was spicier than my mayo. 

All in all, not a terrible choice if you just want to spend time with friends, perhaps have a few drinks, and have some food (I tried some of my friend's fries, and those were quite crispy). That being said, choose your food wisely. I wouldn't recommend the calamari."}
{"text":"Great restaurant for couples or group outings.
Great location (if you live in Pickering) with access to the mall and FREE PARKING...
Once again... FREE PARKING..:)

Waitresses are friendly and always willing to help.
Great place for any occasion, especially \"PlayOffs\"..:)

(Yes Moxie, I just gave you a \"Free Plug\" for the NHL & NBA Playoffs...)
Your welcome, hopefully I'm able to receive something in return."}
{"text":"The wings here are probably the best I've ever had! My boyfriend and I always order Honey Garlic + salt and pepper. We usually don't waste time dining in, so we get them to go. The ambience is nice, and the lighting is dim, so It's very comfortable and chill.

The service here is pretty good, the waitresses and servers are all friendly (except one time they wouldn't let us bring our fresh bubble tea inside, which is normal I guess, but sad).

I recommend trying the wings or baby back ribs if you come here!"}
{"text":"We had a group together at Moxie's Woodbridge (hwy7 and Weston) just the past weekend.  I was the person in charge for arranging the food.  I emailed and confirmed from the manager one month prior to our appointment about our reservation and the set menu.  Upon arrival, the server brought us the regular dinner menu (which was not the set menu the manager and I agreed on the email).  I informed the server and she brought another manager over (not the one emailed me as they explain that manager was not working that night).  I showed the attending manager the email and the detailed that was already agreed upon.  IT was good that the attending manager agreed to keep the same set menu I had.  When I received the bill, most of our group already left and therefore I could not check the drinks.  THere were 13 of us and we got charged for 20 drinks.  I asked my group the next day and they all say they ordered one drink each person, only one man order the second time that made to 14 drinks in total.  I want the readers to be careful with the group dining and if you put all in one bill.  The server can cheat you with extra drinks and you cannot check it if most of the group has gone. 

Also, service fee was added for 17% then the regular 13.5% tax on top of the 17% service fee.   Service fee should be added AFTER the total cost of the meal and the 13.5% sales tax.   If it is a small amount, it wouldn't be a problem, but this is a large group of 13 people and their consumption, the 13.5% tax on top of the 17% service fee is unreasonable.  

I will not come back to this restaurant again.  They cheat!!!"}
{"text":"We didnt realize the restaurant was attached to a hotel, so at least it has that going for them. 

Came here for brunch, and while the menu was impressive and the service was fantastic the food was just not. The portions were ok but the main ingredient of the dishes were are so sparse. 

The Smoked Salmon bagel for 13.50 should have more than one sliver of salmon. Same goes for the salmon egg white omelette. The sausage hash was ok, and the pizzas were tasty, just very greasy. 

My son barely touched his grilled cheese as it was very dry and had an embarrassingly thin layer of cheese. 
We enjoyed the brioche French toast the most.

All in all the ambience was nice and the service was great, but if the food isn't good you wont see customers going back."}
{"text":"Where do I start... Simply, this place represents all that is wrong with restaurants, too big, loud, poor service, high prices and that fake smile from employees that just don't care about their jobs.

Sorry for being harsh, but this for me is what I don't want as an elite member.

Went there twice just to make sure my evaluation was on the spot and boom, it is. Walk some more and find another place, with better parking, service and attitude.

Plates were OK, but the service and lack of attention to details just doesn't justify the price...

When the first question I'm asked \"do you have a reservation\" with a ridiculous face when I say no and the place is empty past lunch time, I just don't get it.

I'm sure it could be better and especially sincere."}
{"text":"Love this place! They have nightly drink specials & amazing desserts.  The entrees are great, too.  Some of our colleagues weren't as impressed, but we loved it.  The second visit the service left a lot to be desired as they were VERY slow to wait on us.  Funny thing is it was the same waitress both times.!"}
{"text":"I made reservations for 20-25 around 24 hours prior to the date of the reservation, I spoke with the manager, \"Cedrick\" and he mentioned that they cannot make the reservation for the main dining area, so instead he said he would reserve 5 booths in the lounging area for me. I called back again to confirm and he said that he couldn't wait to meet our party as he was working the same day.

The next day when my guests and I arrived, \"Cedrick\" told me that they don't do reservations and did not recall our phone conversation... not only was I angry that he lied to my face, but he also made it seem like I was crazy.

Luckily, however, because we were a huge party, they made tables available for us in the lounge area. 

My Order: Lobster and Shrimp Linguine as their menu recommended this choice.
When I got it, it was not warm anymore and the lobster that they stated was basically 2.5 inches of HALF a lobster, with 3 shrimps. It tasted average and didn't seem to be worth $30 after tax and tips.

The waitress then asked if we needed anything, we asked for our third round of water (we ate dry and salty food, what can you expect?)

OVERALL: 

Loved:
- decor
- space for groups
- the lounge
- SOME of the staff
- portion (not in size wise, but it was filling)

Disappointed:
- Manager
- Reservation service
- SOME of the staff
- food

Maybe will come back if I want to just have a night to drink out and lounge or if there is ABSOLUTELY no other option, other than that, no."}
{"text":"Near home and the only decent place the tis open for lunch on Victoria Day! Quality has been pretty consistent. 
Nice dining environment and attentive waiter (who always got down to our level and talk to us with smile on his face). My son likes their artwork sheet for kids and their fries (burger from kid's menu tastes quite good, but probably he wasn't interested in the charred flavor of the patty.)
Mosaic dip with goat cheese and mushroom is delicious when it's hot, and I'd ask for all nachos instead of half pitta bread and half nachos. 
Calamari is not chewy enough for Chinese it's a sign of \"not fresh enough\";
Peppercorn New York steak medium, with jacket potato, yum.
Steak salad is a bit too sweet, take like Cantonese roast pork (char siu)
My favorite of the meal: white chocolate brownie, good for sharing among 2-4 friends. 
P.s. I have doubt on the steelhead salmon on their menu so didn't try."}
{"text":"Best Moxie's I have been to. Try their Beef Vindaloo. It's the best I have tried. Now more impressing than the food is the service I have always received from Nibil. (I hope I'm spelling your name right). The first time he served us he was so friendly and passionate about what he does that now every time we go back we ask for him."}
{"text":"I went here last night to meet my family for dinner.


First off, where is \"Newmarket\"?

Anyways, this was actually my first \"meal\" forray into a Moxies. Shocking, I know.

Sat down with ma famjam's in a round booth contraption that I didn't really fit in. 

Woops.

Anyways, my family had already ordered the bruschetta (or bruskies as I like to call them, not to be confused with the ever popular frat boy term \"Brewskis\") 

I'm not going to judge it because it was sitting around for liek 20 minutes, but lets justt say it was like eating a mildly tomatoe'd rock.

Anyways.

I ordered the Mediterranean burger. 

Burger patty, with feta and a pesto-y sauce. Flavours were awesome! Burger patty itself was way overdone and too charcoaly aka burnt. If the burger wasn't burnt, i'd say 4 stars, cause it was delicious none the less.


The fries were just fries.


My mom/sister has the peppercorn steak, and it was okay. the brandy sauce was nasty in my opinion.
but i dont like brandy anyways.

the cool thing was though the ice cream came in this awesome bowl with dry ice underneath, and it made my 3 year old niece's day. honestly. that girl. biggest smile. i almost cried watching her smile. kids are fucking amazing.

maybe i need to give moxies another chance. we'll see what happens 

2.5, but ill round it to three because even though the service was mildly terrible, the staff was super nice and i could tell that she was mad overworked. not her fault. she was doing the whole dining room herself."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. The food wasn't bad but since it's a franchise, I didn't get the local feel for being in Montreal.  Lunch is filled with business attired folks so I may bring my team here rather than a casual dining with friends.  As said earlier, the food is just ok and the music could be a bit too loud.  It's also part of the condo so you have to walk up two flights of stairs to get to the dining room.

Food: 2/5, I got the mango chicken as recommended and it was just ok.

Service: 1/5, quite slow and the waiter just came once to attend us (when he took our order) took about 20mins to pay.

Ambience: 3/5, the decor is nice and cool dining place.  It's lighter than other moxies possibly due to multiple stories with an open concept. 

Price: 2/5, about $30+ with drinks.  Not sure if my food was worth it.

Please note that I understand chains and Moxies failed to wow me several times.  I prefer Baton Rouge; they are more consistent and give you a more fine dining at a chain experience."}
{"text":"The restaurant did not meet my expectations the decor was nice and the service was excellent but the food  left a lot to be desired. The baked potato was not good at all.the vegetables were under cooked. The desert was very good we sent our coffee back cause it was lukewarm overall I was not impressed."}
{"text":"This place is an upscale bar & restaurant chain with an excellent environment to catch the latest sporting event.  I sat at the bar and was impressed with the décor.  Everything from granite bar tops to embossed leather seats made for a nice environment.  You could tell it had a woman's touch.  My barkeep, Andrew, tends a hell of a bar.  I saw him doing everything from concocting sangria from scratch to keeping an older lady patron happy with a few corny jokes.  

Their drink list is vast and they have a plethora of drink specials depending on the night for those on a budget.  My meal was pretty good.  I got the parmesan chicken and prosciutto sandwich, which was really rich and filling.  The side sweet potato fries were not good.  They were about as soft and lifeless as the kid that gets picked last in dodgeball.  Moxie's had a great turnout for a random Monday night.  I wouldn't hesitate to come back as the service, environment, and diverse menu made for a nice night out."}
{"text":"I've really expected this place to be bad, but it was actually great. 

I wasn't feeling too well, so I was being very careful with my food - the place passed the tender stomach test, with flying colours - my salmon was excellent, with no after effects. 

My kids loved the volcano ice cream - definitely a nice touch. 

May repeat."}
{"text":"Just like Virtigo, the next door restaurant, Moxie's has failed to impress in my opinion 
I am not keen on the decor to start with - those high and heavy stools are difficult to sit on, hard to move to come closer to the table and very high for someone of my hight ! 
The food choices and menu I like 
But service is just appalling"}
{"text":"Moxies is moxies. You come here, probably after work for a drink or ten. 
Mediocre food, beautiful waitresses and pricey drinks. It's pretty average for one of 'these' bars/lounges. I end up coming here because my work is in the building right above it; I don't even have to walk outside to go here, so that's convenient. No, literally - I left work at 5:12 and sat down at my table at 5:13. 

This place is always busy, especially if you're going after work. I didn't realize there was a huge back area where there's more room at the bar and at the tables there. 

Moxies has a lot more options on their menu now than they did a few years ago. They also have drink specials everyday, and a ton of 'girly' drinks that are hella delicious. I always end up ordering my staple drink though - stella. What can I say? The taste of the crisp beer always ends my Friday well. Stella's ma girl.
I also ordered the bruschetta to share and that was bomb.com + of course the veggie lettuce wraps - an appie filling enough for a meal. Yum. The ratio of noodle/peanut filling definitely needs to be higher for the amount of lettuce they provide. 

There's not much attention given to the back, we had to ask for our waitress and when our food came, it was delivered to the wrong table 3 times before it came to us, as I watched with my hungry eyes. I was hella hangry. Also, tables of 10+ is 18% gratuity, which is standard. I was charged an extra dollar on the final amount (it was $34ish and was charged $35 something), which is not a big deal but I'm just confused as why to.. didn't have time to ask, as I had to rush to catch the go train. 

Overall, it's average. Not amazing, not horrible. I'll probably return."}
{"text":"I came here on a weekday for my friend party.

The environment was what I would expect from a place like this.  They played music with good beats, it felt like I was at some club.   But surprisingly the music actually worked pretty well with the place and the atmosphere.   

I ordered a seafood crab linguine, it was surprisingly yummy though a bit on the heavy side and also a bit oily.   Service was pretty good and attentive even with such a large party.

To me this is definitely a place to bring a group of friends but not really if it was a one on one."}
{"text":"Must try on your list the calamari and lettuce wraps. the rack of ribs are good reminds me of chills back in the states."}
{"text":"Meh... Would not come here on my own dime. If you do come the service is good and food is ok. Price is just a bit too high. Nice location"}
{"text":"Came here today for lunch at around 12:30PM. It was my first time at this location and not a very pleasant experience. We have ordered the sweet chilli chicken as an appetizer tasted good and flavourful but that was it. It was the only thing that tasted decent. We ordered two steak burgers as a main. First off it took 47 minutes for it to arrive. Second it tasted really bland and no flavour at all. The steak was grey and old. Not fresh at all. Major disappointment that i have ordered mine medium and i received it rare. Didnt bother to complain as i didnt want to wait for another 50 minutes. service was friendly though but wont come here again. 
Waste of money and time. Avoid this location and try other restaurants in that area."}
{"text":"New location @squareone gets 5 stars!! Loved the food it was great! bartenders were fun and nice! It was packed had to wait a bit but so worth it! Moxies is killing it! Hubby didn't eat much and I ate his food too cuz I'm a fatso or maybe I was just too hungry  get ribs &chicken w peppercorn sauce and stuffed potato yum"}
{"text":"Romantic atmosphere - perfect for dates. The service could be better, waitress tend to be busier with bigger tables. The white chocolate brownie is a MUST. Weekends usually tend to be really packed, especially for dinners, so call in and make reservations! I also really love their salmon, average size but really yum!! If only the service was a better, I would rate this a 5! However, their food never disappointed me!"}
{"text":"Really awesome place to dine at. Even tho they are s chain and the food is the same at all of their GTA locations but the food is amazing. Really enjoy coming here to eat and have some sweets after the meal."}
{"text":"I want to like this place but I just can't. The drinks are not good. Beer & wine obviously fine but so what, you can have a beer or glass of wine anywhere. The margarita is huge but has only 1oz of tequila so it tastes like a slushy. The white sangria tastes like pop reminiscent of Tahiti Treat. Terrible. 

The food is mediocre at best. 

I would give it 2 stars but the service & ambiance deserve a mention & that it does right. 

Final verdict- Skip it"}
{"text":"SURPRISE --- Moxie's does survey breakfast/ brunch on Sunday morning. Not busy because they do not advertise breakfast online ( no menu shown ). Even the opening time is different than posted online. Strange for a big company .
Service at 10:30 was good but sparse as was the number of clients on March 11 ( only 4 tables) . By 11:30 that number was 8 tables. Food was good."}
{"text":"Moxie's is a great place for appetizers and drinks by the bar, not necessarily the best place for dinner. I've tried a lot of items on the menu and I have to say they're really not that tasty for the price. I would much rather spend a fraction more to visit a competitor. The service is inconsistent sometimes we get a super cool and nice waiter, other times we get an aggressive waitress. I tried the new fried chicken sandwich with a side of sweet potato fries. The fries tasted like very manufactured frozen fries and the sandwich was overwhelming. The bun turned soggy fast so maybe a drier slaw or toastier bun will help. The crispy chicken skin easily detached from the meat...that's a first for me (not a good thing). I know from before their steak salad is amazing so I probably will only order that from now on.
The appetizers are lacklustre as well. They simply don't taste good. I ordered the tuna poke with fried nori chips and indo flatbread. Both of them didn't have unified composed flavours. The tuna poke was hard to eat and I would've appreciated the tomatoes and avocados to be more mixed together. They had them in layers in a super tiny jar which made it difficult to get a taste of everything. The indo flatbread was weird..a little spice, some dried pork floss and cheese, which did not sit well.

Definitely just come here for happy hour half priced apps and drinks because they are really not worth the full price!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant with a wide variety of options to choose from the menu! I love the enchiladas and dessert options. The lighting is a little dark but gives a more private and intimate setting. Service is great and overall one of my fav places to eat in Calgary!"}
{"text":"Steak was cooked properly.  Although never worth 31$.  Inferior quality but amazing service and cooks.  Burgers are good and chicken wuesadea was good.  Been here before and downtown had a nicer atmosphere.  If u have nowhere to go and are trapped in the sandman hotel, eat here."}
{"text":"I used to be a frequent patron of Moxie's and have always had a good experience there, whether it is for date night, birthdays, girls'night out, etc. However, my most recent visit was disappointing to say the least and completed tainted my view of this establishment. I usually dress up when I go out, but I just finished a long shift and just wanted take-out so my coworker and I went there for just that. We went in and told the hostesses we were there for take out. They directed us to the bar and said we could order there. I went up to the bartender and asked for a kale and quinoa salad to which he looked at me without a smile and shouted, \"that's it?\" He proceeded with whatever he was doing before and completed ignored me. I wasn't even sure if he got my order or if he was just going to pretend I wasn't right in front of him. I had to find another person to fill my order but unfortunately, she wasn't any better. At least she took my order though. She did not greet me, thank me, or even speak with me except to hand over the credit card machine. I don't think it should matter if I'm dressed down or up but you just treat every customer the same. Clearly, that wasn't the case with this place. My coworker was treated exactly the same and noticed the girl next to us getting way better customer service. Even though I used to like this place, I don't know if I will ever come here again since I didn't feel appreciated as a customer. Actually, it was a very dehumanizing experience that I will be sure to share with my family and friends."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here on a Tuesday night. We were able to be seated within 5 minutes. The drinks and food all arrived at appropriate times; the pacing was just right.

We got Bellinis to drink and a mosaic dip to start. They were great as usual. The server offered us extra bread for the dip. That pretty much filled us up!

For entrees, we got the beef dip and the chicken Chipotle quesadilla. After the app, we could barely touch our entrees! Everything was delicious however, the quesadillas did not taste like there was any cheese in it. It could definitely have more cheese and a little more flavour, especially if I want to enjoy it by itself without the dip.

While the server wasn't the most enthusiastic, he did not rush us at all and refilled our waters accordingly. Overall, we had a good experience with both food and service."}
{"text":"Came here with my brother to watch the game and enjoyed great chicken wings and the house-brewed beer served by beautiful women in an upscale setting. Primo is a fan and would definitely return."}
{"text":"Noisy. Good service.  Above average food.  Go a little early and avoid the rush."}
{"text":"Big letdown. Unprofessional staff.

Slow service and unfriendly staff killed my mood.

It's a shame. I liked this place a lot."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and the food has been great both times but the service is extremely slow. We asked for our check and it took 15 minutes for the server to bring it to us and then another 15 minutes for him to come back when we gave
Our cards. Drinks took 15 mins and Food took 30 mins to come out. 

When we told the manager he didn't seem to care. The atmosphere is nice and the food is great, but the service really takes away from the experience."}
{"text":"We went here the other day for my parent's anniversary. I used to go all the time some years ago, and was excited. It was a disappointing experience.

First, the positives. Our server Tristan was pleasant, if not entirely attentive. The potstickers and Calamari were tasty, although the teriaki corn salsa was a bot of an odd choice for potsticker sauce. The vindaloo was excellent.

The kids menu had only three items, at least one of which was coated in their awful 'rustic tomato sauce'.

The tomato sauce , which was used in everyone else's meal (pizza sauce, red thai curry and prawn linguini) was the most horrifying thing I've ever paid that much money for. In a word : bitter. 

There was no hint of garlic taste, no taste of herbs, not even the actual taste of a tomato. Just bitterness. And the hard inside stems were still in my tomatoes!

We ate the seafood in our dishes and left the rest untouched. 

Very disappointing. Will not go back, unless their head chef actually does quality control!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner after a mini shopping trip. It's a nice atmosphere. Servers are nice but it is busy there so it might be difficult to get their attention once in a while. I like how they a have a drink special everyday, especially their mon-thurs Bellini special. I'm a fan of cocktails and I always order the Bellini whenever I go to different movies location. However this time at this location my Bellini was like a fruit slush. I didn't taste any alcohol, maybe a very very mild taste but I think it should have definitely been more as I've had it many times already. I suggested to the server that I didn't taste anything but he just said that there was. I tried the drink a few more times and since my server didn't get the hint, I asked him if he can add a little more alcohol to it haha. I think it was the manager who came afterward to explain how a Bellini should taste like. I told him it was different than other Moxis and it was agreed that every place makes it different. Other location also include a candy on top of it as well. Anyways I order their pasta and burger. All tastes good but the pasta portion were pretty small. Probably go there to try more unique dishes there like the ethnic ones that they offer. More bang for your buck."}
{"text":"The staff here is really great, and the service is prompt. We ordered the tuna salad and spicy tuna roll, which were both dressed nicely. I would definitely come back again if I'm in the area. It's probably the best option of the restaurants around stc, if you're looking for a place that's classier than jacks and taster than Milestones."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant/bar. They are right next door to a hotel as well. I went for brunch but they also had their full menu available. Nicely set up with booths, tables, and seats at the bar. I wouldn't say it was formal but it had an upscale feel abs vibe to it but casual at the sametime. 
I think there was a mm outdoor seating area as well. There was some booths on a little bit of a rider which was cool.
The food and service were good. 
I had the breakfast and it was filling and good. Cage free eggs which is good."}
{"text":"Contrary to past reviews, I had a very pleasant experience at this Moxie's. I thought the service was great, very attentive and nice. Went for brunch and the food was good."}
{"text":"My friends and I went here late at night, and we just ordered appetizers. We had the Calamari and the Chicken Nachos, and I have to say both of them tasted very mediocre. I feel like more flavor could of have been added to both dishes. The atmosphere of the restaurant was very pleasant, and the staff were very friendly!"}
{"text":"We stopped for drinks and appetizer.  Nachos were plentiful and yummy.  Lots of nice options on the menu.  Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times before and love the new brighter renovations that have been done.  Also really enjoyed the updated menu.  The service was almost over the top as the waitress was constantly at our table and so it was hard to have a deep conversation with the constant interruptions.  Likely due to it not being a busy night.  I will be back again to sample more of the menu."}
{"text":"Then my meal came.  I was enjoying the great service, the nice surroundings and then my meal came.

I ordered the Lobster & Shrimp Linguini, which at $23 was a bit of a fat whack, but I do love seafood.  Besides, the business associate that invited me was paying.  

The dish arrived with a half tail of lobster, which was about the size of a large langoustine, or one of the jumbo shrimp at St. Lawrence Market.  That was it for the lobster.  Also included were 4 medium shrimp.  That was it for the shrimp.  That was it for the seafood.  That was it for $23.

Sorry, Charlie..."}
{"text":"I would give this place negative 100 stars if I could. 
Let me elaborate, my and my boyfriend along with two other friends were there for dinner on a not so busy weekday. We sat down, the waitress came, blah blah blah. By the time we were ready to order, I asked the waitress if one particular item on the menu contain any animal ingredients and if so, is there a way to modify (veganize) it. My boyfriend also wanted a vegan dish so I kept on going and asked about one other dish on the menu. I never felt so offended before because the waitress clearly did not care for providing good service, SHE ROLLED HER EYEBALLS WHILE CARELESSLY ANSWERING MY QUEATIONS. 
And she also said \"omg vegan?! I wish I could do that\" along with her eye rolling motions. 
I felt like I was judged so hard, and even discriminated because of my dietary choices -- by a waitress, the person who is suppose to provide good service! 
Let's leave the vegan part aside, would she have done this to someone with allergy to dairy/egg/other animal products? I don't know. But she shouldn't. The fact that this happened to me because I'm chose not to eat dead animal flesh or the product from abusing their sexual organs is UNACCEPTABLE! 
I WILL NOT BE GOING TO THIS RESTAURANT EVER AGAIN, AND I WILL ADVISE ALL MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY THE SAME."}
{"text":"Moxies has shifted a bit more upscale since the last time I went.  I stopped in mid afternoon for a late lunch.  I guess I missed the lunch menu, because I was looking at entrees ranging from $18 - $26--not what I'm used to seeing from Moxies.

I ordered the sandwich combo, a bowl of thick Broccoli Cheese Soup paired with a Beef Dip.  The soup was hearty, loaded with shredded cheese and fresh, crisp broccoli tops.  The sandwich had a generous portion of beef, with mushrooms and nice seasoning.  For $11, this was a great option.  I left comfortably filled at a respectable price.

Arriving at 2 PM was a problem.  Evidently, there was no wait staff around.  After being seated by the hostess, I waited 15 minutes until I caught a glimpse of a server.  Still, I will go back for the soup and sandwich, but at lunchtime..."}
{"text":"I have been to this location several times. Their management and staff continue to impress me with great service and the food is as expected with Moxie's which is very very good.  Happy to return and hoping Tom continues to be the manager."}
{"text":"Terrible. I ordered a drink and  chicken pasta Alfredo. They didn't have any sauce.. I had to ask to sauce. After that i noticed that they didn't add chicken. I had to wait 10 mins after my friends to get the food and they forgot  the sauce again. Not coming back .. My friends had the same problem."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of Moxie's but this is definitely one of the best Moxie's I've been to.

We came here a couple of weeks ago for a belated birthday lunch with my parents and then again last weekend for my Dad's birthday/Mother's day lunch.

On the first occasion, I was all set to order the double stacked turkey club but when I saw eggs benny on the brunch menu, I couldn't resist... although the next time I had no issues resisting!

Not exactly the best eggs benny I've had but it was an interesting twist on the traditional. I'm not quite sure what the eggs were presented on... it was sort of like a flat bread but quite doughy then thin slices of pancetta, aged white cheddar cheese, perfectly poached eggs and a hollandaise sauce that had started to separate. It was accompanied by rösti potatoes (which were fabulous) and fresh fruit.

Both my Dad and I ordered this dish and neither of us we overly impressed by it and I was left wishing I had stuck with my original plan of the double stacked turkey club... which needless to say, my husband opted for!

A small bite of his sandwich confirmed my error in judgement soooo... the following weekend when we were back all four of us ordered the club!

Definitely a better bang for your buck as this sandwich is fantastic and very filling! We all enjoyed our lunch and I do have to say, the service at this Moxie's is superb! Both times the manager came out for a chat and to make sure all was well. The waiters we had on each occasion were attentive and friendly.

Although it's one of the more higher priced restaurants in Pickering, I will definitely be back.

Well done Moxie's and welcome to Pickering!

(Lost a star only because their eggs benny really does need to have more substance to it.)"}
{"text":"I came here the other night for a work function and was a little sceptical after reading some of the reviews.

The restaurant itself has a beautiful decor and is excellent for groups and intimate dinners alike. As mentioned in previous reviews, there were a few waitresses who's attire resembled that of a two-bit slapper however our server, Maria, was dressed quite sharp and presented herself in a professional and courteous manner.

I ordered the Beef Vindaloo but substituted the beef for chicken ($16.99). As described, this dish certainly is rich and spicy but not overpoweringly so. The menu speaks of shredded sweet coconut however I didn't see or taste any in the dish I had. Over all though, it was very tasty and I would order it again.

We had a great time and the service we received by Maria and her team was excellent.

A note about parking and subway access: There's an underground parking lot located on Upper Madison Avenue for which Moxie's will validate parking (after 5pm) and they are also connected to the subway via the Madison Centre tunnel. It's not completely underground door-to-door but rather comes out beside the wooden revolving doors that used to be the entrance to The Keg at the Sheppard Centre. From there, it's a hop, skip and a jump into the Sheppard Centre and you're on your way.

The tunnel is rather isolated in areas and I found that there really weren't enough security cameras to make me feel at ease. I would imagine that during regular business hours it would be fine but I was glad I had someone with me when I walked through there closer to 8pm."}
{"text":"The food at Moxie's is pretty good the only thing is if you're coming at lunchtime, the menu seem to get smaller and smaller throughout the years I've been there before used to get a bigger money with a bigger selection but now it's literally just a piece of paper off a couple of food options.  

Honestly, I would rather come back for dinner than lunchtime again I'm not saying the food taste bad I think the lunch menu deserve some variety too! 

Lastly, I think the service is a little slow even when the restaurant isn't even super packed."}
{"text":"Mmmmmmeh.  I had high hopes for my rare-ish foray into pseudo-upscale western-ish food, and the experience was so-so..

The Moxie's is in Fairview Mall and is actually quite nicely decked out - with a few separate seating areas; our group sat in the age-restricted lounge, which was actually quite large - big enough to be a restaurant on its own.  The place was quite busy for a Tuesday night (full at 8pm), and the wait staff was the usual complement of skinny girls with short skirts..  

Service was good - the waitress was friendly and orders were taken promptly and delivered fairly quickly for such a busy night.  When it came time to pay, she would parachute in to advance the wireless payment terminal to the next person at the table and then disappear to serve another table while details were being entered.  Efficient - I'll give her that.

Food/drinks were a mixed bag.  Our beer came in different glasses even though we ordered the same thing - strange for a place like this, though the amber house special brew was actually quite good.  Scanning the food menu, I scoffed at the $16 banh mi and opted for the $25 chicken/rib.  The ribs ended up quite nice and tender, and the mashed potatoes were fantastic, but the mango chicken - totally flat, dry, chewy, and tasteless.  I could barely cut into it and it had the consistency, shape, and culinary appeal of the sole of my shoe.  I'm no chef, but I have a really hard time screwing up a chicken breast at home - it's not rocket science, and Moxie's - you failed miserably here.

So there you have it - an ok experience, but not a stellar one.  I enjoyed the company much more than the food.  That said, I'd come back for the ambience and try some other dishes.  Definitely make reservations though.. Oh, and last note - the bathrooms were pretty nice - if you care about things like that and you're someone who needs to pee on occasion.  Or maybe you just need to discreetly bring up a piece of nasty chicken.  Bon appetit.."}
{"text":"A Today went out for lunch with my brother and friend... My meal was going great only to find a long black hair in my food... I was so disgusted I had to spit out my food... The manager came over and all he offered me was an espresso... Without an apology"}
{"text":"I requested no onions in my pasta and when I received the pasta it had onions. I was unable to get a hold of our waiter since he never showed up to ask how the food was so I was forced to eat it while I was picking out the onions at the same time. When he finally came around I mentioned what had happened and he promised we would get a refund on it. He comes back saying the manager refused to do so because we didn't tell them before we ate it. ??? Maybe if I even got service in the first place I could tell them. He should not have promised something that he couldn't do as well. Horrible service."}
{"text":"We go to this Moxies quite a bit as we live very close. The service is good but once every blue moon it is honestly completely absent. The food is pretty good, the ambiance is good and the servers are very kind. 

Only 4 stars because of the occasional time your server disappears, but it's not a big enough deal for me to not go back."}
{"text":"Very nice food and service. Very underrated wing night. Great price. Moxies is one of those chain restaurants that seems to be great everywhere you go. Everything is really good here including service but can't help but I wish atmosphere wasn't as casual"}
{"text":"Came here for a big group bday dinner and expected a long table but instead we were brought over to a section where there was four booths, two on each side, which seemed very odd and very unusual.

Nothing stood out on the menu so I went with a burger.  Burger came out looking like the burger was made at A & W, literally with a paper bag -  Ok Burger and fries were crispy and  surprisingly good, 

I asked my friend what they thought of the ribs and chicken. It was decent. 

Our waitress was still green but she was kind and nice and made sure to always bring water (without even asking) to our table. She also did the split bills at our table and even wrote Thanks :) 

Would I come go back? With so many other choices in the neighbourhoud, this will probably be my last option to come back as I don't feel the value is there.

Nice of the restaurant to give out a free dessert to the birthday boy."}
{"text":"Went here last night after a long time. The new restaurant looks amazing but that's where it ends. Service was horrible from the start. Walked in and said my wife and I were there to meet a party and we were told to 'go in and find them'. Was taken aback by this but shrugged it off. It didn't end there. We essentially had no service all night,  had to hunt down the waitresses. Water was never refilled the 3 hours I spent there with my party. Asking for an additional seat for our table seemed like the biggest hassle for the waitress and the manager wasn't anymore help. Very surprised by the pretentious nature of the serving staff. Definitely not going back."}
{"text":"Friday night, I went to Moxies for dinner and drinks with my gals.
We arrived around 8ish and we didn't make reservations so when they said it would be a 20 minute wait, we waited. Luckily, the wait was only 10 minutes.

Our server was a pretty girl who instantly rubbed us the wrong way. When she approached us, she just didn't have a personable attitude and looked away and down while reading the specials. It didn't come across as her being nervous, but more so as if she was bored and sick of repeating herself. We just brushed the little attitude off.

We ordered a bottle of wine and she brought it to the table and took our orders. After ordering she asked if we had any allergies. My friend has a peanut allergy and she awkwardly held her hand out and said \"I'm going to have to check with the kitchen\". The hand out really threw us off because we weren't sure what she was reaching for. So each of us are confused \"Check with the kitchen for what?\" Her hand is still out and she's like \"I have to check with the kitchen to see if there's any peanuts\".  Again, we are confused by the hand because she was reaching it out over the table to my friend who had the peanut allergy. It looked like she was asking for the wine back. So, my friend asks \"There's peanuts in the wine?\" And the waitress said \"No, I'll ask if there's any in the food you ordered. I need the menus.\" So that's why her hand was out like that for the awkwardest 15 seconds ever.

Our food came in a decent manner but when she brought out our appetizers she literally clanked the dishes down so hard it made us all jump and stop in the middle of our conversation. She also didn't apologize for the startle. When she was collecting everyone's empty plate, my dish was left on the table with food still on it. It was clear it was a lot of food but she never asked if I was still eating, if I needed it packed up or if everything was ok with my food. I had to ask her if I could get a container to take food home in.

She brought me the smallest container ever. I had 3 quesadilla's that I forced into this miniscule box that is most likely meant to carry home some fries. She also then gives me the biggest brown paper bag ever. This bag could have literally held knee high boots, it was that big.  I know I could have asked for a bigger box and smaller bag but if it didn't occur her to that what she was absurd, I just couldn't be bothered to explain at this point. 

I can understand not being in a great mood, but in general I just don't think she gave a rats a** about her job. It was very apparent she had no interest in taking care of the customers.
Needless to say she didn't get a good tip."}
{"text":"Food is very institutional & poorly prepared. For example, the dry ribs are dusted with some sort of flavourless coating that really wrecks them.   The Asian Chicken salad is apparently a \"signature\" piece by a consulting executive chef - and it's terrible while being prepared with a complete lack of skill or understanding of food.   This place is best avoided.  Service in inattentive and slow."}
{"text":"A higher class Hooters, just as tacky but with good food.

I do enjoy going to this place because the food is pretty good and it's right next to the Marriott Courtyard which serves microwaved food. However you can't help but feel like a creep going into the place. 99% of the staff are attractive girls wearing low tops and short short skirts. 99% of the patrons are overweight business men who like to stare at ass. 

Who doesn't? Right? I don't know. It's still creepy."}
{"text":"Very expensive for food that just isn't that great. The desserts are the only thing I would consider worth the price."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a Saturday. Service was excellent. 

I ordered the fish tacos that came with house salad. The tacos were great. The salad I didn't like I can't put my finger on it but I didn't like it at all it may have been the dressing or lack of it."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant with a classy feel and friendly service in the Sandman Hotel in Downtown Calgary. We were on business and it's a good place for a lowkey business meal or catching up over drinks. The young staff were delightfully friendly and attentive - don't know if it's just this restaurant or maybe Calgary people are just friendly overall. My club sandwich was fine with no complaints. 

Bottom line: Liked this place and would come back if I'm ever back in downtown Calgary. Good overall friendly experience."}
{"text":"One of the best things about the restaurants at Square One is that they are a great place for social gatherings. Moxie's has good food, as well as a great atmosphere for grabbing drinks and catching up with friends. When I came, I got the lettuce wraps. It's an appetizer, so it's a bit cheaper, but it also has enough substance to leave you with a full stomach. The filling for the wraps (noodles and pickled veggies) was really good, and there was a good quantity of lettuce for the wraps. I like that the guest gets to build the wraps themselves. One critique I had with the dish is that the white, ranch-like sauce tasted kind of out of place with the other ingredients. Additionally, Moxie's is on the pricier side, so entree prices can definitely add up.

Our server was great; he made sure to interact with everybody at the table and seemed to really care about how our food tasted. He came back consistently to check up on how we were doing, and was overall really funny and considerate.

Verdict: Good restaurant to socialize at because of its prime location in Mississauga."}
{"text":"Came here once to celebrate a girlfriend's birthday. I ordered the red thai curry chicken and it did not taste as good as it looked. Extremely slow service, too. Other than that, good ambiance and friendly waiters. I won't be returning any time soon."}
{"text":"We were all very happy with this restaurant. We actually came back again for lunch....2nd day in a row. Fantastic service, great menu and and reasonable priced. This is such a great lunch spot for big groups as the menu has everything yet it's still closer to a premiums spot than some of the other restaurants in this business park. Everyone in our group was very pleased with his or her meal. Definitely cannot go wrong with this menu and service Ali g with the price too! A solid spot that is clean, good and just simply one of the best lunch spot around. I really enjoyed the Caesar Salad as well as the pot stickers. They also have great wings and great fish tacos. We weren't drinking but the bar looked amazing. Perhaps we will have to come back for dinner in the near future. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is one of my place to go for a decent meal at a reasonable price. The calamari is made fresh not like most other place that does the rings from frozen. Tonight I had the shrimp linguini and it was delicious. I would recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Tonight was mother daughter date-we booked a room at the sandman and ha decided to have dinner at Moxies. We were sat right away and waited over 15 minutes to be asked for a drink - so I went and found a server 

We ordered a Vrigin Mojito and a Bellini and our friend  who joined us soda water.  Our drinks came and they brought a virgin margarita. She brought the right drink after we told her, however forgot the syrup in it. 

We ordered the iceberg lettuce wraps - chicken wings - sweet chilli chicken - tuna in a jar.
The tuna was gross, the wraps so salty - and the chips that come with the sweet chilli chicken were taco flavour - it didn't work with the taste of the chicken.

Out drinks were empty, food gross and the server couldn't handle her 6 tables. They did take most of the food off the bill and gave us free dessert - but I wouldn't recommend coming here - I'll never be back."}
{"text":"The service was great, food was good, and the venu was not my favourite. The booths were very low to the ground and hard on the back. The tables were awkwardly high (chest level and above for me - although to be fair, I am short). It was very dim lighting. I had the top sirloin and it was tasty and properly cooked. The quinoa was probably my favourite part. And then very few vegetables accompanied which was too bad. Overall an ok experience, but nothing I would go back for."}
{"text":"Went here today for a late lunch/early dinner and service is superb. I have only been in this new location twice (one last year and one this year so far) and its been pretty consistent. I like the servers we get so customer service is good. Their SO MUCH BETTER than the ones we had previous years ago at their old location in square one. 

Noise level is okay so it wasn't too loud when we came in.. we sat in the dining area and the seatings are comfy. Decor is nice but I prefer the lounge area better. 

The food is also okay, I got the lobster and shrimp linguini and my partner got some burger and sweet potato fries. Nothing mind blowing but its better than the other ones I tasted elsewhere which was blah. I would get it again in the future should I feel like having pasta.

Their alcoholic drinks are always great.. I meant you cant go wrong right?

I recommend going here. I'll come back again for sure.

BTW:
If your reading this on February they have a Valentine's menu so $60 for 2 people for a three course meal."}
{"text":"Worst customer service I've had in a long time. I was with a group of less than 10 colleagues. We got our first drinks and ordered our meals. Not only was I forgotten but the drinks( were not replenished at all. After everyone at my table had finished eating, I got up to find our absent waitress, Jennifer, and asked for my meal. I got an excuse about how busy it was. That would have been plausible if the inside dining room and lounge were packed,  but that was not the case.  So with dirty dishes and dirty glasses filling our table, my meal came. About 30 minutes before we left, our table was relieved of the plates but mutiple dirty glasses crowded the table. She had came around and asked quickly if anyone wanted dessert. Of course myself and son got missed. Again. Finally after 2 and a half hours of being there, bills were passed out and alas, I was stuck waiting to pay my portion. Not only had other guests gone home, but the lack of staff other then the cooks was astonishing. Again our waitress was no where to be found. I wandered to the front cranky, tired son in hand feeling very irritated and trying not to say anything only because I have a corporate title over my head. I was more then happy to pay for my food even with the terrible service. But did not tip. A tip is something earned through service. I will never go back to this Moxie's again and will make sure if another company event is in the works we avoid this place like the plague."}
{"text":"Hello, we went to Moxie's Pickering for New Years @11:30 for a bite...we sat at a booth near the bar, we were so Disappointed with the live Dj was playing. The music had such profanity (b..., f..., n....) every songs had those lyrics, couldn't believe my ears that Moxie's would allow such music. It was so loud you could hear this even in the dining room. 
This shows how much the management cares about their business."}
{"text":"I've been to this location and as usual it's always busy. Due to it be situated inside Fairview mall if you're coming here during peak dinner hours be sure to make a reservation.
Luckily for us, coming here after 8 we didn't have to wait. On certainly days, like all other Moxies locations, they've got their weekly specials, from half price bottles of wines on Wednesdays to G&T Fridays. 
Our server was lovely, efficient and attentive to our requests.
In terms of apps, their bruschetta, sushi cone wraps are quite popular.
The ambiance is clean, sleek with contemporary decor and this place is always bustling!"}
{"text":"2nd Wednesday in a row and we're back to moxies, only this time, it's a different location.  We both decided to head out to an early dinner to beat out the crowd. 
After being seated within a few minutes we came to an agreement to order a bottle of their Chilean Red cabernet sauvignon....half price bottles of wine baby lol!
for food since we ate quite a bit prior to, we opted for the Sweet chili chicken which was alright.

overall the wine, ambiance, and service was awesome!"}
{"text":"oooops forgot to finish up this review last week, however with that being said, Moxies at Farview Mall was among the initiative few years back when this mall decided to renovate and give itself a \"redesigned look\"

I like this location is its convenient for those making it back from DT right after work, and at times the long subway ride can muster up your hunger.  Just a few minutes from Don Mills Station, thankfully (depending on your timing) you can actually beat the dinner crowd and get your table of choice.  However I played it safe and decided to book a reservation.  
Clean, contemporary, and not tooo too dim this restaurant has a beat ;) 
Their service (like most Moxie's franchises) is fast, friendly, and most of all efficient.

For appetizers I had their bruschetta, which had the usual works, but really, Im a sucker for boccocini lol  The only drawback was their crostini was a bit hard.  overall 3/5

for mains...Holding off the hunger games I was suffering, a good ol \"loaded backyard burger\" cured me; two types of cheese, mushrooms, and bacon!! with a drizzle of bbq sauce, it was juicy, tender, scrumptous, heart-warming, mezmorizing, love-at-first-bite great!!!! served alongside with their homecut fries which complimented this dish!! 4.5/5 in my books!

For drinks, I decided to have their glass of red.
Overall great food, service, taste, and presentation was delish!!!!"}
{"text":"damn! Thought I did a review for this place, guess not! 
Back in January along the stretch of Willowdale, Moxies at the time seemed to tbe the go to place.  Though a busy area, on a Saturday night I was able to find parking along Yonge.  

Upon arrival the main entrance via goodlife (smart and not-so-smart) you can't help but smell the chlorine which can be a deterrant.  However luckly we were able to walk right in rather than waiting out in the open air. It took a few minutes to find someone to seat us down. 

The restaurant is very spacious, clean, and comfortable. The service, unfortunately was not up to my standards.  There were times where the place seemed short staffed.  For food we ordered their Mosiac Dip; which was delicious, goat cheese, mushrooms served with a lightly toasted flat bread.  In addition we ordered calamari which was NOT BAD, however I still feel Bar Vespa in Liberty Village makes the best ;) 
Presentation of the food was at par with most casual restuarants, price was affordable, however it all comes down to the service, which was unfortunately slow :("}
{"text":"Coming here last week Wednesday! mental note; Every Wednesday you get to enjoy Half priced bottles of wine! my rule of thumb is food is for the soul, but wine is for the heart :) 
We both came here around 8pm, and luckily it was not too busy at the time as we were both able to get a seat in the lounge area.  
For drinks we ordered their Austrailian Penfolds which was a lovely full bodied wine! 
For food we decided to do it TAPAS style and order a bunch of appetizers to share.  We ordered their Spinach cheese dip that was served with flatbread (4/5) Seafood Calamari (3.5/5) and their sweet chicken (3.5/5) overall presentation was 5/5, the food was an average 4/5 and our server, JESS was LOVELY! 6/5 lol! the atmosphere was great and chilled out. 
Defintely will be back....next wednesday unless we decide to try a different Moxies location."}
{"text":"Went Tuesday to purchase $500.00 in promotional gift cards for xmas.Was told the promotion was over still 11 days to clad. It must have been on for 2 days or it was just a gimmick to get you in. Was there last year and not impressed."}
{"text":"I will give this restaurant one star. Even that is too many but I can't post this without committing to at least one. Coupons given in compensation of a horrible first experience brought us back for a second try. It seems these folks haven't learned a thing. We sat for 15 mins before anyone even acknowledged us. Only then did a bar manager stop by and ask if we had been looked after. We said we were leaving! She convinced us to stay promising she would personally serve us. We waited 12 mins for our first drinks, and 35 mins passed before we were offered a second. My dates fish was burnt and it took 15 mins for a replacement to arrive. I ate alone; he ate alone. Mood killer. We will never be back."}
{"text":"I was staying in the Sandman hotel, so Moxie's was right downstairs, and it was definitely better than your average in-hotel-lobby restaurant.  I ate there twice, and props for the kitchen being open until Midnight on a weeknight!  I had an AAA steak sandwich, and I was (happily) surprised that it was an actual well-cooked piece of steak on a half-baguette instead of the slices of meat that \"steak sandwich\" usually connotes to me.  The next time I had a chicken caesar salad which was perfectly fine.  We split a nice bottle of Cotes du Rhone and had a good caramel-ly bread pudding for dessert.

A strange thing about the restaurant is that seats in the booths seem very low (or the tables are very high) so you feel like you're eating with super-high elbows.  You know the feeling when you're trying to tie your own bow tie in the mirror and can't quite get it for 5 minutes and you get all frustrated and tense and your arms hurt?  It's a little bit like that when you eat in the booths here.  I know that's a super-strange comment to make, but for some reason it stuck in my head after eating here..."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to check this place out for a while now. I pass it every time I am shopping at Square One. I had lunch there on Sunday afternoon. I was there around 1:00pm and they were serving either brunch or lunch, no dinner menu available. We shared the Med Bread Trio, which was very tasty. I decided on the fish tacos. They were delicious. I would have them again. The service was fantastic. My drink was refilled before I even had to ask. Our waitress was very friendly and speedy. But maybe this is because it was Sunday and it was relatively early in the day. I had no complaints with the service. The washrooms were very clean as was the rest of the restaurant. I will come back here again."}
{"text":"I didn't write a review for this place?! Seems like I've been goin slow withh my reviews.. no worries updatttin now... 

My girlfriends and I tend to always come here since its the closest restaurant with ok quality...

Love the patio during the summer months but it can be packed allll da time..

We don't get enough hot weather here...the appetizers r always yummy here...we always tend to order the spinach dip and nachos...Hmm...so yummy!

the mains here are an A-OK..nothing that really screams \"this is so delicious\"...I like the environment and the service...they tend to come check up on us quite often to see how we are doing..

All in all, one of the places I would come due to proximity and ok service..=D"}
{"text":"Visited this Moxie's location for the first time, after some fun filled mini putting in celebration of my sister's birthday.
The menu is decently sized with quite a few options to choose.
The prices are on a bit of a steep side but Moxie's being a ''nicer' restaurant it's not unusual.

I got the chicken quesadilla which came with a salad and corn chips.
My husband and I also shared the Bruschetta.
The food was okay, really nothing to brag home about.
The quesadilla was on the burnt hard side and the corn chips had no flavour whatsoever.
Our bruschetta was pretty good save for the HUNKs of feta on each piece.. that's right.. HUNKS, not small crumbly pieces that you normally see on bruschetta. 

Service was lack luster, we waited for our food for almost an hour after ordering.
The waitress forgot my sister's drink order, she had to ask twice.
This visit was.. Eh.. okay nothing special.

The only reason I give 3 stars is because the washrooms are fantastic! Huge fancy stalls, big mirrors, even a sitting area to touch up your makeup.. redeeming factor.

3/5"}
{"text":"Service is terrible. I can't even express how disrespectful they are for not treating a customer that used to come every week. What a shame."}
{"text":"45 minutes to be acknowledged at the bar

Front of the House managers don't look like they know what to do.

I'm not sure where all the good reviews are coming from. Perhaps it's the dining room. 

I'm not a fan of paying top dollar for mediocre food and service. Maybe it's just the \"fine casual\" type restaurants."}
{"text":"I ordered the fish tacos (which comes with fries) for $15. Honestly the tacos were pretty average (not bad but nothing special either). I was a little bit surprised that I only got 2 tacos, considering the fact that this costed $15."}
{"text":"Think of a high class hooters with good food."}
{"text":"I went on a date here on Sunday night and I was in immediate awe of how beautiful this restaurant is.  The decor, the lighting, the furniture, and all the accents had me looking around and catching something new every time I shifted my eyes.   The lights were a little dimmer than I prefer but I guess that's supposed to compliment the ambiance.  

The restaurant wasn't busy at all so we were seated very quickly and our server promptly approached us.  He went over the menu and left giving us time to decide on drinks.  We settled on just water to start and the Honey Garlic wings for an app.  I read through the menu a first time taking in pretty much everything that was written describing each dish however nothing was immediately appetizing.  I gave the menu a few more glance overs and finally settled on the Shrimp Linguine, an unusual choice for me as I never order pasta in a restaurant.   My date kept it simple with The Burger and fries.   The wings took no time to come out and while I didn't love them, I didn't hate them like my date did.  The wings are a bit on the smaller size but very crispy which I actually like, however there is nothing honey garlic about this flavor.  Yes, the flavor itself is good but it is NOT honey garlic. I didn't mind the wings, he hated them. 

The Shrimp Linguine is served with half a baby lobster tail in a tomato sauce and is beautifully plated and presented.  It's a shame that this is where its awe factor ends.  We eat with our eyes first and since it looks so beautiful on the plate I took that first bite expecting to be wowed.   I wasn't.  The dish was completely bland and lacked any flavor.  I had to season it heavily with salt and pepper at least 3 times before it tasted like something.   Once I did adjust the seasoning it was just an ok dish.  The only pretty good thing was the portion size since I only managed about half of it at dinner I had the rest for lunch the next day.

As I mentioned, he kept it simple with The Burger and fries and unfortunately hated both.  In all fairness I should mention that he is a picky eater.  Having said this though based on this meal he did state this is the one and only time he would be at Moxies. I tasted only the fries and they were ok, really nothing special.  I didn't try the burger but I have to imagine it must be really bad when a big dude leaves literally three quarters of it uneaten.

We each had a bellini and could not figure out why in the world they throw a frog looking thing right on top of the drink!  It's edible but tastes awful and by the time we got to the bottom of our drink the frog was deformed and looked like just a clump of melted wax in the bottom of the glass.  Please stop ruining a fine drink with this ridiculous thing.  

I've always loved the white chocolate brownie not only because it's so tasty but because it gives me nostalgia as it takes me back to the days when I used to go to Moxies almost every weekend with my girlfriends in high school.  I was excited to introduce him to one of my favorite desserts since it was his very first time at Moxies but after how disappointed he was with his meal I couldn't even bring myself to suggesting it to him.

The restaurant itself is gorgeous but the food doesn't quite measure up.  We were pretty disappointed and for this reason our future dates probably won't be at Moxies."}
{"text":"Came with my girlfriend and one of her friends. The restaurant is inside the shopping mall and downstairs. Anyways, we were waiting outside for her friend to show up and one of the guys downstairs must have seen us so he came up and told us that if we came in, we could get a free dessert for each of us. We told him we were going to be coming in anyways but were just waiting for her friend to show up so he ended up giving us 3 dessert coupons. So when the group was finally ready, we got in and quickly got a table because it was a Tuesday night. I ended up getting a burger while my girlfriend got a pasta. Service was decent. Decor was ok. Food was ok. Nothing to brag about here but nothing really to complain. You'll get your mix of American food with some Italian dishes. The dessert was free which was even better but again, it was nothing to brag about."}
{"text":"After work (or after downtown crawling for me!) place to chill before heading home.  Sat in the patio which even though faces the parking lot, they have made an effort to make it look nice with colourful flowers, nice benches and pretty decent table/chair set up.  

Just had drinks here but they have drink specials so today was $5 peach bellinis.  The server was really friendly and checked in with us in a regular basis which is nice.  

Inside is that dark and cosy vibe with lots of booths.  Definitely a great place for dates or just hanging with friends and people watching.  Oh the characters and stories you can make up just by looking around here!"}
{"text":"Have eaten there about six or seven times, and as an American, I still cringe at the prices that Canadians pay for food and liquor. The food is good and creative, portions are not large.
I all ways set in the bar area or on a nice day on the patio and service has been OK
A couple of TV's for sports, friendly staff, would take you there if I knew you.
Just can't get over what my northern neighbors pay for a beer"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner.  Waited about 20 min which is not bad.  The restaurant is dimly lit and very noisy on a weekend so if you want somewhere quieter to talk to the people at your table..don't go here.  The server we had was very nice and apologized for the loud group we had beside us.  I wasn't very hungry so  I ordered 2 appetizers - the lettuce wrap and some sushi thing on taro chips.  The lettuce wrap with marinated chicken and Thai inspired flavours was actually pretty nice.  I would order it again.  It was a decent portion for an appetizer - to be honest for me that is probably enough for a whole meal with probably a little small side.  The lettuce give the dish a nice crisp, fresh taste.  Now the other...thing...I ordered...well..it was pretty tasteless...even with the sesame ginger dressing.  Very disappointed with that one.  You get 4 pieces but one was enough for me.  Do yourself a favour and don't order it.  One person ordered the nachos as an appetizer...it was one of the biggest plates of nach I have ever seen.  It was ok...most of the cheese had melted..but it felt like the ingredients were just umped on top of the chips..nothing really melt-y and gooey per say.  The steak my dad had (medium) was pretty decent he said,.,and he has high steak standards!  Overall not bad place but not really a first choice for a dining experience."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I've had enough of Moxie's. We were there June 2nd 2018' at 5p.m. for a party of 10. We had booked the Round Table at the far corner of the restaurant for a birthday dinner. We had all started ordering our drinks... I ordered a bottle of Prosecco, the server brought out the eight glasses before even checking to see if the Prosecco was available. After placing all eight glasses on the table, she went to get the Prosecco, only to return about 15 minutes later to inform us that the Prosecco was sold out. She offered me the Veuve Clicquot and indicated it was a higher end 'Prosecco' (hand gesture and all) so I explained to the server that it was not Prosecco, it was French champagne (I would not pay $175 for 1 bottle of champagne that's generally about $75 in the LCBO.) I proceeded to order two bottles of Rose. The server brought the bottles and placed them directly on the table, so I asked if there were any ice buckets with ice for them. She looked confused for a moment, then said yes...
I stated that she could leave the Rose in the buckets and we would open it later when more people arrived. I hoped that within 20 minutes it would be fairly chilled. She disappeared for about 20-30 minutes and a few more guests arrived. We ordered more drinks and generally chatted.
It was about 6:30 so we decided to order appetizers. As most people had arrived, the waitress began to take our appetizer orders and looked over to two of my friends having a difficult time figuring out what they wanted to order as an appetizer... her entire body language spoke volumes. She slumped her stance, dropped her shoulder... lifted her head and rolled her eyes. I intervened, and ask her if she could give them a few minutes. My friend quickly put in his order as he noticed her behaviour and she quickly made an escape from our table. A relief for me, as I began to feel incredibly uncomfortable.
The appetizers were beautiful in presentation and tasted exceptional. At this time I asked her to serve the Rose, she asked how many glasses and I stated six. My friend at this time asked her for an order of the Mosaic dip, she disappeared. I ate my appetizer and drank the water that I was provided. I was finished my appetizer and my water and sat for about 10 minutes looking around for the waitress who was no where to be seen... at this time I called the hostess in the restaurant via my cellphone and ask her if we could possibly have another server, something I have never done in my entire dining history. At this time the server came to our table and I explained that I had asked her to pour the rose and she didn't, she just left. I explained to her that I would like another server. She ran off and got the manager, who I explained the situation to and indicated all I expected was some basic customer service. He was very protective of her and stated that she may have misheard or not heard me. I explained that she heard enough of my conversation to ask me how many glasses and then disappeared from the table. And I also explain to him that I spoke to her directly about my concerns. He did his best with the situation, and offered to pour the wine for us, which was a nice gesture. And he even took one of the wine bottles off our bill. Incredibly professional individual.
We had a new server after that and it was a far better experience, our glasses of water was refilled(as they had been empty since our appetizers) our orders were taken and we felt like people. The entire ambience changed, everyone was interacting and laughing. She engaged in conversation, we ordered more wine with our meals and just had an amazing time. She was well deserving of her tip as she made a bad experience amazing. 
Another manager with a beard came to our table and made the situation worse, providing a bullshit lie about him running to the wine store to get wine for us, when the wine was sitting on the table for an 1.5 to 2hrs... I could also see him patting her on the shoulder while they were standing at the wall chatting. Waste of time and fake empathy that is easily seen through... as he acted like the server was the victim.
We are terribly sorry we inconvenienced your server with our orders. What a joke... She is an unprofessional server, but these guys enable her ineptitude. 
The 2nd server was 100 times better than her in every aspect.
A very unfortunate experience, especially since we've been going to this Moxie's for many years... it was our favorite haunt when we 1st started dating. But sentimentality aside, if no improvements are made, it is easy to move on.
They even messed up my steak, I had ordered medium rare and I got medium well... not impressed. But after that waitress, I dealt with the poor steak quality happily as it at least wasn't raw."}
{"text":"This was my 2nd visit to this location over a year period ....
Came here on a Saturday evening with a few friends , the place was surprisingly empty ,both dining area and bar .
We walked in wanting to sit at the bar .
Waiting no hostess to help so we seat our selves.
We waited a good 10 to 15 minuets to get served 
As we watched the bartender and manager and waitress just walk around and chit chat .
That impressed me ! But hey maybe that's the moxies philosophy ignore customers .
Anyways we finally got to order our drinks had one and left as we didn't feel welcome .
There's many bars and restaurants in the area maybe try one of them is my suggestion !"}
{"text":"I called around 6:25pm the first receptionist picked up and I told her if we could make a reservation for 4 people at 7pm, she said she would put me on hold for a moment. I was on hold for 4 minutes and I hung up. So I called again another lady picked up saying they dont take reservation after 6pm, walk in only. I was wondering the first girl could have just told me no reservation rather she put me on hold. 

We showed up at the restaurant at 6:45pm. We were offered to be seated in the lounge right away- that was pretty awesome. 

The services were just MEHHHHH...
The portions were pretty small compared to before. I finished my shrimp linguine and I was still hungry....compare to before I couldnt finish the entire dish and I had to pack them to go. 

My hubby ordered a \"Loaded burger\" he finished it in 5 minutes and he was still hungry as well...

My friends and myself love Moxie's white chocolate brownie....by far the best brownie ever in town....the dessert was super delicious....

We would come back again for the white chocolate brownie only NOT for any of their meals....."}
{"text":"It's patio season again!  The patio is probably the best thing about this Moxie's.  The service was slow, but I thought it was because of the heat, apparently it's just slow at this location.

The food is ok.  Personally I just really like the avocado spring rolls, and the ones here were good."}
{"text":"We were here last night (a group of 6).  They seated us in a reasonable amount of time (we waited about 10 minutes or so).

If the review was based on food alone, I'd probably go up to 4 stars.

Food:
Avocado spring rolls - are soooo tasty
Tuna Tartare - another winner
(I'd probably give their apps 5 stars)

Mediterranean veggie burger - yummy
The enchiladas - also really tasty
Shanghai noodles - surprisingly good
Steak - over cooked (ordered medium, it came out medium well)
Ribs - another winner

Service - super crazy slow, and they had problems with the terminal and were unable to print our bill.  So a meal that started at 7:45, ended after 11 - not bad for a Canoe or something, not so good for chain.

It seems many of the restaurants today, can't seem to handle larger groups.  (Second one this week)..."}
{"text":"B - List. Good food - check. Good location - check, Funky, trendy music in background - check. Comfortable, relaxing and darkish dining interior - check. Bar on the other side with a bazillion screens  - check. Young energetic staff albeit very short on fabric - check. What You Would Expect To Pay For All of The Above - check. Kinda like an Earls wannabe. Have fun here but know there is much better not far from here:)"}

McDonalds has a better BLT Bagel, if your going to charge $13.00 for just BLT sandwich, no fries included, make it a good hearty sandwich with good bacon, it only had 3 skimpy pieces of bacon and mainly all fat, hardly no lettuce or tomatoe I should of really not paid for it at all, highway robbery!! Won't be back"}
{"text":"I have been to this Moxie's a few times. Lately I've been finding the food here disappointing. On my last visit I had the chopped Asian chicken salad. Truthfully, a salad from Wendy's would have been more satisfying and cost me half the price. I suspect I just keep ordering the wrong things here as my dining companions are usually satisfied. The one bonus to this location is the heated patio with lots of light."}
{"text":"2 Stars goes to dinner service at Moxies, 4 Stars if you only go for drinks in the lounge with good company... so I'll give an average of 3 stars.

PROS:
It's a good place for late night gatherings, watching sports games, or just having fun with your friends. Their drink list is elaborate and I've always been a fan of Margarita Tuesdays and Bellini Wednesdays! Prices aren't exactly cheap, but they are worth trying. The ambience is modernized with light fixtures and comfy booths and chairs.

CONS: 
If you go for dinner, do not be surprised if your waitress does not come by for at least 10 minutes, and then disappear for another 10 minutes before you even get a glass of water. My order was mixed up for a dinner size meal instead of an appy and I had specifically pointed on the menu which item I had selected. I had not known until my bill showed up and how was I supposed to know the size differences? It was my first time eating the dish. I've made modifications to my menu item on another occasion and they did make any effort to change it. 

I'll stick with the drinks.... you should too."}
{"text":"Conveniently located in the North York area, very nice decor, average service, good menu selection, direct access to parking lot, direct access into the mall.  I've been here twice, once for a mid-week lunch with coworkers and once  when I was in Toronto with family on a weekend for lunch.  For the most part, our meals were good (not great) and the atmosphere was comfortable - not too loud.  Nachos are HUGE, so if you have a group of 3 or more, I definitely recommend the nachos.  I just wish the salsa was real....guess I'll have to wait to get back home to SoCal to get real salsa.....mmmmm salsa...."}
{"text":"Took my mother in law for lunch and it was very nice. Hadn't been to a moxies in a while but it was really good. Decent menu, good house red wine, big nice restaurant. Saturday brunch went till like 3pm!  But we went with the salmon Cobb salad and a burger. Also started with calamari. I have nothing bad today. Service and food were excellent."}
{"text":"Very impressed!  Spent a full day on the slopes.  I just wanted to sit down, and enjoy some good food.  I was afraid that showing up in my ski attire would get us sent elsewhere, but the service was exceptional and the food was even better.  I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner around 8pm on a Wednesday night - it was packed! I've been to Moxies before, at Hwy7 and Leslie, but I think this one was better. It was packed - there's a dining area and a lounge area, the lounge area is louder and i believe it's 19+ because of le booooze. We sat in the dining area, spacious and tons of space - the booths were super comfortable. 

I had the loaded backyard burger. It was great - mushrooms, tons of cheese, lettuce, onions, tomato and BACON. yummy crunchy delicious bacon. It was better than average burger, but definitely not the best. The meat was dry-ish and I really didn't like the bun. The top is very glossy and i had to peel it off, not my style. Fries were standard - thick cut, crispy and fresh. I ordered the basil mayo which was a great idea - it's delicious!!! Definitely trying this at home.

My friend had the chicken enchiladas, of which i had one and some salsa and guacamole. The enchiladas were OK, kind of slimy and too bready? The sauce was a bit slippery, not sure how to explain it but it kind of reminded me of a creamy version of cheese whiz. There were tortilla chips all around, with sour cream and salsa. Those were both ok, salsa wasn't too flavourful or spicy - just bearable. But the guac. OMG THE GUAC IS HORRIBLE!!!!! It has the texture of toothpaste, it tasted disgusting. For the first time in my life, I was disappointed in guac. I don't know what they did to it but for the love of all things food - stop doing it. YUCK.

We also got sweet potato fries and they come with two sauces - one is chipotle and one is curry based (i think, at least that's what it tasted like). The sauces were ok, the fries were a bit soggy and not crunchy at all. Kind of disappointed?

The service was great, he was quick and sweet and just generally very nice, not overpowering. I think his name was Dustin.....but who know, I suck at names. 

If you don't have good dinner ideas I would suggest this place, it's standard, no hassle and pretty good portions. But DO NOT ORDER THE GUACAMOLE. Unless you want to embark on a toothpasty adventure.... eek."}
{"text":"Went for dessert and coffee. Had the white chocolate Brownie(usually my favourite ).I was very disappointed. Seems as though there are so many changes to the menu. Why fix something that is already so good. Moxies has no now been cut out of my go to restaurants. Will not  be returning any time soon."}
{"text":"Very hip and fun place - go there all the time when I'm staying at Pearson airport. 
Excellent menu particularly for vegetarians (no worries meatetarians you're well taken care of). Check out the starters: cauliflower gets a solid 10, the guacamole is right up there too (and I'm from Texas), lettuce wraps pretty good, hear the tuna is also worthy of a try. As it relates to the beer: you're in Canada, need I say more?"}
{"text":"I love moxie's, not this location though. Service here is very-very slow, and food is below average so as their cocktails. 
If you really want to go Moxie's try Dundas or yorkdale locations (yorkdale is the best so far)."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this location. The staff is terrific and I'm always satisfied whenever I come here. Steak salad, Moxies G&T, salted pecan cheesecake, great way to kick off a weekend"}
{"text":"First time. Above average food.Good atmosphere. 3.5 stars is about right. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"It was our first time trying moxie's, we usually have dinner at the keg. The service is fast even though the place was crowded,the waiter was sweet and helped us pick.
I had mango chipotle chicken,it was perfect but the quinoa was rather tasteless.
My husband had a steak,it was delicious.
Their chicken pasta was to die for.
Dad had some sort of breaded chicken with goat cheese,said it was oversalted. 
Best part was the calamari appetizer,that was wonderful."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner!
The 4 of us all had a great dinner. Was a little worried as it was not busy for a Saturday night, but service was good and so was dinner. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Portion could be better, a bowl of soup gets a 2/3 bowl. The portion for the 4 of us was less then adequate for the price. The side of ketchup had a film on it and was not fresh. The waitress was nice and attentive. Water refills were
Very good."}
{"text":"Came to Canada for a vacation (from US). Surprisingly Moxie's was very tasty! I got the broccoli cheddar soup and chicken enchiladas and they were so good! Our server was very prompt and quick, there was a slight mistake from the kitchen on one of our friends' food but they were quick to fix it and took care of the price of her meal and added a free salad. Not sure why Moxie's has bad reviews on Yelp though. I like the atmosphere and modern decor. I'd highly recommend."}
{"text":"The service was friendly. The food was good. The daily drink deals was a nice touch. Unfortunately, cleanliness is an issue. The menu, table, seat and bathroom were messy. Table was cleared but was sticky. I was hesitant to touch the dirty menu."}
{"text":"I've eaten here probably Ten times and the service is a little spotty, some good some bad. The menu is good and the prices are to be expected considering the type of restaurant. I gave only 3 stars because I had breakfast here once and it was horrible.  But it's a 3 or 4 restaurant depending on the server and what you choose.  Best thing on the menu is the tuna sushi!  I wouldn't come here for breakfast again!"}
{"text":"Rough night at Moxies.  Three of us went there after work. We ordered a bottle of Barolo and after getting our salads, the wine had still not shown up. Finally the waiter came by and said they could not find the wine...so i ordered a different bottle. Five minutes later, he shows up with the original choice.  Of course, our food had already come to the table. We all had the Sirloin with Prawn sauce. Decent but not great. 

Bottom line: Moxies is about the people watching but for the prices, it should be better."}
{"text":"Went here for drinks and a bit of food tonight. It wasn't bad. Food is pricey, especially for what you get. Burger and sweet potato fries, that were pretty lifeless, $18. Our server tried to up sell everything!

\"Did you want vodka, gin, or Grey Goose?\"
\"Adding sweet potato fries is $3 but if you order it as an appetizer its $7.\"
\"Would you like all your drinks Moxie sized?\"
\"Get the bacon burger, there's bacon on it and it's just a few bucks more.\"
\"Get guac on your nachos, it's just a buck.\"

I get it, you're pretty clever and you wanna sell more because that means bigger tip but if you do it in a way where service is dismal and all we hear you say is spend more money, it makes me want to do the exact opposite and get the hell out. Unfortunately I was in a group of 8 and all of the rest were too lazy to leave. A smile from our server would've helped. His face read \"fuck my life.\" and it just dampened the mood for everyone.

Food quality is okay. Nothing spectacular, but for the price I would appreciate it if the food actually tasted good and not just put on a fancy square plate with small metal ramekins for ketchup.. Drinks here a good, strong, and reasonably priced. 

Overall, come here for the bar. Lots of T.V.s and the bartenders are nice. The bathrooms here are pretty swanky and have fireplaces. Next time I come here I am eating beforehand and only staying in the bar area."}
{"text":"Food was decent, recommended: haddock with quinoa, chipotle mango chicken, steak sandwich. Everything steak and chicken are safe choices, the chicken is surprisingly tender and flavourful.

Avoid - lobster as it's oversalted and not very fresh. Sweet potato fries are pretty oily and soft and not very fry-tasting

Portions - are huge so it's pretty worth the money. Appetizers are nothing too special (we had sushi cones and bruschetta) and they're okay to skip since mains are huge.

Atmosphere - came here on a weekday for lunch and it was really popular among professionals who work in the area. The seating is still really nice though, not too crowded

Service - pretty good and attentive without being overwhelming"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was really nice. The food was ok.  The issue was three of the four items I ordered were wrong.  If they get the order right they may get four stars. But they did comp my appetizer"}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Saturday night, and sat in the lounge. Service was good, and the place was beautifully decorated
Food: 
1. Salmon Banh mi: new menu item, salmon on Italian bread, with caramelized onions and cucumber. Served with fries. 3.5/5, the bread was not toasted enough, and was sogged up a bit by the dressing
2. Chicken Alfredo penne: 3.5/5 overall it was good, but nothing really stood out to have you coming back for this dish. 

Price: 
Banh mi 16.00- way to pricey for the portion size 
Alfredo 17.00- also a bit over price 

Overall, I'll come back for the atmosphere, location, and decent food."}
{"text":"I ordered steaks and baked potatoes. My med steaks was more like well done and bake potato was cold. And asparagus was looking very sad. Definitely not worth for $40 meal. My server was sweet and she apologized and get attention from floor manager. He said my asparagus was how they cook. U gotta b kidding. But he gladly changed my steaks and it was blue this time. Not rare almost uncooked BLUE.
They don't know how to cook and managed. Just good location. Don't go here!!"}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants but this particular one has nice venues and their staff are usually friendly. This location is new and not very busy yet, nonetheless, they live up to their standards."}

{"text":"This place was amazing! Definitely order the sushi cones as the app and the The GT drink was amazing! Great atmosphere in the bar area! Craving the sushi cones already the next morning!"}
{"text":"Food was good, however, service sucks. Especially the front desk girl with skimpy dress was very snobbish."}
{"text":"Awful experience! Very poor service. They dont listen to you. Brought us water after our meals were served. When asked for water, they got us empty glasses and asked if we wanted it in a glass. Weird people.
Food was below expectations and pasta was half cooked. 
Our starters were served along with the food. Wtf man they were starters! 
All because the cheesecake factory wait times were killing!"}
{"text":"I recently decided to check this place out. They used to be in another section of the mall (Square One) before the recent renovation, so I don't know what they were like in that location. Their new location near the new mall entrance is quite upscale though.

Along with the upscale atmosphere is a correspondingly premium level of price, selection, and service. First off, you could spend $40-50 on just yourself including drink, appetizer, main course, and tip (I didn't even order coffee or dessert). It's not the most expensive, but it's up there. I would probably put it on par with Milestones or possibly The Keg. The eclectic makeup of the menu reminded me of Milestones.

All in all, I would characterize Moxie's as a somewhat upscale chain restaurant with the feel of a wine bar and a menu with some interesting culinary creations from all over."}
{"text":"Dropped by Moxie's with intention of eating but ended up just having a couple drinks instead. As the weather was beautiful we opted for the Patio. The Patio at the Moxie's on Southport Road is quite small and feels a bit enclosed, I personally prefer my patios feeling more open and inviting, still any patio is generally better than no patio. Also nothing much around here for a scenic view being next to the Superstore and Macleod Trail. 

One thing I like about Moxie's is they usually do a good job offering a nice seasonal menu, Stampede time was no exception and they had a few good options with a Stampede theme to choose. The effort on the décor side was less impressive as they basically just added cowboy hats to the coat hangers lol... Our server did a good job, he was professional and quick with our orders. Prices were high but on par with restaurants in this category. Drinks were tasty and refreshing for the warm day. That's about it for this one, just another Moxie's at the end of the day; probably on par with most Moxie's experiences, just okay. I think my biggest problem with the Moxie's chain is they really haven't evolved, they felt modern and trendy about 5-10 years ago when they did their last facelift, but really haven't done much to evolve themselves since then."}
{"text":"So I had my birthday here and it was really awesome. We were a party of 12 and the service was great. I always love the food here so I was a little disappointed with my pasta and salmon (I think..) The ambiance is great including the decor and music. The best part was the dessert: white chocolate brownie! Yummy!! definately worth it! I think it's much better to share it because it can get overpowering..love Moxies!!"}
{"text":"Went to Moxies with a few girlfriends after work recently, sort of unintentionally. We were supposed to go to another restaurant at Yorkdale, but only found out once we got there that it had closed down. We decided to check out Moxies because one of the girls in our group had been there before and said it was good. 

It's tucked inside the mall on the lower level, so it's quite dark in there. It felt a bit strange, especially when we left, because it was a beautiful, sunny day. 

We all had a Bellini and then shared an appetizer before our dinner. You really can't go wrong with a Bellini here. Love that peach slush! 

We shared the Mosaic dip with pita bread and tortilla chips. It was better than expected. I had the lettuce bun burger with added bacon and cheese and a side of yam fries. Everything was really good. 

Our server was super friendly and was able to split the appetizer between four bills with no issues. I wish every restaurant could figure this out! 

Moxies is honestly not my first choice when it comes to dining out, especially not this basement location, but it was a pretty decent back-up plan."}
{"text":"I sat in the lounge area and ordered one of the summer drink specials (pointed out by the hostess, actually) - the Big Life Radler (or so I thought), followed by an appetizer (tuna poke in a jar) and main course of fish tacos. 

My brother worked as a chef at Moxies a number of years ago in BC and I always enjoyed the food there. I don't know if the entire chain has taken a nose dive, but this location is seriously in need of a shake-up or something. 

Service was mediocre - the server brought me the wrong drink, which I didn't realize until I got the bill, and then she came up with a bunch of excuses as to why she didn't understand what I had asked for. I was very clear when I asked for the \"Big Life Radler\" which is on their summer drink special menu for $5 Sun-Thu. She brought me a Radler (in a can) with a glass that said \"Big Life\" on it. I didn't realize it wasn't the drink I'd ordered, because I didn't pay attention to what was on the can, just the big letters on the glass. How would I know? I'm from Vancouver and not familiar with locals brews. 

It wasn't a problem, until she went to explain to the manager, who came over and proceeded to explain to me that I wouldn't have actually liked the drink special because it had (gasp!) BEER in it. Well, where I come from, that's what a Radler is. Beer with citrus fruit in it. Anyway, I felt he was extremely condescending to me in trying to say what I ordered was shitty and I wouldn't have enjoyed it, so they basically saved me from having a terrible beer drink. Of course, anyone who knows me, knows I love beer, so I was chuckling to myself while he stood there and explained to me the difference between what I had and what a \"real\" Radler is. 

It wasn't just the service, but also the food. The fish tacos were so bland and boring, I had to put salt on it - which couldn't even save them. I only ate one and just ate the fish off the other two. The waitress did her best to ignore this when she cleared the plates, and didn't ask if I wanted dessert, either. Ironically enough, I went there specifically to have the berry pavlova, which I didn't get to try after all. 

There are enough restaurants in this city (and this area) for me to try that I have no desire to go back to a crappy one where the management talks down to the customer over an issue that was clearly the server's mistake. No wonder this place was almost empty. Moxies, get your shit together or I can see this location closing very soon."}
{"text":"There were 8 of us and we had a reservation, so Moxie's knew we were coming. Yet it took 1/2 hour for some of us to get our drinks and a long time for the orders to be taken and the meal served. And then it was cold. I had steak and mashed potatoes in the potato skin and a veggie. All cold and the steak, which I asked to be well done was red in the middle. Friends on either side of me said their meal was cold as well and one person didn't get the side she had ordered. If they can't get enough staff, maybe they should shut down part of the restaurant."}
{"text":"We had a fairly large group for dinner.  Our server was confused when one of my colleagues ordered his drink \"up\" - a fairly common bar term I think.  Two attempts later he switched to  beer.  My drink order was also messed up - received a sauvignon blanc instead of a cabernet sauvignon.  Overall decent food marred by subpar service on a slow Monday night."}
{"text":"Solid choice for date night.. Wicker furniture couches and heaters on patio. Solid drink specials. Solid apps. Different specials every day of the week. 

$5 pints tonight, $5 frozen white peach drinks. $4 tacos. 

No serious complaints here other than taking a star for whack beer selection. Also a fan of the Med Bread app"}
{"text":"Waited for food for 40 minutes and it turned out they just forgot about me. 
Thanks to management they at least haven't charged me for a dinner. 

Update: overall communication with managers was good. It was a bug in a computer system and little forgiveness from waiters side. But generally speaking restaurant was nice and food was tasty."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Saturday trip out to the mall.  We were seated fairly quickly and the waitresses were pretty attentive.  We were given the brunch menus to order from; I got the avocado/salmon toast and the portions were much smaller than I thought.  It was still kind of filling, but for the price tag... might've been better to just gone to the food court."}
{"text":"Whenever one of my friends mentions that we should go eat at Moxie's I am the first one to argue that we shouldn't. The reason being is that everything that I've ordered from the salmon, to the chicken, to the pasta have been very below average. The food was dry and didn't have that much flavour or taste to it, as well the price you pay for the amount of food you get is not worth it. 

However the service was very good, the staff were consistently on top of everything, from getting refills, to taking orders and any requests that we may have had. 

If you are just looking for a place to go after work and to enjoy a few drinks with some friends or just to get out of the house I would recommend it, but definetly do no go if your wanting to eat.

Items to definetly get:

NOTHING."}
{"text":"This is a review for the lounge only.  I've eaten here a few times weekday lunch and you can't beat it for timing.  The other pubs downtown are crazy busy and slooooooow at lunch.  Moxi's get's busy but they seem to have a system because you get your food and you're out in an hour.  Menu selection is the same as downstairs, service is a prompt and prices are fair.  Had this fish tacos this time which you can have grilled or fried, I went fried and fries (yes I was bad) and they were very tasty. Decent sized pieces of fish, tangy sauce, crunchy lettuce and fresh tacos.  Good portion of fries as I couldn't eat them all.  Good, quick lunch spot."}
{"text":"Dined with a relatively large group on a Monday night, the host was very friendly and took our orders very quickly. However it literally took an hour for all of our food to arrive. 
Our dishes were alright, but definitely not worth it for the price."}
{"text":"After a long day's work and a great dinner, this is a fun place to stop at to grab a drink and a lite snack.  

I happened to land myself at this place, based on the recommendation of my fellow co-worker who happened to be at the same place the night before for dinner.  

Now, I only had drinks at the bar and didn't have any of the food; however, according to him and another co-worker, the food was decent.  

A few observations:

1.  The drinks are great and they have nightly specials.
2.  They have HUGE tv's; so, if you want to catch up on sports, this is your place.
3.  The views are simply amazing (I'm not talking about the views out the window).

Great drinks, awesome service and the staff is...well...stop by and judge for yourself :-)"}
{"text":"Elegant decor, enthusiastic and friendly service, and great food. Located at the heart of a foodie plaza in Markham, Moxie's has been a local choice restaurant of mine for years when it comes to meeting up with friends for a nice evening. 

I come to catch a lot of Raptors games because the atmosphere is refined and yet bustling with excitement. 

Food:

- My choice appetizer is always the Bruschetta. Great taste and topped with goat cheese for that creamy texture. The only odd thing is that there are 7pcs ...but I nab the delicious odd piece with pleasure ;) 
- Their salads are my favourite choice mains. I love their steak salad (which also has goat cheese!) that is made with a mouthwatering salad dressing that is tarte, sweet, and had a kick! Another delicious green dish is their salmon cobb salad. Loaded with a perfectly cooked egg,
Bacon, medium rare salmon, and avacado, this salad will leave you very satisfied! 
- If you do choose one of the other mains, be sure
To try their twice baker stuffed potato! 
- Who hasnt heard about the famous white chocolate brownie dessert? Do not finish any Moxie experience without this! 

Overall, I have and will continue to visit this Moxies location ;) just wanted to give the recognition I felt it deserves!"}
{"text":"White chocolate brownie with ice cream is the best dessert. I did not enjoy the other food, it's a bit over priced. I had the chicken with veggies. Overall, the service was good and staff were friendly. Just didn't like the food as much as I heard about it."}
{"text":"This was my second visit over the past year.  I confess to enjoying it more the first time although I can't for the life of me remember what I ordered.  I came for lunch again, but this time ordered a steak sandwich.  It was dull.  I guess I had it in my mind it would be something like a cheesesteak sandwich, but it was basically a thin slice of steak under-seasoned open faced on bread.  Meh.  Not sure this is worth a repeat visit."}
{"text":"Not sure why people give this restaurant 3 stars.  The Ginko Japanese tepenyaki Restaurant at the dowdy Doubletree Hotel gets three stars and this is far better than that.  

I visited for lunch with my wife and some friends.  We were not overly hungry and ordered appetizers and white cranberry cosmopolitans, a drink they are known for.  My wife loved her drink.  The tuna tartar was delicious although it had some sinew.  When we pointed this out to the server she called over the manager who comped the dish (the chef had responded that some sinew in tuna was normal!!!!!  Say what?  Maybe in Somalia.)    The pot stickers and flatbread were tasty, but the spring rolls were a bit overdone and bland.

The wait staff and hostess were young, attractive, attentive and dressed in tight black clothing which gives you a sense for the ambiance.

The decor is contemporary and upscale, which I tend to favor.

I would not hesitate to go back for a business lunch or a meal with friends."}
{"text":"Moxie has gone through so many transitions of menu and look throughout the decades which kinda makes me feel ummm young at heart. 

This location seems to change quite frequently from decor and menu. 

Pricing has crept up over the years but the quality and look has move up. 

Burgers  are tasty here as are the chicken fingers and soup. 

Staff are very friendly on restaurant and bar side. 

Overall lively atmosphere in bar and great place to meet with family and friends."}
{"text":"Mediocre food that's unseasoned,  and dry.   Service is slow as hell, prices are about double what the food is worth."}
{"text":"Amazing place for dinner especially if you're there with a large group. They accommodate everyone as well! They do get busy so making reservations would be advantageous especially on holidays or long weekends. They definitely accommodate vegetarians and those who was gluten free meals. The place is a little pricy but most of the food as well as the quality matches up to it. Recently
They have decreased the portions of everything such as the nachos! We used to get a hug round plate of nachos and now it's a small Rectangular plate. I did not like how the decreased the portion especially since it's a shareable appetizer. I usually just The appetizers and dessert at Moxie's. I get the double cheese nachos, The bruschetta and the white chocolate brownie. THE BROWNIE IS SO GOOOOOD!!! The nachos are just as good but can be oily sometimes! They got the best bruschettas! The servers are really nice and help you a lot! Food comes fairly fast and they are a very Clean as well as fancy Place! Overall,good time here!"}
{"text":"Arrived at 130pm for the patio.  It was not too packed. I found my spot by the patio with parking lot surrounding.  The music was perfect volume.  Gives you a patio party vibe.  However, the servers were not attentive enough.  I sat there over 10 minutes and nobody gave me a menu.  Once they acknowledge my presence, the server only gave me the food menu.  I wanted a drink too, so where is the drink menu?   Don't mention the wine menu cuz she forgot to bring it as well.   Ordered goose island for $6.  Good deal.  Ordered blackened chicken burger.  It was amazing.  The fries were soggy though.  Burger was pepperish which is fine by me, it was very tasty."}
{"text":"Apart from the dark modern ambience of a gentlemen's club this place has really nothing going for it. Drinks are overpriced, the food is really overpriced and it's not even very good.

Your much better off at Pickle Barrel or even Milestones for that matter."}
{"text":"Great food selection. Waitress/hostess was clumsy. She almost dropped her tray and some of our drinks fell but she gave us extra Smirnoff for free. She was confused in our orders and even until giving our separate bills, she was still doing it wrong.. The food was awesome, baby back ribs with the mashed potato really tastes amazing!! Bruschetta was very tasty too!"}
{"text":"Have been to this location a couple times, and a few things stand out:

1. The waitresses are all models. Finding flaws is next to impossible 
2. The location is great
3. They have a well stocked bar
4. The food is just ok. Which is probably why they have the ridiculously hot waitresses!

All humor aside, it's immediately recognizable why Moxies has gotten slammed for their hiring practices and for hiring the women they do, but the formula works. It's a busy, catchy atmosphere and the service is good. 

As far as the food goes, as I said it's not great, it's not terrible. I ordered a burger the first time and flatbread pizza the next, and I'd give preference to the burger. The pizza was kind of boring and light on toppings, but still good. Kudos to the second waitress who, on a dead Saturday at lunch time, was attentive and friendly and didn't keep our table wanting for anything.

Worth the trip. And not just for the models"}
{"text":"Moxie's just across the street from work so I go there quite often. Service is good and food isn't all too bad either! My favorite dish is the veal meatballs stuffed with bocconcini. 

This place is almost always crowded. It's perfect for large groups. They can accommodate dozens of people in a group. All you need to do is pre-order using a pretty little spreadsheet. 

Above all, I like to go there for a beer or two after work!"}
{"text":"Came here on multiple ocassions their steak is delicious, the best steak i had so far to date, the plate was gorgeous and everything from the steak to the grilled carrot and red peper slice they used was tasty! the drinks here are delicious as well and service has always been perfect!! couldn't have asked for faster, more attentive service both in the dinning room and bar area!! beautiful decor throughout the restaurant and their bathroom is also nice and modern including a confy couch area for freshning your make- up with a mirror lamp added on every seat!   will i go back? heck ya"}
{"text":"Ok I am completely biased to this location lol.  I usually come here on Friday's for the past 7 years and have come to know the managers and waitresses.  So hense the 5 star.  We get amazing service (but also we are regulars) .  

6 dollar double absolutes at night...can't be beat.   The GT specials...awesome and delicious.    The 3 dollar street taco's are pretty damn good.

IF you hate on the brownie, there is something wrong with you.

Now it is a chain, but i enjoy coming in with friends to kick back, have a few bevy's and relax.

The only thing i Miss are the Old med bread, the sampler platter, the old type of calmer, and avocado rolls .  But hey can't expect a menu to stay the same"}
{"text":"Great food, the blackened burger was good. The beer super great. The only thing I was disappointed in was they gave my kids juice in a glass cup. Think God she did not break it."}
{"text":"Moxie's makes up for it's good-ISH food with its drinks and service! I loved my Bloody Ceasar, and our waiter who was also the bar tender was charismatic and attentive. When I mentioned that the rice that came with my thai red curry was not jasmine rice, but actually undercooked sushi rice, the manager came over and apologized immediately, plus my friend and I each got a free shot from the bar tender. Wouldn't go back for the food, but definitely for the trendy atmosphere, amazing cocktails, and friendly staff! Keep it up Moxie's!"}
{"text":"Ordered wine and in one of the glasses there was stuff in it.  According to the waitress after 10 min it was \"just\" cork but no replacement was given and the glass didn't come back...Not that we would want to drink it!!  Service was super slow, never in my life did I get such slow service.  To bring over drinks apparently takes around half hour +.  We WOULD have ordered snacks but we wanted to catch a movie and didn't expect things to be so slow.  We tipped 30% hopefully to make a difference...It did not lol.  Well I wouldn't have tipped 30% personally but my friend wanted to.  Not impressed.  Not to mention it wasn't even busy!!!  Would never go back to this location.  I have been to other locations and none were at this standard."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday afternoon-- was fairly busy. We were seated promptly and our server, was very friendly. 

We both ordered steaks. The New York and the sirloin with mushroom for myself. The steaks were both cooked to our liking and the accompanying vegetables were great! The mushroom sauce on my sirloin was delicious. The baked potato could use a little more seasoning; however, the overall dishes were excellent."}
{"text":"Wanted to check out their brunch menu and my go to at any brunch places is usually the eggs Benedict. Let's just say i will not be ordering this here ever again!

The poached eggs were perfect but they were om top of a baguette...disappointing! 
The hashbrowns were fried cut potatoes...everyone know pan stirred is the best kind!

I'd definitely try a different brunch dish next time but not this"}
{"text":"Great server (jake?) with a good humor and a perfect professionalism. The food was just awesome (all of our plates). The cocktails were the best I had since a long time and the atmosphere was not too lousy. 
A really nice experience. Thank you."}
{"text":"Wings are mediocre. Oven roasted ribs were ok, I would probably not pay 20$ for that again. I've had the honey garlic steak, it was perfectly cooked the way I had requested. It was flavourful, although, I expected it to taste more like honey garlic.. It had an aggressive lemony taste. As for the service, I always see so many servers walking around yet mine just isn't there when I need her. The managers I've encountered there have exquisite customer serving skills. Drinks are great."}
{"text":"I've been to many Moxie's before with decent food and service, but the service at this particular Moxie could have been better. The location is convenient as it's just along Sheppard Walkway. 

My friends and I were looking for a place to grab dessert after dinner. One of my friends was craving the brownie at Moxie's particularly so we went. There were plenty of spots in the restaurant and we were seated right away. However, the service was just incredibly slow. It could've been because of the staffing, but if the restaurant is not particularly busy there is no reason for the service to be this slow. It's pretty bad when one of us had to get up just to get someone's attention and pay the bill. On top of that, the bills were mixed up of course. It's understandable if the restaurant is busy, but not if it's nearly empty. It was frustrating because when we were trying to get the waitress' attention she was talking to another table the entire time, and then when she was done, she was chatting up with another table longer. It was exhausting as many of us had work the next morning and it was getting late. It was also tempting to not tip at all but being the responsible citizens we are, we tipped at least 10%. 

On top of that, we had to deal with a drunk bartender which was not a pleasant experience. 

In all fairness, my friend said when she went the service wasn't that bad, so it could've been the hour we went. The food was fine because it is Moxie and a chain. Overall, I would give this review 2.5 stars"}
{"text":"It's a moxie's. This one has good service and it's a nice layout being connected to the hotel. It's the moxie's closest to the airport so I've had plenty a meeting here. Not bad, service could be a bit faster, but not bad at all.Can't rate it much higher given that its' a franchise."}
{"text":"The food was really tasting good, ordered Parmesan Chicken Sandwich; Ciabatta bread was really fresh, chicken was tasty and the service by the waitress was really good.
I wanted to go with a brunch though at first but their brunch menu does not have many options."}
{"text":"I always find this location to be a mixed bag. It's never a great experience, usually average, but sometimes poor.

On my last visit here we sat in the lounge. The decor seems to be starting to show its age. There's bits of damage, worn seats, etc.

The service was alright. There were a couple of people working that sort of switched off serving us, maybe covering breaks. The food was fine, but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Best location and the service is amazing and the food it great and everyone is nice and great place for party's so I high recommend this place !!!!"}
{"text":"Didn't try food this time. Agree with other review a few more beer choices on tap would be a good thing. Super friendly staffers. 
I like the layout and even when full the place wasn't feeling too crowded. 
More of a lounge than a restaurant I thought."}
{"text":"Taste 2/5
Nothing extra in Moxie food. Fish in our taco were very small. Thin like fish size. 
Curry vindaye dish we took wasn't that spicy as should be a curry dish. Taste were blend. Lots of huge onions but not much meat in it.
Had to wait long for our cheesecake. When it came server apologized for the wait and gave us the cheesecake for free. Only then did we realize why. The cheesecake was very dry. Looks like a cheesecake that has been kept for a long time in the fridge. The edges were very dry and dark. 
Customer service 3/5  
We had different servers coming up at our table then someone will kind of push away the current server to say they will take over our table as it's theirs. Was weird"}
{"text":"This location has been open for three years already? Wow, time flies! I live very close by and drive past here practically every day, yet this is my first visit, although I've been to other locations during this time.

I met an old friend here for drinks on a Saturday evening. As expecxted, it was very busy but we managed to get a table near the bar. Very nice atmosphere, typical of an upscale bar but quite noisy with lots of chatter and music.

My friend's drink of choice was Caesar and I had beer. Although we had both had dinner already, after a couple of drinks, we needed something to nibble on. The Street Food Tacos, for only $3.00 each, sounded like the right thing. One chicken, one fish.

It took a little while but the tacos finally arrived. The presentation was a little confusing. We couldn't tell which one was which and the were served on some kind of foil wrapped vessel. Was this the Street Food part of the dish? How come the table next to us had a nice looking stainless steel taco holder?

Instead of sharing, we decided to just choose one. My friend got the chicken and said he hoped my fish had more flavour. First bite into it, I ended up with an inch-long bone stuck in my lower gum. Ouch! After getting over the shock and pain, it wasn't bad. The flavours were subtle but good.

Nice place, okay food, but the service could have been better. Our server was a bit abrupt. The main reason why we didn't share is because we had no cutlery or even napkins. That loud music I mentioned earlier? It got even louder when a DJ started playing. I'll probably come back but it won't be at the top of my list of local joints."}
{"text":"I dropped in here with some friends after a round of golf. One of my playing partners is a regular and chose Moxie's because it was Wednesday and that meant half price bottles of wine. No argument from me.

We ordered mostly appetizers, which were big enough for a light meal, and ended up having a couple of bottles of wine.

The chicken wings were decent, ordered with only salt and pepper, with BBQ sauce on the side. They were nice and crispy but needed the sauce for some flavour.

The Beef Dip sandwich with side salad was good but probably didn't need the horseradish aioli. The au jus dip should have been enough.

The nachos was a well dressed generous serving that ended up in a takeout box because it was so much.

The Lettuce Wraps was the most interesting of the dishes we ordered. It was a well presented generous serving of stir-fried veggies with cashews and chow mein noodles with some carefully cut lettuce cups.

One fellow ordered the Salty Caramel Pecan Cheesecake for dessert. It must have been good because he didn't share. I think he might have licked the plate clean.

Overall, the food was decent and the wine was a good deal. I do have to mention a couple of incidents that happened right next to us. We sat at a high table near the bar so we could watch the baseball game. It was also the side of the bar where servers picked up their drink orders, and the pathway from the kitchen to the lounge and patio, and the pathway to the washrooms. Lots of traffic. We witnessed a few broken plates and glasses in the short time we were there. At least there were no guests involved. Opa!"}
{"text":"Kathrine was excellent. She was handling a party of 30 by herself a still managed to make my experience personal and special. She didn't miss a beat with food or drink the entire time. The steak au poirve was perfectly cooked and the lemon quinoa was an excellent side with it. Adding some citrus notes the pepper sauce which was great on it's own."}
{"text":"Went with my two girl friends the other night. I ordered the \"grilled salmon on naan bread\" -- it was absolutely delish! My girl friends had bellinis that night - they said it was really good. The sweet potato fries were mediocre. One of my friends ordered the lobster and brie sandwich, but said it was too salty and rich. All-in-all though, it was a great night due to our friendly waitress who was joking with us throughout."}
{"text":"I just got a salad which was fine as well as a white peach bellini which I love from every Moxies. But I'm writing this review because our server was truly... memorable. And not in a good way. She was polite, but overly nice, in a way that made her seem fake. I wouldn't care, normally, but she was just a little too much. If you ever go to this Moxies and you get the server I had, and she serves the way she served my group, TRUST ME, you will know. I appreciate that she was nice but it was to the point where it seemed ungenuine."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited this location on a Saturday night. We were expecting a busier night because a Leafs game was on. It was a pretty impressive atmosphere, just right for a date night. It wasn't too packed, but there was the right amount of energy in the room. 
The music was at a decent volume, and the clientele weren't rowdy or loud (like at some other restaurants in the vicinity!)
Our server was really helpful in offering info about our choices and answering questions. He gave me a sample of the beer I wanted to try before I ordered, I though that was pretty great customer service. 
The food was above average as well. We ordered a typical option: nachos with shredded chicken and all the fixings. We were both really satisfied with the amount of toppings and the serving size in general. 
Overall, this was a really good alternative to some of the other locations in the area... don't let the fact that it is attached to the mall deter you! Thanks Moxies STC"}
{"text":"Went to this place last night after work with a few co-workers, they had quite a long wait but we were able to sit in the bar area after only about 15 minutes. They had the baseball game, and the football game going which was great entertainment for the guys we were with. Nice atmosphere, great service, and good food. We ordered the huge plate of Nachos and they were by the far the best nachos I've ever had! Soooo good! Afterwards we had the fish tacos, very fresh- and our drinks were great as well! I would come back, and I would recommend this restaurant if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Came to Moxie's  Restaurant because my son has severe food allergies and I heard they could accommodate him. The manager Chris P. met with me and assured my wife and I he could accommodate my son's allergy needs. He was professional, kind, and on top of his game. The best part was we were in town for a hockey tourney and we brought a party of 16 people in total. Everyone loved their food and enjoyed the great service. We are  in town for a few more days and will definitely be coming back. I wish I could give more \"STARS\"."}
{"text":"Went here on Sunday March 20 for our (adult) daughter's birthday celebration with the family. We had an excellent time, the server (Ty) was friendly, funny and very attentive without being annoying. The food was wonderful and they gave the birthday girl a free dessert, which was a very nice gesture. All of us were so impressed that I spoke to the manager before leaving the restaurant about our terrific experience.
Will return there soon!"}
{"text":"My son and I wanted a good burger and Moxie's is amongst the best. Very busy however we were able to get a table. Waitress was very quick to give menus and take our drink order. We both ordered pop and our burgers arrived promptly by another server. We never saw the waitress again. No one came back and asked if we wanted anything else and then we waited for our bill. We waited some more  In total we waited for about 25 mins and finally asked the hostess to please get our bill. The food was fantastic but by far the worst service I have ever encountered."}
{"text":"Normally I do enjoy Moxies. 
However this Moxies was SMALL. Our service was horrible. Out of us 4 only 1 order was correct. Definitely won't return to this Moxies in the future"}
{"text":"grand restaurant immense pour aucune raison. musique très forte (lounge). place de 5 à 7 corporate centre ville. 
service très très lent et inefficace malgré beaucoup d'employéEs. mon assiette est arrivée complètement froide avec la mauvaise cuisson. 
toutes nos factures ont été mélangées en sortant. bref... Un fiasco total.
le manager à bien voulu me rembourser pour mon plat."}
{"text":"Been here many times over the past few years. Every time I visit the food I order as a main/entree is always a disappointment. The prices are too high for the quality of the food. The only thing I absolutely love is the dessert. The tasting trio is to die for. The recent increase in prices is a disappointment as the portions remain the same. I would only go for the dessert."}
{"text":"@moxies_square1 #MOXIES #SQUAREONE #YELPGTA

The management had called me up and apologized for my last experience at Moxies. And they promised to change things around here. Sometimes the management staff will really just say whatever for the customer's solace. But I am surprised and glad they kept their word. 

Upon a hungry visit to Square One, I stumbled upon Moxies again, taken aback in a nice way to see such well-dressed girls. No LBDs or plunging necklines. The food, drinks and dessert, as usual, were excellent, as was the service this time around. No complaints. Keep it up Moxies!!"}
{"text":"Wow. Holy cow. We had an amazing experience at Moxie's--came rolling into town from the States with only snacks and sugary treats to get us by during the day, and we chose Moxie's since it seemed reasonably priced. Not only was the food spectacular (I recommend the French dip beef sandwich) but our server and the manager are like BFFs to us now. . Definitely a place to visit if we ever come back to Calgary and a huge recommendation from us if you're looking for great food and service at a reasonable price!!"}
{"text":"This place is all show and NO go. Atmosphere and decor only go so far with a real foodie. If you eat here order extra napkins to wipe up the drool from the hot women. But the food is garbage. I think my 10yr old could cook better. To be specific I had the soup of the day which was a Thai chicken to start and philli cheese  steak for the main. The cheese steak was l like cheap over salted deli meat on a cheap bun, barely any cheese."}
{"text":"I know some people love this place and in terms of decor I would agree. Decor is not the main thing I look for when I choose a place to eat though. I value service and food more. Service is great, servers very attentive and information but the food is not impressive.

The appetizers were good, calamari and brushetta but the rest of it is average. I'd still take a place like Jack Astor's or Canyon Creek over this place."}
{"text":"It was Sunday night happy hour to dinner time and it was empty with no vibe at all.  Atmosphere was boring and the food was meh.  Actually my Thai Curry bowl was gross and bitter I only had a few bites before I ended up trying to fill up on the two tiny triangle naan bread that came with it.  I wish we had of gone across the street to Earls, they have way more going on over there."}
{"text":"Moxie's is pricey, but I like it.  I ordered a Seared Tuna Spring Salad.  The tuna was very fresh.  The dressing was obviously mixed inhouse, because it tasted nothing like the bottled stuff.  It channelled a Mexican flair.  What a unique salad surprise!  It is expensive at $18.  

The other 3 dining mates all ordered a big hamburger.  They said it was good.  It costed $3 to switch from French fries to sweet potato fries, though.  Ouch!

Our server was nice. She made no fuss about splitting bills, including splitting one dessert on 2 bills."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of Moxie's. I find the quality of their dishes to be very delicious and I've never had a problem with their service no matter which location I go to.

No exception with this location in Fairview Mall. Candice was our server and she was really awesome. Many of us had waters as well as our other drinks and she was on top of getting us a fresh glass of water when we were low.

I haven't been to Moxie's in a while as I have been living in the UK for the past year, so it was really refreshing to know that their food is still as good as the last time I was at a Moxie's.

The only thing I have an issue with the restaurant is it doesn't accommodate large groups very well. I asked for a table for 8 people, they said the only tables they could put together in the dining room were occupied, and the tables they could put together in the lounge was reserved, so they had to put together 2 round tables which a few had to sit awkwardly in the group.

So if you're planning to go as a large group, make sure you call ahead and reserve yourself a table or else you'll be stuck with round tables and low light fixtures you might walk into when you get up."}
{"text":"Was pretty please with my meal here, I ended up having it waivered due to there being a piece of glass in my drink that I nearly choked on. Gotta give it to management how they handled the situation. Good times with good food and drinks with great company. Service was good! This place can get pretty busy. Make reservations to avoid line ups."}
{"text":"This was one of the best experiences I've had at a restaurant, surprisingly a chain restaurant. It was my first time visiting a moxie's and our friends had raved about the food. I ordered to top sirloin with mashed potatoes and vegetables ($19.99), while others at our table got chicken and ribs and the stuffed burger. For drinks I had ordered the blue zen, and my friend the peach bellini. I told the waitress I was allergic to peach and she made every effort to make sure that the glasses were washed and she kept coming back to ask me questions on if certain things were okay that may or may not come in contact, which I definitely appreciated. After about 20 minutes our table got our food and I had gotten my steak medium well. Unfortunately, it was well done which is not the way I like my steak and was dry for my tastes. Even though I had eaten my vegetables and half my potatoes before tasting my steak (I tend to do that often), when I had mentioned it to the waitress, they didn't just make me a new steak they had made me a whole new plate. For me that goes above and beyond to make my experience as good as possible. The new steak was much more to my liking in terms of cook, and as well had better seasoning and sauce on top and the potatoes were even hotter than before. The manager had come to my table to make sure it was done right and even gave me a free dessert because he felt bad. Besides, the quanitity of the meal, the quality when it was done right was amazing. The server was very sweet during the entire time and I would definitely visit this location again."}
{"text":"Great restaurant with the utmost desire to please their customers! For me the food taste better when service is just as good.

Emma our server was the best! She took care of us, during our time and ensured that our table was taken care of. Small things such refills of drinks and bringing extra napkins goes a long way. She is ahead and sure that we just enjoyed our night and the food.

The food was delicious and presented beautifully, but nothing that I would go back for due to cravings. I lie, the white chocolate brownie was a delight, I would go there and just eat that. I'm such a sucker for chocolate.

The ambience of the place is amazing, perfect place for a for a date, hangout or to enjoy a nice dessert lol. If I was a resident of the Richmond hill, I would honestly be here at least once a month for some good grubbin."}
{"text":"Nous y avons été pour le petit déjeuner. Le cadre est très sympas. On est bien installé. Par contre la carte n'est pas très clair. C'était bon et assez copieux mais je suis un peu déçue de mes pancakes. J'avais compris sur la carte qu'ils éraient servis avec des fruits mais en fait si on veut les fruits il y a un suplément. Un peu cher aussi mais ils ne lésignent pas sur la quantité."}
{"text":"Came here with some friends after watching a movie. We had some beer and a plate of nachos. Nachos were really good and the service was excellent. It's also open until 2 am on Friday evening so it's a great place to hang out late if you're in the area."}
{"text":"The decor is nice and the Server was super nice and attentive to our needs. We didnt want to order from the brunch menu so we got the regular menu and everything sounded great!
I ordered the chicken mareida rigatoni. The mushroom taste was a bit strong but still super yummy. My stepson orderes the bacon and mushroom burger and two cheese amd broc soups which he devoureddddd! 
I would definitely come back to try different things on the menu!"}
{"text":"Went back for lunch the other day.
Specifically because they have a decent patio and it was a great day for a patio.
I had the Blackened chicken burger at the servers suggestion.  Usually if I'm getting a burger it'll be beef.  But this was a really, really good chicken burger.  Not at all dry, tender and a good sized portion.  Service was fantastic, patio was great.
So, had to upgrade them to a 4."}
{"text":"I went to Montreal last summer with a friend, we got lost trying to find the underground city and came upon this place. The staff was very friendly, we were seated right away and were paired with an amazing waitress. She sat down with us and recommended a lot of great places to check out that mostly locals go to. The food was delicious my friend got steak and potatoes and I got chicken alfredo. The best part of the meal were the amazing frozen bellinis we had, they were heavenly. If you ever find yourself lost in downtown Montreal I hope you wander into this place, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Great food, great service! 

We often come here with a big group of co-workers. The atmosphere is great for after-work drinks (Hello Bellinis!) and apps. And can I just say, they have gorgeous washrooms! 

The food is great. Everything is super tasty. Likes: Chicken Wings, Calamari, Mosaic Dip (if you like mushrooms, this is a must try), Nachos, Fish Tacos, Quesadillas, etc. Oh, and the Parmesan Chicken & Crispy Prosciutto Sandwich is killer. So good!

The service is a tad slow at lunch (through the week), so if you're in a rush to get back to work, it's likely not your best option."}
{"text":"I stopped in at Moxie's Grill & Bar for a late dinner on a rainy night after checking into my hotel nearby. 

I like the modern atmosphere here with the good selection of menu offerings including sandwiches, burgers, pasta/rice dishes, salads, steaks, seafood, chicken, and some interesting appetizers and desserts. An extensive beer, wine, and cocktail list was at my table.  The prices here are moderate, most sandwiches/burgers $11.99-$15.99 and most dinner entrees $13.99-$31.99. 

Upon arriving, I was promptly seated in a booth in the main dining area by the hostess. It took a few moments for a waitress to come over and take my order.

For dinner, I went with the Beef Vindaloo ($16.99), which was served in about 10 minutes. This entree had tender slices of beef smothered with a very spicy and hearty sauce, shredded coconut, peppers, onions, & spices, drizzled with yogurt & mint leaf on top of very soft jasmine rice, served with warm soft buttered curry naan slices. I finished this tasty meal quickly, but I decided to pass on the offer for dessert since it was getting late and I had enough spicy food. I would've ordered the Sticky Toffee Pudding with French Vanilla Ice Cream ($7.99) if I saved room. They also had a Mini Sticky Toffee Pudding ($3.99) on the menu as well.

The background music playing over the speakers was a mix of rock and pop music (a few years old). They actually played one of my favorite pop tracks, Falling Down by Selena Gomez, which came out in 2009. 

The service here was overall decent and laid back as the waitress came by to check on my table a couple times during the meal. As requested, I was given a refill on the house water."}
{"text":"Came here for late night snacks and drinks with a friend. The dry ribs is not a joke. Its so dry with no flavour. The taco was meh, nothing special, and not worth $4. It took forever to get the waitor's attention, asked for ketchup multiple times, and had to ask another waitress for help. Had to literally flag down a waitress for attention."}
{"text":"Great food although a bit pricey. Had a group of 4 for lunch and it was awesome. Nothing left on anyone's plate. I had a salmon Caesar that was prepared perfectly. Attentive staff and fast service."}
{"text":"This is a classic case of one of those establishments that thrive purely from their prime location rather than any merit. I dropped by on a Thursday night and encountered the expected Thursday-night corporate crowd. The place was packed; if you arrive past 6, be prepared to potentially wait for a table. I ordered a burger which was decent, basically in a passable way. Nothing stood out about my experience here, but nothing terrible happened either. The only thing worth mentioning is that the servers were excellent and friendly. Other than that, it's a pretty mediocre experience."}
{"text":"Conveniently located in Yorkdale right across from the movie theatre, Moxie's serves up fairly average food at reasonable prices in a modern, comfortable setting.

The menu here spans your run-of-the mill Canadian offerings: steaks, burgers, pasta, along with a few ethnic offerings like Asian noodles and tacos. I opted for the alfredo and thought it was pretty average. My dining partner had a steak which was cooked excellently and was a great piece of meat, so kudos to them for that. Prices are fairly reasonable but I would have preferred if the servings were a touch larger.

The setting is interesting. Laid back and modern, most of the restaurant consists of booths, equipped with USB ports for customers to charge their phones. Service was decent and our waitress was customarily pleasant.

Overall, decent place to get a meal if you're at Yorkdale. Nothing particularly impressive however. If I were to choose, I'd head over to Joey's instead."}
{"text":"I've tried a few of the main dishes here in the past (the burger this time), but the real star of the show here is the famous white chocolate brownie. That dish alone would get a solid 5 stars. It's unique, it's delicious, and it doesn't have that overly flour-y taste that 99% of brownies have. This is something you'll definitely want to try.
Everything else is pretty mediocre (my burger was a little overcooked and chewy), but I will say that the service at this location is usually pretty fantastic."}
{"text":"If I'm not mistaken, this Moxie's is one of the original in Alberta.  Don't quote me, but I recall someone mentioning that to me.  Regardless, I have eaten at this Moxie's on a few occasions and enjoyed each visit.

Just to be clear, I love Moxie's.  It is probably my favourite chain of restaurants.  Part of this stems from my friendship with someone who owns a few locations (not this one) in Alberta and having frequented the location in Fort McMurray.  But, not all Moxie's are the same.

While the food is standard across most locations, with some small exceptions, the service is not.  I have been to locations where the service was horrendous and the quality of the food was subpar.  Thankfully, this location is not one of them.

Although one of the smaller Moxie's in Alberta, this one is really well done and has a great atmosphere.  It does have a small lounge though, so don't be surprised to be waiting on a busy night, perhaps a little longer than at a larger location.  But the service you will receive once seated is excellent.

If you haven't been to Moxie's before, order the three dip med bread for your appetizer and finish off your meal with the white chocolate brownie.  Trust me, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever! 
Recently visited the Richmond Hill location (Hwy 7 & East Beaver Creek)
Made a reservation for a work function and they gave away our table because we were 10 mins late. The hostess said they only hold the tables for 15 mins (which we were under) and had zero remorse. 
Brutal customer service and I will never go back. My office of 400+ employees agree."}
{"text":"We dined here on a Saturday night around 5 PM. Since there was a 25 minute wait for a table we went into the bar area and surprisingly got a nice booth right away.

We ordered the Portobello burger, loaded burger, lettuce wraps, and a couple drinks.

From the vegeterian perspective the Portobello burger was small and not very good. Everything else was ok but overpriced for what you get. Not surprising for a chain restaurant in a busy mall."}
{"text":"I really liked the calamari mediterranean salad I ordered here. Huge serving. I felt like I consumed a whole bag of salad. Haha... Can't go wrong w/ mixed greens, spinach, feta, and a tasty balsamic vinaigrette. The brocolli cheese soup wasn't bad either. 

Midway through dinner, the lights dimmed, and that made things a little weird for a sec. I was just glad to have my food at that point. I would've needed to whip out my phone for some light to read the menu.

I'm also quite partial to the starters here. They're decent servings & could be a meal for one if you just happened to come in for a quick meal & a drink. (note, the drinks are gooood). i recommend the wasabi tuna tartare & the three dip med bread.

Like most Moxies, this place is well maintained & decorated. It's always poppin'. I like that you can \"be loud\" in this kind of restaurant. I don't mean screaming... but you can carry a friendly conversation, laugh, and not feel self-conscious about it whether you're in the dining room or at the bar."}
{"text":"All Moxies at all times are busy -- even if you make a reservation...

I've been to this location twice. Once on a Saturday and the other time on a Wednesday. Would you believe that I waited longer for a seat on a Wednesday night with a reservation than on a Saturday night without a reservation?! Believe it.

Either way, I love the food & the drinks. Their seasonal menu is especially good this Spring. The daily drink specials are also a plus. 

Bring on the Bellinis!"}
{"text":"En réponse à Général M., ce message doit être passé à vos serveurs... Car la notre nous à clairement répondu que le menu était exclusivement pour les clients du bar."}
{"text":"I'll write more later, but for now in summary: 

Always have had very pleasant servers. 
The food is good and the atmosphere is nice."}
{"text":"I called in for delivery and I ordered the ovan roasted chicken. The service was quick and the food was tasty ! Definitely a repeat !"}
{"text":"Have been here multiple times to watch games, after work drinks, and for dinner. Service is always great and I like that they change their menus once in a while!

Favourites: white chocolate brownie, hard lemonade    ($6 after 9pm), korean fried cauliflower (KFC) and the poke!

Had the marguerita pizza and KFC today. The marguerita pizza had a crunchy crust with a thin layer of flavourful toppings (cheese, basil and red pepper flakes). The KFC was delicious as always too - fried and coated in the right amount of sauce.

Will be always be back!"}
{"text":"The service was very slow and put waiter kept disappearing/didn't fill our water, but it was late, near closing. Anyway the food was great, consistently good, for a franchise, the food is really good! The mango chicken was better than the free run goat cheese, but I honestly remember the free run chicken tasting better in Toronto and London, I'm not sure if it was a bad night or the chef was new.. I probably won't order it again, I'll try something else and hope for a better outcome.

The setting is really nice, dim lit, charming but modern, good for date night or girls night out, or just drinks. I actually want to try the Monday cheap wing night, I'm sure they're great! Anyway I'm happy to have a Toronto style restaurant here, it's rare and refreshing."}
{"text":"Took over 20 min for drinks. Got some nice 'tude from the server when we wanted our bills separate. Took about 3-4 servers to get 6 drinks ready. I think the required high heels are really slowing things down. Won't be back."}
{"text":"This was my first time at a Moxie's restaurant (I live in California) and I really enjoyed it. We came for appetizers and drinks. 

I recommend the warm mosaic dip and the chicken tenders. However, I do not recommend the calamari - I've had much better. 

As for drinks, the peach bellini was delicious. Being a Californian, I've had many margaritas so believe me when I tell you the margaritas at Moxie's are complete sh!t. 

The best part was dessert. We had the white chocolate brownie with icecream. It was to die for!

5 stars for the brownie and atmosphere/setting. I loved the interior design. 
3 stars overall for the appetizers and drinks"}
{"text":"Best place in town for all broccoli lovers. You get 2 half head of broccoli when you order a steak. And..since you have a sharp knife, you might as well chop of your broccoli!"}
{"text":"It is close by the airport (2-3 miles ?) and close to all the hotels nearby. 
On one side is the bar, with some pretty cool booth, and on the other side, the restaurant.  Seems that the bar has waitresses and the men in our party was pretty disappointed to have to go to the restaurant side.  Anyway
Food was good, i had a fish (if only i could remember which) that was really well cooked, with coconut rice.  That was super good, not too sweet.  I had a chocolate espresso mousse for desert that i did not finish, for some odd reason, it was just too sweet or something ? i just love mousse usually.
Other 3 at the table seemed happy with dinner too.  Steak seemed to be a tad overcooked"}
{"text":"Average food with good service.

Started off with a white peach bellini ($5 special) - tasted good and was sweet in flavour but I consider these very expensive slushies. Comes with a gummy frog candy. I have no idea why they put those on but it was there.

Mosaic dip $13.75 - I think this was the best item we had throughout the whole meal. It was basically flatbread with a side of warm goat cheese with diced tomatoes. Sounds simple but tasted good.

Beef Dip $14.75 +$1 to substitute fries with broccoli cream soup. I think the soup was good and tasted even better than the beef dip itself. The bread of the beef dip had sprinkles of salt but it seemed like someone dropped like a spoonful of salt on the bread. This just ruined the whole sandwich. The dip was nothing special and neither was the meat. I would recommend avoiding this sandwich because it really didn't taste good at all.

Lobster and shrimp linguini $23.75 - came with three large shrimps and half a baby lobster tail. I think one shrimp had the same amount of meat as the half lobster tail. Came with a buttered bread. Not worth the money they charge and I would also recommend avoiding this dish, not because it tasted bad but because its just not worth $23.75.

To end off the meal of course I had to try dessert. Got the tasting trio for $11 which comes with mini versions of the white chocolate brownie, sticky toffee pudding and salted caramel pecan cheesecake + a scoop of ice cream. Best one was the cheese cake in my opinion. Nothing special with the other two desserts. Once again I would have to recommend avoiding this dessert and probably just get the cheese cake by itself. 

Our server Inesa was great."}
{"text":"Haven't been to Moxie's in a while and a friend decided to celebrate his birthday here. wasn't really hungry so wanted to order the Tuna Poke appetizer but asked if ginger and green onions could be left out, they told me it couldn't be done as it was part of the sauce which is fine. Ordered the Sushi cone instead... Came with Ginger INSIDE the cone.... ==\" which to give benefit of the doubt the waitress may not have known. But the quality of it was so bad in general. It came with rice paper wrapping which was new age and fusion-y which is fine. But they didn't even use Japanese rice or a more glutenous rice so the cone just fell all over the place and the rice just spilled out. They show cased it as a really \"portable\" food but it was not. Shrimp tempura inside was mediocre and did not have enough Seaweed to bring out the taste. Who ever came out with that menu really dropped the ball. On top of that it was $13 for the 3 dingy cones.... serves me right for ordering Japanese styled things in a western restaurant I guess.

My friends also ordered pasta and salad. The Rigatoni was too greasy, Seared Tuna salad did not have enough dressing as they just \"fancily\" dressed the plate. 
I began to remember why I don't dine at Moxie's anymore...."}
{"text":"We Came here last week for a last minute belated birthday dinner during the week on a Thursday. The wait to get seating was about 20 mins for the 3 of us, although I did notice it wasn't busy. 

Our server was nice and attentive, the food was good. We ordered fish tacos, grilled salmon sandwich, and I had the steak sirloin dinner(medium rare). I wouldn't say the food was pricey but it was a bit above average. The quality was okay. It was a nice atmosphere, music was great. There is two parts to this restaurant, One part is the bar side the and the other was the regular seating area. I saw many tables with parents, so maybe thats the trend here? Bring your parents here for a nice dinner. And maybe a drink?

 If I come here again I'd make sure to Come when it's not busy or just make reservations."}
{"text":"We just had desserts during this visit.

Price: $8.75 (each) for a full size white chocolate brownie and cheesecake. 

Taste: The cheesecake was average. It wasn't amazing but it wasn't bad. I was a little disappointed with the brownie. It was one of my favourite desserts since Moxie's opened in Toronto. When I had it this time, it was dry and it didn't taste fresh. 

Atmosphere: It is great for date nights. It has a romantic atmosphere. 

Service: Our server was great. It was very busy in the restaurant but our server made sure that we were taken care of. 

Overall: We will go to this restaurant again since their main dishes were pretty good when we went to this location a few months ago. However, we will probably skip the dessert."}
{"text":"Good food just very shaking waitress spilling beer, forgetting guacamole with our nachos. Only saving grace is good company."}
{"text":"Thus moxies really transformed!
The old place was lacking in both customer service and food quality which really drove me away. However, this new location is absolutely fantastic!

- I ordered the chicken sandwich which was delicious, flavorful,  and juicy. I also had a ceasar cocktail and was very happy with both the taste and large size (in comparison to the small cup o' ceasar at earls). However, I did take away one star because my friends mojito was pretty bad and tasted like water. 

- the decor is beautiful, both in the bar area and the dining room. I particularly loved the bar booths right beside the large windows!"}
{"text":"I've been here many times because it's a nice place to come to while shopping at Yorkdale, and I really like their herb chicken alfredo, but this place also has some huge cons.

For starters, the food isn't anything special. I feel like you're paying for the ambiance (which is really nice), but is unfortunately ruined by miserable staff. On my most recent trip, the boyfriend and I stopped in for a late lunch. We were seated in the bar, and a waitress came over and had attitude oozing out of her (bad day, perhaps?). She asked what I wanted to drink, I said \"water\" and she just walked away without even asking my boyfriend what he wanted to drink. It took her ages to come back, she placed two glasses of water on the table, then disappeared again without a word. Her miserable attitude and poor service went on throughout our visit. Sorry, but short skirts and plunging necklines aren't going to make people like you & give you good tips if your attitude sucks and your behaviour is rude.

The food was decent, I had my usual herb chicken alfredo & my boyfriend got a burger, which he was satisfied with. I've had their white chocolate brownie here many times, and it can be hit or miss. Sometimes it's wonderful, other times it can be very dried out. 

Overall it is a very pretty place with okay food, but the staff always behave like they hate their lives & you're to blame. Would it kill them to smile once and a while?"}
{"text":"Moxie's is a good standby that's stood the test of time in Toronto.
The menu is dependable, the staff are competent and the ambiance is a good mix of classy/trendy without being too over the top.

This location (in scarborough town center) hit all of those points. The staff were great and the food was perfect. The steak was well portioned, perfectly cooked and tender soft. The cocktails were well mixed and the burger was amazing too.

The menu is diverse enough that most people will find something they like. Steak, Burgers, Red Thai Curry, Beef Vindaloo, Teriyaki bowls... the list goes on.

They frequently have seasonal menu's as well and from my experience, this can be hit or miss depending on the offering. But their traditional standby's usually hit the spot."}
{"text":"We came to this restaurant for desserts and drinks. We were seated at the bar. The service was slow and we were not given water until we asked. The dessert is phenomenal. Service could improve."}
{"text":"I've come to this Moxies many times & over all I'm happy with the place. It's nothing amazing but I've had good times here. I've come here for everything from dates to work dinners. It's been fine for all occasions. Depends who's working on how service will be. Sometimes you can get a rather rude server, or just someone who does.t want to do there job that day but over all service has been good. They change there menu a lot so it's always something different. I kind of like that. Foods always good, drinks are even better. It's very pricey for what you get but from time to time it can be a nice change."}
{"text":"I am very impressed with this Moxie's location. First and foremost the servers are very beautiful, sexy, polite and have excellent customer service. The day I was there they all looked like gorgeous lingerie models. Secondly the food was delicious. I ordered a starter and a main. The food came out warm and fresh. Thirdly the place was clean and had a nice upscale layout. The washroom was in great shape. I'd have to say this was best experience at any Moxie's. I'm looking forward to returning there."}
{"text":"The only reason I gave this any rating because of its location and nice layout of the inside of the restaurant. Other than that I've been pretty disappointed the few times I've been here. The food is very over priced and not very good. I ordered steak plate and a single sized nacho plate. They both came out cold and presentation of the food was awful and disorganized. Also the girls(waitresses) who worked there looked like they were anorexic and were very covered up then what I had remembered when I had came to Moxies in the past. I remember going to Moxies in the past when the waitresses wore short tight mini skirts and had sexy beautiful bodies. I dont think there is very good management at this location. If you're not going ot have good food at least have sexy looking and dressed waitesses."}
{"text":"So, I had a recent christmas get together with some old workmates. Moxie's seemed to be the most convenient location, so Moxie's it was. My friend doing the organizing definitely discovered that. First of all, I came in early. I asked about the reservation under several names, but the hostess could find none. When I asked if I could take a spin around, she snorted \"fine, but you're not going to find anything\". As I finished my spin, I ran into our organizers. We asked, and again the hostess could not answer. She called her manager who took a long time in coming down. I'd like to mention that this was five on a Monday night. Come on, they were barely busy. Anyways, it was only then that we found that our table had been booked upstairs in the lounge.

My friend left a few names with the downstairs hostess just in case people ran into the same problems we did. As people arrived, we discovered that they did. The waitresses apparently had the memories of goldfish. When asking for the gathering, they often weren't even informed that there WAS an upstairs.

The food we received was decent if bland. I ordered a glass of wine, and asked for a glass of water to go with it. All night, the waitress only remembered the paid drinks and rarely anything like water. 

The whole experience reflected badly on them. I mean, come on. The reservations were made well in advance, they must know the upstairs is difficult to find, and I know Moxie's can have decent service, although I didn't see it tonight."}
{"text":"One of the most chic interiors I've seen for a chain, but also the worst steak I've had in my life.  It was just horrible.  If it were not for the cool bathrooms and decor, this would be a 1."}
{"text":"I just have a few words about this restaurant, if you take forever to serve the damn food than the food isn't superb. My spring mix salad didn't have enough sauce, it just tasted like leaves. I also had the sweet chile chicken with chipotle chips, that was pretty good but the chicken wasn't warm. For dessert I had the white chocolate brownie, that I had no complains with, it was delicious. The G.T. drink was amazing. The portions are perfect.  I hate that it takes half an hour for my salad to come. The girls are very slutty dressed. I've noticed they only choose attractive people to work there. They should consider their qualifications not their looks."}
{"text":"Came here on a cold winter evening!  

We were hungry and a little tired.  

Ordered the calimari and a small caesar salad.  Calamari came out crispy and with a nice sauce!  Caesar was just perfect!  Booths offer perfect amount of privacy and noise level was not too loud!  Just as expected and satisfied!  Your typical family type restaurant menu with some different choices!"}
{"text":"Was craving a steak but wanted to avoid going to a steakhouse . Me and my boyfriend decided to hit up moxies in woodbridge. Steak was tender and flavourful. Diana served us and was great! Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I love the large patio here! And I love the fact that they turn on outdoor heating so even though the weather's a bit chilly, we can still hang out in the patio. Great idea Moxie's! 

Okay now onto the drinks. The drinks were a bit weak in my books. Totally watered down by ice. I had the mojito and the Tokyo lemonade. Tokyo lemonade was pretty good. Could be a bit stronger. Tequila might've been better than Vodka. Mojito was almost like water. Ice is just an excuse. I get the mojitos all the time at Milesotnes and it's still strong and minty and tasty. Seriously, not worth the price. Get beer instead. 

But then they redeemed themselves with the burger. The braised beef burger is A+ awesome. So flavourful - wonderful combination of braised beef, juicy burger, toasted soft bun, and fresh toppings. The fries are pretty great too. In fact, we ordered extra. 

Service was friendly, washrooms are lovely, my company was awesome!:)"}
{"text":"I'm giving Moxie's a 3.5

Good food - steaks are cooked just right, the cut was quite lean and not as tender and fatty as I liked but it was decent. Their braised beef burger is so flavourful and good, dessert trio is delicious and highly recommended! Prices are fair. Not cheap but not going to break the bank either. 

Great drinks selection but not a fan of the drinks. Why? They taste weak and watered down Eg watered down mojitos and tokyo lemonade. 

Atmosphere is alright, pretty loud on most nights especially in the lounge area, big screen tvs are good, nice and clean bathroom"}
{"text":"I rare ever give chain stores a 5 star rating so they're usually a 4 at most.  But when a chain store has a rating like this, it's because their service was mediocre.  I enjoyed the kale/quinoa salad quite a bit the other day and decided to re-order it at this location along with a margherita pizza. 

My kale-quinoa salad was quinoa-less and the portion was SO tiny.  Albeit still being full, I couldn't believe I paid $16 for two tiny little bowls (we requested it to be split).  The other Moxie's I went to had much more reasonable portions.  On the flip-side, it probably means my caloric intake was less...(yay! more chocolate for me! :P).  However, so much for the chocolate because I specifically asked for dressing on the SIDE.  My server even REPEATED it back to me.  And when it came...dressing was already mixed in.  Gross.  There's nothing worse than over-dressed salad, which is usually what happens and did happen in this case.  

The margherita pizza was also mediocre at best.  I don't know why it's so hard to do an even cheese distribution but my pizza looked like it had a skin disorder with multi-focal aspects of alopecia.  Cheese was seriously lacking and the crust was way too thick. 

Overall, this particular location earned 2 stars from me for mediocre service, mediocre food, and that salad...my goodness."}
{"text":"Moxie's is always a good bet when you're looking for standard fare at a decent price. 

The Shawnessy location has a lot of dark wood, giving in an upscale look. The cushions, funky lights and cool art soften it, making it \"accessibly upscale\".

My companions and I wrapped up our Saturday night there. It was late in the evening (after 9:00 pm) so it wasn't terribly busy. We were seated promptly and our server was friendly and attentive without hovering.

One companion ordered the tandoori chicken pizza. He said it was \"above average\" although \"it was hastily cooked\" (ah, unevenly cooked).

My other companion had the chicken & three cheese pizza. The tomatoes had a \"different\" taste to them but other than that, he gave it the thumbs up.

My shrimp curry rice bowl was moist, without being overly goop-y. The curry was subtle, just the way I like it. The shrimp were plump and juicy. I couldn't finish my meal so I got it wrapped up. It passed the \"Next Day Taste Test\" with flying colours.

It was too bad that were were too full to try the new trio dessert sampler. That will have to wait till next time!"}
{"text":"THIS IS MY FAVOURITE MOXIES LOCATION EVER. From arrival to the end, I got the best service ever. Hostess Beth was super kind when bringing me to my table. My server was Christina O and she made my experience so great, that this is now my GO TO restaurant. The white peach Bellini is my favourite, however I was a little disappointed when I heard you guys took the gummy bears out of the menu. Either way, I would rate this place 12/10 if I could, especially because it is so rare to find a great server as Christina made my experience the best."}
{"text":"I went here on a Friday night for dinner with a party of 5. The service was horrible. The girl was nice and they served our drinks fairly fast. They took a long time to originally take our order. My friend wanted a refill on beer and they ignored him twice. Then the manager came up to us and assured us he'd get us more beer and apologized for the wait. Then our food came and we needed utensils. We sat in front of our food for 15 minutes before anyone actually got us utensils. The service was bad, but the food was good."}
{"text":"Moxie's has been a go to for work meeting for a long time. I took a customer here today for quarterly meeting. This location is always great because the staff that work there are always friendly and responsive plus the food is also amazing. I had the beef vindaloo and my client had the regular burger and a soup. Both of our meals came out quickly and tasted great. I would have to say that the food seems to get better every time I come to this location."}
{"text":"While we usually enjoy what we order at Moxie's, the service during the last three visits has made the experience very disappointing.  Initially, service was pretty quick, placed our drink and dinner order.  We both ordered the loaded burger, with the mini salad/dessert promotion.   Received our drinks in a reasonable time.  Another table was seated about 15 minutes later.  We still hadn't received our salads.  That table then placed their order and received their food and we still didn't have our salads.  We stopped the manager who was expediting food.  Here, our server had not completed the food order.  When our salads were served by that manager, he mentioned he would comp us the \"promotion\" part of the dinner ($10 savings).  We thanked him for looking after us.  
Our burgers were good as usual.  We ordered special coffees with our dessert - however they came out separately (my husband insists on waiting until his coffee arrives, which doesn't bode so well for the melting ice cream with dessert!\".  
Dessert was good (as usual).  
When we received our bill, we had been comped the $10 promotion, however had been billed for the mini dessert.  
After all is said and done, my husband and I looked at each other and decided the poor service meant we probably wouldn't be back!  Too bad.  
The great news is the new Original Joe's off SunValley Blvd has a great patio and lovely outdoor heaters!"}
{"text":"2.5/5, +.5 for service

I've never really been a fan of chain restaurants, whether it's Moxie's, Milestones, Kelsey's, etc. However, one of my friends held a birthday party here recently and invited me, so I decided to join and have dinner at this Moxie's location.

This Moxie's branch is located inside Scarborough Town Centre, near Sears. It's quite large and has quite a chic seating area. Since I was with a large table, we were allowed to sit in the bar, where there are more large seating arrangements available.

I ordered the sirloin with prawn lobster butter, which was supposed to be one of their specialties. I specifically wanted the sirloin to be medium, as that's what I usually go when I order steaks.

The steak took a while to arrive, but it did eventually. Upon first cut, I can already tell that it was overcooked...there was barely any pink until I got to the middle. The steak was still quite juicy, but it definitely could've been even juicier if it wasn't overcooked. As for the prawn lobster butter, I didn't really taste much of the prawn lobster feel; there was definitely butter on it though, but it tasted like regular butter.

One of the people in my table also had an overcooked steak, and the hostess diligently exchanged her overcooked steak with a properly grilled one. I wanted to change mine as well, but opted not to since I didn't want the kitchen to waste another steak.

Service was excellent, despite the less than spectacular experience with my food. Not sure if I'll return though; I've definitely had better steak experience in several other places."}
{"text":"Wine is half price on Tuesdays!  Love their lettuce wrap! Great ambience. We sat on the bar area, too loud with people talking but the music is even louder."}
{"text":"It all started about 2 years ago when I developed a little addiction to their white brownie dessert. Now, I go to this moxies more than once every month and I have tried almost all of the things on the menu. The food is greattt, the drinks are greatt and the service is great."}
{"text":"Came here with my friends for a late birthday dinner. We shared the nachos and had individual meals. We went to this location on a Saturday night around 7pm. It was packed so we had to wait about 20 minutes for a seat. Our server was very attentive and makes sure to check up on us. She also recommended the white chocolate brownie as dessert, but we ended up ordering the Trio desserts which included small sizes of white chocolate brownie, toffee , and a cheesecake. The white chocolate brownie was delicious!! I'm going to make sure I order the larger size next time. Besides having noisey people seated next to us, we had a great time. My own food was great, I got the street tacos and herb Alfredo. Herb alferdo was a little bit boring and was not anything special. I probably won't order this again. However,  I got full already after the tacos. They were so filled up and packed! My friends ordered bombay soy chicken and a burger plus fries (forgot the name). I would definitely go again! I would like to try some other dishes."}
{"text":"In true Halloween spirit, we had a ghost for a server!

We went to Moxie's on Friday for dinner before heading off to an early-ish Halloween party. We'd gotten there about 4:30 or so, and at the time there were only two other tables seated so it was really quiet. The hostess sat us right away and said our server would be right with us. So we waited. 
And waited. 
And waited. 
20 minutes later, after watching the hostess walk by about 4 times and a server completely ignore us numerous times, we left. I'd love to give a review on the food but since we never even had a drink order taken by our ghost server, I can't. Moxie's, please get it together. That was ridiculous."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, both times for a Christmas party.  They were kind enough to book us into a private room, which was nice.  And the ceasar here is pretty darn nice.  

I'll admit, they food is okay at best. Three of us ordered steaks here, and one sent it back as over cooked, while the other two of us just stared at them and said \"this is a bit more medium than rare\".  

Overall, though, a good enough place. They have a G&T that's a delight.  I'll probably end up going back there again next year for Christmas."}
{"text":"I'm rarely disappointed when I go to a Moxies restaurant.

The Newmarket location is a restaurant that really has it all together.

Great service, good food, friendly staff, options for people with food issues, and nicely lit, and music playing at nice levels.

And the place is clean!  

I had the steak and shrimp with a side of quinoa.  The steak was spiced well, and was cooked to a perfect rare.

The quinoa was very pleasant and the shrimp was beautiful.

I highly recommend this place.

I do a lot of meetings in Moxies.  They are a great place to take anyone."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the Moxies chain.  I've eaten at many of Their locations.

I like the location in the Fairview mails. Lots of good seating.  It's very clean, and there is a lot of staff to keep things moving.

The servers area always friendly and I have never been disappointed with the meals that I have been served.

I have some limitations on my diet, so I typically order a steak and veggies.  It's always served juicy, and the veggies are delicious too.

My latest visit was no different.  Good service, friendly, clean, and lots of tables so I always get a seat pretty quick.

Great place for a party or a meeting with clients or friends."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Moxie's.  I've eaten at most of them in the local area.

The food is always consistent.  The service is always good.  The restaurants are famously clean.

This restaurant is a pleasure to eat at.  

I had a steak at Moxie's, and it was cooked to perfection.  I like my steak rare, and the steak came nice and juicy and a little cold In the centre.  The steaks are spiced nicely, but not too over the top.  I find the initial taste when I sink my teeth into the steak is just as pleasant as when I chew into each bite.  

I order the quinoa with my steak.  I find it a tasty accompaniment.  Some people just do quinoa well: fluffy, not to wet and not too dry, and accompanied by additional touches from the broth that it is cooked in.

I also quite enjoy their Caesar salad.  I get mine without croutons because I must maintain a gluten free diet.  Moxie's has been a champ for me as a go to place to eat because they understand how important this is for some people.

The server that served me was very knowledgeable, he was organized, and he made sure that I got something that was safe for me to eat.  

I've met my friends here often for meals because they have a wide variety of good options, and impressive desserts."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty solid higher-end chain restaurant.  It's a little pricey, so I only come when my coworkers are in town and we're all expensing dinner together.

Our company has an annual exam passing celebration where we take up the front area and order rounds of drinks and apps.

Generally speaking the apps are good, but they definitely aren't good with mixed drinks.  Maybe it's because I'm American and the drinks I order aren't commonly found in Canada?

They've had trouble figuring out the following requests:
- 7&7
- Red-headed sluts
- Black & tans
- Cactus cooler

A few other shots we tried to order were also met with blank stares.  I think it might be too classy of a place?

They also somehow ran out of tonic water.  How does that happen at a restaurant?  I swear I didn't drink THAT many gin & tonics."}
{"text":"30 for 30 challenge:

Why is everything in Canada so expensive?! Seriously, I can't believe how expensive these simple chain restaurants are.

My girlfriend and I came here and that day, they were doing a special on bell inis for $4 so we ordered 2. Um...the reason they're $4 is because there's pretty much no alcohol content. Look, I am a small person and I didn't even feel a buzz.

I also had the lobster and brie grilled cheese with fries.  I appreciate them letting me order off the sandwich menu when it clearly said it wasn't for nights.

Overall, the food was decent, the drinks weak and the prices far too high."}
{"text":"MOXIE'S is not just great food but awesome service, and great environment. 
We were served by Jack and he made us feel so special. I ordered chicken souvlaki with the house salad. The best ever. Cheese cake was next which I did not like.  It was crumbly. Even the lunch menu was excellent. Definitely going back for more good times."}
{"text":"At this location I ate better than the other locations, the food was great and the meals were looking great. But the service was not too good, the restaurant was empty and the servers didn't care, just kept talking in the corner and had no attention to our table."}
{"text":"Been to this location a few times... As it is located inside the busy Yorkdale Mall be prepared to wait 25-30 minutes for a table. Worth the wait as i always enjoy the food, the drinks, and the music in the lounge/bar area. My son digs it to which is always always plus."}
{"text":"Lovely place to have dinner at or just to have a drink or two. Service was fast and friendly. And not too loud so you don't have to yell at each other. Food was just as fast and well prepared. Would be a little out of my way but would return."}
{"text":"Overall depending on what day of the week you go, it's a good place to have a first date or a romantic night to celebrate a occasion. The hostess are welcoming and very easy on the eyes. 
The cons well, there not much variety in the menu but the food is still well present and tasty.
I had a enjoyable night but would have been better if there were no screaming babies around to ruin the night. If you going to bring you kids along, go to KEG or some other low class family diner."}
{"text":"Horrible service.  Waited at the front to be seated and it took too long so we just sat ourselves in the lounge area. Didn't seem like anyone was working for the first 5 minutes we were sitting there. Literally didn't see any wait staff on the floor, not even a bartender behind the bar. She finally came out from the back and still worked at such a slow pace. She was very unattentive throughout the whole time we were there. As well as what seemed to have been the host, there was no way she was a manager or supervisor. She ran the food to our table which took too long (for the mosaic dip and 2lbs of wings). No apology or anything. The mosaic dip was good. We got two rounds of wings since it was their wing night. Very inconsistent. First round had very little sauce, I had to ask for more. The second round we ordered another 2lbs and 1lb again had too little sauce but the 2nd lb was too saucey. Figured they would be somewhat the same since both were going to the same table. I guess I can't complain too much, it was only $2.99 wings. We ordered the white chocolate brownie of coarse afterwards and it took way too long. We asked about it and both our server and other staff went to check on it. After waiting for so long you figured the server would've checked on it herself. Anyways it finally came out and she apologized for it. Apperently the first one was burnt. Well obviously it would burn with such unattentive staff. 

All in all I wouldn't come back. I had heard about the bad service from friends who live in the area but a chain like Moxies (with such a high reputation) I figured they were over exaggerating. I was wrong."}
{"text":"I usually avoid going to franchises when I'm going out to eat, but Moxie's is a staple at Fairview Mall after retail therapy.

Service was okay, usually a bit of a wait, 5-15min on weekends before getting seated.
Waiters and waitresses are always pleasant, I lik'em. :)  One of them made the Miami Ice drink that I really liked (from Milestones) but not offered at Moxie's - tasted almost spot on, so props to them for my customized mocktail

Mains:
Slow-roasted baby back ribs:  Supposed to be fall-off-the-bone tender, but I had just the slightest struggle getting the meats.  However, I loved the sauce they used - it was a bit sweet and not at a spicy, like a mix between BBQ and honey garlic.  I also loved the stuffed potato that came with it, similar to The Keg's but minus the bacon.  The baked zucchini was also.. interesting.. but rather bland.  
Beef vindaloo: Had this a while ago, but its rich spicy yogurt over jasmine rice and curry-buttered naan bread totally left its impression on me.  It was quite spicy and I felt quite warm at the end, but I absolutely loved the dish. 
Salads:  Had various salads at Moxie's before.. the steak one, strawberries one, and salmon.  I think my favourite was the one with strawberries because the naan bread was perfect.  Steak was medicore and so was salmon - seasoning wasn't all there and you're better off ordering a main.

Dessert:  WHITE CHOCOLATE BROWNIE.  That's all."}
{"text":"I was at this moxie's randomly last night and I had a pretty awesome gin & tonic there. It had fresh lime leaves in it and this slurpy like crushed ice with some simple syrup. and it was only $6. beats the crappy drinks you get at most toronto bars! I was surprised."}
{"text":"I entered Moxie's with a hint of Montreal foodie scepticism. How can a chain from Western Canada try to compete in a market that practically defines dining out. OMG! Did I ever stand corrected. This place can teach many a Montreal restaurant how to treat a customer. Today was my fourth lunch there in the last month and each time I've been blown away by the food, the atmosphere and the service. 

Starting from the top, the manager, who I will now refer to as Amazing Amy, clearly sets the tone for the experience. The food is original, fresh, delicious and reasonably priced. Their house beer is excellent and cheap by downtown Montreal standards. And the service experience is up there with the best you will find in Montreal (and probably North America). Service is a cultural thing and this place knows how to nurture excellence in that domain (thanks, Amy!). Yes indeed, I stand corrected and thank my western Canadian brothers and sisters for teaching us Montreal food snobs a thing or three about the hospitality business.

Ok, did I mention the food? ;-) For starters, the sushi cones, lettuce wrap and potstickers (aka dumplings) are original, plentiful and delicious. You can make a meal out of their starters. For the mains, I've had the chicken & mushroom pizza (twice in a row!), cheese & bacon burger, fish tacos and beef dip. All fresh, tasty and perfectly portioned. Some are served with fries, which are amazing, even by Montreal's elevated standards. One time I dined with a friend who had the filet mignon steak and he said it was \"perfection on a plate!\" 

This place is packed every time I've been there so I'm probably preaching to the choir, but I still feel compelled to speak my mind and publicly give credit where credit is due. Thanks, Moxie's, for coming to Montreal! Look forward to returning soon!!"}
{"text":"Review #3 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012

Had a day off and a morning with my boy.  After running some errands in the morning it was getting time for lunch.  Instead of going home for lunch and then taking him to school we opted for lunch out.  We were in the South so we started talking about lunch options.  Well he is all pizza all the time.  Some of us get tired of pizza so we opted for a place on the way that would satisfy both.  Moxie's came into view.  Since I used to work in the area back in the day...I had been to Moxie's a few times with coworkers for lunch and the food was always OK.  

We were there early and as such there were only a few patrons in the restaurant.  I skimmed the menu trying to decide quickly what to have for lunch since we were a little pressed for time.  The boy had his usual \"I am a pizza\"......

My eyes caught site of the fish & chips on the menu several times.  I finally asked the waitress what kind of fish.  She went to the kitchen to find out and came back to report it was cod.  So I decided on the spot I would try the fish and chips since I am on a quest to find good fish & chips in Calgary.  Within 5 minutes of taking our order I could smell the fish and chips cooking.  I found this rather odd.  In a restaurant the size of Moxie's...being seated no where near the kitchen...all I could smell was grease combined with fish (if this were strictly a fish & chips place then ya I'd expect the smell...but not here).  I can not explain it but warning bells were going off and I immediately started having second thoughts about lunch.....

Lunch arrived and from first glance it looked fine.  And then first bite...greasy.  Second & third bites even more greasy if that's possible.  As I started picking it apart and tasting different sections of the fish...I found some of the batter to be super crunchy and other parts of the batter a bit undercooked and it honestly didn't taste like cod.  By this point I'd had enough to know I was going to pay for the grease later.  The french fries tasted like the fish....lifeless and dead on the plate.  The tartar sauce was heavy on the mayo with a few pieces of pickle cut up and mixed in.

My boys pizza seemed to be going down good...he had no complaints.  I should have ordered the pizza too.  I didn't get the chance to tell the waitress how bad the meal was as she was ignoring my waves to come over so we could get the bill as we were running late.  We finally had to get up with coats on to show we were leaving before she came over.

And about that grease...YUP did I ever pay for it later...with an upset tummy that stayed with me most of the day.

I ordered the fish & chips thinking it would either be bad or good..but it far exceeded bad by any standard.  And the quest continues...."}
{"text":"I have frequented Moxies Grill on 8th so many times that it merits a nice review from me.  This is a fancier version of a grill I thought it would be in my head; its elegant art deco interior with very well placed ambient lighting has consistently offered me and my friends' pleasant dining experiences. Service is consistently fine, and I think the prices are quite reasonable for the portions and presentations you eventually get.

I have had the calamari and variety of burger choices there, and my cousin had shrimp pasta, all dishes were well prepared and were more than up to standards.

The nice thing is at the end of the meal, you expect a large bill for the whole experience and are surprised upon receiving a bill just a tad higher than at a diner.  Moxies Grill; extremely accessible, affordable and pleasant."}
{"text":"My biggest pet peeve with any restaurant would be not having all the main courses at the table at the same time.  My fiancee and I were dining at this location for the second time (our first time was a great turn out) and I don't think I'll return to this chain again.  The service was extremely slow; we waited about 8-10 minutes just to be greeted by our server.  The alcohol came out fast which is always good but the turnoff for me that evening was eating AND completing my meal even before my fiancee received hers...The manager came and apologized but did not offer and consolations.  I'm sorry but if my fiancee has to watch me eat, her meal should be comp'd....end of story.  I had a wonderful time the first go, service was great and food was delicious, but I will not be returning after what had happen.  I'm giving it 2 stars based on the fact that my first visit was great."}
{"text":"Well, as usual when alone and travelling, I ate at the bar.  It was across the street from my hotel, but because I'm from the (American) southeast, and I hate the cold, and it was cold, I took a cab who happened to be sitting outside the hotel when I came outside.  And went across the street.  Cost me $4 to not have to spend 30 minutes warming up.

Took a cab back too - had the hostess ring me one. It started snowing during dinner.  That's just not ok.

At any rate - down to business.  They have a good selection bourbon, which is always a plus for me.  Drink prices are a little less than downtown - bartender was great.  He hates the cold too and perfectly understood.

Had the potstickers.  Meh.  Good but not great.  Ordered a new york strip.  Now here's where I was a little surprised - that thing was fantastic!  Cooked well, good cut of beef, nice char, real nice piece of meat.  I really enjoyed it.  Had, I believe, baby reds alongside - also quite nice.

So if you're sitting at either of the airport Marriott's and thinking to yourself that you just don't want to go downtown, but want a decent meal and good service, walk across the street.  

Or cab it if it's cold."}
{"text":"Moxie's is a well known Canadian, casual food chain. I ordered a medley of dishes while I recently dined at this restaurant. I was impressed with both their salads and meat dishes. Service was good and the price points were reasonable. A very good restaurant to attend before the Jersey Boys production at the Theater nearby. I had no trouble securing a table 1-2 hours before the show. 

I also liked the fact that I was able to dine for a late lunch. This was a pleasant surprise.

This place was A-OK."}
{"text":"Believe it or not, they served up the best beef (sirloin) vindaloo that I have had in recent memory! The flavors, textures and heat came together perfectly, and with warm garlic naan included, what's not to love! Perfectly balanced proportions to boot. 

Hat tip to Racquel for outstanding and efficient service!"}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday supper with friends in November and overall it's a good place. We were 18 people altogether and really the only problem was that  the space available to fit all of us comfortably at the time was in the lounge near the door which is a good space but instead of one long table it was four different ones with a bit of a space in between each and an additional table. The host and waitresses were helpful though so it wasn't a big deal. 

The food tasted really good! I think everyone I was with liked what they ordered and was full when they were done. Overall it's a nice place to go out and eat in a really good location downtown"}
{"text":"We came here the day before Mother's Day because it worked better with everyone's busy schedules. We didn't have a reservation so we waited about 15 minutes for a table for 4 in the dining room. 

Upon checking in on Yelp and seeing the 2.5 star rating, I was afraid we picked the wrong place to take our mother out to eat but our experience proves otherwise. Our server, Jason was one of the most charismatic and compelling servers I've had in a while. Our whole party was impressed! The server also comped a birthday dessert for our mom's \"birthday\" seeing as though Mother's Day was the next day (and they comped dessert for the mothers on Mother's Day) She was thoroughly surprised and happy about this. Kudos for the exemplary service by Jason! 

As for the food, we ordered bruschetta to share, and for mains we ordered the chicken and ribs, the burger with broccoli and cheese soup, 7oz sirloin steak (medium rare), and a steak sandwich (medium rare). The bruschetta was served as separates to build yourself (tomato, cream cheese and bread on their own on a platter). We would have preferred it pre made for us and with a balsamic vinaigrette like the usually do but we were told it's done this way to prevent it from getting soggy which may indicate that the food doesn't get run to the tables right away. As for the broccoli and cheese soup, it's very flavourful and smooth. The steak sandwich and was also pretty good but it was served with some sort of spicy sauce and not the usual sweet savoury sauce. Other than that the rest of the food was as expected."}
{"text":"I love their pepper salt wings it's just so delicious. I went with my ex back in December and I forgot my cell there. Staff was nice enough to keep it until I came back the next morning. A++"}
{"text":"Amazing!  Shrimp & Kobster fettuccine was Devine, bruschetta and calamari was scrumptious, and the white brownie desert and latte was heaven."}
{"text":"If you are a big party on a weekend, this place is your best chance at finding seats :-)
You can always rely on a decent and consistent service."}
{"text":"Mediocre service, Mediocre food Mediocre drinks...
and I repeat: Mediocre service.
for FULL price!

Example:
Our beer glass was 0.5 empty on top with foam dripping down the glass as if someone had taken a sip from it...! I asked our server and she said the glasses are too big, the beer in there is exactly how much it should be....!

Example:
It took them 20 minutes to bring some cups of tea and coffee. Tea was already cold and you could see it had been sitting on the counter for a while. 
This was in a quiet Tuesday night, not many customers in the restaurant.

Not going back."}
{"text":"After what seems like 2-3 years, I finally revisited this location of Moxie's. As always, the restaurant was quite busy and the atmosphere is nice. However, I found the menu to be smaller than what I remembered. I opted for the Chicken Madeira pasta but was quite disappointed. The pasta was mediocre and I was not a big fan of the sauce. It was too flavourful for my taste. The service was also very average. The only saving grace was the Moxie's white chocolate brownie which never fails to disappoint!!! I don't think I will be coming back to Moxie's anymore as other franchise chain restaurants have shown me better."}
{"text":"Great place.. great food... amazing drinks and desserts...!!! Great for dinner .. 
Would I go again? sure... 
Would I go with friends? No.. more like dating, girlfriend"}
{"text":"A busy, clean wonderfully located restaurant in the centre of the downtown waterfront core area but....that's where it ended.

What a dull, uninspiring menu to choose from. With the limited menu selection I choose the Blacken Chicken Breast sandwich. It came with a side of fries. The chicken sandwich was fairly tasty but I felt it lacked the \"zing\" I've come to expect from a blackened protein. My request for the fries was to have them well done but they came to the table just barely cooked. I didn't send them back but I should have. 

Our server was friendly but she seemed to be forced friendly. With all the competition in the same area I would go outta my way to eat here again. As a footnote....most all Moxies I've been to have been pretty good."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last nite (Nov 29/14). It was average food with an average menu & average servers. Nothing to get excited about but I wouldn't not go. Atmosphere was very nice."}
{"text":"This is what's left of the dinner appies that we had. Had the Dry-Rub Ribs which were pretty decent. Also had the Mosaic Dip which was absolutely amazing. The dip was hot & gooy & delicious. This place is close to the airport but a little out of the way. I didn't try any other food but I'm sure it's good."}
{"text":"I don't usually frequent Moxie's, but it was literally the only patio with tables open on a scorching hot day, so we decided to pop in for cocktails and an appy. When we walked in, there was nobody at the hostess stand so we figured it was a \"seat yourself\" kind of deal and started walking towards the patio. One of the managers (I'm assuming) asked us what we were doing, and we told him we were looking for a table...we explained there was nobody at the front but by this time, the young hostess had showed up and awkwardly took us to a table. Apparently they were short staffed. Not off to a great start, but I didn't think too much of it.

Once we were seated, we waited a few minutes for our server to come, and eventually ordered a beer for him and a bellini for me. I decided to \"Moxie-size\" it as I have done before and they're very good. It came out in a regular tall glass, and I actually had to ask if it was Moxie-sized. What happened to the big fishbowl glasses they used to have? It was pretty much a regular sized drink, and it was all blended together...not at all how a bellini is supposed to look or taste. That was a big disappointment.

We decided to order some wings and shrimp tacos. The server told us that the wings are only for dining in (?) so he would have to check if we could have them on the patio. Errrr. I guess they gave him the go ahead, because after 25 minutes we got our food. The shrimp tacos were actually really good! The wings were TERRIBLE. Breaded and soaked in sauce, they were soggy instead of crispy and just NOT good. The server didn't bring us side plates nor did he refill our drinks or check on us at all. Not that he didn't come by our table - he did - but he just ignored us. Once we flagged him down we just asked for the bill because we wanted to get the hell out of there. 

I used to enjoy coming to Moxie's and having cocktails and the platter (which was SO good!) but it seems like everyone working there now is SUPER young and it's their first serving job...bad customer service, bad food, and bad drinks! Never again."}
{"text":"I usually stay away from chains such as Moxie's, I've had too many bad experiences and there are just so many other yummy restaurants in Calgary to dine at. However, my girlfriend and I were looking for a place close to home to have a bite and get our drinking started. Having been to Joey's in Crowfoot a couple of nights before, we decided to head over to Market Mall. The place was packed, so we grabbed a couple seats at the bar. Because it was so busy, the server was all over the place, but we got our drinks and looked over the menu. My girlfriend is celiac, and we were exploring our options seeing what we could share. I was stuck between the burger (no bun) and the fish tacos, but was told that the burger itself had gluten in it. So I decided on the fish tacos. They were out of them. Argg! I decided to just go with the burger, and my girlfriend went with the Korean Pork Tacos. My meal was actually realllly good! The burger was a little overcooked, but that's how I like it. Their fries are awesome. Our drinks (a slushy gin & tonic and a slushy peach vodka drink) were also super delicious. I probably wont make a point to come back here, but for a quick bite and drinks it was just what we were looking for."}
{"text":"The only reason this is getting two stars is because of our waitress, Haley G. Drinks were promptly delivered. She checked up on us a few times and made sure our drinks were abundant. We waited approximately 45 minutes for the spicy tuna roll, ridiculous. The roll was deep fried and chunks of spicy raw tuna on top. Most of it fell off as we picked the piece up. We shared the Rustic Italian Pizza, the banana peppers interrupts the flavour of the pizza itself. Most pieces were not fully cut so there was a bit of tearing the pieces apart. The wife had the loaded burger, bland; fries, stale. They did follow through with no red onions . I had the Mustard & Dill Salmon. Great cook on the salmon; small bone army the very end, I would take the tomatoes off the dish, they had a fishy smell being on the same plate. I would give this rate them a 3 but with a total wait time of an hour for the entrées, can't say I'm happy at the least."}
{"text":"Moxies at this location is pretty good. I got the Sirloin medium rare with the baked smash potatoes. WOW loved the baked smash potatoes. Done perfectly with lots of flavors. The sirloin was cooked very well. 

I also love the ambiance here. It was interesting why the kitchen extended to the center of the restaurant. Service was not bad here. Parking is plentiful."}
{"text":"Leaving a short and simple review.  Skip the apps, skip the dinner, get a drink if you prefer, but make sure you go for the white chocolate brownie dessert with ice cream, share it with your friends if you don't want to feel guilty about afterwards."}
{"text":"I've come here a couple of times with some friends, usually for dessert, because their White Chocolate Brownie is to die for. 

A little bit of a long wait on a Friday night but the service is usually great!"}
{"text":"Great service! Very good food!!! Good looking staff! ;) I tried the steak salad and mushrooms soup, just great! Really good restaurant."}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to go to the Moxie's inside Fairview Mall for desserts/drinks after the movies. I've previously been to two other Moxie's (Yorkdale's and Scarborough Town Centre's) and this is the first time I've been inside the one at Fairview's. I was a bit apprehensive about going to Moxie's for dessert because my previous experiences at the other two restaurants were not amazing. However, all my friends raved about the white chocolate brownie so I had to go there to try it.

When I read their dessert menu, I was enticed by their sticky toffee pudding because I love sticky toffee pudding but I settled for the white chocolate brownie. For $7.99, I think it was a bit pricey but not expensively unreasonable.

The white chocolate brownie was topped with two scoops of vanilla ice cream and whipped cream. It was really good! Of course, I would like the actual brownie to be a bit more moist, chewy (that's how I like my brownies) and warmer. But nonetheless it was good. I also really like how they integrated \"real\" chocolate (as in normal brown chocolate) into the white chocolate brownie. Surprisingly, the brownie wasn't overly sweet.

Would I come here again just for the white chocolate brownie? No. But I would come here again to try the sticky toffee pudding!"}
{"text":"I came here recently with a friend for dinner.

We started off with some honey garlic chicken wings. Although we both hated getting our hands dirty (don't know why we ordered wings!) we both enjoyed the dish. It also came with a side of carrot sticks and dip which I finished off (my friend is not much of a vegetarian).

He ordered a burger with a side of fries and I opted for the penne toscana. The burger looked rather dry because the only condiment was some ketchup. Also, he found that the fries were too salty. I couldn't really judge because my penne was salty to begin with. Although the penne toscana was on the salty side, it wasn't a surprise to me since there was Italian susage and bacon in it. I really enjoyed my pasta and it was a good portion too!

I don't think I've ever had a good meal at Moxie's because either the food tasted bland or it came to the table cold. However, I must've ordered the right thing because it was a very enjoyable meal with great company."}
{"text":"The food here is okay like at most Moxie. I got an appetizer that had seared rare tuna on a cracker. It was very refreshing. It wasn't done perfectly (which I've expected) but it was still good. Then I skipped straight to the dessert tasting trio. The cheesecake was normal, the sticky toffee pudding was too hard and the brownie was perfect. If you want dessert, just order the full size white chocolate brownie. 

As for the service... It was really bad. Our waitress could not be found. It got so bad that another waiter basically took over for her. It took forever to get our ice tea refilled, to get a dessert menu, to place our order and then to get the bill. I know what you're thinking, it was probably busy and they're just overwhelmed. No. It was winding down and there were empty tables everywhere. I can't say that I've ever had the perfect experience at this Moxie so this experience is no difference from the rest."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend for dinner on a Sunday night. There was no wait, we were seated at a large booth in the lounge area. Service was great, our server was very friendly and checked up on us regularly. Food was good, would've gave 5 stars but it's a bit pricy for the amount of food that's given. We both ordered the Chicken Madeira Rigatoni ($20), food portion was kind of small, I found that I wasn't really full after finishing my meal and could've kept eating if there were more in my bowl. We ordered the White Chocolate Brownie for dessert of course, that has been and always will be delicious. Overall my experience was good, just a bit pricey for the serving sizes, but maybe it was just the specific dish that we ordered."}
{"text":"Like all Toronto I only go to Moxie's when I exhaust all the other options near me. Now with that said, it's damn right consistent and as delicious as I expect a well known chain restaurant to be. I had the calamari and steak dish with the stuffed baked potato, to be honest it was what I was craving atm and I was pleased but not blown away- the steak could have been more flavourful. Had an awesome dining experience though, Diana was a great server, shout out to her!  

Definitely recommend the wine Malbec Trapiche it was smooth and palatable great choice with the steak!"}
{"text":"I don't know why anyone eats at any Moxies. I think Calgarians have just become accustomed to the lack of decent restaurants and have accepted the blah, all-the-same food that is typical of all the chain places in town. However, Moxies is the WORST....They have just tried to dress up sub-par food with nicer decor. I have had the misfortune to eat here 3 times in the past year when my group from work goes somewhere to take someone from the group out for lunch. The menu is typical of all the chains in Calgary, but the food itself and portions are terrible.

On the previous 2 occasions I had salad... Once the beet salad and the other time the \"champagne\" strawberry salad. It was like someone threw a SMALL handful of green in a really big bowl and tossed in a few other things. For $13-14 they're making a killing because they were both really small and nothing remarkable.

The server who had our table of 12 was all of about 19 but thought it was cute or appropriate to call everyone (male or female) \"hon\" or \"darlin\". It just didn't work and she was too clueless to see that most of us either bristled or rolled our eyes at her silly pet names for complete strangers.

So today I had the salmon sandwich. Disgusting. I worked as a server for 5 years when I was in university and I would never have brought this plate out to a customer. It was a SMALL (3 oz total) piece of dry salmon on 2 half-moon pieces of flatbread which were then folded over into a triangle, and a tiny saucer of iceberg lettuce greens. Lame. For $13 I could get better and cheaper food from a grocery store deli. 

In the sandwich was a piece of lettuce, 2 big slices of tomato on each triangle and the tiny piece of dry salmon. Because Moxies is obviously trying to make the sandwich look like more than it is, they put these giant, pale slices of tomato in.

The server called us all darling or hon again when she out the food down.

But what makes it even worse is that these slimy pieces of tomato completely SOAK the plain flatbread so that when you try to pick it up it all falls apart in your hands and is just soaking wet. Disgusting.

I ate the salmon inside and abandoned trying to eat anything else of the sandwich. I picked at the \"salad\" but it was worse that a cheap salad in a bag kit from the grocery store.

When the server came back at the END of the meal to ask everyone how it was, (whats the point? Everyone is finished so you will hardly have time to order something else) and  I told her it was terrible, a soggy mess. She looked at my full plate and just said \"oh, sorry about that\". No more \"darling\" though.

I felt I had to go along with the group and not cause everyone to have to change restaurants but I can say I will NEVER go to Moxies again.

It's BAD food, WAY overpriced, and is basically anything you could make at home with a bunch of pre-made sauces. 

The server was capable but so annoying with the little pet names that just didn't go over.

I don't know why anyone would CHOOSE to eat there. The staff should be embarrassed at what they have to put out in front of customers. Never again."}
{"text":"Rant!!!

 Just went for dins with my friends at Moxies in market mall and what a fking nightmare!! The server was snarky as hell, I asked to start with a water and for dinner got a club sandwich. The sandwich had a MASSIVE hair sticking right out of it. Not sure how no one noticed it as it was super obvious. I was too disgusted for them to make me another or get anything else- so they take it off the bill and when I get my bill I see the water is $6.99?!? I had one glass and they didn't even provide a lid so I could take it with me. 

You think they would just take care of the whole bill considering I literally didn't even touch my meal, I immediately sent it back, but apparently they just do the bare minimum for their customers. Ill never return."}
{"text":"Went here a few times during a work assignment in the Toronto area.  Had mixed experiences, usually between 2 to 3 stars.  However, what makes this 2 stars is that most of the time, the staff here is too busy to take care of the customers.  In addition, I've had times where they aren't even sure themselves what the daily drink specials are, and end up charging extra for them.  This doesn't change the price even when you bring it up to them either, and at some point, you just pay the bill and get out.  There are usually many people here, even on weeknight evenings.  However, the service here needs improvement."}
{"text":"Their steak is amazing although the portion is a bit small. Pastas are great too and signature mosaic dip."}
{"text":"I had the best experience at Moxies this past weekend. Our server, Laura, was new but incredibly kind and attentive. We ordered the fried cauliflower and the rustic Italian pizza which were both super yummy (ask for the garlic sauce to go with the pizza, you won't regret it!) 

I ordered a glass of the (house) cab sauv without specifying which one and they brought me a $17 glass which I immediately recognized. Instead of replacing it, they let me keep the glass I was drinking and changed the price on my bill!

After leaving the restaurant, my boyfriend forgot the takeout container with the leftover pizza that we couldn't finish. It had already been thrown out but the manager, Jeff, told us he'd make us a brand new one no problem if we could wait five minutes! Left very happy, satisfied and impressed with the amazing customer service."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars
The servers are excellent, and the food is well portioned. My Sangria was a little strong tasting but that's not really a complaint. My steak was a little too cooked considering I asked for Medium, but it was still pretty delicious. Took WAY too long to receive our food for some reason, but overall it was a good experience. Wasn't the best Moxies I've been too, but wasn't the worst either. It's strange but I think every Moxie's is quite different for some reason."}
{"text":"Not to be confused with Earl's. I think Moxies is much more consistent. Nothing here has ever been disappointing, and more often than not, it's been impressive. But nothing has given me that \"wow\" as of yet."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch after Milestones informed us that it would be a 45-90 minute wait for a lunch table for 6 people at 3pm on a Saturday. I'm so glad I came to Moxies instead. For one thing, they have an infinitely superior dessert menu. The white chocolate brownie is my favorite. I had the crab and brie sandwich and it was worth every gut busting calorie. Probably not what I'd order on a daily basis but if you want to get down and decadent, this is worth a try. The blue zen martini is definitely worth repeating. Very clean bathrooms but the staff seem miserable, especially the women. Guess it's those shoes...can't be comfortable waiting tables in heels."}
{"text":"We went to market for a search for a laptop for me. Didn't find one. Fine. I was getting hangry anyways :p we opted to go for Moxie's as the bf has been craving it for some time. We were greeting at the door and offered the lounge. We sat ourselves and the booth I picked unfortunately had quite a bit of crumbs on the seat.

The boyfriend had heard through word of mouth that the moxie's chicken enchilada was really good. Therefore, that was our selection for the day (we got some dry ribs as well). Our server was super attentive and filled our drinks quite quickly throughout the meal. The wait for the enchilada was quite long, a good 25 minutes; the food came warm at least. 

I found the dry ribs to be under seasoned and tasted heavily of oil. No real complaints or complements for their chicken enchiladas either. They had plated chips with the enchiladas, so we had something to scoop up all the left over sauce and cheese on the plate.

I personally don't mind eating in the lounge, but the bartender throughout our whole meal spent a majority of his time chatting with two girls at the bar and actively eating from across the bar with them. Not the most hygienic practice... probably won't be getting a drink from here anytime soon."}
{"text":"The staff here was friendly for the most part. However the food was overpriced for the value. Every order was brought out wrong and it took a substantial time to receive it.  I will never go back to this location and it ruined my opinion of moxies. It ruined what was a great evening. I wouldn't waist your time or money here!"}
{"text":"I had not been to this location of the chain before, although I have visited Moxie's multiple times in multiple provinces. Well, apparently, their name has changed and they are now M.. just 'M'! That is what the sign says... 

I recently was part of a party of ten people who complained that Moxie's has lost its Moxie and so they won't go back due to a lack of sexiness (true story), which is ironic because I ended up here with a girlfriend today. She really likes the place and she has a point that the décor is nice, prices are right and apparently they have a nice patio in the summer.

My waitress was Ivana who was a bubbly, fun and polite waitress. She was a nice server to have. I ordered the steak salad and found it good, delicious and not overdressed/drenched. It could use more meat however. The proportion of lettuce to meat was excessive, but over all it is a recommended dish. The lettuce felt fresh, the meat was medium (wish there was more) and the cheese tasted great. They do not have a variety of waters, which is reflected in the menu which is also limited! They need more variety. Speaking of which the pecan salad is gone.
Finally, all menu items list their calories, which is really useful. I know the government forced businesses to do it and I am glad it did. I can make better choices now."}
{"text":"This was both an embarrassing and funny group lunch...

First thing you need to know is that there are only two of us girls at our department at the office. It is a male-dominated group. 
Second thing is management occasionally treats the office to lunches and dinners as a treat and the staff discusses where to go for an hour in advance...
So, in advance of our group lunch the VP asked where everyone wants to go and to no ones surprise Earls, Cactus Club and the Duke pubs were popular choices...why? The women of course.... someone suggested that we should change things up and go to Moxie's which apparently has \"top shelf\" \"10/10\" models in super short skirts and mini dresses, so on and so forth (lol - and we girls are just listening, reading the emails that are going back and forth and laughing) and our VP thought it is a great idea because he has always liked Moxie's and so it was decided....

First, this Moxie's is newer, has a very nice front entrance and similarly nice interior. it is spacious and comprised of different sections. One can sit in the dining or lounge sections...
We ended up in the dining section and the hostess efficiently rearranged things and moved things around and placed the group in the centre of the dining section across from the bar with no fuss.

Unfortunately for the group the hostess was dressed in a regular cargo pants or something, which is just fine if you are there to eat and focus on food and the team let that pass, but when the waitress also showed up wearing pants the team was openly groaning and making jokes about it, which is the embarrassing part. I am 99% sure the waitress heard the guys complain and loudly discuss with each other that the waitresses are disappointing them and are in fact looking... boring or something. It was embarrassing and funny to have the waitress dropping off menus and overhear half a dozen guys complain that Moxie's is not good anymore and has gone downhill. Wow. Anyway, the waitress was professional and pretended not to have heard a thing and provided good service. To tip less... Apparently, the uniform at the restaurant is black pants even for the girl behind the bar, which was a topic of conversation.

Apparently, the team won't be coming back, but what about everything else? The washroom was clean and well stocked. Like every other Moxie's I have been to it was modern and well designed. There is a fake fireplace at the entrance and the lights are dim.

The food was what you expect. The surprises or original creations are rare but they are happy to customize and make substitutions for you. I had the taco pokes and was disappointed because they had no taste whatsoever. The tacos shells were lined with something green (pesto perhaps?), but were it not for the hot sauce container included it would have been plain vanilla eating... speaking of the hot sauce container it was a nice touch sitting on the plate - assuming it was clean. See my photo. The Tomato Bisque soup was average, nothing special and could have used a little more taste. The waitress recommended drinks' special and I think the team didn't want to linger or stay long any more so passed. No special menu items were available or suggested so everyone ordered different items.
Prices seemed average and everything on the menu has calories attached in parenthesis which is very good. We should all pay attention to it."}
{"text":"We chose Moxie's for dinner and were happy with the choice. 
Of all the ugly suburban malls and plazas the Interchange has the most spots for parking despite the number of restaurants and a cinema, which certainly helps. 
The food was fine, the quantity just right, the girls well put together and very friendly. What I really appreciated is that any modification we asked for was accommodated. 
If I were to offer any suggestion for improvement of the menu it would be to bake rather than fry the seaweed chips served with the tuna and guacamole. The drinks were not watered down and we barely could finish our meals.
They do have an affinity for tuna it seems, with it appearing in appetizers, meals and salads, but that is fine with me since tuna is a favourite.
The atmosphere looks romantic and darkly lit on the dining room side, but the noise level is too high for it to be that. The lounge is a sports bar of course with millionaire jocks skating/dribbling/shooting for 800th game of the season on the big screen or whatever. Interestingly, Moxie's has achieved something difficult to do: its customers are man and woman, old and young and ordering everything from steak to Thai red curry. There is a corner of the restaurant and the menu that is suitable if one wants to check out the waitresses or have an anniversary dinner or have an old friends' reunion. That must have taken either some magical marketing or ingraining to happen, but it does.
The washroom was clean, but could be cleaner.
Kudos to the restaurant for its friendly and accommodating staff."}
{"text":"Note:  This place is pretty noisy, so be prepared.  Not a romantic place, more casual for drinks.

Came here for a dinner with coworkers and it was pretty busy mid-week in the evening.  Again, it was noisy, unless you're talking to the person right next to you!

Colleague ordered a bunch of apps and I think they try to do too many 'twists', re:  nori chips with guac, bruschetta with the tomato and cheese topping, both in separate mason jars.  We also had calamari, boneless ribs, and chicken wings.  I only tried the chips with guac, \"bruschetta\", and calamari, but none of it had much flavour.

I ordered the mustard salmon and the salmon itself was ok.  The accompanying veg (beans, tomatoes, potatoes) all were bland, yes even the potatoes.

Service was attentive because we were dining in a large party AND ordering drinks.  So of course, waiter came around often.

I wouldn't expect too much from the food, it's Moxie's.  This would only be a place I'd go if it was someone else's suggestion or a work gathering, but it's not on my list of places to dine out."}
{"text":"Bonus:  They offer drink/food specials after a certain time at night.  

Review is based on drinks-only, at bar.

Moxie's was the place known for scantily dressed waitresses dressed in black, right?  Well, it seems like black is still the dress code with plunging necklines optional.  

Outfits ranged from black tee + pants (standard, serious server) - black turtleneck + tight black skirt + opaque tights (sexy/conservative) - plunging black tank + black jeans (bartender, big tip$ $tatu$).

Seeing how there are no existing bars in Mississauga (unless it's a small neighbourhood joint), just resto-bars, we settled on Moxie's 'cause it was open late-ish and was a bit busier than Reds.  Crowd was also on the younger side in comparison to Reds.  

Prices were reasonable for the drink specials, but they were more juice-like imho.  No buzz whatsoever.  Ordered was a Peach Bellini + Rosé Sangria, Bellini was literally served within a minute of ordering.  How? 

Sexy bartender seemed to have an attitude.  The only thing warm about her was her exposed bossom, so do not expect a friendly welcome/chit-chat."}
{"text":"Food ranged from okay to amazing. Service was amazing. The last time I came here was in December to celebrate a friend's birthday. 

It was Monday evening and we didn't have reservations, but we got seated prompty. Most tables were taken. The ambience in the dining room is very date-like. We got a small booth for a party of 3. Their peach bellinis looked a bit childish with the gummy candy, but the drink itself was tasty. My group ordered the double cheese nacho, which is THE BEST nacho dish I've ever had. I recommend it to everyone who likes cheese or nachos. I ordered the prawn sirloin for myself, but I didn't enjoy it as much as I had hoped. It was mediocre relative to steaks I've had elsewhere. It had a seafood drizzle on it, but I didn't like it - I felt it was too oily and I couldn't actually taste anything but mild saltiness from it. The steak itself was well done, as I had asked (I know, I'm boring. I don't like seeing blood). The stuffed potato I had was also great, and very filling. My group seemed to enjoy their individual dishes too. I liked my friend's steak better than mine. She had mushroom sirloin, while birthday girl got pasta of some sort. She also got a brownie and ice cream on the house since it was her birthday! 

We had two servers since we stayed for a while. Both checked on us regularly and dropped some jokes. I don't recall our first (amazing) server, but I was reminded to write a review after I found my receipt. Anthony is the one who replaced our first server since the first finished his shift. First server, if you read this: you were missed, man. Wish I got your name because you were charming, funny as heck, and delivered great customer service. Anthony was courteous too. I'll definitely be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Very good...we started with the sushi cones (a must) then my husband had the red curry chicken which was ok (a little bland). I had the lunch combo with broccoli cheese soup which was good and the roast beef dip which was very good. Will definitely go back"}
{"text":"It was ok here the only great thing about this place is that they are a large enough space to accommodate 10 people. I had the chipotle chicken and I found the food a little too dry and salty to compensate for flavouring. I liked that the potion was very good, I basically couldn't finish the second piece of chicken and took it home for lunch the next day. 

Their drinks weren't very good. We ordered a pitcher of sangria that tasted more like juice then anything else. There was also too much ice and was watered down."}
{"text":"Jason was our server ordered a blackened chicken burger ( I don't eat beef due to religious reasons ) got a beef burger instead - on reporting this got a callous response which seemed like an everyday occurrence . Offered a Caesar Salad while waiting - in all took some 45 min before I get what I ordered . Patio has bees or wasps but the restaurant does not have candles to keep them away ? Won't be back again"}
{"text":"The food was tasty, although the food towards to small portion(their steak only 7 oz while others usually serving 10-12oz),I still prefer quality rather quantity. I guess that's their strategy to save you room for ordering appetizer n dessert which mean able to get more money out from your pocket. 

Suprise to see a proper healthy food choice from kid menu rather then all junk food like most other chain restaurant does. Parents, if you feel headache to find healthy choice for your lovely kid while dining out. This is a restaurant that you may consider.

Service was great, the hostess were welcoming n friendly. Our server Daniel was professional n treated us well. For a fine dining experience with an affordable price. For sure will come back."}
{"text":"Food is decently good, I had the steak sandwich, and service as usual is excellent, the only thing was that the food took forever to come, and my order was wrong but the waitress sweetly apologized, offered me a complimentary salad, and took my order again"}
{"text":"They were very VERY disorganized. Why bother taking reservations if you don't reserve the actual table?! We called the day before to book a reservation for 7:30p and were seated at 8pm. No one apologized and we were ignored except when we kept trying to ask how much longer. How ridiculous. The food was good nonetheless (hence the 3 starts) but they really need to fix their hosting. Either take out reserving all together or reserve and treat your customers properly."}
{"text":"Soooo I work in the mall and ordered the chicken Alfredo penne. Picked it up and came back to work to eat it, and literally there were four pieces if chicken in it and barely any sauce. Would have definitely taken it back if I wasn't at work. Will check my dish before I pay the next time I pick one up, IF I do...disappointing."}
{"text":"I want to give a 4 stars for the food, and 0 star for the service, so I'll settle with 2.

After shopping for hours for a new winter jacket, I decided to take my family to Moxies for a quick late lunch before heading home. We decided on Moxies because we were just at sports check, and Moxies is right across from it. I asked for a pen for my brother to use for his drawings on those free \"game sheets\" that they have for kids. The front desk girl said to ask my server. So we were seated and I asked my server. She said she'll bring one right away. There comes the menu and our water. No pen. I asked again. She said she'll grab it right now. She came for our order after a while. Still no pen. I reminded her about the pen. She forgot so she just gave us her pen. LOL.

I've tried eggs benny at moxies before and it was very average. But I was really feeling eggs benny again, so I ordered it. Food took forever to come, even though the usually-jam-packed Moxies at Yorkdale was only 5-10% full. My benny was surprisingly satisfying. They were not out of the world amazing, or mind blowing, but they were good. I enjoyed every bite of it and mom did too. 

So we took out time to finish our meal. We waited for about 5 minutes - our server is nowhere to be found. She didn't even show up during our meal. We waited for another 10 minutes, I even thought she was off her shift and forgot to tell someone else that she has this table waiting. Then another 5 minute past..I was getting anxious so I decided to use the washroom and hopefully bump into her on my way there or back. Nope.

Finally after close to half an hour of just waiting for her, or for any server, she showed up.

:/"}
{"text":"Not only we had to wait forever for our food, but the food was terrible. The waitress was keep confusing the orders, and by the end she confused the bills as well. TERRIBLE!"}
{"text":"The new sushi rolls were unbelievably bland! I didn't even know sushi could have so little flavour, and the sauce is basically just flavourless grease with a tiny bit of spice and no other seasonings.
Okay, aside from that, this place is okay. I didn't finish my dry ribs as they were pretty bland as well. The calamari was decent. What I really DID like though was the short rib stuffed burger which I would highly recommend and which will probably bring me back here despite less-than-satisfying appetizers."}
{"text":"First time at thus location. Ordered fish tacos... The fish was little overcooked but over all its falovours were ok. They took too long bring our food but our server was nice."}
{"text":"Not a lot can be said about Moxie's that hasn't been said before.

Pretty standard \"upscale urban hipster-casual\" is what I'd call this place.

Not super fancy, but just fancy enough.
Prices are a bit high, but I suspect because they are attached to the hotel upstairs they get away with it.
I paid $18 for a Cob salad that was actually a \"wedge salad\". They just cut half a head of iceburg lettuce and piled some stuff on top. It's not that it wasn't good, but it wasn't great - and the size was not an entree. It was a starter at best. I ended up eating again when I got home. =(

Drinks are great when they are on special, but expensive when they are not.
I've been back since and they made my \"Old Fashioned\" with lemon instead of orange and served it in a Martini glass. When I asked what was up I got a terse \"that's just how we do it now\". huh.
Points lots.

My wife's Singapore Sling was made as a frozen cocktail and didn't taste like a SS.

Service is good, but somewhat slow for the amount of people that are ever in this joint. I've been on a few different occasions and I never see any more than about 20 people dining at once.

There are far better places to go for food, but if it's in your budget and it's close it'll fill the void in your belly."}
{"text":"I had lunch today at Moxie's.  They have a lounge side.  I sat on the dining room side.

I ordered the Double Stacked Turkey Club sandwich (minus the lettuce and cheese) with roasted baby potatoes.  It's been a while since I've had a sandwich and this was a good one!  The bread was tasty and soft and the bacon was indeed crisp.   The baby potatoes were delicious!

Spenser was my server.  She was friendly and took good care of me."}
{"text":"Gord and I had supper this evening at Moxie's Grill & Bar before the Toronto Rock game.

We both ordered Chicken Enchildas.  I got mine without guacamole or sour cream.  They were good and filling.  The chips on the side were really yummy!  I've gotten this before and would get it again.

Jessica was our server and took good care of us."}
{"text":"I took a couple clients here for lunch today.

I ordered a burger with bacon and mozzarella cheese and mashed potatoes instead of fries.

My order arrived and instead of mashed potatoes, there were sweet potatoes.  I hate sweet potatoes so brought it to the person who brought our food's attention right away (it wasn't our server).  As I was eating my burger, I realized that there was no cheese or bacon on my burger but didn't make a fuss about it.  The burger and mashed potatoes were delicious.

Two in our group ordered a brie and lobster sandwich and they said it was greasy (it's made like a grilled cheese sandwich) so they used utensils to eat it.

Just before our server brought the bill we'd asked for, he came over to apologize (it's the first time he acknowledged the lack of mozz and bacon) and said that I was getting a free dessert because of the mix-ups. I didn't want dessert so passed on it."}
{"text":"I had seminars to conduct in Brampton today and had lunch at Moxie's.

I ordered Chicken Enchiladas.  I'd never had one before ... they were good.  I'm not into sour cream or guacamole so I left 'em on my plate.

I felt like something sweet so ordered a White Chocolate Brownie.  The ice cream and whipped cream were good and I ate 'em.  The brownie was just okay ... it was kind of dry and didn't taste very chocolatey so I just ate a corner.

Melissa was my server and she took good care of me."}
{"text":"A friend and I had lunch there today ... it's the first time I've been there.

The hostess and our server were very friendly.  My friend and I hadn't seen each other for a while and the server let us catch up (she kept stopping by to see if we were ready to order).

I ordered the Coconut curry rice bowl (with apples, ginger + curry-buttered naan bread with chicken).  It was interesting as it had kind of a smoky taste.  The naan bread would have been better if had been plain.

The restaurant is in a wacky spot ... down the escalator in the basement.

It I was in the Yorkdale Mall and was hungry for a restaurant rather than fast food, I'd go back."}
{"text":"Tonight Gord and I met his childhood friends (they've known each other for about 50 years!!) and their wives for supper at Moxie's.

Gord ordered Mediterranean Shrimp & Crap Linguine and I ordered Chicken Enchiladas.  Gord found his pasta too spicy.  My enchiladas were good and very filling.

Sherry was our server and she took excellent care of us."}
{"text":"What can I say service and food are great. No matter which Moxie's I've been to..... It's service with a smile. Our Waitress Ashley made our experience even better.
My mum had the broccoli cheddar soup which she said  was yummy and some chicken wings. I thought the wings were a little over cooked and small, but she was fine with it. I had the beef venderloo..... Spicy and delicious. Make sure you!re hungry as it is filling. A nice glass of Pino Grigio and I'm a happy girl."}
{"text":"This Moxie's is located at the Yorkdale Mall, across from the movie theatre escalators. 
Taking a different set of escalators you arrive in a very well laid out restaurant away from the hustle and bustle of a busy mall. 
Given the choice of the bar area or restaurant area, we chose a booth in a quiet part of the restaurant.
Service was fast. Menu lots to choose from. 
I had the steak salad........ Truly delicious and the steak was cooked perfectly, medium. 
They offered a brunch menu which I think needs to be resurrected. Had a good time, our waitress was very nice. No complaints from me.
Oh I knew I forgot something...... Ladies wait to you see the washroom with a large plush chair and magnifying mirror to touch up your makeup. Washrooms were clean and quite modern. Just when you think you gave seen it all. Great spot to relax after shopping. Located at the entrance across from the movie theatre."}
{"text":"Moxies restaurant and bar. Great location to chill. Good customer service, our waitress was both  friendly and helpful. Food was hot and delicious. Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"This locations atmosphere is actually really nice since it's in the financial district, however no matter what one of day you go it will be extremely loud and will be very difficult to hold a conversation. The food is pretty consistent with other Moxie locations. I had the chicken alfredo with chicken l. It was extremely heavy and exactly like what I make at home."}
{"text":"We had a girls dinner here last Wednesday and the appetizers were great! Service was great and our dinners too my only complaint was the half price wine if you sky rocket the market price and say half off is it really a deal? Oh well was great to see my girls that was the reason we were there!"}
{"text":"Just ate Moxie's Yorkdale for the first time last night.  And I was pleasantly surprised with my selections.

We shared an appetizer of a dip with mushrooms and goat cheese with sliced naan bread (although it seemed more like pita).  (Sorry, the name of the dish escapes me.)  But it was really good.  Even after we ran out of naan, we were still scraping the dish with our forks to get all the dip.

As an entrée, I had the Mediterranean Calamari salad.  Very nice.  The dressing was light and tasty.  I thought the calamari might be too greasy, but it wasn't.  

Our server, Justin, was courteous and attentive, without being creepy.  (God, I hate servers who try too hard)  Justin was cheery and professional.

I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Great time seated on the patio-the beef vindaloo was absolutely amazing and I would return to order it again.  Service was great and staff was very friendly-perfect as it was across from our hotel.  We visited on a Tuesday and it was perfect for family dinner..."}
{"text":"I visited Moxie's again last night with a girlfriend and had a much better experience.
Our server Dominic was great, and we spoke with the General Manager, Mike and another manager, both were extremely friendly.

My friend and I ordered the Vindaloo and chicken alfredo. I enjoyed both dishes. The pasta was a little bland but definitely better than my first time. I think for my next visit I will give the lobster pasta a try.

I like the atmosphere of this place, the friendly servers, the comfy and intimate booths, and the outlet shops that are in close proximity to Moxie's.
Some things on the menu are a bit pricy but I was pleasantly surprised that my total was ONLY $21 for a pint of Canadian and pasta! Unreal.

For dessert, we shared the sticky toffee pudding. It was AMAZING. I think Moxie's definitely does dessert the best.
Overall, I had a great dinner and will definitely be returning soon!"}
{"text":"Ewww...one of the worst restaurant experiences I've ever had. I've been to Moxie's at Yorkdale Mall a couple years ago and had the worst experience there. Three years later, I thought I would give this place a chance to redeem themselves. 

I visited the University Avenue location thinking that being downtown, their standards might be better. I was surprised that they actually had seats a day before St. Patrick's Day. We were immediately seated which surprised me on a busy Friday evening. It was packed in the dining room but the bar area was quite crowded. It's very dimly lit. The music was your standard Top 40 with some throwbacks. The female washrooms here are quite open. It's not private at all and for a second walking into it, it felt like the guys washroom. 

Our waitress took couple minutes coming to us. I ordered water with no ice. From this first order, I had a feeling that it was not going to be a pleasant night. My water of course came with ice. It was sent back. I ordered a simple Caesar salad that came with no bread. I really love chicken wings so I went for the chicken wings with sweet chilli sauce. Some time later, my salad gets put in front of me - with bread. My chicken wings comes without any sauce. I sit and wait while my friend starts eating her southwest fried chicken burger. My salad comes back- this time with no bread. The wings are infront of me and looks delicious. I was disappointed before I began that there was no bucket for my bones and no wet napkins. Was I supposed to put my bones on the table? There was no extra saucer or dish for those bones.

I'm into my second wing, I notice it is pink. I tried another and decided not to eat those wings. It was definitely undercooked. The wings were not grand by any means in flavour. I return the wings and ordered a side of sweet potatoes. The salad was also very salty. Caesar is such a simple thing to prepare and I was definitely disappointed. It felt like a grade school level cook prepared my food at this point. This ruined my dining experience. However, the sweet potato fries were delicious. I really liked the dipping sauce. It was tangy and the fries were well seasoned and coated. I really enjoyed them. 

The server that brought my fries out apologized for the bad wings and indicated that they will take care of my fries. This made me order dessert. This was the redeeming dish for me at this place. I ordered the mini salted caramel pecan cheesecake. Hmmm, I could eat a whole lot of this cheesecake. I was surprised it came with three blackberries, peach slices on top and a raspberry reduction. I expected pecans but I was glad there was none. This cheesecake is a must for everyone to try. It was so rich and decadent. 

Overall, I would not visit here again. It was a bad dining experience and after those wings I was feeling queasy. I wish to thank management for not charging me for those wings and sweet potato fries. Also, it was nice that the waitress apologized. Definitely try the pecan cheesecake if you're visiting here but Moxie's is a no go for me in the future."}
{"text":"Now, Moxie's is a touch interesting. Part of the restaurant is in the atrium of the building and the rest is behind a glass wall with better ambiance. But, that atrium also shares the entrance to the Extreme Fitness facility. It's an interesting combo. So... ambiance here can be a little funky. However, the servers are great and very friendly. The menu is GIANORMOUS and filled with a little bit of everything. I had two different opinions on my last two visits regarding the food: first time...meh, second time...yum! So, maybe avoid the chicken burger. The side salad with feta and cranberries was great and just the right size. I've heard great things about the vindaloo...but with great indian food across the street, it's hard to compare. It's a nice place to go to before an evening at the Toronto Centre for the Arts, too. Right around the corner. 

Way to go, Moxie's."}
{"text":"We went to Moxie's grill and bar near Madison center for dinner. The restaurant is beautifully decorated and the service was very good.

I ordered the sirloin and shrimp. My friend ordered the  chipotle mango chicken. My steak came medium rare as ordered. The shrimp was pretty good. My friend was happy with her chicken dish.

The only problem with the food was that it was just okay. I guess that when there are 67 Moxie's locations, the food will become bland and boring. But for the prices that they charging, we were hoping for something special.

Would we go back? I doubt it since there are better restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"I visited this Moxie's location on June 7 for lunch and was impressed.  It was one of our first nice days and we got there early and chose the patio.  The service was excellent and the wait staff was very attentive but not overbearing.  Since this was a business lunch we were quite involved in discussion and we took some time to review the menu but did not feel rushed at all. When we were finally ready to order our food arrived quickly and without issue.

I have eaten at other locations and found the quality of the food consistent.  I love their steak salad and it was just as tasty here as in other locations.  The summer sangria was a nice touch for a beautiful afternoon on the patio.

I will definitely return to enjoy their patio again."}
{"text":"Brampton is pretty devoid of good restaurants, considering it's size and proximity to Toronto. You pretty much have to settle for chain restaurants or drive out of town - and that's where Moxie's comes in.

I've been to Moxie's 2-3 times in my life, and I'm pretty torn between 3-4 stars since the food and service is pretty inconsistent. However, my last visit to Moxie's was more positive than negative thanks to great service. The food? Inconsistent as usual. 

We had the beef vindaloo - decent and surprisingly filling, and the chicken enchiladas - I swear they took frozen, grocery store quality enchiladas, microwaved them, and served it to us?"}
{"text":"The food was okay. Maybe it was because it was a friday night, but I'm pretty sure the waitress forgot about my order. The cocktail I had was really good, the food was meh. It was a burger and fries and they were lukewarm when I got it. Everybody else got there earlier and said the food was good."}
{"text":"Pretty good atmosphere, great service, friendly staff. Food was average, but it is to be expected at a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"The servers were on-point and they anticipated my needs, the restaurant is spotlessly clean and the food was amazing - 5/5 for taste and presentation."}
{"text":"When we went, the restaurant only had a few business groups having after work drinks so we didn't have trouble getting a table.  The staff were all very polite but the music (although it was good)  was very loud and we had to almost yell to be heard.

For the appetizers, we got the calamari [with popcorn shrimp, crispy jalapenos, candied ginger, sriracha aioli & sweet chili sauce] and bruschetta [fresh seasoned tomatoes, baby capers with extra virgin olive oil & crumbled goat cheese].  Absolutely delicious.  I was apprehensive about the capers because other times I've had them, they overpower the dish but this time, they added just the right amount of flavor.  I was never a fan of goat cheese but I honestly can't even remember the last time I had tried it... it's amazing.

For our main dishes, John got the sirloin steak with prawn lobster butter, chorizo, baby potato & corn hash with chimichurri.  I had a bite of it and I wish it was what I had chosen instead.  It was delicious.  I have to go get steak for supper tonight because it was so delicious.  I had the lobster and prawn linguine [baby lobster tail & jumbo prawns in a rustic tomato sauce].  I had read reviews that it was too sour and they were right.  I understand that it is a rustic sauce but it was a bit too acidic.  I was full from the bruschetta so I didn't eat too much of it but I loved the lobster.

John got a cappuccino (they didn't have any chocolate left for a mochaccino) and the tasting trio (mini versions of our white chocolate brownie, sticky toffee pudding + salted caramel & pecan cheesecake, served with french vanilla ice cream).  He said it was delicious.

Overall, we had a good experience.  We enjoyed the ambiance even with the loud music and the food was tasty.  I just don't know if it is worth it for the price of the meals.  I don't think I would go back for a main meal but for drinks and an appetizer, it would be a great go to spot.  To see their full menu and a list of all of their locations, go to their official site."}
{"text":"My friend chose Moxie's for a late lunch today; I never choose or recommend to go to Moxie's so I was not really expecting much especially after my last visit (a different Moxie's location and a few years ago).  Upon arrival, we were warmly greeted and seated promptly.  The decor was inviting and modern.   I ordered the classic beef burger and added aged white cheddar and sauteed mushrooms, with a house salad as my side.  The beef burger was a good portion size and surprisingly decent - it was not a processed patty but rather a moist burger, hand-made in house.  The side salad was topped with a generous amount of dried cranberries and feta cheese.  I finished my meal off with a decaf latte.  Service was really friendly and lunch here today was a pleasant surprise."}
{"text":"Lots of staff, many of them unhappy, outnumbered patrons at Moxies this evening.
Some of the least appetizing food I have ever experienced. Street tacos that were made mushy by the slop that was placed inside were probably the low-light.
I can't think of one reason to return."}
{"text":"This location is great.  The atmosphere is fun, clean and the staff are welcoming.   We've sat in the dining room, bar area and bar itself.  Each area offers friendly and prompt service.  Their nearest competitor Jack Astors is always understaffed and you feel it as a result.  East Side Marios is gross, no other word to describe a badly managed restaurant which servers who hate life and food that tastes like its been microwaved.  My favorite is the Beef Vindaloo which gets you full without that feeling of having eaten too much."}
{"text":"After waiting for a table for some time we did drop in with a group of 6 guys. Great kitchen! Did order a honey garlic sirloin with mushrooms. It was very good. Everything was joke with this plate. The cappuccino afterwards could be a bit bigger. The waitress was also nice and the beer was good. Will try the Moxie's Grill & Bar chain more often."}
{"text":"Had written off the Moxies chain... but, decided to give them another chance - my issue is mostly with their Yorkdale location (Brutal place to eat).

Service here at Bramalea City Centre was excellent and garlic steak was probably one of the best I've ever had at a Moxies.  They were accommodating to substitute for more \"Heart Smart\" foods to go with my steak and the flavors were awesome!

I'd go back to THIS Moxies...but NEVER Yorkdale!"}
{"text":"Yum.  The Short Rib Burger was hearty, tasty and a great value.   Burger can be on the heavy and greasy so I'd recommend to accompany with either the side salad over the wedges, fries or sweet potato fries.  Great service and atmosphere.   Extensive menu.   Good to share entrees."}
{"text":"Moxies is Moxies - it's a chain and you'll always get consistency. 

As a location, it's great in the East Beaver Creek corridor with nice patio and friendly staff."}
{"text":"A great little Moxie's tucked away in the back of the Sandman Hotel. Expect the expected but welcome the location in a relatively desolate food area."}
{"text":"Drinks were great. However as a vegan I got a kale and quinoa salad (without the chicken) and was charged the full price of 20! Pretty high for just a salad. Besides that great location and friendly staff"}
{"text":"Moxie's is one of my favourite Canadian \"chains\". 

They always have the best service and the food is so delicious. On of the best things about Moxie's is how there is something for everyone - makes a great office party location or taking new friends out for a meal. Also, great for families since their menu is relatively kid-friendly and the atmosphere is not too fancy. 

I'd highly recommend all of the appetizers here - the wings are really delicious (and you can get multiple flavours if you ask). Confession: sometimes I go here and only eat appies (no shame). The one thing you must get though is their Asian chicken salad - the sauce is amazing and will leave you wanting more!

The drinks here (like most of these places) are on point and they have a large selection of feel good drinks. If you aren't feeling a fancy drink, they also have beer, can't go wrong with that. 

This particular Moxie's has some of the friendliest service i've ever experienced - the girls and gals here know how to do their jobs right and are really helpful and make the dining experience wonderful. Came here for lunch after a stressful morning and felt a lot better after good food and good company."}
{"text":"Came here on Valentines day, thought it would take forever to be seated cause we made the mistake of not making reservations. Fortunately the wait was only half an hour and I was very happy about it. It has similar atmosphere to all of the other mid tier fancy restaurants. I have been here a few times and was satisfied each time. The most recent time I came here I had their half rack ribs ans it came with potatoes. The flavour was great, they used a sweet version of barbecue sauce which was quite special. Although the portions was not that great for the price compared to other restaurants.

Drinks wise I am a fan of their white sangria. They also have a good selection of beer and cocktails etc just like all the other restaurants. I would point out thought their service was superb. At my most recent visit, our server, Klent, was awesome with a great attitude which made my stay at Moxies a lot better."}
{"text":"Okay service, but not many lunch options and not worth the high prices. Not likely gonna come back again."}
{"text":"I got half a teaspoon of ketchup with my burger and fries. I had to flag a waitress down, she then so generously brought me the other half. By then my food was cold."}
{"text":"It's Moxie's. You know what you're getting. Nothing spectacular. Ambiance - dark woods, low lighting. Nice enough. 
Our server, Ebony, was very sweet. Wasn't all that busy but looks like she forgot my sister and I while we dined. She didn't come back to ask if the food was to our liking. 
I ordered the blackened chicken burger. It was quite delectable along with the side of sweet potato fries. 
My sister finished off with their famous white brownie - which seemed to have been slapped on the plate from a distance. The dessert came to our table with ice cream dripping down the side. 
Again - nothing spectacular to note as it's Moxie's. Meh."}
{"text":"Went while staying nearby. Read the reviews and agreed with a previous reviewer saying give it a try. We couldn't have been more satisfied. Our servers name was Derek. He was fantastic. Had the Caesar salad and a Loaded Burger. Both excellent!  The manager even stopped by the table to see if he could do anything to make it better. We left impressed with the food and service. 
 So impressed that we stopped back two nights later. 
 Unfortunately totally different experience. Our server was a letdown. She seemed uninterested and not around much. Getting iced tea and a beer took forever. The club sandwich was just okay. The beef dip sandwich was just barely warm and the meat was a small portion and undercooked for my taste. I think the pretzel bun gave it a weird taste too. We accepted that the server makes all the difference. Unfortunately she really disappeared at the end and left us standing out in the lobby trying to track her down to get the bill and get out of there!
 My advice, check it out but try to have Derek for your server. And if you get a cute girl with incredible eyelashes...switch tables!  
 So five stars plus one dived by two equals three!"}
{"text":"I have to start this review with my waiter, Jack!!! I was so impressed by his service and his knowledge of the menu!!! If this guy doesn't love his job he is doing a great job at hiding it. And who doesn't love friendly service!!! 

The fact that's it's been months and I still remember his name!! Thank you for teaching me a few things and I'm sure I'll be back for the food and for the service.

I still remember when moxies first opened on the other side of this mall, the menu has matured since then and the location and atmosphere is much different more vibrant and more colors, very chic yet intimate.

The washrooms were clean, the water was hot, and it was cold out so perfect for those freezing cold hands.

Let's get back to the food. So I ordered the chicken pasta, sorry I forgot the name but thanks to Jack I know the history of this particular chicken pasta. the myth to the dish is that Moxies chef cooked the dish specially for beyonce the queen b herself. It was the Queens b's favourite dish allegedly. Jack also taught me that the pasta sauce was such a favourite at moxies they decided to make other things with it, like a burger with the sauce on it, can't wait to try it :) that's Def next !!!

Well I guess you can say I'm clearly loving this place. I shall be back to try more dishes, hopefully jack is working and can recommend some more great dishes."}
{"text":"Went on a monday for 50% off wings... Wings were okay, definately had better wings at other places. Service was good in the beginning, but near the end the server began to develop an attitude.

Ordered the chipotle, BBQ, honey garlic & caesar wings!"}
{"text":"Very conveniently located if you're doing some shopping at Scarborough Town Centre because it is one of the only restaurants outside of the food court that is directly accessible without going outside. Service is usually always good, the staff are very friendly and attentive. Moxie's is definitely one of the better chained restaurants in my opinion and if you're dining here for the first time you have to try their white chocolate brownie! It's a Moxie's must have after every meal!"}
{"text":"It was a simple and elegant time with my co-workers. The food was good. The service was slow. The drinks were ok. I think this place earns 5 stars for decor and being trendy. They also have an outside seating area. Its posh. The service goes with a 2 star. Finally, the food was 3-4 star worthy. All in all, not bad. I'd go again."}
{"text":"How would I describe Moxie's.....somewhat upscale, chain-ish eats for suburbanites. Having eaten here and at Turtle Jack's, I had a hard time telling them apart. 

I will say that Moxie's has a chicken/greens/goat cheese salad that is absolutely delicious. Servers are nice, it's a little overpriced and a lot nondescript. You can do better, but you can certainly do worse too."}
{"text":"12 of us came here for lunch on a Thursday at noon. I had the kale and quinoa salad with lemon vinaigrette (on the side) which had poached chicken, dried currents, toasted sunflower seeds and grana Padano cheese for $16. 

Service was great. The manager stopped by to make sure everything was going well. For a chain the menu and food is quite good. The salad was delicious and hit the spot. 

My only complaint is the music is a bit loud so it was really hard to hear people talking. Otherwise everyone enjoyed their food and we were out of there within 1.5 hours."}
{"text":"Good food, excellent variety of selection, and supreme desserts.  The environment here is a bit less professional than the Moxie's in Toronto.  In other words, the staff here is chosen for different assets and could use some more clothing. 

Ok place for dinner if gentlemen only.  I had a female colleague that was mortified by some of the behaviors of our waitress and can not possibly go back there with her again.  

Try the white chocolate brownie!"}
{"text":"Wonderful atmoshphere and pleasant staff.  There is an excellent variety of choices on the menu and all seem to be prepared with quality in mind.  I can't express strongly enough how amazing some of their desserts are, especially the white chocolate brownie ala mode.  

Great place for business dinners."}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere and staff very friendly. Food was good but a little on the pricy side."}
{"text":"White chocolate brownie and their Mexican bulldog drink(which I'm not sure they still have) are the two reasons Moxies is a go to place for either a sweet tooth dilemma or stress relief dose of supersize tequila anything! Yasss to their dim lit dining area for sexy dates and some girl time catch ups.

So on to the Fairview location experience.
This review is based on a near death experience/accident (incident in the summer 2014) courtesy of their flying patio umbrellas that weren't secured properly. Patio was perfect for ice cold beers despite the strong gust of winds that managed to wisp the heavy umbrellas like feathers off your fedora.

After a few more failed accidents we witnessed, one umbrella almost wiped out an entire family of 4, the manager then finally decide to nonchalantly come out of his cave and address the issue at hand. 

The waitresses had quite the acrobatic challenge tryna yank the umbrellas and at the same time avoiding peeps shows with their cute mini skirts. The proper thing to do here (manager pls note) is to give at least complimentary apps or a free drink to soothe nerves rattled in a supposedly safe environment? Apologizing repeatedly for an obvious hazard induced from improper installation of these umbrellas seems unfit for management role."}
{"text":"My boyfriend, sister and I were starving on Saturday after a long day. We were trying to think of a place to go to and decided to drive to the Colossus area and decide there, so we ended up choosing Moxie's. 

There were quite a few people waiting inside, but we were told the wait wouldn't be long and that was true. We literally waiting about 5 minutes and were given a really nice booth in the back. Our waitress came to see us pretty quickly too.

I ordered the white peach Bellini and both my sister and boyfriend ordered Stella's. My drink was very good, but probably not strong enough which was fine. The Stella's were massive! 

We decided to share the calamari app and the kale and quinoa salad. I was so hungry that I forgot to take pictures (rookie mistake), but I can tell you that both were very good. The calamari wasn't the typical round-shapes pièces you usually get everywhere. They were still battered and fried, but the pieces were much larger. The dipping sauces were very nice. The salad was very simple, but also very refreshing with its lemon vinaigrette. Definitely recommend both.

I ordered the honey garlic sirloin, my sister their shrimp linguini and my bf the shrimp and sirloin meal. My sister's pasta looked very good and tasted quite good too. The only thing that I would complain about was the lack of shrimps in her pasta. There was literally one large shrimp, a few tiny shrimps and some lobster. Again, I tasted it and it was very good regardless of that. 

My steak was very nice considering it wasn't the greatest cut of meat. It wasn't chewy at all and was done perfectly. The honey garlic glaze was yummy. My bf enjoyed his meal as well. We both agreed that ordering the baked potato with mashed potatoes inside was the best idea. We devoured it!

The atmosphere was really nice, the service was great and the food as well. I would definitely come back here again!"}
{"text":"This was the last day for Winterlicious and my friend and I decided to go to Moxie's at Scarborough Town Centre. It was a great environment and not too loud to hold conversations. Jessie T. Was our waitress and probably was off her game today, but was very helpful and mindful of our time spent their. She was very positive and remembered to fill up our lemon water or sprite. The food was great and simply delicious. I don't mind coming back again, because it seemed like a fun environment to enjoy dinning with friends."}
{"text":"Apart from the nice ladies in slim dresses, the food has no importance, rememberal flare.

The Nacos, we're fantastic, the cheese was plentiful and the chicken on it was very tender. The burger, was just.....a burger; featuring all your normal burger toppings. The bun which was served on was kinda hard and flakey. Nor was that all, when our waitress brought our drinks her hair was in the drink. With out knowing, she gave proceeded to the next table and gave them their drinks, with the hair. 

Moreover, You should just try a restaurant in the new food court."}
{"text":"I am already a huge Moxie's fan because of how seriously they take gluten allergies, but my last visit was positively outstanding! My fiance and I stopped there for dinner and thought we would start with an appetizer. I asked the waitress what I could have (since I have a severe gluten allergy) and she immediately brought the GM, Jeff, over to our table. Jeff checked out everything and said that the mosaic dip would be safe, but because I couldn't have the pita chips that came with it, he would sent one of his staff over to the grocery store to pick up some rice chips. I couldn't believe how accommodating he was - blew my mind! He made sure we were taken care of in terms of drinks, and even took our orders for us.  We didn't have to wait too long for the dip with the rice crackers, despite the impromptu grocery store trip. and our meals were delicious. We left as very happy customers and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Another night, another Moxies. I've been to several locations and the consistency never fails. 
My friend and I went for dinner and I ordered from the gluten \"friendly\" menu. This is the restaurant saving their ass if you get sick ;) I had the mango chicken with lemon quinoa. It was nicely prepared with avocado, bokchoy, tomato salsa and a bit of mango sauce. It was on a bed of carrots that tasted really bad, but sometimes that's just the way carrots go. The portion was quite big and everything (aside from the carrots) tasted great. My friend had the backyard burger with lettuce instead of a bun and she really enjoyed hers as well.
In terms of dealing with my food requirements, they were pretty great about ensuring my food was as far from being cross-contaminated as possible, which I really appreciated. They always ask to see whether it's a preference or an allergy so they know how careful to be. 
Our waitress was okay. For the most part she was prompt but her politeness seemed forced. She could have been having a bad day though. Regardless, another decent experience at a decent chain. I'll probably be back."}
{"text":"It's been over 40 minutes and we still haven't received our order. The servers hardly come around to re-fill on drinks, and we're spending most of our time looking around hoping someone comes by. Would NOT recommend! Too bad, I remember their service being a lot better!"}
{"text":"Good place to hang out with your friends, but have in mind no serious talking since you cannot hear them at all. That's why I gave it 3 stars. The food was good for the money, and the waiter was helpful. I will go back to hang out with people who I don't want to talk to or tired of listening to."}
{"text":"I like Moxies just not this location. TBH the food sucks!!!!!! We got calamari that was soggy. They switched up their recipe and it wasn't very good at all. We also got the bruschetta which was okay. I wasn't impressed with the entree. Got the blackened chicken burger which I had before at another location and absolutely loved but this time it was very salt and almost inedible. Even the French fries didn't taste fresh. 
On the plus side, the bellinis are still amazing!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Moxie's for dinner. After checking out their menu, I saw they claim using only 'fresh ingredients', locally farmed meat and fish, and local fresh produce... I was super hyped for the Ahi Tuna Salad with avocado, fresh herbs and topped with cashews...YUM!!! Sounds amazing right?

What I was delivered appeared to be a tossed salad packaged from Walmart. Wilted greens, no avocado, dry sliced radishes.. it was bad. So I sent it back. I said to the waitress, \"if it's not fresh I'll order something else! It's okay!\"... I was assured the next one would be fresh... 

So already it was  an undesirable dinner. My boyfriend had his meal hot at the table and I did not... Oh well for our \"dinner date\"... couldn't even enjoy our meals together. 

Second plate... the lettuce was a little crispier, still dried out radish, wilted greens, and tiny little slices of avocado (1/4 of an avacado sliced in 4)...so I ate the Ahi tuna and avacados and sent the rest back again. 

The manager came and apologized, said the salad was \"fresh bagged\".... (what does that even mean ?) dinner was not great at all.... and the master chef's name is clearly printed on the menu next to the \"fresh\" claims.. poor guy. They did credit my bill even though I ate the Tuna, but still would have rather had a great meal and paid full price. 

Good ambiance good music nice dining room and good service...! Food sucks tho. 

The Waitress was very nice and the manager was very nice too!!! So for service they got 5 stars! as for Moxie's??? 1 star. Fast food crap... go to Wendy's."}
{"text":"The food is okay.  Wait staff is friendly and try to get you served right away.  I like how it is opened on Sundays earlier then most restaurants."}
{"text":"As you can see in previous reviews by me I am usually very content with food and service. I am an easy pushover. 

This place tonight really stunk:

1.  Short rib appetiZer was deep fried and breaded, really gross and not what was described on the menu

2.  Calamari was tiny and chewy and had a spur tasting yogurt sauce

3. Salads were good and fresh

4. BBQ chicken and ribs had too much spice on one breast and almost none on another. 

Service was slow, water never replenished. Always pushing for more drinks. 

I do not recommend this place as there are plenty of better options."}
{"text":"My go-to safe spot. Service is always great and food is always what I expected. I usually go and enjoy half off glass of wine on Monday nights. If you want a more intimate setting I suggest being asked to sit in the dining room. If you're with friends and want to enjoy your meal while watching the game the lounge is perfect. Love this moxies location!"}
{"text":"Found a bone in the Salmon, it could of killed me!!! I have suffered from neck cancer, and always want to eat healthy.... the waiter recommended their \"New Salmon\" dish, lemon herb salmon
fresh salmon, ancient grains, lemon herb sauce + fresh seasonal vegetables 26. Sounds great and healthy right?  First bite, I pull out two bones from my mouth.  I almost choke on it as I have no saliva due to radiation treatments, if I would of swallowed it would of been \"911\" call for sure.
I didn't want to make a big deal as my friend from Florida was visiting, the manager came over and covered me a Drink ( which I would of thought was free) but wasn't and then what else I wanted to eat.  I really didn't trust Moxie's now being my first and last experience, so I said Czar salad please.
When the bill came all that was taken off was my car salad...... Talk about bad customer service, nothing else .  I admit it was disappointing, as a waiter I would of spoke to my manager to take care of the bill."}
{"text":"I had given up on Moxie's a long time ago, but we tried to give it another go with my mother-in-law. I wish we had just given it the heave-ho instead. We sat in the lounge because the hostess seemed to prefer us there. We were seen right away by our server and the new menu items by Chef Alex Chen seemed promising. For some reason though I went with my chain restaurant staple - the beef dip. How could you go wrong with a beef dip? Well Moxie's accepted the challenge and served me a fatty, gristly portion of what I think may have been roast beef. I am not sure as my first few bites were spent trying to dig the gristly grossness out of my mouth as it was unchewable. The au jus was tasteless and grease floated lazily on the surface. The bun was past it's date and was so stiff, I gave up and eventually tried eating the meat, cheese and mushrooms with a fork and knife. The caesar side salad was ok but a bit too saucy. 

The server finally asked to re-fill my soda after I pushed my empty glass closer and closer to the edge of the table. She also asked my husband if he was finished and waited patiently for an answer despite there not being a single portion left on his plate. 

I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Moxie's is great!  For a nice dining experience, go to the left (dining room).  For a more rowdy atmosphere, go to the right (bar).

Got their Mosaic Dip w/ flat bread for app... so good!  Our server gave us more complimentary flat bread for the dip.  Portion is great!

For main dish, I got the Ginger teriyaki rice bowl w/ chicken.  Portion was good.  A bit too saucy but overall... tasty.

Dessert, we shared the Tasting Trio; White chocolate brownie, Sticky Toffee Pudding & Salted Caramel & Pecan cheesecake w/ vanilla ice cream.  Plenty to share for 2.

Service here was great.  Food was overall great! it did take a while but we didn't mind."}
{"text":"For my meal I chose a medium rare Sirloin steak with prawn lobster butter and replaced the baby potatos with lemon quinoa. I was very satisfied with this steak! It was soft and juicy and was very delicious! Also choosing quinoa over the potatos was also a good move as the quinoa was also yummy. The whole plate itself was yummy!

Serivce was fine. It was still early in the evening and not a lot of people in the dining area so service was prompt. My server was friendly, polite and helped accommodate my request for quinoa.

I definitely enjoyed my steak here. The rest of the week i ate steak in 2 other areas (one of them being an actual steakhouse) and those steaks couldn't come close to this one."}
{"text":"There is Demetres, Baskin Robbins, DQ, and then there is Moxies. We stopped into Moxies for dessert after rib fest. We did share one app (just to not make it weird that we stopped by just for dessert haha).

The Poke bowl can be shared with 3 people and It comes with nori chips. The dish is very light and is also tasty.

For my drink i decided to go with their lemonade. It is sweet and refreshing.

For the main reasons why we were there. I had the sticky toffee pudding and my friends has the white brownie. The toffee pudding is sweet, tasty, and came with a scoop of butter pecan. The brownie was warm, gooey, and yummy as well. 

You cant go wrong either dessert but the brownie is the fan fav. If you do get these dessert, enjoy!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants! 
They have a lot of gluten and dairy-free options that taste delicious.
The servers and manager are very accommodating with other food sensitivities I have and ensure i always enjoy my experience."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed. Dinner service was okay. Ordering seemed kind of rushed, as in the waitress seemed she was in a hurry when I asked what she recommended since it was first time. Anyways, the entrée was horrible. Cold, dry, and the \"sautéed\" mushrooms platter made me really sick! (And I eat mushrooms on a regular basis). I also should have read reviews before coming here. Almost every U.S. based yelper has a negative review. Note: don't call yourself an American bar and grill when Americans don't have a positive review!"}
{"text":"Moxie's is one of my favourite canadian chains to go to the reason why I thought of taking my out-of-town friends to this location (closer to their hotel). but alas, I was disappointed with my choice. The decorations were okay but I found it a bit darker than others. to make my point, we couldn't post our photos in social media because we can barely see some of our faces. I think I should have gotten a hint at the fact that there was a lack of dinner crowd at 7pm. Everything else was just so - so. I didn't have a bite at my hubby's burger so I can only speak for myself. I ordered the Mushroom Sirloin Steak medium rare. Very sad because not only was it chewy but very tough to swallow.It definitely ruined things for me. In the end, we opted not to order desert in the wants of leaving early. I could name a few more restos I would have wanted to take them except my friends were a family with 3 very cute exhausted princesses. In the end, I had to go hunt myself a server to pay the bill (yes, you read right and of course I couldn't run away with cranky little ones)"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful experience at this restaurant. Had dinner with a close friend, got seated in the lounge, in a circular booth, very comfortable and spacious for two but can't beat being comfortable! Had awesome service...quick, responsive and great menu suggestions. Had the steak salad with a spicy tomato vinegar based salad dressing, thought it would be a good idea to compliment that with the Asian salad dressing too...great little tip there!  Had the aha tuna starter, beautiful tasting appetizer. It comes with fish based chips (skin) and the dip is aha tuna (raw), with onions, avocados and lime...great healthy snack! Great venue, lots of TVs, sports, casual dining with wonderful atmosphere. Would def come back, drinks/apps/menu/ late night menu deals too! $$$ 5/5"}
{"text":"It was a Saturday night and the lounge was practically empty which was a rarity but it was a summer evening.  My friend was surprised we got a parking spot close by as it's usually full.   I liked the booth we were in as it was large and there were some TVs around and we could see the bar area and the rest of the lounge and out the windows.  

The menu was different but it was probably a few years since my last visit.  I had a late lunch and wasn't too hungry but nothing on the appetizer menu appealed to me and I didn't want to have an entree.  My friend ordered one of her favourites, a salad with steak, and I just went with a staple, clubhouse sandwich.  The food didn't take long to arrive with being a slow night.

The sandwich was pretty high and big but the side salad was tasty and a good size.  I ate that and I ate a quarter of my sandwich and took the rest to go.  The sandwich was as I expected and nothing special but filling.  We stayed for a few hours chatting and the server was getting off work so we paid our bill but we didn't fell rushed.  She was attentive and great to come by to check up on us but not annoying.

The washrooms are nice with a fireplace, TV, and seating area!"}
{"text":"Bad food and poor service, if it wasn't for the attractive wait staff they'd be out of business"}
{"text":"Nice, quiet place to enjoy a relaxing meal. Our server, David, is one of their newer additions and he is very nice. The manager who stopped by our table is also very nice. I enjoy the red Thai curry bowl with its creamy, mildly spicy sauce and variety of different vegetables. My son enjoys the kids meals. Parking is plentiful. We are regulars and always enjoy our time here."}
{"text":"Wow, Moxie's has changed since I worked there in the early 00's. The menu is completely different and pricier, instead of a poor man's Milestone's like it used to be.
Usually I get poor, slow service at Moxie's, but this location had acceptable service, I was with a party of 10 that grew to 20 and they were very accomodating. Our food came out all at the same time, so that was appreciated. 
I had the steak salad (which was one of the only things I recognized from the old menu) and it was great as usual. I'm a big goat cheese fan, and they didn't skimp on it like a lot of places do.
My friends had the curry rice bowl (loved it), and the steak and baked potato (steak was better than one you'd get at The Keg--didn't have to chew it like bubblegum). It was a shame that we went for dinner since I saw the lunch menu and wanted to try more on that than what they offered for dinner.
Seems like the food has improved but with it, the prices have gone sky-high...I can't really afford to go here casually anymore which is a shame."}
{"text":"If you are a guy and good looking, this is your place. The girls that work here are very good looking but if you are a woman and foreign they will ignore you and treat you very poorly. Too bad because the place is cool but all the girls are very mean. I did not tip because of her attitude and she throw the recipe at me. What a bummer for a beautiful place and a beautiful city. Somebody needs to show these girls the meaning of hospitality."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal here and I can't complain about the service either.  However, Moxie's gets four stars in my book strictly because of their white chocolate brownie.  I have joined others in road trips across town to various locations just for this."}
{"text":"Visited Moxie's early Sunday afternoon and it's pretty chill compared to Mon-Sat, quite nice out on the patio.  There's a Sunday brunch menu and the Eggs Benedict was quite good.  We also ordered the veggie burger but upon the first bite, had to spit it out - something was wrong with it - either stale or old but I'm sure it was a one time thing and they did let us return it. 

Overall the service was awesome and would go back for other dishes."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Even better than other Moxies. 
Service however was inexcusably bad.
Dining alone tonight, I elected to sit at the bar. There were about 5 of us being served by a woman who may in fact be the slowest employee I've ever met. 

Once the delicious burger arrived, I had to specifically ask for a napkin. 

Not a busy night, but terrible service. 

Definitely won't be sitting at the bar again..."}
{"text":"I just left the moxies in Pickering because the service was despicable- we waited a couple of minutes in front of a hostess (young girl blue tank top) who could not look up from her things for even a moment in the few minutes we were standing there to either seat us or tell us to seat ourselves. Seated ourselves on dirty unwiped tables (no choice bc they all were), no server for about 5 minutes and we were probably 2/8 ppl in total in there  and believe me they all saw us. Thank goodness for the Jack's across the parking lot...."}
{"text":"Choose Moxie's on the recommendation of my cousin. Turn out to be the cosiest after party spot ever. Met Keesh best host ever. Food was delicious. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This restaurant is new and has comfy booths. Food is typical Moxie's you can get elsewhere. They were promoting this Alex Chang special menu, which included a Korean taco. I wondered what that would be? I've never heard of it before. 

I ordered a chicken sandwich with soup and salad. It was a healthy lunch except the chicken sandwich was a bit salty. Chipotle soup was okay."}
{"text":"Reading the reviews, it sounds like they have a problem with groups... for 3 of us who wandered in on our way to the aquarium, it was a solid dinner and a good value for the price. Jasmine was an excellent server, the food was nothing fancy, but good, the atmosphere was what you'd expect in a downtown restaurant. I don't think I'd make this place a destination, but it was good for what it was - a basic dinner that was part of a night out (though not the main attraction)."}
{"text":"This Moxie's in in the middle of hotel airport land. It's right behind the Sandman Hotel & across the street from the Hilton Garden Inn which is where I was staying. We had a quick dinner here on a weeknight & the place was pretty busy. I had the spinach salad with champagne soaked strawberries & salmon. It was really good. The others I was with also liked their food. Service was kind of brusque as the waitress was really busy. But the music, the decor & vibe of this place is cool. It was an enjoyable dinner."}
{"text":"I come here often because I live in the area. Food is good. However, usually takes 10-15 minutes before I get greeted in the lounge. Also, they ran out of wings on their Monday's wings night. :("}
{"text":"Service was fantastic when I visited for brunch today.
My friends arrived 5 minutes before brunch ended at 2PM, AND I was still on the way. They happily took the orders before 2PM and even waited for me to arrive before they served my dish at 2:20PM.

The waitress checked on us every once in a while, food was made nicely. Although I wish my sausage hash brunch meal came on a bigger plate, as I had little room to work with. But it was delicious, definately coming back!

P.S.
The chairs in the lounge area are super comfy!"}
{"text":"Came here for a friends birthday dinner on a Friday evening. My friend made reservations for 12 and we were still waiting on 3 friends that were running late. Once we were seated, it took 30mins for a waitress to even come by and ask if we wanted water.
After ordering, it took an hour for all of our foods to come. The place wasn't too busy as it was a holiday, but having to wait an hour on foods like burgers and tacos was ridiculous. 
I ordered the fish tacos and I was disappointed. The fish was soft and dry. The fries weren't crispy and got cold really quick. 
I don't think I would eat at a restaurant located in a mall if it wasn't for my friends birthday."}
{"text":"I have been to several Moxie's locations in Canada. The Calgary location was really nice, service was attentive, and food was prepared well.  This was the first time I had the Beef Vindaloo. It was very good.  Not traditional vindaloo, but very well executed the way they presented it."}
{"text":"Friendly staff with consistently good food.  This is a chain restaurant, but it is nice to see the same level of service is across the chain, at least to the several locations I have been to across Canada.  I really like the Vindaloo Beef."}
{"text":"This place is great for anything be it a date, large group or just enjoying a drink or two. I like their Peach Bellini and Bruschetta. The location is perfect just steps away from subway (Yonge & Sheppard)."}
{"text":"I have never been disappointing from the food in this place doesn't meter what I ordered it was at least an OK plus. The drinks are great (recommended to Moxie-size it every time).
During lunch its kids friendly and dinner its a good place to hang out with your friends."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, food is good, nice location. I said good but not great. the appetizers have really bad chips going with it which sort of ruins the greatness of the dish itself. I had the steak and it was done great but there were a few pieces that were a lot tougher than the rest. Still tasted good but not a pleasant surprise. These are just small points however in an otherwise great place."}
{"text":"I'd compare this place to the cheesecake factory; great for some people, not so great for others.   Our server was good and there was nothing bad about the experience, but the food is as fresh as it could get for a large chain restaurant.  I'd go back if someone wanted to go, but I'd never chose it myself."}
{"text":"I would not waste my money here. 

I ordered fish tacos. Although I may have misread the menu, I expected crispy battered fish, but they came as just grilled fish, so I was disappointed. Overlooking the initial disappointment, the whole plate arrived cold. Like barely warm to the touch and that includes the fish. The fish tacos were served with a very creamy coleslaw, no guac, no salsa, nothing remotely mexican about this menu item.  And all of it had zero flavour. Just tasted like watered down mayo in a flour tortilla. But I guess it isn't a Mexican place. Pass.

The husband ordered the thai red curry with chicken. It arrived even colder than the tacos. We sent this one back since it honestly felt like it was straight out of the fridge. The flavour was ok. We have had better. But I guess this isn't a Thai place. Although we sent back the order and had to wait for them to prepare a fresh batch, we received no apology. 

The server, while pleasant and friendly enough, was way too busy, and it took us a good 5 mins before we could even complain about the food being too cold. It took ages to get her to bring us the bill after we were done. It was a Friday night though, so I expect it to be busy (not sure why, it really isn't worth going back to). But the whole experience was a bit too unpleasant for us. 

Honestly if you are going to offer menu items that are not typically 'canadian' or 'american' at least try to make them taste good and serve them hot from the kitchen. Perhaps if we had stuck to burgers and fries we might not have been so disappointed? I am not going back to find out.

The drinks were perhaps the only redeeming quality, perhaps that's what everyone goes for?It most certainly isn't the food.

Overall the service and food leave much to be desired. You can do much better for your food dollar. Try Jack Astors or Canyon Creek in the area."}
{"text":"This space is very big(2floors) and beautiful decor , its nice and modern but also feels very cozy and inviting at the same time, wood and exposed plants and big windows. Service is hit or miss , i've been once before where it was slow and then again when it was good. The drinks are decent , their cozumel margarita and traditional margarita were both good (Better option to ask for it with the ice to be slushy instead of in cubes). The food is good too , their fish tacos and their street tacos are both tasty and a good size (it is a portion of 2 tacos that come with fries). Their tuna Poke is a little small and is more of a tartare with avocado and fried seaweed chips on the side. However , it was tasty and fresh. The prices are a touch high for what you get but its not unreasonable especially compared with some of the other options in the area. I would definitely come back here, its a fun ambience and an overall enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"The fact that this location exists right by the LRT tracks should warrant a mediocre review at best however, that's not the only reason. 

Walking past the storefront to the main entrance, there was human vomit that had not been addressed by staff - kind of gross if you ask me. 

I have been here on 3 occasions now and would like the last to be my last. 

We have had veggie burgers here - which were dried out and so-so...but that's really the only veggie option other than salads. 

I ordered a caesar salad with the dressing on the side last time, and that was decent. Calamari here is ok, there is a decent wine list. 

A lot of business types here at lunch drinking and meeting or whatever they are doing. If you do arrive at a busy time, service is deeply crippled. 

Anytime I have ordered a cocktail it didn't arrive in the typical version of itself. I would stick to beer and bottled wine/easy cocktails. 

Like I say about most chains, fancy fast food. 

They have ice cream for kids and they use dry ice to make it look like it's smoking or whatever....woo oooooooo. Chicken fingers/fries and generally the standard fare for kids at any restaurant - bordering on child abuse.......

Relatively clean, the washrooms are a total pain in the butt to get to at the very rear of the restaurant and up a bunch of stairs."}
{"text":"So far, service in the lounge is horrid.....and to continue with this thought, took 15 minutes to get a menu. 20 for a drink. 

Food was ~ my god, I can't even smash it that badly because it was only nachos. How do you screw up nachos? If you would like to know, go to Moxies. 

Had 3 Caesars, asked for extra spicy. Even said \"look, I mean really spicy, I'm not being a jerk, but every time I order spicy in this province, I get nada\". Server giggles and laughs and says that I'll get spicy. 

Did not whatsoever. On round 1 or 2. 

We were over a barrel that day and had to stop - it was that or starve because the equal food casualty \"Shark Club\" is the only other resto there. 

There were actually only 3 people at the bar. Us two, and two tables of four. 3 people on duty. Mymymy."}
{"text":"Went here on Friday night cause I was to lazy to cook and wanted to go somewhere good I take boy to ( under eighteen ). Always though movies was pretty steady and haven't been to this location for couple years, not a bad renovation, looks pretty good. Not a busy Friday but they were sort staffed only two servers and as it got busier there sure let the guests know about it.  Started off with salt and pepper ribs, pretty greasy fatty and ??????? Boy had a burger with just ketchup, his regular, not easy to mess up but even. He did not finish his soggy frays and poor burger. I tried the dried chicken and overdone rib combo , poor pick on my part, Moxies, ur going downhill......."}
{"text":"Went on Friday Oct 16, arriving around 6:30pm.... Greeted by maitre d' who asked if we had reservations and was told no we didn't. He then asked if we were there for dinner or to see the baseball game... We answered dinner...Seated in a booth for 2 with my date... My date ordered the Mushroom Sirloin with extra side of broccoli and a Heineken, I ordered Lobster and Shrimp Linguine and an 8 oz glass of white wine and a Gumbo soup to start.... Drinks were delivered by another waiter who proceeded to place the beer on my side of the table and the wine on my dates'.... He would have been better to ask which was for who as opposed to assuming because I am a man that I ordered the beer...When the entrees were brought to the table the server asked which was for whom... Had coffees and split the White Chocolate Brownie, floating in chocolate sauce and covered in whipped cream for dessert.... Food was average, service was acceptable, decor is somewhat upscale.... The privacy of the booth was nice compared to some other restaurants...All in all a little pricey...."}
{"text":"Went there during a 5 à7 after work. Terrible food presentation and taste. Service was slow but it was during peak hours. No ambiance just loud clubbing music. Calamari was overcooked. They added deep fried red ginger thrown on top. Not impressed.
Why are the waitresses skirts so short? Women are being sexualized. I left feeling ripped off and angry by the women's uniform. The  place is a generic American food chain restaurant. Would not come back."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend for dinner on a Friday night.  Initially they told us we would have to wait about 20 minutes but it turned out to be much shorter so that so things started out right.  The restaurant is  a little on the noisy side but every other aspect of the experience was fine.

There is a good variety of dishes here.  My roast beef dip was pretty good.  It was very salty though as it was served on a pretzel bun.  The portion size was just right for me and I had no trouble polishing it off.

Alcohol is a bit overpriced but they often have specials so keep an eye out for what those are.  I didn't try any of the desserts but there were a few that caught my eye.  If you're in the North York area then this is definitely a solid option for dinner."}
{"text":"Delicious.... from the salad to the dessert.  Waiter was wonderful.  The chef came to the table and chatted. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"It was super quiet for a Sunday night. We came around 7 and it felt like the place was closed. I was very pleased with our seating area. I was on a date and we got a seating area where we were not disturbed by the other guests it was just two booths and the other one was empty. We got our food on time, barely any waiting. Our waiter checked in on us every couple of minutes. I deducted 2 stars because of the food. I never liked Moxie's. I've been here twice and never seemed to be pleased. I had the shrimp pasta. It was a bit too salty. Three stars to the ambiance and waiters."}
{"text":"So me and my friend here went here on Nov,19,2016, now I usually come to Moxies at this location, so as soon as we enter the restaurant there is no one at front desk to assist you to get seated, me and my friend wait there at the chairs this was around 12:45 am, so after 10 min of waiting no one was still there to help us, finally after getting fed up, I decided to see if I could get a server to find someone who would be able to get us seated, around the corner I see the front desk girl chatting with another of the co-workers inside the booth siting down, so while we as customers were waiting at the front of the restaurant, waiting to be seated, she was just chatting with another co-worker clueless, that we were even, she finally saw us and arrived, I asked her that we would like to go in the dinning area, she just said that our kitchen is closed for the dinning area, while I could clearly see orders coming from the kitchen and people still in the dinning area, its a shame because I actually like the food at the restaurant and have been a loyal customer, but thanks to this terrible service i will not be coming back again,"}
{"text":"I'm pretty surprised at all the low ratings. Then again, chain restaurants probably don't do very well in downtown Toronto.

Came to this Moxies location for a Paint Nite event. The decor is great, very similar to other restaurants downtown. Definitely didn't feel like any other Moxies I've been to. 

I can't say much about the food and drinks, as I used to work at a different location...and we only ate nachos and wine. But the ambience itself was great. Lots of seating available with 2 huge bars and televisions surrounding the place.

Would return if I'm in the area to try out some new menu items."}
{"text":"Horrible service, we were on the patio for 20 minutes while 2 different servers just walked by us.  it was me and my family

They kept seating people and not assisting 

This just happened and I'm very disappointed,even after the hostess approached the servers no one stopped by"}
{"text":"....ambience great..great food.. service well not so much...wine list really!!!!
.the waitress had great personality and a wonderful attitude ...however she just didn't know how to be a server ....
so 5 stars when you train your staff.....and figure out the wine list...."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in the area I always try to make some time to come to this Moxies. Food is always great, different drink specials everyday, you can't go wrong. Some friends decided to meetup here today for happy hour and I noticed they added \"street tacos\" to their menu. I asked my server Krish for his honest opinion, and when he said its better than the food trucks in Cali that he had, I had to give it a try. I can say he must have been extremely honest because those tacos were phenomenal, which matched the service he provided to me and my friends tonight. Thank you Krish and Moxies Fairview!"}
{"text":"Been coming to this location over 10 years . Visited today with 9 other people just didn't enjoy the experience. Everything seems to be very disorganized. The way our tables were managed ( we got half the table and had to wait 15 minutes for the other half ), how long it took for the food ( 1 hour), the taste of the food ( had the dill salmon - it was dry and the taste not great ), my sister's shrimp was not cooked well and we had 5 order of brownies and one was not warmed up . Moxis management you need to get your act together. Never had so many things go wrong at one place !"}
{"text":"Though moxies is not my favourite restaurant in terms of food (the food is pretty average). I would have to say this is my favourite location. It is fairly new (about 3 years old) and has a beautiful layout and decor. Every time I have been, the staff has been very personable. Moxies has a great selection of drinks and I love their white chocolate brownie. But I am still waiting for that menu item that blows me away and keeps me coming back for more."}
{"text":"Very busy on a Saturday evening and a small waiting area but friendly and enthusiastic wait staff along with good food."}
{"text":"Is it really necessary to have the wait staff where skirts so short that you can almost see their butt cheeks? I guess if I went to Hooters, I'd expect that but this isn't Hooters. The service is almost cold but it's efficient (we're a table of girls and our waitress didn't flirt with us like the other table of guys). The food was really lacking. The portions were big but they were bland or they were overly salted. I'm not a fan. I had the arctic char. The fish was boring and the mash potato was bordering on watery. There are much better chain options than Moxie's."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times now and my experience has been consistent

Usually the waitress that I get are always in a rush and haven't been very helpful in terms of suggestions with what to order.

The bruschetta never seems to disappoint me. I got the white chocolate brownie hoping it would give me that sweet satisfaction but never does. The brownie itself is always cold when I get it and seems stale.

My friends and I now only go to this location if there's no other option."}
{"text":"Given that it's one of the few decent options on the Fairview Mall plaza, this restaurant can brag about a nice patio, even though you're still sitting within several meters from all the cars driving by on the parking lot. The food was nothing impressive. The wings were small, with virtually no meat on them. The dessert (french toasts with strawberries) was a joke. Their definition of \"strawberries\" is a thin slice (1/5 of a strawberry) per toast. The service was good though. Our server was friendly and attentive. This place is also quite pricy too, without adequately compensating with quality of food."}
{"text":"I have not been to moxies in a while but decided to go with a friend this past Fri night. I had the lobster and prawn linguine, it tasted fine until I ate the piece of lobster that was already pre removed from its shell (even though they left the empty shell in the plate), I just thought it was the sauce on the lobster that I did not like as the prawns tasted fine.  I do not have any allergies. Pretty much 15-30 mins after I felt sick and did not even make it out of Scarborough town centre yet and puked many times. Unfortunately I will not be returning due to this experience. I have called and spoke to the manager and she indicated the lobster should have been served in the shell and will be checking with the chefs that day. I hope that no one else has to experience this."}
{"text":"This was honestly an amazing restaurant experience, it was my first time going and I have to say it was well worth the drive down! My friend and I only went for drinks and an appetizer but god it was good. The wait staff are so friendly and fast, as well as the food was amazing. We had the mosaic dip, which has a bit of a kick to it but its a nice gentle one ;) lolz the pita bread that came with it was absolutely amazing, well baked and seasoned. My new favourite thing! 

The restaurant itself is gorgeous! Black marble walls, comfy booths that (which I always check for) had enough space for the two seaters and wonderful bench private areas for couples. The lights are so interesting and well placed because even though it was 10:30 pm I could actually read my menu lolz. Unlike most restaurants where the lighting is so low you cant see anything. The chandeliers and decor was so modern and beautiful, loved the sphere spiky ones.

All in all an amazing experience, it is however on the pricey side but you do get what you pay for :) btw love how they marked their prices: ex 13 3/4 meant 13.75 such a cool idea, making the cents part a fraction. Reminded me of school and it was kinda a cute take on pricing. 

Def try this place out! I know I will def be going back :)"}
{"text":"We went there because the keg was packed, sat down, ordered a wine. Their waitress brought us the glasses, we waited for at least 20 minutes... she didn't have the bottle opened for us but empty glasses and we haven't ordered our food yet.
The buzzer from the keg went on, which was supposed to be a 30-40minute wait, still no drinks showed up.
We were very unhappy with the wait and we left the place."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday with my little sister after work. We came for some post work drinks and an appy.   I used to work at the Moxies in r-hill years ago and always liked the restaurant.  Never been to the fairview location but thought wed give it a try...(we figured its the only place in the mall w booze lol) we were sat in the lounge on the high tops by the manager. The server we had was really sweet.  Ordered white wine and the white sin sangria. My sister loved the sangria they also have red but it's a slush ice type of drink. We ordered the chicken tenders and asked for it as an app, which they used to do but she came back apologizing saying they don't do that anymore.  Totally fine! We ordered it as a meal (I'm a veg so it was for her) but got a side salad for her side which I had.  Moxies side salads are the same as a rem, very good not just carrots Tom lettuce but they add cheese and cranberries too.  
Overall good experience, will come back when I'm at the mall :)"}
{"text":"As a restaurant close to work I finally decided to try the Moxies in Shawnessey. The menu is decent UNLESS you are gluten free/wheat free, have sensitivities or allergies really of any kind, and do not mind being embarrassed and hungry. 

Our waitress insisted that the manager come and talk to me about my allergy which he nearly argued that I could not be allergic to \"just wheat\" (which I am) but all gluten. Everything I picked, including the obligatory salad list appeared to be cross contaminated. Before I even inquired he told me that I couldn't have rice noodles either because of cross contamination. I ordered iced tea. After basically being called to task by a defensive manager, not getting the waitresses attention for even a refill of iced tea I did not even get an acknowledgement that ordering from their menu was tough or anything hinting at an apology. Actually I was told that I hadn't received a refill of my drink because the bartender was \"flighty\" and didn't know how to make it. 

I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Sweet Potato Fries were soggy. 

Beef Dip is made with a pretzel bun, which means it can't soak up the au jus.  Which isn't a good thing for something called a Beef Dip. 

The need to Moxie size your beer to get something resembling a normal sized pint is annoying."}
{"text":"Appetizers were great, especially the calamari. Didn't try the sushi cones or the bruschetta but they were both finished with no complaints from my friends.

Unfortunately, my chicken chipotle quesadilla was very dry. There wasn't much chicken or cheese in the quesadilla, so that didn't help it go down any better. I don't remember there being any chipotle flavor either. The salad had a tad bit too much dressing. My friend also complained about that as well with her salad. 

My friend said his fish tacos weren't that great either. My other friend got the shrimp and lobster linguine and the lobster tail was miniscule. Overall, only a few of my friends actually enjoyed their main course. Probably won't be back unless it's just for drinks and appetizers."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with my cousins. It was a Thursday. It was $5.99 Martini night. I forget how much of a savings that was, but it was not that large. We had nachos, bruschetta, and sweet potato fries for appetizers. Between 6 people, it was enough. For dinner, I had the beef vindaloo. It was pretty good. It wasn't amazing. I think I should have added some chili sauce. Our server was okay. He seemed a little out of it at times, but I guess it was getting more busy as the night went on. Looked like a popular after work place to be. Had an outdoor patio with smoking. I don't remember the prices, but it was pretty average for a chain restaurant bar/grill."}
{"text":"Yet another decent bar for after-work drinks with colleagues. I don't usually frequent these sorts of places (as they all start to look alike after a while) but when you work in the Core it ends up being a fact of life. 

The thing that I do like about this location is that there is an upstairs and downstairs, and in the warm months, you can sit right outisde. Granted, you're overlooking a CTrain track, so I'm not sure how nice of view that really is, but hey, at least you're outside. Anyway, with two levels, tons of seating, and pretty good service this place earns its three stars even if I found everything else to unremarkable. 

The menu is a typical bar-food with a fancy twist and the drinks aren't anything to write home about. There are specials every day (with wing night on Monday and 1/2 price wine on Tuesday) including some (limited) hapy hour drinks. Although, yes, you do need to enter near the CTrain, inside the establishment is clean, well-lit and not very noisy.

I got an appetizer and a few drinks, so I can't comment too much about the food except that the sushi cones were good (although all together unremarkable.) I probably wouldn't go here for dinner, to be honest, as I wasn't really impressed and the prices are fairly high.

In general, this place goes on my list of decent places to take work contacts, but beyond that I don't think I would go again. In general, I would probably go back to James Joyce over Moxie's for that sort of atmosphere anyway."}
{"text":"Let's get into it. Waited 10 mins to get seated, waited 30 mins till we decided to just get up and leave. Was asked for drinks and never seen our waitress after 30 mins, and when she seen us she didn't even ask if we were ready, my nephew and I were ready to leave. And went to another restaurant where we were treated with respect and enjoyed the other restaurant! 

That was my experience at this location, other locations were fine, horrible customer service"}
{"text":"I came here with a group of friends and the first thing I noticed was how beautiful the women here were.

Anyway, the restaurant is fairly dark, makes you feel a little bit more secluded from the other tables in the restaurant.

Service was decent. Our server did a really good job when he was around, but he was not around enough. When our food got served, he would come and ask us how the food was and how we are doing before we could barely swallow our first mouthful. But after that, he would disappear for quite some time.

I ordered the chicken enchiladas. I really liked it. I enjoy mexican styled food so it's hard to mess it up. you get 3 enchiladas, guacamole, sour cream, and salsa. If the entree was able to remain heated enough to keep the cheese nice and stringy then i would've loved it even more."}
{"text":"i ordered a steak with a side of roast potatoes and veggies, cooked rare. and i got just that. food tasted great, but the portions are just a tad bit small. i left feeling i had eaten JUST enough. which for me is ok, but my appetite has grown considerably smaller in the past year. normal guys my size would probably need 2 orders."}
{"text":"I've been to Moxie's Grill & Bar many times and this is the first time I'm writing a review.  I've always had great experiences at Moxie's.  The servers are always nice and polite. The food I would say is above regular pub/bar food standard. For this visit I had the Asian salad with chicken and sesame dressing. I washed that down with a sticky toffee pudding.  Both dishes were amazing! My friend has the kale and quinoa salad with chicken and she loved it as well! The other times I've came I've tried the calamari, dried ribs and sushi cones and bruschetta these are excellent choices if you're looking for appetizers.  Mains I've had the roasted chicken or salmon are great choices as well.  Also on Wednesday nights which I frequently visit is half price bottle of wines.  Amazing deal. This is a great spot to meet up with friends for food and drinks. I highly recommend Moxie's."}
{"text":"Aaaaamaazing. Jamal our waiter was the best waiter I've ever had. So personable, knowledgeable, and funny! Food was good. Service was fast. Greeted promptly. What more do you need?"}
{"text":"When we arrived around 8 pm on a Saturday night.  It looked busy and they told us it would be about a 25 minute wait.  45 minutes and 2 drinks at the bar later, we were finally seated.  It took our server a while to make his way over to us (we chalked it up to a busy night).  When we did finally order and our food arrived, we had neglected to receive cutlery, so there was another delay.  My dining companion had requested mayo for her fries, but had to remind our server of that request.  All in all, the food was mediocre, the service wasn't great and the ambience left much to be desired."}
{"text":"I normally go to the moxies in Scarborough. This location is quite different in terms of portions sizes and wait times."}
{"text":"Stopped through here for a late lunch and we will definitely be back. The servers are so nice and informative and the food is yummy! The place is modern and swag. If you like good food and pretty servers you will love it here."}
{"text":"Came here for my buddies bachelor in Montreal! At first, we were all thinking .. All the way to Montreal and we go to Moxies?! And with 11 dudes?! 

Well, we definitely worked with what we got :) and guess what? It was an awesome night! It takes a certain individual to serve a bunch of loud boys with drinks. Luckily we got Kim the bartender ... Of course she's working double duties as our actually server. Throughout the few hours we were there, the server was very tentative. Even when Kim went onto her dinner break, we have temps who came to our table.  Food came out just about right and everyone gotten the meal together. I've ordered the shrimp and lobster linguini, it was a moxies sorta tasty, one thing to compliant about is the lobster tail I've gotten. It wasn't big. Actually the tail was almost as small as a crawfish :) and a bit over cooked.  However, really we were there for drinks + have a good time.  

Highlight of the visit: Kim for being so user's friendly!

{"text":"Haven't been to this location in quite a while, mostly due to previously underwhelming food/service. Only came back here because it was conveniently located to friends whom we were dining with. Reading some of the other recent reviews, many sharing similar experiences of poor service, I should have pushed a bit harder to move our dinner to another restaurant. 

FOOD:

The \"Loaded Burger\" I ordered was fair, though not really worth describing much in detail. Lots of toppings, though the patty itself was a bit bland, and the bun became soggy quickly after the sauce/juice soaked through.

The \"Bite of Brownie\" really gets closer and closer to an actual BITE-size every year, yet the price keeps steadily rising. Given that this little dessert is nothing more than a warm piece of cake with vanilla ice-cream on top, it was even more disappointing when the dish came out completely cold. Not sure if the kitchen forgot to warm it, or if the server left it sitting on the counter too long (probably this, as the ice cream had already started to melt as well).

SERVICE:

I tried to give the server a chance to redeem herself, but her shoddy service kept disappointing to the point that I was quite irritated upon leaving. A brief list of service pet-peeves by server Elvire M. that ensured that I will not be returning to this Moxies location:

1) She did not make any effort to accommodate additional guests when they arrived, requiring us to seek out and move chairs over to our table ourselves. 

2) When asked what side-options I could have to accompany my aforementioned burger, other than fries, Elvire stated that I could have the soup of the day. She did NOT mention, nor was it mentioned in the actual menu that ordering the side of soup would require an upgrade charge. This is one of my biggest pet-peeves when dining out, as it is not about a few extra dollars, but transparency. 

3) Our meals arrived rather slowly, and the server made little effort to check in on whether we needed more water or anything else.

4) Upon receiving the bill, and addressing Elvire's failure to inform me of upgrade charges, she proceeded to claim that she did tell me. Given that I, and others in my party, could not recall her mentioning anything whatsoever about said charges, it was even more insulting when the server stated that she had a \"different opinion\" on whether she informed me or not. The lack of accountability here was appalling...

5) As is common for many, our group remained at our table for a few minutes after receiving the bill, to finish our drinks/desserts. After informing her that I did not require change, and that I was not yet ready to pay my bill, Elvire still proceeded to come by two additional times to rush me to settle my bill.

VERDICT:

Will definitely not return. The food is mediocre, and the service atrocious."}
{"text":"I'm okay with Moxie's. It's no Milestone (which i prefer), but the food is decent for a nice night out with girlfriends. Not to say that groups of guys don't flock here as well, with all the sexy waitresses dressed tight black clothing. 

Generally, Moxie's has a good cocktail selection and a nice range of food choices. If the prices were better, this place is a four star. However, your food has to be really really amazing if you are going to $16 for a salad. 

Overall
- great ambiance
- aesthetically pleasing servers
- decent service
- good food
- way too high price-point

This location has a good patio, as long as you dont mind looking into the parking lot."}
{"text":"Service great! menu fantastic. Decor sharp. Entrees beautifully plated and presented. So why a poor rating?  Prices are very high (as they need to be for the hip and trendy) but my dinner was disappointing. Despite the pressure to order the most expensive steaks and appetizers from our waiter, I though I'd go for the roasted chicken. Healthy, right?  Nope. The chicken's rubbery skin was coated and batter-fried. All of it (including a carefully molded rice disk) and sauteed vegetables (unintended stars of the meal) had little seasoning-- so bland that salt had to be added, which is so rare. But a place like Moxies, I've come to realize after many business meals there, is more about looks and appearance than about taste and value. So, sadly, I'll probably go back."}
{"text":"Although I am not too keen on scarborough town centre the moxie's here is pretty nice with friendly staff"}
{"text":"The service at this location is terrible. For the med-bread appetizer, you can ask for more bread for no charge. We asked for more bread and our server just rolled her eyes at us and walked away with attitude like they did not want anyone to know that you can ask for more bread with the appetizer. For the price we are paying here I would have expected higher quality food / service, but you just don't get that here."}
{"text":"Never bothered to check-in to Moxie's because honestly? I'm here SO often. Meet up with bff to gossip over wine? Moxie's. First date? Moxie's. Drinks with new friend? Moxie's. Drinks with visiting friends? Moxie's. 

Tuesdays are their half-price wine nights, which probably explains half of my experiences here. I love the atmosphere, the staff is always friendly (though not too knowledgable when their wine list changes and I have to tell them what's new). 

Their food is nothing to rave about, although their burgers are always spot on, and so is the penne toscana. Staples. But not where I go for good food. I go for their wine list, their muted lighting, their drink specials!"}
{"text":"The bar is great, and so is the dining area.  No complaints about the service.  The entire restaurant is quite dark, but the decor is elegant.  I enjoy the food here, along with the drinks.  I only wish the prices were a bit cheaper, that would get it a 5 star.  Most nights expect a wait of at least 15 minutes.

{"text":"This Moxie's had a good old-fashioned feel to it. The wood finish, the beautiful light fixtures and pretty servers all add a touch of class to what it is, really, a chain restaurant born in Calgary.

But that's what makes Moxie's its own. The United States has TGI Fridays, Applebee's or PF Chang's. We have Moxie's, Earls and Milestones. 

The food is standard and it is good. The desserts, in my opinion, are outstanding. One star off because Moxie's no longer has the warm sticky toffee putting cake with vanilla ice cream that used to melt in my mouth and caused me so much happiness and joy. I must say that the chocolate cake ($8) topped with vanilla and filled with chocolate syrup lava is a close second, but I'll miss the toffee cake for sure. 

Today the beef dip ($15.75) was satisfying with its pretzel bun over sliced beef, sautéed portobello mushroom, caramelized onion and Swiss cheese. The beef dip was the right consistency, salty and warm.  

Steak sandwich ($17.75) was also good, cooked to a proper medium and so were the mixed green salad's. The lettuce burger ($15.50) is a great option for those who are gluten-free or want to eat less wheat.

$65 before tip for three people. Not amazing value but not bad."}
{"text":"Amazing service and management! I recently had a horrible experience at a different restaurant regarding my vegetarian restrictions which reminded me of an amazing experience I had here at Moxies a year or two back. My boyfriend and I ordered nachos with beef on the side since I am a vegetarian. When our food was ready our server AND the manager appeared holding 2 large dishes of nachos. One with meat and the other without. The manager explained that the kitchen messed up the order and she did not want to bring the dish with the meat on it to a vegetarian. Instead they had made another dish for me and asked if we wanted to keep the other one with the meat for free, only if I was okay with it. I found it amazing how they went above and beyond to make my experience a pleasant one, and made sure I was okay. I honestly will never forget this amazing service, and how they made me feel like a valued customer and not a nuisance. Thank you guys very much!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the atmosphere at Moxie's.  The waiter (Jay) was very friendly and made the overall experience enjoyable.  We had a prior engagement to attend to, so we were definitely short on time.  However, we didn't have to wait much because the food came out within 5 mins.  
My wife didn't like her meal and asked for it to be changed.  Jay, our waiter, took off her meal and gave her the meal of her choice without any questions.  Even the manager came in to make sure that my wife was okay & assured that her meal would arrive soon.  That scored a lot of points with us.
If you're a fan of desserts, then try the \"White Chocolate Brownie\".  It was just amazing.  I highly recommend it.  
Overall, Moxie's is a great place to dine and the staff treated us very well.  Add them to your list of restaurants to visit in year 2011."}
{"text":"Pretty generic restaurant. Food wasn't bad and cocktails were OK - especially when you \"Moxie-size\" them but nothing to write home about. If I ever come back, it'll be for the atmosphere."}
{"text":"We were supposed to go to another restaurant in the boulevard, but one of my friends didn't like Alice Fazooli's for some reason, so we ended up coming here on a Saturday night. The wait time for patio was only a few minutes. Although it was crowded, the noise level was very low. People were enjoying their beers and engaging in conversations that you could easily hear.The service was good as usual. I got the mushroom and chicken pizza, which is served on the same kind of bread as their Souvlaki. In fact, the chicken Souvlaki and my pizza tasted exactly the same when I added the Tzatziki sauce. The pizza was very so-so, and the toppings were so loose on the bread that I had to eat it like a sandwich. In comparison to the North York branch, the patio is the only bonus.

What I like about Moxie's is that they cater to every taste. There's a food option for those who like Greek, Indian, American and Italian. If you have a crowd that's hard to please, bring them to Moxie's. Nobody has the right to complain here about the lack of food options!"}
{"text":"This review will be very brief.
Food: excellent
Drinks: excellent
Dessert: more than excellent!
Service: Very good
Don't take offence if your date stares at the waitress's bum when they think you're not aware. It's a very natural male reaction to women wearing short skirts, which is how they do it at Moxie's!"}
{"text":"Modern atmosphere. Big menu selection. Great fresh food (with chefs being very accompanying to allergies and preferences). Always great service. Great date night spot."}
{"text":"This is usually the go-to place for the boys. Whenever we need to meet up or go out, this is the place that we visit the most frequent. I have been here many times and usually through out the week. I have been here on weeknights as well as weekends. 

The layout is very nice as there is a lounge/bar area on one side with televisions and on the other side there is the dining area. The set-up of the restaurant is very upscale and looks pretty good. 

The food is very delicious. My favorite is the dessert which I always end up getting: the Banana Xango (spelling?). This is one of the most delicious desserts I have had. It is filling but I end up packing my dinner in order to have this. I have tried many of the dishes on their menu and have never been disappointed. There is something for everyone. The staff is always compliant and willing to accommodate your tastes as they change ingredients to suit your tastes better. Not many upscale restaurants do this. 

There is also an outside sitting area which is pretty busy during the summer. There isn't much of a view but it is comfortable as it has couches and lounge chairs. The service is very good and have never had any issues."}
{"text":"I am never a huge fan of chain restaurants, and avoid them when I can, opting for the smaller, local spots, but I have to say, my last few experiences with Moxies have been impressive.

Situated close to my office, I have visited here a handful of times in the past year for client lunches and work dinners and each time have left satisfied.

Last week me and my guest both ordered pasta dishes, and they were both better than some Italian joints I've been to. Try the mushroom ravioli or the lobster shrimp pasta if you go. Amazing. So good we not only finished the whole dish, but almost licked the bowls clean at the end of the night.

Their drink specials are also a huge selling feature and you can't beat Wednesday evening...  1/2 price wine bottles!!  :o

If you are at Yorkdale, and want a change from Food Court or Joeys, give Moxies a try. They have stepped up their game in the past few years and the quality of food is worth your time and Money, and if anything, just head there on a Wednesday for some after work drinks :)"}
{"text":"How Moxie's has so many restaurants I'll never know. They brand themselves as a family friendly restaurant but we all know they are just a more refined Hooters. 

The combination of horribly overpriced and lackluster food plus not so great service made for a very unmemorable experience. 

On fridays they have some drink specials. The G.T. (their take on gin and tonic) goes for $5.99 and it's pretty decent. The Bad Boy Beers are something I've only seen at Moxies. They are essentially oversized bottles of Corona and Heineken and go for $7.99 on Fridays."}
{"text":"Went here last week with two girlfriends last week and I have to say that I have never been more disappointed in food or service anywhere else as much as this Moxie's in Calgary.   Two of us sat at a booth in the restaurant area, and the third joined us about 10 minutes after we were seated.  Waitress dropped off menus and didn't come back.  Finally had to flag down a manager after almost a half hour to ask him to send someone over to take our order - and of course the waitress came running over once she saw me talking to him.  Definitely didn't get us off to a good start with her, and she wasn't friendly or attentive.  

I got the crabcakes to start - which I usually love at Moxie's, and they were just okay.  A little flavorless and overdone.  Ordered the Chicken Oscar, one friend ordered a salad and the other a spicy Asian soup.  The Chicken Oscar was probably one of the worst meals I have ever attempted to eat.  The chicken was dry, completely charred, the bearnaise was clotted and full of green onions (?) - which was weird, the shrimp were burnt and dry, the crab was obviously tinned and hard and dry, the mashed potatoes were dry and pasty and the veggies were either burnt/limp/doused in grease.  The one friend's salad came with ONE piece of avocado and was mostly just greens, and the other friend's soup was tepid and bland.

Once the meal was finally over (we really just came for the Moxie-sized Bellinis, as it was Wednesday), we mentioned to the waitress when asked, if we enjoyed the meal.  I'm not usually one to complain, and neither are my girlfriends, but we let loose with everything that was wrong with the food.  A little while later, a manager came over and let me know that he took the Oscar off the bill, as I obviously didn't even touch most of it.  In the end, the tab was whittled down quite a bit, and for that I can't complain.  Apparently the kitchen staff had a lot of meals sent back that night.  I don't know if they were new, a bunch of careless teenagers, or if the kitchen always runs at a sub-par level.

I won't ever be going to this location ever again, and probably not to any Moxie's again - it literally left a bad taste in my mouth haha.  Since eating there, I've had numerous people tell me that they have had bad experiences there, and that the food/service is awful."}
{"text":"Nice place to grab some drinks and watch some sports. Met with a friend. And ordered couple of there dish. Ordered calamari for appetizer and as I'm visiting from Canada I can say that there calamari isn't that good at all.  Honestly I did not even finish the appetizer.  My friend ordered a steak and I think she kinda like it however not really sure as she is starving maybe the only reason that she was able to finish the steak. 

The area was lil loud specially when everything is falling the plates, spoon, forks, and I don't even have a clue what else they had dropped. 

Anyways it's just a quick nice stop if you just want to grab some quick drinks after shopping around."}
{"text":"Ugh, another terrible experience at another terrible chain restaurant to add to my Yelp repertoire. Please don't judge me, fellow Yelpers. I sacrifice myself to prevent you from enduring these dining experiences, I swear.

I was going to the symphony at the Toronto Centre for the Arts on a dreary Sunday afternoon. Moxies was relatively nearby, fat raindrops were falling from the sky, and I was hungry and looking for lunch. I resigned myself to eating at Moxies (sigh). 

First of all, the place was nearly deserted, but it took the longest time for a server to show up and offer some drinks. I peered around the restaurant and saw no signs of life. I started getting very angry and began mentally formulating the terrible things I would write about the service at this so-called restaurant. We were in a rush, and I was ready to get up and leave. When he finally arrived at our booth, however, our server Tyler was really sweet and friendly. He called us pretty. I softened. After getting some water, it probably was at least another 30 minutes before we saw sweet, friendly Tyler again. For his part, he was super apologetic and explained that he was the only person working and told us that we didn't have to tip him and that he would put a rush on our orders. True to his word, our food came out fairly quickly. I ordered the Med Bread appetizer and some sort of strawberry spinach salad. The Med Bread came with three mysterious dips, one of which tasted like straight cream cheese with a shriveled clove of roasted garlic on top. Do not want. My salad was pretty sad and wilty, and my friend's salmon wrap came with three slices of eerily jaundiced looking tomatoes.

Overall, hardly one star, MOXIES. I'm only giving two stars because of Tyler, who noticed my friend was sniffling and ran around the entire restaurant trying to find \"soft tissues\" for her nose. He came back with two different varieties because one was softer than the other. Now that's service! I felt bad that he has to work at a place where management obviously doesn't seem to care as much. (And yes, I did tip him.) Maybe things wouldn't be so bad if they would staff accordingly (i.e. have more than one server working during lunch), but this place is on my blacklist from now on."}
{"text":"I had lunch here today and was really impressed with this place.  It's very contemporary but very approachable with a great bar and tables along with a separate dining room. 

Plenty of TV's in the bar area which seems to be a must these days.   Staff was friendly and great.  I ordered the red Thai curry bowl which was very good. See attached picture.....sorry I have a habit of starting the food before I take a pic!

This dish was very good.  I would have liked it to be a tad more spicy.  Depends on how hit you like it.  

I was working that day so no opportunity to try the spirits but bar looked fully stacked!

I will definitely visit again next time I'm over the boarder.  

Cheers!

John"}
{"text":"Another place that is really hit or miss. I've been here several times and its always a crapshoot in terms of whether or not I have a positive experience. Once I had brunch with a party of 10 and everything was fantastic, food was good, service was excellent and everyone was pleased. I've also had truly sub par food here as well where I end up just ordering another drink and calling it a day. Overall I think their brunch is okay for what is available in the area, their salads are standard and I strongly discourage anyone from ordering steak here. Drinks and desserts are good - I've hung out in their patio for drinks a couple times and service is always solid."}
{"text":"This is the type of place that you feel that you need to dress up. All of their servers are certainly model material. I've been to a Moxie's around Canada. The beer I got was their amber, which was pretty good. Then I ordered their classic burger with bacon. I forgot that they only serve ground beef as well done, MEH! I like mine medium! So I was worried that it was going to be dry. It was actually pretty good and juicy. I really just wished that it was medium. Niki was my server and she was very good and attentive."}
{"text":"I've been a big fan of moxies since the start, and specifically this location, I remember being there when they first opens in 2007 maybe or so, and always been a regular customer.
But lately, the quality has been going down constantly..!!
Last time I visited this location was last year sometime in the summer, and I was very disappointed then.
So today, I decided to give it another chance, since I love the 'original Moxie's', but things are still not that good unfortunately.

They have revamped the menu majorly, keeping some of their main/top seller items, while modifying/adding new items..
Presentation has changed also, they now use aluminium trays for nachos for example rather than the original setup, or clay rectangle and oval plates for appetizers.
We ordered three appetizers and all three were too greasy..
As for our mains, we had the lettuce burger, chipotle chicken, caesar salad with chicken, steak salad and pasta. Needless to say, all plates were dry and missing flavour.

On the other hand, moxie's used to have (in my opinion) the best service at a chain restaurant, hands down!
This has hit rock bottom now, the service today was below average, slow and just like the food...tasteless!

Sadly, this puts an end to my Moxie's obsession!"}
{"text":"Not the best service at all!
However, management takes care of any mistakes and flaws very nicely.
I have been here more than few times, some of them were nice and smooth, some others were not that great!
First of all, being at Yorkdale Mall, there is always a bit of a wait time, with a small waiting area that is always full,  you get to walk around or wait on the side and wait for your table. As your buzzer starts buzzing, the host will walk you to your table.

One of the times that I've been here, my family and I literally sat there for about 20-25 minutes with no one showing up to our table, no menus, no water, nothing. After reaching out to the manager, we started getting an A+ service, multiple servers at a time, etc...which is great, but this shouldn't be the case at any restaurant, especially at a successful restaurant like Moxie's.
The manager did everything he can to make our experience a better one, they also offered to take a couple of things off the bill to make up for the delays, and the service was flawless afterwards. but that one experience left a bad taste, and have not gone back since, although I used to be a regular at this location, and many other Moxie's in the past.

I've been having a \"not so pleasant experiences\" with Moxie's lately, which is too bad...this brand started off so well, and I hope they continue that way."}
{"text":"Being a good respectful franchise like Moxie's, you would imagine  better service levels. The food is good as always, but the service at this location does not match the standards of Moxie's or Yorkdale!

I've had a n incident here where we had to wait for half an hour for a table, and only to wait another 45 minutes after being seated for a server to show up with menus or even water.

Management was then called to the table by one of the servers, the wait was unjustified and uncalled for.
We received some good service afterwards, and we were offered an apology and some discounts at the end.
It's a shame that a nice place like this, with some massive competition at the mall, lacks the services levels you would expect.

Service levels need some major improvements!"}
{"text":"My bachelor party crew and I literally stumbled into Moxies after striking out at Escondito (3 hour wait).  There was no wait and we were seated upstairs at a high top table.  I'm not sure how long Moxies has been here, but everything looked brand new and up to date, down to the decor.

Food was excellent. We polished off 2 calamari apps in no time.  I got the street tacos, which were excellent.  Another guy got the honey garlic steak which apparently was as good as advertised.

Quirky thing about their drinks:  they offer to Moxie-size your drink (increase from 1 ounce to 2).  Sounded pretty funny the first couple times the absolutely gorgeous waitress said it.  

Very friendly for tourists as their menu has English and French sections.  Staff were very friendly and looked like they all came from fashion show runway.

I have no idea what the locals think of Moxies, but I loved it."}
{"text":"I usually don't go to franchised restaurants (like Moxie's, Milestones Jack Astor's, etc), but it was getting late and the kids (both under the age of 2) were hungry. They seated us quickly in an enclosed area with bench seats. My 22-month-old didn't want to sit in the highchair and managed quite well sitting beside me for the entire dinner. The restaurant was quite loud, but that's expected on a Friday night.

Food: I ordered from the fixed price menu, Cesar salad with lots of bacon, could use a bit more dressing, mushroom sirloin with a double baked potato (like the one at the Keg), finished off with a half portion of the salted caramel and pecan cheesecake (it was dried out on top, but the bottom made with crushed pecans was delicious!). My hubby ordered the peppercorn steak with an added side of shrimp, both were cooked perfectly. The shrimp was a fair size and my daughter gobbled them up! 

Re. Drinks - must try their pomergranate beet soda (I ordered the pineapple lemon one first, but that tasted like medicine to me).

Our server was super attentive, and was accomodating with my daughter. Our empty/dirty plates were constantly cleared out and our server came by to ask if everything was alright several times.

All in all, I was pleasantly surprised at this Moxie's and will definitely return with my young family! The children's menu was great too, my daughter had the chicken bites (fresh, chicken was soft, batter was not overpowering), that came with unlimited drinks (she had milk) and ice cream (served with dry ice!)"}
{"text":"Typical Moxie's night club atmosphere with dim lighting, coupled with waitresses in revealing outfits which some people might appreciate but I just find it uncomfortable. I always order the Herb Chicken Alfredo but it leaves you with garlic breath. The nachos are good too. It gets busy during dinner time, so it's not exactly my first choice unless I have a dinner group with reservations of course."}
{"text":"Good bar, good patio, typical franchise chain food.  I have no complaints.  Waitresses are good looking too."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is quite lively and for the most part, it is clean. However, there are some things that I see need improving on. I was part of a dinner group and the music was quite loud, there were so many TV's broadcasting sports channels that I felt like I was in a Best Buy. The seats where we sat at were enclosed and they were comfortable for a long duration. When it came to ordering a Sangria, I told a waitress who never came back with one. It wasn't until finally I found a waiter and he managed to get me the Sangria. It was quite delicious if you like red wine with a little bit of this and that. I ordered a medium  rare steak with shrimp and a baked bacon potato. I believe there were also sweet potatoes and a type of green sautéed vegetable. The green vegetable was tasty, the sweet potato was slightly undercooked, and the shrimp was cold, but it tasted quite well. The steak appeared to be more rare than medium but it was definitely edible. One of my co-workers got a lemon quinoa salad and that had a pungent taste of lemon oil which was overpowering. The other table next to us since we were both technically together got the signature white chocolate brownie and it was divine. Ultimately, I wouldn't recommend this place but it does have potential to improve."}
{"text":"Welcome to Moxie's newest location in Calgary. It's warm, it's cozy, it's a little in your face, but most importantly it's all good.

From start to finish the service was excellent. My parents and I were seated immediately, had drinks on the table quite quickly, and though it took longer than it should have to get our meals, the server was on top of our table to explain the delay in the kitchen.

I had a citrus-y, slushy sort of a drink (can't remember what it's called) that was somewhere between a margarita and a bellini.  While it wasn't quite to my taste the drink was well made. I can't knock it because I didn't like it right?

I had a steak, medium-rare. The meat was cooked to perfection and the baked potato was excellent. My only complaint about the meal was the veg. it was a chunk of broccoli. At that it was like $0.10 worth of broccoli (check out my picture). It really cheapened the experience for me.

The bathrooms are nice and I always appreciate when a restaurant has a Dyson airblade installed. I like that I don't have to stand for 5 minutes for my hands to dry while my drink is sitting on the table betting warm. Also, I'm a legend; or so the bathroom mirror tells me. Good to know.

Normally chain-type places like this always end up with a three star review from me, but Moxie's, and this location in particular, just seems to be a slight step above the rest.

Side note: This location is in the Sandman Hotel. Why is there a hotel in Heritage Meadows Shopping Centre? It doesn't make sense to me? I guess Ikea lovers can enjoy sleeping across the street?

{"text":"I'm not a big fan of Moxies.. never really liked it. The only one item I did like they took off the menu (Tuna Tar Tar).. The wings are good, the drinks are okay and the food is okay or either bad."}
{"text":"Is there any non chain, non Franchise establishment with a decent patio up at Richmond Hill??? Think hard!! Are there?? 

Ended up me and My Hot Yoga Date ended up at Moxies... yes it is just so boring... I would like some suggestion where to go and if you think about somewhere decent, please kindly message me!! 

You see all these waitresses with their nice tan, heavy make up, low cut top with their push up bras in their shorts and heels..... I feel like I am at a Hooters or something.....anyway, for my Hot Yoga Date, dressing like that would not automatically get you a big fat tip, we looking for services..... 

Menu is predictable but I do think that's great that Moxie has daily drink specials, Monday is beer for $3.99 for the whole day and for Sunday is Caesar for $4.99. 

Our waitress was just so slow in every possible way: slow to take our food order, slow to get our bills, slow even taking our money...........maybe her heels slowing her down? or her top just too tight? 

My Kiwi Mojito ($5.99) is made of fresh fruits, quite refreshing but I barely tasted the alcohol, the proof is my face did not even turn red after I drank that and I didn't feel anything at all! 

Sweet potatoes fries($7.75) was quite good, but definitely small in portion! We were attacking it and it was gone so fast..... might be because we were fighting for it, that 's make it exceptionally tasty! 

I might come back on Monday for their Beer Specials......I don't think anything should get wrong just ordering a beer? 

Patio is full of smokers, they should start having non smoking section even on the patio!!"}
{"text":"Moxie's Classic Grill at Fairview Mall is a great place to go and have a drink and meet up with friends after shopping! 

4 stars for drink 
- Mango Mojitos ($5.99 +1.50) which I supersize taste great!! One of those girly, fruity drinks that tastes like mixed juice and get you drank before it is too late! P.S. I did not get drunk because I just ordered one. 

3 stars for food 
- Crab and Scallops cakes ($10.99) tasted ok. But I found there are not too many crab meat inside, most of them are fillings 
- The Burger with aged-cheese ($10.99) , (yes I eat burgers too) The beef patty is nicely charcoaled tastes quite moist and has a lot of flavour. Extra charge $2.99 for sweet potato fries. They are just perfectly done, crispy outside soft inside. 
- Side Mushrooms ($5.99) tasted great!! It served on a hot skillets and you can tell they are freshly made with garlic and a squeeze of lemon. 

2.5 stars for service 
- I really don't like waitstaff trying to upsell us with everything! I just want something simple.. and don't ask me if I want a chipotle dip if you going to charge me extra without telling me... 
- Ask for napkins, never get any! 
- my tablemate has a refill of chocolate milk for 6 times for $3 a pop, and while my water was never refilled! 

3 stars for decorations 
- I love the round booth seatings. The way the table set up does give one quite a bite of privacy. At least I don't know who is sitting on the next booth or what they order. 

If you want predictable meals, Moxie won't disappoint you. Good place to drop in for drinks and take advantages of the daily drink specials!"}
{"text":"Dropped by Moxie's just for a quick night cap on a random weekday evening. Service was A-OK. We ordered the drinks and the waitress just served us without incidents. She even checked on us a few times to make sure we don't need anything else.

I did enjoy my Red Wine Sangria, a little week but has tons of fresh fruits, perfect for a hot summer evening.

The lounge area is quite dark, the waitstaff here just kind of blend in with the environment. I think my Yelp friends would not complain about those short tight dress. 

Beer selection just like any other Moxie's have a really boring beer menu, but seems like even guys like the Belini here?"}
{"text":"I'm sure there are a lot of people who love this restaurant, and this is nothing against them. But I can't stand this place.

First off, why are all the wait staff female and scantily-clad? Is that a clause in the hiring process? \"Oh...by the way...this is your uniform. Please lose weight to fit into it because your buttocks may or may not be showing the entire time.\"

Secondly, why should I pay $16 for romaine lettuce with a piece of grilled chicken slapped on top? Not even good quality chicken, probably frozen chicken that came from a horrible farm where they make the chickens do handstands and lay eggs at the same time before their death.

AND. You can't tell me there's a drink special ($3!) and get me all excited, and then serve me a shotglass-sized mixed drink. No. You cannot do that to me. That's sneaky, and you're trying to sucker me into buying lots of these $3 drinks, and I just won't do it.

Nor will I ever go back. There's a reason all Moxie's locations are in a mall. You're essentially paying to eat food court food on a fancier chair."}
{"text":"Came here with Wu qiong when both of us were hungry. The pizza and wings were delicious but honestly I'm not sure whether it's because we were staving or not."}
{"text":"The restaurant is rather nice, spread over two floors. Having not been to any Moxies prior to this, it was a very pleasant dining experience. The hosts and servers do their best to accommodate the customers (when we were seated upstairs, and the noise was rather loud for us, upon request, they promptly seated us in the quieter downstairs section, which I prefer anyway). The staff, while new, are familiar with the menu, and able to recommend appropriate pairings to the items ordered. Their selection of cocktails and wines is also rather large. The only reason they don't receive five stars from me is that the chicken dish I had, while very tender and juicy, had too much salt. Otherwise the seared tuna appetizer, my partners salmon, and the dessert was amazing and plated and presented in a very classy manner."}
{"text":"You know, it's Moxie's. It's been exactly the same thing every single time I've been. I always get some fancy lunch salad with a glass of white wine. Good place to stop in and get a drink while you're shopping. I'd like to see the servers pull their hair back, maybe; it is a little unappetizing to see a whack of super-long extensions dangling over your food."}
{"text":"I came here on a Thursday afternoon for lunch. The place was super busy, but somehow we were lucky to grab a table in the back. The service here was pretty good, and our waitress was very friendly. I ordered the lobster and shrimp linguine and I thought it was pretty good, the shrimps were pretty large. 

It was super loud since it was so busy, so it made it difficult to carry on the conversation - just something to keep in mind."}
{"text":"Food is fine. Service is fine. Nothing special. Decent place to have dinner if you're shopping at the mall."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great and so was the service but we weren't so happy about the food.

Ordered the street tacos which were supposed to have chicken but there was barely any chicken in my tacos at all.  Instead, they were filled to the rim with cabbage etc.

The baked potatoes need to come with sour cream or butter or something because they are so dry."}
{"text":"Stopped in on Monday for a late breakfast. Hostess was fantastic, as was the food. 
There were only 2 tables taken in the restaurant at the time we arrived. Waitress only came by twice, and then gave us the bill. She was nice, but basically the hostess helped us, got us more jam, Ketchup, and asked if there was anything else we needed. We were done eating when our waitress appeared with a coffee pot. I could see if it was busy but I couldn't even see her never mind finding her.
So a big thank you to the hostess and the chef's as our meal was fantastic."}
{"text":"As Moxie's go I feel like this one is one if the better I've ever been to.  Menu hat healthier options( had the Kale and Quinoa salad with poached chicken).  Little pricey for the dish but appreciate Tue effort"}
{"text":"The Moxies at Yorkdale Mall is usually pretty crowded. Be prepared to wait anywhere from 30 minutes to 1 hour to get a table. The big problem with this location is that the waiting area is too small, and there aren't enough seats to accommodate the people that are waiting to get a table. It's particularly bad on Friday and Saturday nights. Most of the time, you'll have to stand there in the middle of the reception area, hoping you're not blocking the entrance to the dinning area. You can choose to roam the mall until you think it's time to get your table, but you run the risk of being called while you are away, and losing your spot.

Why do I keep going back to Moxies? Well here's my list of things to like:
(1) Great location: you can shop, dine, and catch a late night movie all in one place!
(2) Atmosphere. It's a fun restaurant. I usually sit in the lounge area where you catch a sports game while you eat. The booths are private and comfortable. The restaurant is also very nicely decorated; everything is modern and hip. 
(3) Affordable. My usual meal (1 appetizer,  2 entrees, 1 dessert and 2 drinks) is under $80 bucks.
(4) Potstickers. It's probably one of my favorite appetizers ever. I don't know what I'll do if they ever decide to take it off the menu.

Now onto the important stuff: food and service!

Food
I've only tried two of their appetizers: the aforementioned Potstickers, and their skillet mushrooms. I'm a big fan of both. 

The main entrees are usually pretty consistent. To be honest, it depends on what you order. I find that their pasta dishes are always good. I don't recommend ordering their steaks; they usually overcook them. The meat is not the best, either. 

I rarely order dessert, but when I do, I usually get their white chocolate brownie. It's pretty good, but nothing to call home about.

Their drinks are a hit or miss. It depends on the bartender. If you are picky when it comes to your drinks, you're better off ordering wine or beer. I wouldn't order their Margaritas; they are quite terrible.

Service
It really depends on how busy the restaurant is. I've never had to wait too long to get my food at this location. Waiters are friendly and attentive, though dressed in skimpy outfits. Definitely not a good place to take your kids.

I've been a fan of Moxies for a long time, and I've yet to have a bad meal at this location. I know some of the reviews are very negative, but you should give this place a try. If you tend to like chain restaurants like Chili's, The Keg, etc, odds are you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"moxies is alright. our waitress had an attitude problem"}
{"text":"We had our extended family Mother's Day lunch there today. All of the staff were very friendly and attentive. The food was great! There was a minor mixup with my kids' orders so they let the kids eat what they had given while they prepared the correct meals. We even got little Mother's Day flower planter kit and some gift cards for a future visit. We're very happy we chose Moxies for our lunch and will definitely be back to this location!"}
{"text":"I had the best experience. The food was great, the service was awesome and the chef Sean even came to our table to see how the food was. Would recommend!!"}
{"text":"The best servers anyone can ask for Nicky and Emily.  These two definitely know how to smile, greet you and keep following back to make sure your food and drinks are great.  They don't push you to get more things, but when you are ready, they are just as quick to get your order(s) again.  Never wrong, really fast, always pleasant and smiling.  They deserve 5 stars.  The place itself is also great...but the servers can make or break the place, because they are the ones you see most.  So, I have to give credit where credit is due.  Thanks.  Can't wait to go there again.  I will keep going back."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday for dinner with my girlfriend. 
The staff was extremely welcoming and friendly. The service was impeccable and the food delicious!"}
{"text":"Always get great service when I come to this location!
I'm not sure why I don't come here that often maybe I should..
The staff are super friendly and enthusiastic..Especially when it comes to dessert!!
The food is always fast and made just the way we like it!
I love how the seating in the dinning room is 98% booths! Makes it more romantic and cozy!
The bar area is very nice to and huge !!

The menu isn't huge .. which is okay when your in the mood for a specific thing .."}
{"text":"This is a great place. Food is always good, different drink special every day, and friendly and attentive service. I highly recommend this Pickering restaurant."}
{"text":"I was excited to find out that a new Moxie's was being built in this location. It is located outside of Pickering Town Centre, and shares the same parking lot. This location has the same concept as other Moxies' with a lounge and dining area but it also has an outside dining area, which I'm looking forward to use during the summer. 

My family and I went on a Wednesday evening, and we were all surprised that it was packed. Although we made reservations ahead of time for the dining room area, we were seated in the lounge/bar. It was quite busy so we didn't get a chance to meet our server right away so the manager/owner greeted us, which I thought was a nice touch. 

It took over 10mins to get our appetizer, the Bruschetta, which was barely warm, but I still enjoyed it. I ordered the Quesadilla which came with really spicy salsa and a chipotle mayo and a side of spring salad. The Quesadilla wasn't the best that I've had and I really missed the typical sour cream that normally accompanies Quesadillas. 

My family enjoyed their meals, but weren't extremely excited over it. Moxie's does have higher prices but the large portions can fill you up for dinner and still have enough for a take-away for lunch the next day!

Tip: You can receive a free dessert on your birthday!"}
{"text":"Moxies is located right at Scarborough Town Centre, it has a dark ambiance to it with dim lighting. 

They don't take reservations for large groups, its a \"first come, first serve\" basis, other groups have to spilt up into 2. 

Service is good, I've never experienced poor service here but not great either. I don't understand why the girls wear short skirts and low-cut tops (except my brother and cousin seemed to enjoy this -_-) 

The food is good but they have changed their menu recently. The bruschetta and wings are pretty good. My favourite day is wednesdays when they have a special on White Peach Bellinis. 

I normally come here for a quick bite or a drink."}
{"text":"Had a bad experience with cold food / mixed up order a year ago. Decided to give in another try. Much like last time, poor service, poor food! Too many good places along Macleod trail to waste your time here. Will never go back."}
{"text":"I love moxies. I always have great experiences, regardless of the location. This one though, has the nicest night atmosphere. The crowd is mature and classy. 

The servers are attentive, sexy (but still dress conservatively enough), polite and personable. The food is great. They're very good at adhering to dietary restrictions when they can and always make food to order. I never have to wait long for a server. As I said earlier, they are very attentive without being overbearing. 

My favourite food items are calamari, nachos, chicken alfredo, sticky toffee pudding and the whites chocolate brownie. 

I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Okay, by far one of my favourite Moxies location! 

The service here is def. way better than all the other locations I have been to. The restaurant itself is really clean and more modern looking. The waiters here are attentive and friendly. They give you pretty good suggestions as well.

The food.. amazing!! I've been here three times, and all three times did not disappoint. For the main dish, I would suggest the peppercorn New York w/ baked potato and the beef vindaloo. Both dishes are made so well! For dessert, I would recommend the white chocolate brownie, however, the tasting trio is also great.

Def. will be back! :)"}
{"text":"First of all, I think this Moxies def. has the best service out of the other ones I have been too! Upon arrival, you get seated right away, and the waitress kept checking up on us. Not to a point where it got annoying, and there was never a point where we were like \"when is she going to come back.\" Def. 5/5 for the service here, and the atmosphere. 

Even though the food did taste good, the presentation was really sloppy. We got dessert.. and it was basically melted when we received it. I understand she wanted to bring it altogether, however the white chocolate brownie was melted by the time I got it.."}
{"text":"Like this location better than STC and Yorkdale! I have tried a lot of items on the menu over many visits, and I have to say the honey garlic wings (appetizer), and the beef vindaloo (main dish) are amazing!! If your craving dessert, def. go with the white chocolate brownie, it tastes so good, however the full size brownie might be a bit too much. 

The cons to this restaurant would probably be that sometimes the wait to get in is crazy! Even though the staff are really nice here, I feel like the service can improve, meaning checking up on customers more!"}
{"text":"Honestly this location used to be my favourite up until my last few visits. The service sucks now, and the food isn't that great. 

I would recommend their beef vindaloo, honey garlic wings, the chicken tenders (the fries are disgusting though, so maybe substitute it for sweet potato fries), and the white chocolate brownie. We got calamari and it was SUPER salty, made me hate their calamari after. You try to eat it but all you taste is salt. 

Sit on the dining room side if you want proper service. Sit in the bar, forget the service. They seriously need to improve on their service. Especially in the bar, one time I came my waitress was horrible, she kept going to the table with 10 guys and not even coming towards us, made me never want to go back to this location."}
{"text":"Moxie's is one of the better restaurants in restaurant row near Colossus.
The interior has a modern, chic vibe to it and the music level allows you to carry on conversations without yelling.

Service has gotten better (this is the reason for a 4 star rating) and the brunch menu is VERY good...great selection and reasonable prices.

We've been here for brunch, lunch and dinner....all have met our expectations, in flavour, portion size, inventiveness and presentation.

Great place to try"}
{"text":"I love coming here for a late lunch/snack.. a whole sit-down dinner? Nah. Anyways, I ordered the calamari and the deep fried cauliflower appetizers as the snack to share. I love the calamari, but the cauliflower was a bit salty for my taste.  
To drink, I ordered the rosé sangria, SO good. And for dessert, I ordered the dark chocolate cake.. love of my life"}
{"text":"I always go here. The place is pretty good although their prices have gone up significantly since minimum wage went to 14 dollars. Hard to get a beer for less than 10 bucks after tax and tip. Had the Cobb salad which is tasty and healthy. They have beer promotions which is good."}
{"text":"Came here with a bunch of clients/co-workers recently- there were about ten of us and we ate a large table in the lounge/bar area. Very hip and trendy decor. The music was a little loud and distracting-- very bass-y. We weren't sure if that was on purpose or not. There are loads of TVs in there-- you can't miss a swing or a kick, even if you try. 

Good variety of beer selection and the staff was very nice. We ordered two of the sampler appetizer platters which was more than enough food for 10 people- although they did skimp a little on the calamari. Less bread stick things-- more calamari, please. 

I had the sirloin steak salad with goat cheese. It comes with a vinaigrette but I always take mine on the side to avoid soupy salads. Love goat cheese! It also comes with banana bread. Weird, right? And, it's not just a piece of bread-- it's a small loaf! I actually saved it for later because it was just too much after everything we ate. 

Definitely a good lunch place if you're in the Thornhill area with younger-hip clients/coworkers."}
{"text":"Came here over the weekend for a  dinner with friends. I ordered the Sirloin With Compound Prawn + Lobster Butter. I was impressed by the quality of my  steak  I had ordered it Medium and everything on the plate   was delicious . The prawn + lobster butter was the best part of the dish as it added a unique pleasantness to the entire dish.  This steak is definitely among the best steaks I have  had.  My only regret was the way the steak was presented.  I had seen a picture posted by the user Sean N  on yelp     ( 

https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/moxies-grill-and-bar-brampton?select=9NQz2_adUQgs7QhbDBYoxg&reviewid=YPHbl50k-w07Zag8UajMNw) . I  received my steak with some butter under the  chimmichuri. I was hoping for   the butter to be placed on top of the dish like that picture so that I  could take pictures of it for my  foodie memories. I asked for a side of prawn-lobster butter , placed it on top of my steak and savored every bite. 
Overall I highly recommend the dish and I might order it  again if i return  and I will  request for it to be presented like the picture. 


 My service was great . We had ONeil who was  very polite and answered  my questions well.  Gr8  job ONeil ."}
{"text":"Everything was okay, but nothing was fantastic. The vegetarian options were somewhat limited (hard to find any vegetarian protein on the menu) so I settled for an app - the lettuce wraps. They were better than I expected with chow mein noodles, cashews, pickled carrots and some yogurt dressing, but overall I found the noodles a little too saucy and salty. Also had a moscow mule which was decent!"}
{"text":"A nice place to have dinner and chill.  Love their nachos and my all time favorite the white chocolate brownie.

A must have if ur in any moxies.  You can get the bite size or the full size.  Food isn't too bad, atmosphere is nice and the staff is pretty good."}
{"text":"We came for Savour York Region after seeing photos from Jen K! This location was not busy at all for one that's right next to a large movie theater. We were seated immediately.

We ordered the broccoli cheese soup and the caesar salad. Both were good starters. For entree, I had the dill salmon and she had the top sirloin. The dill salmon was tasty, though a little too overcooked for my taste. The top sirloin was too chewy, extremely very difficult to eat. For dessert, we had the mini bite of brownie and the mini sticky toffee pudding. Both were really good and sadly the best part of dinner.

We mentioned the problem with the beef to the waiter and he was more than willing to send it back for another that we were very satisfied with.

Overall 3 stars. Service was excellent but the food is hit or miss."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and I feel like they keep
On changing the menu and the prices seem to get higher.  Our server though was super friendly and attentive but food it's ok nothing too special"}
{"text":"We were seated and greeted right away by the cook.Got are drinks they were good. But felt like we waited too long for a burger and beef dip. Orderd another round of drinks the server forgot. So had to ask again.  Then we got  are sandwich they didn't bring they yam frys  said they were making  fresh . . with only a few other tables in the restaurant shouldn't have happend. Then as we left to use the bathrooms that were no clean paper towels everywhere and smelled so bad. This place has so serious work to do before I decided to ever come back."}
{"text":"Nouveau restaurant du centre ville, un espace ouvert à l'étage, beaucoup de volume, des murs végétales, une déco original avec des tableaux étranges. Un service correcte. Un choix de plat assez complet salades, pâtes, burgers, pizzas... Un choix assez limité de bière. Concernant les plats,  le burger de viande de cotes levés étaient très bon avec ces frites de patate douces ainsi que la surlonge et la salade autres plats étaient aussi bon. Rapport qualité prix correcte."}
{"text":"I wish there was an option for 3.5 but I'd say that this particular moxies is closer to a 4 than a 3 so I'll be generous. 

Of all the chain restaurants in the east beaver Creek area, I'd say I prefer moxies over everything else. Their bar area is really nice and I often prefer to sit in the lounge than in the actual restaurant. The food is good and their drinks menu is extensive. I'm disappointed that they removed the short rib stuffed burger but what can you do. 

Price is on the expensive side for a chain, but I assume they consider themselves a \"higher end\" restaurant and they do pull it off well."}
{"text":"I had the chicken Cesar salad but I had tomato dressing instead and it was DELICIOUS .. I forgot to take pics oops sorry !! But you will not be disappointed:))  
Service is top of the line! I had a very pleasant and gorgeous waitress!!"}
{"text":"Usually when I dine in or near the hotel, the most inexpensive yet filling meal you can get on the menu is a burger with fries. I ordered the 'Mediterranean' with basil pesto, feta + goat cheese. The burger patty is well seasoned + it has the consistency of a nice meat loaf. Not the usual mix of flavors on a burger that I'm accustomed to - very good! I have ordered that same burger another time since!

On one of my next visits I tried on a whim some Asian beef-something with rice. There was so much of this overpowering sauce - was gross! 

The decor/ambiance is very hip. The waitstaff is very young + attractive. Stuff on the menu can be pretty pricey, and from what I can tell the food is pretty hit or miss overall."}
{"text":"Food is just so so
Ambiance is very chic and contemporary. 
People come here more for the crowd than the food."}
{"text":"It's a nice place to chill and have some good food and drinks with friends, or date, and not break the bank.
We ordered the chicken & ribs combo, Street tacos and a Short Rib stuffed burger. Everything was really good and not your usual \"bar and grill\" flavors. The ribs had this slightly sweet bbq sauce with a spice I couldn't quite figure out, but it was excellent. The chicken looked a little weak, just a small chicken breast, but it too was full of flavour and juicy. The tacos were good, although we should have ordered the fish tacos. The best meal was the burger. Don't you love when you stuff meat with more meat! Juicy flavorful and for the price was a bargain. I didn't expect much from this place but I love it when I'm wrong like this.
I ordered a pecan cheesecake, and so should you. Not your ordinary and expected cheesecake. Service started off a little slow but once our waitress came everything turned out great. Thanks Raquel."}
{"text":"A few friends and I decided to go here for some casual dinner and dessert. This was the fist time I had eaten at this Moxies and was shocked by the lack of service we received. When we arrived we were told there would be a 20 min wait for a table but are more than welcome to look in the lounge as it is self seating.. We we lucky to find a spot to accommodate 3. Our server started out friendly but that slowly changed. I decided to go the healthy route and order the citrus arugula salad because I wanted my white chocolate brownie for dessert. I also ordered a glass of house wine with a glass of water with lemon. The rest of the table just ordered water. We were shocked out waitress never came back to refill our water, she also didn't ask me if i would like another glass of wine and barely showed her face. My friend who ordered her pasta was unable to finish it, she asked the server to have it packed up and the waitress brought her the container to do it herself. We were all shocked because most restaurants we go to they pack up the food for us not the other way around. After that we decided on our deserts. Placed the order with the waitress and waited patiently. When the dessert came we enjoyed the wonderful creation by the chef.  My brownie was too much to finish so I to asked for a container and that moment her response was \"AND THE BILL TOO??\" I was shocked!!! it seemed as if she wanted to get rid of us.. it's not like we were there long but it was approaching 9pm so it was probable getting busy. When she returned with the bills, she brought them in the desert menu, all separate bills but in one desert menu, very odd. My friend had to also go pick up something in the mall before it closes so she just stood around with the debit/credit machine after a few moments I told her we are waiting for our friend to return, she responded ok then i'll leave the machine here... As soon as my friend arrived she was right back there for us to pay our bill... seemed very very pushy! I have no complaints with the delicious taste of my meal just that we felt rushed through the whole thing.

Also there was no phone service because this place was underground. Which they should have thought of when they designed this place!

Would I return, Who knows.. not on my list of places to go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner this past week. The server was really nice and friendly. We ordered wings, chicken quesadillas and fish tacos. The wings and quesadillas were good. I wasn't too happy with the fish tacos. The fish was cold and there was no sauce on the tacos so it all tasted really dry. The fries were on point though."}
{"text":"I've always gone here for their nachos.. I know right, their nachos? But it was always the best bang for your buck, because you would get this large platter of nachos and a good platter at that. Warning, they've changed their portion size, and it definitely isn't as large. What I will say though, is our order came to the table (we got the addition of beef), and the nachos were looking a little thin in terms of toppings. But it was no problem, they instantly remade them, and they came back with your moneys worth in toppings. Overall, continued great service.. but slightly disappointed with the portion change."}
{"text":"We did it again...we came back to the lounge upstairs (aka \"M Bar\"). And we did our usual sharing a giganctic plate of nachos...we got eager so we went on an early Sunday evening, while it was still light outside lol.

And with it being a Sunday, and not too late at night, we appeared to literally be the only customers. Thus, though there was music playing we could still hear the staff's supposed-to-be-private conversation (I will not repeat some of the thngs they said, hehe).

However, I am writing this review to say, there is one lovely staff member named Angie. She is friendly, doesn't ignore the customers, and has a sense of humor. I don't know all her shifts, but if you want good service I'd reccomend coming here on a Sunday evening :)"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with a friend on a Wednesday  around 8:30pm, it was unusually packed for a week night. The hostess greeted us then seated us at a table which we didn't like (hate to be that customer but whatever) when we asked for a different table she quickly wiped down a booth and sat us there which was much better. After about 5 minutes of looking over the menu the server stops by to quickly greet us and leaves. 10 minutes later the server comes back to take drink orders, by that time it had been 15 minutes since we were seated and,  we were ready to order. The server recommended the pomegranate beet cucumber soda, so we both ordered that. Then for my main I ordered the Herb Alfredo with chicken. After about 10 minutes our drinks and water come out. The soda was not good. It just tasted like cucumber water with sugar and some club soda and red food dye. Not what I wanna pay $4.50 for (we ordered virgin). After about 15 minutes our mains come out and this is where the real disappointment starts. My herb alfredo was tasteless! The sauce had way too much cream and not enough cheese. At $24 a plate that was a huge let down. The alfredo sauce was watery and could barely get a grip on the penne (which is a weird pasta choice for alfredo, yes it makes a difference) anyways we decided to forgo dessert. Overall the server was friendly and polite it's not his fault he was busy. I'm extremely disappointed in the food and hope this place gets their act together. The ambience was nice and lively  so points for that. If your gonna come here you should probably stick to something simple like a burger, they can't mess that up, right?"}
{"text":"I've been to this Moxie's a few times and have not been disappointed. The food that I have had here has been very good. I like their steaks, and they do fish well too. I like the lemon-pepper haddock and the mustard & dill salmon. The desserts are very good too, particularly the white chocolate brownie.

Also, be sure to try out their beers - the Big Life Amber and Big Life Euro (I prefer the Amber myself). For the more adventurous, try the Mexican Bulldog - A margarita with an upside-down bottle of Corona in it. 

A few people have commented on the skirt length of the wait staff, but I find that that is more the case on the lounge/bar side rather than on the restaurant side. 

The downside I find is that they don't take reservations and they can get busy on the weekends, so expect that you may have to wait for a while to be seated."}
{"text":"I found this Moxies to be more or less the same experience as you get with other Moxie's: which I find to be much better quality and a much better experience than your average chain restaurant. It was perhaps a bit louder than other ones I've been to - likely because of the location. The service was also a little slow. But the food was certainly as good as other Moxie's restaurants."}
{"text":"This Moxie's is pretty awesome. We dropped by on Sunday the 20th of December for a Christmas party and the food was great. Nice atmosphere in the restaurant and the staff were really attentive to our table of eight. My friends ordered the ribs but they ran out which kind of sucks, but I guess they were pretty popular that day. Plus our male waiter was obviously pretty tired from a long day but he paid a lot of attention to our table regardless, especially when our drinks were running low. He probably came by every couple minutes just to fill them up again.

I got the chipotle mango chicken and the chicken was delicious. Really crispy and had an awesome smoky flavor to it. The only thing I wasn't really high on was the lemon quinoa which was neither great or bad, just okay, but that's just my personal taste. I probably wouldn't get the chipotle mango chicken again if I came back but it's still a decent option. The bite of brownie dessert is also pretty good.

The price is about what you'd expect. Can get on the expensive side but it's pretty fancy food. Assuming you load up on drinks, your bill is gonna be higher obviously.

+ Nice atmosphere
+ Great customer service

Can't really think of any cons honestly. I'd come back."}
{"text":"This was a nice to hang out with friends and having a quick bite. The service was slow during lunch but there were a lot of tables. Food came 15 mins into the meal. 

I ordered the lunch combo which was soup or salad or sandwich. I picked the feature soup which was a mix of potatoes bacon but it was definitely sold as a baked potato which shown no resemblance. The fries look really good but all gone before I could try. 

Overall a $15 meal that was way too much. 

Definitely not a top lunch spot in our list."}
{"text":"Don't listen to the negative OLD reviews, try the place out. I was reluctant to give it a shot, but having ate at the hotel restaurant across the street the evening before I wanted something different. 

The atmosphere in the lounge was energetic and lively and could be a little too much for someone looking for a quiet dinner, I would recommend the dinning room portion for a more subtle experience. As I was by myself I opted for the lounge and bellied up to the bar. I ordered a nice Cabernet - Hess from Napa which was reasonably priced ($16 can) for a 9 oz. glass and a water. As expected, the Hess delivered on a delightful full body red that was not too bold (I was ordering Salmon and did not want to overpower my entree).

For my entree I selected their Salmon Avocado Cobb Salad which was out of this world! I declined the peppercorn ranch and just went with the sundried tomato vinaigrette which was very good. The bar tender informed me that the chef would prepare the Salmon medium rare, hello...perfect! Not only was the salmon and full strips of bacon cooked to perfection, but instead of the usual hard boiled egg that accompany a Cobb salad, theirs were soft boiled. This added a whole new dimension and depth to the salmon and bacon.

Absolutely amazing dinner and at a very reasonable price. $36 can before tip and it was worth that if not double.

I will be back when I return to Calgary in July!"}
{"text":"We showed up at 3 and the menu choice may not have been the best, but I wasn't impressed with their food or service. The pictures and descriptions look great, but somehow didn't translate to the palate

Decor is kind of neat and the servers are gorgeous. Sadly the wide selection of food looks great on paper but only a few lived up to standard. The service started well, but we were handed off half way through our stay, there was a lot of time between ordering and our food arriving, and it was obvious several dishes were under the heat lamp for a while.

Started with the lettuce wraps with chicken which had crispy ramen noodles as the main filler. The calamari was decent with a siracha sauce that I requested more of. 

Steak sandwich was over cooked and unimpressive in flavor. The fish tacos had a pathetic amount of fish, and the corn tortillas seem to get cold and stale quickly. ( I had to request new ones when the food came out and still wasn't satisfied). The menu says \"spring mix\" but it was really all iceberg, and the rest of the sides weren't enough to save it. (The guac and salsa were subpar and pre made).

The mushroom pizza was tolerable, the burger was average, the only dish that stood out was the chicken Parmesan and prosciutto sandwich, and I'm pretty sure I've had the same thing in an airport. 

I usually try to be understanding of bad service since there are several factors that can influence that and I'll usually give a place a second chance; but, since the  food didn't save the experience as I relive this meal, it is unlikely we will return."}
{"text":"Fish tacos, and adult beverage choices were above and beyond what I expected in a suburban mall. Beware if you have blood pressure issues or are sensitive to spices. The kitchen has a heavy hand with the spices. Otherwise, I found good food at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"My first experience at a Moxies was in Windsor and after checking out their Yonge street location, it's clear they target the younger foodie crowd. I had their med bread appetizer which seems pretty popular, but I found it to be just ok, not as mind-blowing as it seems most people think it is. Although the garlic dip they offered with it was quite good.

I do suggest that if you're a male and thinking of taking your significant other on a date there, don't. You'll only get yourself into trouble. 

The waitresses dress like they're hostesses at a Vegas strip club, or at least very close to it. I'm not sure if it's possible for a woman to wear tighter, skimpier outfits. Even in the middle of the winter the wait staff are rockin' the shortest tight-black skirts you could imagine. In short, it's all legs and leaves little to the imagination. Taking your lady friend for dinner there will only get you in trouble, so just avoid it. I suggest heading there with the fellas when you want to grab a pint at the bar. You can thank me later."}
{"text":"On Thanksgiving weekend, I went to grab drinks and dessert with my friends at Moxie. This was only my second time to Moxie's at Fairview Mall, and I noticed that the lighting here is a lot brighter than the other locations. 

I got my fruity peach bellini, but didn't moxie-size it this time. It was delicious!

One of my friends has never tried the white chocolate brownie (which I adore), so she ordered it. Lucky for me, I got to mooch off quite a few bites. My friend commented that brownie was not warm enough, but it was still delicious to me! 

My boyfriend wanted the chocolate espresso mousse, but they no longer offer it in the large portion. Instead, I encouraged him to try the warm callebaut chocolate cake, which was new on the menu. The cake resembled a molten chocolate lava cake, which I love. However, I wasn't a fan of the granola almond bark because it was too sweet. But overall, this is a good dessert for chocolate lovers, although my boyfriend still prefers the chocolate espresso mousse. At least they still offer it in the miniature version. 

We finished everything like pigs!"}
{"text":"Went to the main restaurant today. 

Ordered the Lobster and Brie Sandwich (Multigrain) and a mixed salad - comes with feta cheese and cranberries.

The sandwich not only had brie in it but also cheddar.  The bread was a little greasy when I picked it up to eat.  

Overall:  3/5 stars"}
{"text":"Whenever choosing a restaurant to go out with a group of people, for some reason, every group picks Moxie's. I love coming to Moxie's for their peach Bellini. They are delicious. Last time I was here, I had the guacamole and chips and the sweet potatoes fries. They also customize and recommend food items for vegans.  My only issue with Moxie's is when sitting in the lounge they blast the music so loud it's sometimes hard to hear what other people are saying. However, I would still come here and always enjoy having a meal and of courses Peach Bellini at this location."}
{"text":"This place isn't too bad for lunch, I have been to a Moxie's before and both times, the food has been decent and service OK.  We had a quick lunch before heading off shopping, the food took a bit before arriving though.  I got a portobello sandwich with yam frites and my friend got the shrimp pasta.

Overall, the food was good, but still average for the price.  I would come back, but this isn't my favourite place to dine."}
{"text":"I'm glad this place has closed because they seriously had no idea what they were doing here. I've never had good service here but this last time we were there was just terrible. I placed my order and simply asked them to not put sauce on it as I am allergic to it (they do this for me at Moxie's all the time- it's my go to dish) and they told me it's IMPOSSIBLE and that there's no way I've ordered this before and since I have allergies it's against their policy so I'll have to order something else. Right.. 

Annoyed at this point...but I ordered something else. We ordered an appetizer as well and specifically said hey, I'm allergic to sesame so please hold the sesame on top. ...appy comes out completely smothered in sesame. 

Then when they brought out our main dishes the waitress loses grip of the plate and spills ketchup all over my boyfriend's pants. 

The funny thing is that they weren't even apologetic about anything. 

Terrible. I actually was happy when I drove past and saw that it was closed."}
{"text":"Not a bad meal. Price was appropriate for quality of meal received.

Service was OK. Waitress wasn't very knowledgeable about their menu. Otherwise service was good.

I had the blackened chicken burger which was quite good. Serving size was good. Not too much and not to little. Burger came with a side of fries and ketchup (it was nice to not have to ask for it for once!)"}
{"text":"If you want one of the best meals of your life, go to this restaurant. It's worth it, even if you're sick the whole rest of the day. 
The waitress was very nice. The restaurant is huge but I think they only seat people on the third floor. There's also a patio if it's not raining/ has been raining at some point in the day that you can sit on. The food*:
The nachos with chicken are amazing. They come with three dips- guacamole(extra), salsa, and sour cream. 
There are 8 potstickers. They come in a potsticker sauce with some kind of rice-like stuff. Make sure you get a lot of that.
The bread is very long, so you will have to separate it into sections. There is some sort of veggie cream cheese, which is way more delicious than it sounds. There is salsa and some kind of yogurt chive dip. 
The sushi is definitely better than regular sushi. It's in a cone, and you can put sauce in the cone. The cone's not closed, so watch out for stuff falling out the bottom! 
This was indeed one of the best meals I've ever had. Be prepared to have a small breakfast the next day (I recommend going to this restaurant for dinner).

*all the food we ordered was appetizers."}
{"text":"Dear Moxies on Barlow!

My wife and I just dined at your Moxies for the very first time. 

We wanted to let you know how very \"happy\" we were with Corey G's service. If there was such thing as perfect service - well... we just found that.

It was exceptional. You don't often find standout service like that these days and we hope you can let him know how much we appreciated the dining experience he provided and maybe give him a high five for us!

Ps. The food was  delicious :)

We will be back!

Thank you!
Shane & Janine"}
{"text":"Met a friend for dinner here on Thursday and overall it was an okay experience. My beef dip sandwich was pretty good and came with a lot of fries (that I couldn't finish), but there were hardly any mushrooms in it and I couldn't really taste the horseradish aioli. Including tax and tip, my meal came to almost $20...a little too much for a sandwich and fries, IMO. 

Service was...well, not really there? Our server checked in on us once while we were eating -- which is fine because I don't like it when they constantly hover and I have to smile and nod with food in my mouth -- but she never came by to refill our water. Maybe because we were sitting in the back? I don't know. Thankfully, we had two extra glasses already at our table (because two of our friends who were supposed to come couldn't make it at the last second) to keep us hydrated...but still. Other than that, she was very friendly and nice. Atmosphere is cool and modern, dark but not too dark, and our booth had hooks for coats as well as a little TV on the wall that was playing the Jays game. I've never been the biggest fan of restaurant chains and prices are pretty high here, so I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"The worst service.  Waited for a seat for 3.  They told me 25 mins (no problem). They called my name 25 mins.  Just as I was going to get seated they told me they made a mistake. \"It will be another 15 mins\". Waste of time for sub quality food and poor service.  Won't go to Moxie's again this is not the first time this has happened to me at a Moxie's.  Clearly service is not a first priority in a highly competitive market"}
{"text":"If you're going simply for the food, you will be fine. Food is usually decent and has nice plate presentation.

If you're going for a date, steer clear. 

The lighting is terrible and with bright lights hanging over the middle of each table, your date (and yourself) will have strange shadows cast across their face. You will look older and slightly haggard. 

The place is often very loud too and every time I've gone there (3x), I've asked to move tables.

Lastly, 2/3 time I was there, I was freezing cold and had to wear my jacket the whole time."}
{"text":"Poor customer service. Over priced meals. Spend your time and money somewhere else."}
{"text":"The people who work at moxies are incredibly rude and I would recommend going to a different one. The ladies working are rude, impatient, have a lot of attitude and are racist"}
{"text":"Nach vielen Steaks hatte ich einmal Lust auf Abwechslung. Das red thai curry hier war sehr scharf, aber schlichtweg köstlich! 

Die Bedienung war ausgesprochen aufmerksam und sehr freundlich."}
{"text":"The meal was very good.  My young daughter enjoyed her Salmon (Kids Menu).  I had the Loaded burger and my wife enjoyed her Linguine Fresca.  The Warm Gingerbread Cake was great, a wonderful suggestion by our server."}
{"text":"My family and I were spending the day shopping at Yorkdale and decided to visit Moxies as we have on many occasions in different areas of Canada.  The mall was fairly busy for a Saturday afternoon but not overly so.  On the way down the escalator with my wife and daughter we observed a few empty tables so we were completely unprepared to be told there would be a 20 minute wait to be seated.  I overheard a hostess tell other potential patrons that the lounge was available and self seating.  We saw the opportunity and went in to find it 1/3 full with many available tables.  We sat at a bench seating area near the door.   So it was important that I get my hungry family fed so we could get back to our busy day.  We were immediately greeted by a server who quickly informed us that we had to leave as the lounge is adult only.  More shocked than anything I believe I asked for clarification and then asked to see the manager.  The manager on duty eventually came over.  I was on the way to the hostess stand to find him after waiting some time and asked for clarification of the policy.  I inquired as to whether it was a law or policy.  He said it is a company policy and again asked us to leave.  My wife was incredulous and said if it wasn't a law then surely you \"can't kick us out\".  His response was most certainly he could.  I then rather than continuing to argue asked for the head office information and we left to find another restaurant."}
{"text":"My first experience at Moxies was excellent. Our server Jamal was so nice and helpful. The service was very fast but we didn't feel rushed at all...and the food was just amazing. Perfectly done all of it. After a disappointing experience at the Keg a few weeks ago, Moxies truly delivered. Highly recommended.

Shamless plug...search \"beingbroomo\" on YouTube, Facebook and Instagram."}
{"text":"Solid veggie burger with pesto with sweet potato fries are the go to meal at this place. Great for groups of 4-6, with a large menu with selections for ever taste.

Good downtown location, with access to the  tram (tram is free in the center core)."}
{"text":"For a franchise it's not bad. Although their portions need to justify their prices. The portebllo burger was way too small to justify the restuarant charging $15.50 for it. The alfredo was so bland and needed to be modified for it to taste somewhat decent. The cauliflower korean bites had a nice flavour to them and their chiptole mayo dipping sauce was very good. 
Nice ambience but they need to work on the quality of the food itself if they want to charge a premium for the food."}
{"text":"Not a fan of the new overhauled menu, thus the loss of a star, sorry.

I was shocked when I came in an noticed several, (at least 10) of their regular menu items were removed, ie the kitsalano sandwich,  sesame ginger noodle bowl which was one of my favourites, was no where to be seen, in fact there are no soft noodle dishes on the menu.  Also, my favourite app, the bruschetta with warm loaf is gone :( its been replaced with an inferior bruschetta on crisps...boooooo

With that we tried the new head chef, Alex Chen's, signature, rigatoni.  It was good, it was pasta, it was just meh, nothing I would make a trip out for... and I found it really salty.  My husband had the thai coconut barramundi.  I personally found it underwhelming, it tasted really light but I did not like the relish, found it really didn't help the delicate fish.  The shrimps in that dish also tasted steamed, no WOW, no seasoning, nothing to help the shrimp.

Even their seasonal menu didn't bring back one of my favourites, the marsala chicken with seasonal root veg. I was at least hoping to have that, but nope...I noticed A LOT of items which incorporated ham, or bacon on the new holiday menu, I don't eat pork so I can't say I would be excited to try them. Two tarts, a couple of regular menu items, the rigatoni I mentioned earlier and no chicken on the features, what is going on?!  Isn't a holiday or feature menu supposed to have new and exciting items that would make you want to try them?  And why would you have two regular menu items on the feature menu? It doesn't make sense to me!

That said, the pecan macadamia nut tart sounds good, keep up that caliber of innovation and you might win me back.

Kudos for trying something new, now please with sugar on top, lets go back to how things once were...Good effort Alex Chen but sorry, this new menu doesn't quite make the cut for me...will probably stick to your lunch steak sandwich (and nut tart) if I did end up going again."}
{"text":"Celebrated my 25th birthday during the holidays and left unsatisfied in the lack of birthday service. You'll understand why when you get to the end of my review.

We had a large party of about 15 people for dinner. Service was average but the food was good according to most of my friends. I enjoyed my Caesar salad, and lobster and shrimp linguini. The wait staff knew it was my birthday because it was mentioned when I made reservations and it was obvious during our stay. My boyfriend had to ask if they had any birthday treat to hint that I should get one. Afterwards, the server came back and just plopped down my birthday brownie by just saying, \"this is yours.\" There was no candle or birthday greeting. One of my friends had to awkwardly begin by singing happy birthday. Furthermore, the birthday treat was added to our bill.

I wouldn't recommend celebrating your birthday here if you're looking to feel a bit special. You'll get the opposite."}
{"text":"Moxie's is now located on the newly renovated north side of Square One. The three of us decided to try out their new location to see if service and food has improved. We arrived around 6:45 pm on a busy Friday night and were put on their wait list. It took about half an hour until we were called. Currently they are not taking any reservations because of the large influx of customers coming in.

The new Moxie's location has definitely improved from their old location. The restaurant has a modern and comfortable ambiance to it. The wine and floral displays really added an elegant touch to the restaurant. The waiting area is a bit small but you can always wait in the mall and they would just text you when your table was ready.

My sister and I both ordered the jumbo shrimp and lobster linguini. My boyfriend got a burger with an upgrade to the poutine and their special beer special. Our server gave us excellent service throughout our stay. He made sure that my sister's picky food requests were satisfied and made conversation with us as well. Our seafood linguini and burger came out pretty fast and tasted delicious!

I would definitely recommend you to try out their new location because the old reviews don't mean anything anymore. I want to hold my birthday dinner here but I doubt they will begin taking reservations for the holiday season."}
{"text":"Don't go here just for the food. I got the Steak Vindaloo and the Sushi Cones. I would not recommend the Sushi Cones - the flavor is off, ingredients aren't great (rice was a bit hard). Same goes for Steak Vindaloo, the spiciness was greeted w a weird sweetness which threw me off immediately but I had to eat it anyways because I was so hungry. The rice was strangely hard as well. Service was slow and inconsistent. However, come here if you want some drinks. I got the Moscow Mule which was pretty okay! Basically, if you come here, you're paying for the atmosphere."}
{"text":"The service is pretty fast unless you're there on a weekend. The food is great and the prices for drinks are fair. I've never had to wait more than 5 minutes for a table and all the regular waiters/waitresses are really nice as well. I've been to this location many times and only once was my food cold, but even then it wasn't that bad and they got everyone else's order perfect anyway. This location is way better than the one at STC where you see your server once every hour."}
{"text":"serviceable food

average menu

story of my life
i was hungry and here was this place i had passed by many times

lookwise makes me think of a fancy hotel restaurant 
two stories
some interesting art on the walls 
some greenery
service friendly but very slow

it was pretty empty for lunch and it took quite a while to get our food

pipes in music was extreme pop and more than i could handle 

so i would not really discourage anyone from going but just not for me"}
{"text":"Food was good. The bar was awesome. The Shitter was off the hook!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"For me personally, this Moxies location tends to be the spot for lunch gatherings with my office mates, or for after-office work events.

At the entrance, I'm greeted by lovely Moxies hosts who escort you to an open table at either the bar or dinning area (depending on your preference).  Today I met up with a group of colleagues to celebrate a buddy's birthday, we were seated in the dinning area beside the windows looking out onto the patio.  Great open space, with modern decor. 

The amount of times I've been to This particular Moxies, I can happily say their food is consistent.  I've tried a wide variety of their appys, and mains. If you're looking for some great bites, the Potstickers will do the trick (disregard my Asian bias ), Lettuce wraps, Dry Ribs, and the Mosaic Dip (highly under rated- must try). 

I've been on a health kick lately, so I ordered the Asian Chop Salad. I love the medley of vegetables in this salad mix- edamame, Asian cabbage, cilantro, sliced carrots, grilled chicken, tossed in a creamy sesame salad dressing and topped with wonton crisps...could this be considered comfort food? 

Customer service...this time around, I believe we had a newer waitress service the table. Nothing horrible to say, just a little slower. 

Overall- great spot, good eats = happy customer"}
{"text":"Honestly , worst food I've ever eaten. 
Nachos were comparable to cardboard with limited toppings. I wouldn't eat them for free. The other food we ordered was equally disappointing. 
Good place for drinks but definitely eat at home."}
{"text":"The decor in this place is kind of sad, I felt like I was in beige-land and OOP THERE'S PLANTS ON THE WALL and oh more beige.

The servers were great, but that's about it.

Vodka-crans for my two buddies initially had no vodka (so it seemed), but they brought back replacements without fuss.  Don't bother with the calamari, there's about 5 on the plate and they are dime-sized.

Everyone in my group was too cheap to get an entrée, so I can't comment on the quality, nor do I deserve to?!

Give this place a pass, there are better places within walking distance with a much better (and more exciting) vibe.

If they can produce a patio in the summer, that might save them a bit...but until them I'm not interested in returning."}
{"text":"I love moxies restaurants. I've never really bad a bad dish or a bad time. This moxies is a newer location. It is a gorgeous space. However the service was not that great. I do understand that it is a new location and some of the servers may not know everything by now, however on wine night it should be in the best interest of server to know the wine list, or at least most of it. Our meal came first. No drinks as yet. I asked for an extra plate, it took about 20 minutes to come. I had to ask the bartender to get me a plate. It took our server about half an hour to bring the drinks, then when the drinks came brought the incorrect drink for my fiancé; she brought two white wines, my fiancé ordered red. Then about 10 mins later, the server came back and told us the red we want only comes in a bottle; it doesn't, she misunderstood...again. By the time the correct drink came, our meal was cold. Beyond having to wait and our meal being cold, it was a tasty dish. Hopefully as the summer approaches, the service gets better"}
{"text":"I have been there three times now because the service was fantastic! The atmosphere is also another thing appreciated. The women there are confident and showy (but hey I am confident in myself so no problem) I actually had a customer together of about 6 people, our food arrived in good time, the server was excellent and refilled our drinks regularly. The cocktails? Now they are the best i've ever tasted in Toronto. I also like what kinds of people go in there, businessmen and women...classy people. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times, most recently right after New Years, and have always had a good experience.  Honestly a little surprised their service gets as much flack as it does.  Went on a Friday night at 8:30 and only waited 10 minutes for a table - not bad considering the mall was just about to close. Our server was very friendly and attentive, even though the restaurant was pretty full.  I got the Corona bottle (on special) and it was massive for the price ($7 IIRC). Shared the calamari app and a salad with the mom, and both were tasty and came out quickly - perhaps because we didn't order mains? My mom loved the sweet chili sauce that came with the calamari, while I preferred the spicy aioli, but we both agreed that the fried candied ginger was on-point."}
{"text":"Surprising bad quality for the restaurant, especially the fact it's in a great mall, Yorkdale. We sat at bar & left the first table as dirty & surrounding area dusty.  Next table was dirty too but me & my guy ordered a drink. Their house Pinot Grigio is amazing. He ordered the euro beer & when he was almost done he found a white chunk in his draught. We told waitress she apologized & only comp'd that beer. Appetizer was good, we spoke to manager & she gave us free appetizer.  At the end my guy went to men's room & Moxies female hostess went in to men's washroom to take out garbage while he was doing his business in urinal. He went immediately went in stall. Very inappropriate and definitely will never do Yorkdale Moxies."}
{"text":"We went there for lunch and found that the beef vindaloo and ranch chicken burger way too salty. Pricey and to upgrade to sweet potato fries charge of $3.00 and not worth it. Will not be going again, given Moxies way too many tries and always a disappointment.   On a positive note my boyfriend loved their Euro beer."}
{"text":"Dined in, ordered a lobster and shrimp pasta and I must say that it was quite delicious. However, I did also order a chicken and mushroom pasta to go for the boyfriend. Quite disappointing! The pasta was under cooked, and the portion size was practically made for a child. Moxie's needs to work on their consistency a little bit more. You can't just give people a smaller portion just because it's take out."}
{"text":"This place is not too bad for a chain. I won't dream about Moxie's, no way, but as a drop-in - this location is good.

Totally liked the servers - very polite, friendly, and totally helpful when we've asked them some questions about Calgary and surroundings. Thanks guys!

Food was a typical chain stuff, well balanced between price, quality and other economic factors. It is not supposed to impress or pleasure your gourmet qualities. Just a reasonably good stuff - though I have a strong feeling that this will not be consistent across the locations, or even different staffing of the same location.

Prices were ok, portion sizes were reasonable, service was great - what else to ask from Moxie's?"}
{"text":"When my friend and I arrived we were greeted warmly by the hostess and seated right away. And then we waited 10 minutes to be served...

Our waiter said they had a mix up of which tables everyone was serving and apologized for the wait. I got the haddock with edamame, kale, and lemon quinoa. It was quite tasty! Everything work really well together.

Service was very sparse. This is where they lost a star. I still enjoyed my visit."}
{"text":"I came here for wing night where their wings are half off ($6.88/lb) on Mondays but in the lounge only. I got medium and the wings don't come with ranch or veggies because of the special but each are an extra dollar if you wanted. The bartender was very nice and was attentive. Wings came out in no time at all, maybe 10 minutes and were piping hot. They weren't too breaded but were pretty saucy and crispy. The wings weren't the biggest I've had but they were good for the price."}
{"text":"My friend had her birthday dinner on a Saturday night with a big group. Our waitresses were attentive enough and quite friendly.

As soon as my friends and I sat down, we were asked for our drink orders.

I tried a bit of the double cheese nachos which were tasty. My friend ordered a tomato and mushroom dip, I believe. I'm not too sure what it was but it was very good.

What's always good is the white chocolate brownie. So damn good. 

I will probably visit here again in the future, but won't go out of my way to do so."}
{"text":"We went to this Moxie's location after having a difficult time finding a breakfast place in the area.  

Moxie's has a very limited brunch menu, however they are actually open in the morning  - unlike some brunch places that don't open until 11 or noon.   

The service was OK considering it wasn't busy, but our food was tasty.  I got the eggs benedict and it was flavourful."}
{"text":"I went there for their so called \"happy hour\". Really not impressed. It's your typical style of American chains. 

You actually have to ask about their happy hour promo which they are not very transparent about. Tip: check their website before hand.

I had a cider and fish taco and can say the taco was probably one of the worst ones I have ever had. I would give the place a one star but since they had a beautiful mural of plants ( on the third floor) which is actually quite lovely I am adding the star.

Ps: i didn't mind going up three flights of stairs but if you're not in great shape stay on the main level."}
{"text":"Well, to put it simply, I ordered a salad to go and didn't get any dressing. 

But in order for this to count as a review, I have to type more. So I'll also comment on my previous visit. I ordered a quesadilla and it was as soggy as could be. I couldn't eat it, it grossed me out. 

So my final suggestion is to not get take-out from here. Maybe it's good if you order in but take-out is not the way to go."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I frequent moxies for lunch and would have to say it's fairly consistent. The last time I went; the service took so long! Our server did not pay attention to detail. It was requested for no bacon on the salad for my coworker; she asked if it was for personal reasons or for an allergy? After stating that it was a personal choice, she still brought the food covered in bacon. Menu items such as the baked potato and the white chocolate brownie took her approx 10 minutes each time (no joke) to return to the table to say they don't have anymore at the moment. The plus side to all of this was; the owner knew I was there for my birthday and was looking forward to the white chocolate brownie & gave me a $15 gift card to come back for the brownie. In terms of their food, I've never had any complaints with how it tasted. Their mushroom ravioli is to die for!"}
{"text":"This place may get one more chance in the future but for now this place will not be something memorable in my books. 

I came here with my friends to grab a meal before catching a movie. For the record, although this is a steakhouse, I did not eat the steak which might have been my mistake of the night.

The decor was nice. Cozy ambiance from brightly lit wooden tables with dark and metallic shades scattered throughout to give a colder, mysterious, almost quieter vibe.

Upon seeing the menu, I noticed that all the prices are $1-3 more than what I'd normally expect from the same dish at a comparable restaurant. Perfectly fine as long as it can live up to the price in taste.

We ask for glasses of water and I got a 24oz beer. Despite the bar being within view of my table, it took about 10-15 mins for my beer and our water to arrive. Not off to a great start.

I get the Rustic Italian Pizza while my friends had pasta. The pizza itself is quite small compared to what you'd usually get if you ordered pizza at a similar restaurant. Visually it looks appetizing with the crispy prosciutto and shaved cheese on top. Taste-wise, I would have been better off scooping spoons of salt down my mouth. I was chugging down that beer faster than they do in the movie Beerfest!

The dough of the pizza itself is more of a flatbread which is fired to just about warm. There is no charring and the crust is more soft and white than it is crispy or golden and by itself is very bland. The short rib is great but ever so slightly over salted. The prosciutto coalesced under the heat into crispy salt pockets which serve to numb my tastebuds from the flavourings offered by the other ingredients. Overall the pizza had no balance and was awful at the price of $16.75. Something picked up on the frozen aisle would have tasted better.

The beer was decent.

The pasta that my friends had was alright. Not bad but nothing special either. They also got some chocolate cake for dessert which was rich and decadent but a little too sweet for my taste and definitely not worth the 8 bucks they paid for it. 

Overall, the food is overpriced for what we got and how it tasted. 30 bucks was not worth it for a tiny, overly salty pizza and a beer. Would probably not come back but open to go again to try the steak since it is the specialty here."}
{"text":"I agree with the previous review... for the summertime, this is the best patio in all of East Beaver Creak.  
 Came here with a group of 8 and sat on the patio all night long.  The food was absolutely fantastic... had a great steak with garlic mash.  
Moxies makes the most delicious Mojito's ... and you can MOXISIZE them.  When it got cool at night, the overhead heaters came on and kept us nice and toasty.  The nice thing about the patio is they have big high tables for large groups, medium size tables, and nice small intimate tables.  The staff were friendly and attentive.  
I also believe that the inside bar/lounge is one of best styled Moxies around.  
I feel that I can't really go wrong with Moxies... always good in my books.  :)"}
{"text":"I have to say I have such a Love / Hate relationship, no matter how badly they treat me I can't help but keep coming back! Anyhow this particular Saturday I came here both for breakfast and dinner! 

Brunch - Served on weekends only
Service - Hostess was super friendly and fun to talk to, our waitress was slow and definitely not the brightest blub. There was only another table of two dining with us on the lounge side however she still managed to never check on us and required 2x reminders to refill our drinks.

Food however was surprisingly good!

Pancetta and Peppered Havarti Benedict w/hollandaise, rösti potatoes + fresh fruit
First off my egg was slightly overcooked however I really enjoyed the pairing of the havarti and pancetta and the hollandaise sauce was surprisingly really good too! What I also liked was the benedict was served on a thin slice of toasted baugette. Plus I did enjoy the tiny diced rosti potatoes mixed with fresh cut red and green onions

Sicilian sausage hash w/poached eggs topped with hollandaise, with rösti potatoes + multi-grain toast
My sister ordered this and I got to steal a few bites, her egg also was slightly overcooked. However we both really enjoyed the Sicilian sausage, overall another pretty great dish

Dinner
Packed as usual on a Saturday night, however our family of 5 was seated in a about 15 minutes despite the quoted 30 minute wait.
Service- Our waiter, a male, was super friendly and amazing service, a drink never went empty plates cleared promptly, and always there to check in on us, I think the male servers here are far better than the female ones!

Appetizer

Avocado Spring Rolls w/ sweet chili sauce - Came out golden brown, love that creamy avocado filling plus it does pack some heat so that sweet chili sauce is a perfect balance.

For mains one of my favs are the fish tacos however today I opted for something from the Spring Seasonal Menu

Smoked meat sandwich on rye with dijon mustard & a crisp kosher pickle + Sweet potato fries
This Sandwich was Hugeeee, they really did stack it high! The meat was soo fresh tasting, perfectly spiced, love marble rye and they served it was a side of hot mustard and a giant pickle. I hope they put it on there regular menu! Love the sweet potato fries also and they served it with a dipping sauce that has sort of a mild curry taste to it but I enjoyed it too!

Other Orders included:

Ginger Teriyaki Rice Bowl w/Szechuan vegetables & chicken
Beautiful presentation, Mom asked for it hot and they definitely delivered!

Shanghai Noodles w/shiitake mushrooms & baby bok choy in a ginger garlic sauce & prawns
Again Beautiful presentation, Dad loved this dish he also asked for it hot was surprised that they actually succeeded!

Roast Beef Dip - house-roasted beef, sauteed mushrooms & swiss cheese on baguette with au jus + fries

Veal meatballs stuffed w/bocconcini over linguine in a tomato sauce with fresh basil

Overall Everyone loved there dishes and every plate was left spotless!

For Desserts we just ordered a Variety and Shared

Warm callebaut chocolate cake - baked with cacao liqueur, served with callebaut granola almond bark & french vanilla ice cream
Found this cake sort of dry, was expecting a fudgier  cake

Mini mousse - callebaut espresso mousse with house baked biscotti
Love the pairing of chocolate and coffee perfect serving if you want a smaller dessert

Sticky toffee pudding - warm, with toasted almonds, buttery caramel sauce & french vanilla ice cream
My brother devoured this in no time before all of us could sample it. He declared it as the best dessert he's ever had so I take it was really good!

Overall this has to be the best experience I've ever had at Moxie's to date! Maybe there improving....I hope it holds true."}
{"text":"I love the night club atmosphere. It is always pretty packed. I love the decor, very sleek and modern. The white chocolate brownie is so delicious. I was a regular, so the menu was constantly being revamped. I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Pleasant atmosphere. Pretty decent food. We got the buffalo wings and Rustic Italian pizzas, both were good and a perfect amount of nibbles to go with our drinks. Friday night beer special beer was enormous. House wine was nice. Liquor drinks were much to be desired. Ordered a whiskey neat with a ginger back. Whiskey was a two ounce pour. (Was a bartender for years and can eyeball a four ounce pour in pretty much any glass). Ginger ale came in a cute little decanter but no glass. Friend ordered a whiskey sour. She mention it was weak as well though the sour was lovely. Tart and not overly sweet. 
Service was decent. Our hotel bar was closed so we came over. Would come again but stick to beer and wine."}
{"text":"I'm a strong believer in second chances and in the case of this particular Moxie's, I think I have been more than generous in offering opportunities for redemption. I am a big fan of Moxie's in general but for some particular reason, whether it be the unfortunate hour I decide to dine there or its prime location but I cannot name an instance when my experience here was near average.  

That being said, I have never had a lunch there in the five years working downtown, attended a lunch there that didn't exceed an hour and a half. Okay, I lie. Once. When i asked to have my lunch packed to go because the wait was so incredibly long, I thought the sun was about to set. 

Aside from the slow delivery of food orders, the service is also lacking. My mind has been conditioned to expect the same cheery / bubbly service from women in tight black mini skirts at this type of establishment whose main demographic are young to middle aged male professionals and somehow, despite its prime location, they fail to meet that aspect. The servers seem preoccupied and more concerned with the game of avoiding eye contact than providing adequate service. 

You may be asking why I keep going back and the answer is simple: convenience. It is the only one of its kind in the outskirts of the downtown core. The food quality is consistent and the menu diverse enough to satisfy most cravings that creep up on me. The prices are reasonable and what can I say, there's no better way to break up a work week than Bellini Wednesdays. At least they got that part right."}
