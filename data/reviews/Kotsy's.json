{"text":"Great music, great atmosphere and theme. Definitely suits the environment. The food was delicious and affordable at the same time.  The lady who served was very friendly and polite, and did a really good job serving us.   Will definitely come back again"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are regulars here and it's our go-to spot for breakfast. I haven't eaten anything else except breakfast so my review is only based on that.   It's consistent so I like that I always know what I'm getting. Staff is friendly except for one lady which is the only reason I'm at a 4 out of 5. If they got rid of her I would change my review.  She argued with our waitress right in front of us being rude to her about how we are her table. This has happened with her twice in front of us on two different dates."}
{"text":"Breakfast was tasty, portion was huge, service was fast but for some reason the restaurant was really hot inside.  I mean really hot, like they had not turned on their a/c.  When we said this to our server she just agreed with us, nothing else was said.   Will definitely go back on a cooler day, in case, it was just a one off type situation."}
{"text":"First time here. I did not notice there was even a breakfast place in the area as I drive by all time. Service was prompt and staff were friendly. Decor was amazing. Lots of old school stuff. Brought back memories. I asked for soft scrambled eggs and it was done just right. Would definately be back to try other breakfast items."}
{"text":"Food: 4/5 Service: 3/5 (One visit was better than the other) Decor: 5/5 (The 50s diner feel is right on)  Location: 2/5 (Not easy locate and turn into, especially with the current construction on Hwy 7) Price: averaging $5-$12 (depending on dish and add ons/substitutions)   Kotsy's is not your typical breakfast restaurant. We're talking a place with a warm, kitschy, 50s diner feel and food that's pretty tasty as well. If you eat here, take some time to check out the awesome retro posters and wall decor too!  I've been here twice and the food has been relatively the same in terms of quantity, quality, and taste. The service is not as constant as the food, so don't expect constant undivided attention from your servers.   First visit, I got a \"Big Breakfast\" (I think that's what it's called??) and it's priced at a reasonable $9.99. Comes standard with 3 eggs, 2 pieces of bacon, sausage, and ham (each!!) as well as Texas toast, homefries, and buttermilk pancakes! Definitely holds true to its name in that it is HUGE, like I would only order this if you're craving a ton of food. In terms of the taste, everything's really nice and just what you would expect: salty and smokey meats, crispy and seasoned potatoes, and big fluffy pancakes. PS: You can get jam and butter with your toast as well!   Second visit, I got an Egg's Benny with smoked salmon and I added on spinach with the server's suggestion. This dish comes with 3 poached eggs, an english muffin sliced in two, 2 slices of smoked salmon (salmon's just ok, could be more smokey), a hefty amount of home fries, and a small amount of fruit.  I would recommend getting this when you want something decadent and rich which is exactly what the hollandaise sauce in this dish is. If i could I would rave about the sauce throughout this entire review I definitely would. Don't get me wrong though, this dish is not overwhelming like the Big Breakfast can be, so don't be afraid of getting it! Also the home fries are so crispy and bite size, it's a perfect companion for the eggs. Last note: I get my eggs \"medium\" so the yoke is still gooey enough to coat your salmon/bacon/ham/spinach.  So to conclude, this place is a great choice for catch-up brunches with friends, a hangover remedy, or even just a standard breakfast place.  Heads up: This review only covers the breakfast dishes of their menu (and it seems to be the main fare here), but I'd be interested in trying out one of their non-breakfast items (i.e. burgers, etc.) soon."}
{"text":"We found this restaurant on Yelp!   It's got a cool diner feel and atmosphere. The food is very well priced and the portions are very generous. The eggs were prepared perfectly and the sides were delicious.   Chocolate chip pancakes were amazing, we could have eaten another order easily!   Service was fast and friendly.   I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"excellent chocolate pancakes, they are a reason to come back   the server was very sweet with her calling everyone \"honey\"   it was a nice retro diner feel, with sparkly booths with lovely cushioning  you would not expect for this plaza to have a place for brekkie, i actually had to find it on yelp. definitely a hidden gem that everyone must try when they are close to the north end of toronto"}
{"text":"Very loud left with pounding headache peewee hockey team sat beside us screaming heads off"}
{"text":"Such a cute place! When you walk in you get a 60s vibe! It's lovely!   There is a lot to choose from on the menu  I ordered the big breakfast and it was filling, came with eggs, bacon, sausages home fries, ham, toast and buttermilk pancakes.  The waitress was very nice and it wasn't crowded at all.  I saw a guy talking on the phone while he was making our pancakes... (phones are very unsanitary)  The toast was a little burnt but the rest of the food was great though."}
{"text":"It doesn't matter where you are - any brunch place (Sunday) is going to be packed. We went into the Vaughan area to pick up a friend and decided to eat there. We didn't necessarily want a Cora's so Kotsys popped up.  It is located in a very unassuming plaza, but all the cars parked were a sign that we would have to line up. Anddddd yup, the line extended all the way out the door. I really like the theme of Kotsys; 1950's Diner feel with the signature black and white checkered motif, and juke boxes and hello Grease!  Coffee is horrible. I would rather go to Tim Hortons, but the food is LARGE! You really get your value here. The menu is your usual brunch items: eggs, pancakes, potatoes, etc...I came here hungry, and left super, super full (didn't even need to eat dinner).  Its definitely a local brunch place, but not worth the drive out if you live far."}
{"text":"Great 50's diner atmosphere and yummy food! Their breakfasts are so affordable and tasty. I come here often and almost each time I decided to try something new I was not disappointed. With the exception of their chicken Slovaki. I ordered that twice and was not impressed. The chicken was overly salty and it was clear that they just took some chicken breast and tossed seasoning salt on it. It was not marinated in traditional Greek spices so it did not taste like slovaki .   I just avoid that dish and order the others. Service is always great and fast. The servers are friendly. It is worth the trip to Kotsys!"}
{"text":"So affordable we can come here biweekly with the kids!  The kids breakfast is a great deal!  My girls love our weekend trips to the diner!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time! I loved it!!!! Service was great, food was great, value is great! We where seated really quickly, served our drinks quickly. We ordered and in no more than 10 mins our food was served. Everything was delicious. I had the big breakfast. So much food!!! Really good experience overall, will definitely be back. Really worth trying it! Cute little diner vibe too."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Wanted to try a new breakfast place, based on Yelp reviews we chose Kotsy's. We were definitely impressed. Incredibly fast service, the waitress was kind and on point. Just as I said to my fianc√© it would be nice to get a refill on coffee, she was there with a pot. Best home fries ever! Will come again.   Thank you to fellow yelpers for reviewing this place!"}
{"text":"Kotsy's is a great little breakfast/diner place in a nondescript strip mall.  They are great at what they do ... breakfast. They don't do \"brunch\" but if you are looking for standard eggs/bacon/pancakes etc, decent coffee, friendly and quick service, this is the place.  Decor is '50s diner with old style booths, posters and checkerboard linoleum tiled floors.  They have early bird as well as daily specials.  Prices are reasonable for what you get."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and I loved it every time. The first time it was hard to find because of all the construction around the area, but the food was great! The service was great as well!"}
{"text":"Another mere average breakfast diner. Carbon copy of Wimpey's decour yet sub par cuisine.   Asked about the eggs Benny sauce which is always crucial to its success. Was told it wasn't made on premises but was good none the less. To my suspicion it was horrible. The taste was awful and had this cheap glaze look to the hollandais sauce.   Ended up getting a bacon cheese tomato omelette instead which was decent.   My gf ate her eggs Benny but later complained to me that her stomach was woozy.   Needless to say not going back. For those seeking a solid breakfast joint in 905 Try Boom it's delish"}
{"text":"Good foods, good prices but meh service. We came on a Sunday morning. Couldn't tell the crowdedness and busy-ness from outside but once we entered we saw a busy full 50s vintage restaurant. I had the salmon egg Benedict. Tasted good, will come back for that. My friend ordered French toast, it's just four slides of toast dipped in egg and fried, I can make that at home. Not recommended.  The service was not amazing... We had to ask twice for toast syrup and we didn't get our hot chocolate until we were half done. Even when we asked for the bill, it took really a while to come to us. When we asked for the machine, guess what another wait..  Overall, it was a good experience except the loudyness and slow service. Will come back in weekdays to check it out."}
{"text":"Loud environment   Small eggs Coffee lousy Dirty booth  One egg under cooked and extremely runny  Won't make me another egg wants me to give it back instead of making me another egg Fork bent  Home fries alright  Buttermilk pancakes premix pancake mix  Syrup is corn syrup not maple syrup Fast service  Food came fast. Too fast, hence the raw egg.   Wimpy's ambiance  Heartburn 10 minutes after.  Wife began to vomit  45 minutes after eating."}
{"text":"Location: 2104 Highway 7 W Price: $$ Service: Super  This is honestly my favourite breakfast diner in my area. The service is great and the servers are super friendly. It is a smaller diner and definitely a gem in the area. The food is good and I LOVE their homefries! The portions are decent and they have an early bird special from 6am-11am ($5.99 if I remember correctly). Their prices are reasonable and I would like to come back for their sandwiches or burgers.   Verdict: Go for brunch"}
{"text":"I'm a bit torn deciding whether to write this review in the first place, but it's only based on a few minutes of customer service.  I was in the area and found this place on the Yelp search for brunch, and it came up with a high aggregate rating. I called ahead to see if they had TV's as I was hoping to catch a live game, and they said they did and would put it on for me. My wife and I arrived and it has a very colourful 50's feel, albeit a bit kitschy and anachronistic. Immediately I saw that there were just 3 smaller TV's mounted to the ceiling each playing CP24, which for their size is all that they're probably good for. The host looked thrown off that I was looking to find the best place to watch the game (even though I mentioned it again when I arrived).  Our server arrived very quickly and already asked if we were ready to order - which we weren't apart from drinks. I mentioned if they could change the channel for my game and she said she'd go ask. My coffee arrived very quickly, and it met the weak and bland variety you fear for when going to a greasy spoon. The server asked if we were ready, but we still needed another minute.  The breakfast menu is pretty straightforward with: pancakes, waffles, french toast, and omelettes being the main options, along with the regular sides. It's pretty straightforward, and 'no substitutions' is repeated a few times on the menu. Don't go expecting benny's, hash dishes, skillets, etc... It was funny that the table had one of those triangular adds made by egg lobby saying to try the corn beef hash, but this place didn't offer it.  I guess the 'no substitutions' is a general theme of this place, considering how thrown off they seemed to be by my request to sit somewhere else, and not being ready to order within two minutes. The next time we saw our waitress was about 10 minutes later and having to ask for her. She told us it would still be a few minutes to be able to change the game as 'she' (the manager presumably) was busy. I suppose they don't trust just anyone with the remote control. I really wanted to watch my game, and since I asked in advance, I didn't feel rude to simply cut my losses and just leave. It was also a bit of a relief, since I wanted a bit more than greasy spoon.  To balance out the review a little, the prices did seem very cheap, and judging by the popularity, I'm guessing it's good for what you pay for. Just be aware that this is a greasy spoon with a fairly basic menu, and is also not the place to offer much personalized service."}
{"text":"Perfect tasteful breakfast with big and small portions to satisfy. Great and comfortable environment. This breakfast location competes with the areas best."}
{"text":"The place looks like an ordinary restaurant from the outside and it didn't seem like it had something to offer. But when my boyfriend and I walked it and ordered breakfast food, it turned out to be a fantastic experience.  It's similar to Cora's but a lot less health conscious. Everything here is breakfast heaven. I really liked their pancakes. It was so delicious and made just right. I am very particular with my name pancakes and it has to always be done right for me to appreciate then. These pancakes were great and not too oily. My plate also came with bacon and eggs which is always a great combination.   The price is fairly decent. You get a good sized portion for what you pay and it really fills you up. They also have specials for early birds so if you come early enough, you get a really cheap breakfast.   Overall, great breakfast diner."}
{"text":"Got sent home from work early one day, which would have been great, except that the traffic along the strip of Hwy. 7 where the restaurant is located was an usually bad f*disaster, even worse than usual.  I didn't feel like waiting till I got home so I decided to shoot in here now.  It wasn't particularly busy, I guess since it was early afternoon and a weekday, so the one wait staff was taking care of the customers who were in at the moment on her own.  I asked to be seated up near the window so maybe that partially accounted for the slower service, but she was attentive enough and happy to accommodate my out-of-the-way location while she covered the entire floor.  I definitely had to order the big breakfast, and you do get a lot for the $10.  The eggs were a bit cold and dry by the time the plate reached me, but let's face it, no one really cares about the eggs yet when there's all that pork (2 pieces each of peameal, sausages, rashers) hogging all the attention.  When I did get to those 3 eggs, the yolks were a good consistency, so that somewhat outweighed the lacklustre whites and temperature.  I was happy to eat the few pieces of fruit (small slice of cantaloupe, small but edible slice of orange) that accompanies the meal, thereby giving a customer the satisfaction of having the illusion that it's not so bad eating all that animal product if you have your healthy food included in the same meal.  The toast comes on a separate plate which I find nice.  And don't forget the pancakes on yet another plate, kept warm, covered and waiting under the sheet (top plate) for you.  Not that I could finish them, but I had to sample the goods and they were satisfactory. To add the coffee and a healthy tip, you'll still spend about $18, but it's a very fair price to pay for all the the food plus wait service and I'd come again another day. Some items I would add to my wish-list to make it 5 stars:  Wi-Fi would be nice, and a couple of slices of tomato would really go a long way toward making it a fully fleshed-out feast."}
{"text":"Excellent food, clean facility, pleasant staff, major props on the air system.... And again delicious chow! Great way to spend Father's Day brunch.  For a twist, we ordered the eggs bene with a side of French toast. Word to the wise or adventurous... Give it a go! Just transfer the goods from the muffin to the toast and enjoyyyyy!  We'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying there is nothing I enjoy better than finding good breakfast spots. Kotsy's is the epitome of old school diner with it's decor and vibe. For the last half a year I have been questing to find great Peameal and egg sandwiches and Kotsy's has definitely hit the top of my charts. Loaded with meat and cheese on an absolutely beautiful Kaiser it melted in my mouth. Bennie's are what they are known for so that in itself may be worth your time. Prices are good, food was excellent. I'll will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have been in my fair share of breakfast restaurants that try to tell me they are serving me a \"big breakfast\" only to come up short when the plates hit the table.  Kotsy's - however - has a big breakfast that should scare you a little bit.  In fact, I thought I was misreading the menu when I first ordered and ended up being shocked by everything I got for only $9.99.  Kotsy's is located in a tired strip center right on Highway 7 near the train yard in Concord.  We walked in and were told we could sit anywhere in the brightly colored rock and roll themed left side of the table.  Service was prompt, friendly, and attentive.  We ordered the big breakfast and started off with three - cause two just ain't enough - eggs cooked to order.  The dinner plate is then finished off with a half plate of breakfast potatoes that were wonderfully crispy.  I usually prefer hash browns, but was satisfied with the breakfast potatoes.    Stacked on top of the potatoes are 2 pieces of bacon, two pieces of ham, and two pieces of sausage (peameal can be subbed for a dollar).  Yes - that's right - you get SIX pieces of assorted pig delicacies included in your breakfast - that's a lot of swine.  Oh .... but you're not done yet because on the second tray the server brought two fluffy hotcakes that were bigger than the plate they were served on and two slices of white, wheat, or rye toast.  Plenty of butter, jelly, and syrup on the side to make everything taste just right.  Kotsy's takes the usual cards and is only open for breakfast and lunch.  Stop by for breakfast if you dare (and are able to relax in a food coma for the rest of the day)."}
{"text":"Typical diner style, reasonably priced and good quality.  Service was fast and they weren't  bothered by my noisy kids."}
{"text":"Food is really good here! Kept me full all day long. The value is really good too. When we walked in it was surprisingly busy but we were seated reasonably quickly considering the crowd. I also had no idea this place even existed, a friend recommended we try it and it was pretty good. I was also pleased that I was allowed to bring in my Starbucks, and they even gave me a mug for it which I was relieved by.   I got one if their simple breakfast options: eggs, potatoes, and breakfast sausages with toast and jam.  The food came quickly but wasn't all brought at the same time which makes me always question the professionalism of the place. It's not fun to sit and wait for your food while everyone else has theirs.  Some things came quickly and others came excessively slowly which was frustrating, and we lost track of our server several times and it was hard to get her attention.  Overall, the place is pretty good and a good value and I do believe I'll be back some time but there are some things that can be improved."}
{"text":"Meh.. Food is literally thrown at you and it's all mediocre. Found a couple hairs on the table and in the food and the place overall is pretty filthy.... But... You get to fill your fat face if your into that sort of thing."}
{"text":"Delicious.  Fast. 50's diner style.  Curtious service.  I wouldn't go here out of my way, but if I'm in the area I'll be back."}
{"text":"'Lost in the 50s'! It's not very noticable but the food is great. We arrived on a Sat morning, ordered the pancakes with fresh fruits& Eggs breakfast&one coffee&one tea, together it's 38 dollars including tax, much cheaper than Cora."}
{"text":"Starting with Amazing breakfast. Didn't have to wait in line to get a table. Ordered the breakfast poutine with coffee. Coffee isn't good or bad. Just regular. Unlimited refills. Breakfast poutine is definitely unique. The gravy was thick and flavourful. The sausage was a great add in. Has a diner atmosphere. Definitely would come back if I'm in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I love Kotsy's - it's our sundae tradition to take our kids for breakfast there. I love the retro decor, and food is really good - my favorite dish are Eggs Benedict. The prices are not expensive at all. Servers are friendly and always fill up your coffee :)"}
{"text":"A solid community diner. A friend sold me on this place with two words - \"big portions\". We had just completed a trail race at the Kortright Conservation Centre and were ready for a big meal.  The diner has a retro vibe all throughout the restaurant, with old street signs and posters hanging on the walls. Waiter service is provided, but it looked like there was a menu up front for ordering takeout as well.  I ended up ordering steak and eggs ($12) from their \"Totally Not-Vegetarian\" menu. This came with a 7oz striploin steak, 3 eggs, home fries, and a couple slices of fruit.  Home fries were very good, nicely seasoned and crisp. Their eggs were a soild over-medium and the steak was cooked to a decent medium-rare.  Service was decent enough.  This is by no means a place you travel to visit, but if you're in the area, its got great breakfast food at reasonable prices. There's always a place for a solid community diner."}
{"text":"Good price, friendliness and good food. I would come back for breakfast again!"}
{"text":"I was a bit skeptical About this place due to reviews on here but they have Amazing food at an amazing price!!! Very good in my opinion."}
{"text":"I give this place 5 stars because it's a great place for a plain old breakfast. It's not a hipster hangout, it's a just a place to get loads of eggs, bacon, home fries all at a decent price with good service and fun d√©cor. The early bird special weekday mornings is 3 eggs, bacon, a ton of home fries, all for $4.99 We went on a Saturday morning, so the same thing was $6.99, still a decent price for the amount of food. The d√©cor is kind of 50' s diner , with old time metal signs on the walls, and vinyl backed booths. If you are looking for a cheap fast friendly breakfast, then this is the place for you. If, on the other hand, you want you want trendy, style over substance, go someplace else."}
{"text":"Interesting decor and very good food. Extensive breakfast and lunch options and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Discovered this place as our usual haunt was packed...so we drove around aimlessly for 30 days and 30 nights until the skies parted and a ray of light shone down on this restaurant.....  Not quite, but the food is heavenly (insert groan here).  We did find this place completely by accident but apparently it's been on others radars for years (as the place is always hopping). Every time we've gone back in the last year, there's either a line up at the door, or the place is full and you have to wait for stragglers to leave.  The decor is very similar to The Galaxy or Wimpy's but it certainly doesn't detract from the food. Great clubhouse sandwiches, tasty eggs Benedict, fantastic breakfast platters (eggs, toast, meat, home fries, fruit), pancakes, french toast, etc, etc. It's breakfast folks...it's difficult to really screw it up. They have dinner specials posted but I've never gone back to try.....don't know why...probably because I think of this place for breakfast only.  I usually order egg whites only. Most places charge a ridiculous fee for this request (one place adds $2.50 for this), but not here. And they're not chintzy with their eggs.  Staff are amazing..friendly, efficient, approachable, and they know why you're there. Of the numerous times I've been here I have NEVER had a bad server, or a surly one.   Sunday mornings they have live entertainment. Who does that anymore?  It's worth taking the drive to Kotsy's."}
{"text":"My friend and I walked into kotsy's on a weekday closer to their closing time and being the only guests there, we got immediate service. Once we got seated, we took in the atmosphere, appreciating the little diner knick knacks, the murals, and the furniture that gave off that whole kitschy vibe.   As for food, it was on point! I got the hot shaka substituted with egg whites with a side of home fries and white toast. My friend got their huge breakfast combos that come with 3 eggs, sausage, bacon, toast, home fries, and chocolate pancakes! The hot shaka omelette was loaded with banana peppers and I added a drizzle of franks red hot sauce, which made for the perfect omelette for all those spicy food lovers! I sampled some of the pancakes and my god, were they good! Light and fluffy pancakes with the choco chips just melting in your mouth, and the options of butter and syrup were provided on the side.   We got all this food for a good value so its definitely worth a visit when you're near the area, although its not the most bus accessible location. Definitely going to return and sample their french toast! Til then!"}
{"text":"Quick breakfast and friendly service. As soon as I walked in, I was addressed and helped in ordering (my first time there ever) and about 5 mins after I sat down to wait, my food was ready to go. The portion is big, for a great price, and tastyyyyyyy. I had 2 dishes - pancakes and a waffle, both were nice and buttery and fluffy. Would go here again."}
{"text":"It is a quirky diner that serves breakfast. I wasn't expecting much when we went in. We ordered burgers with salad. The salad was great and burgers were home made and had a really nice flavor. The waitress was friendly and very patient."}
{"text":"I love this place. Every time I'm in town I have breakfast here. The food is great, staff is awesome, and there's always a ton of people. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Came here for a late breakfast with my sig other. I love the atmosphere, they have those sparkly diner booths that look kinda like the interior of an old Cadillac.   The staff was very friendly and personable. I ordered the Belgian waffle which was initially cheap but once I added on fresh fruit (bananas, bluebs and strawbs) and whipped cream with a side of bacon (god I love bacon) it came to around 13$. My sig other ordered the three egg deal with toast, homefries and 4 slices of bacon. He really liked that it came with 4 slices and said that he enjoyed the homefries. The eggs were well cooked. We split a side of onion rings and those definitely took the cake. They were so good, not too salty and perfectly battered. My companion said that they could have been the best he had ever had. My waffle was good, nothing special, I probably wouldn't order it again.   Overall I was impressed with this place. I would definitely return. The only issue I had was that the food came out separately over around a 10 minute period. First the onion rings, then the complete egg breakfast, followed later by my side of bacon, and finally my waffle arrived. Other than that everything was enjoyable."}
{"text":"This place is just a straight up greasy spoon breakfast joint.   The pancakes were meh. But if you wanna fill up on a bunch of eggs sausage and the like,  then go for it!"}
{"text":"I'll keep this short and sweet.  I found Kotsy's thanks to Yelp.  This place is a great value.  I can't believe I hadn't found it sooner.  I got the Big Breakfast for $9 and was not disappointed.  Within 5 minutes of ordering, the food arrived.  I mistakenly thought I had to choose the sides I wanted.  Instead, I received ham, sausages, *and* bacon with the three (scrambled, for me) eggs, breakfast potatoes, toast, fruit, and two large, fluffy pancakes!  I've been to other places where I've paid far more and received far less.  If you're in the area and in the mood for breakfast, look no further."}
{"text":"Proper breakfast. Proper portion. Proper price. Extremely quick service. Delicious.  Very happy to have gone here. It won't disappoint. I came here for the food, not the eye candy. There is a lot of that but they don't need it because they do a great job with the food. Price between $5-$9 for a heaping plate.  Home fries are fantastic. Sausage is good. Pancakes are very nicely toasted. Coffee stinks, LOL, but a diner's coffee is supposed to stink so I didn't care."}
{"text":"After driving past this place thousands of times, I finally came by to try it out as I wanted to have a quick breakfast before school.   Conveniently right at Highway 7 and Keele, this truck stop diner offers breakfast, sandwiches, burgers and other typical diner items. They also feature specials everyday such as omelette Mondays and club wrap Tuesdays.  I ordered the early bird special for $4.99 which included three eggs, 4 bacon strips or ham or sausages with homefries and toast before 11am. Boy was that filling!   Seems like there are a lot of regulars and students that stop by for a bite. Customers are greeted by first names and vice versa which makes it a very friendly and hospitable environment. It's good food for the value."}
{"text":"No frills diner style breakfast includes a kids menu at $5.99 and the big breakfast (3 eggs, bacon, ham, sausage, home fries, toast and 2 buttermilk pancakes) for $9.99. If you are looking for value and quality this is the place. The d√©cor seems like a converted Wimpy's diner and is not posh but definitely suits the environment. This would be one of those hidden gems worth checking out and deciding for yourself."}
{"text":"Saturday afternoon and we order the Popular burger, a breakfast with 4 Huge strips of bacon, and a smoked salmon eggs Bene!   All the food is absolutely delicious!  This is a great little place with the nostalgic diner touch (colourful booths, colourful chairs and tables, and black and white chessboard floor tiles included).  Btw, the home fries are a winner!"}
{"text":"Pretty standard for a breakfast diner.   The interior is decked out with old and /or fun signs, and the decor is what you expect a 50s diner to look like.   The omelettes are huge and the home fries have a nice taste to them   The owners are always on the floor refilling coffee and talking to customers"}
{"text":"Stopped here on my way out of Toronto while heading towards Canada's Wonderland. Definitely, plenty of food for the price. Friendly wait staff and just a great feeling of a local community diner."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday for the first time for a quick bite to eat after school.  Cute environment, and fast friendly service! It was pretty quiet but I guess that's what you get when you go in on a Tuesday at 2pm.  I ordered the western omelette with no toast (because it's passover) and my boyfriend got some meat filled omelette. We also shared a chocolate milkshake. Overall a great experience and I'd definitely return!   Prices were great too!"}
{"text":"I would not have found this place tucked away in an industrial area of Vaughan if it not had been for my mechanic. I was getting my car fixed and there was literally no food places in the area. He said to go there and generally I trust his recommendation.  I was so glad that I did because it was a great experience. Fast service (too fast because I finished my breakfast and still had tons of time until my car was ready) and the food was great. It came out nice and not and was excellent quality. I'm not a huge fan of the decor but I guess it is supposed to be 50's style. I really like this place and bottom line I will be back, even if I am not getting my car fixed."}
