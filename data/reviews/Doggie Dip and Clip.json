{"text":"I have been a customer of Doggie Dip and Clip for years, my dog is usually groomed to satisfaction. The real problem is Michael. Sometimes he is polite, but sometimes he yells and screams I've even overheard him call his daughter a bitch when he thinks no one can hear. He can get very rude if you disagree with him or try and question the cost of a session. Also the last time I took my dog in the female groomer (I think she is the owner) appeared high and smelled of alcohol. I will never again trust my dogs at this salon, which is unfortunate because for years they did provide great service."}
{"text":"Place is dirty.  Drop of dog.....assuming it is her father full of fur and fur all over the floor.  Stinks when you walk in.  Last I me I brought my dog in I asked as usual to tend to her anal glands.   An extra $ 5.00 ...ok no problem as usual.

Brought her home she had diarrhea for 8 days.   Took her to the vet.  $500.00 later gave me antibiotic and told me to put her on pro biotic.   She lost five pounds.   They only did half of her anal glands and  also got infected..

I live not far from there and spreading the word as her virus did.

{"text":"I'm very disappointed with my dogs grooming that I had done yesterday. I don't know that I'll bother going back again. 
Bit of trim of his face and butt and nothing else for $65 + tax
REALLY.      SUCKS !!!"}
