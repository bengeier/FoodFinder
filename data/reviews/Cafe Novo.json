{"text":"Finally, an alternative to Starbucks in Bloor West Village!!!  (besides Coffee Tree, which we love, but is all the way on the other side of the village).  Nothing but great things to say - the coffee is great, the price is reasonable, the pastries and muffins are amazing, and the service is always delivered with two great smiles!  We go at least 3-4 times a week, and if you can get those delicious walnut rosemary muffins when you go in, you're in for a treat."}
{"text":"Indie Coffee Passport + good weather for walking = great adventures. Cafe Novo is the furthest west for me on this year's passport and I was looking forward to revisiting this charming cafe.  Every time I've been, including this time, the people behind the counter have been welcoming and friendly.  They do chat with each other and with the regulars, as would be expected, but they also made me feel like I could join in if I wanted to. This year one of the Passport choices was Latte au Miel, and since I'm not familiar with honey in my coffee, I thought I'd gave it a try. It was sweeter than what I'm used to, but in a pleasant way; not cloying, and quite comforting on a bright cold January day. Cafe Novo made my long trek along Bloor worth it once again."}
{"text":"Ambiance

While Cafe 260 felt more comfy and enclosed, Cafe Novo has a much more open and hip feel to it! On the edge of High Park, I really like how naturally bright the place is and with a chess board on a few of its tables, it's definitely a good place to hangout with friends and talk. My personal preference when studying is somewhere comfy and quiet so this place didn't score any points for this. Wifi was horrendously slow, and according to a regular there, it's quite the common theme so for anyone who wants to get any work done I'd recommend somewhere else. At the same time, the open vibe to it makes it a great place for a date so you can skip my negative wifi comment ;)

Barista skills: 8 - A good latte and she was cute ;)
Dating Appeal: 8 - More casual then 260
Overall Ambiance: Solid 8

The Good Stuff

Typical vegan pastry offerings, I really enjoyed the walnut/banana bread snack and the latte was delicious. Felt nothing out of the ordinary. They did have their own kitchen and I liked the menu but I was wayyyyy too stuffed from a previous sushi adventure :P

Coffee: 8
Food: 7.5"}
{"text":"Pleasant and unpretentious cafe with friendly service and home baked goodies. Not the warmest interior, but still a nice place to hang out and read a book."}
{"text":"*3.5 stars*
Decided to finally check out High Park (long overdue!) so I met my friend here since I've heard great things about it. 
This place has a great homey and cute feel to it with its light green walls, milk bottle vases & white painted tables and chairs.  There's plenty of seating and in the back a large communal table with a chess set & huge blackboard that covers part of a wall.  Fun! 

I ordered the latte and was disappointed that it was weak and didn't have microfoam.  It's a small thing but I guess it's a standard I have developed from going to all the other indie cafes in Toronto.  

What this place lacks latte-wise for me is made up by its interior."}
{"text":"Nice place but bakery selection is very limited.  Also, they do not have dark roast coffee"}
{"text":"I was looking for a place to work from with a couple cups of coffee and am interested in supporting independent business shops. I heard or read that the owners are from Down Under, and I love Aus/NZ, so that intrigued me too. Friendly, down-to-earth, I heard (read?). But I was disappointed, frankly. Coffee was not hot, service was quite apathetic, and the chairs are all hard and uncomfortable. I love the stuff on the walls, the organic and earthy feel, the windows at the front and the big wooden tables. I really wanted to make this My Place, since I live nearby, but... meh. SO much potential, such a great location and opportunity - I'll come back if I hear that it's more welcoming and comfortable."}
{"text":"Super cute place, kinda doing the shabby-chic-minimalist thing. Good place to read for a bit, or do some work (there's wifi!)- especially near the front window when the sunlight is streaming in. Not the best place for large groups, but they do have a big table in the back, and a couple books and board games. The baristas have always been great and really nice. I'm pretty indecisive and they are always patient with me. Only con, if I'm being picky, is that the coffee could be a little bit stronger."}
{"text":"I stopped in while I waited for a friend to finish work...boy am I glad I did.
What a beautiful little coffee/tea shop! I ordered a London Fog with almond milk and it was delicious. The two ladies behind the counter were very attentive and approachable. 
It's a nice quite study/read area too...I will be back!"}
{"text":"Cafe Novo is quickly becoming my favourite weekend-morning-coffee-joint -- which is saying something as it isn't really all that close to me (4 subway stops away).

Their coffee is great, and fresh.  The Mint Mocha latte is awesome possum, as is their latte au miel (they put the honey in before the espresso so it mixes properly! my fav!)

The baking is all theirs, tasty and different.  Who knew that walnut rosemary muffins would be addictively good? My vegan friends were impressed that there were baked goods for them too (and I, an avowed omnivore, couldn't tell the difference)

And the people watching! they have set up a bar along the front window, so you can watch people walking along High Park.  Its great.

Only two beefs: no patio yet (though I understand that has more to do with city bureaucracy than anything else) and their debit machine is slow-as-molasses (which, again, isn't something the girls can do anything about.)  If those two gripes go away, then that last star gets added in.

Cafe Novo has become one my 'my places' in this city."}
{"text":"This place is NICE 
the ppl were nice, nice location, fair trade coffee, you can keep your mug there - all nice things 

Could be better if it offered more food, maybe a healthy sandwich full of veggies and hummus? 

the high tea plate is a cute idea, but i need more than veggies and a hard boiled egg 

Would definitely go back for an iced latte and a seat on the patio next to the park."}
{"text":"Strolled in on a beautiful Sunday afternoon (April 18, 2010) around 2:30ish after a bike ride around High Park. The place was packed with people everywhere and the Barista's seemed very stressed out especially the girl that was operating the cash register. 
We looked for a spot to sight down and we found a long table in the back of the Cafe (communal style sitting). Black board on the back wall where patron's leave messages - very good idea and very cool.

You feel at home as you look around and it's definitely very laid back. Went back to order our drinks & treats. The girl at the cash register was very stressed out, the big line-up must have done something to her. She was very pleasant in the midst of her rising stress level. I got one of their Organic black tea's and my husband got their organic coffee. Our drinks were so, so we have definitely had better Organic Tea's & Coffee. Our kids had Organic Milk and there were satisfied.

Raisin & Chocolate Chip Cookie - Was very yummy as per my Stepson

Chocolate Espresso Biscotti - Was Tasty

Cake Slice - Yummy

Mini Blueberry Muffin - Yummy as well

Cute Cafe, we will definitely go back again...............Maybe when it's not as busy......."}
{"text":"Found this place on a rainy Sunday after wandering the streets for a while (our usual coffee spots were packed). 

I was looking for a place that could accommodate my study needs for a few hours and Cafe Novo did not disappoint. Concentrating on my work was easy, as the atmosphere here is really relaxed and cozy. There's a variety of seating options, including a communal table in the back and a bar by the window (perfect for people watching!). There are also a few tables downstairs by the washrooms, if you're really desperate for a seat, haha. And for the laptop-toting folks out there - this place boasts a decent selection of power outlets as well as free wifi, although the latter was pretty slow when I was here. Bonus: the drip coffee I ordered - although a teensy bit pricey - was delicious! 

I'll be back."}
{"text":"I had a great iced latte on the large outdoor patio facing High Park. The open-concept cafe is very bright and welcoming, and conveniently  in front of High Park Station. The cafe sells hot or cold coffee-based drinks, tea and lemonade, as well as baked goods, like almond biscotti and carrot cake cupcakes, which are all made in-house. In the afternoons, they serve 'high tea' plates, which include a hard-boiled egg, fruit, vegetables and cheese. The coffee is all fair-trade and all of their baked goods are made with organic ingredients. Regular customers can also opt to leave their own mug behind to reuse each visit. Great addition to the neighbourhood and  a nice alternative to Starbucks down the street."}
{"text":"Cafe Novo is really good at being what it is.

Is it trying to be Manic or Crema? No (and thank freaking god for that). What it is, however, is one of the friendliest cafes I've ever been to, has reliable coffee (though they really should use smaller cups for their americanos), pretty good baked goods, a nice space, but is also conveniently located to jump off the subway and grab a coffee. 

As long as you aren't going in expecting latte art and pretension, you'll be juuuuuust fine."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place another shot as it's uber convenient for me....fail.

Cafe Novo, I can see that you're trying but you really need to pick up your game. I don't even need to comment on the quality of the food or coffee because you have flies...A LOT of flies. I couldn't sit still for more than a minute without being dive bombed by the flock. It's time to invest in some fly paper. It makes is incredibly unpleasant to sit in the cafe and how can anyone help but question the cleanliness?

Sigh"}
{"text":"Pros:
-lots of seating
-friendly staff
-good music that isn't too loud (they were playing Tegan and Sara when I was there-- love!!)
-organic and fair trade focused
-drinks seem fairly standard in price, size, and wait times

Cons:
-not sure if they had wifi for customers to use-- certainly didn't see any obvious signage with a password or anything (maybe have to ask a staff member)
-wobbly table
-food is expensive, and may take a while if heated 

Stopped in on my lunch break since I wanted something caffeinated to go along with lunch, and wasn't looking for a breakfast/brunch joint. They didn't have much in the way of food-- a couple baked goods/cookie options, and the rest was from a cooler which didn't have a lot of options. I opted for a falafel sandwich and a mocha. There wasn't any pricing on the food that I saw, so I was quite surprised when my total was near $15! If I had known the sandwich was going to be about $10, I probably would have gotten something else. (note: the sandwich was fairly large with good ingredients, so I think the price was justified-- it is just not a place for cheap eats!)

I ordered my food to eat in. The mocha was prepared quickly, but they served it in a glass! This seems to be common at Toronto coffee houses, but I will never understand since the heat from the beverage seeps outwards and makes it uncomfortable to hold, without any handle to carry it by instead. The mocha was good, but a little bitter for my tastes. 
The woman working at the time asked if I wanted the sandwich heated up, so I said sure. It took about 10 minutes (maybe more) to get the sandwich after getting my mocha, when I was expecting it to only take a couple minutes to warm up. I was starting to get paranoid that I wouldn't have time to eat before having to go back to work! In the end though, I could only eat about half of the sandwich before it got too falafel-y anyways-- I take full responsibility for that though, since I can't blame the sandwich for delivering what it promised ;).

tldr;
Overall a pretty good coffee house. If in the area, I would come back for the beverages but not the food (though I might try one of the baked goods next time)."}
{"text":"Novo's location and decor are great - right across from High Park, directly outside of High Park station, with plenty of seating inside and a patio that's surprisingly shady and quiet given its proximity to Bloor. I'd come here a lot more, especially in the summer, if the coffee was just a bit less expensive. I paid what I believe was $2.47 for a large iced coffee today, which wasn't all that large (maybe a bit bigger than a small at Tim Hortons or Starbucks; for comparison, a large coffee at Crema is $2.25). True, they make it with a French press, but still - it's more than I can do on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Love the lavender shortbread, the organic and fair-trade options. Great hot bevs and quirky but always friendly staff :)"}
{"text":"I remember when this was a bar named Kiwi Kick a few years ago.  Well the place is under completely new management, and it is near my favourite bar MacKenzies High Park. Since I mostly order double Americanos from this place, all I can say is that they are made right and are hot. I really like the atmosphere, which is also a great place to have an informal meeting and get work done.  It has a large patio, very near the western exit of the High Park subway station. My only knock on it is the lack of food choices, but really, you come here for the coffee.  A really nice addition to High Park."}
{"text":"Slow and unfriendly service.  If the coffee and baked goods were better I'd ignore the poor service as the location is great for me.  Went there four times and only when my boyfriend was with me once did the girl behind the counter perk up and greet him (not us) within 10 seconds."}
{"text":"I enjoyed visiting Café Novo back when it was on the west end so I was excited to see that it hadn't closed permanently and had only moved across the city. I checked out the new location and was... disappointed. The new location has a distinctly un-clean vibe to it. I tried to pour some cream in my coffee but when nothing came out, I opened it to see that it was completely spoiled and nearly turned into a solid. When I opened the milk, there was a dead bug in it. The whole place was full of fruit flies and dust. My 12oz coffee had about half an inch of coffee grounds at the bottom. Get it together, guys! Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Overall I'm not too impressed by this place. The only good thing about it is the location and the fact that there is a nice shady patio (needs some cleanup though). The quality of coffees and snacks is mediocre and overpriced. I was shocked to be charged $4 for a small cup of steamed milk for my child (Starbucks would have charged me $1 !!). On top of all that I find most of the employees there rather disgruntled or daydreaming .... All in all Café Novo is not my first choice in the neighbourhood and I sincerely hope that some day a new owner will clean up the place and turn into a café like some of  the independent places on Roncy  ..."}
{"text":"perhaps this place use to be good, but when i went there coffee is super weak , tasted  mostly of water not coffee ..so it was like brown water, not sure what happen there,also it was pretty much warm it wasn't hot enough,and they don't have any sweetener available. ive spoken to a handful of people that have had issues with this place and some attitude from the folks that work there, but i personally didn't have  a problem with the staff. wont be coming back as i know of another place that serve excellent coffee, the only reason i went that one time is because they were the only thing open nearest to me in the morning."}
{"text":"I'm writing this from Cafe Novo's free wifi, sitting on their bar which looks over High Park. It's quite a lovely view, although this seat isn't very comfortable.

I'm drinking an Americano Misto, which is maybe a little too watery, but tastes good. I wanted to get a cupcake but they were out. They make them in house apparently. 

The space is pretty good, it's open, there's a nice looking piano in the back (which I'm happy no one is playing). 

Staff is pleasant. I'm satisfied.

three pats. for credit cards they require at least spending $5, which is against visa vendor conditions. you lose a pat on the back for that one."}
{"text":"We'll start with cons, representative of the 2-star rating;

CONS:  
-Regular latte is pretty small, 10 oz.
-Regular 10 oz latte comes with 1 shot of espresso.
-Regular 10 oz latte with an extra shot is 4.80.  Seems kinda steep.
-My 4.80 regular 10 oz latte, without foam (by request), came up to about 2 cms below the top of the cup.
-No latte art.  (I don't know why, but it makes a difference to my enjoyment of the experience.)

PROS:
-My regular 10 oz latte, with the extra shot, tasted pretty good.
-They have a cupboard where, as a regular, you can keep your own mug.  Cool idea.
-They stamped my Indie Coffee Passport with enthusiasm"}
{"text":"At first I thought Cafe Novo would be one of those pretentious espresso-only cafes, but it wasn't. They have drip coffee and a nice selection of books to read. A fine place indeed."}
{"text":"This place is a nice neighbourhood spot.  

Upsides: great latte, served in a huge glass (didn't burn my hand), my first time ever having a rosemary walknut muffin, super friendly staff, sitting at the bar, facing High Park and reading a book or doing a crossword puzzle . It seems like the kind of place people from the neighbourhood come to hang out. In fact, around noon on a Saturday it was packed with families and young kids, spread out in the spacious seating area.  A nice big communal table is great for groups. 

Downsides: can i complain it was too sunny when I pulled out my laptop, or is that just being fussy. Other downsides - internet was intermittent, and, as Michelle A. warned, it is pretty away from the sunny window.  

Would come back if I lived in the area!"}
{"text":"The new location for Cafe Novo is an excellent addition to Kensington. The thing that makes them stand out from the other coffee spots in the Market is that everything is organic - from the milk, to the food, and, obviously, the coffee and tea too. The latte I had this afternoon was fantastic. The delicate shot of Rufino espresso was perfectly pulled, unlike a lot of places which burn the coffee in the process. The organic milk gave the drink a very light, smooth texture as well. The staff and owner were all extremely nice, and the music selection today (a mix of classic post-punk) was excellent. They also did a great job renovating the place after the departure of Playdead and Comic Pile, as the cafe is very open and inviting. Unfortunately I didn't get to try out the patio due to today's low temperatures, but I will definitely be back in the near-future."}
{"text":"Quiet coffee shop, great for studying and we'll maintained. Free WiFi & strong coffee. I like supporting fair trade and healthy alternatives but be ready to pay for the privilege. Worth it"}
{"text":"Great place to get work done: Friendly service, cozy, lots of tables, lots of plugs for laptop, good Wi-fi.

Chai latte was great and they use organic milk.  Some healthy sandwiches and lots of cookies. Great music. View of the park.

Decent hours (until 7pm most nights)."}
{"text":"Cafe Nova is the latest addition to the Market's café scene helping the neighbourhood become a mecca for mocha. Facing the eastern sky in the morning the spacious room is brightly lit with its antique white interior, big picture windows and cute little tables and chairs dotting the patio space out front. High stools let you people watch from inside along the front. 
Further back is the counter with its gorgeous latte machine (see pic) and hand lettered menu up on the wall. I love the small town feel to this café. My multi berry muffin was delicious and I can't wait to try a latte here."}
{"text":"A decidedly unique, and yet easily recognizable as a truly Kensingtonian place. Quiet chatter at the counter, long dark wooded communal table propped up at one corner with folded brochure, a couple students labouring at a test with hard looking formulas... The book shelves filled with plethora of topics: from wild mushrooms of North America to Chihuaha for Dummies, but make sure to check out the deliciously quaint Cafe Navo Book of Memories. A cozy tiny patio in the back with living wall and overgrown tussled vegetation providing gentle cover from the hot late August sun. The AC can't quite deal with the hot weather today, maybe it's the whitewashed walls, maybe it's the Argentinian looking gentleman sitting in front me, but I easily imagine myself in the Bicycle Diaries of Che Gueavara.


The coffee is good, but it's just an excuse to hide away from the city and life for a bit and pretend that time stops for someone, sometimes."}
{"text":"The coffee at Cafe Novo is *really* good, and they have both soy and almond milk offerings right on the counter. I had a spicy chocolate cookie, too. Wifi is reliable and no-nonsense (lacks encryption though). My laptop is plugged into a power outlet and the surface area available to me at the big table I'm at is substantial. There are good but slightly smaller tables with another power outlet closeby. This place is great for working, socializing, or relaxing."}
{"text":"Novo's a stone's throw from High Park, which is handy for a number of reasons - nice and easy to get to from the subway, lovely views of the park from the cafe, and convenience of getting your coffee to go and wander through the park.

If you choose to sit in, however, you'll find yourself quite at home. There's a pretty good amount of seating inside and out, and the area at the back with the piano, bookshelf and communal seating area smacks of coziness. They also have some decent tunes wafting in the background - enough to break the silence, but not to overwhelm conversation.

I've tried both a soy latte and an americano, created with care on their gorgeous espresso machine - the coffee is very nice, not too overwhelmingly strong in flavour and no hint of bitterness. Last visit I also tried one of their selection of vegan baked goods (made in-house!) - nothing's really labeled, so just ask what's what (both vegan and not) and they'll show you.

A water cooler (with fresh mint) is just around from the counter if you're parched, and there's also a washroom downstairs. Novo also have free wifi, so you're pretty much set here! It's not in my 'hood, but I think I like it enough there I might make the trip more regularly - and it's a nice excuse to visit the park!"}
{"text":"By far, my favourite study space. The space has chatter but isn't noisy and is usually not so busy that I can't find a seat with a plug.
Coffee and WiFi are both excellent, but coffee is expensive.
Food is just OK, but blackbird baking is right down the street if you need a snack."}
{"text":"I came here as one of my stop for Indie Coffee passport 2012 (ICP). In the previous visits my go to drink cappuccino didn't impress so I wanted to try something new. Among the offerings was Latte au miel (latte sweetend with honey as per their explanation) I haven't had this drink before so decided to give it a try. 
Espresso: Mild
Crema': OK
Milk: OK
Latte Art: average
The base of the drink was coated with honey I guess as I didn't feel it until the last few sips. I didn't think much of this drink. They don't have dearth of customers so I doubt my view will make a difference to them but this place is not my cup of tea (or cappuccino in my case :) 
Location is excellent, so is the setup. I can see some people being ardent fans of this spot but it doesn't appeal to me."}
{"text":"This is definitely a cool spot in a really great location with some delicious coffee, we highly recommend a trip to Cafe Novo."}
{"text":"This coffee shop is right across the street from high park, which is a great location. I was there on Mothers Day. The day was sunny, warm and just beautiful. If there was space on their patio, I would have snapped it up before ordering. The patio is on Bloor street.

The order was a large coffee, a large almond milk latte (that's right - ALMOND milk), and a chocolate cookie. The coffees were great and the cookie was chocolate and moist but not too sweet. In addition to standard coffe shop items, they also had their summer menu up which included lemonades and italian soda. Prices are on par with most coffee chains. Service was quick and straightforward.

There was seating available in the back, but with it being such a nice day, we took a spot at the bar that faces Bloor street. The roll-up garaage-style window was up, so it was almost as good as being on the patio. Normally this door would act as a window.

Great place, exactly what I would look for in a cafe."}
{"text":"Somehow I feel like Cafe Novo really wants to use their sizable patio and the chairs facing outside as a place for people to hang and do some people watching. However it is located in an area where really, not a lot of people walk by and you will be staring at a boring part of Bloor West. You see, this venue is located in the socially anemic hole in between where bars/cafes stop east Keel and resume west of Runnymede. 

However, it does have the advantage of being across High Park and since there next to nothing else around here except for perhaps a Starbucks up the hill to the west, then it has the locals market covered down pat.

It is also very close to the subway station, and the decor has a cottage kitsch which is cute although not cute enough to make the trek if you are not a local. 

Now since I am not the best coffee connoisseur, I enlisted the help of my Indie Coffee Passport comrade and java-loving-friend Karthik, to give me the 411 on the coffee here. Sadly after a few minutes chat, he scored it to merely \"okay\" which I also tend to concur.  Now since he lives about 5 minutes north of Cafe Novo, I asked him where he goes to get his beans rocked and he recommend the superior The Good Neighbour on Annette street. Which we then proceeded to visit right after Cafe Novo and... yes, the coffee WAS better at the Good Neighbour but more details on that can wait until that venue's review.  

Now the good thing about Cafe Novo is you will find have a few plugs if you want to bring your laptop along free wifi. However I would not go out of my way to come here, although I would if I was coming out from a day at High Park out of sheer convenience."}
{"text":"After a long day at High Park (I seriously keep pronouncing it \"Hyde\" Park) Cafe Novo would be a great stop for coffee before jumping on the subway. Or a great perfect spot for a cup to have with you while you walk the park! Unfortunately I came here in the winter and no fun day in the park was had.
 
I usually end up knowing what star rating a place is on my indie coffee adventures when I'm leaving the location, but with Cafe Novo, an experience that was 3 stars eventually became a 4 star one the more I reflected back on it.
 
As I (and everyone else) has already noted, it's a great location, it's got enough room to have a seat, not the most comfortable of seating options though with little wooden chairs, their communal table has the big chalk board as a wall and that was cute and if I was creative enough I'd be all over that!
 
I was a little disappointed by their snack options and my mocha while good, was not my favourite. I enjoy the fact that you can see their mini kitchen just out in the open where they make \"stuff\", and they also had a little photo album that's been converted in to a guest book where people have left in napkins with poems, notes, sketches etc on and that was fun to flip through as we were leaving.
 
The staff were very friendly, there's a really relaxing ambience given off here, highlighted by their bright wall colours and big glassy mugs your drinks come in. Can't wait for visits to the park capped on both ends by a stop here!"}
{"text":"For my mom's first trip to High Park, I looked for a local cafe where we could chill after our walk. Naturally, I searched on Yelp...Cafe Novo seemed perfect...

The free-trade coffee was great and the selection of non-dairy milks and creams impressive. However, the service was less than mediocre. The baristas weren't busy when we came in (there were only 2 other patrons, already seated), but they refrained from any friendly conversation. I wanted something sweet with my coffee and asked about the cake balls, but the baristas didn't promote them; they exuded \"a take it or leave it\" attitude. 

Next time, I'll get a coffee to go, but leave the cake to the baristas."}
{"text":"Cute, convenient and great location. 

I love the decor of the place. Like a modern cottage kitchen. And it's rare to find a coffee shop that's not Starbucks or 2nd Cup with an outdoor patio. 

The have an extensive list of teas and coffees. And all types of milks including soy and almond can be used without extra charge!
I also had a Blueberry Roobios tea and it was yummy. 

The folks were super friendly and chatty. 

Great for a chat with friends or to pick up something before a stroll in the park. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"\"Cafe Novo is not too focused on breakfast food, however there is a large selection of coffee drinks and teas. \"
\"This cafe is about meeting local people and being social. The atmosphere will put you in the right mood. It is a very friendly place with a piano in the corner, stucco walls, weathered wooden tables and a chess board in the middle. \"

This is just a bite of our review.."}
{"text":"From the High Park subway station you walk out along the pathway to see pretty much a Grassy scene directly ahead.  Next thing noticeable is Cafe Novo.  Talk about prime location, I bet Starbucks or McDonald's has their eyes on this if anything would happen to Novo.  

It is literally steps away so you can get your drink then get back on the Subway to Runnymede where civilization begins again although it would mean some stairmaster exercises(Parkview Gardens South exit) which is just as much a pain.

I find Novo to be in 3 separate sections where the back is the Library section with a Piano, Fireplace, huge Blackboard near the communal table while few others decide to couple up at the mid-section with one of those tiny White tables placing their Macbooks together like they're playing Battleship.

The front space is more of the grab-and-go space where even the counter space seemed so small you wonder why they don't extend the Coffee counter towards the back where the Kitchen space is as it goes unused once the Bakery Goods are completed for the day.

The Cappuccino served using the Steelite Ceramic Cup was unexpected but has a larger handle than other Cups for handling ease and comfort, the Beverage was A-OK and quite a good portion for a Regular."}
{"text":"It was a hot day and my friends and I needed some drinks to cool down. We were pleasantly surprised by the cafe's décor and outdoor patio. It's very minimalistic but definitely very nice. 

Since there was a sign advertising cheap iced tea, we decided to give it a try. I ordered the english breakfast iced tea and my friend ordered the blueberry iced tea. I have to say that the drinks really weren't anything special. It tasted like cool (not cold), watered down tea. After overdosing on simple syrup, I still couldn't taste much difference. The free mint water they were giving out had more taste.

I can see people usually go here for the lattes and not really for iced tea so I'm just going to say that if you're looking for iced tea, don't go here."}
{"text":"Was accidentally charged on my PayPal account app after visiting here and checking in. Suffice to say, I sent a quick email explaining the situation and the management took care of everything promptly and professionally. Not to mention, they have kick-ass coffee, make a mean americano and have some great goodies to go along with your java."}
{"text":"Always great to have a new coffee shop in the area, but this one is a mixed bag:

Pros:
+Nice, open inviting space.  Lots of light, spaces to sit and work or chat.
+Always very friendly staff.

Cons:
-Coffee and latte's just aren't very good.  They seem to be doing all the fancy schmancy coffee steps necessary: complicated brewing, latte art, etc; however, the flavour just isn't there.  I had one of the most bland latte's of my life here recently with milk that had been burnt.  The coffee is also somehow not taking me to flavour town.
-Tiny sizes.  \"Regular\" appears to be about 8 oz.  That would be fine for an individual pour-over or a latte reflecting Australian flat white quality, but it misses the mark here.  Prices are consistent with what other shops charge for a larger portion.

OVERALL, I'll give it a couple more tries, but as of right now, I'm underwhelmed by the beverages and recommend Moonbean, Pamenar, or Jimmy's for a superior cup in Kensington."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorites. For co-working in Toronto, one of the best. Great coffee, tables, plenty of plugs. A giant chalkboard...friendly staff and so close to the park ( good for dogs). About as close as you can get to the TTC."}
{"text":"I took some out of town guests here for a light breakfast recently.  I had not tried it before, despite its proximity to my home.

I cannot agree with the high ratings of other reviewers.  Coffee was mediocre, selection of snacks is very limited, my guest's mocha was lousy, and in some apparent pandering to organic PC correctness, they seem not to offer sucralose or other artificial sweetener.  Service was ditzy.  

Sorry, but I'd have to stick with Starbuck's for the time being."}
{"text":"Lovely little place. The food, the drinks the service are all top notch."}
{"text":"There are so many cafes in Kensington Market, and yet there have been so many times I've come with friends and struggled to find an empty table (even on a weekday afternoon)!! On one such day, I had already tried Fika, Jimmy's, and Cafe Pamemar with no luck. Enter the recently opened Cafe Novo which saved the day. There is ample seating, including a large communal table at the back. 

The vibe is cozy and quiet -- perfect for studying, reading, colouring in a colouring book (saw a woman doing this when I went!), or catching up with friends. There is even a chess table at the back if you feel so inclined. In addition to selling great coffee/tea drinks, they also sell some gift items and printed tanks/t-shirts. I had a toasty almond tea latte, which is a pretty pink colour and has a nice delicate flavour (not too sweet)."}
{"text":"This was a nice spot! A whole extra star for the awesome hot apple cider and the water cooler with mint in it. This is a warm, comfy little hippy place with lots of fair trade coffee and vegan goods. 

I had a chocolate cupcake but it was a close call with the vegan pumpkin cupcake. Their price list is actually on their website. Try the meringues -- they're 55 cents each and the money goes to charity. This month's charity is Movember. I didn't even think I liked meringues but I had to try one, and it was really lovely.

There's lots of seating inside but it'll probably be full at noon on a Saturday. They encourage the use of reusable mugs, and even let you store your own there if you visit frequently. Wish it was closer to home!"}
{"text":"Has lost stars with me because they don't offer artificial sweetener anymore. I'm really sorry, I like the drinks, the ambiance, but not giving me the option of having a calorie-free sweetener (they told me it was \"too expensive\") is not reasonable for me. 

I'll go to next door Starbucks."}
{"text":"Plenty of space. They could pack in more tables or chairs but it's nice to be in a place with a fair bit of elbow room. A great amount of natural light. I only drink the coffees, and they taste fine.  Try the lemon-cornflake cookies.  There's a backyard patio where you can soak in the rays, but I prefer the interior where the AC is sweet, especially in the always-warm Kensington."}
{"text":"Customer service poor. Girl working behind bar was busy looking at her phone so when I called out to her and get her attention she unapologetically came over asked what I wanted. I ordered a basic cap and this is what I got... Coffee tastes burnt had a sour taste also and you could tell this place is just another hole in the ground."}
{"text":"Located in High Park, Cafe Novo is a popular place for locals to hang out or do their work. When I was there from 10 AM until 4 PM on a Saturday in order to catch up on my school work, I realized there was no shortage of customers coming in and out at every hour. A lot of cafes tend to die down at certain times of the day, but this one was busy throughout, which I found most impressive. There was also a front patio, great for those summer days to enjoy the scenery of the park.

The cafe sells local art as well. They generally sell art pieces from a couple of different artists, having them on display for a couple of months before switching them up. When I was visiting, they were selling inked art by Matt Smart (which I was unable to find a website or link to) and handmade art from Butterfly Tree (www.butterfly-tree.com).

So what is my take on the cafe? I'm not a huge fan of the decor past the counter since I am a keener for aesthetically pleasing interior. However, I do like the seating area at the very front because it gives a nice view of High Park. I think it's cute that one of their walls has a blackboard for customers to doodle and write on. There are also some board games and books in the corner at the back for people to enjoy.

I happened to get a latte au miel for this visit. The difference between a latte and a latte au miel is the espresso is poured over the honey in order to change the taste. It definitely gave a hint of sweetness, which I liked. And the one thing that always stood out to me about the cafe is the fact they have a jug of mint water, haha."}

Drink: Large Mocha

Atmoshphere: Laid-back, spacious with nice staff and a plentiful amount of tables, as well as free wi-fi!

Verdict: Good.Their mocha was good, but I am not exactly a coffee expert, although I will say it's not exactly memorable in much sense, but it does have a nice coffee aftertaste, and I feel more awake, HA! I absolutely love the space because it is just so BIG and simplistic which is what I love about coffee shops. I am currently here right now. I bought an Indie Coffee Passport here and I think you should all too and give this place a visit. Great environment to work.

Side Note: What I do NOT like about this place is that I have 2 flies surrounding me and trying to get a taste of my coffee and hair. NOT COOL, MAN."}
{"text":"I lived a block from here for years and desperately wanted an indie coffee shop, it figures now that I am gone a charming shop opens with friendly owners. Alas, when I want a caffeine jolt before a walk through High Park, this is the place. Good coffee, hot cider and moderately tasty baked goods make this location worth a stop. The side patio is a great place to read a book and people watch."}
{"text":"1. Intelligentisia, Sam James, Te Aro,  (soy latte)
2. Crema, Green grind (soy latte), Ideal coffee (chai latte)
3. TAN, Green beanery  (soy latte), Cafe Novo (soy hot chocolate)
4. Mascot (soy latte)
5. Bisogno Espresso Bar (soy latte)
6. Tampered Press (chai latte)

Again, this is a 3.5.  I really wish I can do half stars!!!  I came here late in the evening so I wasn't wanting coffee.  Their hot chocolate wasn't too sweet and since I had it with soy (something I usually don't order with chocolate), the taste was slighly unusual.  Overall, I would order it again.  However, I would probably order my usual soy latte next time.

My bf got the mochacchino (I think I spelled that right) and I thought it was very delish!  I usually don't like mocha but this was good stuff!"}
{"text":"I think it is a great place to enjoy coffee. The environment is welcoming and quite, however, the wifi is not good. The coffee is great, compare to some other places I've been to. Also, the food looks good, organic, but I haven't tried."}
{"text":"Five stars because I have absolutely nothing to complain about.

I truly miss Cafe Novo in Bloor West Village, but decided that it'd be a worthwhile trek to Kensington for this wonderful cafe, noting that it's probably one of the only cafes in Toronto that uses organic milk. 

I came here three times this week, and do not regret my visits one bit! Each day, I've had the pleasure of being served by three separate employees, and each of them were incredibly kind, funny, and welcoming. Although the cafe is still setting up and finding its groove in its new location, the food and the service seems to have nestled in comfortably. The space is beautiful and cozy. Music not too loud, which is always a bonus. 

I've tried their cappuccino, latte, and an Earl Grey tea. All very delicious. The espresso drinks were velvety, warm, and homey (is that even applicable to a drink???). Tea is steeped with love and care, and not just tossed into a bag and thrown at you without attention. Cafe Novo also carries several vegan + gluten free desserts (cookies are from Bunner's, I believe), so all my conscious and paleo friends...grab a bite and stay a while.

Prices are incredibly reasonable. I was pleasantly surprised at the prices for drinks using organic milk (organic milk costs more than double the price of conventional milk). How amazing is that? I have no idea how they keep their prices so low, but I'm not complaining! 

Will probably frequent Cafe Novo at least once a week, not to catch up on readings or pretend to get any work done on my laptop, but simply to sip up a frothy, dreamy cappuccino, undisturbed by the nuisances of city life."}
{"text":"I've been here 2-3 times as I appreciate the location    (Augusta & College) and commitment to sustainability.  Large open space and definitely fond of the decor. I was hoping to become a regular but the service and more importantly the coffee felt below average. It would be nice if they introduced more sweet treats or other nibbles to the menu - as I felt options were lacking. I will be reminding myself not to come here again despite the inner voice that always promises potential!"}
{"text":"Thanks for Indie Coffee Passport!! I really enjoy my visit to Cafe Novo.

Last time when I was here, it was so cold....... and I didn't realize how nice and big the patio is!!!! 

And not only how spacious the patio is, it is also 'Dog Friendly\"!!! Great for pets and their owners... nothing beat spending some quality time with your flurry friends and sipping coffee and enjoy High Park area neighbourhood!!

Cappuncino though was weak, but the set up and the environment totally made up for that!! Maybe I will have some loose leaf tea instead next time!"}
{"text":"I knew this place was near the High Park TTC station but I didn't realise how close. As I exited the subway station, I barely had time to fish out my smartphone to map this place, before I spotted it. Great location!

When you enter, you are IMMEDIATELY faced with a smiling barista. I've never been to a café where the bar is so close to the door and it was a bit overwhelming. I typically like to look around, survey the scene, scope out any \"tasties\" as the fellas say, then order my drink. I didn't have that luxury here, so I merely blurted out my order for a soy latte.

As you venture in you are greeted with an airy space with avocado-coloured plaster walls, a long bar, a communal table and plenty of seating. I grabbed my latte (which was HUGE by the way) and grabbed a seat at the communal table. The table faces a large chalkboard, which could come in handy if you are here working with a group on your plans for world domination.

Sadly, like so many other Toronto establishments in the winter, this place got frigid quickly everytime the door was opening so I barely got to stay for more than 25 minutes. But I definitely enjoyed my stay. Can't wait to come back in the summer.

Obligatory Title Pun: Like a champagne super NOVO.

Menu Readability: I didn't even look, I just order the first drink that came to mind.

Need to mention: I hear they have a swell patio.

What this place teaches me about myself: I'm a wuss when it comes to the cold."}
{"text":"Super cute decor.  Incredibly awesome looking coffee devices (Can't you tell that is the expert in me speaking?)

The barista was quick to recommend the cheesecake brownie & the cinnamon roll in the Baked Goods department.  The brownie = supreme!  The cinnamon roll?  Good, but a little dry for me.  We -were- there at around 4pm, so I can't fault anyone too much.

I liked that they had both a community table & separate seating.  The large chalkboard behind us was covered in silly and endearing messages that were a good add to our conversation.

My white cafe mocha was served in a different type of glass than I am accustomed to (one usually for cold beverages) which threw me off visually but made it fun to drink.

I will definitely return as it would be a great destination from our place to get some fresh air (& some yummyness)."}
