{"text":"Really really bad. I'm a fan of Paradise, so was happy to find a light meal before our flight. The crew behind the counter were eating, and talking loudly about how they're going to go smoke. Nobody was enthusiastic to help us. Finally, and ironically, we noticed our cookie was pretty hard and dry. We heard a commotion behind the counter as all of the employees rushed about yelling \"The health inspector is coming! Throw everything away!\" They then threw away all of the pastries.. one of which we just ate... This is pretty dang bad haha. Try another restaurant."}

{"text":"I have always loved Paradise Bakery at Sky Harbor. This one needs management review. I fly out of Mesa Gateway regularly. I  like to order the Chicken Caesar Salad for the plane. Done it many times over the last 7 years at Phoenix Sky Harbor. Was disappointed about what I received for my $10 at this location. It was only romaine, chicken, and big fat (hard to eat) croutons...nothing else. The box wasn't even full for the large salad. Whoever heard of a Caesar Salad without any Parmesan?! I was not offered any options to add nuts, sunflower seeds, tortilla strips, corn salsa.   https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_salad  I asked for a paper bag to carry it since I had a purse and two tote bags. The person who made the salad said \"I don't have bags.\"    What's that about when people are lugging things on the plane?! Then when I get to my gate, there are 3 men sitting next to me eating PBakery breakfast sandwiches each with a bag. The salad cost twice what the breakfast sandwiches cost.   Earlier this year, I went there to get a Chicken Caesar as well for a 7:30am flight. The person told me, \"We don't have chicken this early in the day. It doesn't get thawed until lunch hour.\"  What's that about?! My flight is 3 1/2 hours, so I was ordering for lunch.   They get long lines before flights take off, so it's not like you can go back in line to get something corrected. I recommend a suggestion box for management to pick up on quality issues."}
