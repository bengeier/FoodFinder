{"text":"Unexpectedly good food served from the fanciest shipping container in Montreal.  Delicious fusion tacos (the vegetarian had curried lentils,  cauliflower,  and sweet potatoes) along with better than expected guacamole and hearty tortilla chips.  Coupled with a beautiful view of the old port it makes for a great night out."}
{"text":"I had the beef taco and a beer. I didn't find the staff friendly at all and the taco itself was very bland; had to pour hotsauce over it, and i'm no fan of bottled hotsauce...  It was definitely a disappointing experience given how gorgeous the setting was."}
{"text":"While easy to hop off your bike and have lunch at taco box, it really wasn't all that good. Actually the chorizo tacos are perfectly fine. Not the best I've had but tasty.   The issue i had was with the duck taco.  Sounds good from the description, confit, pickles, hosin; sounds like a nice Asian riff. But just not good.  The pickles are a fairly strong dill and totally over power all other flavors.  The hosin is no where to be found.  Plus the tortilla just disintegrated.  While the ones used with the chorizo held up fine. So $5.50 for what tasted like a pickle taco just didn't work for me.  Plus the chips that came with the \"combo\" were just this side of stale. Really regretted this stop.  Would be two stars except the chorizo are perfectly fine.  My advice....just have the chorizo or walk next door and get something else.  Plus you are kind of paying more for location than something tasty."}
{"text":"I was forced to stop and take shelter at Taco Box during a sudden monsoon of a rainstorm that drove me off the bike trail. Plus, it was close to supper time and I was getting hungry. Taco Box totally turned my rainstorm around!   This is a little food box kiosk, next to a few other food box kiosks dotted along the canal. They seriously have the BEST lobster tacos in the universe. That's all I had: lobster tacos x 2. I got the combo which also came with corn chips and guacamole. The guacamole was good but man, those corn chips... not so much. So, I would highly recommend just buying an extra taco if you're extra peckish, and never mind the combo option. It's more cost effective AND SATISFYING.  Also: Great staff - super friendly, good vibes.  Reasonable prices. Excellent outdoor seating.  Folks, I need more of those lobster tacos and I don't even like lobster *that* much."}
{"text":"I had the tacos and they just didn't taste good. The kids working at the place were friendly and nice. But I can't say the food is good. Almost no meat in the tacos. Disappointed..."}
{"text":"Pitiful tiny, tiny $5-6 tacos (see pictures). Tasted like carton. This place is a joke.   Employs teenagers during the summer, kids were nice and doing a fine job though."}
