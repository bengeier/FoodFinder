{"text":"What a fun, unique, tasty treat! My employer had Wrap It Up come to our office for a recess and it was a huge hit. Besides the fun games, like cornhole, mini golf and life sized Jenga, the wraps were AHH-MAZING! I tried the meatloaf and chicken adobo. Unbelievable. Really awesome concept and even better tasting food! I hope to track down the truck one day soon and do it again!  P.S. The loaded tots are ridiculous!"}
{"text":"The veggie burger wrap is superb! The employers are super friendly, and the service is fast."}
{"text":"I hired the Wrap It Up Food Truck for an employee appreciation event.  Chef Anthony, Shannon and Laura were a fantastic group to work with and helped get the employees engaged in games while they wanted for their wraps.  Every single one of my employees raved about the wraps and left happy and full!  Thank you to Wrap It Up Food Truck for a great employee appreciation event and delicious wraps."}
{"text":"Arrived at our graduation party and was a huge hit! EVERYONE loved their wraps and it was easy for me as the mother of the graduate."}
{"text":"RUMOR HAS IT that James Comey, former Director of the FBI, has applied at the Wrap It Up Food Truck for employment and a wrap.  Again, we can't confirm or deny this, but I read it in the New York Times - choice media outlet for leaks of Director Comey.  And have you seen President Trump speaking in the Rose Garden?  Yup, huuuuuge wraps in the background.  Even That Sean Spicer guy, denying the undeniable facts for President Trump, says he may or may not have eaten at the Wrap It Up Food Truck when the truck was at The White House for young Baron Trump's birthday.   Food good!  Food hot!  Food ginormous!  What more can an American ask for besides lower taxes, healthcare and a President who isn't orange?"}
{"text":"Say goodbye to boring lunches. Say goodbye to uninspired dinners. Say hello to Wrap it Up Food Truck. This mobile masterpiece has a menu so versatile it's sure to please every palate. I love places that takes a classic like meatloaf and breathes new life into it. I recently tried the meatloaf wrap with chorizo meatloaf, onion rings, corn, and gravy and I could have died happy after the first bite! So yummy! I'm also such a fan of tater tots (hello childhood favorite!) and they take tater tots to a new level with tons of flavorful toppings!   So ditch your boring salad or sandwich and stop by this place ASAP. Life is meant to be lived people!"}
{"text":"My place of business had Wrap It Up Food Truck come to our facility last week for a free employee lunch.  What a great idea for increased employee morale, offer them free food, and best of all from a food truck.  The food truck employee that I interacted with was sweet as pie.  I had a little wait because there were people in front of me, but I didn't mind.  They were pumping out good music and offering tater tots to tide me over until my wrap was ready.    Food was ok.  I wasn't blown away by the food I got, but I can't complain too much because the food was clearly very fresh and well-prepared.  My fellow co-workers got different menu items and seemed very happy with their selections.  This was my first encounter eating from a food-truck and I can't say I wouldn't do it again.  Wrap It Up was fun, I liked the menu selection, and the people / service was good.  Give them a try and Wrap It Up for lunch!"}
{"text":"Buffalo chicken mac and cheese that you eat with your hands.. As if that isn't enough, the chorizo meatloaf is indescribable! I don't even like meatloaf and it's my favorite! We definitely love Chef Anthony!!"}
{"text":"Slowest food truck ever. It took about 30 minutes from the time of ordering to the time I got my food. The food was not worth the wait. Not that the food was bad, but it was certainly nothing special."}
{"text":"OMG.....chicken mac and cheese wrap, and loaded tots. I have died and gone to tasty, tasty carb heaven!!!!!!!  My son got the pulled pork and said that was really good too. I can't wait till the come back!!!  If you see this truck rolling, chase it like you are 7years old and it is the ice cream man!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've only had their food once so I can't give them 5/5 but I will say my experience with them at Crocker Parks food truck competition was pleasant. The chicken wrap was huge. It did lack spice and had little taste but was still filling. The staff was really nice as well."}
{"text":"This is the best food truck I've tried so far.  They catered a company event at edgewater beach and it was fantastic.  You really can't go wrong with any of the menu choices; meatloaf wrap, veggie wrap, adobo wrap...the best is the buffalo chicken wrap with the really flavorful Mac and cheese.  It has a lot of flavor but isn't too salty or spicy.   The employees are quick and friendly.  If this truck had a permanent brick n mortar location, it would definitely be packed!"}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite food truck! If I am at an event and this food truck is there you can forget about me eating anywhere else. I cannot say enough how much I love them! I have gone to events in the area just because they had planned to be there. Anyways on to the food! The buffalo chicken mac and cheese wrap is a delicious creation. The chicken is crispy and fried, the mac and cheese taste like and old family recipe of baked mac and cheese, it has the right amount of heat with the buffalo sauce, and the add Fritos inside the wrap for the perfect crunch. I've also tried they tots several different ways... my personal favorite is Cajun tots with queso but they have so many different combos you can come up with. I have never been disappointed when hitting up this food truck!"}
