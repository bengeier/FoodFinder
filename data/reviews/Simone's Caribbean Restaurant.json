{"text":"SOUP! I love soup!! I had their beef and pumpkin twice and it was very yummy-great spicy flavours, beef, dumplings and sweet pumpkin.  I work close by and have been there twice in the past few  weeks.  I'll be going back soon.  If you are on the Danforth, definitely check it out.  Their prices are quite affordable as well-small jerk chicken meal (which is also good is quite large and inexpensive at 8 bucks)."}
{"text":"It is impossible to describe the food at this restaurant. It's mom's home cooking kicked up one tiny elegant notch. I call it classy comfort food. We can never decide what to order so we usually order 4-5 items on the menu...with the serving sizes, it ends up being way too much food but the prices are great so we can afford to indulge a little and have another bite for the next days lunch! 

My only criticism is that there are hornets and mosquitos inside that makes it hard to relax. But I guess it's coming from the lovely back patio. My only suggestion would be to close the patio door. Aside from that the service and atmosphere is lovely. Good bye Real Jerk. Simone's in the house!!"}
{"text":"Seriously the most amazing Jamaican food I've ever had! We decided to have dinner at Simone's one night. None of us have ever been there so, we all decided to order a different meal so we can try it out. We started with the fish cakes. Came to the table hot, tasty, with just the right amount of spice to get you drooling. I ordered the oxtail. Meat falling off the bone delicious! A friend ordered the Ackee and salt fish and johnnycakes. Phenomenal! If you've never had Ackee and salt fish before, you need to try it. The johnnycakes were also good. Another person had the curried goat. Also delicious but just remember it's not Indian curry which is heavy in turmeric. We ordered a large jerk chicken to share but we only had a little bite each and took it home. The portions were generous (mains come ins small and large sizes, and we all ordered small) .Unfortunately, they did not have any black cake for dessert. But the fried plantains gave us that touch of sweetness we were craving. Amazing!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. My partner picked up takeout the other day. Two chicken rotis. When we sat down to eat them they both contained pieces of oxtail or beef, which was not what we ordered. Neither of us eat red meat so it all unfortunately went in the garbage. My partner called them to explain we had gotten the wrong order and the woman on the phone was very argumentative. She went back to the restaurant with pictures of the wrong order today after work to get our money back (we weren't about to drive back to Simone's when the problem happened in the first place so we waited until we were in the area again). The woman gave her a very hard time about getting our money back and used the reasoning that it was due to religious reasons. The woman at the restaurant ended up kicking my partner out of the restaurant. I feel frustrated and angry that they couldn't admit to their mistake and solve the problem without stress, if they had then we would have been return customers. We will never go back and we will not recommend this restaurant to any of our friends. There are plenty of places to get carribean food without being mistreated. Don't take the risk- go elsewhere."}
{"text":"The food tasted great, the menu had so many good options, the atmosphere was calm and welcoming and played good music, and the staff was friendly, attentive and professional.  One of the only places to get good Caribbean food on the Danforth."}
{"text":"Dinner was fantastic and 'right sized'. The wife had Jerk Chicken with Rice & Beans while I Stewed Beef and Johnny Cakes. Both were delicious and we look forward to returning for more. The only let down was the lack of Rum Cake which we will return for tomorrow."}
{"text":"Simone's had good jerk chicken. Seems to be a local neighborhood spot a lot of people come in and pick up there food."}
{"text":"What a great night!  We had a large party and everyone enjoyed the meal and service.  My red snapper was delicious.  Kuddos to the chef.  I would recommend this place for anyone who wants authentic caribbean fair."}
{"text":"After a long walk through the Danforth, we went to Simone's for some jerk chicken as I've heard nothing but good things about this place (we were somewhat nearby as well)

I ordered the jerk chicken dinner and my girlfriend ordered the stewed chicken dinner - i must say, this is definitely one of the best carribean restaurants I've been to! The jerk chicken is actually somewhat spicy, and has a kick to it! It comes with some curry (gravy) which mixes really well with the rice and peas (beans). The cole slaw was a bit too watery for my liking, but was very good nonetheless!

The meat was fall-off-the-bone cooked, but not overcooked. The spices were definitely present, you can tell it was seasoned thoroughly, there wasn't a piece that was bland!

It had some green peppers to it, which I liked. My girlfriends stewed chicken had yellow and red peppers in it, which I thought was awesome!

Honestly, Simone's has set the bar ridiculously high to the point where all the local carribean places I go to will never be the same now. Will definitely be back when I find myself walking past the plethora of Greek taverns!

Price was a little high in my opinion.. Quantity was good over all, but I would expect a little more rice and cole slaw for the $30 for 2 meals. The other reviews kind of exaggerate the quantity, but the amount of chicken you get was definitely on the higher side! 

5 stars all the way!"}
{"text":"Great flavours, relaxed service with a friendly smile. We ordered two Jerk chicken with Jonny cakes and fried plantains. Fresh, hot and flavourful, side of slaw and a red stripe made the meal complete. Will visit again."}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for Jamaican food this is the place to go. We had the Jerk chicken and it was nicely seasoned while not being too spicy. Also tried the Ox tail with Peas and rice. Very tasty gravy and great flavor. Wish there were more in a large order. Also tried the Goat Roti and it was really enjoyable. 
The portion size was adequate. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. 
Great back patio. 
I absolutely love the Johnny cakes. 
When they have the homemade ginger beer it's an awesome treat. 
I have tried the jerk and oxtail and whole fish and it's all been very good. 
The Danforth needs great food and variety like this."}
{"text":"Best curry goat ever! And beef patties too! Highly recommend! Also, I love how the ceiling is painted sky blue to mimic the Caribbean sky."}
{"text":"The wait for the food is sooooo slow....but then when i had their food, I no longer care how long it takes cause ...DAMNNNNN.......the food is sooooo DAMNNNNNN GOOOOOD! I don't normally order veggie dish but when I had gone to Simone I decided to try it.  I order the Channa and Calaloo roti and i almost cried cause it was the best roti.  The flavour was crazy out of this world.  Plus their backyard patio is probably one of the best, it makes you feel like you are in Jamaica.  Since that roti experience, I've been back 3 times in the same week."}
{"text":"Love love love this place, I remember when they opened on the danforth. Their jerk chicken is really good, home made and the small size is portioned well. I recommend it with coslaw  and rice and peas. Their curry chicken is tasty as well. And same with their 'aoki' (the yellow Jamaican food fish with vegetables). Lastly I also recommend their run and raisin cakes. They make them fresh! 

FYI: They also have a cute patio at the back of the restaurant."}
{"text":"The food is definitely 5 stars. Delicious jerk chicken and goat curry! Get the bananas and dumplings as your side. The only reason I might give 4 instead of 5 was because the food took about half an hour. That being said, it was a Saturday night. They were quite busy which is a good sign!"}
{"text":"Hands down, the best I've had in Toronto!  First time I went, had the jerk chicken.  Great flavor; fresh and tender chicken.   Second time,  I had the curry goat and it was just as good and tasty. 

This is going to be my 'go-to' spot for Caribbean food now.  And funny thing is that it's located on ghe Danforth in Greektown.  OPA!"}
{"text":"I have a couple go-to spots for Caribbean take-out (Tropical Joe's at Gerard Square Mall) and the Real Jerk.  Yesterday I had a monster craving hit for roti but when my two usual spots were closed I remembered seeing the great reviews I had read about Simone's.  What's crazy is that this place is much closer to where I live.  Now that I have found it, the other two are taking a back seat.  

Keep in mind, I ordered take-out so I didn't have the full dining experience.  However, there were a number of other diner's who all seemed to be happily eating and chatting away with some nice island music in the background.  We'll come here to eat in for sure.

I ordered one chicken and one beef roti.  I believe they were both around the $11/$12 mark and worth every penny.  They are PACKED with stewy goodness so my wife and I ended up splitting the beef roti for lunch and the chicken roti for dinner.  I wouldn't have minded if they were had a little more heat but the spices did taste great.  Everything seemed really fresh and made with care.  They were delicious.  I'll be going back again soon to check out the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Heard about this spot through a friend. I had the pumpkin beef soup which was delicious! I also ordered the beef stew w/ peas and rice. Deep rich flavours and I really enjoyed what I had room for. I ordered the small size, packed up what I couldn't finish and there was enough for my dinner the next day. I think it was 12 bucks for the stew which i got 2 meals out of.. You can't beat that. I will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Best ackee and salt fish that I've ever had including in Jamaica and at Jamaican friends' houses. 
Went with a large group ~ 30 people -  so we filled the whole restaurant but the staff  were so calm & professional  & everyone was served in a reasonable amount of time - I did not hear one negative from the group.  And the chef was gracious enough to sit & give me her ackee recipie.
Any time I'm in the area will certainly go back - so many dishes to try!"}
{"text":"Soooooooo good. All of your Trini favourites in one spot. Flavourful food, great service and comfortable atmosphere. I miss Toronto! Will be back whenever I can."}
{"text":"It's like being at someone's backyard cookout! The place could use some upgrades in aesthetics, but the food was f... Amazing! Doesn't make any sense why the jerk chicken tasted so good!"}
{"text":"I am currently nursing a substantial food baby from the channa roti I just devoured from Simone's.  It comes with a light, creamy and sweet coleslaw.  The channa filling is nicely spiced, packed with chickpeas and veggies, and rich-tasting.  And oh, the roti shell!  Tender, warm, generous. 

Simone is understated but nice, and her restaurant is a cozy operation - it deserves to be full every night.  I look forward to exploring the menu further, though have to be honest that it will be hard to rip myself from the channa roti."}
{"text":"Excellent food. The jerk chicken is juicy and not too spicy. Very tasty. The rice & pea is moist but not mushy; it can be enjoyed without gravy if you please. The ackee & salt fish is the best in GTA. Hands down. The fried dumpling is hot & crisp. I can't tell you where this little giant restaurant came from but their chefs rival some of Toronto's best chefs. Sometimes there's no good reason to fix or change \"tried & true\"."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I are on vacation in Toronto and decided to stop by this place! We have never had any Caribbean food but this place was awesome. Usually I am a picky eater but I loved the BBQ chicken and rice so much, we came back for a second time. We had great service and great food! Love this place."}
{"text":"We were just browsing around found this cute little restaurant grabbed a bite amazing fresh ingredients they use! We'll go back! Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Tried the goat curry and jerk chicken on two different occasions. Didn't disappoint. Meat falls off the bone for the goat. I'd easily say it's the best goat curry I've tried in the city. Jerk chicken is very good as well. Worth the try. Happy I did."}
{"text":"I'm not an expert on Caribbean food but this pace was really good

I read the reviews and had to try it 

The oxtail and jerk chicken were perfectly moist and rice and beans were cook perfect

Great service will come again"}
{"text":"Over Caribana weekend I checked out several highly rated Carribean restaurants, but Simone's was the only one I'd never been to before, which is odd because it's closest to my home.

I was raised on real home cooked Jamaican food made by my mom and aunties and uncles, and to tell the truth, I've always been at least a little disappointed by every Caribbean restaurant I've tried. Figured that was inevitable because that food for me has become idealized through the lens of fond family memories. Plus I've been a pretty fussy little eater my whole life, and I can remember the looks of disgust from my island relatives as they watched 6-year-old me carefully dissect my dinner plate, trimming anything even remotely nasty (fat, gristle, anything I didn't recognize or like the texture of) and putting it on a separate little plate. I spent time one summer travelling through Maine with migrant Jamaican pickers, and eating their hot pot at night, which I thought was delicious, after I fastidiously removed every bit of unrecognizable organ meat in it.

And no freaking way would i ever touch any goat meat. I understand they are delicious, but once you've spent an afternoon watching a goat eat a rusty can while somehow urinating on it's own stomach....no. Just no. 

I'm saying I'm a spoiled brat who can get weirded out when food gets too real.

However.

From the moment I looked at Simone's menu and saw Cream of Wheat on the menu I knew I was somewhere special. My mom used to make me that fine ground white porridge most mornings, with a little salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and sweetened condensed milk. I've never seen it on a menu before. The bowl they served me at Simone's was perfect, better than I remember it. Not lumpy ( which is tricky with this porridge) and with a perfect balance of flavors that surpassed my memories of it. I also had the saltfish and ackee served with rice and peas (actually they are kidney beans not peas, but nobody says rice and beans for some reason) and for the very first time I was compelled to sit and appreciate every delicate forkful of that rice because it also was perfect. Neither sticky nor mushy nor dry, every grain so nicely flavored you just need to savor it. By this point I was losing my mind, and I was seriously thinking of booking a flight to Jamaica. I hadn't even had the main course.  Do I need to say the saltfish and ackee were fantastic?

I tried my friend's chicken roti and it was, like everything else at Simone's, the best example of that traditional dish that I have ever put in my mouth. Nothing nasty, only nice nice.

I can also highly recommend the banana fritters. But listen, it's quite an extensive menu for an island food joint, and I'm committed to eating all of it now.

Simply outstanding."}
{"text":"Probably the best vegan/vegetarian roti I've ever had and that's saying a lot since I am from the Caribbean and was raised on curry and roti. They delivered in an hour. The Johnny cakes were SO good! We also had a great (but so sweet) homemade ginger beer that was amazing. Great vegan fare and excellent service! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Tried a small order of the jerk chicken with rice and peas and green salad (they were out of sweet potato salad that day).  Pretty good stuff although not the best I've tried.  But I do appreciate how the food was fresh (especially the salad) and jerk chicken and rice and peas were piping hot.  Service was fine."}
{"text":"Albert you've been replaced. Years I've been going to Albert's Real Jamaican but now Simone's is my fave. The curry goat was spiced well, mansize portion, fall off the bone tender meat & perfectly cooked rice/peas. And the coleslaw wasn't cloyingly sweet like some others. Nice homey feel like you're eating at someone's house. I appreciated that they use cloth napkins for their setting, nice touch. Thanks for making me feel welcome & special Simone. See you soon."}
{"text":"Simone's Caribbean Restaurant is a great addition to Toronto's iconic Greek-town. This Caribbean gem brought back the fondest memories of mom's home cooking. The codfish fritters, rice and peas served with stewed chicken or oxtail or curry chicken or Escovitch won't disappoint the most selective or apprehensive palate. The Sorrel Rum Punch was an inventive, refreshing beverage to complete the fine dining experience. Most certainly returning with friends, family and clients but mostly looking forward to reminiscing with mom."}
{"text":"I got the Goat roti with channa and a bowl of coslaw. I never expected the roti to be such a huge portion. It's a bit spicy with a few large bones but it taste great! The beautiful and splendid experience was utterly fantastic."}
{"text":"Delicious veggie roti. Flavourful and fresh.  Nicely spiced. Very cheerful service. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Finally...a restaurant that gets Caribbean food on point. We ended up finding this hidden gem last minute on Mother's Day and were pleasantly surprised with the impeccable service/delicious food. The portion sizes were proper. Last but not least, my daughters were especially impressed by the tlc given by our waitress, Marsha. She made the experience one that would definitely make us go back. Can't wait to return in the near future."}
{"text":"I work in the neighbourhood, walked by this place a dozen times, then finally went in to try it. 3+ years later this is where I come 1x week for Caribbean food.  It's always fresh & delicious. I've had the jerk chicken, jerk chicken salad, johnny cakes, plantain, chicken roti, pumpkin soup and it's always been on point.  It's consistently amazingly on point!  
The ambiance is comfortable & welcoming.  
Excellent service, always friendly & accommodating staff.
It doesn't get any better than Simone's!  Try it, you'll love it."}
{"text":"Had the chicken roti and curry chicken with bananas/dumplings. The food was amazing! The meat was very well seasoned and the hot sauce i asked for on the side had a serious kick. The service was excellent and atmosphere was warm and relaxing. Lots of older Jamaicans in the restaurant which attests to the authenticity of the food. 

Have had roti and jamaican food all over the city and this is definitely in my top 3."}
{"text":"Honestly, the BEST DAMN GOAT ROTI EVER!!!!!  You can taste that the curry and roti skins are made with love and passion.  Fresh & Tasty.  Finally a good carib roti shop around here!  I've been to Jamacia 5 times now, but still this is the best!  Thank you Simone for bringing delicious roti to the Danforth!!!"}
{"text":"The oxtail and rice and peas was excellent. I had a small dinner and it was plenty! Delicious! Taste like home. I also recommend the beef soup."}
{"text":"I had my first roti at a restaurant that shall remain nameless. It was bland, and I thought maybe vegetarian roti were just like that. 

Until I had Simone's vegetable roti. Amazing! Callaloo, chick peas, other delicious ingredients and a fabulous sauce made a complex and mild flavour that I finished way fast. And there were three other vegetarian roti on the menu.

The decor is tropical and intimate, the service casual and comfortable. A great local find."}
{"text":"That Umbrella Guy @ Simone's Caribbean

Service was great. Waitresses were friendly and explained what the dishes were since I wasn't particularly familiar with this kind of cuisine. Things like \"Jack Cakes\" and \"Ackee\" were new terms to me.

I ordered the \"Ackee and Saltfish\" with a side of dumplings, having never heard of the dish before and seeing that it is the \"national dish of Jamaica\". Personally I found the salt fish a bit too salty, though I mean...it is salt fish I guess, so some degree of saltiness is to be expected.

The ackee had an interested flavour with a smooth, scrambled-egg-like texture, but when it was mixed with the salty juices in the dish, the salty flavour was too overpowering and I didn't like it as much.

The dumplings were the caribbean variety, so it was just flour on flour with no other fillings.
It was ok, but I liked the jack cakes that someone else ordered more.

I'm sure the dish is great; the flavours just didn't work for me since it was all too salty.
Next time I'll try getting their chicken."}
{"text":"Ive been meaning to try this place and was disappodinted. We waited for like 10 min to be seated even though the restaurant was half empty. Then we asked for three times for water and our glasses were always empty.  the couple next to us sit for like 10min and didnt get ordered and they just threw the menu on floor and left. there were four waitresses at 3pm, i dont know what they were busy at and they seemed they didnt care.im def not coming back again"}
{"text":"Super good food with good prices. We had jerk chicken with rice and salad. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"While I've never actually been to Simone's I've had their take out brought home a number of times by my wife that works in the area.  To date I've had the jerk chicken, chicken and potato stuffed roti and the ox tail.  

The jerk chicken is done right.  I have a Trini friend that makes jerk chicken and it's pretty much the same which is spicy, fall off the bone goodness that must have been cooking for a while stewing in all that nom nom.  The jerk chicken is well spiced in that yes if you can't handle the spiciness (not necessarily hot but definitely a kick) then you probably won't enjoy this dish.  My wife can't handle too much spice so she can't eat this dish but damn it's good and I wish I could explain to her what she's missing.  

The chicken roti is also good but I don't know if there's a gravy available or not but if there is I don't get any whenever she brings it home.  It's got that nice flavor and it also has a spice kick, again not necessarily hot for somebody like me but yes the flavor is there.  I found some pieces of chicken in here to be big and some of the white meat pieces to be large and thick which because of their size and because of how white meat is seemed to be dryer.  Still, a very good roti serving as well as great tasting.  I will ask her next time if there's gravy or not.  My wife who can't handle too much spice can eat this dish.

The ox tail is very good.  Yes it's a dish that has bones and that really fatty stewed meat not exactly fall of the bone but definitely that sticky texture that you have to work off the bones.  Yummy is an understatement.  This dish is not as spicy as the other two so my wife can eat this and enjoys it.  

Out of the 3 dishes I have had it's hard to say which one is my favorite but this food is great and it's a nice surprise whenever my wife comes home with Simone's food."}
{"text":"I consider myself a Jamaican food connoisseur, have really close family friends that taught me how to make a lot of their dishes.( ackee and salt fish, traditional jerk chicken, different from the one sold in stores, involves blending up various vegetables and baking it)since a young age I've constantly been making them; so when I go out to Caribbean restaurants, I tend to be very judgemental of their food. I'm happy to say that this jerk chicken is as close as I'll get to happiness when ordering Caribbean cuisine from a restaurant. Its perfectly rubbed with jerk marinade, not over baring or underwhelming. Has always been juicy never over cooked. Delicious notes of charcoal that resonates on the chicken while you're eating it, very pleasant. Rice and peas are also great, subtle hints of coconut make this dish. The chicken curry roti is the best I've had, the secret is in the roti bread itself, if that's not good the whole dish is off. Everything here is fantastic. Given that my jerk chicken takes about 3 hours to cook in the oven on low, yes it may be better but who has that kind of time anymore, as an alternative I 100% recommend and nominate simones restaurant and guarantee that you'll have the best Caribbean food from any restaurant. Service here is also fantastic and if you're not familiar with what's what on the menu they'll be more than happy to help you out."}
{"text":"My favourite roti in all of Toronto! The veggie roti is a tender dhalpouri skin so packed full of delicious, tender vegetables, I can't imagine ever finding a better one."}
{"text":"Best Jerk Chicken you can find. Very cheap, and they give you a lot of food. Even if you don't like jerk chicken, you will like it as Simone's."}
{"text":"I needed to have some delicious home-cooked Caribbean food. This was that. The stewed peas was amazing as was the chicken soup. And they have cute, sweet tarts.

The atmosphere is very cozy and there's a gorgeous patio out back I might enjoy with a beer next summer (they get points for having Dragon Stout, too).

I'll look forward to returning."}
{"text":"I will definitely be back. Great food, excellent prices, friendly staff. I have been here twice now and neither time have been disappointed. Roti and coleslaw are excellent, as are the stews.

Its a nice, casual space, with a laid back vibe.

Highly recommended!

Bonus: PATIO!"}
{"text":"That is a nice place for comfort food and big portions. The ingredient are not the best quality but this is what you get for the price. Food is tasty and small here is big. And rotisserie are huge. We also had that oxtail food which tasted good enough."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a while and decided to go this past weekend. Sooooo amazing! The food takes a little bit to come out but everything is so fresh and delicious when it comes out! One of my favorite restaurants for sure :)"}
{"text":"One of the best Rotis you can get in Toronto. Simone's has different options of meat and veggie Roti's which are huge and packed with noms. You won't regret this roti experience."}
{"text":"Very good food at a very reasonable price. Got the mutton roti. The portion is deceptively large!! Taste was good and the service was good. The beef patty in particular was brilliant."}
{"text":"Wow. This place is great!! Came on a recommendation and we were not disappointed. We had jerk chicken and curry goat and both were amazingly flavourful. Definitely recommend the Johnny cakes. Staff were friendly, place was quaint and there's a great patio in the back (which, unfortunately we didn't find out till the end but we'll be back, so all is good)."}
{"text":"I come to Toronto all the time but this was my first coming to Simone's. The atmosphere was very friendly upon being seated. It was warm and homey and the music wasn't too loud. I ordered the curried shrimp dinner with boiled banana and boiled dumplings. The wait wasn't very long since we ordered codfish fritters as appetizers! They were amazingly delicious and not greasy at all. The curried shrimp was delicious! I enjoyed every bite and definitely will be back for more on my next trip to Toronto! I ended up ordering some festivals to go as well."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch.   The food was very very good.

I had never had johnny cakes before, but we started with a couple of these, and were really glad we did; they had a great consistency, were perfectly warm, and felt right at home in our mouths. :)

I had a full order of the jerk chicken; a half order would have been enough, but how could I resist going to a full order for only $2 more?    I think it was the best jerk chicken that I have had since I was in the Caribbean 20 years ago.   As sides, I got the rice and peas (which is called \"red beans and rice\" in most places that I've frequented) and the plantains, both of which hit the spot and paired nicely with the jerk chicken.

The atmosphere is simple, so it was nice to score a table right next to the patio so we could watch the haps on the street.  

The bathroom down the stairs was clean, but could use a serious renovation....it reminded me of the bathrooms I would visit in Tijuana taco shops back in my college days.

Only downside was that it took a really really long time for the food to come out;  I overheard the woman at the table next to us tell her friend \"It didn't take anywhere near this long the last time I was here\", so hopefully this was an aberration.   I'll give them the benefit of the doubt that it was and leave my review at 4 stars, because the quality and quantity of the food for the price is definitely 4-star worthy."}
{"text":"Went here highly recommend by a close friend when visiting Toronto. I'm so glad that I went because I was greatly satisfied with my food and service. Rare you find a restaurant that everything is cooked to order which I appreciate because that way I know it's fresh. Our server Monique was awesome and funny. I ordered the oxtail and it was amazing! You could taste the love in the food. I will be coming back whenever I am in town."}
{"text":"Delicious take-out chicken roti and a side of spicy potato salad. Bravo. The space itself could use a little love."}
{"text":"I just got here and ordered. This is my second time here. First time I had goat roti . Second time also am going to have the same to see if it hits the spot again. I am gravitated towards Simone's authenticity. It spreads a kind of homey feeling which is rare nowadays. So far so good."}
{"text":"This is my go to for jerk chicken and the oxtail. I've taken friends from Jamaica and they love everything they've had: shrimp roti, veg roti, stewed chicken, fish plates etc etc. It can be slow to get your food when they're really busy so order some Johnny cakes or cod fritters as an app. Simones is worth the trip to the east end!"}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of eating there this afternoon . Quiet place. I was the only customer there for the first fifteen minutes. Clean and friendly staff. I was promptly approached and order taken. (I went alone). It did take quite a bit for food to served. Lol. That's ok. They had some pretty loud music to enjoy. I don't think though dancehall music is appropriate for restaurant dining.; however I ordered the large stew beef. I was thrown back when he asked me small or large. I would expect restaurant dining should come in one size. I did not like having to decide. Might be quite embarrassing if I was on date and took the large.lol. I had to state I was quite hungry. Lol.  The food was interesting; not the best I've had. ( I can make better). Lacked salt and too much browning. However the rice and peas were on point. Salad lacked salad ingredients. I expected tomatoes and cucumbers. I only received lettuce . Lol. The carrot cake was delicious. The hot sauce was terrible; it tasted more like food marinade. Overall quite expensive lunch. 30$ including parking. Will only return for cake. Just do a stop and grab. Just being brutally honest."}
{"text":"Damn!  I've had jerk chicken in Ocho Rios, Montego Bay, and various other parishes in Jamaica.  This is some of the best jerk chicken I've had outside of Jamaica.  The chicken is moist and the Johnny cakes were crispy & phenomenal.  Will becoming back here soon!"}
{"text":"Curry chicken roti is so soft and flavourful. Best one I've had so far within the city. 
I think the portions could be bigger but they're fine."}
{"text":"I still dream about Simone's jerk chicken roti. This food is absolutely incredible. If you haven't gone to Simone's then you're missing out. The potatoes inside the roti were so creamy. Chicken was hot but not overwhelming. 15/10 will be coming back."}
{"text":"Loved this place....we were visiting the city and for some reason wanted a little jerk....found this on Yelp and made the trip to give it a try.  My wife and I both had Roti's - one with chicken and one veggy - also a side of jerk chicken.  All was outstanding and the best part was Simone's hot sauce - great flavor and the only downside is she doesn't bottle it for sale."}
{"text":"Curry goat w/ rice and peas side of coleslaw and an order of plantains"}
{"text":"The food was amazing! I don't remember what I got--I think it was curried goat--but it was magnificent!! And the service was superb."}
{"text":"Wow!! Simone's is AMAZING!! Whether you grew up eating Jamaican food, or you're new to this cuisine, it is a must have!!!!! Everything that comes out of the kitchen is delicious and it's authentic and mouthwateringly good!!! It's also a rarity to find a Jamaican restaurant where you can sit down get served at a table and enjoy amazing food in a cute and cozy atmosphere. 
EVERYONE MUST TRY THE SOUP!!!!!!! Best soup I've ever had, no joke. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Most authentic Caribbean place I've visited in the city. The oxtail rivals mom's! Anyone looking for authentic West Indian food owes it to themselves to visit this place."}
{"text":"Very disappointing.  Baffles the mind that the food here would have 5*.  The food is very, very mediocre. That's both compared to actual places in Jamaica and Jamaican places in Toronto (North of Eglinton). 

I hate the Jerk chicken plate and my girlfriend had the Oxtail, because she loves Oxtail so much.  This Oxtail was one of the worst I've tried.  Greasy, sloppy, sinewy with slimy sauce.  Even the Oxtail at Island Foods on King West is better than this one, though my Caribbean friends expressed disdain for that one too.  

The jerk chicken was burned, tasteless and looked overall dirty.  The rice and beans that came with it were dry and lukewarm.  

The ambiance is clean as most Caribbean places in town are greasy holes in the wall.  This one is clean.

For the people giving 5* to this food: do yourself a favor and try Island Foods on King West, it is not the best in T.O but much better than this one. 

Two stars for cleanliness."}
{"text":"The young woman that seated us tonight does not belong in the restaurant / hospitality / customer service business. After dropping the menus on the table and saying \"Here\", she just turned and walked away. She had a very unpleasant demeanor.

Thankfully, we were served by somebody else. We had a craving for sweet potato pudding but they were sold out. The ice cream was good though."}
{"text":"The only word I can think of to sum this place would be \"comfortable\".  Warm, homey decor and smiley service were just additional perks to the great food I had. The curry that came with my chicken was flavorful with just the right amount of spice. The chicken itself was tender and perfectly cooked. My friend ordered the vegetarian roti, and we were both really pleased with how packed it was with different kinds of green vegetables. Flavors were bright and fresh. Also really enjoyed the individual pots of tea/coffee that they serve (coffee itself was delicious with almost an \"earthy\" character to it). Almost did a double-take when I looked at the bill, too."}
{"text":"Really tasty and well seasoned channa and vegetable roti and some of the best rice and peas I've had. Will definitely go back.

Note: Steps at front, not accessible."}
{"text":"Simone's is a great new option amongst the souvlaki joints on the Danforth. They serve fresh delicious food, and the price is right! Great service and a lot of choices on the menu. I had the chicken roti which was very good, and my friends had the jerk chicken and barbeque chicken with rice. The soup is also a great comfort food for the cold winter. Simone's is tout simplement délicieux! I will definitely be back here for lunch!"}
{"text":"I never expected to find a place like this in this part of the city, but I'm glad I did.

Prices are fantastic, food is superb.  The jerk chicken is the real winner here, but everything is delicious.

The beers are wonderful, all the treats are tasty.

Next time I find myself out this way I will definitely return."}
{"text":"The Jerk Chicken is really good, though I'm not sure I loved their oxtail.  It was good but I think it could have been cooked for longer as the tendon wasn't really falling off the bone.  We also tried their other sides and I liked the Johnny cakes and rice the best.  Coleslaw is also good.  Not too creamy!"}
{"text":"Awesome!!!   I loved the food and the staff... I have not been in Toronto since 2001 and I was really craving Oxtail and Roti   Simone's did not let me down.  Met up with friends and family and we had a wonderful time there.  The patio is really nice and calming.  I will definitely go back.  LOVED IT!!"}
{"text":"At Simone's for a second time. Had the Jerk Chicken this time. Delicious!!! And service really friendly once again. Give it a try. Totally worth it. :)"}
{"text":"Loved the food, Loved the people! 
Great service, you should have it with a red stripe! ;) brought some back in our Airbnb mini-fridge because the rice is so good but too much for me (yay, a second meal lol). However, my boyfriend had enough & was really please with everything too! :)"}
{"text":"My go to place for Caribbean food! Food is always amazing and fresh here! Oxtail is a fantastic choice. Also jerk chicken  And cant forget the beef patties!! Cant wait to eat here again soon!"}
{"text":"Simone's was pretty good. The food had some flavor and impact, but it lacked presentation and kick. 
We enjoyed the Johnny Cakes (interesting), along with the jerk chicken which had decent flavor but lacked a lot of meat. 
Would go back to try some of the other dishes. Service was a bit slow, but nothing terrible."}
{"text":"Quality West Indian food, & made the same every time. I love their consistency and the fact they take pride in the presentation of the food. I've tried a few dishes on their menu but I must say the oxtail & jerk chicken are my fav!"}
{"text":"This is the best Caribbean food I've tasted since I moved to Canada! 

I have always found myself enjoying the food and service here. I also love seeing the diverse type of customers who visit the restaurant (eat-in or take out).

I took my siblings who live overseas to Simone's and they both loved every part of their meal.

This place is ideal & worth every dollar if you are on a budget (like most of us).
 
I live by Jane & Sheppard and I would gladly travel all the way to Greektown to eat here!"}
{"text":"First time at Simone's.  I had the Johnny Cakes to start.  They came to the table hot and fresh.  The Red Bean soup was perfect for a cold windy day.  It was spicy, hearty and full of flavor.  

Finally, I had the small jerk chicken with potato salad.  First thing I noticed were the portions.  Very generous.  Then the flavor... Wow, it was the best jerk chicken I have ever eaten.  Simone's has now taken my top spot as best Jerk Chicken in Toronto.  

I don't live close by, but I will make it a point to go back and try some more of their dishes."}
{"text":"First time hearing about this spot, so my friends and I decided to check it out today while at the Taste of Danforth. We weren't feeling Greek today and any day is a good day for Jamaican. Decided to keep it simple and got the classic Large Jerk Chicken dinner (half chicken), can't go wrong with that and it's hard to mess up. The meal was bigger than I expected, but for that price ($12) it better have been. Rice and peas were great, cole slaw was really good although the portion size was quite small compared to other places I've visited. The chicken was delicious and juicy and the jerk seasoning was also great. One thing I did not expect was the intense spiciness of it. I wasn't really warned and was expecting s typical mild/spice to it, however I was sweating buckets eating it. I can't handle that much heat to begin with, so it might've been better for most others. Sriracha is usually what I stick to in terms of hot sauce, I didn't get a chance to ask but whatever they used was intense! No complaints though. One of the employees there was laughing at me every time she walked by, seeing how sweaty I was from the meal. Definitely recommend this spot to guests."}
{"text":"Simone's really spices things up by being one of the few Caribbean restaurants in the GTA where you can sit and enjoy a flavourful meal with plates, cutlery and all. Greektown isn't short on variety and this place is no exception. Whether you are staying or taking your food away, ordering here is nothing short of a classic experience, complete with furniture and decor that looks transported straight from a tiny island resort.

Must-try items:
Jerk chicken
Curry Goat
Cole slaw/Rice and peas

I'd been trying to check this place out for a while and finally made it in the late evening. You don't find many restaurants open until 11:00pm on a weekday, far less for ones that serve roti or festivals. Everything about this place is as laid back as you'd expect, in a good way. Jerk chicken was a no-brainer, and it doesn't disappoint at all. The curry goat is some of the most tender, well-seasoned meat I've sampled before. Simone definitely cooks with love and authenticity. 'Aunties home cooking' comes to mind, right down to the presentation.

Meat dishes seem to be their specialty, so I plan to try everything else on the menu. There is a patio in both the front and back of the restaurant, which expands choices for customers. My only issue was that all the windows and doors were open, leading to a bit of a nuisance with some unwanted flying guests. It would be nice if they could do something about that. Aside from that, this is a place you'll enjoy and want to come back to."}
{"text":"Family-owned spot with friendly service and reasonably-priced food. What's not to love? 

I got the curry goat roti with a side of plantains. All meals come with either a side of coleslaw or salad. I was actually a big fan of their coleslaw, I wish they had put more in the side serving. Plantains were bomb! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Ordered the jerk chicken, curry chicken, and chicken roti with a side of potato salad. All the chicken was tender and moist, the spicing was wonderfully balanced and had a nice, soft heat to it. The potato salad was also really, really good, and I'm pretty picky when it comes to good potato salad. The rice was a bit dry, and it could have definitely used extra gravy/sauce. We ended up with leftover rice.The roti had great flavour. it seemed very filling centred, the wrap hardly holding it together. It was also potato heavy - not a great amount of chicken. but it was our favourite dish regardless. 

We ordered for pickup, it was ready quickly, the lady working was nice and remembered my name from the order. The decor is simple but cute, will probably have lunch here sometime. Altogether I paid $35 and it served as dinner for 3 and lunch for 3, so that's like $6 a meal which is not a bad deal at all. Do check them out the next time you want some Jamaican!"}
{"text":"Friendly attentive staff and a relaxing caribbean vibe. Best places to sit is at the back  patio. Wow you will forget you are on the danforth. 
Now about the food, I love eating oxtail aka beef on the bone, jerk chicken or the roti  literally once a week. Not to sound cliché but Simone's food is finger-licking-good."}
{"text":"A friend of mine, who is born Canadian, introduced me to this Caribbean restaurant around early Fall of 2014. I am originally from Jamaica, and I can honestly say the Jamaican food at Simone's Caribbean Restaurant is THE BEST I have tasted so far in Canada since migrating to this country over four years ago.
The food is absolutely fantastic and I have since taken other friends there who agree.

The oxtail, chicken, and ackee & saltfish are among my favorites.

The service can be tightened up a bit sometimes. A few times I've gone there and it took a while  for someone to appear to offer the welcome or to provide the cheque after the meal, even when the restaurant wasn't busy. 
The waitresses are usually quite pleasant, but the level of enthusiasm of service varies depending who's working when you visit."}
{"text":"Simone's probably has THE best roti that I've tried in Toronto! The staff is super friendly too!"}
{"text":"Food: I had the vegetarian chickpea and callaloo roti - great and very flavourful though a bit rich / buttery. The side salad was a nice complement but relatively simple. Portions were very large so I only ate about half - good value overall. My boyfriend had the jerk chicken which he thoroughly enjoyed. 

Service was very friendly and prompt. Seems like a very well run family joint with a great neighbourhood feel.

We'll be back if we're in the area again!"}
{"text":"Came here with my sisters last night and got a bunch of stuff.

Cod cake, Johnny cake, beef patty, oxtail with rice, bbq chicken with rice and chicken roti.

Like is said..... we ordered alot lol

The chicken is really soft when they cook it. Love the roti and the food pretty much is great. 

The Johnny cake is alright. Just not a fan of deep fried bread.

The ppl are really nice too.  If you want a carribean fix then this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Great food! Went last night with my boyfriend and ordered the fried plantains and johnny cakes to start. Cakes were ok but plantain was delicious! 

I had the small Ackee & Salt Fish which was incredible and even took about half of it home the portion was so huge! Just the right amount of spice as well. Boyfriend had the large BBQ chicken which was an enormous amount of delicious food. BBQ sauce was sweet rather than spicy but was incredibly flavourful. 

We both also ordered the Coleslaw which was nice and enjoed some Red Stripe with our meals."}
{"text":"Service a little on the slow side but food was pretty good.  Two apps, three dinners, two beers and a pop under $90 with tip.  Sat on the patio which was nice.  Servers need to smile more cause if I feel welcome I'm more likely to come back."}
{"text":"Very good Caribbean food and the quantity of food is huge! I surely enjoyed that jerk chicken and fried plantain"}
{"text":"Excellent roti. Very tasty and large had for lunch and did not need dinner. Will definitely return. Best Carribean I have had in a long time. Service was great as well."}
