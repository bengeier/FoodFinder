{"text":"Very friendly, family owned, good food, fast service, spotlessly clean -- and inexpensive."}
{"text":"The best and only Chinese  restaurant in Cross Plains.... Used to frequent this place when I worked in town. Food was always prepared fresh, the restaurant was always spotless. The fortune cookies never had relatable fortunes, all in all a good Chinese place for the money, (it's inexpensive)"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what why there are so many positive reviews at this place other than it adds some variety to then otherwise bland Cross Plains dining scene.  I was there with a friend and everything was very salty and overly sweet. We dined in and this really seemed to confuse the people working who I'm guessing were the owners. There was a very attentive little girl working the counter. Based on the other reviews I might give this place a 2nd shot."}
{"text":"Servicable Chinese food in Cross Plains.  The food is hot, fresh and tasty.  I wouldn't make a special trip to Cross Plains JUST for this food, but if you live in town, or are passing through, it does the trick.  Good portions."}
