{"text":"What an amazing place!  This is the place my brother, Tim, ate for years.  He always raved about the food and the incredible service - and he can be very picky about both so that's saying something!   After his death, Megan's actually sent a gorgeous bouquet of flowers to the funeral home 2 hrs from Bedford.  There was nothing in it for them--just good, old-fashioned caring well for other people!   While I have not YET eaten at Megans (I live 2 hrs away), my husband & I plan to visit this incredible place.  I hope you do too!  If you're picky like my brother, you will walk away with your belly full & a smile on your face!"}
{"text":"Mmm yummay stop for breakfast. Classic greasy spoon diner. Which is not a bad thing. There cornbeef hash is to die for. Real corn beef not from a can."}
{"text":"This place is great. My significant other and I just moved into the neighborhood last year and this is definitely our favorite breakfast spot. They do take out, and it's ready quickly. Staff is very welcoming and are the epitome of \"family restaurant\". I would give it 4.5 stars if possible, only because while their omelets taste good, they're pretty thin, not fluffy. Still, super great."}
{"text":"Love this place! My grandparents took me there as a small girl and I still return to this day with my son. Staff is friendly and food is amazing. And cheap"}
{"text":"Was a good place to sit down and eat....staff was very friendly and kept out coffee cups full and our bellies lol"}
{"text":"Great little spot for all day breakfast and more. Friendly and accommodating staff when asking for changes and extras."}
{"text":"Just a lil mom & pop diner on Broadway, just past downtown Bedford. Usually just come for breakfast- for a few bucks you get a good meal and leave feeling full"}
{"text":"Good menu with lots of American classics at very good prices.  They allowed me to substitute a veggie patty out for a special burger with a small surcharge of $2.  Nice waitress, too!  Looks like a local place but they welcomed us in."}
{"text":"Fantastic service and food was amazing.  Bedford's best kept secret!  Small and cozy atmosphere.  Try it, you'll like it."}
{"text":"This is such a cozy little place to sit and eat!  Prices are cheap too!  My roommate and I stopped by here one morning when their corned beef special was listed in the window and we are glad we did!  First off, this old diner styled restaurant nestled in the corner of a small business strip where there are closed shops/businesses and a convenient store so it is very easy to overlook the yellow sign for Megan's but should not be missed for a decent, cheap meal!  You can sit  at the counter or at tables and booths.  We chose a booth that was close to the front.  Comfortable with room to spare at the table.  Coffee was good, food was excellent for the price and the service was quick too with the fact there were a dozen other people there before us.  Our total bill, with coffee and appetizer was less than $30 too!  Overall, this was a pleasant place to sit and eat.  I look forward to eating here again and seeing what their next special will be."}
{"text":"The food was very good. First going there since the new owners took over. I ordered the Meat Omelette and although it was good to lacked cheese. The servers were very friendly and attentive. That goes a long way for a small place like this."}
{"text":"My wife alway enjoy going there for breakfast great food good value staff very friendly..... but things changed to much with new owners food not as good ,decor reminds me of my great great great grandmas, staff pushy and not knowledgeable about menu. Will not return"}
{"text":"Came for Mothers Day because all the other places were to crowded. I took a chance and was glad I did. French Toast, sausage links, bacon and home fries were all great. Server was excellent! Prices are decent."}
