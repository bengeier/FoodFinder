{"text":"Wow.. What an amazing deal for happy hour! You get great deals on Martini's and Burgers at a fine dining Steakhouse!! If you haven't tried it.. You must!!!"}
{"text":"Can't stand the smell! Come to Flemings all the time. They were remodeling and something isn't right! Smells like sewer literally. I think they have a plumbing issue from the remodel."}
{"text":"This place is entirely too la-de-dah for me.  Of course the steak is good! At upwards of $45 a pop, it had BETTER be!  Then throw in the fact that you have to shell out $9 for a chunk of iceberg lettuce, or anything else you might want on your plate besides meat--not to mention beverages--and the bill really packs wallop.  At prices like this, the meal should blow my hair back and give me a back rub.  Not a fan."}
{"text":"Excellent service! Fabulous food! Fleming's serves the best baked potato ever.  I adore the French Onion Soup. Don't miss the Carrot Cake!  Restaurant, like most steakhouses, is a tad noisy. I've dined here many times and they seem to keep the temperature a bit cool so I bundle up in wintertime."}
{"text":"Been there several times and they serve the best steak I've had in Madison.  A good place to have a conversation or a special night.    You do have to like their ambiance. For my wife and I though it was too pretentious.  Too artificial.  Too stiff.  Too self aware.  They need to pull it back and relax just a bit.  This is Madison.  But again, the food, though pricey is outstanding."}
{"text":"I recently had the pleasure of going out for a burger with a fellow food blogger who turned me onto several great new locations for burgers and some other good food in town. He suggested we meet up at an off-the-strip location that wasn't anywhere on my radar, and although he's a much more established writer than yours truly, I really wasn't sure if I could trust his judgment as I've been steered in the wrong path quite often in this town. The restaurant was Fleming's Prime Steakhouse and Wine Bar, and luckily so far his recommendations are 1 for 1.  Fleming's is located in Summerlin amidst quite a number of stuffy people and restaurants. When I pulled up to the restaurant I noticed that they offered valet, but since I typically hate valeting my car I thought I'd try some of my parking karma. After a long drive around most of the parking lot in the back, I caved and pulled back in front to valet my car. After being through this, I would suggest using their valet service if you ever go; they park right in front of the place and have your car there in seconds.  The burger in question is only served at their bar and not in the main restaurant, and to top it off the burger is half price during happy hour. More on that in a bit. We chose to meet on a Friday night at 6, if you're going to do this prepare for a bit of a crowd. We ended up running into a couple friends I knew so we were able to kind of sneak an extra seat into the bar and sit pretty quickly, but don't necessarily count on this as there were many people hovering until around 8. The bar itself has maybe a dozen or so seats, plus several high top tables of 4 seats each. They offer a couple choices for the burger, but per my recommendation I went with the Fleming's Prime Burger which comes with cheddar and peppered bacon. And based on some inside info, I was told that the meat is basically the trimmings of their steaks and prime meats that they offer, so this promised to be quite a burger. And it was. The meat had really great flavor, and was cooked perfectly to medium-rare as ordered. It was juicy all the way through, but not too messy. The cheddar was melted thoroughly, and the challah-like bun was soft and delicious. The peppered bacon was mostly crispy, maybe a tiny bit undercooked in a couple spots, but also had really great flavor.  The fries were also a pleasant surprise; after having a series of disappointing French fry experiences lately these were quite good. Maybe some a little undercooked, but really great natural cut fries with good flavor. If I were to have any complaint about them at all it would be that there weren't quite enough, I almost had to watch my intake to make sure I had a bite of French fry to accompany every bite of my burger until the end.  All of this leads up to what is a fantastic price; regularly this is a $12 offering which I think is more than reasonable for what you get, and a total steal when you compare it to other burgers of the same price point like Smashburger, Five Guys or even some more expensive ones on the strip. If you still have any doubt about a $12 burger, the half price option at happy hour should seal the deal. The closest thing you can get to that price is Henry's or In-N-Out, and neither of those is quite comparable even though I'm still a huge fan of the old In-N-Out. So even if you can't make it in for the happy hour price I say this is more than worth it, but for $6 I compel you to find better."}
{"text":"Thought it was ok! Food was ok, not great. Service was slow and I felt like we were there forever. The waiter explained a dish to me and when it arrived, not what I thought. I never ask for A1 at steak houses because it is rude, but this steak needed it. Most likely never go there again."}
{"text":"OMG WHAT A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE!! My husband and I were celebrating our five year anniversary.  We heard nice things about Fleming's and thought we'd give it a try.  We had a 7:00 reservation and arrived a few minutes early so after we checked in we went to the bar for a cocktail.  My husband ordered a martini, and I was looking over the wine list.  I wanted a pinot, and asked the server what her thoughts were.   She shared her thoughts and said if I wanted I could taste a few different Pinot's.  I thought she was suggesting I could order a flight so I did.  I asked to try three different Pinot's.  She poured all three and brought them for me to try side by side.  Yummy and very fun.  In the mean time, the hostess came by and told us   \"there is no hurry at all, but I want to let you know when ever you're ready, your table is available\".  Wonderful...So after tasting each of the pours I ordered my favorite and the hostess seated us. (so nice not to be rushed:)  When we paid the tab for our drinks, the bar tender only charged us for the martini and a glass of wine( not the flight)  very nice! Once seated, our waitress was just as attentive and knowledgeable and the food was spectacular!!  We had brought a bottle of wine to have with dinner.  They decanted the wine for us and did not charge us a corkage fee.  After dinner they brought us an assortment of chocolate truffles and again wished us a Happy Anniversary. I'm so happy we celebrated our five year anniversary with Fleming's...it was a wonderful experience!!!"}
{"text":"I do not know how they could have done any better.  Our foursome went on a Sunday night.  It might have been a little slow for them, but they didn't let that disappoint them.  Made reservations through Yelp for 7:30.  Very slick.  We arrived about 7:00 and they said they would try to accommodate us a bit early.  We said, \"No problem\" and headed for the bar.  Bar service was very good.  They do this first pour of wine into a mini carafe then pour that into a wine glass.  I think this is because their wine glasses are so large it would look like you were being shorted.  This way seemed like extra work but I understand why.  Waitress was outstanding.  She anticipated our needs and timed her appearances very well.  We all had the Sunday night prime rib special.  Felt like this was an outstanding deal which included the prime rib, choice of salad, choice of side and choice of dessert.  I had the Fleming salad and grilled asparagus and the carrot cake for my choices.  My wife had the Fleming salad, Fleming potatoes (sort of an au gratin potato kicked up) and the lava cake.  We shared liberally.  Not a sour note to be found.  Service was top notch.  We would not hesitate to go back."}
{"text":"Whats not to love, I visit Flemings often usually on a Friday or Saturday evening with the wife and the service is always impeccable as is the food."}
{"text":"While the food has been ok on previous visits, cancelling a private room reservation with 3 days notice for my grandparents 60th anniversary is not. I understand the preference for a larger group in the space, but provide an adequate solution. This customer service is seriously lacking. Going somewhere else."}
{"text":"Met some friends here for happy hour and I was really impressed with the quality of the food and the service. We ordered all the happy hour appetizers and enjoyed every one of them."}
{"text":"First time ,I visit flemins prime steak house food was good but service not, ok here we go I sat down at the bar for almost 15 minutes she did not offer a drink or a least a menu she was busy ,which I understand then I moved to one of the tables next to the bar,and othere 5 minutes ok server finally arrived to my table at the point I knew what I want ,,I got dry age ribeye I think was 65 or 55  anyways ,she took the order from there I never saw her againg ,one the bussers or server came by he say would you like some water I say yes please ,he never came back o couple minutes after I asked for some breat to diferent person guess what I never get it  ,anyways my food arrived to the table steak was way over cook I wanted medium rare it was almost well done ,,"}
{"text":"Happy Hour is until 7pm and it is a great value for good food and wine. The bar is not big enough for socializing, but if you're looking for quality food at a good price in a more upscale environment, this is the place."}
{"text":"The dinner had very good parts, some okay parts and some bad parts. We ordered two appetizers, the crispy pork bellies and the baked Brie. The crispy pork bellies had a great flavor and were very enjoyable. The baked Brie was just okay. The French onion soup was well done with an excellent flavor. The salads were average. The meat entrees were average to poor.  All were cooked to the proper temperature but for prime meat lacked flavor. The prime rib was very dry. The desserts were all good.   The service was also a bit mixed. Our table was not ready at the time of our reservation and the lobby area is very limited. Upon being seated it took a long time to get our initial drinks (approx 10 minutes) for water. The service than greatly improved and became attentive though one side dish was forgotten and  at the end of the night it was noticed that the check had extra dessert on the bill. I would recommend several other steak houses above this place."}
{"text":"We've been to Flemings in Madison twice, once when it first opened, and again this past weekend.  The first time we decided we wouldn't go back:  It was so noisy you couldn't carry on a conversation, a sporting event on the tv was on in the bar area, and the music was awful.  To be honest, I don't even remember if the food was any good or not that evening.    This weekend we went with another couple because we'd been given Flemings gift cards for our birthdays.  They offered a prime rib special that made dining there almost affordable.  The service was good, although the last thing I need after a day staring at a computer screen is an iPad on the table (the wine list is on an iPad).  The food, however, was mostly pretty poor.  The wedge salad was fine, but the prime rib was tough and flavorless.  The mushroom side was good.  I ordered carrot cake for dessert, I like carrot cake very much; it came with about two parts frosting for one part cake.  I scraped a half-inch of frosting off the top and found the small amount of cake beneath, but it could only be described as \"wet\", also without flavor.  Considering the regular prices in the menu, it's astonishing they're still in business.  The atmosphere is more like a fancy sports bar putting on the ritz than a fine restaurant, even though their prices are certainly 'fine restaurant' prices.  Flemings management apparently has confused pretentiousness with true class.  We will request no gift cards in the future!"}
{"text":"Decided to try Flemings as I was hungry for a sizzling steak and an earthy glass of wine.  What a disappointment.  Wine pour was short.  Salad was plain and simple.  And, my steak was overdone yet mushy.  I'm a foody and expect the best.  I'll be passing on Flemings in the future.  T-BONES is MUCH better in every way."}
{"text":"Our reservation on TG was for 7:30. They closed at 8:00. We were seated in a booth right before 8:00. The seat had food/crumbs. We ordered the crab cakes as an appetizer. They were out. I ordered the wedge. It was drowned in dressing and served with very over ripe (read indelible) tomatoes.The bread plates were 'crusty' (read not entirely clean). Bread was never offered. We ordered a large bottle of sparkling water. We were presented with two small bottles, as the large bottle was unavailable. The tumblers were also 'crusty' (again, not entirely clean). I ordered a petite filet with Bernaise sauce. I did not get Bernaise sauce. I was given a very vinegary tasting BBQ sauce. I didn't bother to point it out, as our server Aaron seemed intent on passing that off as something other than BBQ sauce and probably thought we didn't know the difference.  We ordered creme brûlée for dessert. I asked for an espresso. Aaron comes back and tells us espresso/cappuccino machine is down for the night. I was done. Forget dessert. Just please bring the check. If you are open until 8:00 but seat as late as 7:30, everything should be available until that last top is presented a check! Guests should not be aware of kitchen staff loudly shutting down as they are eating. Regarding the crusty dishes, a server must wash their hands often and take a good look at what they are putting before guests. We left feeling slightly disgusted and underwhelmed. For those top shelf prices we should've left feeling like we had gotten top shelf service."}
{"text":"Amazing steak!!  My bestfriends and I came here tonight for my friends birthday dinner. The servers were very nice and accomidating to our 3 way split check, which I know is annoying.   I had the peppercorn steak which was to die for!! The chipotle macaroni was amazing!!   Highly recommended for a good steak dinner!"}
{"text":"Pretty bad experience.   Arrived at our reservation time and got seated promptly.  That's when it started to go downhill.  No one came to our table for quite a few minutes.    Server makes it over to the table and takes our drink order and then she's gone for a good while.  No one comes to the table with bread or water.  Drinks finally come and we place our order.    Cajun shrimp appetizer, peppercorn strip steak for him, filet for her, creamed spinach to share.  Shrimp comes out.  It's nothing special. Average sized shrimp a little over cooked.  Still no bread.    Finally ask the bus person for bread.  A few minutes later the bread comes out. It had been in the oven too long and was crunchy on the outside. Not very tasty.  Entrees come out next.  Creamed spinach and the steaks, one of which they forgot to cook.  I kid you not, it was nearly raw.  Both steaks are served on a white plate with not so much as a piece of parsley on the plate. Terrible presentation.  The strip steak is a little undercooked and virtually devoid of any seasoning. It's supposed to be the peppercorn crusted version.  Someone forgot that part.   We sent the steak back and said forget that and split the steak.  The creamed spinach was OK, but nothing out of the ordinary.   Overall, pretty awful night out.  This place is pricy with everything a la carte.  The steaks were mediocre at best.  Not somewhere I'd go back to in the future. Can't figure out how you run a steak house and can't cook a steak with proper seasoning or temperature.  Pretty disappointing experience"}
{"text":"Went here with high hopes...left disappointed. Service was fine but food marginal and drinks super weak. Filet mignon was descent. Granted they are not a fish joint, their mahi way over salted and ahi over peppered.  For $400, not worth it..."}
{"text":"Wonderful Prime Rib on Sunday nights. Girlfriend took me here for my birthday, thanks babe! We enjoyed a few cheap drinks at the bar during happy hour (anytime before 7pm) and delicious appetizers of tenderloin carpaccio and the cajun shrimp. Then we sat for a top notch dinner, which was accompanied by attentive and prompt service. I could find no faults (not that I was looking for them) throughout the entire dining service. They even asked my girlfriend if she wanted a black napkin instead of a white one because of her dress. Classy! 4.5/5 stars really. (when will yelp add half ratings??)  I must mention, there was some not so classy people sitting next to us, dipping a $50 dollar steak in Ketchup sauce. omg... Please people, order medium rare always and only au jus...."}

{"text":"Flemings delivers the consistent quality and service that you should expect from a high end steak chain. The food was fantastic and our server possessed that rare ability to always be available when she was needed, but never be intrusive. If given the choice to spend 200+ on a date night, I might go with a Tornado Steak House, but Flemings is an awesome Madison West option, and you can always rest assured that your experience is guaranteed by an upstanding chain restaurant organization."}
{"text":"After reading all the positive reviews I had positive expectations that were disappointingly not met.  The service was atrocious.  I had ordered the rib eye medium.  After forgetting my order, the restaurant proceeded to serve my steak rare.  When they tried to remediate this error, they proceeded to pan fry my rare steak which gave it a medium interior with a well done exterior.  The service ceased at this point with the waitress and she did not even approach the table  for the duration of the evening."}
{"text":"my boyfriend and i went to flemmings on valentines day (i know, the review is late but i just created this account and they are long over due a compliment) and though they were INSANELY busy and our reservations were pushed back an hour, they did an amazing job of keeping us happy. which was very difficult because our seven month old son was acting up and cranky and crying and everything you dont want a child to do at a restaurant. we almost left he was acting so horribly! but we didnt, and when we got to our table, our server (who's name i regrettably cannot remember) was smart enough to speak quietly so that our son wouldnt wake up. he let us know that we would have a complimentary appetizer because of our wait, which made me very happy because i got to have some delicious crab cakes which incidentally he recommended.   he was prompt, and kind, and though he worked at a fancy restaurant where it seems personality is frowned upon, was quiet personable and made us feel like we were guests at his home, more than customers in his section. great job flemmings! if i could eat there everyday i would!!!"}
{"text":"Sliced Filet Mignon is their best small plate dish! Glad it's back.  Flemings potatoes is good especially paired with steak, but nothing to write home about. Steaks are what is best here as expected: great quality and perfectly cooked to order. Wonderful wine selection, they have everything you need. Fantastic service too. Great place to go for a special occasion. I will be going back soon!"}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday. The decor is nice, clean and friendly staff. What you'd expect from a quality steakhouse. Seating is good, I don't like a place where tables are packed and you bump into fellow diners as you are getting into or out of your seat.   I had the Taste of Summer three course meal. It was very good and for the cost, I highly recommend giving it a try.   Kinda pricey and the portions are small. As I browsed the menu I kept flinching at the cost of some of the steaks and side dishes. Great flavor and a great dining experience. Not too fancy business casual and somewhat formal.   Overall I was impressed with the service staff. Extremely detailed and excellent customer service. Super friendly and helpful. Our server went above and beyond to make our dining experience wonderful.  It's on the expensive side. For me and my girlfriend, no cocktails or wine,  we shared an appitizer and dessert the bill was 150 with the tip."}
{"text":"Second experience was much better. The key is to go anytime besides restaurant week. The filet was perfect and the sides were delicious. Try the ahi tuna appetizer and the lava cake for dessert."}
{"text":"Didn't think much of this place they killed my steak and the manager avoided our table after complaining - won't be back"}
{"text":"I absolute love love this place. I go there every chance I get, anniversaries, birthdays etc.  The staff is always friendly and knowledgeable. I food is superb, I love New York Steak and they do it well every time. I don't even need to add sauces to make it taste good. The lava cake is great and well balance, is not too rich."}
{"text":"Have you ever ate something and compared it to something else that was slightly better. Or while you're eating it was missing that 1 thing that could make the overall meal perfect. Ok so my co workers and I went here for a business dinner. I ordered the rib eye (Bone in) Oscar Style. By the way this is one of my favorite dishes when I visit other Steak House restaurants. Well to keep it short, the flavor was excellent however my piece had a lot of fat. The Potatoes are great, the service was ok. Overall I gave this place 3 stars because in addition to my description above, it was overpriced."}
{"text":"Very good steak - nicely seasoned ribeye and cooked perfectly medium rare.    The service was interesting.  As mentioned in a previous review, they try hard.  But there is something just not right - the service felt too coached.  It was if the waiter was just regurgitating perfectly scripted lines.  However I felt like he really didn't care.    Very swanky decor - especially for Madison.  Prices were high - glad I was not paying!  My 4 star rating is based solely on the quality of my steak."}
{"text":"My experience at this restaurant was outstanding!!! Ryan was informative on the wine list. The food & service was phenomenal we will be coming back soon!!"}
{"text":"Avoid this place unless you enjoy being overcharged for mediocre, inconsistent food. Steak was fair (mine was fine, hers was tough and overdone), but the shrimp were badly overcooked and rubbery with a slop of mayonnaise-heavy filling and the careless addition of bacon. It was like they just threw some bacon on there because hey, everybody loves bacon. Yeah, not that much. The dessert was terrible. (Really -- you can mess up dessert.) The red velvet cake was...not much like cake at all. It was a sticky, oversweet (and oversized) brick that I could barely cut with a fork. That's not an exaggeration, we literally struggled to cut through the cake (it was served as a doubled portion for two). Sides were very good, but not near enough to compensate for the other shortfalls, especially at the prices they charge. Service was fine (good waiter) but the maitre d' practically walked away before we could return his greeting. You'll do a lot better elsewhere. I could tell you where, but Yelp CENSORED my recommendation. Look in Middleton."}
{"text":"OK, I've been to Fleming's many times and each time something is amiss. This time it was the ever present fruit flies. What the \"F\"!!  When I'm eating my $48 chef special rib eye I don't want insects bothering me.  There were 7 of us in our party, on January 2. The place was D-E-A-D. So why were we there 3 hours?? because the service was S-L-O-W.   As I stated above, I ordered the rib eye, medium rare. How did it arrive? Medium. For $48 I want my steak prepared how I order it. I sent it back. As usual, when you send back your meal, you will be the last one eating, which I was. I hate that! The second steak was cooked perfectly, and very good.  And, the manager came out, apologized,  comped the steak, and tried to ply me with drinks. Very nice.   I had a caesar salad, which was good. The Fleming's potatoes were very good, as usual. I was disappointed about their lack of Italian red wines. One good choice for $90/bottle, one crappy choice for $30. I stuck to my vodka and tonics. The fresh berries for dessert were a disappointment. They mostly consisted of unripe strawberries. OK, OK, what was I thinking??? fresh berries in Wisconsin on January 2? Idiot. My companions enjoyed the lava cake.   I'll go back again, when someone else is paying."}
{"text":"Had reservations, wch were sorely needed this busy night. Who'd have guessed vegas is in a recession with a packed parking lot, overflow seating waiting for tables in the lobby spilled onto the entrance outside. fortunately, we were seated immediately. i chose the filet mignon trio pre fixe $50. my dining partner opted for the bone in ribeye with a caesar salad. my dining experience began with a caprese salad, with thick slices of mozzarella and heirloom tomatoes, almost but not quite as good as the same served at speidini (one of my faves), main course was a trio of petit filets with 3 different sauces, wellington, oscar and au poivre. i loved the bearnaise sauce served in a well beneath the medium rare cooked meat. that was my favorite. yummy!  could only take a bite of each, so filling. not in the mood for wine, so had one martini with bluecheese stuffed olives to start out the night.  my date didn't eat much but said his food was delicious. so i guess i ate for two that night. dessert was a trio of differently prepared creme brulees, but by that time i was stuffed so as a joke, i asked the waiter how he could possibly get my baked goodness to go.  lo and behold, he came back moments later with little to-go ramekins complete with my desserts intact. all in all, date was a little ?yawn sigh? But, truthfully, the food was very filling. and i had loads of creme brulee to satisfy my sweet tooth the next day. and the day after."}
{"text":"Happy hour. not busy. Not dead. nice but forgetful, slow service.  Food good. probably will not return soon.  not a must-go-to return destination.  Valet service seems ridiculous--parking is RIGHT THERE."}
{"text":"Like others have said, keep in mind its a chain.   I had a great experience at the Flemings in Oklahoma City that I was dying to try out Flemings in Madison.  However, I was somewhat disappointed.  I had the fillet with garlic mashed potatoes and my steak was cooked too much and the mashed potatoes were too garlicky.  I also felt I was being isolated since I was having dinner by myself.  I'd rather go to Ruth's Chris over this location."}
{"text":"Came here on a VERY busy night, looked like a social hour/wine tasting event or something. Despite the chaos out service was good. l had the pork chops which were DELICIOUS, and l normally don't even like chops l just didn't want a steak. Wedge salad was good and the mushroom ravioli was excellent. Will be back, only annoying thing was the noise level but like l said we went on a VERY busy night"}
{"text":"This place is really nice. I try not to support large corporate businesses such as this, but it's hard to find a mom and pop steak house. The wife took me here for my birthday and I have to say, the food was excellent. The service impeccable.  Very friendly and professional staff. Even got a free chocolate lava cake for dessert!  Outstanding!"}
{"text":"Last Sunday was my second time at Flemings.. And again I was very very disappointed.. The first time I was there I had the bone-in ribeye and it was really good, but the service was terrible. My second time was worse. My girlfriend and I ordered the prime rib.. It had no taste!!! 4 queens prime rib was A LOT better. The service was very slow. It took 30 mins just to get the appetizer!! I already lost my appetite by the time it got there. I had 2 loaves of bread with my gf because we had to wait so long.. It took another 30-40 mins to get my prime rib.. I wouldn't have been so upset if the prime rib tasted better, but the bread had more taste!! The Mac n cheese was ok.. Rm sushi's Mac n cheese is soo much better. The cheesecake was decent. It tasted like the jack in the box cheesecake.. I probably won't go back to Flemings. The bill came out to 120... And we still left a $20 tip..if we ever decide to go back, hopefully they'll have better service ."}
{"text":"We went to Fleming's on a Saturday at 7 for our anniversary. It was a really lovely experience, though quite expensive. Parking was easy, and there were still plenty of empty tables. We were greeted and seated immediately.   They offered the regular menu and a two-course prixe fixe. My husband had steak and salmon. He likes his steak quite rare, and it came as he requested. I had scallops, which were done perfectly, and we shared the chocolate lava cake. The cake was quite good, but I've had it done better.   My husband doesn't drink, so I had wine by the glass. I like that they offer an iPad app listing wines and their descriptions, along with suggestions for menu pairings. The suggestion was spot on for my choices, and though the selection wasn't huge there was a broad selection of choices. The prices are similar to those you see in larger cities, though.   Our server, Mat, was excellent. I don't know that I've had that quality of service in the Madison area before - cheerful, professional, not overbearing, perfectly timed. He pointed out that the scallops have \"a bit of a kick\" to them, even though this is not mentioned in the description at all. Thank goodness, because spicy food sends me straight into a migraine. He made sure the kitchen left the spice out, and I was able to enjoy my night. At the end of our meal, we were presented with a box of truffles in honor of our anniversary, as well as a gift card to use for our next meal! Mat and these little extra touches are what prompted me to come on here and give a review - that sort of thing needs to be rewarded.  About the expense - I think the food and presentation were very good. My only issue is that with places like L'Etoile in town, the menu could have been more inventive for the price, and for that reason I did not give it five stars. I know it's a steakhouse, but the food just didn't make me dream about it like I do some other places. I would recommend this place highly for a business dinner, or place to bring the less adventurous family members, and when you want your meal to be handled with New York City - level professional staff (only friendlier!). I feel like I'm damning with faint praise, and I don't mean to do that at all. It was very, very good, just not sell-a-kidney-to-eat-there good."}
{"text":"It's always a little odd reviewing chain restaurants on Yelp, but I have to say something good at about this place; it is an excellent steakhouse.  I came here with my family over the holidays, and we all left praising the meal.  I have nothing but excellent things to say about the food, service, and overall experience.  In particular, I really enjoyed how our waitress was extremely honest in giving her advice on the various menu options; it's a nice break from kiss ass \"oh, you'll love it\" type responses about every item."}
{"text":"Clean air and great food!! The service is good/ not great. Mushroom ravioli is the best small plate ... They need to fix the beer tap/ Stella came out flat as a pancake but the server replaced it. I like when the server announces \"last call for happy hour \" especially if they know that's what you came for (did not happen) carpaccio was medics but the Burrata was great. I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good.  Went for a company dinner and I thought - Oh, great, going to a chain.  Very nice appetizers - calamari with sweet Thai pepper sauce, crab cakes, seared ahi, carpaccio. The grilled salmon was good, others said beef medallion and chicken dishes were cooked well and tasty.  Creme brulee good but not special."}
{"text":"To start,  we had the Lobster Tempura.  It was decadent.  The jam gave it such a nice balance to the crispy tempura texture.  It was kind of like eating waffles with some fruit jam.  It was salty, sweet and crunchy.  For $20, it's worth it to try it at least once.    For the main course,  I had the chef's special tonight, a petite fillet Mignon with pan seared scallops and grilled asparagus.  The fillet Mignon pan seared and topped with goat cheese.  The fillet was cooked perfectly and it was so tender.  I didn't feel that the goat cheese matched very well with the fillet.  However, my scallops were perfect.  It was cooked perfectly and I can taste the subtle hint of sweetness from the scallops.  Completely yummie.  My hubby had the rib eye steak and he totally inhaled it.  I had one bite and it was delicious.    For the sides, we had the Fleming's potatoes.  These were very good.  They're scallop potatoes.  These creamy cheesy potatoes were the best scallop potatoes I've ever had.  Also, we ordered the green beans with mushrooms.  They tasted okay.  It was nothing special and I probably wouldn't order this side again.  The next time I go and there will certainly be a next time, I want the cream of spinach.  I've heard so much about them.  Overall, the meal was excellent.  The total was about $130 without drinks.  -M2"}
{"text":"5 Stars for the food and customer service.    We came on a Sunday so I had their Prime Rib Special which included the Prime rib, salad, a side of your choice, and desert.  It was very very very good (can I say very one more time).  I will go as far as to say that I actually think the Prime Rib at Fleming's is better than House of Prime Rib in S.F.  The Prime Rib was very juicy, moist, full of flavor.  I ordered it medium and it was cooked perfectly.  My boyfriend had the Rib Eye steak and that was also very good.  Unlike Ruth's Chris where they drenched their steak in butter (which I love, but my boyfriend doesn't), Fleming's steak is seasoned with salt and pepper and that's all the steak really needed, you can taste the quality of the meat, it had a lot of flavor.    My boyfriend's sister ordered the Filet Mignon.  She cut a piece and ate it and thought it tasted tough.  She asked me to try a piece and I also thought the meat tasted hard and chewy.  Our server came and she asked him if the plate she had was the filet mignon and he said yes and can tell that she was not happy with her steak so he said he will get another order for her with out her even asking him.  10 minutes later the manager came over to her and said sorry and told her that he will take care of the problem for her.    So when her new piece of filet mignon came out, I can see the manager looking towards our table and I can see that there were a couple of people behind him also looking at our table (some people might find this annoying, but I think it shows that they care and want to see our reactions to see if we happy with the food or not).  We all tried her steak and the second piece that came out was outstanding.  After 5 minutes, the manager came up to my boyfriend's sister again and asked her how the steak was and of course she said it was perfect.    Our sever and his team were all very nice and provided great customer service.  The decor was very classy looking and the ambiance is very romantic if you are trying to bring a date here.  I will definitely come back to Fleming's in Vegas."}
{"text":"We have eaten at Flemings in other cities, so we have an expectation of quality, service, ambience etc. Our dinner in Las Vegas was superb and the wait staff was friendly, professional and fun. We actually tried new dishes that we hadn't had before and were so glad we did. The Cajun Shrimp and Filet Skewers were superb. The Gorgonzola dipping sauce for the filet skewers was amazing. One of our party had the lobster tail dinner and couldn't stop raving about flavor and portion size! Who ever says that about lobster tails?  A great dining experience in Las Vegas. Worth the drive!  Oh yes, and the drinks were delicious as well. We will be back !"}
{"text":"My experience with this restaurant is mixed. This was going to be one of the highlights of our Vegas holiday, A special meal to celebrate my wifes 50th Birthday. When i stopped by a few days before to make the booking, the manager I saw could not have been more helpful and welcoming. If he had been working on the night we actually had our Dinner, I am sure that our experience would have been better. When we arrived we were given no particularly warm welcome by the female maitre'D and seated at a really crappy position table, just by the entrance to the waiters station so that I was constantly being brushed past by the waiting staff. Our waiter was competent but again not very welcoming. Our Starters were good (but then it's pretty hard to screw-up a Lettuce Wedge). Our Steaks were really disappointing. Both of us ordered filet Mignon, both came over-done. Mine was so over-seasoned that I had to send it back.  When I went to the bathroom, I asked the Maitre'D if there was a note mentioning the special nature of the evening?. She confirmed that the manager taking the booking had put a note mentioning my wife's 50th birthday. I asked if she felt that our treatment had been in any way special and she admitted it hadn't. The Manger came and apologised and offered us a complimentary Dessert but, as we are both diabetic and couldn't accept, it didn't really make up for the overall poor service. If the food had been cooked properly or the Service excellent I would be prepared to re-visit and give them another chance, but getting both things wrong means that I will not be back."}
{"text":"This spot holds a special place in my heart. This is where my love affair with a perfectly cooked \"medium rare\" steak began.  It all happened on a very cold night in mid January few years back when i was in Madison on a business trip. It was a long day and my partner and I were starving, exhausted and - may I add - freezing to death. Not being familiar with an area at all, we looked up literally the closest restaurant to us on Google Maps, at this point we would settle for pretty much anything... Oh what a pleasant surprise this was!! We were Greeted by a very polite Maître d, not having reservations at all we were seated right away. The Decor is nothing special, I did like the dimmed lights however they created a soothing, pleasant atmosphere. This diner took place three years ago but I remember vividly exactly what I had and how it tasted. We started with fresh mozzarella n tomato salad, my partner had Wedge we shared both and they were both perfectly executed. These are pretty simple dishes and require little prep however freshest ingredients is a must for it to work. And work it did ...the plummest and most flavorful  tomato (off season ) I ever had, hands down. Moving on to the main course...Filet Mignon.  I've had  steaks before in various places but never had the courage to try it medium rare or even medium. My partner convinced me thats the only way it should be eaten, you are missing out on all the flavor otherwise..I guess I was too tired and hungry to care so I gave it a try....And never looked back. The wine list is impressive to go with whatever it is you having. Would recommend to anyone who is ever in the area, and if i ever end up there again will make sure to pay a visit."}
{"text":"Fleming Steakhouse at 8721 W. Charleston  has obviously lowered standards in quality of food.  I had such a difficult time cutting my steak due to the knives being so dull.  The food was mediocre and could use much more detail in flavor.  Standards for dress code were non existing.  Customers were dressed as if they were eating at a bar.  The restaurant is built very nice, however, they should have a dress code.  Price and quality of food were not balanced well.  There was more fat than meat on the ribeye steak.  They should clean the meat up better than that to give the customers fair portions for the money.  I've eaten here years ago and feel that this place is a (has been).  I will never eat there again and will make sure to pass on my experience to others."}
{"text":"If your bosses are loaded, recommend this place for your next holiday party.  You'll be on the couch watching 30 Rock reruns, reminiscing the melt-in-your-mouth, buttery rib-eye steaks and creamy garlic potatoes, for weeks following.  And the lava cakes.  Just insane.  I mean the crabcakes are uhhmayyzzing, and I don't even like crabcakes."}
{"text":"Probably the best steak restaurant in Madison. The seafood tower is outstanding as is the wine list. The sides are ala carte, but portions are bigger than Ruth's Chris and more suitable for sharing. I have never had a filet mignon here that was less than perfect (have eaten here at least a dozen times). Stay away during Restaurant Week (the specials are usually lame then anyway, being geared towards Ma and Pa Kettle's big night out). Wait staff is usually attentive, but sometimes annoyingly so. The Lava Cake is worth the twenty-minute wait."}
{"text":"As always, giving poor reviews is not something I relish. The staff and service were superb. Spot on there. My disappointment is due to the price vs perceived quality.  I could have easily reproduced a much better ribeye for $10 and my propane camping stove then the $50ish I paid.  Also a $90 seafood appetizer listed as 'market price' was a bit steep though that does not necessarily impact my rating.  Regarding that appetizer,  it did have a couple shrimp that were absolutely incredible. Easily the best shrimp I have ever had... I never knew shrimp could be so scrumptious.  Dreams are made of shrimp like that.  Will I be back? Probably not, but perhaps my steak was anomalous?...  As always, take into account multiple reviews, but in the end you'll never really know if a place suits you until you give it a try!"}
{"text":"Have dined at this site a few times before this review.  This is an excellent restaurant if you are looking for ambiance.  Husband ordered strip steak and I ordered filet mignon and while they were \"fine\", for the price we have had better.  Good food and service but over priced for what you are getting.  They have new small plates menu and we may consider trying that in the bar as opposed to eating in the dining room.  Wine prices over the top."}
{"text":"Food was amazing...the ambiance not so much. Delicious food though. And my be loves this restaurant! I would say this place is definitely worth the money. It isn't the priciest but it sure isn't the cheapest either."}
{"text":"I wrote a pretty negative review for this place a while back. But I felt the need to update it. Since that review I have came to Flemings many many more time because of a waiter named Ray. You won't believe me if I told you and people say stuff like this all of the time. But seriously, he gives the best customer service far more than any other place ever. Each time we go we request him. He treats us as if we are part of the family. I over hear him being like that with everyone. I wanted to say that so you know its not just with us. Hands down best steak house if he is your waiter. Seriously, I hope this guy receives many many bonuses."}
{"text":"Happy hour food was good . Bartender and other patrons were rude, unfriendly and snobbish. Not a place for a young crowd."}
{"text":"Very nice environment and very delicious foods! I ordered crab legs and filet mignon, for desert I had their signature chocolate lava cake! All very nice and especially the desert. Will visit again! Also very nice service, asked about if there is any special event and the man served my table checked in and see if we need anything very often."}
{"text":"My husband and I celebrated our 1 year anniversary here this past weekend. We cannot say enough good things! The servers, manager, and hostess were all very friendly and accommodating. The food was well worth the $160 check. HUGE ribeye steak, prime rib as big as my face, and the side dish of Flemings potatoes could have fed 4! My steak was cooked to a perfect med rare, and the prime rib was tender and buttery. Chipotle mac and cheese was just right. We had a couple glasses of red wine, even found a new favorite! the interactive wine menu via tablet was very cool. We also had the lava cake for dessert, and two of us couldn't finish it! was very decadent, and delicious. The staff gave us a card, congratulating us on our anniversary, and a special treat to take home. Flemings, for us, is a very special occasion type restaurant. As working class folks, my hubs and I were treated like royalty. It was not snooty or stuffy by any means. We were very comfortable there. Thanks to the Flemings staff, we both left there laughing, and completely satisfied. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were planning on going to a nice dinner on new years eve 2016, we had not yet decided which place we were going to go, We were leaning towards a local madison steakhouse, not that Flemings is not a great place, i had already eaten there before, but she got sick so i decided to get take out, flemings was the 4th or 5th place i called, i googled Madison's best steak houses and will tell you, that 4 of them were completely rude and were put off that i even asked if they would do take out, and place was so snobby and said we do not do take out let alone on new years eve, but i got a hold of a very nice lady at flemings who was very pleasant and said of course we will do carry out it just might take a little extra time, but they were very polite and the food was great, they were just as busy as these stuck up local steakhouse who acted like they could care less about one customer. Thank You to the staff at Flemings for making our evening great even though we could not go out anywhere we will defintely be back Thanks Jason"}
{"text":"My mom and I have been here a couple of times and we love it everytime. Service is always amazing and the food is delicious. The mac and cheese is my absolute favorite, you have to order a side of that. The servers are always very friendly and actually have a conversation with you, making you feel like they actually care about your time there and not just the money your spending. Same with the managers, we always get someone to come and see how we're doing. With the reservations you never wait more than 5mins past your time. Oh and when you get your receipt, make sure to do the survey, I believe its $25 off your next visit."}
{"text":"I was recently notified by a management member that he was truly sorry about the first mishap, nice to see someone is keeping tabs on their business first hand especially in this economic climate when bad critisizm can cost you lots of business. Ill give it another whirl and see what becomes of it."}
{"text":"Please note, I seldom give anything less than quite favorable reviews.  Not this time, however. Hadn't been here before, but in the mood for steak.  Efficient valet parking. Dated decor; oh, well, it's the burbs.  Had a reservation, and the restaurant was less than half full. Hostess wanted to seat us right next to the kitchen on a main aisle. We requested a quieter table, so she then tried to put us directly next to a large party, though numerous other tables were empty.  Server was cordial, but heavily accented English made him difficult to understand. Ordered the $99 for two special. Was supposed to be 28 oz porterhouse (rather grizzly), roasted cauliflower (burnt), carrots (one each of the smallest baby carrots I've ever seen; they should have been called premie carrots) and potatoes (very burnt). They were out of the suggested wine, and the server brought over a container (no bottle with a label, though it was about $15 a glass), poured a bit to taste, then walked away! Had to pour my own glass! Had plenty of room for dessert (and we are not heavy eaters) but opted not to, and to cut our losses.  After tax and tip, with one glass of wine, no salad, it was nearly $90 a person.  There are many other places to choose from in this city. Will not be back here"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here on valentines day last week. When we arrived, we were told there would be a short wait, which was no big deal to us. We only ended up waiting 5 minutes.   This is a very fancy and dressy place.  It is also on the pricey end.  They offered a free coat check, which I really appreciated.  Our waitress was great. I expected the service to be a little slow, but she was very on top of things. While we waited to be seated we ordered drinks which were poured well.  Excellent selection for wine, although I am not a wine drinker. Slightly disappointed they didn't have sangria which is the one wine I do drink. Everything is ala carte which I did not like. All the sides had to be ordered separately and for an additionally large price. We ordered French onion soup and sweet Chile pepper calamari for appetizers.  The French onion soup was very good, but I highly recommend the calamari.  I was hesitant to order it at first, because it is commonly served with marinara and lemon, but this was worth the try! As entrees we ordered the filet mignon with a side of garlic mashed potatoes and the sliced filet mignon with a side of king crab legs. The regular filet mignon (whole steak) was prepared excellent.  The garlic mashed potatoes were a bit over priced for me, but tasted fine.  You can't really fancy up mashed potatoes or they'll be bad, so we were fine with what we got.  The sliced filet mignon could have been prepared a little better, I felt they could've gotten a better medium rare cook that I requested if they would've cooked the steak as a whole then slice it.  The king crab legs were prepared very well.  The portion sizes of everything are rather on the small side, but if you go to any high end restaurant they're always like that. The wine manager stopped by to ask us how our food was. I find it very nice when managers take time to stop by and speak to their customers. I saw him stop by a few other tables, as well. We had no room for dessert but everything looked excellent on the menu.  Unfortunately this restaurant is a bit out of our price range for a weekly visit, but we will return again if we get another gift card or for a very special occasion."}
{"text":"We were sat almost immediately in a booth that was not only comfortable but also big enough for 6. There were two of us (my husband and I). We were sat with Theresa C and she is BEYOND amazing! Great food knowledge, fantastic table presence and so friendly.  We each did their Monday special which is an appetizer entree two sides and a dessert for 49.95 + tax. After a wine flight tasting where Theresa brought out multiple samples my husband and I each chose one.   The steaks we ordered were cooked to perfection the wine paired beautifully and the French onion soup was very good too.  My husband and I were celebrating my graduation from my masters degree our anniversary l, his birthday, our new jobs etc etc.   Flemings made it a wonderful experience, from the greeting through the rest of the meal. It is an experience we aren't sure to forget for a long time.   Thank you Flemings for making our night memorable. A big shout out to Theresa our server who was also incredible!!!"}
{"text":"We mistakenly decided to spend our anniversary dinner here and were quite disappointed.  The food was decent; certainly not exceptional.  I've had a better tasting steak at some of the chain steakhouses and the quality didn't come close to the high end steakhouses we've tried in the Madison area.  There was an bug on our table, which was promptly removed.  I felt like the service was equivocal to any chain restaurant and for the price and the occasion, I expected an overall better dining experience.  The staff did make a half-hearted effort towards the end of our meal, which is why I gave this review three stars instead of two."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed our first visit to Flemings. We were greeted by a smiling young lady and seated immediately. Our server, Monica was charming. Very attentive, yet not intrusive. The manager checked on us during the meal which was a nice touch.  I had a very nice salad, followed by the small plate lamb chops with Flemings potatoes and asparagus. All very nicely cooked and very tasty. My husband had the French onion soup followed by the petit fillet. Again, perfectly cooked.  All in all a very pleasant experience. We will certainly go again."}
{"text":"Ambiance...very nice. Service...very good. Our waiter Mike was professional. Wine....The house merlot was excellent.  Now for the entrees....the steak was lightly seasoned. Cooked to medium rare perfection. The only thing I did not like was the quality of the meat. It did not have the marbling consistency of prime meat. We ordered sauteed mushrooms & mac and cheese. Both were delicious.   Chocolate lava cake was divine.  My experience here was pretty good. Meat quality is a little questionable."}
{"text":"When they run their Sunday Prime Rib Special at $29.99 down from $39.99 I literally feel like I am going to be arrested on the way out for theft. Salad, Prime Rib, a Side, AND Dessert?!? Whaaaaa!   Their happy hour is nice and the staff is great."}
{"text":"Feel like feeling fancy? Fleming's has your number. This place is classy, busy and knows how to treat its customers.   I came here for my ::garble garble::th birthday celebration with my parents and boyfriend. I suggested Famous Dave's to which my parents scoffed and said I needed to go somewhere that doesn't serve meals on a trash can lid. What can I say, I'm easy to please.   This food was top notch. The steak I got was one of the best I've ever eaten in my life. I'm big on condiments so I was drawn to their F-17 sauce. I didn't even ask what it was, I just got it and I was glad I did, added a nice spice. The sides, served family style, were awesome and plentiful. Mashed potatoes piled high, green beans...they had it all. Dessert was presented beautifully with Happy Birthday written nicely with syrup on the plate.   Of course, come here for the amazing food but don't forget about the great service. The servers are extremely professional and polite. Multiple people including the manager made sure we were enjoying our meal and told me happy birthday, not in a stand on the table and sing awkwardly way, in a classy enjoy your day kind of way. I really enjoyed the experience and I don't want to wait for another big event to dine here again."}
{"text":"Fleming's has earned an upgrade in my book by bringing back the Happy Hour Vintage Vodka Martini. Two excellent Happy Hour food choices are the Sweet Chile Calamari and the New Orleans BBQ Shrimp.  Atmosphere is great and service is outstanding.  If they would bring back the seared ahi at Happy Hour I would go 5 stars."}
{"text":"Their 5 for $6 until 7PM happy hour is awesome.  Get there anywhere from 5-5:30PM or you'll be waiting.  The dining area for the bar is small so there's a chance you might miss the dining deal.   5 different cocktails, 5 wine choices and 5 appetizers:  Tenderloin Carpaccio  Calamari (good, but not great) BBQ Shrimp (had it twice now but the first time was way better) Seared Tuna  and...i can't remember the last one.  The best item is the Fleming's burger. My first visit there, I thought it'd be a slider size burger....but oh no, it's a full size burger that comes with cheese and fries or onion rings.  But I give it 4 stars and not 5 because the burger is the only choice I have for an entree.  I'm expecting their steaks to be on the list, but maybe a little more variety.    I definitely come here if I'm craving a juicy gourmet burger at a fast food chain price.  And the Cabernet is great :)"}
{"text":"What an incredible night! I was a little worried going to such a nice restaurant with my 10 month old but our server Scott (I believe that was his name) was amazing. From the recommendations for food and wine and making my little guy smile it was great. He even made my dad laugh and joked around with him. Can't say enough good things. Steaks were cooked perfectly the shrimp was excellent and the sides were perfect. Our server forget our asparagus but quickly fixed it and took it off our bill. That wasn't necessary but appreciated. I'll start saving for our next visit."}
{"text":"Location, it was odd, a strip mall parking lot isn't where you'd expect to eat a $50 steak.  Making things even odder, a valet occupied all of the restaurant specific parking.  Honestly. This building could have been an Applebee's 6 months ago and now there is a valet?  Ambience, they had the classic stake house lighting levels, but as a whole it came off lacking charm.  We gave service an 8/10, though perhaps we are spoiled when it comes to set menus (we ordered the three course winter menu).  We waited approx 5 minutes between courses, which is not how it's done.   Instead of timing, they relied on a bottomless bread service to curb our hunger as we waited for the next course.   Our scores of the food are as follows:   Bread and spread 8.5/10 Butter squash ravioli 4.5/10 Blood orange sangria 6/10 Salad 3/10 Porcini filet (broiled 9/10, pan seared 6.5/10). Oddly enough, the pan seared filet was dry and less flavorful than the broiled fillet.  Desert (forgettable) 3/10   If we go back, we will try the wine list, go for the broiled filet and call it a night."}
{"text":"We came here for happy hour and everything was great! I came here with a group of friends and we sat in the bar area. I had 2 glass of red wine that were delicious. We also ordered calamari, beef carpaccio and BBQ shrimp. Best part, my share of the bill was only $20 including tip!  Fleming's offers \"5 For $6 'Til 7\" bar menu, featuring 5 tempting appetizers, 5 premium cocktails and 5 distinctive wines by the glass -- each priced at $6 and served nightly until 7 pm."}
{"text":"Been awhile since I've been to Fleming's and, now, I remember why: bad food.  We got a promotion for steak and lobster for 50 bucks, including a salad. How bad could it be?  Well, we got a lobster tail, about 4 oz that you can buy on sale for 4.99 at Albertson's and a small filet. The lobster tail, I'm sure, could be used to resole shoes; it was so overcooked, it was crispy on the edges. The filet had the taste and texture of discount beef - Applebee's is probably better.    It's sad when the best part of tge meal was the baked potato.  I might go back, again, if they give food away."}
{"text":"If price/cost wasn't an object,  I would eat here all the time. My steak was fantastic, atmosphere was great, service was nice and attentive, and everything about this restaurant met expectations. However, I would be lucky if I go here again in the next two years. My wife and I had a $100 gift card and we still had to pay $30 more to cover our bill. The only thing I didn't like was how you have to order sides separately. Otherwise, we had a wonderful time."}
{"text":"In the interest of full disclosure, I will state that this review is based on a visit my wife and I took to this location in May of this year (anniversary dinner), and some details might be a bit fuzzy in my mind at three months' remove.  Between trips in and out of the area with my wife's best friend and me, my darling girl had seen this place many times and wanted to try it.  So ... anniversary time comes around, and instead of our usual trip to Austin's at the Texas, we went here.  Let's take this one piece at a time.  1) Entry.  Upon entering and being seated, we were overwhelmed - and not in a good way - by the NOISE from the adjacent bar.  As a fellow who has worked culinary on and off during his work-force years, it was always impressed upon me that \"fine dining\" carried an atmosphere as well as a food quality.  Not a good start to our evening. 2) Service.  Highest point of the evening.  Service was excellent.  Perhaps this night could be salvaged. 3) Food.  My wife enjoyed her wedge salad.  At this remove, I can't remember what I had for an appetizer ... which means it wasn't outstanding in any way.  We both had the rib-eye, as this is our favorite cut of steak.  Again, I point out that I have been cooking professionally on-and-off for about fifteen years.  I was always taught that herbs and spices should be a subtle caress to the palate, not a solid right cross to the jaw.  Way too heavy-handed.  (And, yes, I know that's the \"fashion trend\" these days.)  I will admit that the steaks were cooked to perfection; the guy at the grill did indeed know what \"medium rare\" really means.  Side dishes were adequate.  Whatever it was that my wife ordered for dessert was pleasing to her; as a diabetic, I passed on that.  All in all, way too expensive for a sports bar, and way too crazy for a REAL steak house.  So ... If these folks ever decide to cure their schizophrenia and determine whether they want to be the \"Cheers\" neighborhood sports bar or a true fine-dining establishment ... if they ever discover that the key to a pleasing menu is subtlety without trying to compete with the \"trendy\" places that add herbs, spices, twigs, nuts, bolts, screws, bells, lights, whistles and gongs just because someone found bottles of something at Smart and Final ... if they ever shed themselves of the culinary curiosities of architecture over tradition ... I may just return.  But someone will have to tell me, because we will not be back voluntarily.  I love my wife and my taste buds too much to subject them to this again. -- -- -- -- -- On the newly-established Nighthawk 100-point scale: 20."}
{"text":"Super Yummy! Steaks were perfectly cooked to our liking the sides of sauteed mushrooms were amazing as was the flemming potatoes! Our waitress Britney was very helpful and on top of every thing and very sweet!"}
{"text":"We went with family from Boston to celebrate my husband's aunt & Uncke's 45th wedding anniversary, kind of a big deal right. It was easy to make reservations on their sight, the atmosphere was nice & the restaurant richly decorated. On the down size for the cost the \"family sized\" portion is for a family...of two @ best. None of our eight steaks were cooked as ordered & you could smell the shrimp before they placed it on the table. We regularly eat @ Del Frisco's but thought with such a large party we should try something a bit more financially friendly. The prices are relatively the same with the exception of the quality and quantity of food. Next time we'll stick with what we know. I don't recommend Fleming's. On a side note one of our steaks was so rare (ordered medium well) it had to be rejected. I don't know what the health code policy is but they took the same steak that had been cut from was put back on the grill & returned with the bites that had been cut off and sufficiently overlooked. Several of us ordered the filet mignon, all of which we're \"grissely.\""}
{"text":"Sides are good, Steak is mediocre.  Decent steak house for a chain restaurant. Cesar Salad was good. Filet was a 5 out of 10. Wife had the bone in ribeye, that was a much better choice. Lava Cake was also mediocre. Ambiance is better than most places.  Great place of a relaxing dinner on a Tuesday night but not good enough for a special night out."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places for happy hour. But the newly renovated bar was full this evening. I asked the receptionist if she could seat us in the main dining area and she could not. So my husband and I left to Bonefish next door. Let me tell you, they have great absolut martinis with stuff blue cheese olives on happy hour $5.75 and this amazing mussels dish as an appetizer $11.50 (very fulfilling btw). So affordable and definitely be coming back. Not as crowded as Flemings and the ambiance there is very pleasant. Our new favorite place, since Flemings couldn't accommodate us. Go to Bonefish next door, you'll be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"This place is mediocre in everyway.  For one of the most expensive places around, that is a huge disappointment.  Just went with my wife and two friends. The steaks were fine, but not great -- a little overcooked and under-seasoned.  One highlight is that the Flemings potatoes are great.  The wait staff was attentive but clumsy.  They interrupted constantly at the worst times in conversation (and not just the waitress -- everyone, even the manager).  There is some strangeness when you come in where they ask if you want to swap the white napkin at the table for black napkins.  Just awkward and a little bumbling.  The whole crew could use to take a trip to Chicago or NY and see how a well-run steak place does their thing.  If you are going to spend $100 per person on a meal, it better be spot on in everyway.  This is not that."}
{"text":"Amazing; would totally come back here again. It was an ultimate dining experience. Ian was the server  top notch service. Marissa was the manager. Made it an experience worth yelping great management.  They accommodated us even though we went in a few minutes before closing. I've been to a few Fleming's and a bunch of fine dining places this place exceeded expectations and by far the best Fleming I've been to yet. Wow. Just amazing. Check it out  when you're in town"}
{"text":"I have wined and dined here more than 30 times over the past decade and have NEVER had poor service or anything less than delicious food.  You can pay more for a steak at many other restaurants in town,  but this Flemings is comfortable and relaxing.  They take great care to make sure your dining experience is more than satisfactory.   No loud music or pretense here.   Great wine list and the bartenders are all class."}
{"text":"To start off, if you're going to dine here, you need to know it's $75-$100 a person... no need to reduce the rating for this. tip: Check out the online website to get a feel before you go.   This was my first time coming to this restaurant. A group of 6 of us went out for an early dinner (4pm) to celebrate my father's 60th birthday. All of our food was excellent!  Pros: The food was fantastic and the staff was very friendly. The mushroom ravioli (app) was out of this world and could have easily been ordered as just a meal. The steak was cooked perfectly and the staff let us know how many sides we should order to feed our group; they were right on target. The restaurant was very comfortable with the low lighting and view of the kitchen. Our orders were 100% correct with no errors or anything needing to be sent back.   Cons: The only reason I didn't give this a 5 (which I saw in other reviews) was the time it took from when we sat down for someone to take our drink orders. Someone promptly showed up the drink menus and let us know they'd give us a few minutes.... a few minutes was over 10 before they finally came back just to take drink orders. With all 6 of us looking around for a waiter, we were shocked no one picked up on it since we were the only ones in the restaurant (again, a 4 pm reservation and a bee line view to all the staff by the kitchen).   My husband and I plan to be back for larger occasions, but will be sure to order drinks right away :)"}
{"text":"We recently held a private event at Fleming's Prime Steakhouse & Wine Bar and were extremely impressed with the Private Dining Director & staff.  When we started the planning process the Private Dining Director communicated promptly and worked with us to tailor set up and menu options to fit our group's needs.  The evening of our event went smoothly since the Fleming's staff was so attentive to our guests.  The food was EXTREMELY filling and the desserts were a huge hit, especially the Turtle Cheesecake!!  If you are looking for a private venue to wine & dine visitors make sure to check out Fleming's!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  The ribeye I ordered was cooked perfectly.  It was good size and an overall very flavorful piece of meet.  My wife ordered the filet, which she felt was slightly overcooked, but good nonethless.  We shared two sides, the chipotle cheddar mac and cheese and creamed spinach.  Both were great.  The walnut turtle pie we split for desert was very good as well.    Our server was attentive, friendly, energetic, and knowledgable of the menu items.  However, it did take us a while to get seated.  Our reservations were for 7pm, we arrived 10 mintues, and had to wait 45 minutes to be seated.  The hostesses told us they were \"running behind\" and said the wait would be 10 to 15 minutes.  Things happen, but the hostesses did not handle the sitation well.  They misquoted the wait time by over 30 minutes and seemed to be very stand-offish with everyone waiting in the lobby area.    If it wasn't for the seating/hostess situation, I may have rated this 5 stars instead of 4.  Again, the food was great."}
{"text":"This place is solid.   Service is top notch, if not leaving you feeling a little \"I don't know what to do with my hands\". i.e. scrapping your tables off with crumbs and shining the wine glasses in the dining room in view of the patrons.  We were promptly served with the bread basket with not one, but two specialty butters. On this day, it was garlic and the other one was champagne infused(?).  Everything is a la cart, we got the petit filet with baked potato and dry-aged ribeye with creamed spinach. The cuts of meat are exquisite, they cut like butter. There is a deep flavor to the meats that is consistent throughout each bite. Both orders were cooked to perfection, very rarely as described in the exact way you pictured. The baked potato was pretty standard, although it could have very well been double baked as the skin had a nice crust to it. The creamed spinach was an attention-stealer, it was light, without the taste of a heavy roux, with a nice balance of garlic and onion.   As we waited for our coats to be unchecked (yes, this is a service they provide!), we overheard that there was a 1 1/2 hour wait for Tuesday dining room service.  Tip: If you're in a hurry or just want a more casual dining experience, eat in the bar area. There are about three booths, and a dozen or so stools around the bar. They have their own menu for usually 1/3 of the price. You get the same fries they serve in the dining room a la cart in the bar with your Prime Burger meal!  Pro Tip: Flemings is owned by Bloomin' Brands, which means if you have an Outback gift card, for example, you can use the gift card here."}
{"text":"Always a great experience. This is our go to restaurant for great steaks, service, and ambiance."}
{"text":"Really a great steakhouse. Great service, the meats are perfectly cooked. The lobster tempura is to die for. Nice wine list. The price is up there but it is a high end (but casual) place. Can not go wrong. It's money well spent."}
{"text":"By far one of my favorite Steak places.  Their Happy Hour is second to none and the service matches!  Amber is an awesome bartender and anticipates your orders with ease.  Their bar area is a tad small so get here early if your just going to the bar."}
{"text":"Fleming's includes prices on their menus. If you make a reservation, order a meal and then experience sticker shock when you get the tab, that's not their fault. That said - it is Fleming's responsibility to provide food and service that will make you forget you paid $49 for an a la carte petite filet.   On our last visit, it was the price and not the experience that we talked about on the ride home.   Four of us went on a Wednesday night to celebrate a birthday. It was early and the main dining room was fairly empty. The wait staff was great. Very welcoming and attentive. The iPad with the wine app was cumbersome on the table but an okay diversion. Ultimately it was the food that disappointed us.   All four of us had steak. The steaks were good, but that's all they were. Three out of the four steaks were cooked as requested. One of the filets was served medium to well done instead of the medium rare that was requested. I know this sounds snooty, but all the filets seemed more appropriate for Outback Steakhouse and not the higher end of the Bloomin' Brands spectrum of restaurants.     The special was a combo plate that included a beef filet, a salmon filet and two scallops. The salmon was kind of dry and the scallops were small. The creamed spinach was all cream and no spinach. Each spoonful spread out on your plate more like soup than the side dish it should have been. A shrimp cocktail appetizer and sides of potatoes and onion rings were okay but, nothing knocked our socks off.   Why didn't we send anything back? A lack of time and an abundance of hunger. Plus, we were celebrating a birthday and complaining about stuff would dampen the mood. We kind of hoped (and expected) the kitchen would get it right the first time. We did say something about the spinach and they offered a different side (we didn't try anything else) and took the item off our bill.   At the end of the meal we were given a box of truffles and a $25 gift card for our next visit (the card expires in two months).   To sum up, the staff is great but the kitchen let us down that Wednesday night. If you go, make sure you have time to insist that the food meets your expectations. You're paying a lot of money and the staff genuinely seems like they want to make sure you're happy when you leave.   One unexpected bonus after our experience is that the bills from other restaurants we've dined at all seem like absolute bargains.   Everyone can have an off night so I'm sure we'll give Fleming's another try - it just might take us a while to save up the cash."}
{"text":"I really do reccomend this resturant to every patient and coworker that i have. Some people have mixed reviews about the food but to my personally its great. I really like the flemings potatoes! Servers are the best part about it! Theyre SOOOOO professional."}
{"text":"Just celebrated our 10 year anniversary here and it was perfect. The staff and service was beyond professional. I can't think of a better place to celebrate special occasions.  We both ordered the filet minion with crab stuffed lobster tail with some sides and it was the perfect meal.  Thanks Flemings"}
{"text":"Phenomenal!  Best meal in all of Madison, hands down. My husband and I are never disappointed when we eat here. Filet Oscar style is my fav here. Great cut of meat and crab. Also the dessert berries & cream and the lava cake are super yummy. The dry aged meats are great here too and worth the $$$$. Great service. We liked it here better than Ruth Chris, Jonny Delmonicos, and the Tornado Room.  Loved it!!!!"}
{"text":"I have never had better service anywhere in my life, as it should be when you are paying that much for a nice dinner out. The food was amazing. I highly recommend the prime rib, medium rare. The white cosmo is also worth trying."}
{"text":"Bethany was a excellent server! She was really sweet and made me enjoy my experience.  I have to admit it was the best service I ever had. If you go to this location ask for her! You will be very happy."}
{"text":"Best steak in Las Vegas. I love their Filet and selection of sauces  that comes with it. The service is great and they know your face if you go there again. It's the place to have a romantic dinner with great food."}
{"text":"Always the best! Love the staff and the food has always been spectacular! Had trouble finding parking and the guy took my car and got us in right away last time. SPECTACULAR!"}
{"text":"Great place for the prime rib special on Sundays and Mondays periodically during the year.  The prime rib is excellent with a great wedge salad, side and outstanding desserts.  Check the website or call.  You can't beat this special.  The service has always been excellent."}
{"text":"We couldn't have been happier with Fleming's .  First of all, we are bar people.  When we go out to eat, we like to sit at the bar if at all possible because we enjoy the constant attention and rapport that a good bar staff should provide.  Amber and Brennan both excelled at personality, attentiveness, fun and knowledge of their products.   We thoroughly enjoyed playing with the Ipad wine list that allows you to choose from over 200 wines with full descriptions and vintner's notes.  A fun 'spin the bottle' option allows a random selection of wine.  Other awesome feature's include selections from the director of wine and paring suggestions for each course.  We found a new wine that we both absolutely love! Oh, but the food...delicious is not a strong enough word.  You can choose from full entrees, small plates at the bar, salads and/or a variety of appetizers."}
{"text":"You will not be disappointed! While we typically eat at the bar instead of the dining room, we have always received top notch, professional service. Cocktails are shaken and stirred up one at a time right in front of you which is excellent. The steaks are to die for, the Happy Hour menu rocks, and to top it all off the creme brulee here has become my absolute favorite dessert in the world. Be prepared to drop some $$$ but in my opinion this place is nearly as good as it can get."}
{"text":"My company was looking for a steakhouse to have our dinner. this turned out to be the perfect option. From the moment I started inquiring and working with Kelly I knew this was a great place. Kelly was accommodating and helpful. She explained all the options we had available to us.  We had a private room, which was perfect for our group. It was a lovely room with plenty of space to mingle.  The service from the moment we arrived was 5 star.  Our wait staff was attentive and kind. our food was brought out in quick succession so that we were all served within moments of one another.  We started with a cheese and fruit platter which was very good. The bread served was crunchy and warm. Two butter choices.  The salad crisp and fresh. Perfectly dressed. the entrees were cooked to every ones desire and there was not a morsel left on anyone's plates.  The cheesecake was a slice of heaven.  Our president was delighted with our choice. We will be back.  Thank you Kelly and staff!!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try a new steak house. I have been to a few around town. I have to say that for the price versus quality and taste, this place is expensive. The steak was okay but the had to fire it again because it was under cooked. The food lacks taste and is very plain. I will not be back again, especially with so may other good steak houses around town."}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous. We ordered a couple of cocktails, which naturally contributed to the rather high tab - but everything was beyond delicious & totally worth it! Our server, Denise, was extremely attentive and good-natured :) The lava cake is house specialty - the perfect finishing touch & generous enough to share. Definitely worth saving room for! We like the Fleming's in Baltimore, and were excited to try the one in Madison. We were not disappointed."}
{"text":"I had a great meal at Flemings. I started the night with a glass of the Downtown Abby Ale while I was waiting for me table on Christmas Eve. They oversold the place, but alas, it was Christmas, they wanted to take care of as many people as possible.  As for the ale, It's a great, hoppy beer from New York. I really enjoyed the flavor from the hops. As soon as I got seated, I moved on to a beautiful Caesar Salad with fried capers. I know it sounds weird, but trust me, it was delicious. It was a bit delayed, but they brought us fresh bread with two different Arizona butters that they make in house. Both were delightful. The only thing that would have made it better would have been if I got the bread prior to my salad course.  As for my main entree, I went for the bone in rib eye. The flavor was out of this world. I asked for rare, and that was exactly what I got. At that point, I was ready for another beer. I was delighted to see the Sierra Nevada Torpedo Extra IPA. Such a treat if you like IPA's and hoppy beers.  The only thing that I would recommend, is getting an accompaniment of cabernet butter to go with your steak. As for sides, the best way to go is with the creamed spinach and the blue cheese infused mashed potatoes.   Overall, the dining experience was a 3.5/5 due to some timing issues. As for the food, I would give it a solid 4.5/5"}
{"text":"The food is good but one of the managers is racist AF if you are a Hispanic don't bother you won't get a good service he only cares about white customers is mess up you don't get the same service like everyone else.."}
{"text":"My friend wanted to come here since we were nearby and wanted a nice meal. The service per usual was top notch. The atmosphere also was nice.  I tried completely different food from my last visits and went with a bone-in tenderloin with truffle poached lobster topped with a bearnaise sauce and a loaded baked potato for the side. The steak was perfectly cooked, tender, and juicy. The accompanied seafood was also cooked well. For dessert we had a chocolate lava cake which also hit the spot.  This food experience was so different from my past ones that I felt like it was only fair and update my previous review. Everything came out as expected and was solid."}
{"text":"As far as steaks go, and that's the only reason we ever go there, it's about as good as any of the \"major\" steakhouses in Las Vegas. It seems always fairly crowded, but when we want a good steak and don't want to drive to The Palm or Morton's (which is almost never for me), Fleming's is great.  I can't vouch for the Wine Bar, however, as I only drink \"scotch\" wine. Give it try, pricey, but good. Can't vouch for \"Happy Hour\" either, never been at that time. How uncivilized.   I'm not sure what \"dressy\" means, but leave your fanny packs at home and look nice."}
{"text":"Great steak and excellent service. Highly recommended! Everyone from the hostess, to the waiter, to the manager, and the bartender...they couldn't have been more hospitable!"}
{"text":"Always exceptional service and excellent meats. When we want a perfect Filet or Prime rib..we always go to this Flemmings.  Save room for dessert. The carrot cake is the most delicious. Savory butter to spread on your bread and taste perfect cooked steaks."}
{"text":"We just had our 25th wedding anniversary and celebrated with a great meal at Flemings. An associate of my wife's had given us a $100 gift card and we had saved it for this occasion.  We had heard wonderful things about Flemings and were not disappointed. From the hostess, to the server, to the manager, all were exceptional.  We were treated as very special guests. They were not stuffy or \"prim and proper\" It was like having a meal with new friends whose only concern was that we had a great dinner.... and we certainly did.  Our server's name was Bill and he was excellent. Charming, friendly, and oh so perfect. We had been looking forward to the dinner and knew from the website what we wanted. We started on the bread and split a glass of the Sangria, and ordered a nice hearty Tobin James Zinfadel, which at $40 a bottle was very reasonably priced. We started with the appetizers. I went with the \"Wicked Cajun\" shrimp and Christiné had the Carpaccio.  Both were very tasty.   For the main course I had the New York steak with a Lobster tail add-on with big delicious onion rings and a pile of fine delicate, shoestring french fries and Christiné had what turned out to be 2 (two) Lobster tails with the creamed spinach.  (obviously we were not watching calories on this night!)  Christiné could not rave enough about the Lobster... but felt the spinach was a bit too creamy...luxuriously so... but we prefer a little more vegetable and less cream.  My steak was beautiful.  Melt in your mouth tasty, with only a little salt and pepper. I haven't had lobster in ages and enjoyed that as well. I hadn't ordered french fries in over a year and onion rings longer than that...and I must say these were among the best ever.  I was on a roll. I wanted a dessert too! I ordered the 3 layer carrot cake and a coffee and Christiné wanted a Grappa, (which they didn't have) but settled for a nice cognac. The Sangria and Zinfandel had already given us a very nice buzz...but I was driving so I went with the coffee.  The cake was about 66% super sweet, creamy frosting and 34% heavy, rich, and tasty cake.  Just about the opposite percentages of what I prefer, and it was huge, obviously meant for sharing! It also came with bowl of fresh whipping cream! Definitely a calorie BOMB!  I scraped off a lot of frosting and I actually needed the whipped cream, and sips of the good black coffee to cut the sweetness... but once I got the mix down... it was really good!   This was one of the best meals I have ever had, and certainly the most expensive that we have had in our 27 years together. By the time we added in the tip (25% for exceptional service!) we added another $230 to the $100 card - but without regrets. It was a great meal and very nice way to celebrate 25 years of marriage.  BTW... I did not eat all my steak and Christiné had a half lobster tail left, which they boxed up for us. They made for a great lunch addition two days later.  They also gave us a little box of 4 truffles as anniversary gift when we left, and a follow up thank you email.  This place is a class act.  We will go back! (the happy hour should be great!)"}
{"text":"Loved it was my first time on v day had a good time you can taste the quality in meat and we both had a prime rib special it was so much food it was crazy well worth my money server seened alittle over whelmed or just moves a little to fast for this style atmosphere in my opinion but was anything that made my experience bad at all I serve to and he met my expectations that always means alot to over all I would say that I will for sure be back my wife was impressed with the surprise for v day and when shes happy im happy thats Fleming's try it out guys I hope your experience is as good as mine was!"}
{"text":"I have dined here on several occassions since I moved to Las Vegas 14 months ago. Flemings is always good. I have had several cuts of steak and they always cook it perfect and have tasted most of their sides.   I am inclined to post a review based on our most recent dining experience on Mother's Day evening for dinner. We had a reservation, but when we arrived there was a ton of people waiting outside. We spoke to the hostess and I guess Mother's Day dinner is their most popular evening (most likely due to all the moms getting a break for once!). We ended up having to wait around 15-20 minutes passed our reservation time. I usually get frustrated by this, but I was impressed that half-way through our meal a manager came to our table and gave us a $25 gift card per person to use at a later date. We never complained about the reservation being untimely either.   I was very impressed by their customer service. High-five Flemings!"}
{"text":"This is your classic American steak house with your classic american menu choices. This is also your classic amazing tasting steak! We celebrated a birthday dinner here and was not disappointed. First the price... of course it's a little on the expensive side, this isn't your outback steak house Friday night steak outings,  this is good ol' american culinary classic steak house.   So no surprise seeing $30-$50 cuts of beef on the menu with $10 side choices. Bread was fresh with two choices of butter ( can't remember what they were infused with but i remember both being delicious, sorry!) We started with calamari (rhode island style with hot peppers and topped with a sweet chill sauce).  This didn't blow me away, in fact i wish the sweet chili sauce was on the side as it made the calamari a little soggy (maybe if you order this try asking for it on the side).  Wine list was satisfactory, we went with a Red. Parducci Syrah, not too dry and a delicious paring for red meat!  STEAK: Ordered the prime ribeye (my fav cut) cooked to medium temp. Perfectly cooked with juices flowing as i cut into my steak.  Seasoned well with a nice char on the outside, perfectly pink in the middle and a little fat on the cut was just what i needed.  The girlfriend ordered the Filet mignon which was also cooked to her liking and was tender beyond a Katherine Heigl rom-com! You can choose to order 4 different complimentary sauces on the side ( we tried the bernaise and peppercorn with the latter being my preferred choice)although a good steak doesn't need sauce, sometimes i like a little variety.   SIDES: Ordered the Flemings potatoes (scalloped potatoes topped with cream, jalapenos and cheddar). Don't fear the jalapenos, they weren't spicy at all and just added a nice little kick to the potatoes. I recommend this as a side! We also ordered roasted mushrooms. It was a perfect blend of button and portobello  mushrooms with some fresh garlic cloves that perfectly complimented the steak. (why was the mushroom invited to the party? Because he was fun-gi! harhar)  We were too full for desert (and maybe a little tipsy from the bottle of wine..a little) but would like to try the lava cake on our next visit.  SERVICE: Well above average.  After checking in with the host, we were promptly escorted to our table preceded by a \"welcome mr. surname\". When our server approached us, he stated \"so who's birthday our we celebrating?\" I totally forgot when i made the reservation online, there was a drop down box with special events and i had selected birthday. Nice little touch from Flemings. We were waited upon by at least 3 different servers who were ALL Friendly and made nice little quips of conversations most ending with laughter. A supervisor also checked in with us post meal to ask how everything was that evening.  The service definitely had me bringing up the tip percentage (maybe the wine helped too) to well above standards.  Overall a memorable birthday dinner.  Food was delicious. Service was excellent. Ambiance was what we expected (not romantic per se but still classy ). We would definitely be coming back (maybe on prime rib sundays for $29.99..say whaaaa?!)  I still like Lawrys/Mortons/Smith & Wollensky but Flemings is a great choice for STEAK NIGHT!"}
{"text":"We have been dining at this Flemings location for many years. The service, ambiance and food have always been amazing. Their steaks are excellent and Flemings potatoes are to die for. Wine selection is huge with many choices by the glass. Our server Rory was excellent. We have had him many times. At our last visit, I was confused about which wine to get. He went above and beyond and got me a sample taste of the wine. We ended up getting a bottle! I will def request him again."}
{"text":"My favorite place for a wonderful dinner.  I have been coming to this particular restaurant over the last 12 years.  Delicious food, great drinks and the chocolate lava cake is out of this world! Love the ambiance,  the service and friendly waiters!"}
{"text":"Date night finally with hubby, we've waited a long time to finally go here , the service was as excellent; our server was awesome we got the Chile lime calamari, very delicious and we loved the Cesar salad but the 2 sure and turf we both ordered, was very disappointing, fist the girl brought out 2 plates that were not ours? Then his steak was over cooked and looked lobster very rubbery, and mine had 2 huge cuts in it and was very dry and my King crab legs were both ni"}
{"text":"Luv old school Flemings esp the Manhattan Beach location but skip the Vegas version. Made a reservation online, but had to come in earlier since kiddo was hungry and we had just arrived from our road trip. In retrospect, I made a bad choice coming here.   The HH bar was crowded because it was so small and was told we couldn't order from the HH menu because we had a kid with us.  That sucked. We were taken to the dining room.   I got the feeling we were being prejudged by what we were wearing (shorts n flips).  I'm sure the food here is good, but we never got a chance to try it. There is no kid menu or alternative. Super annoyed because I knew this was going to be a bad dining experience with a cranky kid and a long wait for water and food. Not what I expected from Flemings.  At least they could have offered a drink, no  apology for the inconvenience, just attitude."}
{"text":"Overall average. I was a little disappointed.  Of course I had the filet. It was cooked as I ordered but seasoned a little heavily. I'm not sure it was really a prime cut of filet more like choice. It just didn't have the right flavor composition.   Sides: mashed potatoes and creamed spinach neither of which I would order again. The spinach was too creamy. It was like warm cream cheese with a little spinach. The potatoes were supposed to be garlic Parmesan but i dont recall any garlic or Parmesan flavor but there was a puddle of grease on top and it didn't taste like butter.   Cheesecake was good but after reading the other reviews I wish I had gotten the carrot cake."}
{"text":"I came here with my husband for our Anniversary dinner. We had a wonderful and memorable experience here. From the moment my husband booked a reservation and throughout our meal, the staff was attentive and courteous. Our food was amazing, perfectly cooked and delicious. Yes, it is a bit pricey but well worth it. We will definitely come again! Thank you Fleming's!"}
{"text":"This review is long overdo!  Flemings is our go to place every Christmas Eve.  We absolutely LOVE the food and service at Flemings!  We always make a reservation, as they do get very busy especially on holidays.  We are generally seated within 10 minutes, or less of our reserved table time.    Once seated, we are welcomed by a server who regardless of how busy they are, always gives us the attention we expect... not too pesty and not aloof.  The reason for the four star is that this past Christmas Eve, the service was more on the aloof end... we waited far too long for simple requests, like sugar for the coffee, a clean fork, etc... so much that we had to remind our server!  The food however was AMAZING!  I generally order the filet, which melts in your mouth, however this time I ordered the chicken breasts and they were delightful!  Full of flavor!  Our side orders were the mac n cheese \"YUMMY\" and the Flemings Potatoes \"out of this world YUMMY\"!    I highly recommend Flemings on W. Charleston in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"I hate chain restaurants and I'm especially sick of the uber steakhouse trend.  However, on the advice of some reviews, I gave Flemings a try when visiting my cousin in Las Vegas a couple of years ago.  It remains  possibly the best steak I've ever had.  They cooked it a bit too long and I was never able to get the attention of a waiter to have it fixed, thus the one star knock.  I'd return in a heartbeat, and the upside of it being a chain is that I may be able to recreate that magic closer to home one day."}
{"text":"We are always hesitant to try steak chains, but Fleming's did a good job. The bread and cheese spreads were delicious; it could be a meal in itself. We started off with shrimp cocktail. Very good. I had the classic Caesar which was a very large salad. I shared over half of it with my husband. He had the prime bone in ribeye and was cooked to perfection! He said it was done perfect and had wonderful flavor. I had the Lobster tail which was very good. We shared a side of the mashed potatoes with blue cheese melted instead of butter, I would go back just for those! We had a very nice bottle of wine. I must say that they have an incredible wine selection. The waiter was very friendly and the decor was nice."}
{"text":"My first time here, and the only thing I actually enjoy is the virgin sugar cane drinks... Yum and the wagyu strip steak... Rest of the stuffs are alright... Take the look on the photos I posted..."}
{"text":"We've tried the Happy Hour once and weren't too terribly impressed. Got the gift cards at Costco and went on a little date tonight. Holy SH**! WE had the Tomohawk to share and it was INCREDIBLE. Cooked perfectly, seasoned excellently. I was sad when it was gone.  It came with the sauces that we're all wonderful, however the steak didn't need anything. The service was impeccable. A lot of reviews talk about the bad service. I find that if I don't act like a snot to the waiters, I get treated pretty awesome.  The ambiance is nice.  I like the energy of a busy,  bustling restaurant so I really enjoyed the crowd. We said we'd go for that steak once a week!"}
{"text":"Been to Fleming's twice, one time was for restaurant week.  Don't bother during restaurant week unless you're okay with a sampler plate and bad service.  What little food you get is decent, but the place is over priced and over rated."}
{"text":"Fantastic! The food was delicious and the staff was overly courteous and pleasant. Our server Jennifer was excellent, very informative and was on her toes. This was our first visit and we knew nothing about the menu. We had the filet mignon wrapped in bacon with crab stuffed shrimp and mashed potatoes (A special). My husband and I both agreed that this was the most tender piece of meat we had ever eaten. I can't even begin to explain it, it was melting in my mouth and had a wonderful flavor. I am not a seafood eater but the crab stuffed shrimp was delicious!  This was an anniversary dinner and a special dining experience. It is pricey but the food was worth it. The ambience was very nice, somewhat dark with low lighting. (My huband did notice that for it being all adults in there, it was a little on the loud side-- but not a big deal).  When we were leaving, we were given a box of chocolates for our anniversary. Thoughtful."}
{"text":"I ordered a petite filet mignon, and my partner ordered Chilean sea bass with spinach, and we shared a side order of asparagus.  The entrees and asparagus were nicely prepared and tasty, but my steak definitely was not tender.  (tasty, yes, tender, no)  Service was excellent and the atmosphere was quiet, pleasant, and classy.  Fleming's is pricier than pricy though and not really worth what you pay for.  Think \"meat on a plate\" with zero accoutrements.  With no appetizers, no alcohol, no desserts, and a single shared side dish, our meal came to just south of $200."}
{"text":"Fleming's did it again!!! Our family is visiting from Newcastle, England and we wanted to have a nice dinner before they left. We chose Fleming's from previous experiences (great ones!) and again, we were delighted and so were they. We started with the Portobello Mushroom Ravioli appetizer that was fabulous to say the least. We didn't deviate and had the small bites, lamb chops and sliced filet...the meat melts in your mouth. Our guests had the full size filet and blue cheese mashed potatoes for the side. The potatoes were absolutely delicious, I couldn't stop 'tasting' them (actually I ate most of them, just a little taste here and there). Also, if you like Pinot Noir, you must try the Garnet, nice and smooth, wonderful accompaniment with our choice of entrees. I wish I could remember our server, he was great..perfect timing, never intrusive, informative and nice! Hearing and recognizing our guests accents, he gave us a huge smile and said \"Cheers!\". Perfect topping for a wonderful evening out. Fleming's never disappoints!!!"}
{"text":"Simply a chain experience that just does not hold up at this price point in the Madison area. No local beers. High volume pop music playing in the dining area. Obligatory TV's at the bar. Cheesy feel that screams faux fancy. Consistent service and food preparation, but far overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"Great food, great service and a bit pricey. The creme brûlée is very good! However the entree didn't come with a side.. Seem to be bit stingy.."}
{"text":"So here is the inside on Sunday Brunch at Flemings. We arrived at 11:30 a.m. just a few cars in the lot and thought maybe this was not a good idea WRONG!! This turned out to be one of the Best Brunch experiences I have had in a long long time. Las Vegas is packed with Sunday Brunch choices and this was a first time visit here. Greeted by a very nice smiling young hostess. Taken to a booth tight away and just a few customers so far. Complimentary Passion Fruit infused Orange Juice Mimosas. Complimentary Drop Biscuits with Apricot Jam. My lady had the Chef's Prix Fee item, Fresh Berries and I mean Super Fresh, Blue Crab Omelette with Blistered Tomatoes Awesome she said, and a Flourless Chocolate Cake Slice with Berries and Strawberry Coolee. I had a Omelette with 2 cheese, caramelized onions, avocado, roasted red peppers and a side of Bernaise Sauce with Baby roasted potatoes.  One more Carafe of Mimosas.  The total bill, now wait for it Only $54.00 - $65.00 with tip.  Our sever was awesome Bethany Klein, I know her name because she made a point of us knowing it.  The manager stopped by and checked on us as well, a nice touch.  Best brunch experience in a long time, I know I said earlier.  Quiet, Music playing in the background, table linens.  Be back very soon!!"}
{"text":"One of the places with the best steak and service. My boyfriend took me out for a birthday dinner and I couldn't ask for better service or steak. The lava cake was nothing but a mouthful of delicious chocolate melting in your mouth. Looking forward to come back again sometome."}
{"text":"Birthday dinner gone bad. It wasn't what I expected but I shouldn't have expected much from a chain restaurant. First time here and the last. I was very confused with each and every dish...I was not a big fan of the raw pieces of red pepper on the crab cakes sauce, the bernaise sauce wasn't saucy it was thick and not enough on the main steak with crab, waited 50 mins from our appitizer to our entrées and our waitress didn't even bother to come over to our table and tell us it would be out soon or apologize for the wait until I called her over. The chipotle mac and cheese, flemings potatoes and green beans were ok but nothing special. The Sea bass dish was so BLAND, no flavor at all! The fish itself was cooked well but the broth and raw thick cut tomatoes, spinach and onion and supposedly \"crispy potatoes\" as a garnish did not work for me. The manager did come over and apologize and took care of my dish, appitizer and dessert so I'll give them two thumbs up for that but I was still disappointed. Plus, they gave me a box of truffles and a $25 giftcard. That I will re-gift because I'm not eating here again."}
{"text":"Oh how disappointing. If not for this review, an absolutely forgettable experience. Here's the damage:  Tough, chewy, tasteless lobster tail for $55. Highway robbery. Maybe 10 asparagus with the dry stalks still attached to the ends, $13.  One dangerously weak whiskey drink, the Emerald Isle, whose price I thankfully cannot find.   Here's the redemption:  one plate of the Boneless Braised Short Ribs (with truffle-parsley mashed potatoes, natural au jus, horseradish-cream sauce). I can't find the price, and I don't care, because this was the only saving grace of the evening as far as I was concerned. My dining buddy was too emotional from an event before and probably too drunk to care much. These were quite possibly the best ribs I've tasted ever, certainly within recent memory.   The problem(s):  the cost; the frantic, distracted, absent, and--at the end--somewhat pushy waiter (DESSERT! from a woefully uninspiring selection); and an overall culinary experience not far removed from the expectations of a typical Strip buffet all made for one lackluster meal that we had been looking forward to for months. If not for the ribs, the cost vis-a-vis the unappealing textures and fleeting tastes would have made this a 2-star experience. Despite each of us using $25 gift cards, I had a hard time justifying the cost for this meal even at such a reduced dollar amount.   The grand total for this was about $110, or $177 total with the two shots of tequila añejo my friend ordered. Those shots? Superb. Too bad they didn't bring the bottle out to show us what was being served at $30 per shot, and that those shots had nothing to do with the restaurant quality itself.  I'd not come back here for anything other than those ribs, and even for those I'd only go if someone else were paying and taking on the risk of failure. If you want a better steakhouse experience for less cost in Las Vegas, you won't have to look far to find it."}
{"text":"The steak was great and the service was amazing. I had the creme brulee for dessert and I was highly disappointed. It wasn't creamy and it still had little lumps in it from the tempered eggs. I'm not sure what sugar they used for the top but it was not good. I would still go back."}
{"text":"My family went here so many times in 2 years that everyone including the water servers knew our names; the service was impeccable and the food was perfect. Does price really matter when food is prepared perfectly? They have some customer computer profiler thing and we were regulars so got treated greatly.   But, recently, maybe because of the bad economy, the customer treatment is not up to par. A bunch of new clumsy staff made my last few visits unbearable. It took a dozen meals to get them to finally combine two ppl from my family into one name on their detailed customer computer profile thing. The tables aren't obsessively cleaned anymore like they used to be (I preferred it when they were!). The steaks are rarely done rare enough; I brought a hunting buddy of mine in here and they well-cooked a steak... what a waste! 90% of the customers in the place are just from big companies who can write off expensive group dinners (taxpayers pay for this).  One night there was a campus event ending in the area at 6 PM. It was 4:30, and we went here to eat a quick meal; my family does everything very fast (we usually talk to the waitstaff twice during a meal). Anyways, there wasn't one customer in the restaurant. Three door girls (new clueless ones who did not know us) turned one of my family members away and said that due to the reservations of the people from campus, they couldn't let us dine here. We have spent thousands and thousands of dollars here, enough to buy a nice car. We would have eaten, left, and left a 30% tip before anyone showed up from campus, but we were turned away. I have never been so offended, they blew off one of their best customers!  Go somewhere else! Try Tornado steakhouse in Madison. Carnevor in Milwaukee is very nice too!"}
{"text":"This is the best high end steak chain in Madison. It has everything you would want including a very nice atmosphere. It is large enough that you do not feel like you are always right on top of the next table and can have a reasonably private conversation.The service is consistently good, but as with all chains you need to check the doneness of the steak and send it back if it is overcooked. I am pretty picky and they did overcook my steak once, but the free desert to make up for it was appreciated. Only the Tornado Room (the best in Madison) has a perfect record for me in Madison. I have had both very good business meetings and romantic dinners at Flemings. I agree with the other review that says the wine is over priced."}
{"text":"A good friend of mine has this thing about coupons. She cannot let one go to waste. She jokes that her grave marker will read, \"I got this headstone with a coupon\". I think that is true. Anyway, she received a coupon for Fleming's Steak House from American Express. The coupon was for $40 off the total bill. The coupon could not be used for the early dining special offer. We arrived at 5:30pm and the place was reasonably full. The crowd looked fairly young and we surmised these folks were here for the low priced special. The others diners may have been corporate, dining on the boss's dime. The dining room is large and  brightly lit. Many of the tables are round booths inviting you to have a romantic dinner with your honey. Despite the small crowd and lighting, the room was fairly quiet making you feel as if you were enjoying an intimate experience.  When we were first seated a young man came by and asked if we wanted to start with the \"complimentary bread course\". Since when has bread become a course? They wanted you to know how lucky you were to get free bread these days. We jumped on the offer knowing that this was the last complimentary thing to come our way. The bread was a crusty French bread and was really quite good. We each ordered a glass of wine.  Our waitress was new. She was friendly and helpful. It was clear she was practicing a specific patter she was to use when describing options and menu items. I ordered a wedge salad with blue cheese dressing and a petite fillet. My friend had mashed potatoes with Parmesan and peppercorn and the bone-in rib eye. Both of our steaks were prepared perfectly, medium- rare just as we had ordered. The meat was flavorful and tasted even better cold the next day. The serving size was reasonable. The mashed potatoes could have been shared with three people and the wedge salad was also a generous serving. The potatoes were \"ok\".  To put the costs in perspective, I will tell you that a baked potato is $9.50. Despite that fact, we shared a slice of cheesecake which I thought was \"fine\". I had coffee, she had tea. I kicked myself for not asking for a second cup but truthfully I was too full to swallow another thing.  In the middle of the meal the manager came by to see how things were going. His affect was so over-the-top we were speechless, a cross between Guy Smiley and The Joker. Made us want to cringe. The whole experience seemed staged... bright lights, pretty props and actors with a script. We had a good time (we generally have a good time no matter where we are) but it sure was clear who benefited from the coupon... Fleming's. $150, really?"}
{"text":"Good food but it didn't dazzle us (which it should for this price). We also hated the iPad-driven ordering system, it struck us as a pretty cheap gimmick. I would much rather have the waiter tell me what's up rather than have them instruct me on how to use their iPad system. This computer-based ordering system made me feel like I was getting hosed on the service. I also felt like the space inside felt cavernous and cold.   If you need free parking in front of your fancy steakhouse, this might be the place for you. I'd rather go to the Tornado instead."}
{"text":"I have been to Flemings many times but not since I started Yelping so....my review!  I took my wife to Flemings for Valentines Day (we celebrated the night before since the Daytona 500 was on Sunday...HAHAHA) and we had an amazing dinner as we always have had at Flemings.  Yes, I know Flemings is a chain owned by the Outback Steakhouse corporation and the general Madison person looks down on chain restaurants but I want to tell them....go screw because this chain is good and you do not know what you are missing!  We were seated immediately when we arrived for our reservation and the staff was amazing.   Our waiter was exceptionally great as he never left us waiting or with our glasses empty.  5 stars for the service!  My wife starts out of the shrimp cocktail and I with the French Onion soup.  Both were fantastic.  The soup was delicious and just how I liked it.  For our entrees we both went with the special of the night (although we both had planned on something else) and it was two 4oz fillets wrapped in bacon along with two lobster tails.  The fillets were very good but mine was slightly overdone (I wanted Medium).  The lobster tails were delicious and were served with some sort of bisque to dip in.   We requested some drawn butter as the bisque was good but not what we liked with our lobster.  The butter was brought out immediately. So, out meal was great and besides the slightly overcooked steak (my fault as I know I should always order medium-rare at a restaurant) and we were very happy.  With our dinner I have a couple glasses of the Mick Fleetwood Cabernet Sauvignon and it was a great wine.   Pricey...yeah but thats what you get when you order wine at a restaurant.     Now we were full and happy but wanted to be more happy.  I have gained my wife's pregnancy cravings and we wanted desert!  They had a red velvet cake on special that caught my eye when we got there.  My wife went ahead an ordered it so I went with the cheesecake so we did not have the same thing and could share.  Bad choice on my part.  The cheesecake was good but a little dry.  The red velvet cake was AMAZING!   My poor wife hardly got any of it.  LOL  Overall Flemings is Flemings!   They have great steaks and great service!   Just like in the past, Flemings has my business over and over again.  I also love the fact that our exceptional waiter had his own business card so we can request him again!"}
{"text":"It was a busy graduation Saturday night.But that's no excuse for a drink put into a heavy glass with a lot of ice to make you think you're getting more than you are.. I know of no other expensive steak houses where (according to the manager), they have a 1 ounce pour.. In fairness, when I questioned it, our drinks were comped, Additionally,the mussels were overlooked and flavorless, And the other's meal's were not worth it. On the plus side,our server was well trained, attentive and competent, handling the drink issue by having the manager come to our table.  Not returning any time soon. MADISON has so many other really wonderful choices."}
{"text":"We came here for my wife's birthday. I had made reservations and we were actually sat upon arrival. Kate, the manager checked on us frequently and Beth our server was attentive. Exceptional service, exquisite food. This was our first time here and we were completely impressed and will keep coming back."}
{"text":"This is one of 5 steakhouses in Madison that I like. I don't usually rate chain restaurants, but this one is worth a try. I would put it slightly above Ruth's Chris in that category. The cuts of meat were top notch, and the wine selection, especially on the high end, was great. The wedge salad and calamari were excellent.   The night we went last was very busy, and the service seemed a little slow, but that has not been my experience the previous times I have eaten here. When it's busy, the atmosphere can be a bit noisier than other restaurants in this price range, and the fast moving team of waitstaff add to the busy feel."}
{"text":"Had an amazing brunch. Drinks were amazing, lost count of the mimosas. Food was super. Logan took great care of us. Everything was perfect. We will be back again for sure."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Marco was our server and he was amazing! Recommended wine and food. Had Filet mignon with peppercorn rub, burnside sauce, med rare. Mac and cheese delightful, spinach delish, mashed potatoes had truffle oil yumm, and mushrooms melted in your mouth. Had a great time."}
{"text":"Fabulous food they will accommodate you if your gluten free.  Tonight we had the burger no bun very yummy!! Service was a ten!!!"}
{"text":"Flemings was one of our favorite restaurants when we lived in LA.  So were were very excited discovering what Flemings LV has to offer.  We decided to check out Happy Hour  (between 4:30-7pm) at around 5:30 because its a madhouse at the bar.  Yes you will have to wait around and fight for decent seating but its well worth it.  We ordered:  Sweet Chili Calamari.  Love this different take on traditional calamari with  marinara sauce.  Its breaded and covered in sweet chili sauce that resembles thai sweet chili sauce.  Carpaccio.  Tasted great with the small pieces of toasted bread  Roasted Mushroom Ravioli.  This was my least favorite dish only because I am not a huge ravioli fan in general.  My wife liked he dish very much.  Creamy.  The $6 bacon burger.  Very tasty but a little bit on the salty side.  Washed it all down with Pinot Noir.  All very good.  We will definitely be back.  The price is right and the quality is very solid.  We also like the crowd which appears to be a little bit more on older side.  We appreciate the change in scenery and vibe."}
{"text":"Overall - Disappointed. The family and I were looking for a great dining experience. This was not the Flemings experience we have had in the past both in Madison, WI as well as San Diego, CA. Some of the staff was friendly and welcoming and others seemed unhappy to be working this evening. There was an odd atmosphere created by our server. We felt rushed at times and we were never offered additional drinks or wine after our bottle was gone halfway through the meal. I believe our server required additional training as she made the entire family feel as if she did not want to be at work on this Saturday evening. Perhaps something was troubling her and for that I feel terrible. Unfortunately, it spoiled our experience forcing us to leave only a 7% gratuity where normally Flemings staff deservingly earns over 20% from us. There were several mistakes made throughout the evening and rather than sitting and enjoying a second bottle of wine and more drinks, we chose to go elsewhere. Carl, the manager on duty politely came by to check on our experience, however we felt mentioning our disappointment at that time would have only further soured the evening. On a positive note, the steaks were cooked to perfection as usual and the food was hot and delicious. We dine at resturaunts like Flemings for the atmosphere, experience and the wonderful food and I am sad to say tonight, the Madison location let us down. Unfortunatly, that's enough to have our family searching for new fine dining locations in Madison."}
{"text":"nice atmosphere and good service. the steak not worth the price and the portionwas very small. side dishes were good but again way over priced..."}
{"text":"We celebrated our anniversary here. The service was amazing, so fast and on top of EVERYTHING! We got the Flemmings salad, flemmings potatoes, prime ribeye topped with lobster and caviar. Everything was perfect, no complaints, only praises. The bread was so soft and the butter's were delicious. We finished our meal with lava cakes. They sent us home with 4 handmade truffles. We will return, again and again."}
{"text":"So good the burrata is my favorite! The clover club and 2 for q bluemoons are so worth it. The bar atmosphere is really romantic or great for friends i always look forward for a night out at Flemings"}
{"text":"My husband and I celebrated out anniversary here last t week.  We started in the bar for happy hour (7 days/week!).  The bartenders were very friendly and made great drinks!!  We moved into the dining room for dinner.  Our server was \"OK.\"  Not bad, just not the quality of service that Fleming's usually delivers.  My steak was cooked perfectly, however, my husband's was well-done (ordered it medium).  he tried to work through it, but gave up after about 3-4 bites.  They were very gracious about making him a new steak and brought out fresh sides with his entree.  It was just disappointing that I ate by myself.... We didn't get to enjoy the dining experience together.  When it was all said and done, we had a nice night.  I would go back....."}
{"text":"The set menu for Valentine's Day 2014 was \"just okay\" but I get that it's difficult to pull something like that off cost-effectively. I wouldn't do it again to be honest but I will definitely give their full menu another shot. The appetizers at the bar that I tried a few months back were intriguing, as is the extensive wine list. Some yummy specialty drinks on offer here as well. The top rate service definitely makes this place feel special. Was here for a special occasion in late November and they gave me a box of truffles!"}
{"text":"OK, you know how I feel about chain restaurants and that whole evil blight thing. Well, this place was the exception.   I got an invitation from a friend of mine to try this place and though a bit skeptical, I accepted.  We had a reservation and this is the only reason I'm taking away a star. When we arrived for our 7:30 reservation time, we had to wait nearly 10 minutes to be seated. Somehow, I was under the impression that a reservation meant you got a seat,,, immediately. Oh well.  They seated us in what I thought was the best seat in the house, a round corner booth that was tucked nicely away from the rest of the crowd. The place was a bit noisy and this space lent iteself nicely to avoiding that.  Stellar performance by our server. He didn't miss the mark even once and he got a nice chunk of change for that one. Great wine selection too.  My salmon was cooked to perfection. I could have left the Teriyaki glaze behind though, since it's too much sugar in a meal that already left me feeling a bit more full than I like. I also had a very nice garden salad, but $8.50? Really? I'm not going to complain too much because it really was that good."}
{"text":"I know there are lot's of good Steakhouses around. What set Fleming's apart, was not only the great steaks, but the great service. We went there for our anniversary, and they made it a very special evening. All the staff was great. First, the hostess, told us it would only be a minute for our table to be ready. We went to the bar, ordered drinks, when the hostess arrived and said our table was ready, but to take our time and enjoy our drinks, no rush it was very nice.  When we finally got to our table, the service and food continued to be excellent, good recommendations and no charge for corkage, when they found out it was our anniversary."}
{"text":"Best free dinner I had!!! The food quality is great . They have a large selection of wines of you drink. The sides are family style . The petite filet mignon was great. I personally can't afford at least $50 for dinner for me... but it's a nice treat. I've heard for special occasions they have given gift cards for your next visit. Costco sells $100 gift cards for $79i think. Fancy place."}
{"text":"I'm so glad I chose this place for my boyfriend's birthday dinner, as they did not disappoint at any moment. Our server was one of the best servers I've ever had, I'm pretty sure his name was Brandon but my boyfriend thought it was Brendan. He was super knowledgeable on the menu, as well as personable and friendly. Anyways, we spilt a Caesar and a Filet Mignon, and my boy got the King Crab. We were amazed with every dish. The King Crab has caviar, and the Caesar had prosciutto. There were so many amazing flavors and everything came out extremely quick, considering how busy it was. They gave my boy a box of chocolates for his birthday and a $25 gift card, but most importantly stellar service and food. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Narrow window (only about two hours long) for the happy hour but man oh man is it worth it! Also a catchy name '5 for 6 till 7'  !!Cocktails!!  Tropical Martini  - Made with Malibu coconut rum this cocktail is a perfect summer drink. Tastes of malibu with pineapple and something else. Light on the boozie taste, on the sweet side and fruity. Even if it sounds like a girl drink i'll still order one after another.  Blood Orange Fizz  - Not something i'd order again in my own opinion. Tasted like grapefruit where you have a mix of sour and citrus bitter. It's how the drink is suppose to taste, i guess i just don't go with it. Also confused about the Fizz bit as there was no fizz.  !!Apps!!  Roasted Mushroom Ravioli - Completely agree with Anthony M who gave me his last Ravioli (comes in 3s). The sauce is just amazing. I mean WOW that sauce was good. if there were bread offered at the bar during happy hour i would have grabbed some and soaked up some of that sauce. Ravioli itself paired very nicely with the sauce. The thing that impressed me the most was the large coarse chunks of mushrooms in the ravioli. My expectation of ravioli is usually pasta on the outside with some kind of fancy named mixed mush on the inside. Not these bad boys.  Tenderloin Carpaccio  - The tenderloin was just so damn tender to the point where it just melts in your mouth. This carpaccio is styled a bit differently then i'm used to. The topping was a basil and red onion with capers...umm...salad i guess with what tasted like a mustard based aioli. The Carpaccios i'm used to usually have a garlic aioli and some sort of spring salad on top with some kind of shredded cheese. This one was also served with slices of garlic bread with some melted cheese on top. Another head scratchier was cheese like garnish on top of the basil. We all thought it was cheese but it turned out to be hard boiled egg. Live and learn eh?  !!Brrrraaaiiiinnnn...i mean Maaaaaiiinnnnnssss!!  All three of us got the Sunday Prime Rib dinner for 29.99. I agree with others out there who expressed the feeling of robbing this fine establishment of a three course meal. The prime rib was between 12-14 ounces of beefy goodness and you get a side as well. Pre-steak included your choices of salads and post-steak includes a dessert. I was expecting a fixed dessert seeing as I just got an amazing deal on the main course. No...let me say that again NO you can have ANY dessert on the menu! We got chocolate lava cakes served with ice cream!  And finally as a closing statement i ate the bowl of whipped cream on a dare...Don't do it....i don't recommend eating the whipped cream. You CAN i mean it's quality whipped cream...just...don't..."}
{"text":"Steak is good. Wine list decent. Ambiance is pleasant and well suited to business luncheons/dinners. I thought the muted TV showing live sports in one corner brought it down a notch but this is an American chain, after all. No draft beer but only bottled? Oh dear... that's an oversight."}
{"text":"Love this place! I come here quite regularly and always have to order the burger on hh. Honestly think it's my favorite burger in all of Vegas. The bar was just remodeled a few months ago and has twice the amount of space it did before and yet it still gets completely full on its busiest nights. The bartenders here are great. I can sit down and they automatically bring me my water and remember my food order as well. I have never had to ask for more water any time I've ever gone. They always stay on top of it. Also the lemon drop drink on hh is very good. Those bartenders sure do know how to make a mean cocktail if you are in the mood to drink you should definitely try it. Really has an excellent happy hour menu. Also you can order from the hh menu as long as you are in the bar area and there are tables in that area if you don't want to be seated at the bar."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner & was a little disappointed. The seafood platter was tasty, though the king crabs legs a little salty. Which made me a little nervous since I ordered king crabs legs as my entree. That said I was correct in my assessment of the situation. My crab legs were fishy and salty. Not great. My husband had a bone-in filet which was delicious but not as good as Del friscos.  The server was nice & attentive but when he asked why I had eaten less than half & didn't want to take the rest home he seemed to ignore the response.  All in all the meal was decent but I'd recommend Del Frisco's over Flemmings any day of the week."}
{"text":"PHENOMENAL!   We had our office Christmas party in their private dining room which exceeded all expectations! To begin we booked our event with Leslie which included picking the date and a beautiful custom menu. Her customer service is one that sets a standard beyond what is customary! She truly inspired our team in the way we speak with our patients. The entire event was completely organized and lovely.  The servers who took care of us were Rory and Scott both of which worked so hard and so quietly to take care of our every need. We even requested a table set up change and an entire team of people jumped straight to work to bring our vision to life. We never had an empty glass or were left waiting for the next course because Rory and Scott were on top of it. Their recommendations from the wine to the entrees were extremely helpful for our guests. We were impressed by David's service skills when he brought out many plates in such a classy manner!  I can still taste the delicious dinner which the cooks worked so hard on. We truly enjoyed our annual holiday party thanks to the great team work here at the Charleston Location. Honestly the best Christmas party we have had in years and that's truly saying something. If you need help booking your party ask for Leslie! If you are lucky enough to have Rory or Scott serve you know you will be taken care of. We even stayed well over their closing time as we were having so much fun and they politely allowed us to finish up. I cannot wait for my next visit! Thank you to everyone even the kind hostess who carried my present to our room for me."}
{"text":"There's a reason that I didn't rate five stars and it's not about the food. Allow me to lay out my experience tonight, which is thanksgiving by the way.  This is the first time my family (as long as I've been around) hasn't stayed home for thanksgiving. We decided to go to Flemings since they happened to be having a special thanksgiving dinner. Let's start off by saying: I am more then satisfied. This is one of the best thanksgiving meals I've ever had.  We start off by having your drinks-- I highly recommend the elderflower fizz for anyone who doesn't drink alcohol.  Next, the salad was amazing. The combination of the cherry tomatoes, the nuts, the cranberries, and the lemon vinaigrette. It was a beautiful explosion of flavor in my mouth and that was only the appetizer.  When we got dinner, it. Was. Amazing. We all ordered the thanksgiving dinner. You see, no one in our group was particularly fond of turkey, but my god was that an exception. It was moist and delicious-- it almost felt wrong eating it, that's how good it was. The green beans were crisp and flavorful, the cranberry sauce tart and not too sweet. The mashed potatoes were supposed to be sweet potatoes and were more like regular potatoes than anything. Still good though. And that stuffing! My god it was so good. I almost cried. Not really. But almost.  Here's the reason my review is lacking 1 star:  The service was odd. They seemed to have...overbooked and understaffed for this night. We made reservations almost a month in advance yet we had to wait almost half an hour. Then after dinner there was more waiting-- this time for dessert and the check. Also about half an hour of waiting.  But overall it was an amazing experience and I'd love to go back again! Thank you to our wonderful server, Jessica Kelly. (Such a sweetheart.)  TLDR; go. Just leave your house right now. And go. Please."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and service even by NYC standards.  Price point is high but you get what you pay for.  Would recommend this restaurant without hesitation.  Unparalleled in Madison.  Very attentive 5 star staff with consistent high grade service. Have been here at least 6 times in last 2 years and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"I was here with a large group. The service was excellent and accommodating.  The food was good. The wine list extensive and we enjoyed ourselves and recommend it to others."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner with family. In my opinion, this is way over priced. Food is so so. Had better fillet mignon at the capital chophouse. Oh, the mignon is served without anything else, no carbs, no vege. Just meat. The small plates are small and way over priced. I had better ahi tuna elsewhere. Wine menu choices are selected from an iPad, maybe that's why their good cost do much. Probably won't be returning anytime soon unless I have a gift card."}

Honestly, happy hour just got taken to a whole, new level.  Oh, and they give you complementary, delicious chips. Just don't get too full off them so you can actually enjoy your dishes."}
{"text":"They have THE BEST specials when it comes to prime rib and filet! Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I have tried to think if I would change anything, so far nothing comes to mind in the food area, the noise could be a little lower. It might have been the table of drunk businessmen that night though."}
{"text":"I've been to Fleming's in Madison 5 or 6 times now over the past 4 years, and I have to say that both their service and quality of food is consistently outstanding and among the best in Madison!  Food: Every steak I've had here always exceeds my expectations; it may be a bit pricier than other locations to get a steak at, but the value is worth it.  And compared to other \"steak houses\", the prices are comparable.  Even the 'non-steak' dinners are always excellent quality.  Service: The customer service you receive here across ALL employees is probably the best and most consistently great of any restaurant I've been to anywhere.  They don't overlook any detail.  I can't say enough about this.  Wine:  One of the best and most complete wine lists around.  Always get's top marks in Wine Spectator magazine as well.   I would always recommend Fleming's in Madison to anyone looking for a great restaurant experience."}
{"text":"We have been going to Fleming's for years and we have NEVER had a bad experience.  Starting from the wonderful girls that great you at the door, to the gracious and kind food runners, to the professional servers (our favorites are Rory and Monica), to Jackie, the managing partner...we always feel welcome and like we are a part of their family.  The food is always incredible and they are always willing to make dietary or taste changes for us with no problem.  In fact, when we bring our kids and they are not in the mood for steak, they have even gone next door to Carraba's to bring them a pizza.  That is what Fleming's is all about...always taking care of the customer.  We love this place so much!"}
{"text":"Flemings is a wonderful place to eat--great food and great service.  It is quite pricey so we do not go very often but when we do, there are absolutely no complaints."}
{"text":"I was there late Tuesday night. I ordered the 20 oz rib-eye, it was cooked to perfection. I had the cheesecake for desert and it was the lightest best tasting cheesecake I've ever had. It was a wonderful meal."}
{"text":"Have eaten here ton of times.    I can say when the managing partner is here things run better.    Overdone Halibut.   Kids Mac cheese with onions and spicy.   Drink order that took 20 minutes cause the waitress forgot.     If you ever order the lobster tails be prepared for 3-4 inch long tails.   Anyone seen our waitress.   Overall a bad night for a regular place we eat.  Honestly.  They will never admit it but the Steak is not the same quality as before.    Same crap u get at grocery"}
{"text":"At Fleming you are paying more for the atmosphere because with the prices they charge you would expect food so good you can't recall your own name. The portion size is also very small so if you're looking for a full meal then make a quick stop by McDonald because you probably won't find it here. Otherwise, the staff who serviced us at the time was average but can be a little annoying with the same old sales pitch of desert."}
{"text":"Honestly I love this restaurant.  It's more about the food.  It the professionalism that all of the staff exhibit that impresses me.  Starting from when walking into the door.  The young ladies that man the phone and takes people back to their seats are just wonderful.  All of them have a relaxing and kind demeanor which I like when first coming into a high end restaurant.  The two servers I have had there, Ray and Brendon (I know I am misspelling his name so sorry about that) were just great.  Jackie (manager) you are doing a awesome job hiring and training the right people to be in your establishment.  I will be back in 2016:)"}
{"text":"The location was easy to find and the complimentary valet was nice.  When we went inside the staff was very friendly as well.  After being seated we were greeted nicely and the waiter was very helpful in recommending certain items.  After all of that the food and wine we both great!  I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I haven't had anything bad here yet.  I visit this place once a year.  This year I went with a small plate and a couple of sides to share.  My protein was the Ahi Ahi, and it was fabulous.  The sides I chose, Chipotle Mac & Cheese and Asparagus.  Both were excellent and the Mac and Cheese wasn't very spicy at all.  There was nothing processed tasting on the Mac & Cheese (which seems to be a common thread when ordering out versus making your own).  It was rich and cheesy...oh and the noodle style they chose hung onto every cheesy saucy drip...yum!  The Asparagus was roasted to perfection.  The finishing touch was the berries and cream.  Such a fresh and celebrated taste, I couldn't have asked for more.  Just as a warning, you are paying higher end prices but you are also getting good service (at least I did) and excellent food."}
{"text":"Great patio and surprisingly busy bar area for a Wednesday night.    Arrived during their 5-7 happy hour for dinner and drinks.  We both ordered from the (discounted) bar menu and had burgers ($8), which were delicious and served with tasting rail thin french fries.    The brussel sprouts ($12) were also a hit, good but not over the moon, though I'm a bit of a brussel sprouts connoisseur and snob :-)       Staff was friendly and we seamlessly moved inside for a second glass of wine after our meal.  Very accommodating staff.  2 glasses of wine and dinner for two for $60.  Overall happy with the experience and would definitely go back.  Worth noting their steak menu is $40-$50+  and many of their small plates start around $20."}
{"text":"Nice food, stunning service,  my family and I we enjoyed the restaurant,  and we will be back . Good service from Bethany K .  Thanks for the good time."}
{"text":"Best steak I had in Vegas, came out perfectly cooked and very well seasoned!  Recommend you at least try their sauce they make!"}
{"text":"Warning friends, if you PARK valet or handicap, your car might get a dent on your fender from the Valet guy. Check your car out. Or carry lots of insurance, making dining even more expensive there.  I was parked in handicap and he dented my rear fender, but unfortunately I didn't catch him. Me, next time I will have to sit by the window and watch the car every second."}
{"text":"Shout out to Mat T. for being an awesome server! He was knowledgeable, accommodating, timely, personable, AND had a sense of humor.   My boyfriend and I went here on a whim for a date night on a Tuesday. We were a little caught off-guard by how fancy it really was (service-wise, especially). You can check your coat at the front desk, they will label your table by \"party name,\" and there's a fancy iPad-like device you can use to order all the wine you want. So overall experience--5 stars.  The food is where I'm taking a few stars away. Disclaimer: when I go out to eat, I expect the food to be something that I can't make at home, and something that I haven't had on just another day. The food at Fleming's is good, but it's predictable and over-priced. If you're into that, then I would definitely recommend it! To start, the bread and flavored butters were pretty awesome. A highlight of the meal. We also got the scallops, which were perfectly cooked--another highlight of the meal. (Though, they were very small.) The burrata salad was very underwhelming. There wasn't much flavor aside from tomato, greens, and milk. For our main course we ordered the dry-aged prime ribeye with an add-on of king crab. That combo was wonderful, but our steak was tough and over-cooked. For $68 (for the steak plus crab), I would have rather gone to Merchant or another restaurant. Finally, we ordered the lava cake. This takes about 20 minutes to bake, so if you're going to want it at the end of your meal then order it with your entrees. It was a very delicious, fun experience. I would recommend a bite with a little bit of everything in it.   So overall, a nice date night--we didn't have to cook! Service was great, but the food will break your bank."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give Fleming's 5 stars!  I had heard a lot about it and had my hopes set high.  We went here about a week ago to celebrate hubby's birthday and were excited to ingest red meat....happens once or twice a year at best.  The interior is lovely and dark, as befits a steakhouse.  We thought the tables were closer to each other than necessary; the overall effect was less intimate and more crowded.  Hmm.  Hostess was pleasant and perky as she guided us to a booth (yay!).  Our actual server was a little on the reserved side and could not be blamed for being overly solicitous at all.  (Someone else came to inquire how we liked our food.)  Yes, the food.  We each got a salad (Fleming's Salad and the Wedge Salad), and enjoyed them both very much.  I ordered the BBQ Scottish Salmon Fillet -- yeah, I know I said I was excited to eat a steak, but I also really really like salmon! -- and hubby got the NY Strip steak with a side of asparagus.  Both entrées were very good and proved that the kitchen knows what they're doing.  Sadly, we were both too stuffed for dessert.  My criticisms: the service.  I'm sure that many folks who have visited Fleming's have received excellent service and that's fantastic.  I'm just a little disappointed that our server was basically just doing her job: serving the food.  We mentioned right away that it was our first visit -- a tip for introducing house specials or suggesting wine pairings or just chatting about how awesome the food is -- but nada.  She seemed most animated when she brought us our bill.  (The gent who cleared our dishes after each course was smiley and happy, though!)  So, the thing I most remember about my first visit to Fleming's is the food, which is probably a good thing.  However, I had expected more skill and enthusiasm from our server, especially when I was paying a pretty penny for dinner."}
{"text":"This a great neighborhood steakhouse!  The service and food are always consistently good.  Plus sign up for Friends of Flemings and they give you little perks every so often, including gift certificates and free wine tastings!  Get a petite filet mignon, the Flemings potatoes and a glass of cabernet.  You'll be in heaven!  And try the mints on the way out.  They are yummy!"}
{"text":"Way over priced. French onion soup terrible. Steak was very good. Shrimp with it very average. Drinks way over priced."}
{"text":"I've been here several times. The decor is nice and the waitstaff was pretty attentive. I got the Summer price fixe menu-- I chose the chilled potato leek soup, the peppercorn crusted filet mignon, and for dessert the molten chocolate lava cake.   The potato leek soup was good and the chocolate lava cake was to die for. However, the filet mignon was overly seasoned (way too peppery and way too salty)-- it covered up the flavor of the steak even.  If you want a fantastic piece of steak, try some place else."}
{"text":"A big disappointment. My fiancèe and I had decided for a dinner at Fleming's on the day of their \"special Prime Rib soirèe. It was not our first time at Fleming's and we easily drive the ten miles from our hotel to this west side location.  We were met at our table by a nice looking waitress, whose beautiful smile seemed to be able to turn on and off quite easily. We ordered a drink, two glasses of wine and asked for the prime rib dinner. Our choice of salad arrived, and the Caesar's was smothered in garlic...I thought for a moment I was in one of those \"italian\" american restaurant where garlic seems to be everywhere (But you still think italians go around smelling of garlic? Come on, your are lost in a time warp). The entrees arrived after some waiting. \"Is this prime rib?\" I asked. \"No\", answered miss cold smile, \"It clearly isn't. Just we finished prime rib, so we broght you a steak\". Ah... Then she said something about this being a bargain for us, getting the steak at the same special price of prime rib special...WOW...I fly from Roma to Vegas 2 or 3 times a year for business and leisure and we gladly spend some money in this wonderful city, indulging in shows, shopping and fine dining...Saving 10 bucks and not having what we liked was NOT a bargain. The steak was good, however literally covered in black pepper. But why? With such decent meet you do not need to go over the top with unhealthy dressing. It took some time to brush the pepper off the steak, by then it was cold. We had an excellent crème brulè at the end.  All in all, I will not be back. Pity for that charming smile, but I'll stick to good old timer Delmonico or SW Steakhouse next time. Maybe CUT at the Palazzo, which I really want to try. More expensive than Fleming's, but probably more professional."}
{"text":"I am giving three stars because the service was great. The food on the other hand... disappointing. I ordered the petite filet and my fiancé orders the most expensive steak on the menu. Both were flavorless. I am not one to complain (especially on my birthday/Valentine's Day) so I ate about half the steak. The very nice waitress could tell I wasn't loving it and offered to get me a new steak. I declined simply because I felt it would be replaced with the same quality steak. The manager comped my meal which was very nice. BUT this morning I woke up with a very unhappy stomach.   I will not be returning. I appreciate the service but the quality did not match up with the price point."}
{"text":"My boyfriend was here from Ohio on an extended visit and was craving a good steak. It was kind of last minute so a reservation at my preferred steakhouse (Smith & Wollensky's on the Strip) was not going to happen. I looked up steakhouses here on yelp and found Flemmings. I was happy to make my reservation here online and looked forward to dinner.The bone in rib eyes were good but the dry aging at S&W is hard to compare to and so far, everyone has failed. The company I was keeping made the dinner one I will remember and the meal was very good as well. If I can't get into S&W again, I will be back."}
{"text":"Wonderful service and pretty good food.  We went on a Friday night and the restaurant was busy but not annoyingly so.  We ordered drinks at the bar and were seating pretty quickly after that.    We ordered the Chopped Salad, which I recommend, and the Mozzarella and Sweet Tomato salad, which was a little too sweet (though I'd clearly been warned).  The Filet was excellent, the lamb chops were okay.  The Fleming's potatoes were just potatoes au gratin with jalapenos, which I couldn't taste.  Kinda meh.  We ordered the chocolate lava cake for dessert which was amazing.  Overall, this place has my recommendation.  They have a pretty good wine selection as well."}
{"text":"Let me first by saying:   If you are having a bad day and don't feel like being at work, but work with the general public you should probably not come to work. Or at the very least check your troubles at the door.    That being said, my first experience at Flemings was terrible! Aside from the food being mediocre (Mastros is much better) Our server seemed extremely bothered when he was asked questions about the menu. After bringing out the wrong drink, and wrong side times. We thought we were in the clear. That was until the bill came. We split the bill by seat using two cards and $120 cash. Our server took it upon himself to charge majority of the bill to one card ($145) put another portion of the bill on another card ($50), use $60 of the $120 cash towards the bill and pocketed the rest as a tip! Had we not of looked over the bill before leaving he would've received a $170 (we were already planning to tip $60 on top of the $50 tip he had already received.) tip and one person would've wound up paying for 4 other people's meals. When we pointed out that the check was wrong he proceed to throw money on the table and tell us he didn't care & walked away. Luckily Kate the manager figured everything out and got every thing squared away."}
{"text":"I feel bad writing this review but I was underwhelmed by my dinner at Flemings. I haven't been in years but I used to think of Flemings as a more upscale steakhouse but after last nights dinner I feel like it's a common steakhouse with expensive price tags.  The good: filet mignon was tender and delicious. The Flemings potatoes and creamed corn were so delicious but super salty. The desserts were yummy.  The blah: the lobster was very fishy tasting   The Flemings salad was a messy plate of lettuce with sloppy toppings thrown on top. I felt like someone made this salad off a salad bar with an odd ratio of tomatoes and other toppings to the lettuce.  The shrimp appetizer was super disappointing. I thought the shrimp were flavorless.  The bread was a loaf of boring bread that was a little overtoasted and stale.  Service was fine; no complaints but nothing stood out.  With so many other fine dining options in Summerlin, I can't think of a reason why I would come back to Flemings."}
{"text":"Flemings has it all - a great and high-value happy hour, and dinner service befitting a higher end steakhouse - happy hour burger and drink specials are a fantastic value and high-quality, and dinner items, albeit an indulgence, are well prepared and thoughtfully presented.  Nice touches abound, such as chocolate covered strawberries presented for special occasions and other such niceties.  No peccadillos here!!!"}
{"text":"Had a group and Great Happy Hour & Service. Unfortunately several ordered the $50 RibEye and extremely dissapointing. Thin Cut, over cooked and slathered in we think butter? Could'nt understand why the steaks where so poor quality. Person in the group equated them to a much lesser quality restaurant. It became obvious to us afterword why the bar area was so busy and no one in the dinning room. Stick with the Great Happy Hour only which by itself get 4 to 5 stars."}
{"text":"I really think there is this phenomenon where when someone pays exorbitant prices for something, that they automatically think it's better than something less expensive. Dyson vacuums are an example. Mine seriously doesn't clean any better than my $80 Bissell, but people SWEAR by these things either to make themselves feel better for spending $500 on a vacuum or because they just think that it must be better because of the price. It's like a consumers placebo effect. I think Fleming's falls into this category for sure.  My parents wanted to go out for their anniversary and my dad chose this place because someone had recommended it to him. My mom called and made reservations and told them it was for an anniversary. When we arrived we were greeted  promptly and seated immediately which was nice. The first thing I noticed was a stench of sewage. The bar was under construction so maybe it had something to do with that. Since my parents had chosen the place I didn't want to say anything, but had it not been for that, the smell would have made me walk out immediately. After we had sat down, both of my parents mentioned the smell also. The hostess wished my parents a happy anniversary and presented them with an anniversary card. The waiter came over and things started off pretty well with him. He seemed quick and attentive. My dad ordered a calamari appetizer which was moist and mushy. My dad ate most of it, but I couldn't stomach it.   My dad and I both decided on the filet mignon while my mom chose the salmon. The prices here are HIGH- which wouldn't be so bad if you were getting a lot of quality or even some quantity but I found that neither was really there. Our entrees averaged over $50 and did not include anything other than the meat- no veggie or even a sprig of parsley. I wanted a baked potato with my meal and a baked potato side cost $10.50! Seriously?! A 10 cent potato for $10.50?! I went ahead and ordered it because I couldn't imagine having just a slab of meat with nothing else. The $10 potato tasted like it was baked yesterday and then microwaved or re-warmed today. The filet was cooked nicely although lacked much in the way of flavor. I tried one of the sauces that went with it and it was sickly sweet and pretty nasty. Our service went downhill considerably once the food was placed on our table. Our server stopped by about 2 minutes after the food was put down and then we never saw him again. We finished our meal, a busser brought my dad a box for his leftovers and we waited for the server to come back with the check. And we waited......and waited.....and we waited some more. He never came. Eventually my dad grew impatient and wanted to leave so we went to the hostess station to get the bill. Even she couldn't find our server. There were no anniversary extras like some other reviews got- no dessert or anything like that. Not even a \"see ya\" from our waiter.  For comparisons sake, my preferred restaurant for tonight would have been Kona Grill, not too far from here. Usually when I go there I order the filet. The filet at Kona is the same size as the one I got here and tastes virtually the same. The only difference I would say is that Fleming's maybe has more of seared taste which in my opinion is neither good or bad. I could take it or leave it. At Kona your filet comes with garlic mashed potatoes and a veggie side and is topped with sauteed mushrooms. It costs $29. I usually order some California rolls as an appetizer for $6.95. For the same price as one piece of meat here at Fleming's I could have gotten the filet MEAL (not just a piece of meat) and THREE orders of California rolls at Kona- and there would be virtually no difference in quality.   Lastly, the atmosphere here is more reminiscent to the \"fancy\" restaurants of the late 80's or early 90's. It's really loud, really dark, and not very appealing. Aside from the smell of sewage which also smelled like they were trying to cover it with the smell of patchouli oil, the hostess kept walking back and forth by the food line hacking her head off like a tuberculosis patient. The crowd in the restaurant was mostly 70+ . There were a lot of oxygen tanks, walkers, and canes in there. Definitely not a spot for someone younger. I think aside from the staff I was probably the youngest person in there at 33."}
{"text":"This steakhouse is amazing! The food is always great and the staff is awesome!! They did a remodel a few months ago and it looks wonderful!!! I will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Great service, atmosphere and food except for the the so called King Crap legs. I was expecting huge legs sliced in half for easy access to the meat but got 5 maybe 6 legs on the smaller side that we difficult to eat. But but still had a great time with my family."}
{"text":"Got what we came for, a burger and a nice glass of wine. Great atmosphere. Just had higher expectations for their burger coming from such a nice steakhouse.  It was fine but not great..but good enough to go back."}
{"text":"This weekend they are having a Steak and Lobster dinner for $50. This was an incredible deal! The girls who greeted us at the reception desk could not have been sweeter.  The first course salad was terrific. Pick Caesar or Seasonal. We had one of each. Both were delish. Then the steak and lobster. A heated butter dish was brought before the entree to heat the lobster butter. Both the steak and lobster were perfectly done. One of the best filets I've had. The lobster was very good. We couldn't even finish it. Then we had our choice of any dessert. The warm lava cake is ordered ahead. It comes with raspberries and 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream and little crispy wafers. The turtle pie is my favorite. It's served warm on a splash of caramel with Chantilly whipped cream on the side.  The food was wonderful but our server, Schuyler was the Best!! Pretty much perfect. I hope Fleming's realizes what a gem they have here!"}
{"text":"Amazing experience. Malcolm was an amazing server and took great care of us. If you have the chance, be sure to visit Flemings in Madison!"}
{"text":"Flemings was a nightmare on Mothers Day! The restaurant was super crowded as can be expected, but the seemed ill prepared to deal with it. At one point a fist fight almost broke out in the lobby when customers with reservations began to get upset after waiting over an hour. We had reservations at 6 pm and we were seated relatively quickly however, we waited over an hour after ordering for our food!! This is probably why there were so many issues with the lobby for people who arrived at 7pm. When our food arrived, my husbands \"special\" bone-in filet was charred to a crisp on the exterior and not at all appetizing. We took a picture. So, after spending almost $500 for four and several hours waiting, we were deeply dissatisfied and didn't even opt for desert. The manager was nowhere to be found....probably dealing with the brawl in the lobby. I will NOT return to Flemings. What is the point when there are so many world class steak houses in Vegas."}
{"text":"The food was great very delicious ! A lil pricey definitely not a place id go on a regular more like special occasions I highley recommend the macaroni and cheese and the Burgers definitely a must. The french fries are not really that great very greasy and bland other than that Flemmings is definitely a top spot to dine in at anytime if you are a steak lover the aged prime rib is to die for."}
{"text":"This is a very bittersweet 5 stars for me.  There happy hour is from 5-7pm every day.  They have a burger at the bar that is $6 dollars at this hour!  This is by FAR one of the best burgers I have ever had.  I cannot stress this enough!!    Even though the prices are so cheap at happy hour, the service is still great.  It's a cool dark atmosphere in the bar area.  My one issue though is that lately, the past 3 times I have been there, it is hard to get a table.  But what can I expect for such amazing prices for such good food?  Anyway, the last 2 times we couldn't even get a table, but I still give it 5 stars.  My advice is to get there early.  I hate writing reviews at this hour, I get so hungry."}
{"text":"We just had an amazing dinner! We go to Flemings a few times a year but tonight we really wanted a great steak! My husband said \"Flemings!\" We didn't have a reservation but they were able to seat us very fast. All the staff is amazing, from the host to the servers, bussers, and even the manager stopped to check on us! Amazing customer service!! Our server Adam went above and beyond to make our date night special! He suggested wine and it was just perfect! Thank you Adam! :)"}
{"text":"This visit was for the Sunday brunch, and I enjoyed everything about it. We were pleasantly greeted by the hostess and our server was friendly and efficient. A complimentary mimosa was a great way to start, and all that followed was really good. At brunch they serve biscuits instead of bread and I wish they offered the biscuits at dinner, too, because they are delicious. We enjoyed sea bass and a salad with salmon and had a nice dessert. It wasn't what I normally think of eating for brunch, but I enjoyed it a lot."}
{"text":"If you want to relax and not feel the least bit rushed this is the place to go. Love the atmosphere, dim light big city dining. I was pleased to see people casually dressed but of course this is Wisconsin:).  The staff was friendly and very attentive. One thing I love to see is team work and that they have. Our waiter Adam made us feel comfortable and his helper was very nice. They are professional and seem experienced.  I and my friend had the Sunday night prime rib special. For 39.95 each we had a 3 course meal. Lg salad fresh and delicious, prime rib cooked perfectly. You choose 1 side. I had the Flemings potatoe which was a huge portion of like scalloped potatoes with peppers in a creamy sauce toped with melted cheese super good! For desert you could choose any desert off their menue. I had cheesecake with fresh Berrys and my friend had carrot cake both delicious. We took half our food home there was so much.  We will be going back and I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Awesome wine list and service.  Great date night.  They have a private back  room for parties. Try their chocolate lava cake for dessert, must order 20 mins in advance."}
{"text":"Had our anniversary dinner here. While waiting to be seated, listened to an angry customer rant to the staff about his horrible dining experience there. We certainly didn't experience that! I had a ribeye with the diablo shrimp and a Caesar salad, all were excellent. My wife had the small plate sliced filet over risotto and onion rings and said it was delicious. The staff was very attentive. I thought the overall experience was good but pretty steep prices."}
{"text":"We come here a lot because.... one they have a great Happy Hour but they're happy hour hamburger has horrible cold french fries they're more like Potato Sticks. After telling the server we really like hot french fries. The food Runner served our meal and they were ice cold there was five of us at the table I asked her to bring us another order  but this time hot they took the french fries and double dip them in the grease and they came back like Potato Sticks. It was not her fault she was overwhelmed because it was too many customers... she did offer or something else a dessert at the end which we took but Fleming's really needs to get rid of these french fries and go back to the hand cut once they used to have. It still is the best Happy Hour in town. Like I said I come here a lot and that's my only issue and they have more french fries going back the food Runner seems to be pissed off because he has to do double work."}
{"text":"We love this local Summerlin steakhouse, food is always consistent and service was great. We had a young  African American gentlemen, who went above and beyond!! We ordered a bottle of wine we they recommended and it was fantastic. Reservations are pretty easy to get. We love flemings!"}
{"text":"Just ordered takeout mushroom ravioli and it was delicioussss, super friendly and super high quality food"}
{"text":"The food is great we did a rib eye & a sirloin pretty basic cuts, both were done correctly. The mushroom ravioli appetizer is special, the tuna as well...The decor is nice and makes this place a nice one for 'special' dinners. As others have mentioned it is pricey with a good tip for good service we were at $185 for two appetizers, two sides, two steaks and one glass of wine... hummm...."}
{"text":"My husband and I used to be regulars at this Flemming's meaning we would go there at least 2 times a month. Then Roy's closed and they moved staff from Roy's to Flemming's. Then the new Flemming's opened and we tried that one. We went to Flemming's in Summerlin tonight for their filet fall special. To say we were disappointed is an understatment. The salad was wilted and unseasoned, the filet tasted like dry pot roast and the carrots had no flavor what so ever other than the pepper sprinkled on them. The only thing that was at all good was the desert. Since we are on their mailing list for birthdays and anniversaries we got an email saying we could have a free desert for my birthday this month and our anniversary also this month. We got a mini box of chocolates. All for $189. Thanks but no thanks. My husband loved going to this place for the good food and good service. No more as of tonight we will not be going back."}
{"text":"Went to this uppity steak restaurant expecting great things, and was only moderately satisfied.  The place is very nice.  The atmosphere is easily that of a first date or an anniversary date.  The service was top notch and very friendly.  Now onto the food and drink!  I ordered the beef medallion dinner special, which came with a salad and dessert for around $40.  Great price, that much is for sure.  The salad was really nice.  Fresh spinach with a very flavorful vinaigrette that I just couldn't get enough of.  It tasted like it was sauteed in mushrooms or something.  The medallions were good, but overly cooked (I ordered medium rare), and a bit dry.  I suppose this cut of meat tends to be dry, but it just was a little bit of a let down.  I tasted my friend's rib eye (medium rare), and it was perfect.  It melted in my mouth, and was delicious!  I only wish my medallions were as good.  The dessert was nice as well.  I went with a bread pudding.  As far as bread puddings go, it was tasty, but nothing mind blowing.  Overall for food, I give this place 4 stars.  Why for the three stars?  Well, the wine list is pretty extensive.  Three or four pages on the menu make up the wine list.  That is great and everything, but the restaurant's website and menu also advertises that it has \"craft beer and local beer.\"  I was really looking forward to a good IPA with my steak.  Let me tell you what \"craft beer\" means to Fleming's because they didn't have any local beer, and the waitress made it sound like they won't in the future.  They offer Redhook IPA, Boston Lager, Widmer's crappy Hef, and Bluemoon.  Really?  This is blatant false advertising as far as I am concerned.  The owners/managers need to take a trip to Stone Brewery and learn what craft beer is.  If that is too foreign of a market, take a trip over to Yard House at least!  Get with the program, Fleming's!"}
{"text":"The Happy Hour!   Jumbo Shrimp Cocktails are good on the stomach after night of drinking.  Seared Ahi Tuna, Didn't know exactly what is was even when the bartender (cutie gurl) was explaining it to me... the Tropical Martini was so strong!!  But yeah when I got it I was little upset, my fault though. Its raw tuna and just the outside is cooked. I saw this brown circle of cooked fish and a middle of red ruby raw fish. I was like ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh I have to eat this. The bartender got little nervous when she saw my face so I quickly tried to look hungry and ate it. I didnt want the Prime Burger cuz my neighbors plate had it and it looked like an AM PM mini burger or those costco mini burger bites.  But highly recommend it, not a lot of tourists mostly for locals and good grub for your buck!!!"}
{"text":"Such a great place to splurge. The food and service was excellent.  I took advantage of their prime rib deal and was so happy I did, started with the Flemings salad, my prime rib was tender and juicy as well as a big portion,  loaded baked potato delicious and lava cake done to perfection.  My husband hot the dry aged steak, cooked perfectly medium so juicy and flavorful with asparagus as his side which was very well done. We had a lovely experience,  we will definitely return."}
{"text":"The best bartenders ....absolutely amazing drinks you can't get better !!!!Ryan and Kim are the nicest most courteous bartenders I've ever dealt with in all of this town. They know exactly and cater to what you want and have the best customer service out of any bartender I know of . !!! I had 3 blueberry lemon drops which were out of this world you couldn't even taste the alcohol but they did the job !!!!"}
{"text":"My parents rarely take themselves out & I'm grateful to have the chance to treat them to a nice outing whenever I can. I was planning on taking my Father out to dinner at Wicked Spoon for Father's Day, but by the time he got off work that place would be closed. Since I took off work, I thought Fleming's would be the next best thing to try without worrying about the time. I took the last reservation at 9p.m. & we were promptly seated upon arrival. The hostess was welcoming, asked how I'm doing and how my day was, which was a pleasant to hear. She also informed me who's my server & wished us both to have a nice dinner & actually wished my Father.. & Happy Father's Day to you sir. My Father lit up & said.. Thank you thank you. That sure brought a smile on his face and to witness that.. brought a smile to mine. Great job to this hostess!!!  It took a few moments for our server, Sarah to greet us & by that time, we were already ready to order. We, both decided to get their Prime Rib Dinner. It comes with a choice of salad, one side, & one dessert. Like Father, like Daughter.. we ordered everything the same...   Fleming's Salad - Not spectacular or anything to rave about. There were too much sliced purple onions, which I had to put aside. The dried cranberries, croutons, & tomatoes were just okay. Extremely simple & looked cheap. The candied walnuts were overly covered with rock hard caramel, that I warned my Father to watch out in consuming it. You could literally hear me crack the candied part in my mouth & it wasn't a good feeling against my teeth. The best part... the dressing was tangy & fresh. The presentation itself wasn't appealing at all.   Baked Potato (Fully Loaded) - As the side we chose... It was the Best in our entire meal. My Father noted that it was his first time ever seeing such an enormous size potato & all its fixins. It came exactly in this order of toppings on the baked potato.. sour cream, butter, green onions, bacon & cheddar cheese as being a happy surprise in the very end as you dig inside. We enjoyed this Very much & it was one of the most flavorful fully loaded baked potato I ever tasted. Each bite I couldn't believe how delicious it was. Every topping complimented one another & it was like a joy ride of warm gooey goodness in its highest form. I can't tell you enough how much I love this side.. If I can give 5 stars alone to one food item I tasted here... this would definitely be it. Even my Father goes.. this Prime Rib isn't the best, but... this Baked Potato is!  Prime Rib - It comes with three sauces on the side, which consists of spicy mustard, horseradish, & au jus. I felt the au jus was too heavy in flavor & one bite with this sauce was overpowering the natural flavors of the meat. I did enjoy mixing the spicy mustard, which wasn't spicy at all, where you get any heat.. with the horseradish sauce, which was also very light like sour cream taste to it. The combination of these two sauces went great with the Prime Rib. I ordered mine Medium & it was cooked perfectly. My favorite part, the dark ends were in depth with flavor & I loved the tenderness of the meat. Overall, I thought this was an excellent entree. I would definitely order this again.  Dessert time! You have to order their signature sweet.. Chocolate Lava Cake. We both learned the hard way.. you can easily be completely full & satisfied with one order.. easy. It comes with a thin cookie-like holder with two generous scoops of vanilla ice cream inside & topped with chopped pistachio nuts. Next to it, is the rich chocolate cake with a molten chocolate center of belgian warm chocolate. Baked to order, which takes 20 mins. to make. One of my favorite desserts. It also comes with a side of Chantilly Cream, which is the next best thing to sliced bread! So freshly whipped, light, & tastes like a whipped vanilla bean ice cream. SOOOOO soooooo GOOD! Every bite I took.. I added this cream with my cake. Heavenly!!! I am known to finishing all my meals, but I could only eat half this portion. When the server first presents this dessert to you, you'll just be amazing how much you get. It's like a whole meal... dessert style. Then sugar coma sets in & you have to reevaluate your desire to finish it all or throw in the towel. I... threw in the towel & rested my head back. Waaaaay too much for lil ole me. Even my heart was racing!   Three mishaps, wanted to take our leftovers home, but the runner threw away half my dinner... Damn it! I love that Baked Potato!!! Oh well... Next time I want the to-go containers & bag it myself. Second, having to wait for a long time for our entrees to come out. Felt rushed. Third, being charged for both sides ($17) when it's included in the Prime Rib Dinner. I didn't catch it at first, but caught it after tallying 20% tip & giving my signature. You would think if I ordered that special, you would know not to charge the sides right?! Hmm honest mistake?! As another Yelper noted.. no such thing."}
{"text":"C'est la 1ère fois que je dinais à Fleming's et ça fait pourtant 10 ans que j'habite Summerlin. J'avais bien entendu parlé de cette endroit réputé pour la qualité de sa viande. Je n'ai pas été déçu. Le Petite Filet Mignon était délicieux et cuit à la perfection. J'ai aussi beaucoup apprécié le gratin de pommes de terre. Je trouve juste dommage d'être obligé de payer pour l'accompagnement. Sinon l'endroit est agréable et le service est top du top. Je regrette juste que l'addition soit un peu salée mais je le savais avant d'aller diner là-bas. Au final très sympa pour un diner romantique en amoureux."}
{"text":"came here with my family on my birthday. called ahead to make a reservation and they even called back few hours ahead to confirm reservation. the place was not packed when we were there and the ambience is clean nice and classy. the server was very friendly and made sure we had everything we need. we didnt wait too long for our food and the steak was one of the best if not the best i ever had in town. its not a cheap place for sure, but you get what you pay for. overall love the place and will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This is part of a chain of luxe steakhouses ala your Morton's, your Smiths and Wollenskys, etc. My mother had two birthday dinners this year for family reasons, and this was the first one. I think it was 11/04, for those of you date-obsessed Yelpers.  Anyway. We blew a 300+ dollar bill here on a party of six because there was a lot of drinking. Teenaged brother had the mushroom ravioli (okay), dad had the dover sole (really good, excellent saucier work.) The rest of us had steak except for brother-in-law, who had the pork, because brother-in-law is a gentile fool. His pork looked seriously undercooked and rather than complain, he didn't eat most of it. Which is seriously fail at 30+ bucks an entree ala carte, but whatever.  Drink review: everyone else ordered off the cocktails menu. I had a sip of some, most notably my sister's mango thing. It was smooth but the vanilla was an odd choice for a flavor dash. I had a dirty martini with gin. It was solid except for the fact that they didn't actually put enough olive juice in it, so they brought me a little carafe of olive juice for me to self-prepare. Which is really excellent service and fail bartending.   Anyway. It's solid and in the neighborhood but for the price you could ALSO go somewhere like Cut or Craftsteak or Prime and really blow some minds."}
{"text":"Flemings is a steakhouse chain similar to Ruth's Chris, so if you've been to one, you have a good idea of what to expect from the other; it's a high-end steakhouse where the steaks are big and served individually on very hot plates.  Side dishes are ordered separately and usually serve 2-3 people depending on how hungry everyone is, and the wine selection is top notch.    The menu changes somewhat with the seasons, particularly the dessert menu, but all the things you expect to be on the menu will be there.  This is not a place most people will go to on a regular basis; it's a place you go when you want to splurge a bit, since you'll probably be spending at least $50 a head.  But if you're going to splurge, this is as good a place as any to do it.  Steakhouses may have become sort of old hat in the last decade or so, but sometimes, you just want a really good steak."}
{"text":"I used to live in Vegas, and this was the hang out of my husband and I ( when were dating pre baby) Great wine list, the food was very good as well. I've been to the Flemmings in Los Angeles as well, but this place tops it with its service. One thing I do notice is that everytime you see a Flemmings, there's a 90% chance that next door you will see a Roys, I thought that was a funny coincidence.  I've seen a Flemmings and Roy restuarant side by side, in Las Vegas location, Newport Beach Location, The Valley location."}
{"text":"In my opinion, the best traditional steakhouse in the valley. The atmosphere is very nice, makes you want to eat steak lol. The place looks like a high class steakhouse abd that's exactly what it is, but the service makes you feel like you are an old friend. Stone of the nicest servers in the city in my opinion. As for the food, only one word to describe it: perfect. Every cut, perfect. Every side dish, amazing. Nothing more can be said about this place. I'd recommend it to any of my friends. And no, I do not work here, I just effing love steak and this place lol."}
{"text":"Ordered the 12oz Filet Mignon at $49.00 and was very dry. I have to say it's Not the best & not impressed. Now the Fleming's Potato side at $12.00 was good. Probably the best here is their Onion butter served with as the waiter said \"complimentary bread\". I've been to hundreds of restaurants with \"complimentary bread\" yet none had to say it.  Hmmm. The service was sub parr as I would expect a higher level for this scale of establishments. Spent over an hour here and asked only twice did they ask if I needed anything and 1 of those was me needing a tea refill. Maybe being the ONLY Hispanic in this place among older white guest could account for this."}
{"text":"Our most favorite restaurant to go for a nice prime rib dinner. Only on Sunday's. Dinner comes with salad, side dish prime rib and dessert."}
{"text":"Went to Fleming's after a failed attempt at T-Bones. (They lost our confirmed reservation and ran out of Prime Rib and Rib-eyes at 7:30 in the evening so we left!!) as we were celebrating our daughter's college graduation. Back to Fleming's. We were seated promptly and Rory took our drink orders and gave us our menu's. We ordered a bottle of nice wine to toast our daughter's achievement. It was served promptly. My wife and I ordered the short ribs and my daughter and her boyfriend ordered the 16oz. dry aged Rib-eye. My other daughter ordered the petite filet. We also ordered community vegetables Fleming's potatoes, creamed spinach and mushrooms. Everything was served in a timely manner and everything was cooked to perfection and was mouth-watering delicious!! When the manager (Jackie) heard that it was my daughter's graduation dinner, she comped dessert for 5 of us (chocolate lava cake, ice cream, blueberry cheesecake and carrot cake). Each one was better than the other. Jackie and Rory also presented my daughter with a $25.00  Fleming's gift card and a box of nicely wrapped truffles. This place is the absolute best place for dinner and steaks!!. My wife and I go here for happy hour occasionally and it has the best appetizers and drink menus in all of Las Vegas!! Thank You Jackie and Rory for a perfect evening!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I recently dined here and greatly enjoyed Fleming's The waiter was helpful, pleasant, and treated us with much respect. (We are younger than many of the frequent diners at Fleming's). The food was absolutely delicious! Overall, it was a wonderful experience and highly recommend this restaurant! I also loved the iPad they give you with the app that has information about the wine collection and wine pairings."}
{"text":"Fleming's was a disappointment.  It's priced as a high end steak house, but it doesn't measure up to many of the other high end steak houses around town.  Service:  Our server, Monica, was very nice; but she seemed to be overwhelmed by having too many tables.  Drinks and food were slow in coming, and I received a medium filet rather than the medium-rare rib eye  I had ordered.  When I pointed it out Monica comp'd our dessert, which was nice but still...  Food:  My accidental filet had a nice sear but was a little mealy.  My starter of shrimp and scallops on grits was pretty flavorful, but the shrimp were a bit overcooked.   My wife liked her Chilean Sea Bass and her starter of wedge salad.  We shared a side of the House potatoes, which were excellent.  All in all, the food was good but not great, and not justifying the high prices.  The meal described above, with two rounds of drinks/wine, came to well over $200.  Ambiance:  Nothing terrible, but not to my taste.  A very plain room with tables packed in pretty tight.  Fortunately, the area where we were seated was pretty empty on a Wednesday night, but other parts of the restaurant were crowded and loud.  Odds and ends:  Parking was a little bit dicey for an off-strip location in the 'burbs, but we lucked out and found a convenient space.  Much easier than the strip, of course, and the crowded parking lot does illustrate that Fleming's is popular with the locals.  Drinks were a little skimpy, but the prices were not too bad.  The bread basket was a small loaf of French bread, but was served with two very nice cheese spreads instead of butter, which we enjoyed.  A little creativity never hurts.  All things considered, we don't regret dining at Fleming's but we probably won't be back.  If you want a good steak on the West Side, I would suggest SC Steak at the Suncoast, a couple of miles away.  Better food, lower prices, and nicer ambiance, in my opinion.  Oh, yeah, and much faster service."}
{"text":"Still consistent! We came here Thursday night for dinner and Sunday for Easter brunch. Service is still top notch.  Jennifer was our server both times and we love how she remembers us!  Easy going with great service and consistently delicious food!  Nothing is worse than having a great experience one time and returning and having a terrible experience the next. This is NEVER the case at flemings... always great!  From Easter Sunday brunch to thanksgiving dinner to happy hour or even a dinner during the week we always walk away satisfied and excited to return.  Keep it up flemings!"}
{"text":"Delicious!!!  I ordered the Filet mignon, potatoes, and mac.... cleared my plate within minutes.  btw, the french onion soup is AMAZING!!!  The service here was great too."}
{"text":"I came here for a holiday party for work around Christmastime. Our experience was definitely very nice! I LOVE the decor at this place. It's so cozy and upscale. The service was very good, both at the bar and at the table. Of course, I'm sure they realized we were a big party with an unlimited budget, so that's somewhat subjective.   In terms of food, it was good. Not amazing, but very good. I've been to a few steakhouses now, and this didn't stand out necessarily to me. I did enjoy their wedge salad and garlic mashed potatoes, but my filet mignon was nothing special. I felt the meat was a little rough for medium-done, but I ate it (all!) nonetheless. As I am a college student it's rare when I get to eat a delicious meal like this, so I obviously enjoyed it.  Is the food good? Yes. Is it worth the money? Probably, but you could also go to Tornado or Johnny Delmonico's for a similar experience.   For a chain, I will give it 4 stars. A little expensive but the aura and food was very good."}
{"text":"This location is top notch! The food is always consistently great! The wedge salad is a great go to and on this night, we shared the tomahawk! If you think about it, the price is pretty much the same as 2 entrees so go for it! The sauces are to die for!  Wine selection is decent. The best part about this location is the amazing service provided by MARCO and his staff!!! He is attentive, super friendly and does whatever it takes to ensure you are happy with your experience at Flemings. Happy hour is always bustling and the dining room is filled with happy diners. :)"}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of steakhouses in general, but I went with a group of 10 colleagues, and I just went with the flow.  The food was typical of any upscale steakhouse.  A la carte steaks, seafood, and decent side dishes and desserts.  The atmosphere is very good.  I think the lighting was perfect, unlike one of the other reviewers who thought it too dark.  It was packed, and therefore a bit noisy.  The scalloped potatoes and lobster tempura were my favorites. The crab cake appetizer was disappointing.  I ordered the Alaskan sole, which was ok.   Reading other reviews would make one think that the service is awesome here, but not tonight.  Maybe I'm spoiled, but there are a few details that really bugged me.  They have an extensive wine list, and our host selected a very nice 2002 Cab.  The wine came out in decanters, and the server put the decanters on the table without pouring.  Ok, maybe giving it time to breathe.  But just seconds later, he started randomly pouring the wine for some of us, then walked away.  I thought perhaps he was pouring for those people who didn't have cocktails, which some of us brought over from the bar.  That would have made sense, but no, that wasn't it.  Even my boss, who ordered the wine, wasn't served.  So after a few minutes, I grabbed a decanter and started pouring a glass for myself, and offered to pour for him.  The waiter came over and said hang on, I'll get that for you.  Then he poured for a few other people.  Interestingly, the only 2 women at the table were among the last to be served.  No big deal, but I have come to expect that ladies be served first.   The entrees came out, once again my boss, and the one who was paying the bill, didn't get his entree with everyone else.  We two ladies got our entrees nearly last, and the servers confused the dishes.  We said that was wrong, he said, oh I'll fix that for you in a minute, walked away.  No big deal, we swapped our dishes ourselves, but really.   Then halfway through our meal, a manager came out with a half eaten re-fired steak.  Did someone get a refired steak?  Umm, not this table. Was kind of weird to have someone try to serve me someone elses well done half eaten steak.  In general, the servers just seemed kind of sloppy.  Not offering new silverware, stacking dishes, food not coming out at the same time.  Since one of the orders came out so late, we did get dessert comped.  A nice selection with large portions of various goodies from chocolate lava cake to cheesecake.  The key lime pie was very good.  To their credit, they were packed on a tuesday night.   My $5 happy hour cocktail was good.  The bill with tip came out to about $150 a head.  For that price, I would have expected more.  On the other hand, I am usually  disappointed with steakhouses like Morton's and Ruths Chris - they're just not for me.   If I want a steak,  I\"m equally, if not more satisfied, with firing up the backyard grill."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing.  Beautiful decor and the service is wonderful.  Has the prime rib dinner for $50.....   I think it was 3 courses and delicious.  Well worth the money and lots to take home.   The full size dessert (lava cake) was out of this world."}
{"text":"I'll give 4 Stars cause it's Flemings and the staff does well  As far as the food I'll take the Town Center location over this one any day.   I'll also give them a high 4 ( no 5 on this one) because it was Mothers Day and swamped."}
{"text":"Went here for an anniversary, and what can I say about this place, but wow!!! They really know how to wine and dine you here. This was the first place ever that I didn't have to season my steak or add any kind of sauce to it at all. I had the Filet Mignon, rare. Can you say, melt in your mouth like butter? Oh man! Everything is a la carte, meaning you'll order a steak, and sides are extra. Even though this place is a drive from the strip, it's worth it. A little on the high side, but once again, this is one of those places that you pay for what you get. I can't wait to visit again."}
{"text":"Seriously...been awhile in returning to our favorite steakhouse...major disappointment! Service was excellent as always. However, I will not forgive the chef for effin up Flemings potatoes. They were awful. A prefab presentation of what was once a signature dish...no longer. It looked like a prefab dish made in who knows where. Problem is where else have they cut to reduce their costs. Good bye Flemings and please let the chef know!!"}
{"text":"Had a super birthday celebration there this past weekend.  Absolute great meal and service.  Josh was very attentive all night long and gave us service way above and beyond.  Food was excellent, but expensive for what we got.   Will go back again!"}
{"text":"I always enjoy eating here.  Service is great and they're always willing to accommodate my lower calorie adaptations of things. Wine list is great. Parking is usually a pain but worth the hassle."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to Fleming's for a long time.  I love me some USDA Prime steak and, that's something Fleming's boasts about.  When we arrived in the parking lot there was valet service similar to Del Frisco's but, quite unneccessary and a bit tacky since there's ample parking close to the entrance.  The decor was classy, cozy, and inviting with upper-crust steakhouse decor (wooden and leather accents).  Despite the ambiance, the food was a mediocre and, so was the service.  We dined there either on a Tuesday or Wednesday evening and the servers seemed a bit overwhelmed/understaffed.  Foodwise, there was absolutely NO wow factor for a $230 meal (tip inclusive).  Winos, perhaps...?  Todd (hubby) orders a glass of Conundrum, and I order a glass of Riff pinot grigio.  Wine arrives in timely manner, yay!  Appetizers...yes/no?  The hubby ordered the crab cakes and said, they \"taste like they were frozen.\"  As most of you Yelpers know, I do NOT eat anything that swims, so I'm just reiterating my husband's rant.  I wanted to order the french onion soup and/or the Fleming's Salad but, saw/heard they were nothing spectacular, so I refrained and stuffed myself with bread.  The bread was pretty good with the sundried tomato butter and the feta cheese butter!  In fact, I ate so much bread before my steak that one of the server's assistants came around two times to brush off the bread crumbs...embarassing, I think so.    Hubby and I are having good conversation after his crab cakes/before our entrees that we only have about 1/3 of our wine left.  His wine has stuff floating in it.  Let me redefine \"stuff.\"  \"Stuff\" is looking like dandruff, plankton, particles floating in his wine.  We usually do drink wine with our meals but, NEVER had \"stuff\" floating in our wines.  It's possible breading from the crab cakes or crumbs from the bread could've stuck to his lips and floated into his glass but, this would've happened at other restaurants as well.  Todd inquires about the \"stuff\".  Our server said it was \"residual sugar\" but doesn't offer to replace the REMAINDER of his wine.  Not very classy/service-oriented for a steakhouse or that of any kind of restaurant.  Really, our server just lost mad brownie points with me because, the \"stuff\" that was floating in his wine was repulsive.  My wine was \"stuff\" free.  Relentless, dumb, hard headed, persistent, winos, we order two more glasses which were \"stuff\" free.  Our entrees took a little longer than anticipated to come out, hence all of the bread I ate.  I ordered the \"Main Filet Mignon\" (cooked medium) with a side of Cabernet reduction and Todd ordered the \"North Atlantic Lobster Tails.\"  For sides, \"Fleming's Potatoes\" and \"Creamed Sweet Corn.\"  As soon as I saw my steak, it looked less than impressive.  Yes, looks are deceiving but, not in this case.  My steak was overcooked (seemed like medium well--not much pink) and lacked taste.  I have never eaten such a poor USDA Prime filet until now; in fact, I have had way better USDA Choice filets.  I was so hungry, hence stuffing myself with the bread, that I just sucked it up and ate the steak.  Todd liked his lobster tails and said they were cooked perfectly but, also noted it's not rocket science to steam two 8oz. lobster tails.  Our sides were good and the portions were ample for 2-4 people.   To be honest with you, we probably would've ordered at least one dessert and more wine but, we were so underwhelmed with our food and service that we just wanted to get the experience over with.  He hoped, we tried, they failed.  Way better steakhouses in Vegas.  Hopefully, Fleming's can use this information to tighten up their ship."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  Dined at Flemmings for an important business dinner and the waiter knocked over a full glass of red wine square into my lap.  My shirt, pants, and purse were soaked.  The staff was quick to react and even offered to cover the cleaning bill.  However, they did not comp the wine or discount the meal in any way.  The Operating Partner, Jackie E., gave me her card to contact her for the cleaning, but when I reached out to let her know that I was luckily able to get the wine out with no staining, she didn't even bother to respond.  Nothing.  I at least expected a \"oh, good, glad to hear it\" kind of thing.  Hell, even an offer to return for a free appetizer or dessert.  But, nothing.  I really liked Fleming's, too, but after this experience, I won't be back."}
{"text":"I heard such great things about this place and was looking forward to our experience here.  I was not impressed. If you like wine, this is a fantastic place to visit.  They have an iPad dedicated to their wine and cocktail selection.  While this iPad is a novel idea, it is also a cumbersome item to have on your table.  I guess it's not much different than a drink menu, but it somehow seemed different.  The food.  It's good.  Not fantastic.  It's not worth the price you pay for it.  Service was good, and I assume it would have been better if all the staff had shown up for work.   As someone stated in another review:  \"it is Fleming's responsibility to provide food and service that will make you forget you paid $49 for an a la carte petite filet.\"    That didn't happen.  We left saying we paid too much for good food, not spectacular food.  Plus we were there over TWO HOURS.  I understand you can't rush fine dining, but we got there at 5:30 and left after 8:30.  They closed at 9.    Those who ordered the prime rib thought it was a very good cut of meat and would order it again.  The petite filet was just good.  It was not the best I've ever had.  I ordered it medium and it was almost overcooked.  One could have argued that it was indeed a medium cook.  I expected perfection,  I don't think that was unreasonable for the price I paid.   The sides were good and I can't really complain about them, but none of it was worth going back for me.  I think you can find a better restaurant for your special occasion."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here three times.  The first two times, we had good experiences.  The last time we went, the service was pretty bad.  We waited over 30 minutes for our entrees.  We would have had to wait longer if I hadn't flagged down our oblivious waitress as she rushed pass our table to tell her to check on our food.  Apparently they messed up on our order and never made our entrees until we brought this to their attention.  For a high end restaurant, we expected better service.  Waitress should have been trained to be more attentive to all of her tables....she should have been aware of what each table needs or how long patrons have been waiting for their food.  At least apologize and explain if they are busy. We would have been more understanding. We had to flag the waitress two other times to just to get refills on water. Also, my meal was supposed to come with a salad.  They never brought it out. The prime rib was ok.  I've had better.  The only reason I'm giving three star instead of two is because they did try to make up for the long wait by giving us a $25 gift card and we did have better experiences previously.   Overall, it was pretty disappointing recently."}
{"text":"Best restaurant ever. Nuff said, get some bread (and cheese spreads). But really this is my wife and I's favorite place for a quick date night away from the kids. Happy hour is exceptional. Get the prime burger . The bartenders are great as well!  Hey always listen to my b.s. and help blow off the stress of the day."}
{"text":"What a fantastic place.  The food was unbelievable.  If you like Salmon...get it here.  It was amazing."}
{"text":"If you eat only one expensive meal this year. Make it Flemings. No regrets. Make sure you try the cream spinach. It's the best I've had anywhere, ever."}
{"text":"I'm all about the steak.  I love to eat steak on a daily basis, so on a whim my hubby and I stopped by at Fleming's for dinner.  The dimmed seating area was romantical, and the service was great.  They even ask you if you prefer dark napkins before being seated.    The steaks were good.  They are juicy and flavorful.  The sides were yummy, too.  From their whipped potatoes to the vegetables, everything was delish.    So, you may be asking me, \"why 3 stars\", and the reason why is because it was just \"eh\" to me.  I wasn't wowed, nor did I dream of the steak or crave it the next day like I do with some others.  Still, for $125 for the meal, I wanted to feel more with the food.  I wanted to feel the love in the meat, the care for the cuts, and I somehow missed it.  Maybe it was the nonchalant servers or the sophisticated atmosphere.  Either way, it was a nice experience.  Overall, I have to say that they have good steaks, but after eating Gallagher's, Morels, and others down on the strip, the bar is set high on my palette."}
{"text":"This restaurant was pretty amazing.  I had 7:30pm reservations on a Friday night and we arrived 5 min early. Our table wasn't ready quite yet but we waited no more than 10-15 min since it was a full house.  The hostess apologized and was very polite and friendly.  Actually, the entire staff was extremely polite and very friendly.    When we were ready to order we put in for 1 appetizer and our meals +drinks.  They provided bread while we waited for our appetizer so it held us down for a bit, but that was when I realized that our appetizer was taking a while to come out. Finally, they came out with our food but still no appetizer. When I told the server he immediately ran off to check on our order. Soon after, the waiter returned with the appetizer and apologized for not bringing it out before our meals AND said it was on the house since it was their mistake.  The manager later came and also apologized and not only did she offer to take care of that item, but she also threw in a free dessert.  By the time we were done with our meals we were too stuffed to order a dessert so we told the waiter that we were fine without it. As we were waiting for our check to come, the manager came out once more and apologized again and gave us a small box of chocolate truffles PLUS a free $25 gift card.  It was completely unexpected but greatly appreciated.  The service was just outstanding considering they made such a small mistake.  The food was amazing as well and the ambiance of the restaurant was cozy and romantic.  I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"We had a great Valentine's dinner here last night. My Chilean sea bass was perfectly cooked and my husband's prime rib, while a bit fatty, was deliciously seasoned and cooked. Our server Malcolm was extremely attentive and friendly without being overbearing. I will say that the music was definitely too loud and definitely not really Valentine's kind of music...some techno, some unidentifiable crap. Lava cake was awesome, but the homemade burrata really stole the show for me."}
{"text":"I might be biased since I handle some of Fleming's PR, but this truly is one of my FAVORITE restaurants in Las Vegas. All the staff, from the hostesses, to the waiters and wine managers, to Chef Travis and Jackie are amazing and friendly.   I've taken many people to dine here, and they always have a great meal and a fabulous experience. Some of my favorites/ must haves...  - Lobster Tempura - Prime Burger (2nd best burger in Vegas next to Bradley Ogden in Caesars IMO) - All the new Small Plates items - Fleming's Potatoes - Creamed Corn  Enjoy! And say hi to Jackie and Travis. They love their guests."}
{"text":"I had high hopes since this is so close to my house.  I have even had friends rave about it.  So maybe I just had a bad night.  It wasn't bad, but it was far from great.  The atmosphere is very nice. We ate at the bar.  The dirty martini was good.  I ordered the calamari and pork belly apps followed by bone in ribeye.  The pork belly was excellent.  The calamari could have been excellent but it was a little rubbery.  The sauce was excellent, but the calamari itself let me down.  Then came the steak. It also had potential.  There were some very tasteful bites but overall my steak was a little chewy. Was far from a melt in your mouth cut.  Did not cut that easy either.  My girlfriend had the filet and the famous potatoes and loved them both.  So I guess the jury is still out for me.  In a city littered with phenomenal steak houses, they need to raise their game."}
{"text":"Food was great, but the service was slow. We had to wait several times to order more drinks.   To their credit we did probably go on one of the busiest days of the year (the Saturday after Valentine's Day).   The waiter was knowledgeable, knew the difference between different cuts of meat, and seemed to have the entire wine list memorized. The wine list was on an iPad which made browsing really easy.   For that kind of money $55 for a steak, and $10 for sauteed spinach, and 10-15/ glass of wine, I expect a more attentive staff, and less of a cafeteria feel.   I hope this review isn't too harsh, because literally every table had people at it, which could explain the slow service and crowded, and rushed ambiance.   On my next steak outing;I will be looking for a more subtle and refined experience, and will probably go smaller and independent. Food was solid, yet I expect more when I'm spending that much mullah."}
{"text":"One of my favorite happy hour spots!  I've been here for dinner and it's pretty good but in Vegas, there's probably at least another 30 steakhouses you can go to.   What differentates this steakhouse for me is the value of their happy hour.  This place sh1ts all over Kona Grill's happy hour.  We had each of the 5 appeteizers offered:  Tenderloin Carpaccio, Sweet Chili Calamari, Seared Ahi Tuna, Cajun BBQ Shrimp, and a Mushroom Ravioli.  They also offer wine by the glass and cocktails.  Every item is 6 bucks which makes it affordable to hit this spot frequently.  The only downside is in terms of food, there's only 5 items and i'm not sure how often it rotates.  Also, it's only served in bar till 7pm.    BUt still, for the value and quality of food for 6 bucks an appeteizer, you can't beat it."}
{"text":"My mother and I enjoyed the Sonoma Brunch with complimentary Passion Fruit Mimosas! We had the pancakes with berries & link sausages and the prime rib hash with scrambled eggs. Excellent service from our favorite server Jessica!! She's charming, knowledgeable and attentive!!! FAB-U-LOUS!!!!"}
{"text":"Overpriced, ambiance was good but the steak was Meh.The service was very slow too.  I would have rather spent my $200 dollars that was the cost of this dinner somewhere else, only highlight of my meal was the baked potato."}
{"text":"Best time to come is during happy hour before 7. 5 for $6 til 7 pm menu is where it's at! 5 cocktails, wines and appetizers for $6 a piece! There is also a decent burger and shrimp dish you can get for $6 as well!  I came here for my birthday and it was a good experience. Definitely recommend! Some day, I'll be back for the actual steaks."}
{"text":"I had the happy hour special, bacon cheese burger. Good stuff!   The bacon was smoked just right. The two onion ring sides were delicious. Ordinarily, I think it's rather pricey, so happy hour Wednesdays are good for the budget.  The service was mixed - I'll write off our slightly rude waitress until I go there again to see if there is something systemic."}
{"text":"My husband loves this place.  He likes the prime burger during Happy Hour and the filet Mignon for dinner date nights. The desert selection and the bread leave a lot to be desired.  The steak and the fish are good.  The creamed spinach is good too.  Place is a little pricey, but there aren't a lot of choices like this in the area so we're a captive audience."}
{"text":"I made reservations on Open Table before a Clippers game.  Came in 30 minutes late, they happily seated us.  Had one of the best Rib Eye Steaks ever.  I love this place.  Order the chocolate lava cake which takes 25 minutes to prepare... So order it when u order your steaks.  Service, Wine List is the best in the area!!"}
{"text":"We had a nice dinner,, but my wife got food posioning..  She woke up 4am and was ill and continued to be ill that day..  Could keep nothing down and very dehiderated.   The management while polite seemed to think I was shaking them down when I asked for a partial discount off our $300 bill..   Rather hard to accept such an event when dining at such a place..  Better luck.."}
{"text":"Went for Sunday brunch and our server, Michael, was the utmost professional. Not stuffy but attentive and amiable. The food was what I would expect from a steak house for brunch. Steak salad, burrata salad and carpaccio were hit appetizers. I had the Chilean Sea bass which was served in a broth. It was delightful. The sauteed mushrooms and asparagus were quite rich but delish- probably cooked in butter. They offered us each a complimentary glass of mimosa which was a nice touch to start the meal.  I'd come back. It's a great place to have a \"ladies who lunch.\" White linen table service."}
{"text":"Fleming's is one of my favorite summerlin dining spots. The food is great & its nice and quiet so you get to enjoy a peaceful relaxing dinner.  The waiters are great as well they make it a point to get to know you & welcome you back with open arms every time they see you."}
{"text":"An updated review for the newly renovated Fleming's Restaurant. The entire place has a new look from the bar area to the dining room. The lighting is still subdued but with ceiling spot lights above the tables and booths the menu is very readable. However, there were a few people that still needed help from their cell phone lights. The decor has softer material which results in the dining room being more conversation friendly. The restaurant  was very busy with all tables and booths being filled at 7 PM. Our server Rory was spot on. Although he had several tables to cover he kept an eye on our water glasses and followed up on our satisfaction with the help of a assistant to help deliver the food and clear the plates.  As in the past the food quality was excellent. The Petite Filets were prepared as ordered and tender and juicy. The asparagus was overcooked to my taste. My steak was ordered with the add on of jumbo crab meat served on top of the steak. I do not thing the quantity of crab meat deserved the additional amount charged. Either increase the portion or lower the price. However the crab meat was fresh and sweet.  If you are using the valet an expedited delivery is available. Just submit the valet receipt at time of payment and your server will request that your vehicle is out front by the time that you leave. No waiting for the valet to retrieve your vehicle."}
{"text":"This place is very upscale. Their rib-eye steak is good. I had shrimp and salad appetizer, both was pretty good too. I love their creme brulee, not too sweet, not to thick, perfect. This place is pack with people, very lively. It's a very nice restaurant to go to for dinner."}
{"text":"A crazy & impressive thing happened today.  I received a phone call on my cell from the manager of this location.  She read my review, researched the reservations, found my name & number, and called me to apologize.  What?!?!  She then proceeded to invite the family back for dinner on her.    I'll assume that the meal will be perfect.  At this point, the effort and the gesture is worthy of 5-stars.  I don't think I've ever received this level of  concern and customer service from a business.  Kudos to Flemings!"}
{"text":"For some reason, I am having difficulty finding a truly great steak in Las Vegas. Fleming's is just one of a number of examples. Keep in mind I am only speaking about the steak itself, not the accompaniments, desserts, drinks, etc.  There is no question that living in NYC my entire life has spoiled me to a great steak. Luger's, S&W, The Palms, Sparks, Morton's, Frankie & Johnnie's, the Old Homestead, and the list goes on and on. You go to ANY of these places, and you get a PRIME cut of beef.  I've complained to my friends here in LV, and they suggested I try Fleming's. What a disappointment. I've gotten comparable pieces of meat at the most ordinary supermarket. I can say the same about the Andiron and other steakhouses in the area. I also had similar experiences at the Echo & Rig (Tivoli Village), the Charcoal Grill at Santa Fe casino and even the T-Bones in Red Rock. Once again, I am strictly talking about the steaks themselves. I've had the Alaskan King Crab and the Dover Sole at T-Bones, and those meals were extraordinary.  But the steaks themselves would NEVER be classified as PRIME cuts of beef at any of the steakhouses I frequent in NYC. For the uninitiated, cuts of beef come in select, choice, and prime. I defy any of the LV steakhouses I've tried to authenticate their beef as PRIME. You put a prime cut of beef in your mouth and you'll know the difference. You don't have to chew until you're tired, and the flavor is outstanding. None of what I've tried in LV measures up."}
{"text":"No corking fee is the best part of this place. Calamari is great and you can't go wrong with any of the steaks. Last time we went I got the seared scallops, which were amazing. The bar is well stocked, always crowded, which can be a pain sometimes and make it difficult to get to the bar and order drinks but the wait is never long enough to bother me. The service is superior to anyplace we've ever been. The music they play isn't what you'd expect (Frank Sinatra) but rather new pop type music (Rob Thomas)."}
{"text":"I have eaten at a few steakhouses and by far this place takes the cake!!! From the moment I walked in til the minute we left I loved every single thing about this place. My server was marco, and let me say that he was by the best sever I have EVER had!!! The food was the best, steak was cooked perfect, food was hot, the taste was awesome!!! I was so excited I took pics after I started eating it lol!! I would give this place 10 stars.  It was for my birthday and marco brought me truffles and chocolate covered strawberries!! I would recommend this steakhouse to anyone!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Flemming's last night to use up our $200 worth of gift cards and to have one more big hurrah before we start our New Years resolution. Flemming's did not disappoint. From the greeting when we checked in to the bussers servers and the wine manager and the chef. We had an awesome evening and let me tell you the food\" all of it was cooked to perfection! We had the seafood trio appetizer \"you get a lobster tail 4 Jumbo shrimp and 4 huge crab legs all cut open for you (enjoy) then we both got the North Atlantic lobster tails delicious, I had to get a petite filet as well it was to die for! Shareable sides great idea we had the garlic mash asparagus and the mushrooms yummmm They boxed up our left overs for us. What I really liked is they were not too intrusive like a lot of restaurants. We love this place we have been together for 34 years and this was definitely one of our top dinning experiences!!!!"}
{"text":"Have been to this location several times. This review is based on my visits during happy hours in the bar rather than the dining room, as I have had better food and experience in the bar side.. My date & I had planned to eat in the dining room, but our first stop was in the bar to grab a happy hour drink. When we saw the 567 menu, it sounded so good and we already had a seat in the bar, we just decided to try it out.   Food) It was a great find! The boyfriend and I tried their $6 Prime burger, which was out of this world that night. We split it, so we could both try it. Their vodka HH martinis are always good and stiff. I love that I can get a blue cheese stuffed olives, freshly stuffed from their bar! We also tried the pork belly...it was special, I recommend it. Nice crispy rendered piece of pork belly with chutney. Lastly, we ordered the crusted shrimp. This was my favorite part of the meal, but we were too full to eat much.   The next time we went, we just ordered the burger and the crusted shrimp. Alas, the shrimp wasn't as tender, yet crispy, as they were the first time. The burger wasn't as juicy and flavorful that night either.  I've  eaten in their dining room, and I find it's just an okay experience for me. I like the life and activity in the bar side. I love the decor, the dark woods, the ambiance, the low lighting, and the sports on in the bar. It's just a little too stiff in the dining room for my wild personality. I like to be surrounded with activity. The dining room is more mature, subdued and better for a family dinner.  Service) is a 5 everytime, busy or not, dining room or bar.  Tip) If you are grabbing HH in the bar, better to go early. Starts at 4:30-7pm and the bar is small and full after after 5:30 pm. Though, we've always been lucky to slide into a spot even around 6:30pm...pure luck."}
{"text":"The food was good nothing to complain about. The place was pretty and romantic. The service wasn't all that great. Our waiter was rude and not a favorite of mine if i would of had a nicer waiter i probably would of loved it"}
{"text":"Food: Good but not exceptional, and stick with the red meat.  The New York Strip was good and properly medium rare, but did not really stand out _that_ much compared to other steakhouses.  The Marlin (was a nightly special) was overcooked, tough, and over-salted.  Portions quite large for dainty eaters like myself.  Service: No complaints.  Servers usually attentive to your drink needs but stay unobtrusive otherwise.  Value: Can't comment on this, as the meal was paid for by a third party for both my visits.  However, I am not sure based on my experiences that the food, though good, would be worth paying premium prices."}
{"text":"It is a steakhouse but their seafood is divine!! Love the scallops and shrimp with vermicelli vegetables.  Very tasty!"}
{"text":"This is my second time coming to Flemings and it was another great experience. Our server, Ray, was fun, energetic, and welcoming. We did the three course steak and lobster and it was all delicious and perfectly cooked. I had mentioned in my reservation that it was my birthday and it was warm birthday wishes from everyone who touched our table and to top off the meal a lovely box of delicious chocolate truffles. My boyfriend was debating on a cocktail during the meal and Ray suggested a Moscow Mule, their signature, seasonal drink; it was very tasty. I know it's a chain and maybe it's a little pricey but they always have deals going on and the service and quality of food are worth it."}
{"text":"I don't usually go to steak houses to eat, but we had a $100 gift card to Fleming's and of course had to try out this fine dining establishment. They had a 3 course meal special for around $45 which included a mushroom crostini appetizer, 8 oz. New York strip steak and clump crab cake and a chocolate dessert that was quite good.  I was impressed with the quality of the meal.  Everything was very tasty and the steak was deliciously seasoned and cooked perfectly.  I asked for rare plus and it came just as I asked.  I forgot what they called their chocolate dessert, but it was like creme brulee but with a chocolate flavour.  The only thing I didn't enjoy was the noise.  This place was too loud for my liking.  I would have enjoyed a more quiet meal with soft music in the background."}
{"text":"Yep, I am a fan. I'm a fan of happy hours and I'm a fan of good food too! I've been to the one on LVB a few times and enjoyed it quite a bit. I was in this side of town and saw that they offer the same HH specials. HH Specials 5 wines for $6 5 appetizers for $6 5 mixed drinks for.....$6 Bacon cheeseburger and tempura shrimp...$6 Service was good. Food was delicious and drinks are tasty. My kinda place for sure. Have been meaning to check out dinner and I will soon!"}
{"text":"If you're craving steak and don't want to leave the friendly confines of Summerlin, Fleming's should be near the top of your list. When we stopped in on a Tuesday night it was hopping and there was a 15 minute wait. So, apparently the fine folks in and around this master-planned community are well aware of the good eats here.  The atmosphere is just like any other traditional steakhouse. You've got your white linens, dark wood accents, mood lighting, etc. And, just like other steakhouses you'll find the typical steakhouse fare: for example a wedge and caesar salad, French onion soup, some seafood, and a variety of steaks. It's familiar, comforting, and (most importantly) good.  The crab cake appetizer ($15.95) consists of two small jumbo lump crab cakes in a lime butter sauce. They're lightly seasoned, allowing the sweetness of the crab meat to shine.  Unfortunately, the butternut squash soup ($9.50) was a miss. Thin, watery, and runny aren't good qualities for any soup.  The 14 oz. bone-in filet ($54) made up for it. While it could have benefitted from a more charred exterior, the seasoning was spot on and the quality of the beef was well worth the hefty price tag.  We had two sides. The sautéed mushrooms ($9.50) contained a variety, most of which were slightly overdone, which I actually prefer. The sautéed sweet corn ($8.50) was average at best.  Surprisingly, they have a kid's menu. With our little guy in tow, he gladly ordered a plate of chicken tenders ($14.95). What came out was a massive mound of crispy fries topped with several strips of chicken. The plate easily could have fed two or three kids. The meal also included an appetizer of celery, carrots, apples, and ranch. A kid's ice cream sundae is an additional $1.  Splitting an entree usually means the wife and I have room for dessert. We went with their chocolate lava cake ($10.95). You'll definitely want to share this dish. It was a big mound of cake and oozing belgian chocolate. The vanilla ice cream and chopped pistachios provided a wonderful contrast in temperatures and texture. Countless restaurants have a version of this dish, but this one was truly memorable. The fresh whipped cream on the side didn't hurt either.  The meal wasn't cheap but was much cheaper than a similar one on the Strip. They may play it safe with the menu, but it won't leave you disappointed. If you're looking for that traditional steakhouse experience it's good to know that you don't have to travel far to get it."}
{"text":"Had a bacon wrapped filet with crab stuffed shrimp for only $33 yesterday.  Good food and service.  That special is good until the 15 th"}
{"text":"We came here with couple of friends late last night.   The location was pretty easy to get to. Lots of parking and if you so incline they have a valet at the front door. I'd suggest making reservations since this place could get busy.  The ambiance is nice and quiet.   We sat in the newly remodeled and expanded bar.  We looked at their happy hour menu called Eight Nine Ten where you select any small plate and add a 9oz. Big Pour for just $5 from 8-10 pm nightly. My bf had the New Zealand Lamb Chops and I the Fleming's Lobster Tempura.  The lamb chops was tender and tasty. The breading of the lobster tempura was a little too thick.  The menu is well balanced and the wine selection list is good.  We really enjoyed our dinner and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Nice interior layout with the bar higher up than the dining area. Nice ambiance.  The dress code is more casual and laidback than I expected.  You can either dress up or be in your normal happy hour outfit.  You won't feel over or under dressed.  I'm not too thrilled about their free starter bread.  The calamari was cooked with bell peppers and onion instead of just by itself.  It's a little too saucy than what I'm used to for calamari but it was very tender.  I tried both PORCINI RUBBED FILET MIGNON and PEPPERCORN STEAK.  The portions were smaller than some other steakhouses which was perfect for me.  I actually finished my filet mignon.  It was cooked perfectly.  The peppercorn steak was a little dry and nothing really special.  The service was top notch.  I also received a small box of chocolate because it was my birthday."}
{"text":"People - come here for their happy hour!  $6 burgers can't be beat.  We were celebrating, so we also ordered lobster tempura.  Another fabulous dish.  Along with great drinks, and the deconstructed smores dessert, the meal was awesome.  But the service was a little....slow.  It wasn't overly crowded in the bar, but our server was a little flighty and needed a few reminders.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Our server Logan provided excellent service, along with everyone else who helped at our table. The food was great, especially the Brussels sprouts. Logan offered to buy us a dessert to compensate for my steak being over cooked, but kindly declined bc it wasn't his fault. Had a great dinner."}
{"text":"I came here over Labor Day Weekend specifically for their Happy Hour as I heard there were specials in the bar all night. Their Happy Hour menu is 5 for $6 until 7 and they follow that up with 8 for $9 until 10 For the holiday weekend the 5 for $6 until 7 was available until close in addition to the regular 8 for $9.  There are quite a few options on both menus.  I had the Blueberry Lemon Drop, French Twist Lemonade and the Bourbon Peach Martini.  I prefer the drinks off the earlier menu as my taste falls on the sweeter side.  For appetizers we ordered the sweet chili calamari, pan-crisp pork belly, prime burger the lobster lettuce wraps.  My favorite was definitely the burger.  It came with a side of fries and it's well worth just going there for the burger alone.  The lobster lettuce wraps were a disappointment because they weren't put together well making them hard to eat because they were just falling apart.  Service was what you would expect from Fleming's.  The bar is quiet and intimate.  I look forward to coming back to try some other menu items."}
{"text":"The service at Fleming's is impeccable. Better even than some restaurants with fancier pedigree and fame.  The hostesses greet you warmly like you are relatives of theirs, but without false cloyingness or gushing.  The servers greet you immediately, and your main server is right there. Ours was a friendly and capable woman who knew the menu well, and was enthusiastic about the food, but also cared about our having a good experience. Don't miss the Fleming's cheese potatoes (whatever they're called). The creamed spinach was top notch, as were all of the sides. The steak was certainly cooked well and of high quality.  It was not \"blow you away\" good, but quite good. Certainly not a surprise that it comes with a high price.  The desserts we got (the bread cake and the chocolate lava cake) were a bit rich after a rich meal, but decadent in a good way. But the main thing to come here for is the feeling that you are going to a very good Steakhouse with the comfort of a \"Cheers,\" where everybody knows your name."}
{"text":"I DO NOT mind this place, at all. Seafood tower kicks butt. I forget what else I had but it was good. Went very well with my many Old Fashioned cocktails- which were pretty much a rocks glass full of whiskey and a slice of an orange to fool the passer by-ers."}
{"text":"We ate here for the very first time last night. A few people had suggested it, saying it was really good.   I ordered a wedge salad to start, it was very good although I have had better.   For my dinner I ordered the dry aged New York and a lobster tail. And we ordered sautéed mushrooms, green beans, and garlic mash potatoes for sides.   Everything was great and I was surprised, I had no idea of the quality of food here, very nice place.   One thing I need to mention is the lobster tail and the sautéed mushrooms were both amazing, best I ever had in both cases.   The service was also great. one of my favorite things about eating at a very nice place is the service and they did not disappoint.   We will definitely be eating there again!"}
{"text":"Fleming's has very good steaks.  They are not the best in Madison as some people claim, that honor goes to the Tornado Club.  I had the Ribeye, and it was delicious, great flavor and cooked a perfect medium rare just as I requested.  The ribeye was slightly over salted though, but the flavor made that barely noticeable.  The sides are served family style which is something I like.  The Fleming's potatoes are amazing(Potatoes with cheese, cream, and jalepeno pieces) and the grilled asparagus was flawless.  4 and a half stars, but since that isn't a rating they get rounded down and not up."}
{"text":"Where to begin, I have heard a few good things about Fleming's steaks so we decided to check it out. Our waitress greeted us warmly letting us now she was hung over before we ordered so we were alredy off to a good start. To our surprise one of the plates still had remnants of the last diners chocolate lava cake on it. I proceeded to look onto my plate and you guessed it more lava cake. Most people at this point would've walked out but no we stuck around. We figured accidents happen it's not the biggest deal. Our waitress let us know that she informed her manager about the situation and the manager jokingly said that she would buy us the lava cake on her. I was not amused. This alone constitutes a one star rating but it's not that anyone made any effort to reconcile the issue its that the waitress and the manager both found the situation to be amusing.  I'm glad the gentleman sitting next to us were equally disgusted by how that situation was handled and for those reasons Flemings deserves zero stars. Stuff happens but don't be rude about it. Thanks"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite, special occasion date night spots. My wife loves their seafood tower, and this at a steak house. Upscale dining without being to pretentious. Food is consistently good and the service is always friendly and efficient. All told it makes for a wonderful evening out."}
{"text":"I'm continually surprised by the ratings for this place.   Service was decent.   Food average .  Price high.   I just don't get it.  This review won't be long enough to score  as epic because I can say it in one word \"meh\""}
{"text":"Service was substandard at this fleming's location. Wine list was very good, but service slow. Scalloped potatoes and porcinini rubbed  fillet were very good, but the soft fillet was grainy. I haven't encountered this before. So I have to knock a star off. It was the char and the porcini sauce that made the steak, not the meat itself. Something seemed wrong.  The night I went servers were dawdling around and the placed closed early. The salamander was turned off a half hour before last table time. This infuriates me.   I don't know how a restaurant can charge these prices in this area and get away with such bad service. I was generally not happy with this Fleming's location and I think the prices in San Francisco Bay Area were actually cheaper than this place.  The ZD Cab was excellent, and the Italian white they had was very good.   I was underwhelmed by the meal at this price point. Super high end food is getting harder to find and quality is dropping across the board to deal with rising food costs."}
{"text":"We have been here three times (because we love the food) & each time, the service has been less than stellar, surprisingly; since the prices are 5-star high!  They do, I must say, move to make it right!    Food awesome!!!  Kitchen strained. We came on Mother's Day and we waited 45 minutes for our salad. Our food came about 20 minutes after and they forgot my mother's baked potato. Really great server- but service terrible. Guessing the kitchen understaffed- or, they added a menu for Mother's Day and weren't ready for that!  My brother LOVED the Prime Rib! Said it was probably the best he ever had. The mashed potatoes with parsley and truffle - divine! I really enjoyed my Ahi Tuna.....  I would definitely order it again.  The short ribs are YUM!!!!  We are about to have dessert & are looking forward to that too!"}
{"text":"How well one of the steaks was prepared, friendliness from the bussers, and the extensive wine list is the only reason why this place gets 2 stars.  We randomly decided to go here tonight for dinner because it's one of the places I wanted to try for years based on all they hype created around it. Needless to say, it was very disappointing.  The service from our server, Monica, was not as prime as the steaks.  Her tone of voice sounded very condescending, and it was like she did not care.  Hospitality was not unrivaled as their website boasts.  I think she passed by our table about 5 times before we had to ask her for another fork, as mine was missing from the busser clearing the table before the main course was to arrive.  Normally, a server periodically checks on their patrons to make sure everything is good, or if they need anything else.  Instead, she was more interested in holding up the wall while heavily engaged in conversation with her manager and co-workers several times throughout the 2 hours we were there.  Another thing which was kind of bothersome is I overheard another server give a nice introduction to their party, and go over the special of the night with his party.  None of that happened when Monica approached our table.  She just approached the table and asked if we wanted wine.  The only way we knew her name was because the hosted told us who our server would be.  The other steak which wasn't prepared how asked, was overcooked.  I'm going to assume because it wasn't properly communicated to the chefs how it was to be prepared.  The price of dining there is expected because of the so-called reputation and preparation of the steaks.  However, if I am going to pay fine dining prices for a steak, then it should be accompanied with fine dining service.  I would have raised my concerns to the manager, but never got the opportunity to meet her being that she table touched every table except ours.  I can see if it was busy in there to get this type of service, but it wasn't even busy in the restaurant."}
{"text":"We went for dinner for my wife's birthday. We we're given a sizable gift card (otherwise we would have broke the bank). From what I understand, Fleming's is a chain, and it certainly felt that way given our wait time between drinks. The steak and salmon were both incredible and the price reflected the quality of the meat. Still, was looking for something a bit more singular for the money."}
{"text":"Latest experience was much better!  Came one night with a coworker for late dinner and we definitely enjoyed our meal! The hostess was really nice and seated us right away.   Our waiter was also very nice and come to give us recommendations. I got the 3 course filet and salmon duo summer dinner for $40.95, SCORE!! Everything tasted delicious! The filet was cooked rare exactly how I like it and the salmon was moist and soft, not dry at all.   Bathrooms are clean and valet parking is available."}
{"text":"Flemings just keeps getting better and is now one of our favorite restaurants in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Had a private lunch event here a couple of weeks ago in one of the back rooms. Everything was great - the food, attentiveness of the staff...I have no complaints at all. I'd definitely have more events at Fleming's. The blueberry cheese cake is amazing, my guests were still raving about it days later."}
{"text":"Apps and dinner were FABULOUS!! Steak was cooked to perfection and Lobster was exquisite! Service was awesome... We'll be back SOON!!!"}
{"text":"Our baby shower at Flemings was a wonderful, successful and gorgeous event!  The service by Logan and Jones was impeccable, they took care of every detail! Chef Isiah, was outstanding! Guest were complimenting the food and presentation as it was being served, from appetizers to desert!  All of the different entrees were delicious 5 star as well!  The truffles he made as gifts to ours guest was a big hit.......melt in your mouth....dark and white chocolate deliciousness!!    The pink mimosas were a great added touch!  Leslie, the Private Event Coordinator is a joy! She is professional, and excellent at her job. She makes everything exciting as well as stress free!! Leslie takes care of every detail!   Anyone or any company thinking of hosting an excellent event that friends, family or clients will enjoy.....choose Fleming's....do not hesitate! Call Leslie! It will be memorable!!! And Delicious!"}
{"text":"Friends and I came for dinner.  Food was disappointing.  I could not finish the lobster tempura as lobster was mushy and salad had way too much ginger.  Wine list is excellent. Blue lava chocolate cake was yummy. Prices are ridiculously high. I won't return."}
{"text":"Seated right away, food was amazing and service, Jones was outstanding! Pick his brain about anything on the menu! Jones is 100 percent   The manager walks around and greats everyone. Very nice. But when I ask about the warm temperature of the restaurant, she said she knew and there was nothing they could do about it. Sounds like cutting corners on cost of operation."}
{"text":"We ordered the Tomahawk 35 oz steak for dinner last night and had quite a bit of leftovers.  Fleming's had it wrapped in foil and sealed in Fleming's own plastic bag.  This I just opened.  It has been reduced to just a big bone.  Such disappointment!"}
{"text":"amazing service, went there for my prom was not disappointed, amazing steak some of the finest in las vegas for its price"}
{"text":"All in all, not bad. In fact I was surprised, since this restaurant is part of a chain and I'm always suspect of chain restaurants.  Meat: wet-aged (not my preference). Properly cooked. Perhaps a little underseasoned, but quite juicy and flavorful.  Sides: A la carte. Very good, especially the crispy shoestring fries.  Wine: Outstanding selection of wines by the glass. This may be the single best thing about the restaurant.  Service: Also outstanding. You get a lot of attention from the parking valet onward.  It's a signficant distance from the Strip, which in the end probably makes it not worth the effort since there are so many other choices on the Strip that are only a fraction more expensive...but if you live near Summerlin, and don't want to walk miles from a casino parking lot to a casino restaurant (God I hate that), then Fleming's is a pretty good alternative."}
{"text":"Went here with the family for Christmas Eve dinner....everything was phenomenal from the service to the atmosphere to the food.  I had the lamb chops medium rare as recommended by the chef, and they were outstanding.  Add my usual two brandy Manhattans and I'm well done :-)  Definitely one of those restaurants where any choice on the menu will make you happy."}
{"text":"Very delicious steaks here with a nice atmosphere.  The steaks are delicious with sides.  Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome, well off the strip, a local'ish only kind of place.  Food, atmosphere, happy hour was fantastic.  Well worth the cab ride ($35) each way from the strip.  If you drove in, even better.  Flemings Potato's are fantastic."}
{"text":"I'd love to give this place more than two stars but their wine prices are almost laughable.  TRIPLE what some other places charge for the same wine.  Come on.    As far as the food, yeah, its ok.  Slightly below Mortons or any of the other big chains.  The seafood platter tasted frozen and watery.     Maybe the best steak in Madison but at these prices I expected more (and I really like expensive steak joints...this one just isn't worth it)."}
{"text":"I really, really tried my best to hate on Fleming's.  See, I'm kind of a food snob, so when I crave a delicious steak, I usually find myself at some independent local joint, not a chain owned by the Outback.  But when Fleming's sent me an email saying they're offering $25 off any check of $50 or more for the rest of the year, I had to give it a shot.  From the moment I walked in the door, I was treated to really good customer service.  Well, that's not quite true.  I arrived at 8:51pm for a 9pm reservation and was told they weren't ready to seat us, yet.  Seemed a bit odd as they had open tables.  We grabbed a seat at the bar and perused the menu, and before we could decide if we were going to get a drink first, they came over to seat us.  From then on, it was great customer service.  I ordered the filet mignon medium rare and my buddy Mario ordered a different cut, don't remember which one.  Mine was $40 and his was $42, and both were absolutely delicious.  Neither of us left a bite of steak on our plate.  I'm going back soon and getting Mario's choice because it had so much flavor.  Fleming's also offers complimentary sauces for your steak, of which Mario partook in one.  We were also celebrating my birthday, and they brought the hugest piece of chocolate cake I've ever seen for a freebie.  When the check came, it was just over $60 after tax.  They took off the $25 pre-tax, so actual savings is more like $27.  We left a handsome tip and vowed to come back within the next week.  I'm very tempted to come here solo and have a steak and an appetizer for even cheaper!  UPDATE 08/24/12: I finally went for happy hour and tried their $6 burger.  Amazing.  Not the best burger I've ever had, but plenty tasty, and HUGE for $6.  And it came with two delicious onion rings and a fantastic dipping sauce.  Only ordered a water with it and got no \"happy hour attitude\" from the staff.  Love it."}
{"text":"My wife and I wanted a great steak. We had a craving for steak and we are so happy we chose Fleming's everyone smiled and greeted us and make sure we were taken care of the service was above and beyond will never run out of water our table is always clean and the steak was outstanding we are just sitting here still tasting the wonderful steak and thinking about the great experience we had today thank you to the entire staff of Fleming's"}
{"text":"Very good steaks and sides but there is nothing about this place that separates it from every other high end steak house in town.  I like their French onion soup."}
{"text":"I've had the opportunity to eat at lots of nice steak houses and this place can certainly hold its own with many of them.  We called last minute and was able to get a 7:30 reservation on a Saturday night in August. The place wasn't very busy when we arrived despite the hordes returning to the campus fro move in day. We were seated at a table in the center, warmly greeted and served a special \"appetizer\" (aka warm bread with some flavored butters) and presented with the iPad wine list.  While on the one hand it's nice to be able to drill down into their broad selection of wines and wines by the glass, the tech side needs some filtering capabilities to be more useful.  I ordered a glass of prosecco and crab cakes and my son a spotted cow beer and Cesar salad. We each ordered a petite (8 oz) filet and decide to share an order of steak fries-the steaks, around $45 each don't come with anything except a knife.  The steaks were cooked and seasoned to perfection and the fries hot and crispy. All in all, tasty food.  So, you might ask, why only 3 stars? Well two reasons really, the generic suburban atmosphere of the place and the price. I had an additional glass of wine with my steak and my son a second beer and the bill was almost $200. I just think that is too much.  I certainly wouldn't hesitate to commend the quality and taste of the food but probably wont be back. For me the tornado room has equally good food, and is a much better value."}
{"text":"Food was good, but not worth the price. We went for to celebrate a special occasion and were underwhelmed. Will not be coming back. There are much better and more affordable places to eat. Felt like I was tricked by all the hype over this place."}
{"text":"The food was excellent, the service less so hence only 3 stars.  I ordered the Porcini rubbed filet and my wife ordered the Lite filet.  My steak was 8 ounces and hers was 6 ounces.  Mine came with asparagus--3 spears and hers came with Fleming's potatoes.  I ordered mine black and blue and she ordered hers medium.  Both were cooked perfectly and were delicious.  I didn't taste any porcini from the porcini rub.  I thought there'd be more than 3 asparagus spears so I didn't order an extra side and the small amount of Fleming's potatoes was fine for my wife.    We were started with a nice breadbasket with two kinds of flavored butters.  I didn't overdo the bread because I wanted to enjoy the steak and to have some room for dessert.  When we ordered our meal, the server informed us they needed 10 minutes to prepare the chocolate lava cake if we opted for that for dessert.  Part way through our meal, the server stopped by and asked if she should put in an order for the lava cake.  I thought it was a bit early, and should have declined at that time, but instead I trusted her knowledge.  I am a fast eater, my wife is a tortoise.  Another server brought the dessert to the table just as my wife put down her fork from her meal.  When this other person saw the table hadn't yet been cleared, she took the cake back to the kitchen and placed it on a shelf.  She then came back and cleared the table, went back to the kitchen, and returned with the dessert with its now melting ice cream.  Also, they failed the sweetener packet test miserably!  When you're paying as much for your meal as you do at Fleming's, you expect good if not excellent service.  This simply wasn't good service.  I would give this place a 2 star rating based on just the service, but the steaks were so good I raised it to three.  It was OK if not A--OK.    With all the good steakhouses in this city, I won't be returning even though it's close to where I live."}
{"text":"Wait!  You haven't checked out the happy hour here?  Stop reading and do so and afterwards continue reading.  From 5-7, small plates and wine are only $6 which given the quality of the food and wine is a damn good value.  Throw in the patio on a nice summer night and this maybe my new go to spot for after work refreshments."}
{"text":"Been to other locations - this one is  hit or miss; did have 1 good meal there but overall just not very good or consistent. Porterhouse special wasn't very special and for $99 it was a disappointing amount of food / sides. The fillet was good and done perfectly but strip was sinewy chewy. Companions fillet was good and the mashed were good but best thing going is lava cake dessert. Service was OK for perhaps a Perkins not so much  for a steakhouse that tries to compare to ruths mortons capitol grill, etc.  Reason place was almost empty 8pm on a weekend becomes obvious. Passing on this joint in future."}
{"text":"40 th anniversary dinner.  Service good, food average, but too expensive.  8 oz filet $41.50, salad $11, potato $11, dessert $13, couldn't afford drinks.  Total bill with tip $ 154 for 2 people, each having petite filet, 1 side, split one dessert, no drinks, no soup or salad  Had just as good a meal at Applebys for 1/4 the price"}
{"text":"I love it when my occupation (resident IT Stud) allows me to go to these 'IT seminars' where we learn about new technology coming out on the market.  I especially love it when these seminars are at a swanky place that most times I can't afford!  For this one I put my game face on, shined my glasses, put my pocket protector in place, and headed out to Fleming's Prime Steakhouse in the NW part of town.  Goodness (and geekiness) ensued.  After being greeted at the door and lead to the registration table for the seminar, I found a nice table in the back where I would be little bothered with the meal I was about to consume in honor of network technicians everywhere.  Met up with some fellas I know from another division in our state network, and chatted about the upcoming 3G/4G service disposition, as well as rumors about the fall of Apple stock, and possibly the state of pocket protector technologies (very important).  After a round of iced tea and virgin Margaritas (silly nerds) we were welcome by our hosts of the day.  Of course at this point, my mind kind of tuned itself out and focused solely on the menu we were going to enjoy at today's techie outing.  Each table was started out with a loaf of warm bread (damn you carbs) with some great whipped herb butter.  We were also allowed to share several appetizers per table:  -Cedar Roasted Mushroom & Artichoke Flatbread - monterey jack cheese, roasted red peppers, and garlic  -Prime Steakhouse Meatballs - with shiitake mushrooms, and peppercorn sauce  -Housemade Burrata - charred grape tomatoes with wild arugula, served with garlic crostini  -Fleming's Salad - complete with candied walnuts, dried cranberries, tomato, onion, and herbed croutons  All very good.  Nice start to a meal, eh?  After a brief break from eating, we were all treated to a what seemed like a very, very, very long seminar on cloud computing, virtual servers, and BLAH BLAH BLAH.  I know, I should have been listening better.  Thankfully, not soon after we were allowed to complete the orders of our lunch.  We had our choice of:  -Petite Filet Mignon -Breast of Chicken -Barbecue Scottish Salmon Fillet  I always say, at a steakhouse, do as the carnivores do.  I just had to go with the Petite Filet Mignon.  Come on, USDA Prime, seasoned with only black pepper and kosher salt, then broiled at 1600 degrees till your choice of doneness?  I.  AM.  GAME.  I'm like Missy Elliott in an over-produced rap video,  'Doot..doot-doot-doot-doot-doot-doot...Get ur' freak on...doot-doot-doot-doot-doot..'  That baby came to the table sizzling.  It was a nice cut, but being petite it was probably around the 5-6 oz. range.  But no complaints here!  Meat was succulent, tender, and juicy all around.  Cooked just right for me at a medium rare.  It wasn't the best filet I've had, but it was very good.  For free...it was excellent!  Although looking back, that salmon fillet looked really yummy as well.  Maybe next free power lunch!  Along with our entrees, each table got to share a sampling of some of Fleming's fabulous sides.  I managed to finagle (nerd rage galore) scant tastings of:  -Mashed Potatoes with roasted garlic -Chipotle Cheddar Macaroni & Cheese (oh man this was delish) -Sauteed Spinach  All great, all loaded with extra butter.  Thank God for that slice of bread I saved from earlier!  I sopped it all up.  Fatty McGhee was in the house.  But wait...there's more!  At the end of our IT seminar we were treated to a nice slice of Cheesecake - NY style topped with blueberry sauce and white chocolate shavings.  What a way to send me off back to work!  Food coma in the making.    The only thing missing from this seminar was the usual free USB flash drives sporting the company's logo (I really needed one), and the fact that I never, ever win the door prize from these things.  I think this time the grand prizes were a Best Buy gift card, and a gift certificate from Fleming's themselves.  But, at least I got away with a free company pen and a full belly.  And a lifetime's worth of annoying phone calls asking me to try their tech products free for 30 days.  Oh, but sometimes those phone calls are totally worth it.  Free meat for all techies!"}
{"text":"I've been to Flemings probably a dozen times in San Diego and Rancho Cucamonga.  This is my first time to the Las Vegas location.  The set up, size, vibe, and service is as consistent as it gets, but that's not necessarily a good thing.  I'm fine with the service and ambiance for the most part.  My only issue is the noise.  Tough to enjoy your steak and company when all you hear is everyone's conversation.  Regardless, I still had a decent dinner with the gf here the other night.   As for my meal, I have never deviated from their 8 oz petite filet mignon.  Before dinner, I scoped out the menu and contemplated on something different.  But guess what? I chose the petite filet again.  The steak was decently sized, but was a little disappointed on the overall taste. I got my steak medium-well and thought it was too pink. As for taste, I thought it was just \"A-Ok\".  For a pinkish steak, I thought it tasted burnt. I don't know if it was Fleming's or if my taste in steaks have changed. Price is about what you expect at a steakhouse.  However, I've had better steaks with the same price points.    Overall, will I be back?  I'm sure I will one day.  Maybe next time I'll try their lobster or seafood.  PS:  Their Mushrooms Ravioli is phenomenal."}
{"text":"I had heard of Flemings before, but never had been. Wow, was I missing out!!! I live for a Bone-in Filet!!!! I had been to Prime at Bellagio and would def say this was just as good, if not better! We had a wonderful atmosphere, great wine, amazing food, and our waiter Paul was the icing on the cake (which we were too full to try, lol) So glad we spent our anniversary there!!! Totally recommending this to all my friends! Thanks Flemings!"}
{"text":"It's about time that I went to a half-decent steakhouse. Well worth the wait, but also perhaps a mere beginner's course in a restaurant genre which I've clearly been missing out on.  I was surprised this morning with the very welcome news that I had the opportunity to attend a private dinner at Fleming's in Summerlin. Seeing as I was free, I gleefully went. As you may have gathered, I was excited. Aside from the Brazilian buffet places, the only steakhouse that I can recall visiting is a location of the Black Angus chain.  Now that you're done laughing, I've definitely had some excellent steak and beef from restaurants including a newer Strip favorite and a sublime non-AYCE Korean BBQ restaurant, so I do have enough experience to stand on regarding meat consumption. I was really looking forward to having steak tonight, and as anticipated, our menu had an option for a steak. As I deduced from the Private Dining menu on the Fleming's web site (after the fact), we were treated to a slightly modified \"Reserve Dinner\" (quoted at $82 but complimentary tonight; note that options may vary per host's choices).  Housemade Burrata: charred grape tomatoes, wild arugula, toasted garlic crostini. Soft, spoonable cheese over crunchy bread is good enough, but throw in almost-melting tomatoes and the ubiquitous bitterness of arugula and you've got a great appetizer.  Seared Sea Scallops: crispy bacon-wrapped, orange-tarragon vinaigrette. Tender scallops with a not-too-sweet dressing. Bacon is almost cheating, but I always welcome it. Almost wanted to grab seconds, but I guess I hadn't had enough wine yet.  Modern Caesar: hearts of romaine, parmesan, fried capers, prosciutto chips. Unlike the shared plates before, this was presented as one plate per person, and it has a reasonable portion larger than a side salad but nowhere near an entree. As per my sentiments above, crispy Italian hammy bacon was certainly welcome.  Petite Filet Mignon. I opted for this rather than Shrimp & Sea Scallops, and of course there was no way I was even considering the Double Breast of Chicken at a steakhouse. Steak came out medium-rare as requested and was thoroughly knife-tender (no, not fork-tender). Filet mignon has a reputation as lacking flavor, but this was seasoned well throughout and especially benefited from the excellent seared crust. Certainly one of the better steaks that I've enjoyed in admittedly very limited experience.  Creamed Spinach and Truffle-Parsley Mashed Potatoes: two separate, shared sides that were both creamy and both compatible with my filet. The spinach had absolutely none of that watery feeling that you sometimes see in wilted veggies. The mash was smooth and prominently truffled.  Carrot Cake: three-layer cake with cream cheese frosting, dark rum caramel drizzle. The frosting was a little too sweet, but the mint garnish actually helped to offset and temper the saccharine quality. It was a nicely textured cake that almost made me not pine for a cheesecake (available per menu customization) or something chocolatey (not available in this price range).  Service was solid. The servers worked unobtrusively during our program and kept pouring wine (for me, the 14 Hands Cabernet Sauvignon 2014, certainly a viable wine even if relatively inexpensive) throughout the night. Some servers even carried an impressive five or six plates to an arm, which was certainly helpful for presenting the courses to each table as concurrently as possible.  It wasn't a truly divine experience, but Fleming's made me a very satisfied diner tonight. For lesser-experienced carnivores such as current-me, I'd definitely recommend going for a regular dinner. As for my personal growth, I'd probably be better off exploring the world of steak more deeply at other venues around town, both off- and on-Strip."}
{"text":"After going back and forth on where to go to commemorate our 1-year wedding anniversary, my husband and I decided on Fleming's. It was our first time coming here and really didn't know what to expect. The ambiance and low lighting drew us in immediately. Our entrees were superb and they even had a good selection for the kids menu. Really great for big occasions!"}
{"text":"Thanksgiving at Fleming's was pretty good.  The place was packed!  My turkey was very moist, they gave you a piece of white and dark meat.  The stuffing was ok and the other sides werent memorable.  The buttermilk biscuit was awesome, it was crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside (very much like a croissant).   Our waiter was excellent and even joined in on our topic of Star Wars!"}
{"text":"Great food. Exceptional service. Affordable specials ."}
{"text":"When we arrived, we were told that there was a 45 minute wait even though we could clearly see lots of open tables.  We were not guaranteed a table since we arrived 60 minutes to their closing time.  So we sat at the bar and were helped immediately - but it was clear the bar staff was interested in getting out of there as soon as possible.  We eventually were seated (to our surprise) and the atmosphere and experience in the restaurant was quite different from the bar.  Our waitress was wonderful.  She made a great wine selection and we found the fact that she gave us her business card a little hysterical - but she was knowledgeable and friendly and quick - what more could you ask for?  It might have been nice if she didn't recommend a glass of wine that went for about $20.  My husband loved his two-steak dinner but his crab cakes were dry and tinny tasting, like the crab wasn't fresh and there were too many breadcrumbs.    I ordered the oysters Rockefeller and they were decent but the spinach did not taste fresh, either.  My osso bucco was awful; it should have been falling off the bone but it did not taste like it had been stewed long enough.  The connective tissues were not broken down and it made eating the thing impossible.  Additionally, it was not hot when it arrived.  I took it home and will use it to make stock - what a shame and waste.  The asparagus spears were undercooked but the risotto was great.  It was a fun dinner for our \"date night\" because of the atmosphere but I don't imagine we will return.  We were really floored when we received the bill - had no idea that one Newcastle beer would cost more than actually buying a six pack of Newcastle.  So no - definitely NOT worth the cost.  For what we spent on dinner at Flemings, we could have had two amazing meals at L'etoile or Harvest."}
{"text":"We had our wedding reception here in their private dining room.  We had a fairly small party (about 20) and I was a little skeptical about having it at a regular restaurant.  I wanted to make sure it still felt like a special occasion and not just dinner with friends.  Mission accomplished!    First, the events coordinator Leslie was PHENOMENAL! She was involved, thoughtful, offered suggestions but also deferred to our preferences, and truly cared about having a spectacular night.  The staff who served us were fantastic also. I wish my ceremony venue had a fraction of the care and support that this group had.  The night was just perfect thanks to the Fleming's team.  All of my guests had wonderful things to say about the experience and every single person raved about the food.  It was out of this world! The icing on top was the very reasonable pricing.  We could not be happier with the experience we had with Flemings.  We will definitely go back again for regular dining, as well as anniversary dinners, and will highly recommend this venue to our friends. THANK YOU FLEMING'S!"}
{"text":"Haven't had a sit down dinner there yet. Only had appetizers and drinks at the bar. Every time I'm there I've have always received great service from the bartender. If you live in the area, this is definitely a place to visit."}
{"text":"Wow, some great reviews on this restaurant. To bad I didn't have their experiences.  The service was fine, not overly wonderful. We both had the Filet Mignon, it was alright, nothing special. I've had better at other steak houses. My husband ordered some asparagus to go with the meal, it was over cooked and chewy.  The Flemings salad was very good and so was the carrot cake.  Why just 3 stars, the steak just didn't cut it for us, and we are meat lovers. If you do go, get the carrot cake, skip the filet mignon."}
{"text":"We had a gift certificate and decided to use it last minute. I went with a family friend, both of us with steakhouse experience.  This restaurant offers a great atmosphere, great service and ridiculously well-done steaks. It is in a great location right next to Hilldale Mall.  I had the Petit Filet Mignon medium-rare and it was perfect. It melted in my mouth. As side dishes we decided to share the mash potatoes and asparagus. I really enjoyed the champagne butter with the crispy Parmesan bread that was served as well. Their wine list is great. If you like wine, this is a fantastic place to visit.  The staff was great. They messed up our bill but fixed right away when we told them. They were extremely friendly during this process and even the manager came to our table.  My only recommendation is to add more light to the restaurant, one to get around better and not to bang your knees on booths, and two to see your food. I know that this romantically dark lighting is a thing for steakhouse but it would be nice to see what your are enjoying.  A great place for a date or to enjoy a classier evening out with friends/family."}
{"text":"What's not to love about Flemings!! Everytime I go to a new location I pretty much get what I expected. Great food, great service, upscale location... I am on their email marketing list so every month I get some really good dining offers and try to take them up on it at least once. This time it was Filet, Lobster stuffed shrimp, Salad and appetizer for just $32.95. Great price for a great meal."}
{"text":"Husband and I chose to have Date night this past Friday here at Fleming's. We had a gift card so that helped with the bill. We've eaten there a handful of times and have never been disappointed.   I ordered the chef's special. Bacon wrapped filet with 4 shrimp. $64.95. Hubz had the 12 oz mail filet. We had the shrimp/scallop small plate-delish. Shared asparagus and lobster Mac n cheese-amazing.   My bacon wrapped filet was definitely \"weird\". There was a large piece of jelly like fat smack dab in the middle. It was actually gross. Everything else was fine. Not sure we'll be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Well, what can I say.  Flemings is a chain steakhouse, but they do try hard.  Sometimes a bit too hard.  You know you're at a chain from the quality of service.  Don't get me wrong, the service is very nice most of the time, but it's clear they do peppy training seminars catering to midwestern diners and the whole thing comes off a bit like TGI Fridays.  Once in awhile servers there are not the friendliest; they seem to have a hard time taking a moderate line of just being courteous and efficient.  Most of the time however, the service is good-natured.  At least they don't wear flare, like at Ruth's Chris on the West side.  So yes, if you're in Madison and you like swanky (if corporate) steakhouses, why not?"}
{"text":"Dined here last night with my sisters for dinner to take advantage of the $40 dining credit offered via email. I had also purchased a $100 gift card online and it came with a $20 bonus gift card!  We ordered a Caesar salad, the petite filet mignons, Fleming's signature potatoes and for dessert, the hot lava chocolate cake!  Everything was soooo delicious!!! Our steaks and potatoes were cooked perfectly...best steak ever!  Dessert was heavenly! Service was absolutely amazing from beginning to end. We will definitely return again."}
{"text":"We love our experience there but the food....amazingly delicious!!! The chocolate lava cake is the best ive ever had."}
{"text":"This weekend, we had our second visit to this location. I know this can be a pricey establishment, but we have NEVER been to a restaurant, where every item we ordered, was over-the-top amazing! We have tried their bone-in ribeye (fabulous!), filet medallion small plate, filet mignon, NY strip with peppercorns, calamari, ahi tuna, tenderloin carpaccio, caesar salad and more! All of it...INCREDIBLE and worth every penny! Perfect for a special occasion, Flemings is more than an experience, it's a memory, because you will be talking about your meal for a long time.  Btw...if you just want to try it without breaking the bank, I hear their happy hour is the way to go!"}
{"text":"Writing this review after the third time going to this location. The first time was a couple years ago for a birthday dinner and everything was delicious. I've had better steak elsewhere but it was a good night out. Second time was last week when the family & I tried their happy hour. 4:30-7 in the bar/lounge area everyday. The drinks & most of the food on happy hour were amazing!!! So good. Right away I told my boyfriend, I can't wait to go back with him. Best calamari I've ever had!  The third time was earlier tonight. My family loved their happy hour so much we decided to take my mom there for her birthday dinner. They had some really good specials going on. Surf & turf with an a small app & dessert for $65 (my dad & I got that) & a rib eye with a salad, side, and dessert for $35 (my mom got that). We also ordered another side & my dad had a beer. When the steaks came out, I didn't even have to say anything because our server was right there when I cut into my filet. I had asked for medium rare and it was well done. My dad's filet was also over cooked so both were taken back to be remade. My mom's steak came out perfect & we patiently waited for ours to come back while we ate the sides we had ordered. Not only did they remake our steaks, but they remade our sides for us. Which was completely unnecessary  but we took them home. When the steaks came back out they were perfect & delicious. We never once were rude or demanded free stuff. When it was time for us to pay the manager came over & said we had no tab because of the mistake. No tab!? I maybe thought they'd take one entree off but to have our $180 bill taken care of? It shows flemings really cares about their customers and having them back & after that amazing service - we definitely will be back. Wish I could remember the server & the manager because they deserve a shout out!"}
{"text":"Had dinner with my wife this past Saturday.  She ordered the Cobb salad  with filet and lobster.  She said it was very yummy. I ordered the shrimp scampi which was also yummy.  We shared the mushrooms and were too full for dessert.  This was our second time at a Flemings and each time our meal was fantastic."}
{"text":"We hosted our daughters wedding  reception at Fleming's.  What a beautiful experience.  Leslie and Tana coordinated everything with my daughter and I.  The food was perfect, the food was exceptional as well as the service.  Everything was 1st class.  Wonderful experience.  Diana"}
{"text":"This is definitely my go to steakhouse. Let me start off by talking about their butter- it's amazing. Honestly, it's a huge reason I keep coming back. They give you three different unique flavors of butter/breD before your meal all of which are amazing. The steaks are mouth watering and same goes for the seafood."}
{"text":"This updated review is for their lava cake only! We got to come back a couple days after our first visit and we had ordered the lava cake for dessert! Deliciousness! Melty chocolately not overly sweet moist cake with aweome ice cream! I definitely recommend this dessert for anyone that goes to Flemings.   My filet wasn't as awesome as the first time, some tough pieces to chew through, but I still loved the Fleming's Potatoes! We also got the sauteed spinach instead of the creamed spinach and I liked it 10 times more.   Service was better this time around, but they weren't extremely busy for a Wednesday night! I will definitely be back for Happy Hour and Lava Cake!"}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday and it was just an amazing experience. I've never been in such a classy establishment with great staff always making sure we were ok. They greeted me wishing me a happy birthday and surprised me with some sweets at the end. Food was delicious and drinks were on par. For my first time dining there it was perfect, it definitely won't be my last!"}
{"text":"It's OK.  We had a GC so t'was the only reason as to why we wanted to come in and check it out and came in during HH, so we thought we were set. BUT, when I called in double check the time of HH, the female on the phone failed to mention that it was only at the bar. Thanks, trick.  Service was great but I wasn't a fan of the atmosphere. I HATE low lighting, I mean, I get it, it's romantic and all that cheesy, shmeesy stuff, but can I at least see the menu?  After our eating here, I would have rather have gone to Morton's or even Ruth's Chris. It was just an overall disappointment on the flavor. Portions, presentations were ok but the flavor was a thumbs down experience.  Nope, not coming back."}
{"text":"We went for a birthday dinner. Service and food was amazing! I did not love the ambiance of the restaurant, to dark for my liking, but won't stop me from going back. Might try another location next time."}
{"text":"This review is for the happy hour, because quite frankly we couldn't afford to eat at this place otherwise. The happy hour runs until 7PM at the bar daily I believe.   We weren't sure what to expect being that it was a Steakhouse, but after scoping out Herbs and Rye's happy hour, I was kind of expecting a similar looking place. Kind of mediocre outside but nice inside. This was not like that.  Fleming's is a very nice upscale steakhouse, to the point that when we walked in we were like wow...are we underdressed? Was that a ferrari parked out front?   But thanks to Lisa H's recommendation of this place, we went in and sat down at the bar (the only place happy hour is). It was Friday night about 6:30, and there was only one bar table left, so we got a little lucky on that.  Their happy hour is 5 appetizers for $6, 5 cocktails for $6, 5 wines for $6 and a few items a la carte (or as they call it, bar la carte).  We ordered:  Crispy Pork Belly Baked Brie Salt and Pepper Shrimp Roasted Mushroom Ravioli  and two Sam Adams IPA's to wash it down.  Each item is six bucks (they also have a burger that is $6 too, that must be the best value on there!)  The pork belly was delicious, but minimalist. It came with a little bit of what looked like grits, and something else I didn't recognize.  The mushroom ravioli was 3 raviolis covered in sauce, again, not a big dish, but WOW was it good. One of the best sauces I've tasted! A must try in my opinion.  The baked brie was also delicious because it was in a perfectly cooked croissant pastry, and came with apple pieces and greens, with walnuts on top of the pastry. All of those flavors combined with perfectly melted cheese (and plenty of it) made it an incredible dish.  The salt and pepper shrimp was also really tasty with a tempura like light fry on it. It also came with fried asparagus in the bowl.   The Sam Adams were pretty good, not a fan of IPA's, but at 6 bucks for 2...I'll sure as heck drink em!  One of the best parts of the dinner was the server Paul. He was SO friendly, seriously one of the best servers I've ever had (and I feel like I've been eating out professionally for at least 10 years). He was so unbelievably polite and courteous, and just made the dinner so much nicer. He was on par with some of the servers in michelin starred restaurants, just impeccable.   All in all, for 30 bucks plus tip, we got to try 4 extremely extremely well made dishes, had a beer, and had a beautiful atmosphere around us. At 15 bucks per person, with so much perfectly cooked variety, I can't help but give this place a perfect 5 stars."}
{"text":"Been coming here for 7-8 years or more. Never thought about checking on Yelp but this is one of our favorite places and definitely a place we go for a nice night out and special occasions. We love bringing friends here as well.  I can't say enough about the great personalized service from the food runners and hosts to the servers and management.  They never miss a beat all the way to the point of knowing our server and food preferences.  Try it you'll love it and feel like family just like we do!"}
{"text":"Absolutely superb! My husband and I normally go to Flemings on special occasions only. Reason quite frankly is the prices. When we come here its normally $200 & up.Which we don't mind paying for on special occasions! But tonight was different. I had received an email from Flemings advertising their Sunday Prime Rib Dinner Special. I had mentioned it to my husband and even he was skeptical about the price and what you get for it. We decided to try it. I made reservations and when we arrived they were running behind, so we sat at the bar and had drinks. My cocktail was amazing just right! It was during happy hour and the bartender didn't skimp on quality or taste!  She was also very friendly! In fact everyone at Flemings is very friendly and attentive from the hostess to the bust boys!  We had an amazing dinner, and at $29.95 per person, you really can't beat it! Deals like this,will make us go back to Flemings just because and not just for special occasions!"}
{"text":"I went here with my girl and was very disappointed. She had the chicken, bland in taste, she didn't even want to take it home but I did so the dog could eat it. I had the filet mignon with asparagus which was a big let down as well, not quite warm and the portion looked like I got the last one in stock along with maybe 2 pieces of the asparagus. We were asked if we would like some more bread to go with our meals and we said yes please but  the bread never came. The worst part was the service, our waiter was to concerned flirting with the girl at the big table next to us so we were left to choke down our meals with no refreshing beverage. I would expect this from an ihop but honestly we have had better service at an ihop, At-least once a month we go to a new high end steak house and are always happy with our experience but II am so glad we found yelp to forewarn  anybody thinking of giving this place a shot, skip it. Not worth the buck twenty"}
{"text":"By far one of THE best steakhouses in LV.  The bone in ribeye, Flemings  potatoes, creamed corn and spinach is so good!  On Sundays they have a price fix prime rib special that comes with salad and dessert that is a great value.   This is the place we always choose to celebrate very special family events and holidays.  We have also had Flemings host large parties for us and they do a great job."}
{"text":"I live in Summerlin made a reservation for 6pm on a Sunday night. Was at the restaurant with my family 5 min before our reservation. I was told it was going to be a 5 min wait. No biggie, well the 5 min turned into 28 min. My family stood there as 3 parties walked in after us and were seated immediately. Another party had a reservation like us and were told that they were going to receive a free appetizer for their wait, I was not told that. (Not that it would have made a difference) The small lobby was backed up with people, so someone didn't know what they were doing. We decided to leave and drive all the way to the Flemings by the strip instead of giving our money to this location. When you make a reservation you expect to be seated within a timely manner, not act as if it was call ahead seating at Applebee's considering our bill for 4 will be well over $200. If you are planning a reservation at this place think again. Can't even rate the food because we never made it that far. Didn't want to chance the food and service being as poor as our first impression. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Best Prime Rib dinner I've ever had in my entire life!! Wow is that too big of a statement? The Prime Rib dinner here puts every Prime Rib Roast dinner I've ever attempted to shame! And I'm the official Prime Rib cook for every single holiday event in my family. That's a lot of Prime Rib cooking under my belt. But here at Fleming's, I would rather just go out to eat here and save myself all the hassle.   For $29, I feel like I just stole from Fleming's. 3 course meal! Any Sides? Any Desert? Prime Rib that is melt in your mouth tender and juicy that you thought you just died in beef heaven.  I should be ashamed of myself for enjoying so much for costing so little."}
{"text":"It doesn't get any better than this in Vegas (well, it actually does, but at least we don't have to go all the way to the Strip).  Service is always exceptional and the food perfectly prepared.  We're always looking forward to our next visit before we've even left. Oh, and the kids love it!"}
{"text":"Been to this location on 4 occasions and definitely is twice the better restaurant than the Town Square location. Our server Maya was as courteous as can be and the Bone-in Ribeye is one of the greatest steaks to cross my pallet. Thanks for making a special celebration that much more enjoyable."}
{"text":"We had dinner with another couple here on August 4th and my prime rib  had the consistency of liver. I ate most of it thinking I was imagining it and  it didn't even taste like prime rib but we hadn't seen these friends in a year  and I didn't want to make a big deal out of it. I asked my friend after she  finished her own prime rib if she felt it was the same to her and she said she had the same. As the gentlmen at the table overheard us, they tasted both of ours and agreed that it was \"injected\" or \"old\" beef.  I'm sick thinking about it.  Now I wish I had spoken up!  I rarely eat steak and this was a special occasion. I endured  old/injected meat. NEVER coming back here! And this was after a $40 cab ride  from our hotel. NOT worth it.  Our waiter was great though, so there is the plus along with our company."}
{"text":"The onion rings were amazing.  Crisply and thick.   The mac n' cheese was great too.  The creamed spinach was perfect.    I highly recommend you split a steak and get more sides.   Once again an amazing experience."}
{"text":"An update: I returned to Fleming's in October 2016 and was quite impressed, so I have updated my review from 2 to 4 stars. (It's not 5 stars because the first time I got my entree, the meat was overcooked. I had ordered medium rare and what arrived was well done. However, the entree was quickly replaced with the correct temperature steak, even faster than I had expected.)   Service was excellent, our table was comfortable, and the food was delicious. I had the prime rib (Sunday only) special, which had one price for entree, salad, side dish, and dessert, which I thought was quite the deal, particularly since I have enough leftovers to make another meal! We'll come back again the next time we're celebrating.  The sides were shoestring potatoes (my husband's choice - and I like them much better than the steak fries they used to serve) and roast mushrooms, which were delicious. A great blend of different types in herbs and garlic, well-seasoned. We ordered one of the salads with an item left off, and it came exactly as ordered."}
{"text":"Love the place. My favorite steakhouse. Great food, great staff."}
{"text":"Food was really good, just a little on the high side for what you got. You pay the same as you would at a Ruth Chris, but don't get the same experience. If I'm trying to impress someone, I get a bigger bang for my buck at other high end steak houses."}
{"text":"We're not big steak eaters at all, but when we got snail mail from Fleming's with a $50 gift card inside - we have no idea how or why! - we figured might as well go for it.    I made a reservation for 8:00 p.m. on Friday just a couple of hours earlier.  Our table wasn't ready at 8, but we were seated not long after that by a very friendly and cheerful hostess, and the service went uphill from there.  As soon as we placed our drink orders we were treated to the bread basket - a loaf of seed-crusted bread with two flavored butters.  Too bad, 'cause it was all too good and I ate too much of it!  We shared a Fleming's salad, and I forgot to ask for the dressing on the side.  The kitchen split it for us and the salad wasn't drowning in dressing, which was delicious and not overly-vinegary.  I try to avoid eating a lot of meat, so I ordered the New Zealand Baby lamb chops from the small plates part of the menu, and hubby ordered the Newport Filet Mignon, which came with Fleming's potatoes.  My lamb chop plate had three baby chops and two thick polenta fries.  The fries were outstanding, but I was having a tough time with the tough and flavorless chops.  When the waiter came over to inquire about the food, I wasn't going to say anything, because one bite out of one little chop made it look like I'd already eaten half the meal!  But my face must have given it away, because he persisted, and then INsisted that he get me something else.  He let me keep the delicious polenta, and I ordered the sliced filet mignon, also from the small plates side.  Four small slices of perfectly medium-rare steak, each one sitting on an oval mound of porcini risotto, were enough to make this non-steak-lover feel as if she'd gone to culinary heaven.  The steak was like BUTTAH, and so delicious that I'm craving it even as I write this.  I don't even like risotto, but that stuff was outstanding.  And so was the filet my husband had, and his potato accompaniment was out-of-this-world richness personified.  Despite the fact that our check would have been very small compared to all the other tables around us even if we didn't have that gift card, our server, Ryan, was totally attentive and never once conveyed any kind of attitude.  Even more astounding, they took the lamb chops off the bill, as they should have, and comped the sliced filet!  That, my friends, is the hallmark of a good restaurant.  During the meal a hostess walked around distributing $25 gift cards to each table good for a future visit.  Unfortunately, it has a mid-March expiration, and I'll be out of town for an extended period, so it won't do us any good unless my husband decides to do a solo performance.  But we definitely will go back."}
{"text":"The food and service was great at Fleming's. I would go back to it again."}
{"text":"I live a block away from this Establishment and have dined here hundreds of times.  My review is long overdue.  So Let me break it down for you.   Food:  5 Stars.  The food is exceptional.  The steaks are always cooked to the temperature you desire.  Their fresh seafood is always delicious.  Chipotle MAC AND CHEESE is sinful.  Other people talk about how expensive this place is but the truth is they have something for everybody.  If you aren't looking to spend hundreds of dollars on dinner they have a bar menu with several more affordable options.   The Service:  5 Stars.  The servers are highly trained.  They always have managers in the restaurant.  They go above and beyond most fine dining establishments to make sure your experience is a good one.  If a problem does arise they are very quick to fix it."}
{"text":"Celebrated Valentine's Day at Flemings and has such a great experience.  We had reservations and didn't wait at all to be seated and the server was great and checked on us often .  We had the prime rib dinner and it was delicious and included salad , a side and a dessert. So much food and my prime rib was cooked perfectly.    Because it was Valentine's Day they also gifted us with a $25 gift card to come back and eat."}
{"text":"Really as good as steak places get.  I had the filet minon and a side of the mac and cheese.  This was really the turning point for me loving mac and cheese from restaurants.  Would would think you could turn $1 box easy dinner into a fabulous side at a nice restaurant.  The ambiance is great, super fancy, super expensive.  You get what you pay for and at this place soooo true.  So delicious.  If I have the money to spend on a great steak, I know I can get that here.  The waiters are very nice too.  Love great service and a great meal."}
{"text":"I went here with my girlfriend for Valentine's Day, and it was amazing. It is the true definition of \"melt in your mouth\" salmon and steak! Almost everything was on point from the food to the \"buzz\" in the restaurant. Only drawback I would have to say is that the service could be a better. Even though it was Vday, we went later at night when it was not too busy; the service was still lacking. For example, the speed of the service was subpar, and we were brought the wrong order of wine.. However, it is still worth another visit."}
{"text":"I love to fine dine whenever I can. My boyfriend and I decided to go to Flemings on Valentines Day ( made reservations way in advanced) and the dinner did not disappoint. Easy tied for the best meal Ive ever had with Flemings competitor Johnny's Italian Steak House. I honestly cannot decide who is better. They both are THAT good.   My BF and I both order different cuts of steak. He had a ribeye and I had the NY Strip. Because the steaks doesn't come with a side, we shared an order of fries. Honestly, the steaks alone were enough because they both were gigantic. They had so much natural flavor and beyond this world tender.   Before our meal came out, we were served bread as a starter and we ordered some shrimp from the menu.  I believe you get 5 medium sized sautéed shrimp for roughly $14. Even though we didnt get a lot in quantity, the quality was superb.   For dessert, we order this short bread cookie with vanilla ice cream and homemade freshly whipped cream. The whipped cream alone was good enough to eat solo. I have never tasted anything remotely close to being THAT fresh. I could not stop talking about how good it was. Same with the cookie.   Service was top notch and the drinks were very strong.   This is a fantastic place to go to do adults. Even if there isn't a special occasion, dinning here comes highly recommended. There was not one thing I could complain about. All around a 5 out of 5 star restaurant and experience.   Yes, they are very, very expensive but that's the price you pay for a 5 star restaurant."}
{"text":"Ate here for my birthday recently with family and friends, it was amazing hands down a good meal all around and staff!!!"}
{"text":"For a giant corporate-owned chain, this place brings the goods. I like the fact that I can expect a great meal at any location.  The wines by the glass menu is quite large, which is nice if there are only two of you and she drinks white.  They frequently have special promotional menus that include a side, salad, steak and desert.  My only complaint is that they don't have a Hendo location."}
{"text":"With so many reviews talking how spendy it is, plus the likelihood of a gorge-fest, I was a little apprehensive. While I was super curious to try the bone-in ribeye, at 20oz, I thought that's too big -- plus what room would be available to try much else?  Happily, we came on a Sunday, which turns out to have a perfect $40 special. Available only on Sundays, you get the Prime Rib, plus a salad, side and dessert of your choice !!! Wow. This was so the way to go for me. 12oz of meat is plenty. It was delicious and juicy, and served at the medium-rare requested. (I wavered a bit if I wanted it closer to rare --- as a result, the server brought it out, with the center actually more rare. Toward the end, I sheepishly asked to have the remainder fired up a bit more. Yay.)  Started with the Fleming salad, which sounded up my alley, and refreshing. (Candied walnuts, dried cranberries, tomatoes, onions, herbed crostini, lemon vinaigrette). The side I chose was Fleming's Potatoes (served with cream, jalapeños and cheddar cheese). While I thought that might all be too heavy, it actually hit the spot, and was a great complement to the table - and specifically, my entree.  Along the way, our server (he, and the entire team, I felt, were outstanding with their friendly attention to detail), suggested a couple different wines that were great selections. A pinot grigio at the beginning, and a nice red (Oberon) to accompany my Prime Rib.  To finish, I secured the Chocolate Lava Cake. While I liked it, I was not blown away. Perhaps because the inside 'Lava' was lukewarm. Like a heartier chocolate souffle. The CLC has much to like about it, and maybe a hotter center would fix it, but as a crowning finish to the meal, well, I was happy but not ecstatic. Or, maybe just weary from all that food !  Overall, I loved our meal here. The food, the wine, the beautiful room and the expert service all made for a lovely evening. And, having the opportunity to try so many things with their Sunday special made me, perhaps, well-rounded in the best sense of the phrase."}
{"text":"I really had my hopes up on this one and i was pretty let down. Now the customer service was great but the food not the best i have had. Probably will not go back."}
{"text":"Good not great. For the price, you're better off somewhere else. I ordered the Chilean sea bass and was unimpressed. It's floating in an unflavorable broth. Sadly the most tasty part of the meal was the appetizers and sides. (Crab cake, salad with blueberries, Flemings potatoes and Thai green beans) all were worth getting.  But husband got the wagyu steak and lobster, ehhhh."}
{"text":"Jackie and her crew always do a great job.   I've been dining at this location for ten years and I've never had a bad meal or horrible service. The runners and bussers are awesome and Rory, our server, is the real reason why we keep coming back. He's always professional and knows exactly what we want every time.   Hats off to the cooks and chef! Remodel is great too."}
{"text":"We had an amazing dinner for my husband Bday on Sunday. Jones Tidy was our server and his knowledge, recommendations, friendly attitude and smile made it a great experience. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Last  night my boyfriend and I ate in the bar with some family friends.  I'm in my 30's, he's in his 40's - our friends were 67 and 85 years old.  Not many places you can go that wow that broad of age range, but Fleming's did it.  The happy hour prices are so reasonable and they don't jip you on portion size.   Great wine, ahi, calamari, carpaccio, burgers, great service.  Our server, Cindy, provided the best service we've had on or off the strip."}
{"text":"One of our favorite date night experiences is using the iPad and pairing our wines. This was our first time at this location (normally we go to the Town Square Flemings)...must say, we prefer Town Square.   Of course, overall the steak was delicious and so was my lobster tail. What was disappointing were our side dishes - we had creamed corn, Mac and cheese, and the Flemings potatoes...and it seemed like they were baked or had been sitting out. We also preferred the ambiance that TS offers as well. Needless to say, we probably won't be visiting this location again - Town Square is our spot. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, service a little slow, maybe because they were busy, ordered the prime rib, the presentation was better than the prime rib, it was bland, could of used more Au jus, friend ordered petite filet mignon w/lobster in which she enjoyed. All and all it was a good culinary experience."}
{"text":"Disappointing, unfortunately. The food was OK, but not that great (at least compared to other steakhouse such as Houston's steakhouse). The server was very welcoming but was pushing a bit too much. For example, she asked several times if we wanted to take the molten cake for desert and insisted. We decided to try it and it wasn't that great (you could taste that the fruits were just unfrozen while the rest of cake wasn't)."}
{"text":"I've come here several times and each time was exceptional service, food, and experiences. There's a very large variety to choose from and everything I've had was top notch. Mothers Day has a really nice preselected menu arranged as well as other special days. You won't be disappointed, probably one of the best places to go in Vegas."}
{"text":"Super yummy! For me personally a small place was plenty to eat. I didn't need a full entree plate. The mashed potatoes are soooo yummy. Definitely an expensive place to eat but a good place to try for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Happy hour; great atmosphere, service, and drink specials.  I was pumped, but hungry, then... Marginal to bad food.  Carpaccio was OK, calamari was a big glob of yuck.  The waiter did not seemed surprised when we sent it back virtually untouched.  We were still hungry, viewed other diners meals and were not tempted, so opted to home and eat leftovers. Not what I expected from Flemings, even at happy hour."}
{"text":"I was here for a group event. The food was fantastic. I got the filet mignon, medium/medium rare and it was perfect. They also have vegetarian options too!"}
{"text":"Wonderful, beautiful food with unlimited free wine! Eating dinner that was beautifully served. Servers so kind. 4 old broads eating dinner with a 22 year old pharmacy student is priceless!  I had a great time, but still missed the beautiful man at home! Great day!"}
{"text":"I really wish I had know about this place sooner! I am absolutely in love with this restaurant. I came here for a \"girls date\" a few nights ago expecting an Outback-like experience, but I was blown away! The two places aren't even comparable!   Bread/butter: Probably the most flavorful butter I have ever tasted! I normally am very Anti-Chain restaurants because I feel they lack the little extra flairs that the strip restaurants have. I was blown away by the tomato b  Wine: Reasonable. I just had a single glass and the server didn't seem upset about losing a bottle sale.   Brie: If you eat ANYTHING here, do not miss this brie. It was absolutely perfect.   Filet App: I had It cooked rare and it came out perfect. It is about 3oz paired with a mushroom pasta.   Potatoes: Probably the best scalloped I have ever had.   Asparagus: Ive had better... It was slightly not-hot when It arrived.   Dessert: Meh.. Not so awesome. We tried the Walnut chocolate pie and it was lacking some seriously flair. I felt that it tasted old and the crust was wayyyy too hard.   Service: Probably the best service I have had in awhile. I know that servers don't love seeing two girls in their sections normally because they assume we wont tip, BUT our server was terrific. We tipped him accordingly and he seemed happy. His back server was also really helpful and the manager even stopped by to make sure we loved our food.   I cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We went here for the 1st time for our valentine's date. They had a valentine's menu so we went ahead and go for it. The main entree was lobster tail and filet mignon. I ordered a medium on my filet. The starter was great but when the main entree come. My meal was a little overcooked. My filet almost feels like a well done and my lobster tail was a little overcooked and it was dry. I didn't bother to complain as the service was pretty slow."}
{"text":"SO happy my mom asked me to give this Fleming's location another chance. Over the past year, they have really made some drastic improvements: the first being the smiling hostesses.  My experience was much better than the last time but that could be because we were in the dining room this time. The dining room provided nothing less than a five star experience.   The food was flawless and my taste buds were beyond satisfied. Fleming's, will you please share the secret to your ice cream?  Taylor R was our server and although she was a sweetheart and did a wonderful job, our experience was really based on our busser, Gil. He was AWESOME. Never was my water glass less than half full and he was always willing to grab something if we needed it. He works with passion and is truly looking out for the customers best interest. Servers would be nowhere without their bussers and I really think that Gil's service should be recognized.   Can't wait for my next visit to Fleming's - hopefully the Town Square location that should be opening soon!"}
{"text":"OK so I went back with my father and this time they really hit it out of the park. Service and food were excellent! Thank you to Jackie for making us feel like we were special and im sorry to say I cant rember my servers name, but he was excellent. We both enjoyed our meal and wanted to thank Flemings for coming through! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We LOVE this place!! Every time we come to Vegas we try to come here.Alex is A Great server!"}
{"text":"There was an earwig in our salad. I never experienced something like this. About half way through eating the salad an earwig was calling through it. In case you don't know what that it is. It's like a cockroach but with pinchers. I almost wish I could've taken a picture to show you all but I was in such shock that I called the nearest person over to just take the plate away from me.   So you can imagine what they would try and do for us so we wouldn't come to posting this review.   Well they gave us one free salad.   A $200 ticket for 4 disgusted people who just saw a roach like bug literally about to go from the plate into their mouth is astonishing. I was so mortified at the time that I was just glad they took the freaking plate away but the more that I think about it.... they really just discounted a $10 salad to save their reputation.   2 stars for effort but as a franchise business they really should've done more. It makes me curious what process they skipped that the bug had a chance to be in that salad. Did they not wash the lettuce ?"}
{"text":"An overall great experience for my wife's 50th birthday.  We started with the seafood tower and seared ahi.  The ahi was quite bland and the tower was served with only cocktail sauce and mayo, some drawn butter for the lobster and crab would have been nice.  This would have brought the rating down to 4 stars, but the servers (Marco and buddy) were outstanding!  I'm pretty sure the water glasses never got below half full at any point.  The dry aged New York strip was excellent, as was the filet.  The Fleming's potatoes were very flavorful. A great place for special occasions, pricey but good."}
{"text":"Wow! Wow! And wow. The thing I love best about restaurants is CONSISTENCY, and this place has been for nearly 15 years. The food and service is what it takes for the the 15 years. Congrats to the operator and every staff member. I've lived in Las Vegas for 30 years and I've never been this impressed. The food is awesome, but what makes me most happy about spending 600+ and tipping 30% on top of that is that everything was f$&\"omg was PERFECT! Now the place wasn't packed, so I get that there was enough time to pay attention to detail, but I can't take away that it was BEAUTIFULLY on point! Thank you to all!"}
{"text":"Dramatic and low lit atmosphere. New York steak was solid. Great service. Spicy Thai green beans and mashed potatoes. Chilean sea bass wasn't bad."}
{"text":"The WaunaQueen and I dropped by Fleming's on a Sunday evening for a glass of wine, a couple of appetizers and a great view of the sunset over the west side of Madison with a couple of former co-workers.  As mentioned in other reviews, there is a subset of items from the drink and appetizer menu available for $6 between 5pm and 7pm.  We ordered a couple glasses of the Vinedos Terranoble Sauvignon Blanc, the baked brie and the French onion soup just before the end of happy hour.  The wine came recommended by a wine blog I follow and it was the right choice for the setting and a decent value at $6 a glass.    The baked brie was a disappointment - just brie baked in a less- than-crispy puff pastry shell.  The cheese lacked that earthy flavor and needed a boost, whether from a sauce or some added herbs.  The gala apples served with the dish started to brown by the time we received our plate.  The French onion soup ($12) also disappointed.  This dish is good test for a restaurant.  It takes time and skill to coax the natural sweetness out of the onion.  Rush the dish and it is bland, cook the onions with too much heat and they become bitter.  Cook the onions slowly at low heat and you are rewarded with a wonderful caramelization that provides deep, rich flavor.  The Fleming's version of this soup was on the bland side of the spectrum with its thin broth.  The baked gruyère and parmesan cheese topping was well executed and added a much needed punch of flavor.  Our group enjoyed the patio setting at Flemings.  Despite sitting near the bustling intersection of University and Midvale, there was very little traffic noise to interrupt our conversation.  Our server was efficient, but less than enthusiastic.  At happy hour prices, it fit the A-OK definition of a three star rating primarily due to the setting and the wine list.  Outside of happy hour, I probably will go elsewhere to find more satisfying food options.  UPDATE: After posting this review, I did get a message from the restaurant manager, apologizing that my happy hour experience with them fell short.  Her message was sincere,  appreciating that I took the time to provide feedback.  I then spoke with the manager on the phone and because of that positive interaction, I do plan on returning to Flemings.  It's a favorable sign when a restaurant uses feedback from their patrons to improve."}
{"text":"One of chain restaurant that I actually enjoy their steak. The chocolate Molton cake was to die for!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Fleming's and make a special trip out to this particular location whenever I am in Las Vegas. It is a considerable distance from the strip but well worth the trip, especially for the happy hour. Happy hour is from 5pm-7pm 7 days a week. There are five wines, five martinis (with premium liquor,) 5 appetizers, and the prime burger with cheese and bacon for a mere $6 each.  I have been to this Fleming's several times and have always sat at the bar. The service is always excellent and the food and drink quality is top notch. Here is what we ordered:  Appletinis - the drinks are strong without being too boozy tasting, and thankfully they are not cloyingly sweet like some flavored martinis. The appletini is made with Grey Goose ($6)  White cosmos - Ketel One, peach schnapps, white cranberry juice, and lime juice garnished with dried blueberries. This drink is light and fruity with a nice fragrant sweetness ($6)  There were 4 of us and we had prime burgers all around, and at $6 each these are quite the bargain! It is a huge burger with your choice of cheese (2 of us had bleu cheese the other 2 had swiss,) and alot of bacon, served with onion rings or fries. We all ordered the burgers medium rare and they were perfectly cooked, juicy, and delicious.  Seared ahi tuna - lightly seared but served cold with a spicy mustard sauce. Quoting one of my dining partners, \"This is amazing. I could eat this all day, every day.\"  Beef carpaccio - paper thin slices of heavenly raw beef filet served with a creamy creole mustard sauce and cheesy toast. OMG is all I can say. I have this every time I am in a Fleming's and it is always amazing.  We could not resist ordering dessert and had 2 delicious creme brulees. The best part of the desserts at Fleming's is that they are served with a bowl (or a trough if you ask nicely) of fluffy and decadent chantilly cream. While quite amazing we pretty much abandoned the creme brulee and started eating the chantilly cream out of the trough with our spoons while making loud \"nom, nom, nom\" sounds.  Other items on the  $6 happy hour menu:  APPETIZERS: SWEET CHILI CALAMARI WICKED CAJUN BARBECUE SHRIMP JUMBO LUMP CRAB CAKES, Red Pepper Sauce   COCKTAILS: FLEMING'S CLASSIC, Ketel One Vodka MARGATINI, Gran Centenario Anejo Tequila TROPICAL MARTINI, Malibu Coconut Rum  5 WINES BY THE GLASS: PINOT GRIGIO, Redbank, Australia CHARDONNAY, Glen Carlou, South Africa PINOT NOIR, Mark West, California PETITE SIRAH, Vinum, California CABERNET SAUVIGNON, 14 Hands, Washington   As I mentioned earlier the service was excellent. Our bartender was alone behind the bar yet was able to give great service and make great drinks for us while also producing cocktails for a very crowded bar and dining room. Her bright and sincere smile never left her lips and our glasses were never dry. As soon as our glasses were half empty she asked if we needed more cocktails. We didn't have to wait very long for anything. Our food came out of the kitchen amazingly fast and at the correct temperature. The service was extraordinary from the time the door was opened for us and we were greeted by the hostess until the time we were sincerely thanked and wished a good evening, and again had the door opened for us by the hostess. Fleming's is the perfect example of great food and great customer service, and this particular location does not disappoint."}
{"text":"I've to Flemings a handful of times now and have nothing but good things to say about it.  I love the decor and ambiance.  There booths are so comfortable and regardless of where you sit, I feel like it's still private enough.  I've had dinner in the bar, in a booth, at their big center table and on their patio and every time has been great.  Their staff is knowledgeable and courteous as well as attentive.  Their martinis are a little expensive but so so good.  I always go straight for their ahi tuna appetizer and the calamari.  These two things are so amazing, and consistent.  I love their french onion soup and their parmesan mashed potatoes.  I've had most of the menu and can say that everything they put out is really good and worth trying.  My favorite dessert is their creme brulee and fresh whipped cream...unbelievable.  Obviously spendy but what good steak joint isn't?"}
{"text":"Tonight my husband and I chose to eat at Flemings Steakhouse in Summerlin. What a nice evening we had. The food tonite was excellent. Every course was excellent. Not only was the food good but the quality was excellent. We have felt it was always good but the menu has changed a little and the server was top notch. Fun, knowledgeable, and was on top of everything. We like to eat early because it's quieter and more relaxed.  We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I am only rating the fantastic happy hour because that is all I had.  Delicious blueberry lemon drops for only $6.00!  We tried the inexpensive calamari and beef carpaccio, both delicious and heavy portions!  Both under $7.00!  Fantastic happy hour.  My only gripe is the atmosphere.  Inside, it's very dark for happy hour.  Outside, your noisy view is of University Ave."}
{"text":"Bone in rib eye is large the F17 sauce is marginable"}
{"text":"One of my favorite steakhouses thus far. I've tried Ruths Chris, Mortons & Mastros and still enjoy Flemings for its fine nuanced difference. I usually get their filet and various sides (Creamed spinach, corn, iceberg salad, etc) and haven't been disappointed.  The only better steakhouse I've encountered in Las Vegas was Prime at Bellagio and boy, that place is wonderful. Now that's a whole another review. ;)"}
{"text":"Excellent salad with filet.  Great shrimp cocktail.  Tasty wine and mixed drinks.  Awesome berries and cream for dessert.  Classy joint, just like all Flemings restaurants.  According to our server, they were unexpectedly busy for that day of the week and he was overly apologetic for slower than usual service and comped our beverage.  This is what makes a great restaurant."}
{"text":"We weren't familiar with Fleming's, but took a chance for Valentine's Day. In a word...AWESOME. Complimentary bread with two different spreads was superb. Then we had the mushroom ravioli appetizer and licked the plate clean. The wife and I each had a filet (I added the poached lobster with caviar) and it was honestly one of the best steaks I've had in a LONG time. Both cuts were beautifully cooked. The ticket times were a little bit long, so the manager (Kelsey?) came over without us asking and apologized and bought us a round of drinks. Just a great move on her part because she didn't have to do that, but it made the experience pretty much perfect. We ended with the molten cake and rolled ourselves out of there. We were only in Madison for the weekend, so we will definitely try their Chicago location!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good and the staff was great; however, the food seems a little over priced. I paid about $60 for a New York cut and there was a lot of fat on it. My wife really enjoyed her salmon and the bread was amazing. We would come her again."}
{"text":"My first time at Flemings for their Sunday brunch and my experience was an absolute pleasure!!! Not only was the food a hit but the service was out standing! Our waitress Bethany might have been the best server I've ever had. Definitely a must go if you haven't already.  P.s order the chicken and waffles"}
{"text":"I have been coming here since I can remember. I have never been disappointed by the service or the food. Even though my family is known by name, I can still confidently say that every customer, new or old, receives a wonderful dining experience. Their new recipe for the Caesar salad is sooooo good and their cheesecake is my favorite in town! Fleming's is good for brunch, dinner, and they even have a great happy hour! Their happy hour is definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"One evening last week, we had a great Happy Hour AND Fine Dining experience in this elegant, comfortable restaurant. We'll be back again and soon!  YELPIER DETAILS   Fleming's has an upscale ambience, good food, superb service and at a reasonable price. Its menus offer nice selections of food and beverage.  It also has a classy bar. However, this restaurant does NOT have a view, and could be slightly noisy when filled to capacity.  Yes, we had excellent dinners at Fleming's before, 2x, to be exact, since its sister restaurant right NEXT DOOR (Roy's) was closed recently - But this was the first time we came for its happy hour AND dinner. We enjoyed both!  We started our nice evening with happy hour over delicious apps (Pork Belly; Calamari) and tasty glasses of cab, at $6ea.   For our dinner, we had Chef's Specials: Mahi, $37; Steak & Shrimp, $43; side of asparagus, $10.50. The fish was fresh and flavorful. The steak was tender and juicy but kind of small, the 3 shrimps were tiny and  slightly overcooked. For dessert we shared a wonderful Chocolate Lava Cake/Ice cream, $12.50 over great tasting coffee!  The serving staff for our happy hour and dinner were absolutely superb! Our waitress Monica and her crew were friendly and helpful, attentive but not overbearing. The hostess was friendly and welcoming. She cheerfully welcomed guests at the start, and warmly said goodbye to them at departure.   However, as the restaurant was filled to capacity around 7pm, it was understandably a bit noisy. I would give it 5 Stars, if it had a view.   In short, we had a wonderful happy hour/dinner experience here, and will be back again for more and soon!   Nov 2013"}
{"text":"I have been to Fleming many times, but when it comes my birthday I don't want to go any where else but here from shrimp cocktails to crab cake and the main entree lamb racks and best steaks I just love this place.besides when Scott is your server you can't ask for more ."}
{"text":"Awesome nightly Happy Hour + delicious Prime Burger + Niki's excellent service + fancy eatery = 5 stars  Happy Hour ($6/item) nightly 5 - 7 pm at the bar   http://www.flemingssteakhouse.com/bar-menu-and-cocktails  Got here 5:05 pm on Tue/16 Apr: - Place supposedly opens at 5 pm but it was pretty busy at the bar when I got there at 5:05 pm (some patrons, regulars I'm guessing, already had drinks/food/etc) and since all the bar seats were occupied I sat at a table. - I waited about 5 min for a server but I think that's because it was fairly busy.  Once Niki, my server, got to my table and took my order everything was quick: martini arrival, food arrival, ice water refills... -  My order: 1) I loved the Prime Burger which had bacon & choice of 3 different cheeses (I opted for blue cheese) and (sweet potato?) french fries.  2) Thought the calamari was too oily/soggy but the portion size was large so I took the remainder to go.  3) Had the tasty Stoli Bombshell at only 99 calories, otherwise I would have opted for the 2 for $6 Blue Moon seasonal.   - The Prime Burger at $6 was a steal and will definitely order that again in the future, wouldn't  get the calamari again and the Stoli martini for $6 is a good deal.  ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// I like finding/getting/sharing deals so if you want 58% off ($70 off of $120 value) food/drinks at Fleming's/sister eateries (Outback, Bonefish, Carrabba's, Roy's), you can do this by 24 May 2013:  Steps: 1) You must have an AMEX (American Express) credit card - go to www.americanexpress.com and login to your credit card account - click \"My Offers\" - One of your AMEX cards (I used my AMEX Costco TrueEarnings card) you probably have this offer \"Fleming's...Spend $100 or more, Get $50 back\" so click \"Get Offer\" tab next to it - You'll get an e-mail saying your AMEX is loaded with the offer 2) Go to a Fleming's restaurant's bar area and purchase $100 gift card (do not purchase online) using that specific AMEX card 3) Fleming's will give you the $100 gift card and a \"$20 Bonus Card\" 4) AMEX will give you a $50 cash back statement credit for making that $100 purchase at Fleming's  Expiration Dates: - AMEX says 24 May 2013 is deadline to load offer & make the $100 purchase at Fleming's - Buy the $100 gift card by 16 June and Fleming's will give you the \"$20 Bonus Card\" - The \"$20 Bonus Card\" is \"Valid for redemption May 13th - July 15th, 2013\" - $100 card backside says \"This card can be redeemed at any of our restaurants in the United States\" so I think it can be used at Outback, Bonefish, Carrabba's, Roy's or Fleming's.   - \"$20 Bonus Card\" back reads \"Valid at any Bloomin' Brands restaurant\" which includes Outback, Bonefish, Carrabba's, Roy's and Fleming's.  a) Roy's Aloha Hour nightly 4:30 pm - 6:30 pm, $6/item   http://www.roysrestaurant.com/aloha_hour.asp    - I liked their $6 Wagyu Beef Sliders, Smoked Mahi Mahi Tacos, Beef Short Rib Tacos. b) Carraba's happy hour   $5/item  http://www.carrabbas.com/restaurant/locations/nv/las-vegas/las-vegas-w-charleston/index.aspx"}
{"text":"I had dinner here with a friend tonight... I have to say that i have been a fan of flemings for awhile...  I started with the crab cakes and the french onion soup... I liked both,,, too much filler for me on the crab cake, soup was good but how hard is french onion soup... I had a salad wedge,, it was delish and i was satisfied by it... The entree was the prime bone in rib eye, med rare.. It was very good and hit the spot, some people say you ruin the steak wit A1 but hey its my steak... I can never finish it so i usually have a nice meal later...The sides were a huge baked tater,, i couldnt finish it, it came home also, the mac and cheese was good,, for some reason i love stouffers mac and cheese... Dessert was the creme brulee,  i always get this everytime where its available,,, i really like how they do theirs...  Dinner for 2 can get well over 200 bucks so i treat this as a special occasion... I love their service and their food.. Flemings is always on my list of places to eat for a special dinner...."}
{"text":"Always friendly and fast service!  Whether you are sitting in the bar for a coctail & app or sitting in the dining area you will see everyone is enjoying themselves.  If ordering a filet ask for the center cut.  The house mash is great but what really keeps me coming back time after time is the tempura lobstaer and cajun shrimp starters.  Give me an order of those and a vodka martini and I would be in heaven!"}
{"text":"I feel that I need to preface this review by stating that I've visited some pretty swanky restaurants in my day, or I'm going to come off and some kind of unrefined rube.   When it comes to Fleming's I felt that they amped up the ridiculous service and lost the idea behind  a great restaurant. My wife took me here for my birthday which was very nice of her. She made a reservation and from that point on the hostess, server, and assistant manager all called us by name. OK, nice touch...whatever. Here's where it gets a little obnoxious, and bear in mind that I get it... There is something nice about being treated like an infant at a restaurant... (rolling eyes).  Upon entering the place, I counted 4 people that asked if we'd like our coats checked, ok thorough. Then we are escorted to the table and we are asked if we'd prefer a black napkin instead of white, really? Our server made it a point to refer to us by name during every encounter and at the end of the meal we got her card in case we'd like to request her next time.   Im not saying that any of this was unpleasant, but it's overdone... We got lobster tails and there was a guy who came over, referred to us by name and cut the meat from the shell. The manager came over twice to say hello and ask if everything was ok... OK ENOUGH!! Let me eat in peace!  My question is this, I'm trying to have a nice dinner with my wife and people are Constantly at our table! Do they really think we came to hang out with the staff? I realize that they are just doing their jobs but c'mon! if I wanted people running up to my table every few minutes, i'd eat with crazed children begging for tokens at Chuck E Cheese! (plus they have skee-ball)  The food was great, except that they cooked her steak wrong which is funny for such an overattentive staff. I think the manager apologized 13 times. To me, it's not a big deal but they were all running around apologizing. RELAX!  Water was filled, wine was great, bill was a little high but we knew that going in. Overall if you want a place to pamper you to death then you have it here. For me.. I can put my own napkin on my lap."}
{"text":"There are crazy options in Las Vegas for steak lovers such as myself. If that weren't the case, Fleming's might be a 5-star, favorite steakhouse of mine. It's still close and that counts for something. At the moment, they are running a $25 off promo for purchases $50 or more, as long as you make an online reservation. This expires in January I believe. I love the customer service here, as well as the close proximity to my house. The hostess was great, as well as the server and the awesome guy who brings out the food. He literally balanced at least 8 or 9 plates on one arm while bringing food out to a different table. I gotta thank Rob for suggesting this place, and for knowing about the crazy good deal going on.  As per the server Britney's suggestion, I ordered a $42 Medium Plus (apparently that's a thing) bone out Rib-Eye. It was pretty massive and very juicy. It was pretty much cooked to perfection, with a nice char on the outside. I am weening myself off more cooked steaks, it's not easy to do when you grow up on leathery well-done steaks (thanks Dad :P). I thought I loved my steaks well done, but chose to force myself to cook and order them medium well for a while now, for added juiciness and flavor. Now I might be on a Medium Plus kick for a while. I will never be at the point that Rob's at, ordering his filet Medium Rare. Yikes. But I tried a slightly more cooked piece of his filet, on the outer edge. It was delicious. I really like their parmesan bread, I can't say the same thing for their weird spreads that come with it. I wasn't a fan. I also tried one of the complimentary sauces they offer. It was the peppercorn, and it was delicious.   Once I dropped a subtle hint that we were celebrating Rob's B-day, they brought out a massive delicious piece of chocolate cake. It was a little rich, but that was mostly just the icing.   With the current promo, Fleming's is a no brainer. After January, I'm not 100% sure I'll be back on any kind of regular basis. It's basically the same price as the slightly better quality steakhouses. And there are way too many steakhouses here that I haven't yet tried. But we'll see, the customer service was outstanding, and it's really close and convenient. Oh and I'm gonna upload a few pics as well. I just want to note that I'm proud of myself for restraining from using any meat puns in this review. A pun-less review from me is pretty rare..... Oh, Dammit!"}
{"text":"My favorite steakhouse because they have my favorite dessert, CHOCOLATE LAVA CAKE! Takes 20 minutes to cook because the warm ooey gooey chocolatey goodness inside the cake. Served with two scoops of vanilla ice cream and crème fraiche.   We ordred the Prime Ribeye medium rare and it came out slightly dry. I don't know if it was because of the quality of meat or the way it was cooked but BF didn't want to send it back so we just ate it.  In addition to the ribeye, we ordered the roasted mushroom ravioli, fresh mozzarella and sweet tomato salad and sautéed spinach. All of their dishes are flavored heavily with butter, even the sautéed spinach, so it's not for the health conscious. But, it makes everything taste great!  The server was a tiny bit slow but maybe because she thought we were enjoying a leisurely meal she didn't want to interrupt us too often. But our waters were constantly being re-filled. A+ for that :)"}
{"text":"I have yet to find a steakhouse in Las Vegas that compares to Fleming's. We've been to countless steakhouses on the strip but nothing beats their ribeye. Their scalloped potatoes & jalapeño macaroni & cheese are so delicious! Despite how packed it is every time we go, service is always great!"}
{"text":"Fleming's was great! Although, we weren't in the mood to drink we were handed an iPad as a drink menu. I ordered the prime rib, my dad had the ribeye, and fiance had the filet mignon. Everyone was more than satisfied with their meals! Our waitress was so kind and patient with us as I'm extremely indecisive. We had cheesecake for dessert, which was pretty good.   I do plan on returning to Fleming's!"}
{"text":"Had a nice dinner for with my boyfriend here last night. The food was amazing! We both had the summer prixe fix menu, which included prawns as a starter (cooked and presented very nicely- with a fairly spicy sauce and small mandarin orange slices). The main course was filet minon with this delicious goat cheese mousse on top, as well as a piece of pecan-crusted salmon. The filet was wonderful, the salmon didn't blow me away. We also got the Fleming's signature potatoes and creamed spinach for sides. These are family style - can serve 3 to 4 people, so we couldn't finish it all. Also want to mention that I loved the bread, which they say is homemade, and the feta dipping sauce / butter to go with it.   We also had a bottle of wine ('Sensual' - a cabernet from Argentina) which was great and on the lower end of the price scale. The waitress was nice but not as over-the-top enthusiastic, knowledgable, and descriptive as I have experienced at similar restaurants. Overall, a very good meal. We would definitely return."}
{"text":"Went New Years Eve. Very nice place, cozy atmosphere. It was five of us and we all enjoyed the service a lot and the food was excellent. Can't go wrong!!!"}
{"text":"Birthday dinner last night. Server was John.  He is absolutely the best.  Ask for him if you go as he will make your dining experience perfect.  Flemings salad best in the city.  Petite filet tender & done to perfection.  Side dish of Flemings potatoes perfect with meal.  No dessert this trip but chocolate lava cake would be the choice.  From the moment you walk in until you leave your experience/interaction with all staff is first class.   JUST GO AND ASK FOR JOHN."}
{"text":"My friends and I had a wonderful experience. Our service was stellar!! Thomas Carter didn't disappoint.   We had service for 5 and we let the server guide us, after we all told him our preferences. For starters we tried the calamari and the Brie.  The calamari was top notch.  The filets were served in slices and so was the king crab.  The meat was perfectly served as was the King  crab  all were absolutely phenomenal.  So nice for everyone to be able to just plate and eat!!!  We ordered sautéed spinach prepared at request and done to perfection and Potatoes served mashed and su gratin were both amazing.  Migration Pinot noir 2014 as well as Paraduxx 2012 by duckhorn where excellent choices selected by our server. A meal to remember. Compared to many other competitors Flemings truly gave us an experience to remember."}
{"text":"I do love Flemings. Go there often. Our last visit was somewhat disappointing.  Ordered the short ribs, one of their small plates. I love short ribs.  These failed me. The meat was tough and very stringy.  the only thing that helped a little,, was the sauce.  the mac and cheese was very  good, as was the onion soup. The fish small plate that my friend ordered was ok.  Was extremely unhappy with the bread they served. Not fitting for a fine steak house."}
{"text":"I'm so overwhelmingly disappointed in our entire expierence here. Before I start, I'll note that we were here for restaurant week.   We got there a little early for our reservation and were sat pretty quick. It took about 15 minutes for our server to come over, but they were pretty busy. I ordered a drink, The Farmers Girl, and the husband got a tea. My drink, which was $14, wasn't very good and was very watered down for a drink of that price. His ice tea was some kind of fruit flavor, which they didn't tell him when we ordered.   I ordered the Modern Caesar Salad, Sliced Filet Mignon, sauteed mushrooms, and the carrot cake. He ordered the 14 oz Flank Steak (a $10 upcharge), with the Tenderloin Steak Soup, sauteed mushrooms, and the cheesecake.   Let's start with the starters. I really enjoyed my salad. Like, a lot. I didn't know I liked capers until this. The crisp prosciutto chips were probably the most disappointing thing on this dish, because honestly it tasted like microwaved pepperoni. His soup was not soup. No, really, it was chili. Why call it soup? It was funny chili, and pretty run of the mill at that.   Entree time. My actual filet was amazing. Credit where credit is due. It comes with a \"risotto\" and I asked for my side to be the sauteed mushrooms. You're probably wondering why I put risotto in quotes. Funny story, I offered my husband a bite, and he thought it was mashed potatoes. Wanna know what texture risotto isn't? They were a gummy flavorless mess of sadness. Originally, the dish was served with chili oil, which I asked to do without because I'm a spice weenie. Our server said that they too were heat sensitive and recommended that I go without it. I decided to focus on my side of mushrooms. Pro-tip, they're spicy. Not like \"oh dear lord why?!?\" spicy, but the more you eat, the more intense they get. I got through 5 before I had to call it quits. Husband's steak was perfectly cooked and the rub was really tasty. Really this review is 2 stars more for his food than mine. The mushrooms got a bit overwhelming for him too, but his tolerance is much much higher than mine.  He at least made it through his.   Dessert. I got the carrot cake, and it was good carrot cake. My judgement on this isn't going to be fair. Because of my nut allergy, I almost never get carrot cake. They don't add nuts here, so I went for it. It was good. He got the cheesecake. His quote on it \"Have you had cheesecake before? Then you've eaten this one.\" So you know, a solid meh.   The server, who again was super busy, passed by our table at least 8 times before checking up on us. I'd only eaten my filet and the rest of my plate was untouched. The manager was kind enough to knock some money off the bill which wasn't strictly necessary, so that was good of them. However, overall this meal was a disappointment wrapped in way too much money. Even after the discount, we paid $100 for 2 people, tip included.   We won't be coming back. Portion sizes are ridiculously small for what you end up paying. I honestly feel like it's one of the restaurants you go to when you **know** you've upset your partner. It's the \"I'm so sorry, I love you, here's overpriced food\" place to go in Madison. That's not high praise."}
{"text":"Initially we received terrible service from a lazy and rude server who even told us that they are not allowed to explain their menu any longer. After receiving the main dishes and salads not as ordered, we brought the poor service to the attention of the manager. She immediately corrected the matter and replaced the server with Justin, who was spectacular. I gave three stars because the service was only great after we notified the manger. The first server should not even be working at Flemings. Her skills were more appropriate at Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Fleming's is in my hood, but being a steakhouse type of place, it had not been a priority to visit. I don't eat a lot of steak, and generally, I prefer my meals a tad cheaper than steakhouse prices. However, Fleming's happy hour delivers fast food prices in a red wine atmosphere.  The atmosphere is notable. Tuesday night, and the place was bumping with what I can only assume to be Summerlin's finest. There were Porsches lined up in valet, and I almost fled the scene because I was scared there was an Eyes Wide Shut type of thing going on inside. Entering was like discovering a secret society, but I liked the feeling of being an outsider. Sometimes I have an overactive imagination.  We arrived at 6:50ish, just in time for the happy hour that ends at 7pm. We sidled up to the bar, scanned the menu, and went straight for the $6 prime burger and a $3 tall, cold Blue Moon. Already a solid 4-star experience based on value. Even sans happy hour, the prices seemed reasonable for a steakhouse.  The burger was a winner, but a little overcooked, so maybe order your burger a shade under your desired end temperature. I went for Medium Well and received a solid Well. Loved the big challah-esque bun! The sides were notable too. A couple of nicely, thick cut onion rings, and a mini-wedge. Granted the mini-wedge is more like a pile of garnishes for your burger, but we requested a side of blue cheese, received both the dressing and crumbles, and chopped that garnish up into a dreamy side salad. Ta-da! And then they all took off their masks... just kidding."}
{"text":"Oh and to think I used to like this place.  On our visit tonight we had the Sunday prime rib special. The prime rib was tasteless and the Mac and cheese was like soup. The bread was not as good as in the past and they changed the way they prepare the wedge salad and it wasn't for the better. Instead of blue cheese crumbles it was served with a blue cheese pat. Like a pat of butter. A 1 inch strip of bacon not crumbles. Fried onion strings that were soggy not crisp fresh onions. It was like you had to create your salad after it was served and chop everything up yourself. The guy in the booth behind us complained that the prime rib was tough and got a free dessert. Ours came with dessert which the portions were smaller than in the past but that's okay as we were already disenchanted with the whole meal. Although the cheesecake and turtle cake were good.  The restaurant was very, very loud. We had to keep repeating ourselves. While I'm on my rant, my husband and I went to their happy hour a week ago and had the $6.00 prime burger. I thought it was just okay. Husband did not like at all. Thank goodness only $6.00 and not the normal $14.00.   Maybe a bad night but too many other places in town to get a good steak."}
{"text":"Had dinner at the bar area. The food was delicious and the creme brulee was amazing! The service was top notch! Plan on coming back for happy hour sometime!"}
{"text":"Went there yesterday for my birthday and I have to say I agree with the other post about the Quality of food it is just not worth it. However I disagree with the staff comments.  We had excellent service from a very attentive staff.  Water glasses always full, table always clean.  I would love to see this once premium brand of restaurant get back on track.  The steaks were just a steak not great at all.  The seabass, and asparagus had too much heat(spices). Making it hard to eat if you don't like that spice .  The cheesecake was amazing.  Maybe just go for drinks and deserts.."}
{"text":"Great food, however the noise is just to much to enjoy the meal."}
{"text":"I cannot fault anything at this restaurant. The place was ambient, comfortable, service was efficient, wait staff friendly and knowledgeable, food was perfect. We celebrated our wedding anniversary here last night. We were congratulated and given a card and boxed truffles. Staff checked in on us all through the evening. We had a great time and loved everything about this place. Cannot recommend highly enough! We will certainly eat here again in the near future."}
{"text":"I went here for an interview dinner and was pleasantly surprised; not a chain guy or a steakhouse guy this is where the team wanted to have dinner and as such I obliged to the order of twin lobster tails with drawn better, cream corn soufflé, and fresh summer berries with whipped cream - a $78 order I'd have much preferred to spend at Parma, Fat Choy, Honey Salt, or many other local chef driven restaurants, yet Fleming's nailed them all.  I'd not return on my dollar, but if you want to take a terribly unadventurous eater out for a 'safe' steak dinner you could do a whole lot worse."}
{"text":"The only thing I do not like is its just to dark no windows, kind of confining but that is just my taste. The happy hour is what I am reviewing and that gets a 5 for the food and drinks, they have a 7 dollar burger (comes with fries) that is one of best I have ever had definitely in my top 5 in history, the carpaccio is very good also.Service is top notch as well as the drinks (especially the Martinis) I go in because I have become addicted to the burger it is one of the few places that will cook it the way you want it you can actually have a rare burger there or rare plus the way I get it (between rare and medium rare)"}
{"text":"Our food server Paul was excellent, our fillets were so tasty, the wine Devine. Great experience highly recommend."}
{"text":"I have spent two birthdays at Flemmings. . . and visited on other occasions.  I want to love it, but I just don't. . . I only like it.  I've never been disappointed with the service or the decor.  They are both to die for and if I was only reviewing the service I would gladly provide a five star rating.  The team at Flemmings is on their \"A-Game\".  Flemmings happy hour is the BOMB Diggity.  The appetizers and cocktails can't be beat, bring back the seared ahi please.   The decor is warm and rich and the smells mingling from the kitchen are intoxicating.    All of the being said. . . on both occasions I wanted an out-of-this world steak and I got an alright steak.  The cuts were ok, and they weren't cooked perfectly on either occasion.  There was no wow factor.  I can cook a better filet or rib eye at home.  I am an Iowa farmer's daughter and I know my beef.  Maybe I am spoiled and have high expectations, but with the price tag at Flemmings the steaks should match the excellent service.  The sides we ordered were also just ok.  The use of cream and butter drown out the mac and cheese and mashed potatoes.  I will go back to Flemmings again at some point and I will stick with the appetizers for now."}
{"text":"I was invited here for my birthday dinner and it's definitely a moment I won't forget. The service was impeccable from beginning to end. All the staff, including our server, were on top of their customer service throughout.  For drinks, I ordered Blood Orange Sangria, which included; Skyy infusions blood orange vodka, orange peel, and pomegranate. Probably the strongest and best sangria I've had in a while. My friend ordered the Farmers Daughter, which included  fresh strawberries and citrus with hints of basil. The drink itself tasted very refreshing and not too fruity, with a tad taste of the vodka at the end.  For appetizers, we ordered the Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes with roasted red pepper and lime butter sauce. These were by far were the best crab cakes I've ever had and they literally melt in your mouth. The lime butter sauce was the kicker at the end of each bite.  For the main course I ordered the Gulf Shrimp and Sea Scallops which were scampi style with squash vermicelli. The taste was okay and I later regretted not ordering steak, since it is a steak restaurant. He ordered the 16oz Dry Aged Prime Rib, medium rare. It was very delicious and surprising not dry like I expected. His side was the chipotle cheddar mac & cheese. That was probably my favorite part and it went great with the steak.  To finish dinner they presented me with a birthday card, box of tasty chocolates, and a $25 gift certificate. I thought that was a sweet touch and I'll definitely be going back to use that soon!"}
{"text":"Flemings's here in Summerlin is a good spot to relax and enjoy a nice quiet dinner if you are looking for a decent steak and don't feel like driving down to the strip. They are going on 15 years and recently remodeled the dining room & bar. They focused mainly on the bar area, which they expanded due to their growing happy hour crowd and slightly changed the dining room. It looks great and seems to flow a lot better than before.  As far as the food goes what can I say except it's a chain. Is it good? Yes it's good. Are they using drug-free, grass-fed cattle, without hormones and antibiotics, or free range poultry that is also hormone and antibiotic free, NO. Is it organic farm to table ingredients or wild caught fish, NO. The fact that chains like to throw around fancy terms like Aged USDA Prime, Choice, Select, meats doesn't change the fact that it's Factory-Farmed, Grain Fed Beef. For the record this isn't a Fleming's bash session it's more of a chain steakhouse rant that should be addressed and includes their competitors Morton's, Ruth's Chris, or even worse, places like Long Horn, or Lone Star. It's worth noting that I do frequent Fleming's. I just want to be clear when I say it's good, because it is good. It's just not great or as healthy as it could be for the prices they charge. To be fair the job of any restaurant CEO and his/her board is to fight for consistency and their bottom line that's it, not the health of their customer. The health of the customer is the responsibility of the customer not the restaurants."}
{"text":"Always a good time when we come here.  Staff are always on top of their game and very pleasant.  On terms of being a steak house Flemings is more like a 4 star restaurant, but due to the ambience and good service this location deserves 5 stars!"}
{"text":"This is one of my absolute favorite dining (& happy hour) spots in all of Vegas!  I've probably been here no less than 10 times.  Every time the service is consistently flawless - fast, friendly & accurate.  The food is cooked perfectly to order.  It was at this very place last year on Friday, October 29th that I experienced food and wine pairing magic.  We had brought in our own wine that I received as a birthday gift, a 1979 Joseph Phelps Insignia that we paired with our first course of beef carpaccio.  I was in such bliss I nearly slid right out of my seat onto the floor.    For happy hour you can't go wrong with any of the food offered: Ahi Tuna with mustard wasabi sauce, Sweet Chili Calamari, Mushroom Ravioli, Cajun bbq shrimp, and the Tenderloin Carpaccio.  They call it the 5 for $6 until 7.  They offer 5 wines, 5 cocktails, & 5 apps from 5-7 daily.    The management team deserves recognition for consistently maintaining very high quality standards that you can count on and look forward to."}
{"text":"As a regular we were very surprised tonight when we asked for some chips while at the Bar. They came out stale. We mentioned this to the Bartender who appologized and took the bowl of chips back to the kitchen.  Our purpose for telling her they were stale was to make sure no one else got a bowl of stale chips. Later she returned with a bowl of Hot, sort of burnt chips which appeared to be old chips just thrown in the deep fryer. They tasted burnt and old. Not happy.  The rest of our dining experience was good."}
{"text":"With $50 in comps from a fun Yelp event last year promoting happy hour in the bar and an opening for a late reservation time on a Friday night, we made the journey across town to Fleming's. Dinner was good overall with the consistency you'd expect from this chain with the food and prices.  Parking is a bear here during peak times as the lot is shared with another restaurant and a strip mall. I didn't mind the 10 minute walk to the restaurant, but if you do, don't be afraid to utilize the valet. We were greeted and seated immediately in the loud, busy restaurant in a large booth. Quarters are pretty tight with us having to side step between tables to get to our booth.  Wine lovers won't be disappointed in the selection and it will be easy to find your favorite as the list is organized neatly in the iPad provided. My wife went with her usual Moscato and I started with a whiskey peach martini and finished with a big pour of a Round Pond Kith & Kin Cab. The tenderloin carpaccio and shrimp cocktail were good starters but even though the shrimp were large, we probably could have spent the $21 on something different. Only the bone was left when finished with my bone in ribeye and my wife had room for only about half of her double chicken breast. I wasn't a fan of the Fleming's potatoes, as they were too heavy on the cheese and I was looking for starch as a side for my steak and not dairy. Make sure you give the kitchen at least 20 minutes if you want to order the chocolate lava cake.  Service was just OK for the price point. Our server wasn't that engaging or helpful, and was absent for about ten minutes after we finished dessert. I wasn't impressed at all with the food runner carrying four to five entrees on one arm with the bottom of some entrees touching the top of the food of other entrees. Is using a tray not flashy enough?  Before comps, the total was $230. We have our go to steakhouse in Summerlin which I believe has a superior steak, service, and a price point of $40 less per person. Fleming's is good but would be a second or third option for us. Happy hour is probably the way to go here or coming in for some of their special dinners that they advertise such as the 3-course filet and lobster for $49.95 might bring you the best value."}
{"text":"Nice romantic place waiter was rud and it looked like you better look like you have money or ales they will give you the look  one of those type of places, not to satisfy."}
{"text":"My sister was in town for a visit, so I decided to splurge and treat us to dinner at Fleming's. I had been here before for wine and a burger at happy hour, and had just received a $50 off $100+ coupon, so we decided to get a table and indulge in a steak. Our server, Jennifer, was excellent, as were the food runners. I ordered a big pour 14 Hands Cab ($14.25) and my sister ordered a big pour Mionetto ($17.25). It always gives me pause when I get a GLASS of wine and am charged 1.5 times the retail cost of the ENTIRE bottle, but it is what it is; the wine was good and the big pour was enough to last through the meal. We shared the Main Filet Mignon (12 oz), medium rare $49.95. The steak was cooked perfectly, and was quite tender, BUT we both thought it was quite bland/tasteless. Don't get me wrong. I know filets have a lighter flavor, but this one? Nothing. Nada. I never add salt to cooked food, but I had to salt my steak as I sliced it to bring it out of total oblivion. Sad for a $50 steak!  We ordered two of the shareable sides: shoestring fries and creamed spinach. The creamed spinach was ok, but rather soupy - more like a dip than a side and heavy on the garlic(?). The fries were a bust:  oily and limp. At the end of the meal I told Jennifer this, and that they needed to change the vendor, the temperature of the oil, or both. She said the fries were cut in house. Whoops - it's the kitchen. She graciously comp'ed the fries.  All in all, I would come back for the service, but not for the steak or the sides we chose."}
{"text":"I ate here about two weeks ago and I have to say I was very unimpressed. I came here because about 5 years ago I had the best filet ever. Their steak has gone down hill. My rating is based solely on the food and not the service. If I was doing the review based on service, it would have been a 5 star.   I got the larger filet and ordered it med. well. When it first came out, it was so burned that it was like eating beef jerky. Normally I don't send food back, because you never know what could happen, but when paying 45 for just the steak... I thought hell no. So ok fine, no biggie. I send it back, and it comes back in less then 20 min. I start cutting into the steak and could tell right away something wasn't right... Oh that's because it came back raw. Third time finally got it right but the quality of steak is certainly not worth the price.... The meat was so very tough. Hard to justify paying 45 for it. Very sad, as I will not waste my money there again, until I'm over my anger with the cook. The sides came out luke warm, which wasn't impressive at all but we said nothing considering the whole steak fiasco. With two of us, both having a salad a steak and one side, an iced tea and glass of wine then a shared desert was 160 (which was after they comped the steak). By far a disappointment.   On the flip side, our server was amazing. I mean we never had a dirty plate or empty glass the entire time we were there. So if you are looking for the highest quality of service, this is the place to go. If their food matched the prices then we wouldn't let the bad steak ruin us. Maybe after my distaste wears off, I'll try them out again."}
{"text":"I love Flemings, it's dressy and the ambience is just right. I think their steaks are consistent as any one of their competitors and living in the Las Vegas area, there are many. We decided to sneak in and take advantage of their happy hour. What a great decision! We had the prime burger and the carpaccio, both soooo good with two glasses of Cabernet. I can't tell you what a great perfect a time it was. Megan was our server was very attentive."}
{"text":"The food here is INCREDIBLY good!  I have yet to delve into the main dinner menu because I'm usually here for what is a very affordable happy hour. I have not had anything that isn't amazing. The crab cakes are generous and delicious, the burger is awesome, the brie cheese puff pastry is rich and oh so good (very shareable portion). The mushroom ravioli is some of the best pasta i have had...the mushroom sauce on the plate never goes to waste because if i don't manage to eat it all, they have a basket of bread nearby for u to make sure u enjoy every bit.....and my absolute favorite dish is the tuna steak   Holy holes in a boat, batman. This tuna is incredibly fresh, flavorful, and the spicy mustard sauce (spicy mustard and wasabi) is so good a drizzle wont do. You might as well order the sauce in a lil bowl on the side.   I stumbled upon a great wine as well playing spin the bottle on the ipad menus at the bar as well. Chateau parenchere....that is also something i have not been able to deviate from because it is THAT good!  And at $10 a glass, its reasonable as well.   I have been beyond satisfied with the service here, and everybody on the wait staff has been professional, engaging, and really nice to me (even coming here in shorts and a t shirt my very first visit), I appreciate that non snobby treatment.   Do yourself a favor and try this place at least once......but be warned, it is habit forming"}
{"text":"It's your wedding annivsary, you forget to make a reservation for dinner, luckily our Golden Knights are in the Stanley Cup finals having a great first season, so we were able to get a reservation at Flemings. My wife have been here on and off since 2008 and honestly, we stop coming due to lack of service, food quality and ambience or the lack of  Food - We have come 4 times this year and I will say my wife and I have yet to be disappointed this year. I usually do seafood and my wife does filet mignon and the meal's have always been cooked to order.  Service - Always on point, I yet to have to ask for things like drink refills or if I ask for something additional after ordering, its not forgotten. The wait staff is very friendly while being efficient. I like the fact the wait staff gives you a business card at the end of the meal and encourages you to engage the mgmt team.  Management - This year, the management team always checks on you to ensure your happy  Restaurant itself - Recently, this property went thru a decent facelift getting rid of all the large wine and liquor bottles they had sitting on shelves and refreshed the restaurant to look like a steak house.   This restaurant has made, in my opinion a turn around for the better and I am happy to have another quality restaurant on the west side of town to dine at."}
{"text":"Surprisingly delicious! I guess I'm not a fan of chain restaurants, but I had unused gift cards and a craving for steak.  The rib eye was cooked to perfection and had a nice sear/crust on the outside.  Sauces are available for pairing with the steaks..they actually brought a sample of all the sauces to our table...and by far the madeira was the most flavorful and paired very well with our steaks.  The sides (garlic mashed potatoes and creamed spinach) honestly were nothing to write home about, but were good but slightly forgettable.  Honestly, the mushroom ravioli appetizer was the most memorable for me, the pasta wrapping was very delicate and the ravioli literally felt like it melted in my mouth...I was tempted to just eat multiple orders of the ravioli as my main entree....it was that good =)  Definitely recommend this place if you want to avoid strip madness and still get a quality steak."}
{"text":"We celebrated our anniversary here. Servers are top notch and makes you feel like you are the only one there.  You are pampered during your attendance.  We started out with the New Wedge Lettuce which had grape tomatoes, crispy onions, caramelized bacon and blue cheese.  The prime rib was absolutely fabulous as were the asparagus.  It is a little on the expensive side, but you get what you pay for...food, drink and service that is unmatched.  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"If you don't love meat, don't eat here.  Flemings is one of my all time favorite restaurants, this however was my first time to this location and it didn't disappoint.  We went to Flemings to celebrate a big step forward in the growth of my boyfriend's business. We made reservations online for their Filet and Lobster special $39.95 a person. We arrived and only had a brief wait before being seated. We were handed our menus and an iPad which had an interactive app for their wine list.  Our waiter was attentive and patient. It took me forever to decide on a bottle of wine - Caymus Conundrum. When I placed the order he said, \"the Red right?\" I was so thankful he said that, because I wasn't even aware that conundrum came in a red version, and no I didn't want that. Whew, that was close. They didn't have the white version we were hoping for, they do have it in Salt Lake, but the wines vary by location (they are hand chosen by the sommelier). We decided against a bottle after all, I ordered a glass of wine and my boyfriend ordered a beer.   Note: Each location has an extensive wine list 250 or so wines and many are available by the glass. If you purchase a whole bottle, they will typically save the label for you and put it on a nice card you can save as a memento, perfect for special occasions! If you order a bottle of red wine, they'll bring a decanter to your table - this is they way all restaurants need to do it!  We placed our dinner order and enjoyed their fresh baked bread while we waited. If you haven't been here you'll LOVE their specialty butter - it's to die for! One is sun dried tomato, the other is champagne infused. You'll certainly want more than they bring you of each, and in the past I've not been too proud to ask for some to take home with my left overs - yes it's THAT good!  Our meals came with wedge salads - my favorite! The bacon was sweet (maple), and the blue cheese was generous. Our steaks were cooked to perfection! His was Medium rare, mine medium. The lobster was the best I've had in years! Not fishy at all, not rubbery, simply amazing! It also came with a side of spaghetti squash that was tasty too.  We ended our meal with their Chocolate Lava Cake - $11.95. It takes 20 minutes to make so you have to order it part way into your meal. But it is heaven on a plate! Worth every penny and definitely something to share.  I can't wait for our next excuse to celebrate, because I'm already dying to go back!  Tip: In Nevada, if you order a bottle of wine and can't finish it, they are allowed to re-cork it and send it home with you. Good to know.  Tip: They often have great pre-fix menus (check their website), but typically you'll have to make reservations online to get the offering. Also, for most holidays like Mother's Day, Father's Day, etc. They typically will offer a $25 gift card for your visit, good on a future visit."}
{"text":"Exchanged some of my Amex points for a $100 gift card here.  What a great dinner it was.  As a whole meal from beginning to end...it certainly is better than either Morton's or Ruth's Chris.  I like aspects of both those restaurants but certain things still lack for a complete meal.    For ex...we only order steak at Ruth's Chris.  No sides, apps or desserts...cuz they all suck.  But not this place. Fleming's was surprisingly awesome.  The place was also super packed for a random Tuesday night.    The bread for example doesn't come with just butter.  You get a feta cheese butter and a sun dried tomato butter.  I got the ribeye and the wife got the usual rare filet which were both fantastic.  Tons of sides to choose from and went with creamed spinach and mac and cheese. Had some special dessert not on the menu which was basically a super version of a Mcdonald's apple pie w/ cranberries and vanilla ice cream.  Fn great.    They also have a killer happy hour from 5-7."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a very early reservation (5:30 p.m.) on a Saturday night. We arrived early at approximately 5 and sat at the bar. The bar atmosphere was fine but not outstanding, the bartenders were very pleasant and my sangria was good (not great but good). I was surprised to see so many people in the bar area so early but one look at their happy hour menu told me why! I plan on coming back for happy hour sometime in the not to distant future. We were seated for dinner at our leisure. Our waitress Heather was friendly, knowledgeable and funny. The bread and flavored butters that we started with were delicious. We ordered the Prince Edward island mussels and sausage appetizer...it was only ok. The quality was good but the flavor was rather bland. I would not order them again. On to the steaks! My husband ordered the 8-oz petite fillet with the bbq shrimp companion. He loved it, I liked it too! I ordered the petite fillet with truffle poached lobster, it was also excellent. The quality of the meat was great and they were cooked/seasoned to perfection. The sauces that accompanied the \"companions\" were very good and well-balanced too. My only complaint was that there was very little hint of truffle to the truffle poached lobster. I love, love, love truffle and wish there would have been more truffle flavor present. We split a side of sauteed mushrooms and they were lack luster; another item I would not order again. In hind sight we should have ordered to chipotle mac and cheese. That sounds sinfully delicious. I also thought it was slightly overpriced for the area but not so much that I suffered sticker shock. All in all, yes I'd go back for the steaks but I would order a different appetizer and/or side. The staff was great and the happy hour menu looks divine."}
{"text":"Outstanding & delicious food and excellent service.  10/10 will be back!  Server was introduced as Aaron (although the bill said he was Ryan?) and he did such a good job of taking care of my wife & I.   I was mildly concerned when we sat down - the tableware included a very heavy duty knife. The kind of knife I might be happy to have with me in an impromptu fight. That made me wonder just how chewy the steaks were going to be. (Face it, the person who ordered the tableware could be the person who orders the beef, right?)  Well worry not, tasty steak fans: after starting out with the knife and fork I put away the knife. My steak was easily tender enough for just a fork!  Whoa!     So I wholeheartedly recommend Flemings in Madison and especially their signature steaks.  Tender & very tasty.  We WILL be back often."}
{"text":"My mom and I had Christmas Eve dinner here.  We had a 645pm reservation but did not get a seat until about 720pm.  Supposedly people were taking longer than normal to finish up.  I guess it was Christmas Eve after all but the restaurant should have planned reservations better.   Once we finally sat down, our service was very good.  The waitress and her assistants came by often to check on us and refill our water glasses.   We started with appetizers.  My mom had the onion soup and I had the wedge salad.  My mom enjoyed her soup - good flavor and cheese.  My wedge salad was delicious - nice big chunk of blue cheese, crispy onions, tomatoes, blue cheese dressing.  All yummy.    For our meals, my mom had the lobster tails with drawn butter.  They took the tails out of the shells at the table.  Nice touch.  I had the petite filet mingion with béarnaise sauce.  The steak was a little tough but it was very tasty and cooked correctly.    We did not have room for dessert but they looked good.  The hostess did tell us we would get a free appetizer due to the long wait for a table but our waitress did not seem to know that so there was no free appetizer on the menu and she did not ask.  The table next to us got a free dessert since they waited too.  If they are going to offer free stuff, make sure the staff knows.    We did have coffee and tea.  My mom did not like the coffee - too bitter and strong.  My tea was good - got to pick my flavor which is always a nice touch.  Also, it was extremely noisy in the restaurant.  Not sure if people were just louder due to Christmas Eve or if its normally that loud.  It was hard to talk across the table.  They did have a nice quartet singing Christmas carols.    We will probably come back to Flemings on a slower night as the food and service was outstanding but won't book on a holiday again."}
{"text":"So...the evening started out not so good. We had reservations at 7:15 for a booth and were not seated until 7:45. Granted, the place was PACKED and it was a Saturday evening...and the hosts did apologize like a gazilian times and there were a lot of other people waiting as well...you got the picture. We finally got seated and the manager Jackie immediately came over and apologized again and said due to the inconvenience the appetizer was on her and again apologized and we explained that we have homes in Pasadena, Los Altos Hills and Summerlin so we go to the Flemings in Pasadena, LA Live and Palo Alto as well and never have to wait this long to be seated so we were mad but now feel bad because everyone is being too nice and apologizing too much! Anyhow, the food was AMAZING, our server Logan was AMAZING, all his helpers were AMAZING, and what started off as a not so good evening ended up to be the best dinner we've had here in Vegas so far!!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time dining at Fleming's & it will likely be my last.   My gf ordered the special that night, filet mignon and spicy shrimp. I ordered the bone-in ribeye, mid-rare. We ordered many side dishes (grilled asparagus, sauteed mushrooms, chipotle mac & cheese) as well -- since it was our first visit we wanted to sample several items.  Her filet was cooked as asked, mid-rare, and the shrimp were nicely prepared. My steak, however, was another story. Admittedly, it was a fantastic cut of beef, but it was completely annihilated in the broiler. It was just a hair shy of well-done. I sent it back and our server (who was spectacular, by the way) promptly returned it to the kitchen. Within seconds, the Manager came over to apologize and admitted they had \"missed it by a longshot\" and immediately comped the steak & offered to re-fire all of our sides and bring them out with my new steak. I did not take him up on that as I didn't feel it was necessary. I continued to munch on the sides while waiting for my steak. When it arrived, it was noticeably different in appearance. It was much larger in diameter and much, much thinner. In fact, the rib bone had been cut in half lengthwise. By this time I was so full from eating the sides that I simply cut into the steak to check for temperature (more rare than medium-rare, but I was happier with that) and asked them to just box it up to take home. I wish I would have continued eating it. When I ate it the following day, it was one of the worst cuts of beef I have ever seen. Anywhere. Shameful for a \"prime\" steakhouse to serve something like that. There was so much connective tissue in this steak that it rendered it essentially inedible. The fat on it wasn't the delicious, marbled type in high quality ribeyes. It was the chewy, gristly kind on CHEAP cuts of meat. I can only assume that they have separate steaks for comped meals, which is ridiculous. I hope I'm wrong about that. I've had better at Texas Roadhouse. The sides were very good, but not enough to salvage the meal. You don't pay Prime Steakhouse prices just to get some decent asparagus. Meal AFTER the comped steak was still $100 and not worth even half that. Our server, Laura, was the only redeeming factor of the entire meal."}
{"text":"This review is for the SONOMA SUNDAY BRUNCH at the Fleming's in Summerlin (not all locations have the Sunday brunch).  Most people don't think of this steakhouse for brunch, but we've been to the Summerlin location twice now for that very thing and had great experiences both times.  There are currently two prix fixe lunches to choose from, one with the main course of blue crab omelet and the other with buttermilk fried chicken.  Both of these prix fixe menus come with a starter and a dessert.  If you don't want either of these, there are several other things on the a la carte menu to choose from including a Filet Mignon Benedict, Crispy Chicken and Waffles, and Prime Rib Hash.  For side dishes, we've enjoyed the cheese grits as well as the rosemary-brown sugar bacon.  And, Sunday brunch isn't Sunday brunch without a mimosa; Fleming's serves up bottomless Sonoma Sparklers, their signature mimosa made with passion fruit. Service has been excellent with the manager on duty coming by and checking on us during our meals.  If you want to try a new spot for your Sunday brunch meal, give Fleming's a go."}
{"text":"We are longtime Flemings customers (say 10+ years). Went there last night to celebrate my husband's birthday (4 days early but Sunday is the only day on which they serve prime rib). Discovered that their entire menu had changed last Tuesday. \"Small Plates\" have been entirely removed (I don't have a big appetite and always ordered from that section. It was just the right size). The wine that we had the last time we were there has been removed. Of course, the prices have gone up. Very disappointing, to say the least, to pay those kind of high prices and be dissatisfied. Might need to try someplace else for future celebrations. Too bad. :-("}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill. Frequent this chain a lot but this location has its issues. Staff is not attentive, the manager is an idiot, and no one seems to care.  Went for their Easter brunch and over paid for lame service. The windows were open and the reflection off of cars were shining in to our eyes and a few other tables. We asked if they could lower the shade. They did. Then idiot manager comes and opens it. She refused to keep it closed. She ended up redirecting the light to 3 other tables so they had the pleasure of the sun.   I brought my whole family. My kids ate sausage and then I found out their sausage was raw! I showed the idiot manager who again didn't seem to understand that I would be the one dealing with this situation later--not empathetic and not a very bright person at all. She gave me a coupon for a discount on another brunch in the future, wtf? Stupid. I should have brought the kids back to throw up in the restaurant so they could deal with it.   Don't support this location!"}
{"text":"Tip: Go to costco and get the gift cards.  They were offering a christmas special, $100 giftcard for $71, so I got $200 worth and took my Stephen for a steak dinner.  We ordered the Flemings salad, which was refreshing, and a perfect starter.  Then we each ordered the dry aged rib eye, and split the creamed corn and flemings potatoes.  Originally I wanted a NY Strip, but my waiter suggested the rib eye, so I agreed. I usually skip the rib eye because I tend to find it too fatty, although it is flavorful.  Stephen lucked out and got a rib eye that was perfectly marbled... Very little excessive exterior fat.  My piece was 1/4 fat, so on my plate was a blob of fat.  My waiter weakly apologized and pretty much said that's the chance of getting a rib eye.  For $52 I wasn't expecting that much fat!  For dinner we opted for coffee, no dessert.  Most places will comp coffee, especially after an incident as to how much fat I got versus meat for dinner.  Comped coffee is a nice gesture, and usually means more gratuity toward the bill. Nope, no such luck.  With tax and tip, our dinner for 2 came to $200. Lucky I got the gift card from Costco, and paid  $58 less... but still not a cheap dinner.  I think next time I'll stick to the NY Strip, and still stick to Costco to save me 20%!  3 stars because my fat filled plate was never dealt with."}
{"text":"Consistently good chops and steaks.  Nothing negative to say here.  They should change up the menu from time to time though."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times with gift cards so price wise we havent been hit hard in here. So this review is strictly food & service based. The filet & chicken dishes are tough to beat. Always cooked perfectly. So good make you wanna smack yo momma! The mash potato sides are really good to. Had a spicy shrimp appetizer dish last time i was there and it blew me away. But the best part....are the mints at the front desk. Do yourself a favor and fill your pockets. They are breathtaking!"}
{"text":"I don't eat at many chain restaurants on purpose but I was told about the burger and that it was $6 at happy hour and figured that I'd give it a try.   The burger is a legit steakhouse burger. The burger tasted fresh and was prepared perfectly. The burger is worth the full price ($12) and well worth the happy hour price?   The fries were a little overcooked but that's fine.   They have beer and wine specials too both of which compliment the burger nicely.   I have no desire to eat a steak here but will return for happy hour."}
{"text":"From the time you walk in till the time you leave the greeters to the waiters are awesome. The food does take a while but they bring bread and butter and another spread that is very good to eat. It would be better if the bread was already sliced to offset others in your table grabbing the bread. The crab cakes are absolutely delicious. 2 is just not enough on the crab cake order. And the filet that I ordered was so mouth watering. My boyfriend had the Flemings potato--- that was great also. For dessert we would have ordered the lava cake but we were so full. Lastly, the ambience is so romantic.  The meal does take several hours to complete so don't be in a hurry."}
{"text":"8/10 on the filet.  Asparagus was good bit a little burnt and hard ends.  Creme brule was good.  Service was good for being so busy.  Took forever to get the entree but needed to kill time for a movie so I'm not complaining. . 7.5/10 overall . $$$$"}
{"text":"Fleming's provides outstanding service for every dining experience. We have frequented Happy Hour, wine tastings, Sunday dinners and reserved the banquet room for a baptismal celebration.   I am always in search of positive dining out with young children.  For Sunday supper, we were able to check in at 4:30 pm. We sat in a spacious corner booth with a large, round table. Like all of our visits, we were treated with kindness and immediacy. We felt like a priority.  The children received apple slices with a warm caramel sauce. My son had chicken tenders with shoestring fries. My daughter had steak and shoestring fries, let me rephrase this, filet mignon prepared rare+. The proportions were generous. The quality was sumptuous. I regret I didn't capture platings with photographs, I was too engaged in our mealtime.  I particularly liked the Caesar Salad. The crispy, parmesan crisp and saltiness of the capers added uniqueness and a zesty flavor. Watch out for the prosciutto chip as an accoutrement if you are avoiding meat and pork.   Jessica cared for each step of service. The entire staff was readily available and ensured we were comfortable and satisfied. I look forward to future outings at Fleming's and perhaps they will add organic sources of food and highlight vegan and gluten-free options on the menu."}
{"text":"What a great way to welcome in the New Year.  I have limited fine dining experience in Las Vegas but this was highly recommended and the chosen venue for a New Year's Eve meal.  Fleming's hails from Newport Beach and I am surprised that in the 1990's when I lived in Newport I never dined at the original location.  The exterior facade is a welcome sight to the faux glitter of the casino strip.  Upon entering the two sets of doors, the layout was a perfect square with the bar to the left and the main dining area was dead center, somewhat sunken.  It gave you a good overview visual.  We were fortunate to have been seated in a somewhat smaller adjacent private dining room that had about 8 tables.  I like fine beef but rarely (sort of a pun) eat it but obviously this was going to be the mission statement here.  I ordered the Puccini Filet Mignon and ordered it medium rare.  An absolutely perfect slice of beef and cooked to perfection.  It melted in my mouth.  I also started with the house salad that was pleasant but not noteworthy.  The waiting staff was VERY well trained and when it was appropriate we were solicited for the top-drawer dessert that would require 20 minutes of preparation.  All in all, it really was a perfect dining experience.  My 4-star rating is based on that our actual waitress greeted us, took our order and finally served up the check.  There was subordinate staff that really took care of us throughout the meal.  It sounds silly, but in fine dining I prefer to establish a quick and friendly rapport with the person I am actually paying and tipping.    Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"My entire family was dazzled by the service and quality of the food. It was an overall spectacular event even though we had a little under an hour to eat and run to catch a show. Our server, I believe his name was Billy, went the extra mile to ensure we enjoyed ourselves even though we made it a point that we needed to \"stuff ourselves and dash\".   3 of us had prime rib and it was probably the best beef we have ever had. The previous night we have filet Mignon, but it didn't compare to the prime rib we had at Flemings. The salad and side dishes of creamed spinach & mashed potatoes were ridiculously good! The prime rib came with 3 different sauces too. My kid ordered onion rings for his side and the four of us enjoyed them together.  What more can I say? We didn't experience anything bad about this place. Our waiter approached our table with a trainee but made it a point to let us know so we wouldn't question why there was a guy following him around. The entire staff - servers, manager, hostess, etc. - were very polite and professional. This place runs like a well-oiled machine.   When I was rushing through the front door, I heard a voice behind me say \"Thank you Mr. {my name}\" with a smile from the hostess ... that was like the cherry on top of a great evening at Flemings.  I wish all my dining experiences were like what I experienced at Flemings. When we visit Vegas again, we will definitely return for a much slower paced dinner at Flemings."}
{"text":"Walk-In party of 6 on a Friday night, got us in with 10 minutes!!   Service: The staff is very friendly and consistent, always reading my orders back to assure its accurate.  Food: It is always fresh, hot and made to order. In comparison to a location I have gone to many times, it is very consistent to the brand. Plating and presentation were a little off, however the flavors were great.  Cleanliness: The restaurant from the main lobby to the kitchen is well kept. Floors, walls, and decor were all free from debris and dust.    Overall, I would recommend this location."}
{"text":"For paying $200 for 2 of us to eat I guess I had too high expectations. The potato was hard as a rock . There was a hair in my water glass (which I did not complain about ) and the desert cookie with ice cream was so hard we had to jam our fork into it to break off a piece to eat . We went to Flemings expecting a nice dinner out for our wedding anniversary and did not get that for sure! Our server was however amazing and the 25$ gift card with cordials was nice but I will not be going back. Don't even know if I will put someone else in this position by giving the gift card away."}
{"text":"Amazing service Kim!! Our first time here for an anniversary dinner and had a great experience. Will come again just for her."}
{"text":"We came here for my husbands 35th birthday dinner and had an exceptional experience.   We made reservations, and they sat us ON time, so we're off to a good start! Monica was our server and was extremely knowledgable and answered every question we had, helping us make great choices.   The Bloomsdale salad was probably the best salad I've ever had, anywhere! I highly recommend ordering it! The filet was cooked to perfection. Their signature potatoes and Thai green beans were both on the spicy side, which my husband loves, so that was good. They have 100 bottles of wine you can order by-the-glass. We got a bottle of Educated Guess, and it was magnificent. Because it was his birthday they gave him a free box of white chocolate truffles and a little gift card to come back again.   I love all the attention to detail at nice restaurants like this one. They definitely train every employee how to do their job extremely well. You definitely get the feel that people want to be working here and dining here. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Went here for Mother's Day brunch was seated right away in desired booth, had the 3 course brunch appetizer I choose lobster bisque which was amazing, for main course had the salmon Benedict which was ok was expecting more flavor. Then dessert had the cheesecake overall nice atmosphere nice service. Also a bonus the room manager greeted us and gave us a 25 $ gift card to come back for a future visit. And they could do without the valet in front that was a little ridiculous."}
{"text":"Had the Filet, King Crab legs, Fleming's Potatoes, and the Lava Cake. All of it was amazing!! The potatoes and the crab were the best I've ever had. The service was exceptional. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Rib eye steak and beef carpaccio are excellent choices(5/5)! Great dinner spot for any occasion."}
{"text":"You know when you are eating something so delicious, that as you start to come to the end of finishing the dish you get sad?  That is how I felt about every dish I had at this restaurant.  The service was great and location convenient, even for me who lives outside of Madison.  Very expensive though, so be prepared to shell out some money, but well worth it for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Popsicle martinis are the best will not regret it.  Jackie manager is fantastic always goes beyond to make sure everything is great.  Of course Ray our regular server knows exactly how we like our steaks."}
{"text":"I am a regular fan of Fleming's, but had never before tried its Las Vegas location.  A Filet & Lobster Special for $34.95 drew Diane and me in with another couple.  After our meal was completed, we were quite glad that we had come.  To begin at the beginning, we were presented with excellent chewy Rosemary Sourdough Bread with Chardonnay & Feta Cheese Butter.  Mmmmm!  Delicious!  Sun-Dried Tomato Butter was also offered, but I was not as fond of it.  French Onion Soup that came next was good but small, and the cheesy top was not fully capped.  A small Wedge Salad with vibrant Cherry Tomato halves, Blue Cheese Crumbles, and a Blue Cheese Dressing was excellent.  After 2 quickly downed glasses of Iced Tea, my small glass was smartly exchanged by our server for a large globe.  But later, just as she was pouring me a refill from a pitcher, the very attentive waitress was suddenly bumped from behind by a plate deliverer, and I was doused with Iced Tea.  It was no big deal, and not our server's fault.  But the manager came over, gave me her card, and said that the restaurant would pay for any needed drycleaning of my shirt and pants.  I appreciated the gesture, but regular washing by Diane took care of the problem, with no lingering stains.  And, except for the splash, service was otherwise exemplary.  My medium-rare Filet was excellent although peppery, and the meaty Lobster Tail was large and sweet, as I had hoped it would be.  Requested Bearnaise Sauce for the steak was somewhat viscous and excellent.  And, Drawn Butter for the  crustacean was tasty until it grew cold.  The busy restaurant was out of warmers, announced our server apologetically.  Sauteed Button Mushrooms yielded a very good side, and so did a platter of thin buttered Green Beans mixed with quite a few slices of mushroom.  But had I known that these greens would come with mushrooms, I probably would not have ordered a side of mushrooms, as well.  We finished with Chocolate Lava Cake that came with Vanilla Ice Cream and Chantilly Whipped Cream.  It was a tasty end to a fine meal!"}
{"text":"Second visit was worst than first.  My wife and I celebrating our anniversary wanted a special night out at a fine restaurant.  What we got at Fleming's was a treatment, no treat.  We made reservations for 6:45p, showed up ten minutes early to ensure our seating on time.  When we arrived, we were told our table was being cleared and we would be seated in about ten minutes.  At 7:15, we were still waiting.  With the restaurant jam packed with people stacked at the bar, lounging in the entry way and packed in the dining room, it became obvious that reservations had been overbooked with little chance that anyone would be seated any time soon.  We left, sadder but wiser.  \"Fool me once, your fault.  Fool me twice, my fault.\""}
{"text":"Its a great place  any other day, on holidays  it is a different  story all together. Slower service , worse food, and a rude server. I understand  that Valentines Day is a busy day for them, but this was un acceptable. I will go back just. Because  how amazing  the other times were. May want to stear clear  on a holiday."}
{"text":"Gave it a second try. Food was a lot better and service was excellent again. Rachel was great! Thanks for having us back!"}
{"text":"Great steak!  After my recent disappointments in Vegas (Carnevino & Gordon Ramsay Steak...), I was due for a satsifying steak...  The cut could've been the best cut I have ever had of New York steak.  Zero stringiness in the cut!  The primest of prime!  The color of the pink was the same shade throughout: I was impressed with how consistent it was.  Steak cooked to perfection!    I just wished Flemings was closer to the Strip... it was about 20 minutes driving at light speed.. =("}
{"text":"The medium prime rib special dinner is really good. I highly recommend you tried the chocolate lava cake. The waitress is very nice and environment is good. In a total, a good place for dating and special event."}
{"text":"This restaurant has great service, ridiculously delicious steak options and a great location (Hildale Mall just off of University Ave) and a great happy hour. I recommend the \"when in Rome\" technique at a steakhouse and was extremely pleased with my main course. They had a great wine list as well (love the ipad there specifically to sort through the wines!) The brussel sprouts where ok, but for the price, I was hoping for something just a little better. My only recommendation is to bring a flashlight to be able to get around the restaurant, see your food and those sitting across from you at the table. I know that all steakhouses go for that that \"romantically dark mood lighting-thing\", but seriously Flemings, I banged my knees twice on booths trying to follow the waiter to our table. The food is so excellent, I think you can turn up the lights a bit so we can see what we're enjoying ;)  A great place for a date or to enjoy a classier evening out with friends/family."}
{"text":"I went here for Valentine's Day. Usually if I don't like a restaurant, I give it two stars. But for a $150 dinner and it's lacking quality I give it one. We had a reservation, the valet was nice. We were seating promptly. It took about fifteen minutes to get our drinks ordered, and another fifteen to get our drinks. I got lemonade. It tasted like watery lemon juice. There was sugar around the rim, which is fancy, but I would've rather had it mixed in with my drink. I ordered the grilled chicken and my date had a steak. The steak was good, the grilled chicken lacked flavor but it had a good texture (except the giant chunk of fat I found in it). We also got French onion soup as an appetizer. Dear god am I glad we ordered it. Not that it was exceptionally tasty, it wasn't, but it took so long to get our food if they would've have brought out the soup I might've starved to death. I'm not sure if they're always that busy because this isn't the kind of place you can go to very often due to the prices. Now, the French onion soup, it was more like cheese with a little French onion soup. It took probably an hour after the soup to get our meat. Since I didn't like it much, I was really hoping dessert would redeem the night. We wanted to order a few desserts, but they were out of all of the ones we wanted. We ending up only getting the turtle pie and creme brûlée. The pie was sickeningly sweet. I couldn't take more than a bite. It had a good texture, but it seemed more like cake. If it had half the amount of sugar it would have been good. The creme brûlée was the highlight of the dinner but there are other places to get a bomb creme brûlée without paying $150 for bad service and a sub par dinner. Overall, this place is totally overhyped. I guess the little scooper they use to clean the bread crumbs off of the table is good."}
{"text":"I was shocked at how good this place is. Management is doing  a great job. Food was great and customer service was terrific.   I loved the mashed potatoes with garlic!"}
{"text":"I had the best experience here at Flemings for my 51st birthday my husband to be there for the first time. Everybody was so nice and kind and the food was outstanding thank you so much Ray Ramirez our waiter he was so sweet and attentive can't wait to see you again thank you so much Mary Irby"}
{"text":"My first dining room experience here completely underwhelmed me!  The decor is standard upscale steakhouse white linen. Nothing stands out.  I had 2 small plates- lamb chops and scallops. There were 3 mini lamb chops and 4 so-so scallops for $22 each. I'd say overpriced for small portions that didn't even register as 5 out of 10 for me. The veggies with the scallops were pretty sad, and the side with the lamb chops was a little better- fried bread/cheese sticks that were tastier than the veggies. My beet/tomato salad was good, and the side of cheese with it was very tasty. The bread was served with 2 cheese/butter hybrids, which were tastier than most of the food I had.  I will stick with happy hour in the bar in the future!"}
{"text":"Food was perfectly cooked, we got the bone in filet and dry aged ribeye, ended with the lava cake and the steaks were a perfect medium rare, the lava cake was prepared to perfection.. Above all else our server Marco was awesome! Excellent customer service!"}
{"text":"Wow that quality of meat they have here is just wonderful. Portion sizes are perfect, not too much yet not too little. Service was an A+ ! Very attentive and kept our wines and cocktails refilled as requested. Will be coming back to try other great steaks!"}
{"text":"Flemmings was absolutely delicious. My boyfriend and I dined at Flemmings this past week for our anniversary. The server Bill was very helpful with the wine selection and I trusted his suggestions (he listened to what I was looking for and gave the perfection suggestion). We started off with a caesar salad which was the right amount of unique caesar dressing. We shared onion rings as well as the sauteed green beans with mushrooms (both amazing). He ordered the special bone in NY and I had the petite filet mignon. Both were mouth watering and cooked perfectly. We were too full to eat dessert (even though I wanted to). Bill brought out creme brulee with a candle and said we had to have dessert for our anniversary. This was the best creme brulee I have ever had! I must say, the staff was wonderful. Bill and his server assistant did a phenomenal job!!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to Flemings for at least 2 years. The last time was in California at the Newport Beach location. It was a week before my birthday, and I still haven't decided where I wanted to eat dinner that night. At first I thought, maybe I'll look at restaurants on the strip. Then I told myself, on a Saturday? Hell no! Yes, I am one of those locals who avoid going to the strip as much as possible lol. I thought about Flemings and how I have never ate at this location, so I decided to make a reservation here.   The first thing I noticed when we drove in was the valet. Seriously, does anyone else agree that the valet here is pointless? There are parking stalls very close to the restaurant and you don't have to walk far. Anyway, our reservation was at 5:00pm and we arrived about 15 minutes early so we decided to sit at the bar. They had iPad menus which you could use to browse the wine list and food options, which was pretty awesome. The bartender was friendly. She chatted with us for a bit and made us feel welcomed.  We were seated right at 5:00. The hostess asked us if we preferred black napkins because some people don't like the lint from the white napkins getting on their dark clothes. This was the first time I was given a napkin color option at a restaurant. We told her that the white ones were fine. The food was just as good as I remembered. I ordered the Petite Filet Mignon. Yes, its a pretty small steak, but I like to leave room for some sides and of course dessert for my birthday! My steak was cooked to perfection - mouth watering, easy to cut, juicy and full of flavor! I ordered a baked potato as my side because their Chipotle Cheddar Mac & Cheese had scallions in it that were pre-mixed. :( Sorry, not a fan of onions, scallions, chives, etc. My husband enjoyed his Main Filet Mignon as well. He also ordered the grilled asparagus as a side, but didn't like the taste of it. For dessert, we got the Chocolate Lava Cake, which is always very delicious! It is a little rich, so its perfect for sharing.  30 minutes into our meal, we looked over at the bar, and it was packed! Happy Hour here at Fleming's must be very popular! They should really consider expanding the bar area to accommodate the large crowd. Service was very attentive and excellent. The manager even stopped by our table to wish me a happy birthday. At the end of our meal, our server gave me a complimentary box of truffles as my birthday treat. How nice!   This place isn't cheap, but it was worth the money. I would definitely come back again in the future for a special occasion!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Although it was a bit pricey (which was expected), the portions were actually bigger than I expected. The Fleming potatoes were to die for. Steaks were cooked to perfection and had great flavor. Our waitress was really good and even gave both me and my boyfriend complimentary dessert chocolates for our birthdays which happen to be two weeks apart from each other. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Fleming's in a number of years but on our most recent visit I was pleasantly reminded what I was missing.  We came for a work dinner during the holidays and the restaurant was packed for a Thursday night. We were seated quickly and service was beyond attentive despite the crowd. Refills were plentiful and our food was well-paced.   We started with a handful of appetizers including the calamari and the pork belly, the pork belly being my favorite. For my entree I ordered a bone in ribeye and we shared one of each of the sides from the menu. The Femings potatoes, mushrooms and mac and cheese were among my favorites. My steak was perfectly cooked and enormous. I had to take more than half home with me since I was so full.   Despite filling up on the first two courses, we powered on and ordered two chocolate lava cakes and they were delicious. Not overly sweet, the flavors  really complemented each other well.  I do see my self coming back to enjoy their happy hour again soon."}
{"text":"I had my wedding reception here after a few visits on my own and then a few tastings. Used the back private room, had several dishes to offer...a really wonderful experience with outstanding food and service...  It a foodies delight."}
