{"text":"Great non-trendy breakfast joint. Don't be fooled by the latest spot around the corner that charges double and gives you half the portions. If you want basic breakfast done right, come here."}
{"text":"Wow, that peameal bacon sandwich! They say that the neighbor Carousel Cafe has the best ones but I disagree. It's these guys! 

My experiences are only from the take out counter. I have no complaints, it just is so so yummy. There usually is a queu during lunch time. But service has always been friendly. I don't know about you guys but I keep coming back here!"}
{"text":"Okay food, horrible service.  Came here for an early lunch on Saturday and saw that most people were having breakfast.  The waitress came around and took our orders, I ordered a reuben sandwich and my wife had the liver and onions.  Just after taking our order our waitress we saw our waitress sat down at the bar to eat her lunch and we waited forever before our food came.  Some people who arrived and ordered after us had finished their meals and left and we were still waiting for our food to arrive.  The waitress didn't tell us anything about lunch items taking much longer, otherwise we would have just ordered breakfast.  I was able to flag down another waitress who finally brought us our food. My reuben was okay and my wife's liver was not bad but it was not hot at all. It seemed like it had been sitting out for a long time waiting to be delivered to our table. Still not too bad, but hen I walked to the bar to pay the bill I saw our waitress (still sitting at the bar eating) and she asked how the food was and I politely told her it  was good but the liver was not hot.  Instead of being in any way apologetic she was argumentative, insisting the food was not cold.  Okay. But she was still very slow to give me back my change.  She still felt very deserving of a good tip despite the non existent service, cold food and very rude behaviour.  It's really a shame that a place with a great location and not bad food is ruined by terrible service."}
{"text":"I've been here for lunch several times both take away and sit down. 

3.5*s
My most recent experience was surprisingly good. I usually get the chicken souvlaki pita. The chicken is tender with great seasoning. Fries aren't anything to write home about, but the tzatziki is pretty darned good.

Something about their beer on tap just doesn't taste right. Maybe it's a turnover thing (or lack of). I suppose I should stop ordering the beer..."}
{"text":"I had a breakfast bun with home fries.  The bun was good, nothing too out of the ordinary.  The ham was a bit too chewy.  The potatoes though were really good, crispy and full of flavor.  The patio is nice though it was an extremely hot sunny day and there wasn't an umbrella covering my seat.  I was ready to leave quickly!!"}
{"text":"Great for a casual brunch or lunch. Eggs Benedict is good and so are the burgers. Comfort food done well."}
{"text":"I've been in the downtown core for a number of years, but have never tried the famous St Lawrence peameal sandwich...until now...  it was amazing, had a cold pint of Organic to wash it down."}
{"text":"This place is great, the service was fast and very friendly. We had breakfast here, and we'll be back again cuz it was the best I've had in town. Tried both benedicts and the pancakes, it was all awesome."}
{"text":"As always good, decent food but oooh so slow even when less than full on a Saturday. Why charge $ 0.75 for a coffee refill? Nobody else does, to my knowledge. 1st cup was gone by the time the food arrived. Pay up, buddy. \"I will have to add $ 0.75 to your bill now.\" NOT ACCEPTABLE."}
{"text":"Great brunch place. It can be a bit busy on the weekends but we've only had a long wait once. Their eggs Benny are awesome"}
{"text":"Loved this breakfast spot. Who doesn't love the energy at a market? Paired with perfectly poached eggs for the Benny and a true Grand Slam. 

THE START
Greeted and sat at a table for two. Restaurant was a local diner feel with just the busy amount of people. Not a crazy line or too quiet that it feels like mid day 2 - 5 rather than morning breakfast. 

SERVICE
Our waitress was very pleasent. Executed beginning to end of serving with ease and perfection. 10/10

FOOD
Portions are average to the hungry eye and overly generous when comsumed. Eggs benny was done perfectly. My bf's order of the Grand Slam came with everything. Coffee was average. Not botomless. Still, bang for your buck.

THE EXPERIENCE
Great! Would not travel all they way there in this freezing cold weather from where I am but when I am in the neighborhood a definite yes!"}
{"text":"This was the second peameal bacon sandwich I tried at the St. Lawrence Market.  It was made to order and had delightful caramelized parts on the meat, which added to the flavor.  They also have an assortment of toppings that they put on for you.  At the recommendation of the girl behind the counter, we added onions, peppers, and honey mustard.  What a difference!  The onions amplified the flavor of the meat, and I was very pleased by the sandwich.  I wish the bread wasn't so dry though, but I think that might just be the type of bread that they use for peameal sandwiches."}
{"text":"For a year I was just passing by this location and I can say that I didn't regret trying their food! This is my go-to Tuesday breakfast place!! Service needs a little bit improvement, but I don't really mind. They serve great breakfast with an affordable price!"}
{"text":"Stopped in today for the first time after doing some shopping at St. Lawrence market.  Sat at the bar, thinking I'd relax, have a beer or two and maybe read the paper.  Unfortunately the bartender (platinum blonde) decided she'd rather chat with the regulars than bother serving me.  She looked over, but not a \"Hello, I'll be with you in a minute!\".  Nothing.  I sat there for nearly 10 minutes, put my coat back on and left.  She couldn't have cared less.  Was there a secret password I needed to know?"}
{"text":"This review is for the restaurant and not the take out counter. Apparently this place is really known for its peameal bacon sandwich. Since everyone raves about it I suggest ordering from the takeout counter rather than dining in the restaurant or trying other items. like we did.

DECOR
Small throwback to diners past and tucked away the front of the south building at St Lawrence market. The place is getting a little run town with stick tables, walls and curtains that have never been washed, very old cutlery that is becoming pitted... which contributed to its vintage vibe. It's kind of warm and comforting, and kind of dirty. My wife and I went here around noon on a Saturday. Surprisingly we were immediately seated considering the market was very busy that day.

FOOD
We started with two glasses of orange juice; which to my knowledge, was freshly squeezed and quite good.

My wife had the California benny which came with smoked salmon on top of a usual eggs benedict, along with homefries. She liked her meal but noted the home fried were soggy and there was substantially too much hollandaise sauce on her eggs. It looked good, minus the sea of sauce, but I didn't try any of it (allergy). 

I had the BLT with homefries which I thought was a safe bet but I was wrong. The bacon inside my sandwich was under cooked and almost all fat. I ended up taking it out because it was greasy and disgusting. That left me with a sandwich with lettuce and tomato. There was 3cm of lettuce in the sandwich with two paltry sized tomatoes slices between 2 pieces of dempsters bread. Being located in the market I was really expecting bakery quality bread.  

The homefries were undercooked, soggy and unevenly seasoned (some pieces were a salt/seasoning were encrusted while other pieces had no salt/seasoning whatsoever). The coleslaw that accompanied my meal was brown from sitting out too long.

Presentation for each meal was standard for a diner. Slopped on an overused greying white plate.


SERVICE
Terrible. The only good thing about the service was we were seated immediately. I'd suggest this is a fluke because every time I have passed this place before it was packed. Our order was taken by a surely and unfriendly waitress and our OJ came in good time and then we waited almost 45 minutes for our food. During that 45 minute wait no one came to check on us or let us know why an eggs benedict and a BLT was taking so long. When we finally got our lukewarm food, no one bothered to check up to see if it was okay (mine wasn't). I could have complained but we wanted to get out of there and be on our way in the market. 

There are a lot of great food options in the market, especially with all the new restaurants opened along Market street. Paddington's isn't the best restaurantin the area and wouldn't even make my \"10 Ten\" list for diners in Toronto. Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Took my girlfriend to Paddy's Pump, and the server was stellar.  Warm, friendly, attentive.  My first visit the only thing I didn't like was that the service was rather unattentive.  Well, switch to a new server and what a difference it makes!

I'll just assume the first server I had was having an off day, and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I ordered the Oink on a bun and traded half for the Schnitzel my wife ordered. We both decided we liked the Oink better than the schnitzel.  The poutine fries were crunchy and overall very good. Not a heart smart meal but...."}
{"text":"Here's The Real Deal 

First off this place is one busy place especially on Saturday morning !!! 
This is a Breakfast place and in this writers opinion The Best Peameal Bacon Sandwich in the Market :-). There are other things on the menu and it is all made fresh. The Kitchen staff has been there for years so they know how to cook. The Owner Bill and his sister Effi now run the Family business. 
In the 17years I've been eating there I can say I have never had a bad meal. 
Summertime they have a great patio right on the the side of the market and its licensed for alcohol. So if your looking for cheap eats this is your place.
See you there. 

Now that's The Real Deal. B"}
{"text":"I eat breakfast here regularly.  Either the OINK (peameal on a bun) or the Breakfast On A Toasted Rye.  

Family run, old skool place.  This place gets very busy though.  Inside there's a restaurant, and outside there's a fast food counter.  Summer patio with beer.  Best patio in the area."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Good service. Benedict is to die for. Average to lower pricing.

Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Lovely place right next to St Lawrence Market. Had an amazing Oink on a bun (best name) with a really good poutine. My wife had a eggs Benedict with fries. And it was night! All day breakfast. Gotta love it."}
{"text":"I noticed that the other reviews gave no higher than 3 stars.

My daughter had a grilled chicken salad. My son had a corned beef sandwich, and I had a tuna sandwich. Kind of hard to mess those things up. I am giving the restaurant a high rating for the  fries and onion rings. They were superb, crispy and tasty. The poutine was also very good. The service was not the fastest, but also not the slowest."}
{"text":"My husband and I really like this place.  We have tried their Schnitzel and Steak sandwiches and they were really yummy.  We always try to grab bite to eat at Paddington's when in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"A group of 6 of us ate breakfast here on a Monday at 9:30.  None of us had the oink!  One of my friends reported, however, that the regular bacon he had was the best of our weekly tour of 28 (so far) breakfast spots (greasy spoons or diners).  So I guess that says something.

My eggs over easy were done right, the toast was a step up from brown Wonder bread, and the coffee was stock diner fare.

Our waitress (originally from Columbia) was sweet.  A perfectly good breakfast, but nothing to write home about (except, perhaps, T's bacon)."}
{"text":"Fantastic for a quick and basic breakfast. The prices are incredibly reasonable. Staff are friendly and efficient.

Great eggs benedict for under $10 - what more can you ask for? The pancakes are phenomenal - fluffy with a tender outer crisp.

I'm a regular here and will continue to be!"}
{"text":"My favorite eggs benny in the city. The hollandaise is intense: super creamy and thick. You may want to order it on the side instead but trust me, you'll want to dip everything in it. The homefries are done right here as well. Plan for naptime afterwards :) Super casual atmosphere so, don't expect anything fancy. Total greasy spoon joint."}
{"text":"Tried the peameal bacon sandwich....unique sandwich. Love that they toast the bun and the bacon on the sandwich was delicious!"}
{"text":"Whether it's breakfast, lunch, or a couple of cold ones at the bar I love Paddington's Pump. Located on the west side of St. Lawrence Market it can fill up for lunch or late breakfast, especially on Saturday so plan to arrive early.

They make a decent burger, but the real star is their Back Bacon on a Bun. While not quite as great as the Back Bacon sandwich at the Carousel Bakery down the hall, the Pump's version of this perennial Canadian classic is quite good. 

The breakfasts here are generous with heaps of home fries, market fresh bacon and sausages, and eggs. All that, and the coffee ain't half bad either. 

For lunch, try one of their sandwiches. I really like their BLT which is generous with the bacon and veggies. 

If you just want a cold one at a reasonable price, pull a stool up to the bar and rest an elbow, they have a good selection of local craft beers."}
{"text":"I only come here during patio season, it feels kind of dank inside.  The service is alright but I feel like they've all been working their for years.... for the price vs. portion sizes I'm always satisfied! This was my go to pregnancy breakfast spot! And their pemeal they must get from the market, yum yum yum."}
{"text":"On my recent trip to Toronto I was interested in trying the local favorite called the PEAMEAL BACON SANDWICH.  After having several, I have decided that my favorite was from Paddington's Pump.  Now for those of you not familiar with PEAMEAL BACON it isn't like regular bacon.  It's more like Pork Roll or Taylor Ham that we have here in the North East.  It's sliced but slightly thick and covered with dried and ground yellow peas. I walked to the counter and saw that there we a bunch of accompaniments that you could get on the sandwich.  Lettuce, tomato, onions and a bunch of sauces in squirt bottles.  I asked the gentleman what the traditional way to eat it.  He said just plain piled on the bun was fine but he liked it with mustard.  I went with the mustard.  This is such a simple sandwich (peameal bacon, mustard, bun) that it is very surprising just how tasty it is.  Then again...bacon.  I would highly recommend that you try several of these around the city on your trip to Toronto and be sure to stop by Paddington's Pump to give theirs a try."}
{"text":"Good prices and food, huge portions. The server was excellent, she noticed our food was taking a while and checked on it for us and gave us an update."}
{"text":"Cheap food: check.
Alcohol: check.
Magical angel servers who somehow keep on top of everything even when the place is packed wall-to-wall: check.

Get the Eggs Benedict, some freshly-squeezed OJ, and watch as your hangover magically drifts off into space like a nightmare you forget as soon as you wake up. 

If you're feeling particularly peckish (and maybe a little masochistic), get the Reuben. You're lucky to finish the whole thing without at least once leaning back into your chair, groaning, and rubbing your tummy in the hopes of somehow genie-ing more room for this monster of a sandwich. Oh and it's delicious, so. There's that.

Listen guys, you get what you pay for at most places. At Paddington's, they give you more. Sure, it's a greasy spoon, but since when is that a bad thing?

Just trust me."}
{"text":"Every time I have shopped at St. Lawrence Market, I have ordered a peameal sandwich from Paddingtons and the sandwich was great. 

Friday I had a different experience. When I watched 1 guy except everyone's cash, goes from doing that, to cleaning the counter, to cleaning the condiments, to wiping his hands on his shirt, to touching sandwich's. That is disgusting. Not buying food there again. Not recommending anyone to buy from there. Might not be a big loss. In till you give someone food poisoning.

Clean your damn hands!!!!"}
{"text":"Went for brunch. We love in the area and frequent the market. I had the chicken blt which was standard. I ordered a poutine with it but my server came back and told me they were out of curds. No big deal so I ordered gravy instead. However, the gravy was gross. Thick and had a weird taste. Hubby sent it back. 
We sat near the entrance which was ok except the door kept popping open on its own due to the blustery day. 
I gave 3 stars because the food was \"meh \" but the service was fantastic. I'll likely go back just because of that and the location. 
Food was a little pricey for what it is but typical for the location."}
{"text":"Travelling from Europe it's quite difficult to find quality foods here; especially when you don't know anything about the place you are. After an online search I went to the St Lawrence Market to get some fresh fruits, vegetables and tapas as the reviews claimed that's the place to be for quality. I decided to take a break and eat a little something... I have to say, everything looks good in there! I found Paddington's in a little corner of the market and Oh My!!! First proper hamburger I ate here in Canada. Definitely a place to go to when you have the munchies... it looked so tasty I couldn't wait to take a bite."}
{"text":"Pub diner in St.Lawrence Market. Perfect place to have to bunch on a Saturday morning.  I love the Classic Eggs Benedict although the home fries just lack a pinch of salt. Great portion, must come !!"}
{"text":"I would give zero stars if possible. I tried a peameal bacon sandwich from Carousel and enjoyed it so much, i went back to the market looking to get another. I found the market closed, but Paddington's Pump open.  I was seated quickly and my order was taken quickly.  This was the highlight of my visit.  After getting my coffee, my waitress never came by to check on us, despite the fact that the restaurant was half full. Also, it took an hour to give us our order which was a simple sandwich with home fries.  I received no explanation for the delay other than they were \"busy\".  I actually saw the staff tell at least 4 different customers that came in after me that the wait was 45 minutes even though the restaurant was full of empty tables. To top it off, when the sandwich did come the home fries were cold, the bun was verging on stale, and the the peamal bacon was virtually non-existent.   I have read other reviews, so maybe this was just an isolated incident.  However, I will never go back to this place and cannot recommend that anyone try this place.  Happy eating."}
{"text":"I don't understand half of the reviews on here... This place is exceeding expectations for the kind of restaurant that it's meant to be. I go here to eat so I rate the food 5 stars. That's all you need to know. You want eggs? Peameal bacon? Potatoes? Pancakes? Hell yes this place is my breakfast spot. I live in the area and I've tried a bunch of places but this place has the BEST eggs Benedict by far. Thanks for making my breakfast choice easy."}
{"text":"Good breakfast, the only sit down place at St Lawrence Market. Peameal breakfast sandwich - amazing! Strolling the market afterwards made everything just right!"}
{"text":"Fun brunch and great service.

Thank you, Isabelle, for the great and fun service we had this past Friday. Your personal touch really made our brunch fun and enjoyable.

And yes, the food was good too. Standard fare, but all well prepared, no complaints. Everything hit the spot, including the onion rings and club sandwich. Comforting comfort food all around."}
{"text":"Don't assume the food here is crafted from the bounty available in the market. They don't even have maple syrup, only table syrup. Potatoes are weak and their cheeses are a marginal step above processed. Decent service though."}
{"text":"When I worked downtown, I would sometimes stroll over to the market at lunch and get peameal bacon on a bun from their take out counter. Back then (about 6/7 years ago) it was really good and you got a whack of peameal! Now, although it is good and you still get a fair portion, it is not as good or as big. 

Even though there is always a lineup, I am tempted to try anther vendor to see what the competition has on the grill."}
{"text":"Decent food.  Lots of regulars in the dining area. Seemed like a very relaxed dining experience but I wouldn't return since didn't wow me."}
{"text":"came here for sunday brunch. Good for big portion filling and satisfying breakfast for a good price. I would recommend sharing if you have a smaller appetite. Very country old school rustic feel."}
{"text":"If you want your peameal bacon sandwich to come with a chair and a beer (and maybe the person you're with wants breakfast) you can do a lot worse than this eatery in the corner of the south St. Lawrence Market. 

This place is basic, and all the more relaxing for it.  Turn up, grab some chairs and a table, and pick something off the menu - but if you don't get the famous \"oink on a kaiser\", don't tell them I sent you."}
{"text":"We stopped here on a Monday - 6 of us looking for a delicious breakfast. Not crowded - thought we'd be in and out like any other breakfast place. But the service was beyond horrible and 50 minutes later we didn't even have our food (which has eggs Benedict and an omelet.) Stay away!!"}
{"text":"Omg!!! After walking around trying to find a local place to eat I decided to settle for padding tons and boy am I sure glad that I did. We both decided to get the bacon cheeseburger I got some pea meal thing with mine (Canadian bacon) and boy did it make this American happy. 

I wish I could say I'll be back but I'm leaving tomorrow to go back home. 

Pro tip: if you're offered gravy with your fries say yes."}
{"text":"I feel this place is surviving on reputation and good portions. The food was average at best, I had the grand slam which was two eggs, sausage, bacon, home fries and either  pancakes or french toast,  I opted for pancakes at the waitress recommendation that they were larger and more filling.


They were two massive round pancake which came with side of butter and syrup. This was probably the only real sour spot of the meal,  wasnt much taste to it and it was light or fuffy like you expect but the portion kind of redeemed that but not quite,  alot of meh food doesnt equal less of good food/

The eggs were cooked fine and bacon was crispy and I didnt hate the home fries like i would usually but in the end it was decent meal, good price and portion but i wont be rushing back. 

Service was non existent outside bringing the food, couldn't even flag down the waitress to get more coffee but maybe i got wrong waitress, the other waitress who was heavy set women seem to be great with her customer based on what I had observed."}
{"text":"Great prices, good service and the hollandaise sauce on the Benny,   amaazing! Only dissapointment were the hash browns were undercooked potatoes"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch to try out the egg benny. I ordered the west coast, egg benny with smoked salmon. The potatoes can use more flavour. The hollandaise sauce was very rice and tasty. 

All my friends loved the fish and chips! It has a nice patio so not a bad idea to give it a try in the summer as it is right at the st lawrence market."}
{"text":"Good was awesome.   Service was great.  This is the perfect spot to grab breakfast.  My fiance and I stopped in here the day after a marathon and sampled a few different entrees.  We had marathon level appetites so one dish each wasn't going to be enough.   It was all great. Come here hungry, order a big breakfast and enjoy.   They have lighter fare too, but who wants to go out for breakfast and eat light?"}
{"text":"I have bought sandwiches from the counter but the best item I've had here was a Reuben sandwich at the restaurant about a year ago.  Went well with a pint!  The service was very friendly.  

If I ate out more often for lunch, and thought of this place, I'd happily return."}
{"text":"I would always order Breakfast on a Bun from Paddington's whenever I was in Toronto. Great sandwich!  This last visit, only a week ago, I experienced the same thing a previous reviewer detailed; no hand washing.  The same guy handles food, money, and who knows what else. I have taken my future business elsewhere."}
{"text":"I love this place! We stopped in to escape the cold and were waited on by the sweetest waitress who was from Colombia. I ordered the chicken and rice soup and the chicken sandwich and everything tastes great. There's really not much to say except the food was great and the Staff was friendly."}
{"text":"I have passed by Paddington's Pump many times recently while at or in the area of St Lawrence Market. Admittedly, I was a little concerned about a few very negative reviews on Yelp, but was downtown this morning and decided to give it a try. While I cannot say there is anything special about the place, I certainly did not have any problems with cleanliness or poor service. It had the feel of an old neighbourhood pub, a little worn but not run-down. There are a couple of TV's, some classic rock music playing in the background, and lots of dark wood so that it is not particularly bright inside. The service was friendly and reasonably fast considering the constant flow of customers.

The menu is pretty standard for breakfasts with no fancy sides or options; I really didn't look at the lunch/dinner menu, but I know that they promote their peameal bacon sandwich at the take-out counter, and seem to have a decent bar. I had the French Connection breakfast. The 2 pieces of French toast with maple syrup and the bacon were quite good; the 2 eggs and sausage and home fries were okay, while the toast was a little lightly done but still okay. The coffee was pretty good, but I was a little surprised that they charge for refills (although only $0.75 so not a big deal). Overall, the food was fine and certainly a good-sized meal for only $14. I don't think I would make a trip there just to eat, but would certainly return if I was in the market area."}
{"text":"not really much of anything - just sub par breakfast food - was really hoping for something special"}
{"text":"Very, very slow service.

The waitress told us immediately that the kitchen was short staffed, but waiting for the food took way too long... Especially for diner like food.

Portions are very generous but I wasn't blown away by the meal. You get what you order: eggs, bacon, toast, sausage, pancakes, coffee - you can't really mess that up.

A heads up to the home fries though: they're not what I expected. These were basically boiled chunks of potato tossed in seasoning while I expected something crispier.

A good place for hearty weekend brunch but don't eat here if you have a tight schedule!"}
{"text":"I'm a big Pagginton Bear fan so I knew I had to check this place out.  Unfortunately, I made my first and last appearance here.  Everything was awful from beginning to end.  

This place is definitely a hole in the wall with outdated decor.  But I'm not one to complain about that b/c I like grungy places sometimes as they're often hidden gems.  Not this one though.

No one seats you (at least no one sat us), we just found a table.  Service was slow as heck, I thought we were invisible.  We had to flag down the waitress multiple times for basic things (i.e. filling up coffee, ketchup, our bill!).  My friend got eggs and she said they were pretty standard.  I had fish and chips.  I could barely eat it it tasted so bad.  It certainly wasn't made fresh, as it tasted like it had been sitting in the freezer for awhile.  

This place should be called Paddington's Dump."}
{"text":"I would suggest you go anywhere else other then this place. The place is dirty and the cooks extremely dirty, took a look behind the counter and one guy looked like he had never cleaned his apron.

The chicken on the club seemed like it was a week old and they just grab it out of the fridge and throw it on. Club is the easiest thing to make in the world but somehow these guys absolutely demolished it. Seriously it was just disgusting and the draft beer was warm and the taste also seemed off , most likely due to them never cleaning I assume.

If you don't like having diarrhea then don't go to this place."}
{"text":"I ate in the market side...so didn't enjoy the full experience but the sandwich was ok...maybe a little better than ok but nothing to special..would try something else if I went there again."}
{"text":"A great greasy spoon type place that makes just about the best peameal bacon sandwich in the world.

Course, I expected that from the number of \"What the hell do you mean you've never been to Paddington's?!\" I got on Twitter after musing about breakfast ideas around the market.

I sad at the bar and had a great conversation with the woman evidently running the place while waiting on my massive sandwich. And I think it all came in under $10.

The sandwiches alone are also sold at their stand in the market, which is great if you're looking for a to go item."}
{"text":"A friend, visiting from Brazil, really loves to try Canadian cuisine. Lo and behold, he and I found ourselves sitting at a table, just across from the Paddington's Pump's take out counter. I grew up eating peameal bacon sandwiches, it's good Canadian fare, and that's just what they were advertising. My friend had to try it! I can't give a thorough review of the restaurant, but I'll share a couple things. The women who waited on us was very pleasant indeed, and the peameal sandwich was delicious! I will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Well, the legendary Paddington's Pump at St. Lawrence Market. One simply has to go there since one has been told of the legend of its peameal pork sandwich. :)  Well, what can I say, the legend is very true. :)

I went there on a Sunday late afternoon, and was surprised to notice I wasn't the only patron. The place has the look of a pub but the feel of a diner. You get the feeling that it has a ton of 'regulars'. And as a first timer, I was made to feel totally at home. I'll be coming back for sure. The waitress who served me was super friendly and very helpful in answering all my questions so +1 for the service too. 

I got the classic oink sandwich, which is peameal pork and cheese on a Kaiser bun. That came with fries and coleslaw and was more than enough food for one person. The meat was a bit salty to my taste, but not a deal breaker. It's not super expensive either, with a soda the bill came out to 12.50 with tax. 

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Peameal bacon sandwich and a beer. What more can you ask for? 
This place is a great little dive nestled in the St.Lawrence Market, which is a whole lot of fun to explore on its own. The food was good and the service solid. It's a bar, so if you're bringing little ones consider getting your food to-go and sitting at one of the cafeteria style tables around the market."}
{"text":"Came here after realizing that the St Lawrence market is closed on Sundays (whoops). My husband wanted a pea meal bacon sandwich before leaving town and he was not disappointed with the one he had here. I had the Montreal smoked meat sandwich which was also very good, saw some amazing looking breakfast plates getting delivered to surrounding tables as well...with heavy emphasis on the meats, I would say! Coffee was actually quite good (I'm accustomed to rather bad coffee at diner-ish places like this). Low-key and casual,loved the old building (it's inside St Laurence Mkt, first floor) with all the exposed ductwork, and wood moldings. Prices were very affordable and the portions were generous, you will not leave here hungry! Service was friendly and efficient, our server checked in often to make sure all was well. The wait for our order was a bit long, really the only negative I can cite---may not be the best place if you are pressed for time."}
{"text":"This place is a standard diner style restaurant serving up breakfast, burgers and other traditional diner fare. 

I ordered the eggs Benedict with the hollandaise on the side. 

Eggs were cooked perfectly over soft and poached as ordered. Their pea meal bacon was also really good and their English muffin was perfectly toasted. 

Home fries were great. Nice and crispy as I like it. All in all good value for quality. 

Will definitely try out some other thing next time I'm there."}
{"text":"My review is for the takeout counter in the back. Ordered a burger and was told it would take 10 minutes. I said ok because I thought 10 minutes isn't bad. Now if the cashier had told me 30 minutes, I would've declined and gone elsewhere, but she didn't say 30 minutes, she said 10. Thirty minutes later, after watching everyone that ordered after me get their chicken sandwiches and peameal sandwiches and tuna sandwiches, and after the condiment lady went off to do something else because my burger was taking so long, and while I was considering canceling my order and going somewhere else, my burger was finally ready. I asked if the burger was frozen, and the cashier said no, it's an 8 lb burger so it takes a while to cook. I'm pretty sure she meant 8 oz. Also, I know what an 8 oz burger looks like, and this wasn't 8 oz.

You might be thinking, \"Stop whining, it's lunch time, what'd you expect?\" To that, I say, \"If you're busiest time of day is lunch, you should be equipped to cook people's lunch while it's still their lunch hour.\"

As for the taste, you'd expect a burger topped w/ peameal bacon and cheese to taste awesome. Well lower your expectations to gas station hotdog levels and you won't be dissatisfied."}
{"text":"Good food, service is questionable... 2.5 Stars

The breakfast on a bun and pancakes were great., but...

 I had asked for well-done homefries, which the waitress agreed was the way to go and they arrived not well-done.

We had to ask for maple syrup twice.

There was also a hair in my coffee and we had to ask for cream twice.

Next time, I would stick to getting peameal sandwiches to-go."}
{"text":"I go to Paddington every so often for breakfast when I'm working in the area. I usually get take out. This morning I decided to go and have a nice sit down meal with my boyfriend. We were quite hungry and excitedly anticipating our (usually good and well priced) meal. After waiting 15 minutes, we were finally asked out order. It was 30 minutes until we got our food and the waitress was \"reassuring\" us that our timing was good because the people beside us had waited an hour. That was no reassurance at all and did not make me feel any better. When we finally got our food, the eggs were undercooked to the point where the whites hadn't even turned white and the pancakes still had batter in the middle and were raw. Completely unsatisfied and we will not be visiting Paddinton's again any time soon."}
{"text":"I came here not expecting anything special... and even that expectation wasn't met. The food was ok, but the service was terrible. Our waitress forgot almost everything we asked for, and seemed really inconvenienced when we would politely remind her of things she forgot. 

While our service was slow and uncomfortable, the layout of the place has tables packed in so tightly that you're often wiggling around to let other diners be seated.

The idea of sitting down in St Lawrence Market sounded appealing to me. In hindsight, it just ended up being annoying. You're way better off grabbing your peameal bacon sandwich at any of the other vendors in the market and eating while you walk around."}
{"text":"Came by on the Thanksgiving Saturday for a quick meal before a pie making class upstairs. The food was pretty satisfying a filing but the wait time really dampened the experience.

Staff: They were friendly and felt that they were attentive to our needs even though it was somewhat busy. There were even many times while I ate that someone would check in on us and two seconds later another staff member checked in on us, which can be a bit repetitive. Unfortunately, I wished the wait time wasn't so long. We probably waited almost 30 to 40 minutes from the time we ordered our food to the time we got our food. As I waited, I looked around and noticed that we weren't the only ones waiting. It was a good thing we had arrived early to the market and wasn't in a rush yet.

Ambience: Seating was very close to other tables, so people had to brush up against others/table quite a bit to get by. It was also quite loud but it was a busy Saturday at St. Lawrence Market so I guess I can't expect too much. It seems very small and the added décor made it seem even smaller than it probably was. It addition it seemed a tad on the darker side and I felt maybe a fresh coat of paint could revitalize it.

Food: The food was well priced and you got a big hefty portion. I had the Lumberjack Sandwich, which I had misinterpreted that it came with homefries on the side, but in actuality it came with homefries IN the sandwich AND on the side. SO MANY POTATOES! That was my own fault of course, and it was still yummy nonetheless. I may have to come back for one of their other sandwiches because they all looked delicious. I would mentioned that it was salty for me, but I prefer low sodium, so take that statement with a grain of salt (Boo-yah! Nailed that pun.)

I would say if you're in the area and wanted breakfast food, this is a great option, but I would suggest to take it to go."}
{"text":"This place has the best peameal bacon sandwich anywhere in the city.  Walk on up to the counter, ask for the peameal, get the hot mustard, and be on your way for a tasty treat."}
{"text":"This is like a 2.5 star place but it's open o. Sunday unlike the st Lawrence market and it's a simple breakfast place / bar. No real complaints. Just don't expect much.

I'm giving it a three stars because the servers are always very pleasant to talk to. Coffee is good."}
{"text":"Ohhh yes best place to eat on st Lawrence Market !!!
Customer services is nice !!!
Cold beer !!!!
Hot coffee !!!!
Bathrooms are just ok !!!
Food was delicious and good prices !!!! 
Parkin across street !!!!
Pea meal bacon was on point !!!!!
Accept credit cards master card and visa NO AMERICAN EXPRESS !!!!!"}
{"text":"I did not have high expectations for this place but a few friends have recommended it as a good spot for breakfast. I did try to come here one afternoon before the Jays game but the server said food would take 40 mins so we left. I finally got to try it over the weekend! We came around 9am on Saturday and the place was pretty packed. Our server came by to take our drink orders and food. The customer service was great I would have to add, and the food, was good. I don't think you can screw up breakfast. I had the french connection which was 2 pieces of french toast, eggs, bacon, sausage (which I subbed for ham) and home fries. I'd have to add that their home fries were really good too!

I would definitely come here if I had a big appetite. I had way too much food!"}
{"text":"I had a peameal bacon sandwich for the first time. I am not sure what the hype is all about. I am not a big fan of sandwiches. Maybe that it is why. The sandwich is huge though! It is definitely an item you can share."}
{"text":"Ate half a peameal sando here because I thought it was Carousel. It wasn't.  I thought it was a good sando.....until I tried Carousel. I wish that the pork was more tender and the bread did not compare to Carousel."}
{"text":"Stumbled onto this place, sure glad we did. Good food at good price. Lumberjack sandwich was very good, including the peameal bacon. Potatoes were excellent, and the sauerkraut was interesting. Burger was good quality, BBQ chicken wings very meaty and tasty. 

Soft drinks served from a can. Friendly service. This place feels like a local hangout from the elderly lady eating alone and talking to herself to the cook hugging people to the local guy waving to the servers as he stepped through the door and the 20-somethings guzzling beer at the bar."}
{"text":"I went to this place for breakfast and I have three words for it GREaT CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! We ordered their 5.95 special of two eggs, home fries and toast. Just because the waitress was 2 minutes late bringing out our order she gave us two free coffees and two free eggs!!! We were pleasantly surprised. Three eggs are a bit too much if anyone is trying to watch their cholesterol but who can say NO to free food! Such a cute diner!"}
{"text":"Not a bad spot to grab a quick bite and enjoy the people watching at St. Lawrence Market. The prices are fair and the food is decent. It's not the best I've ever had but it's far from the worst.

I'd rate the club sandwich a solid B, maybe a B- since they throw some pickled coleslaw on the plate and it invades the bread with pickley-moistness before you can eat the second half. Not cool, coleslaw."}
{"text":"Paddington Pump is a great little greasy spoon on the corner of a main road but that seems to still manage to be in a relatively quiet area. The food on offer is reasonably priced, tasty and served with sass and professionalism. I had the eggs benedict with home fries and it was one of the best brunches I'd had in a long while, and the freshly made iced tea was a nice change from the usual Nestea rubbish you get in most places. The cafe has a nice outside section with a few tables so you can people watch whilst having a bite or a local ale. Great stuff, would definitely come back next time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"Great place to grab affordable breakfast with quality ingredients. Although I came for breakfast, I couldn't help but have to have a sandwich. Dining space can be a bit cramped, it doesn't get quite busy. Menu has a variety of different breakfast options including pancakes, eggs Benedict and meat lovers. Their portions are generous and their service is quick. 
Would definitely come back for some breakfast and a light meal."}
{"text":"I've had plenty of Time to write this review, been sitting in the washroom... my intestines aren't thanking me for this visit.

The service was friendly and that's it... always looked like a seedy dive and our suspicions were confirmed...

My brother got the Wednesday special \"hot turkey and mash,\" he's one to never complain, but it was that bad that he complained, to me at at least. The veggies are frozen and reheated, confirmed by staff. The turkey was dry despite being drenched in \"gravy.\" He thinks the mashed potatoes were real potatoes though, but they weren't pleasing either.

I had the safe bet western omelette I added cheddar cheese, which tasted, if you could find any taste after consuming the oil drenched thing, like cheese whiz.  

I ordered a salad and she sold it as a side, saved $3, thankfully. But that wasn't appetizing either.

They had to make me fresh coffee and that was decent.

All in all, you've walked by numerous times, I highly recommend you keep doing so. Numerous establishments around. I even suggest starvation would be a preferred option than eating here ever again."}
{"text":"07/31/15;  we have eaten at paddington several times, and never been dissatisfied. the service and the food was top notch.  i had the eggs benedict firm with smoked salmon which was great.  our friend mary had a standard breakfast of bacon, scrambled egg with cheese and home fries. she was thoroughly satisfied with that meal.  my sister had the blt with fries one day and then she had a grilled cheese with friesthe other day.  we have been satisfied with our meal at paddinton each time we have had a meal there."}
{"text":"Rode the streetcar to the St. Lawrence Market with a goal of finding breakfast, and we were pleased to find Paddington's Pump. The French toast with maple syrup was really tasty, and the peameal bacon added just the right amount of salty to the dish. One of us had sausage with her French toast, and it was pretty good, but I liked the peameal bacon better! The coffee was good, but they didn't offer to refill my cup. One of us had eggs with sautéed veggies, and she enjoyed her breakfast as well.

It was fun to sit with the locals, watch the news, and enjoy the early morning happenings from the vantage point of Paddington's. The St. Lawrence Market was coming awake for the day, and vendors were preparing for business. Quite a neat way to start a day of exploring the market."}
{"text":"Simple diner food."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast places in Toronto.  They make real home fries; none of that frozen potato stuff from a bag.  The staff are all super friendly.  Also, this is my go-to place if I'm craving a clubhouse sandwich."}
{"text":"Very unimpressed with this establishment. Went on a Sunday not knowing the market was closed and this was the only place to eat that was open. The peameal bacon and egg sandwich on a bun was fine but the service was awful the place was packed and felt very dirty. Like, I'm all for a greasy spoon, but this place was just gross. Too gross to dine in. 

So, we got take out and the guy who took our order, handled our money, and picked his nose,  also prepared our sandwich. We sat outside on the restaurant patio on wet tables and chairs bc it had just rained. We were told to leave because \"outside food was not allowed.\" Meanwhile it was the food we bought for takeout from the restaurant.  The patio was empty so it wasn't like we were taking tables from dine-in guests. Just plain rude and unacceptable. Unsuspecting tourists, beware. Go somewhere else - anywhere else! Our city has so much more to offer than this dive."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Toronto for breakfast, I always get their Peameal Bacon breakfast sandwich which never disappoints wish the States could figure that one out as it's a winner. It'd probably be a pattern infringement as Peameal Bacon isToronto's signature sandwich. It is always busy but the service is outstanding with your order coming out if the kitchen in record time. Can not imagine a trip to Toronto without a trip to Paddington's Pump."}
{"text":"--- Food ---
My partner and I decided to eat here for brunch because it's a place to sit down and eat in busy St. Lawrence market. The food were all reasonably priced! He ordered an egg benny while I ordered one of the traditional breakfast options with french toast. 

Food portions were large. We were both stuffed by the end, should've just shared. The egg benny - hollandaise sauce was too thick. The roasted potatoes were okay - wasn't crispy. The french toast was decent though. Overall, the food is alright, good for the price! 

--- Service ---
We sat at one of the tables behind the bar, where the waitresses walk to go to the front entrance of the restaurant and to the kitchen. And one of the waitress kept coughing whenever she walked by us, it was quite annoying. We even asked our waitress to change seats after she coughed  +4 times. But our waitress said she can't change our seat since we've been assigned to her already. 

Our waitress wasn't that attentive. We had to wait quite a long time to get her attention to grab the bill. At one point she touched my back and I don't normally like strangers touching me... 

The menu was also quite sticky... they should wipe it down with a cloth. Also they don't stock up each table with the usual ketchup, maple syrup, cream, etc. We had to awkwardly reach across to share the items with our next table neighbours.  

--- Overall --- 
We would come here for the good priced food. But ... likely I won't come here again because we didn't really enjoy our experience here."}
{"text":"The Breakfast was good as always. Menu changed a bit, prices went up and you have to pay for a refill. 75 cents.  I guess its the cost of doing business at the Market."}
{"text":"Small place in the market that is open on Sunday.  Truthfully. OK like a fattier juicier cut of Peameal bacon and the tomato and shredded lettuce for me distracted from the taste of the meat.  I mean really, you are eating a mound of ham on a kaiser, are you really worried about getting in your veggies at this point?  I actually liked the lightness of the coleslaw and the mustard options were tasty and appreciated.  If Carousel is closed this place isn't bad, but my palette prefers the place next door."}
{"text":"This place is a little cracker. We went for lunch there yesterday while exploring the market. and we were certainly not disappointed. Very friendly and relaxed atmosphere, the service was spot on and we received V.I.P. treatment from our Server. We chose burgers and they were gorgeous. The meat was cooked to perfection, the only complaint was the portion sizes were huge and we just couldn't finish it all. Well worth the money and the visit, we'll definitely return when in the area again."}
{"text":"This review is for the paddington pump sit down restaurant. Service here was awful. There is a take away stand which I should've gone to. I ordered the breakfast on a bun sandwich and had asked for french fries on the side. They ended up giving me home fries and then our waitress disappeared. She never came around to ask if everything was okay or if we needed anything else. Halfway through our meal a different waitress came up to our table with the bill saying the other waitresses were saying that we had been asking for the bill (we hadn't since there was no one around to ask even if we had wanted to).  When we had finished and our waitress appeared out of nowhere to take the plates. No smiles, no customer service. I will avoid the sit down paddington's pump and stick with take away stand to avoid the unpleasant meal experience."}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken Parmesan and little did I know it wasn't made how it is traditionally so I took a bite it was COVERED in black peppercorns. I started to get my tongue irritated because I'm allergic to black peppercorn, yes I know I should have said something but I didn't expect that it would be made the mangicake style lol anyways the waitress was so rude to me after I asked her to ask the chef about the peppercorn chicken. This girl comes back and *claps her hand* smiles and says there isn't any peppercorns on the chicken\" so I did the same back at her and said I KNOW WHAT IM ALLERGIC TO AND ITS THAT! SO YOU'RE TELLING ME A LIE! I refused to eat it, I ordered something else but they still charged me for it. My boyfriend ended up taking it home when I know he shouldn't have but they should have taken it off the bill. I said very loud IM NEVER COMING TO THIS PLACE EVER AGAIN"}
{"text":"Delicious sandwich! The peameal was amazing with the addition of the home potatoes. I added a few peppers to my sandwich with mustard but it would've been fine plain. The sandwich was so flavorful!"}
{"text":"This is a Good greasy spoon kinda place for peameal bacon.  Good service and good breakfast!"}
{"text":"Service was friendly. Pancakes were amazing. Bacon was crispy. Quite small inside so if you have a group larger than four or five it might be a tight fit. 

Upon getting to the bottom of my plate I uncovered a nice, long, shiny, black hair. Appetizing! I told the waitress who looked mortified but instead of offering it on the house offered to make me a new meal. 

Lady I just ate half of this and I'm full. Offering me a meal of pancakes and eggs that I'll clearly have to reheat later is no good because reheated pancakes and eggs are no good. Stop being cheap. Your first move should be to offer it on the house. It was quite a disgusting sight to see hair in my eggs and syrup.

Wear hair nets!!!!"}
{"text":"On a recent visit to St Lawrence Market, a friend and I stopped by at Paddington's takeout counter to share their peameal bacon sandwich.  Peameal, which I hadn't heard of before, seems to be variety of bacon with a specific preparation method and rolled in pea meal (possibly corn meal nowadays).  Paddington's is on the second level, Front Street side, and has a restaurant area in addition to the takeout counter.

The peameal sandwich comes as several slices of peameal bacon on a basic roll, on which you ask them to add from a selection of toppings, including tomato, shredded lettuce, banana peppers, relish, ketchup and mustard.  Overall, the bacon is good and the sandwich satisfying enough, but nothing special and I'd try another place next time.  Bread didn't do much for the sandwich, might have improved it if toasted."}
{"text":"I went here for breakfast and I ordered an omelette  There were WAY too many onions in it and the swiss cheese left me with a very awful taste in my mouth. So much that I couldn't finish it and gave it to my boyfriend who had to lather it in Ketchup to mask the taste. 

The homefries were either burnt or hardly cooked at all. I didn't eat those either. 

And 2.75 for a very sour tasting freshly squeezed orange juice? Give me a break. I would of rather a Five Alive for 50 cents. I was most excited about the orange juice and it just was just as disappointing as the rest. 

I will not be back."}
{"text":"For one of the \"best breakfast places in Toronto\", this restaurant was super disappointing. 

The only thing my family and I enjoyed about our meals was the bacon (we didn't try the peameal bacon - just regular bacon). It was delicious! However, the pancakes were not light and airy at ALL. They were very dense. I could probably throw it at someone and injure them. I did get real Canadian maple syrup ($1 extra) which was good as well. The hash browns were huge chunks of under-seasoned potato.. gross. And the eggs? First, I was told that \"cheese can't go into the egg pan\", so I'm assuming it doesn't get washed too often. And since cheese can't go into the egg pan, I was brought scrambled eggs with 2 cold, unmelted pieces of processed cheese sitting on top. Really? 

The service was okay. The location is good, and the St. Lawrence Market itself is awesome. Overall, I probably wouldn't come back here."}
