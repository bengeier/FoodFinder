{"text":"For a while now I was eagerly awaiting the opening of Butcher and the Rye as I have enjoy my trips to Meat and Potatoes for both food and drink. So on a Thursday night I headed over for a few drinks.   Upon first entering, the place looks great - nice atmosphere, modern meets butcher shop in the woods - and then you come upon the wall of whiskey...holy smokes. So I walked over to the bar to grab a drink....and thats where it started to go south...  Now I came to check out the whiskey and they do have a very impressive collection - in fact one of the best that I have come across. I enjoy the brown liquors in all forms and really enjoy those times when I run across something new, especially if it is something that I say \"wow, I want to own a bottle of that\", so when I run across a place I can dive head first into trying, I'm in heaven.   I asked for whiskey menu and was handed an iPad - cool idea to convey info about the booze and a way they can keep it up to date with what they have - except that it seemed like not even half of bottles were on it. Ok - first week, I can excuse that a little but not totally - if you are a touting your collection, get your menu right before you open. My friends and I tried to ask about a few different items behind the bar and one of the responses we were given was \"you'll have to ask (guy with the hat), he is the guy that knows the stuff the best\" - really? 400 bottles and only one person is knowledgable enough to answer questions.   Then came the sticker shock - their prices seem like they were set and they multiplied 2x. I have been to other places in this city (and others) that have a some of the same items and they were charging double for it. Now I realize that if you have a bottle of X and it is not something you will sell everyday so it will cost you a little more to keep it around, but when a 1 oz pour of that drink runs $15-25, it's putting a night of sampling in the $80-100 range for 4 oz of booze. I don't to sound cheap and I have my spent a fair share of money on good bottles over the years, but thats just it - I would rather take that $80-100 and go get myself a bottle - your atmosphere is not worth the mark up.   So my overall though is that they have a collection and just that - the place does not come across as someplace that you go to try and find new whiskeys, just a place to get a drink while staring at their wall of booze. It reminds me of the guy who owns 40 classic cars, but doesn't care to drive them.  I will say this, the staff was friendly and fairly attentive, so I don't want to sound like they were bad - they were good - same level I would expect in any place similar.   Now after writing this I might sound like a pretentious ass about whiskey (because I fairly new to a lot of it) - and maybe I am - but when I try and go someplace that touts their whiskey collection, I expect be able to experience new things while having a good time and not going broke. For me, B&R isn't that place...."}
{"text":"I really loved the decor and service. 3 out of 4 of us had a too salty experience. Brussels sprouts were over the top salty. Flank steak as well. None of us talked about it but I overheard one of our ppl saying he couldn't finish because of the saltiness. My husband and I talked about it later. Please correct this!  We want to love this place."}
{"text":"The food and service was outstanding! DO NOT MISS THE BONE MARROW!! Our waitperson Naomi was stellar. She was well versed in the preparation of all the menu items and her suggestions were on point.  I would suggest you make reservations at least a month before.  AI look forward to returning."}
{"text":"We had cocktails + three courses. All excellent, but I thought the cocktails and dessert were the most splendid. Almond paste cake with white chocolate mousse was divine. Halibut was very good, as were scallops [if you like cheesy risotto, youll be happy with that one]."}
{"text":"VERDICT:  A higher-brow, alternative to it's cousin down the street (Meat & Potatoes) with inventive small plates, and a truly stellar selection of bourbon.  SERVICE: Good, as expected for a place at this price point. Servers are friendly, attentive, and will bring you an iPad to browse their extensive bourbon list. We were seated at the bar while the rest of our party arrived and were seated as soon as our table was ready, so no complaints here.  FOOD: I was here with a larger group (8 people) and would absolutely recommend doing it this way. Butcher and the Rye has a variety of small plates and the more people you have, the more you can try, without breaking the bank. Options run the gamut from French Onion soup, to sashimi, to pate, as well as more exotic game, like rabbit and quail.   The sashimi held its own against offerings from Umi or Penn Avenue Fish Company, and the ponzu sauce that came with it was different and delicious. On the meat front, the pate and pork terrine were tender and flavorful; the braised beef cheeks in the Shepherd's Pie and the flank steak were of high quality, but over seasoned. For a cheese course, we elected to have the baked camembert, which was forgettable, and would definitely have benefited from the addition of some honey. I did not sample, but heard good things from my fellow diners about the brussels sprouts and the mac n cheese.   My one general issue with the food was that a lot of it felt fussy and overcomplicated, with ingredients/garnishes/reductions for the sake of show rather than flavor. The quality of the ingredients is excellent, and I feel the food could stand on its own with fewer distractions.   AMBIENCE: Butcher and the Rye has a lovely rustic, yet modern/trendy feel to it, with a juxtaposition of wood and metal. The wall of bourbon is a focal point in the main area and wooden benches add a welcoming country kitchen feel. The semi-private room at the front is bounded by floor to ceiling windows. If it's cold out, it can get pretty chilly, so plan accordingly.  BOTTOM LINE: Skip it if you are a picky eater, but for those with an adventurous palate, it's definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Awesome place, food also good~ Only problem is too loud but acceptable"}
{"text":"I've always loved this place. Their whiskey/scotch selection is always great. And their food is always changing. Fresh yummy ingredients. Plus, whoever decorated their place has a great sense of outdoor style."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our dinner very much. We started with a whiskey flight.  It consisted of 1-ounce servings of Kentucky bourbon, an Irish, and a Japanese whiskey.  Neither of us are whisky drinkers but thought if we are ever to enjoy a whiskey this would be the place as they have 500 whiskeys on hand.  And talk about top-shelf!  The bottles behind the first floor bar (there is also one on the third floor) are on shelves that extend up three stories.        We did enjoy the whiskey flight experience, but it was because of the atmosphere, not the whiskey.  This is not the fault of the restaurant.  We just are not whiskey drinkers.  We'll get wine or beer next time, both of which we enjoy.  We were seated on the top floor of the three-level establishment adjacent to the bar.  We had early reservations so that we could enjoy a leisurely dining experience.  And enjoy we did. We ordered bread (accompanied by three spreads), Caesar salad (w/kale, not romaine), mushroom soup, and two short plates--pig candy and grilled Brussel sprouts. We shared everything.  Everything was very good.  My wife ordered the mushroom soup and as it turned out, it was my favorite item even though the pig candy was as good as other reviewers say.  The mushroom soup was the best I've ever had and it may be the best soup of any kind that I've had.  We will return."}
{"text":"Nothing was horrible, but given the hype, the price, and the quality of it's sister restaurant (Meat & Potatoes), we left very unimpressed.  I really debated between 2-3 stars, but I really felt that the tagline that accompanies 2 stars is pretty accurate.  \"Meh. I've experienced better.\"  Crispy Pig Wing - this was probably the best dish of the night.  Tasted kind of like sweet and sour chinese pork.  Summer Squash - there was barely any squash on the board and consisted of a bunch of sauces smeared around, definitely not worth it!  Bone Marrow - at first, we were impressed by the size of the dish, but after taking a few bites, we were again very disappointed.  There wasn't much flavor to the bone marrow.    Beet Salad - a very meh salad.  consisted mainly of romaine lettuce.  Steak Frites - decent, nothing special.  At this point, though we were pretty disappointed with the entire meal and were hoping for something more memorable.  We also ordered drinks, all of which were decent and probably the only thing I would suggest coming back to Butcher and the Rye for.  The decor and space are great.  (Except that it is a tad bit on the dark side, so you can barely see what you're eating...)  The atmosphere is fun, but the food just wasn't very good.  I really wanted to like this place, but I'm going to suggest that you only come here if you're looking for a place to grab drinks downtown in a nice setting."}
{"text":"Great place to see if you have not been.  Loud and moving atmosphere with tremendously diverse food selections. My tummy was in heaven!  Shishito peppers and Brussel sprouts are the best."}
{"text":"Everything - the food, the ambiance, the service, the bourbon - is out of this world here. I had to book reservations far in advance, but it was worth the wait!   Food - get the pig candy appetizer. The combinations of flavors involved is mouth-watering and unique. I also had the dirty pasta - delicious ground duck and cheese. My partner had roast chicken stuffed with mushrooms and more chicken under the skin (druxelle). It was quite good.  Drinks - if you like bourbon, you absolutely must go here. The list is extensive and has many rare options. The lions tail cocktail is done well (though Tender's is better).   Service - exceptional.   Ambiance - intimate upstairs, social downstairs   So, get yourselves a reservation here and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Food was simply amazing. Family style, so go with a group of people so you can sample a lot of things on the menu. Only weird thing is the ridiculously short doors in the women's bathroom so people can see you pee. Pro tip: There's a stand a lone handicap bathroom, use that instead."}
{"text":"My go to restaurant every year for my birthday...  It is my favorite restaurant in the city of Pittsburgh! Whenever I go- I HAVE to get the tartare. It is the best tartare I have ever had anywhere. Try it! You will not regret it! The pig candy is also a favorite!! Food is delicious- I recommend getting a bunch of small plates so you can try as much as possible :) -  If you truly like whiskey, this place is for you!!! Awesome decor and cool atmosphere too! If you haven't been here yet, you're seriously missing out!  Also, even if you are full, get a damn dessert! Seriously/ they're that good!"}
{"text":"One of the city's best. And at ~ $125/person (a few drinks, bottle of wine, appetizers and dessert), you certainly get what you pay for. Our party of four had a late (9:30) dinner reservation on Saturday night. Stretched out until nearly 1am. Prompt, friendly hostess. Patient explanation from a fun and attentive server (who mentioned how her boyfriend, a non-judgmental vegan, wouldn't be able to eat a single thing on the menu). Food highlights included the bone marrow and flank steak. The Moscow mule was possibly the best I've had. Decor is a gaudy hunter's party. Rumor had it that Sidney Crosby was dining at a back table. The stream of young women headed in that direction serves as partial evidence. Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable drinks here. I've been blown away by the cocktail selections and try something different every time based on my mood. From girly drinks to classic man cocktails, they've got you covered, but I think they specialize in the middle ground. Many of the concoctions I've never heard of or tasted anything like them before.  The upstairs cocktail bar has a special additional cocktail menu I was told is not available downstairs. All of the bartenders are extremely friendly and hilarious to have a great chat with. I haven't tried the food but have seen a few of the dishes, with an impressive sounding menu with impressively large portions for the price.  This is my favourite bar in the city for the incredible ambiance, which has got to be the best in the entire city, the cocktails, and the super cheap craft beer selections to end the night with. I've tried their house dark ale on draught, a rye porter, and will definitely be back for another serving soon."}
{"text":"Living in New York for ten years and coming to this place what a disappointment. Child like  portions with mediocre food, nothing stood out with the higher prices. There was no quality over quanity.  I regret ever coming here.     Two good things I will say the drink menu is good and our waitress was very attentive."}
{"text":"Had a Rye whiskey cocktail, of course, to start and it was tasty and came quickly. Service was excellent. I stayed with small plates, Pate, Tartar, MacnCheese, and the great Sunday Gravy. The only down-side was the dessert which wasn't on par with the rest of the meal. Overall, definitely will return, but will choose different Dessert next time. :-)"}
{"text":"My husband and I had a fantastic dinner on Saturday evening.  Our waiter was extremely knowledgeable and helped us make both food and drink decisions. When we couldn't decide on a bottle of wine so he  brought us a sample of one we were thinking of in order to make sure we would like it.  We ordered the artisanal cheese plate to enjoy with our wine and it was exceptional. The mushroom soup is poured table side and was incredible. My husband had the short ribs which literally fell off the bones as he was eating them. I had the scallops and blue crab risotto. Both were amazing and I would highly recommend both of them.  The atmosphere and service here was fantastic!!"}
{"text":"After falling in love with Meat and Potatoes, I had to check this place out, and I was not disappointed.  The atmosphere is noisy (in a good way) and trendy and off-beat.  Three of my favorite things.  The particular server we had was incredible - he was a wealth of knowledge that helped us make our drink and food decisions for the night.  I had two separate whiskey drinks that I loved - which is saying a lot since I don't drink whiskey.  The shining star of the night, however, was the food.  Oh my goodness the food.  Everything we tried - and we tried a lot - was flavorful and amazing.  The portions were perfect.  We didn't have leftovers, but we were still full.   We ordered the squid-ink pasta appetizer, I had the dirty pasta, my husband had the scallops.  For dessert I had a green tea pot de creme and my husband got the deep fried brownie.  Nothing disappointed.  I would go back there in a heartbeat, as there's so much on the menu I'm dying to try.  It can definitely get pricey, but for the quality of food, service, and fantastic atmosphere, it's worth every penny."}
{"text":"I think I would put this more at ALMOST 4 stars if I could.   We got there and the hostess was nice. We were seated upstairs at a good table and you cant deny the decorating is something to talk about (although get rid of the horrible painting at the bar). It did feel crowded, not because of the people but of how much stuff they have in there, but I get it.   Service: Our waitress was nice enough. Wasnt really able to tell us too much about the meals in detail but at least answered honestly when we asked if the coffee was good (not really), and she was right! Biggest thank you to her was not bothering us that I wanted only one glass of wine and he didnt want any. We traveled, we didnt want to drink and I know places that would have kept pushing it and acting annoyed. She didnt.  Food: Really good. I had the scallops which were good - slightly over done but cant complain. He has the Pot Pie - excellent presentation!  Bathrooms: Come on. Nothing trendy or fun about those. Saloon doors don't work when you're tall and trying to squat yet being able to see over the doors and therefore staring in the mirror while someone is washing their hands. Major fail.  Overall: Good food, would go back if I was in Pittsburgh. The roped off third floor was really weird. You don't find that in major cities so seeing that in Pittsburgh was a bit odd. Not sure what they are trying to show. \"Trying to hard\" was what I kept thinking when I saw that. Almost makes the place seem dated to be honest. Would go to eat and drink though."}
{"text":"Was in town for business. Not only did I treat myself too nice glass of Pappy van Winkle 25 year I had one of the most sublime dishes I have ever had. Well done Butcher & The Rye. I am starting too travel to Pittsburgh for frequently for work....I will be there every time I am in town."}
{"text":"Atmosphere and staff were phenomenal. Started with the mac and cheese and brussels. Honestly some of the best mac and cheese i have tasted. The brussels were cooked to perfection and seasoned wonderfully. Moved on to the seared scallops this dish was also perfectly executed. Finshed with a smore desert which was simply delicious.  Worth every penny and we will be back!"}
{"text":"They had an extensive whiskey menu, and my boyfriend tried several good Bourbons.  He liked that the selection was on an iPad, and he could systematically choose his drinks.  He enjoyed the pork belly appetizer and beef tongue ravioli with a cream sauce  The food was tasty, but very rich.  I was a bit less of a fan only because I am less of a meat person, but that is only my particular taste.  4 stars based on my boyfriend's opinion."}
{"text":"I give this five stars because of the drink - Maid's Wonder. I was with a group of four others and none of us really liked whisky/scotch. It was my graduation though, and I really wanted to go because I thought the bar with a wall of whisky and scotch was really cool. Personally, I had a great time watching the bartenders climb the wall. Anyway, the Maid's Wonder is my favorite mixed dream I've ever had somehow. It does not have a strong whisky/scotch flavor, but it is there and I actually loved the flavor in the drink. I also love lemon mixed drinks and cucumber, so this drink was perfect. Everyone else loved the drink after we each tried the first one, and they all ended up ordering one too.  On to the food, the Pig Candy was sweet and bacon-y, and I loved it. I got the special, which was a truffle pasta. It had a little too much truffle flavor after eating enough of it, but I still enjoyed it. One of the others ordered a burger, which I found weird with Burgatory and Stack'd around, and our plans to go to one the next day, and they later said the one at Stack'd was much better. They found the one here a little dry. Another said their brussels sprouts were kind of burnt.  I want to go back. They own a Tequila Bar which is attached to Butcher and the Rye, so you can order your drink at one then just walk through the hall to the other."}
{"text":"A bunch of us sat at the bar. The bartenders make this place awesome. The food was good but portions were pretty small. My flank steak was overdone. Butcher fell short of my expectations but I have been to some great places lately. Overall, a very good experience."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner at Butcher and the Rye last night. If I could give a 3.5 rating, I would, but am rounding up to 4.0.  The good: --The decor and atmosphere are a lot of fun --The quality of most of the dishes was very high. The Pig Wings were especially tasty and we also really liked the mussels, the octopus special and the eggplant special (all on the small plates menu). --The almond cake for dessert was great. --I liked the PunKing on draft (something new for me, almost more like a cocktail than a beer).  The less good: --The upstairs was noisier than I'd like--even our waitress commented on it--though I don't think that would stop us from going back. --My husband's Vieux Carre was pleasant but not outstanding.  The bad: --Our small table was ludicrously out of proportion with the very large plates some of our dishes arrived on.  Think tiny Parisian cafe table and square plates at least a foot on each edge (much bigger than needed to accommodate the food). We had ordered multiple small plates that were intended to be spaced out, but even so, we had to initially refuse one dish when it arrived because there was no place to set it. The plates we were eating from were of necessity so close to the edge of the table that if anyone had bumped the large plate in the middle they would have fallen off.  It felt like someone just hadn't thought this through. --The Brussels sprouts others have liked were a big disappointment (much too greasy).  Overall, we enjoyed ourselves, but the problem with the small size of our table did detract from the experience."}
{"text":"We went early on a Saturday night before a concert. We hadn't made a reservation so we sat at the bar, which was fine. The venue itself has a very interesting look, I kind of wish we had realized we needed a reservation at 5pm.  We ordered the octopus to start, which was lovely. The octopus was a little chewy but the accompanying polenta cake was delicious. We had the scallops on risotto and the halibut, both perfectly cooked and very good. The drinks here are outstanding: really interesting, delicious and a variety of choices. The only bad part of the meal unfortunately was the bartender. Since we were sitting at the bar, he was also our main server. We both found him rude, pretentious and unhelpful. It is really a shame because he took away what could have been a 5 star experience, despite the fact that we were sitting on bar stools. Oh well, maybe next time I'll come back but I'll make a reservation!"}
{"text":"I've only been here once but I'm already planning my next trip! Their scallop dish was out of this world and my fiancé was head over heels with their whiskey selection. Great for a date night, just make sure to make reservations in advance! I think I had to call and text to confirm in the days leading up to our reservation. They seem to fill up quickly, but that just goes to show how well they do!"}
{"text":"This place is great. From the cocktails to the meals. Limited dishes that are done spot on. However the only draw back is that it is hard to get into. That speaks for itself!"}
{"text":"Great cuisine and nice casual atmosphere. Loved the Cauliflower dish! They don't do substitutions so if you are picky or have dietary requirements you have been warned! Otherwise the dishes are beautiful as they are :)"}
{"text":"I travel the country and love to go to places with small plate options so I can get a sampling. The ones at this establishment would not be considered \"small\" anywhere else! The food is fantastic and service matches the level of quality. So glad I came here!"}
{"text":"After an interesting dinner and first round of drinks at Olive or Twist, my friends and I headed to Butcher and the Rye to escape the cheesy lounge singer playing on the first floor and the excessively sweetened drinks. We found a good spot at the bar and took a look at the drink menu. I had a perfectly made Boyd & Blaire dirty martini and the Witch Doctor. The surprise of the night was when our party of 8 was presented with glasses of champagne from an anonymous patron. Although the bar became a little crowded, the overall experience was enjoyable. I look forward to returning for dinner."}
{"text":"Wonderful place! The food was truly amazing as well as the atmosphere of the restaurant. My friends and I sat at the bar and had amazing service.  We ordered the Bone Marrow, MacNCheese, and tartare for apps. Incredible! The Bone Marrow had a mushroom-y taste to it so it wasn't like a straight bone marrow like Meat&Potatoes. Still good. Best MacNCheese in town, beating out the famous MacNCheese truck for sure. It had a perfect texture, not extremely cheesy, and great bread crust topping. The Tartare did not disappoint! Had a perfect flavor and smooth texture to it.   For entrees, we got the Dirty Pasta, Seafood (forgot what fish it was) and another dish I forgot the name of. All were amazing. Great flavor and great presentation.   I am definitely going back."}
{"text":"We visited Pittsburgh from Toronto and this was the restaurant I was most excited for. Unfortunately, I came away a little disappointed. We walked in with no reservations and were happy to get table upfront. We decided to order a couple of things and share. We started with the bread order and the gravy that came with it was delicious. Next up was the bone marrow,  I will preface I've never had bone marrow before. I thought I might as well try it in a place that people rave about it but it just wasn't my thing. Next was the pig candy which was different and tasty, I really enjoyed the side salad that accompanies it. We ended with the skirt steak which was delicious but a relatively small portion in my opinion.  The one thing that did ruin our experience was that we found the restaurant really hot. We were seated right at the front by the windows on a really hot day and found ourselves wanting to get out of there as quick as possible so we headed elsewhere to get get desert to cool down.   As an aside we went with two children and found limited options for kids, there was a burger special that they went for. Not a deal breaker and the main clientele but thought I'd pass along to other parents out there."}
{"text":"This place was a mixed bag for me. Firstly, the place was loud. If you're looking at coming here on a first date or to try and have a nice and quiet meal, I'd advise against it. I liked the atmosphere and the comfortable seats upstairs, but the noise was so overbearing from the bar that you can't talk unless you're raising your voice. That was the biggest complaint I had and the biggest reason on why I may not go back. The food: Pig Wing app: basically a very meaty rib served with an Asian flair. The rib was very tender and was slightly crispy in the outside. I thought it was pretty tasty.  Ceaser salad: the salad was pretty decent. Served with plenty of cheese and placed over a grilled piece of bread which I found to be a nice touch. Flank Steak: the steak was really good. It's one of he better steaks I've had in quite awhile. It was almost presented like a beef stew as it had potatoes and a gravy. It also had some blue cheese on it. That's never a bad idea with meat in my opinion.  Pot De Creme: this was REALLY good. Multiple layers of chocolate, whip cream on top, and a lemony cake of sort out on top. It was rich, but an exceptional dessert."}
{"text":"Incredible food and outstanding service ! Gotta go for the burger, they make only 20 a night or something shocking like that because they dont want to just be a burger place. And the ravioli with tongue might sound a little too out there but another impressive dish, the sauces were outstanding. Only reason I can't give this place five stars is several of the dishes were a little too salty (we were starving when we came in so we ate the brussel sprouts anyway and later we sent the fries back and they were happy to give us a fresh order). And the decour and scene is very fun. If you don't have a reservation, try the communal table, it's actually a great spot and the servers totally take care of you."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've had in Pittsburgh! The food was amazing. Each dish had a surprise texture or flavor. The cocktails are also some of the best that I've had in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Fantastic !!loved the marrow and beef tartare   Lamb entree was delicious   Everything was seasoned fantastic"}
{"text":"Amazing! I came here for a friend's birthday a few months ago. I absolutely loved the ambiance. Very dark and lots of candles. The food was delicious, and I especially loved the mac & cheese. The tartare was also exceptional. Will definitely be coming back here soon."}
{"text":"We really were looking forward to trying to place and unfortunately we attempted to the night of the Pitt-PSU game.  The place was super packed and unbelievably hot.  Plus there were quite a few people around that had been drinking for quite some time.  Tons of drunk people and no air moving in it= yuck!!!  The staff was awesome!!!  We did have a salad and a drink.  Both were great.  They have a great selection of drinks.    We would've loved to stay longer but between the heavily intoxicated people next to us and the smothering, stale air, we left for another late night place to eat."}
{"text":"The atmosphere of this bar is unlike anything PGH has ever seen.    The details of the decor are unbelievable and are unmatched in the city.   Wide Bourbon selection and a great menu.  Rarely overcrowded to make any visitor comfortable."}
{"text":"Went there before a show last night and was somewhat disappointed. I had been dying to try this place. Our server was nice but not vet attentive. The brussel sprouts were tasty and the highlight of the meal. We waited too long for them to bring our entrees out, and when they got to the table they were both luke warm. It's clear someone had forgotten about them and they were likely sitting under a lamp in the kitchen. The food itself was ok. My halibut was over salted and my friend's risotto was (for lack of a better term) eh. Probably not likely to go back. Better food in Pittsburgh exists."}
{"text":"Amazing food and bourbon selection. Beautiful venue. Loved the dirty pasta"}
{"text":"3 1/2 *s.  This is a tough one because Butcher and the Rye is a really cool place and deserves high marks for many reasons but unfortunately there were a few miss steps which prevent me from giving it the full four.  I have to say I loved the interior and design, it was definitely a popular, vibrant, lively and busy place.  It felt like I was at the place to be.     Where the restaurant fell down was firstly the lounge seating we were placed at, the low seats while comfortable for lounging and drinks weren't very comfortable for eating with a knife and fork.  Low to the ground and without much back support it seemed like an afterthought as additional seating for the overflow of diners.  Set on the upper floor in a dark back corner, although the service was just as good, I would much rather have been at a proper dining table and chairs.    The recommendation of lamb neck main was extremely disappointing with the best part of the dish being the beans.  No flavor whatsoever, yes, the meat was fall off the bone and tender but it was heavy, tasteless and fatty - I felt as if I was eating a mound of lard and concluded why I'd never seen lamb \"neck\" on a menu before.  Also, beware of what the waiter gushes about, this main instead of being the highlight of our dinner turned out to be the restaurant's downfall.  The service was excellent (except for the lamb recommendation), drinks were excellent and when my husband ordered something he didn't like the waiter was more than happy to change it - I think this compensated for the poor lamb recommendation.  Overall our appetizers, drinks, ambience and service were all solid.  Yes, if you're in Pittsburgh and want a good restaurant to try \"go\" but beware on the lamb neck (you don't need to be there for a bland piece of fatty meat - maybe they forgot to season it)."}
{"text":"The food here was absolutely fantastic! I got the bone marrow to start. The portion was quite large in comparison to other restaurants I've been to which is was a wonderful surprise. I will definitely be going back just for that. The only downside to the marrow was that the bones were too big for the appetizer plate and made eating it more difficult. Our group of four had nothing but great things to say about the food (Hanger Steak, Monkfish Osso Buco, Dirty Pasta and Beef Tongue Ravioli) and I cannot wait to go back.  The only other criticism was service was a little slow and missed small things like bringing a spoon for soup or a lot of downtime between drinks - but you could tell they were pretty busy on a Friday night. Overall though, pretty awesome place."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Excellent drink menu. Excellent decorum. And overall excellent dining experience."}
{"text":"Poor and dismissive treatment by the host.  We arrived at 7 and were told that we could be seated at 9:45. We gave our name believing we had made a reservation and held off on dining elsewhere.  When we returned at 9:30 the same host who took our reservation acted as if she had never set eyes on us, said we were not in the reservation book and showed no sympathy or concern.  Unacceptable."}
{"text":"(been here for work drinks in the past but just getting this yelp thing started:))  While waiting for a table at the sister restaurant Tako, my friends and I decided to grab a drink here. Pretty cool that they are connected by a doorway near the bar.  The whiskey wall is very impressive and dominates the main floor decor. There are apparently over 700 selections and they have an iPad you can use to search through while making your choice. The service was quick and friendly. Also, the bartender made some great recommendations. We had Four Roses bourbon on the rocks and Old Fashioned's made with Angel's Envy, both were excellent.   The hostess from tako came over to let us know our table was ready, nice touch! I really like this place and will be back to grab a full meal in the future. Definitely a big fan of Richard Deshantz's spots (tako, Butcher & Rye, and Meat & Potatoes)"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere!  Great food!   Great drinks (ie Loin's Tail)!   Great People all wrapped in a great city!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Fabulous!   Candy Pig was a fabulous pork belly that worked well with cilantro garnish.  Hanger steak was like nothing I have ever tasted.  Pot au creme for dessert. 5 stars.  These guys push the envelope."}
{"text":"Overall we enjoyed our experience at the Butcher and the Rye. James, our server for the evening, did a fantastic job. Had solid whiskey, cocktail and food suggestions. The food was very tasty but nothing wowed us.   I should note the evening did not get off to a positive start as the front of the house staff bungled our reservation. On arrival we were told the table we were booked in was still being used and were offered to wait for an indeterminate amount of time or eat in their lounge. We made the reservation about two months earlier - seemed pointless if the hostess treats the reservation as a suggestion and nothing more. We protested and were ultimately seated - to put salt on the wound there were about 4 empty two person tables in the dining room. While I appreciate that the restaurant needs to assign tables for a reservation, the restaurant could have easily moved things around and sat us at an empty table, rather than take the initial position that they did.   Fortunately, James and some tasty food redeemed the experience and overall Butcher and the Rye is worth the visit."}
{"text":"The ambiance is fun and lively. I was super excited about trying this restaurant but have to say I was a bit disappointed. Our server was very knowledgable about the menu but took a long time to return to our table. The a/c was not working well so the restaurant was HOT. This was very disappointing considering it is not cheap. Honestly the restaurant should inform you of this before making a reservation or when confirming the reservation. So shame on them! Plus they don't even have fans to make the guests more comfortable. As for the food, the duck liver pate is delicious. The seasonal salad with tomatoes and watermelon was very nice. The brussel sprouts are way too salty and lemony, as well as over cooked. The pork and lobster pasta was very good. The hanger steak was over salted. The cocktails were yummy! The desserts were very solid. Not sure I'll rush back."}
{"text":"slick, trendy, yet tasteful place! Head bartender Cecil knows how to shake a cocktail that'll take you right back to the prohibition! every plate we ordered was delicious, the vibe was sophisticated, but laid back. a great place to slink back into an intimate corner or bring the crew after working late. eat. drink. be happy!"}
{"text":"The food taste was so good.  But the quantity of the main dish food with $30 will still let you feel hungry.  The quantity of the food did not match with the price.  You should re-consider if this restaurant is worth for your family party."}
{"text":"MY GO TO PLACE FOR QUALITY DRINK AND FOOD: Food: 4.5 / 5 Drink: 5 / 5 Service: 5 / 5 Atmosphere: 4 / 5 Price: 5 / 5 Overall: 4.7 / 5  I've been to Butcher and the Rye 5 times and I absolutely love it.   FOOD: The food and the multitude of flavors in each dish is fantastic. My only qualms are that they over salt some of their dishes and the textural balance of their deep fried foods between the inside meat/seafood and outside skin is not always great.   All of their salads are WONDERFUL. You will never go wrong ordering any of their salads. My definite favorite dish is their Dry Aged Tartare, absolutely delectable with subtle sweet, sour, and salty flavors. My other favorite large plate is their Dirty Pasta.. amazing and satisfying. I pretty much would recommend every dish except the Rabbit & Dumplings. Don't waste your money on it because the rabbit is under seasoned and the dumplings are bland. The whole dish is kind of mushy.   DRINK: Great drink selection. Insane whiskey selection. All reasonably priced.  SERVICE: Waiters and servers are quick, fast, courteous and knowledgeable. Doesn't get better.  ATMOSPHERE: My only complaint is that it's loud and dark. Which is slightly annoying when I want to catch-up with friends who visit me in Pittsburgh and want show them this amazing restaurant only to have trouble hearing and seeing them.  PRICE: The quality of food, drink, and service offsets the price."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure if I was going to like Butcher & the Rye as much as I did, but I loved everything from start to finish. It was a belated Birthday dinner for myself by my mother in law. We had reservations made with a request for a non communal table and we were seated on the first floor in a corner of the restaurant, spectacular table to observe all the action going on around us. Decor was great, rustic reclaimed wood wall panels, mixed with a retro wallpaper, sort of a rustic cabin meets a speak easy. Service was great...maybe one of the best Manhattans I've ever had. My wife had the cauliflower appetizer that was great and I thoroughly enjoyed the pig candy, perfectly crispy pork belly. For the entree I got the short rib, which was excellent, but a little overly fatty it was served over a homemade version of baked beans and not your typical baked beans, not very saucy, but very flavorful. My wife got the recommended wagyu flank steak which was extremely good with its bacon vinaigrette and fingerling potatoes, my mother in law ordered the scallops over blue crab risotto which she raved of. It was a very good Birthday dinner and I will return!!"}
{"text":"In town for business and decided that this looked like a good place for some craft beers and a nice dinner. After sitting at the bar for 10 minutes the bartenders would not even make eye contact. I finally went over to one of the bartenders and expressed my displeasure. He said he would would be right back with us. Never saw him again. We left and expressed our displeasure with the manager on our way out. Three people behind the bar and we can't get a few beers on a Tuesday night. Not acceptable."}
{"text":"5 stars for food, 3 stars for cocktails, but since not everyone drinks, I'm sticking with the 5 stars.   The cocktails weren't bad, just unimaginative. I loved the whiskey wall; it was a thing of beauty, but the cocktails failed to wow me.   But the food, my goodness, the food. The gf and I ordered the focaccia, brussels, pig candy, wagyu flank steak (cooked rare), and dirty pasta. Focaccia was fresh and tasty, but nothing special. Pig Candy was better, but as a guy who eats a lot of pork belly, didn't  exceed my expectations. Brussels were delicious: I highly recommend. Dirty Pasta was rich and packed full of flavor. I originally wanted the Butcher Burger, but unfortunately did not arrive in time (7:45) to grab one of the 20 made each day. The Wagyu did not disappoint; I hesitated at first because I'm a snob about things labeled \"Wagyu\" (as far as I'm concerned, the only Wagyu I've ever truly had was in Japan), but I'm glad I ordered it because it was superb. All the flavors on the plate just meshed together beautifully.   Bottom line: Food was amazing, they know what they're doing here."}
{"text":"Everything was fantastic! We came here two years ago for restaurant week and I wasn't thrilled with a lot of what we had, so I wasn't sure what to expect on this visit. This time, everything was delicious and I can't wait to come back! My husband and I started  with the beef tartare and Sunday gravy and then for entrees had the scallops and pork and lobster pasta.  The sauce in the Sunday gravy was perfectly seasoned and we both agreed that we wanted more! The pistachio old fashioned cocktail I had was amazing and unique."}
{"text":"Service was slow. We sat for 20 minutes before server took our cocktail order. Cocktails were fabulous. 3 of 4 entrees were very good but not very creative. mussels appetizer and pasta entree (of which my friend ate very small amount) were tasty for a bite or two but very very salty. Items were not removed from check. We received a complimentary dessert to compensate. Fairly dry flourless torte but cranberry ice cream was delicious. We were surprised to see a cranberry dessert in july? we probably won't be back but it seems to be a very cool place."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere and great service. Went there with friends to celebrate my wife's birthday on a very busy Pittsburgh weekend evening. The restaurant was packed. Special shout-out to the hostess Jocelyn! She did an amazing job of seating us at a nice table. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"This was our 4th time there and they have not disappointed us yet.  We had 6 in our party this time.  We had various appetizers including the mussels, duck pate, pig candy, and sunday gravy.  Our dinners included scallops, short ribs, shepherd's pie, and the flank steak.  EVERYTHING WAS WONDERFUL!  Samantha was a great server."}
{"text":"What a fun and delicious experience! Of the items we tried, there was not a single miss. Favorite dishes: Crispy Pig Wing, Dry Aged Tartare, Rabbit & Dumplings, and Dirty Pasta. The nauti-mule cocktail was equally satisfying. I'll be sure to return to here when I'm next in the 'burgh!"}
{"text":"Absolutely spectacular as always! The brussel sprouts still take center stage as the best appetizer and the dirty pasta (while it isn't the most beautiful dish) was flavorful and delicious. The almond mousse cake was a perfect end to the meal, as it was large enough to split but not so rich that myself and my friend left uncomfortably stuffed. 5 stars for ambience, inventive dishes, and another wonderful evening out!"}
{"text":"We went before a weekday concert and we enjoyed our drinks. The food was reasonably good but pricy. The seating was uncomfortable upstairs. It was very dark and although I understand the need for ambiance, it was hard to read the menu. We were going to a show and gave ourselves2 hours beforehand to eat and when I politely informed our server of the situation, he acted rudely instead of offering reassurance. With so many other choices before show dining, it will be a while before we would go back. If on a second chance, the service is better I would reconsider because we liked the bar selections and the food was interesting and refreshing."}
{"text":"I have eaten here 5 or 6 times and it continually gets better . On my last butcher and the rye adventure I opted for the dirty pasta because I had heard so many great things about it. I can't even describe the flavor of this dish. Probably one of the best meals I have ever had... I wish I could put it into words but I can't you just have to try it. Don't be afraid of the duck, \"gamey\" is not the word I would use to describe this dish. My friend ordered the hanger steak (cooked to perfection) along with the potato soup. The potato soup presentation and flavor is to die for. The waiter brought out the bowl with the herbs and potatoes nicely arranged in the center, followed by a mason jar of the actual soup, then poured it onto the perfectly placed arrangement. The bacon confit combined with the herb flavors is a killer combo. I have stopped in here for some late night drinks as well, Cecil is probably one of the best bar tenders in the area. If you aren't picky tell him to surprise you, he won't disappoint! p.s check out their Instagram as well as meat and potatoes and tako if you need more convincing. This group of restaurants is by far my favorite in the Pittsburgh area."}
{"text":"I went to B&R with two coworkers who were visiting from another country.  We shared some appetizers (Tartar, Brussel Sprouts, Trio of Crostini), we each ordered an entree and a dessert.  Overall, an excellent experience.  The food was very good and I loved the cocktails."}
{"text":"My wife and I had probably one of the most sublime dining experiences we have ever had including travel to at least four other continents! The flavors of all the dishes were so tantalizing and complex. Our server James was very pleasant and personable with an excellent knowledge of food in general and specifically the menu at the restaurant. Previously you would have to travel to another country or to a very fancy restaurant with any hope of eating such well prepared food. By fancy I only mean incredibly expensive and stuffy. I think we are extremely lucky to have such an excellent restaurant right here in Pittsburgh. The spring onion and saffron soup was probably my favorite with incredibly delicious flavors complementing each other.  I was absolutely blown away by the experience and will return there again and again!"}
{"text":"The Dirty Pasta is literally life changing. I can't wait to eat here again!!"}
{"text":"Good food Great service.  We had \"Forest\" for our server tonight, he is fanatic makes our dinner perfect.  Thanks"}
{"text":"We've heard so many good things about Butcher and the Rye, and it did not disappoint.  The food, the drinks, the ambience, the whole package is very appealing.  I sampled 2 of the cocktails - there are so many to choose from and our waiter helped me to find a few options to suit my taste.  My husband is more of a beer drinker and although their offerings are limited, he found a few upscale beers that were to his liking.  Based on Yelp recommendations, we tried the Pig Candy appetizer.  I had the Scallops with Crab Risotto and my husband had one of their beef specials.  We also split a dessert, the daily special Pot De Creme.  Everything was truly amazing - very creative preparations and spot-on seasonings/flavors.  I would be remiss if I didn't mention the waitstaff - our waiter was excellent, as were the other employees who brought our food or bused the table.  Really an outstanding experience all the way around, I can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Maybe would have gotten 5 stars if there bathrooms weren't ridiculous (the pig pen style doors only come up about 3 feet so you have direct eye contact with anyone else in the restroom at ALL times- uncomfortable and so awkward)  That being said, our server was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. Everything our table ordered I loved (we chose about 6 small plates for 4 of us to share and it was the perfect amount) favorite= Brussels sprouts (one of their daily specials)  Could be considered a little pricey but I think it was worth it  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"If you are a whiskey/bourbon lover then you will love this place. Great selections of bourbon and rye: Jefferson's Presidential, Eagle rare, Pappy, WL Weller, the list goes on. The cocktails are also fantastic whether it's rum, vodka, bourbon, or tequila. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  I suppose you have to like meat and whiskey to give it 5 stars, but no way you could drop it less than 4.   It's always crowded and isn't a big space, so a little difficult to navigate inside.  But that's what you get when you have a good spot, lots of people want to go here.  Drinks are very good and most of the menu is great.  A few items could be nitpicked, but again I would never describe this as perfect cuisine.  The package of food, drink, decor, ambiance...all make it work"}
{"text":"The hostess was terribly rude and ruined our night. She laughed in our faces instead of greeting us. We should have just left. When we asked out waiter about it, he told us that she felt we were \"too excited to be there\". The food and atmosphere were great, but we won't return."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! A wonderful addition to the Pittsburgh restaurant scene. The warm ricotta appetizer is a must have! I had a pasta carbonara which was the special of the evening. It was wonderful. My friend had the Seabass. Also amazing!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed the small plates very much.  Particularly the mussels with red curry and pineapple, pig wing and pig candy.  The list of rye brands available was impressive and presented on a tablet which was very easy to use.  The server was very knowledgeable and helpful.  The decor was very welcoming and casual. Would definitely return the next time we are in Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"The highlights:  *Nearly unsurpassed whiskey selection. the bar is beautiful with the bottles lined up single file and illuminated along the back of the bar. Make sure you ask for the iPad with the spirits menu. They carry the entire Van Winkle line, several vintages of several Buffalo Trace Antique collection bottles, multiple iterations of Parker Heritage College, and many rare bottles like Michters Celebration, AH Hirsch 16, and Four Roses Marriage. All the whiskeys are available in 1 and 2 oz pours.   * The cocktails are interesting takes on modern classics and often feature neat house made components  * The decor is like an upscale resort hunting lodge with a very large antler chandelier.   * The food was in general very good. The specials are constantly changing and usually feature interesting highlighted ingredients like pork cheek, rabbit, Waygu beef, and diver scallops. Make sure you get the Focaccia and Brussels as starters  * Servers were useful with suggestions for food, drinks, and meal planning. They came by frequently to refill water and get drink orders"}
{"text":"Decent small plates. Would recommend the pig candy and dirty pasta. Great atmosphere and the best whiskey selection in the city. Good drinks, but the pretentiousness takes it down a notch. This is Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Where the drinks are exceptional and the ladies room is my own personal nightmare. I've never deducted a point for the height of bathroom room stall until now, but this is not the way I want to make friends. Go for drinks, but go to the bathroom with friends.... Or hold it until you get home. Again, drinks exceptional."}
{"text":"Decent but uppity food. We had a very nice server but the two person tables were so close together that they had to slide the table over for the person against the wall could get in. I don't particularly like eating so close to strangers that our elbows touch.   Again, the food was good but it was much fancier than I enjoy.    Beers are priced well."}
{"text":"The dinner was excellent. The charcuterie plate was outstanding. My entree was the flank steak which was cooked perfectly and was very yummy. I tried a bite of the burger, which was on special, and it was delicious! I can't recommend the restaurant enough."}
{"text":"The pig candy was AMAZING! We booked a 9:10 reservation (highly recommend) and had to wait a few minutes so we grabbed a drink at the bar upstairs. The restaurant layout makes for interesting conversation! We sat at the overlook on the second floor. The chandelier of the first floor was parallel to us which was made of deer antlers... very cool! The two-story whiskey bar-wall was awesome. They have an old-school library ladder to climb up and grab bottles. I would definitely recommend this place for a date to share plates because there are too many good options to just choose one!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to go Butcher and the Rye on NYE, and honestly I've never written a review that was negative towards an establishment based on service so I feel bad having to do this about an establishment that has such high ratings, but I don't want anyone else to get sick.  We ordered the bone marrow which was completely raw.  I'm an adventurous eater but this was extremely questionable. We've had bone marrow many times and it's always been a well cooked meat with nothing to worry about.  I served it to my girlfriend and a couple of my friends. I asked one of the waiters who wasn't our main waiter (who was incredibly kind and nice and understanding of the matter) and he said it's supposed to be buttery, but the fact of the matter is that it was raw. My girlfriend and I were the only two who were brave enough to try it because we thought there wasn't any issue, but it's about 30 min after the fact and we are both sick.   The drinks were bomb. The ambiance was amazing. The people were great. But the bone marrow was raw as can be. That's not okay."}
{"text":"Great meal and service. Strip steak & scallops were delicious!"}
{"text":"We were not disappointed...even with all of the hype!  My husband and I had a fabulous dinner in the Rye bar portion of this establishment.  Our meal consisted of focaccia, mushroom soup, brussell sprouts, scallops, and the wage flank steak.  We also  enjoyed an old fashioned, Pims cup and wine.  I would be hard pressed to pick my favorite part of the meal.  I implore you to check out this restaurant and enjoy their fabulous menu."}
{"text":"Butcher and the Rye is the second restaurant from the guys behind Meat & Potatoes. And it is just as beautiful as its sister location inside. The man behind the design is none other then the chef himself, Rick DeShantz. Rick and team paid close attention to every detail in the space and clearly understood that part of the battle of a great dining experience comes from the atmosphere.  I only explored the downstairs area as it was pretty jam-packed full of people. But the downstairs is sexy. It feels straight out of a Kinfolk magazine spread. Butcher paper on rollers with hand written specials hang from the wall. A wall full of spirits glow from backlighting. And a chandelier made from what looks to be barrel hoops is anchored to the far side of the bar. I'd live there. In a heartbeat.  And the menu isn't too bad either. I need to go back for dinner but the Onion + Brioche Soup and Mac-N-Cheese we sampled were both super tasty. I just wish there would have been more.  If you want to sit at the bar or communal tables, I'd suggest getting there as close to 5 p.m. as possible. If not, make yourself a reservation and soak up a little modern Americana."}
{"text":"Coming From Cali, to celebrate our anniversary and of course watch a steeler game.  Place is nice and cozy. Food is delicious. Mac n cheese get it! Oh and also the marrow!!"}
{"text":"I couldn't imagine giving this place anything less than five stars. Great food, great drinks and a great atmosphere.  Pig Candy. Beef Tongue Ravioli. Hanger Steak. S'mores. They were all delicious and I highly recommend each dish. The cocktails were also fantastic.  Overall, great experience. A reservation is probably a good idea, but definitely check this place out if you ever get the chance!"}
{"text":"We came here with our dog.  Thank goodness it was warm enough to sit outdoors.  Our waitress was friendly and helpful.  The food was to die for. The chicken tender juicy the steak cooked to perfection.  I would highly reco"}
{"text":"Good food, great ambience. The service was a bit uneven and bussing tables staff were too quick to clear our plates. We felt a bit rushed. The food was delicious but the pappardelle came to the table cold which is disappointing. Overall a pleasant experience and very interesting menu"}
{"text":"The food and drinks were superb. Unlike some restaurants, the careful preparation meant that the flavors were creative, well-balanced, and sophisticated instead of being superficially trendy and confused. I had the moonlight saunter cocktail, the beet salad, the hanger steak au poivre, and the s'mores. I would heartily recommend all of them, though I was seriously tempted by my companion's salted caramel apple dessert.  The service was friendly and efficient but not intrusive.  I had made a reservation, wondering if it was truly necessary on a Tuesday. Considering that most tables were filled the entire time we were there, I was glad that I did."}
{"text":"LOVE It!  Butcher and the Rye is my husband's absolute favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh.  We have tried pretty much everything on the menu and are always pleased every time we go!  My personal favorite is the Mac and Cheese!  The drinks are very unique as well, especially if you like whiskey!  The bartenders are very knowledgeable and willing to create different drinks if you tell them your preferences and price range.    Overall, we have celebrated birthdays, engagements, anniversaries and birthdays here and we will continue to do so in the future!  It is a great atmosphere and nothing like anything you will find in Pittsburgh.  Just make sure you plan ahead, because reservations are hard to come by!  They book up very quickly and you can't really just walk in and expect a table."}
{"text":"Started with the Pan drippings appetizer-basically just a loaf of bread and dish of gravy (albeit delicious gravy). Very simple and rustic. Had the punch drink special which was light and refreshing.   Now the star of the show: the Butcher Burger. If you think you've had a good burger, I guarantee you this one is better. The perfectly cooked meat is the star of the show but the lettuce, tomato, pickle and bun complement it perfectly. No ketchup needed!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing (particularly the brussel sprouts and mac & cheese) and the service was great. The leftovers we wanted to take home accidentally were thrown away so they made a fresh batch of both dishes for us before we left!"}
{"text":"Absolutely outstanding, fun and delicious place for dinner and drinks! The Rolodex of finely crafted cocktails was fun and all were tasty and exciting. We ordered several \"small plates\" which was plenty of food for two growing boys. Every dish was expertly crafted and even flavors that I don't normally enjoy, were turned into something scrummy. The Mac and cheese was hands down the best I have ever had in my life... Coming from someone that grew up on Mac and cheese!!!!"}
{"text":"I went for dinner with a Client last week while in town for business.  We sat at the bar and I immediately noticed the most impressive whiskey wall,(predominantly Bourbon) I have even seen outside of The Library in NYC.  They have it all.  THE STAFF: The female bartender Maggie was fantastic.  She was attentive, engaging and knowledgeable.  She spoke to us just enough to make us feel more than welcome without interrupting our business dinner.   The other bartender. Well, all I will say is he was not as interested in being there and seem liked he was having a bad night and wanted out ASAP.  But enough about that.   THE FOOD: My Client had the hanger steak and I had the wagu beef steak.  Both we amazing! Also very reasonably priced at $22 and $28.  Cooked to perfection, portion was perfect.  Absolutely spot on!   THE BOOZE: They have every whiskey known to mankind, and a very up to date prohibition style cocktail menu.  They have a great signature list as well.  Here is the issue. The pricing was beyond sky high! It was as, if not more expensive than Manhattan.  Actually it was like Dubai not Pittsburgh.   EXAMPLE: The Woodford Reserve Sonoma Cutrer Bourbon which is one of my favorites that Chris Morris of Woodford makes.  It's something I look for and generally,( from low end to high) around $18-$35. This is across the country, from LA to Denver to Houston and Boston.  I travel a lot for business and I can stand firm on this pricing model.  Well, here it was $90 for a two ounce pour. OUCH!! And most of the cool whiskeys like this were outrageous. I won't dwell on the negative pricing anymore.    IN CLOSING: I certainly don't want this to be a negative at all because I loved the place and will definitely visit again when I'm back in PBGH.  However their booze pricing needs to be examined. It was the difference between a 5 star review and 4 starts for me.  If they get the pricing to just industry standard, it will be a grand slam.  I also want to try their other restaurant Meat & Potatoes. I heard it was spectacular as well."}
{"text":"Amazing! Drove up from cleveland to try it...nothing short of awesome-what great atmosphere-everyone was so nice and the food...good lord. Bread-shishito-beet salad-halibut-smores! Your restaurant is our new destination-there are no negatives-LOVE thankyou for a great experience"}
{"text":"Great food and very good service.   The food selections are very unique. The mussels, bone marrow appetizer and beet salad was more than enough. Would certainly go again. -Hma"}
{"text":"I have been eating downtown for a few years and I just want to say how much I enjoy my meals at Butcher and the Rye. The food is consistently great. Also of note, the attentive staff. I most recently had server Stephaine. She went above and beyond with our needs.  Angela, another staff member, always seems to be there when needed.  The bar puts out drinks that are fun, approachable and creative. This place is a full-experience type of restaurant that runs as a fun, well oiled machine."}
{"text":"What a great find Little bit hard to find Google Maps sent us block away but we found it. Lovely small bistro like cafe. You enter trough a lively bar and are seated in one of several smallish eating area. Great decor sort of early hunting lodge with an antler chandelier, a stuffed bear and some mounted heads on the walls painted tables. Seating a bit crowded but that ended up being a plus as we had a nice conversation quite the table next to us. The menu is smallish but quite varied still in the meat & game style. The service was excellent our waitress was friendly informative and prompt. The food, which is really why you come was excellent. The crispy octopus was great. Nice char on the outside but very tender on the inside. The scallops with risotto were cooked to perfection. The rabbit dumplings were also flavorful well prepared. Dishes are small but satisfying. The deserts  were also very good the flourless chocolate cake and the apple fritters both topped with a small scoop of Maple Syrup ice-cream were the perfect finish. Overall an excellent dinner experience a nice finale to a great trip to Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"This company owns a few restaurants in the area. I personally thought meat and potatoes was better, but butcher and the the was a cool place. The food was pretty good and the way the bar is setup with a private upstairs area is pretty cool. The bartenders really care about the way the drinks are made and they had some impressive mixed drinks!"}
{"text":"Great food, though a bit pricey. Nice place for a date night."}
{"text":"Love Meat and Potatoes and finally got to try sister restaurant. Wife had the burger and I had the waygu steak. Both good. We split the country ham app and the deep fried brownie (recommended). If you like bourbon this is definitely the place for you. Pricey but great selection. I enjoyed the cocktails more here than  M & P but again I like bourbon. Food is good but M and P is better. Service and waiter's knowledge top notch"}
{"text":"I was in town from Los Angeles and wanted to go to a fun restaurant with great food.  This is the place.  We had a reservation for 8 but ended up with 10 diners.  They fit us in.  We shared several small plates and each had a main course.  Everything was excellent.  The wagu brisket is a must if they have it.  So are the brussel sprouts.  Drinks were well made.  I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"I travel to Pittsburgh frequently from Chicago and have enjoyed Meat and Potatoes on every single trip since I stumbled across that gem a few years ago. In fact, on two to three night trips, I have been known to go there each night (I see no need to venture out of downtown anymore with M&P right next to the Fairmont).  Butcher in the Rye is another excellent addition to downtown Pittsburgh. I ordered the flank steak and the mac and cheese - both were phenomenal. The steak was cooked perfectly with great flavor combinations of roasted garlic, potatoes,  liver pate, and some sort of delicious cheese. The mac and cheese was everything you would hope it would be.  It's a bit louder and a bit more expensive than M&P, but well worth it in my opinion.  I'll be back often!"}
{"text":"I've been looking forward to this meal for 3 weeks, since I made the plans to head to Pittsburgh. It was really delicious. I started off with the roasted cauliflower, Farro and carrot - it had a bit of a kick to it, and I don't care for overly spivey food, but this dish was phenomenal!  Next up, beef tongue ravioli - in an incredible stew, it was marvelous!  And the coqavin was my entree - delicious, burgundy base, tender meat complimented by roasted shallots, just delicious. The service staff was very knowledgeable and incredibly hospitable. Would definitely return again. Only thing that would have enhanced my experience would have been the cassoulet, which is actually the entree I ordered."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely the best!!  Not from the area and saw all the great yelp reviews.  I was with 2 girls from work and only seats left were at the bar.  Place was jammed packed. The menu was very interesting but ended up getting a few dishes which were amazing. I must say we were disappointed in the cold treatment of our bartender Courtney.  We are all pretty friendly and he was rude.  Something we all noticed.  The hostess wasn't much better.  Other than the service, this place is a must try."}
{"text":"I was visiting from Portland, OR and decided to try this highly-rated restaurant. The food was spectacular. We had the Brussels, cauliflower, pig candy and artisan bread to start followed by the strip steak and halibut. Then the pumpkin pie and almond cake. All were STELLAR. The Argentinian cab paired deliciously as well. The reason I'm not giving it five stars is due to service and comfort. They have these old, wooden, mis-matched chairs. I know it's supposed to be a Hipster, artsy type of vibe but it's not cool to be uncomfortable at a high-end establishment. The service there is decent but not great. I'm used to that with the indifferent, Hipster Millennials we have in Portland. But it would have been nice if they were a better-trained and more polished.   Overall however it was a very nice experience."}
{"text":"Acceptable, but uninspired food. Cocktails are the saving grace.  Tables upstairs are far too small. I give it a gentleman's C.   Minus."}
{"text":"Consistently one of the best restaurants in the region.  Superb food, excellent service and wonderful cocktails."}
{"text":"Interior is nice mix of urban hip and country chic. Burgers were expensive but worth the price. Drink menu was extensive, service was friendly and attentive.  One person in party had dry burger but overall we were impressed by our first visit here."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful restaurant with something for everyone.  Our group of four shared a cheese board and sourdough bread with gravy for an appetizer.  It was all good but the gravy was to die for! Salads were fresh and seasoned to perfection.  Our table enjoyed the beef duo (2 of us) which was terrific and just the right size.  You could even split it if you were having more appetizers or small plates.  One person had the scallops which were cooked perfectly!  The burger and fries were just as impressive as the other dishes - burger was big and juicy and the fries were fresh cut and crispy.  We topped it off with the deconstructed s'more which was heavenly!  Our server Stephanie couldn't have orchestrated a more perfectly paced meal and her positive, \"can do\" personality made the whole meal that much better!  We'll definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Came here again.  It was still packed, but was a more pleasurable.  Did a Prix Fixe menu with my friends and we each got a different dish and shared.  It was a great meal from start to finish."}
{"text":"Our server Sam was friendly and attentive. She was wonderful! The El Presidente cocktail is the bomb! Appetizers were fantastic. Sunday Gravy is delicious! A perfect late evening snack while drinking."}
{"text":"Words cannot describe how awesome this restaurant is. From a culinary standpoint, this place is killing it. Everything is perfectly cooked and well balanced. The service and ambiance is impeccable. I haven't had a restaurant truly surprise and impress me in a long time. I am blown away by the level of flavor profiles, creativity, and originality of this establishment. I can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Overall a great experience. I had a couple of small plates rather than a full meal. The cauliflower and the shishito peppers were fantastic! My husband had the hanger steak and said it was pretty good. The atmosphere is fun and funky. Service is so-so."}
{"text":"We haven't even left the building and feel the need to scream from the rooftops how stupid amazing this place is. As industry employees, my person and I generally despise Yelp but James made our experience one of the most enjoyable nights out we have ever had together. We came to town for stupid touristy stuff and were sucked in by the wall of bourbon, which is as beautiful of a sight as it sounds. I started with a Salinger's Sling and my person got the Applejack Sazerac. His was a little boozy for my taste but he loved it, while mine was perfect for me. For the next round we rolled the dice and got some dealers choice cocktails, Basil Hayden for me, Bookers for my person. And again, they were perfect for both of us. Apps were the pan dripping sourdough and Mac and cheese. And it was STUPID how fast we ate these damn things. Mac and cheese had the perfect amount of crunch. It was just dumb how good they were. Entrees were the flank steak medium rare for me, and pappardelle for my person. We ended up being so full and still wanting dessert we split the remainder of our entrees in half so we could each take some of both. We are at this very moment sharing both of them and I personally want to cry tears of joy. James is fantastic, his recommendations will not disappoint. I would make the drive from Cleveland just for this ridiculous ice cream sandwich I'm shoving in my mouth right now. Bravo!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  The variety of American whiskey is unbelievable.  That's the number one reason why I like to go here.  Sure, you can potentially pay $80 for an ounce of Pappy 20 year, but that's going to happen everywhere.  But Butcher & the Rye has so much variety that you can get very good 1 ounce or 2 ounce pours for cheaper than most bars in town.  Maggie is my bartender every time i'm there and she is fantastic.  She knows a ton about whiskey and can make great cocktails. I think she lives there, but I'm not complaining! I highly recommend this place, especially if you want to impress a visiting family member or friend from out of town."}
{"text":"The worst service I have had in Pittsburgh. Never offered drink refill. Over one hour for a burger. Get hip to match your decor with service. Even the manager was late. An embarrassment for the people from out of town."}
{"text":"Food was outrageous:  stand outs were the daily special of pig face and beef heart ragu, the charcuterie, and the sunday gravy.  However our waitress was sort of short, nasty, and seemed annoyed by us.  For me, the food is super important, but the people presenting that food and making the experience matters quite a bit, as well.  If you don't absolutely love food or talking about it, don't get into the business.  Especially at a restaurant of this caliber.  Sorry."}
{"text":"Lovely decor. The food was wonderful, especially the brussel sprouts."}
{"text":"Top 5 best restaurants in the city. Everything is amazing. If they have the appetizer \"Pan Dripping\" you have to get it!!!! Decor/ambiance is unique and well thought out. Making reservations is a must - and if you can- request the 3rd floor. It is more intimate and you get a birds eye view."}
{"text":"We had an absolutely delicious meal. I had the beef you he ravioli and it was like a flavor explosion! The cocktails were also amazing, a few of us had the autumnal punch. And we ended the meal with the pot de creme which was pistachio and a caramel apple pie - both incredible! Also, great service, very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"This is the best dining experience I have had in Pittsburgh in years. We.got great drink recommendations and food recommendations from the staff.   The atmosphere is cool in the best way. Service was perfect ....attentive without being intrusive."}
{"text":"Food was a 5. Atmosphere was a 4. Table for two too small for tapas + cocktails. Seating very close. That said, everything we ate was excellent. Rice cakes were more like rice gnocchi in a terrific plum sauce. Flank steak perfectly cooked. Country ham was more like prosciutto with little biscuits and jam. Fried Brussels (special) done perfectly. Excellent choice for downtown pre-theater dining."}
{"text":"In town from Chicago for the Stillers SNF game.  Didn't have a reservation, but got seats at the upstairs bar.  Everything was delicious - the brussel sprouts, the mussels, the dirty pasta, the pot de crème; and the cocktails were perfect.  Jay is the best bartender in PIT.  Can't wait to dine here again."}
{"text":"Awesome, awesome, awesome place; can't wait to go back once in town for business. Friendly staff, amazing food, great drinks, and cool atmosphere!!"}
{"text":"Their roast chicken is the most delicious chicken I've ever had. The way they cook it is peerless. The bar staff is charming, knowledgeable, and friendly. Awesome spot."}
{"text":"LOVE, love, love this place. After several attempts to walk in failed, we just went to the bar. Not disappointed. The decor is a dream. The service impeccable. And from a pescatarian's view....trust me, you aren't forgotten or shoved to the side as an afterthought. We had the artisanal cheese tray, the Brussels (my all time fave!!), the cauliflower (divine!) and the scallops risotto. Amazing food!  The agave drink was heavenly. Cannot wait to return!!"}
{"text":"Dinner was superb. Pork meatball app was great as were the shashito peppers. Cassoulet entre was awesome as well as the dirty pasta dish. Service was both friendly and attentive. One of the best Pittsburgh has to offer."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Menu was unique and the dishes were excellent."}
{"text":"Been wanting to come here for quite awhile, but have always waited too long to make reservations. Finally made it for dinner last night and it (mostly) lived up to very high expectations.    Sat upstairs at a two-top with very low, but quite comfortable leather chairs.  Started with two gin-based cocktails -- the Bramble and Bee's Knees -- that were both outstanding.  Fewer gin cocktails on this brown liquor-focused menu, but they were both perfectly balanced.  For food, started with the artisan cheeseboard, which was just right to whet the palate, and particularly enjoyed the blue cheese and cute little square of honeycomb.  Shared 5 small plates after that--the crispy octopus (a special), the brussels sprouts, the bone marrow, the pig candy, and the mac and cheese. The crispy octopus was delicious, with fried panisse, chick peaks, and a lemon emulsion. Only minor disappointment was that there was only one small tentacle. At the $18 (I think) price point, might expect more (especially since the sister restaurant TAKO next door is so much more generous with the octopus on their tacos).  Brussels were great, with generous parmigiano reggiano and lemon aioli, and not as sweet as other versions around.  The pig candy (pork belly) was delicious, if just a little tough, and I wished the kimchi had a little more bite.  Bone marrow also rich and tasty, although I wanted an actual parsley salad (really just a few chopped leaves and red onion scattered on top) and definitely more grilled bread. Oddly, there was just one slice of grilled bread, so we ordered more to soak up every luscious drop of the marrow.  Finally, the mac and cheese was perfect--brown and crispy on top, rich and creamy beneath.  Service was friendly and mostly attentive, and ambiance was laid-back but classy.  Thumbs up all around."}
{"text":"This is unique place to Pittsburgh. The drinks and food are pricey, but well worth it. Great for a celebration, intimate gathering, or pre/post show meet up spot. The place can get crowded if you go during peak hours."}
{"text":"This is easily one of the BEST meals I've ever had in Pittsburgh.  Seated upstairs, where it can be a bit cramped, but the atmosphere & decor is really fun, the music was great, and it's nice and cozy for a date.  HAVE THE BRUSSELS SPROUTS.  PERIOD.  These are probably the best Brussels sprouts that I've ever had, and I've had a lot of good Brussels sprouts!  The pork belly just melts in your mouth, and the charcuterie was excellent.  Our waiter, Josh, was super attentive, and when I was ready for a whiskey, and asked for a nice smooth scotch, Josh recommended a 12-year single malt from Auchentoshan Distillery, and it was spot-on.  It's pricey because you're going to want to have a cocktail or whiskey, but it's absolutely worth every penny.  Just go to Butcher and the Rye, and find out for yourself - you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"We were in town for Valentine's Day weekend, and on the recommendation of some friends, we stopped in for a bite to eat and a drink. Being that it was V-day weekend, we were lucky to grab a spot along the wall at a countertop. All I can say is....WOW! I ordered the Pig Candy, which lasted about one minute on my plate. That piggy had no chance! We split an order of the Mac n' Cheese, which was also delicious. He ordered their soup special as well, which he said was just as yummy.   We decided to treat ourselves and order some dessert. We opted for the Salted Caramel Apple. When our waitress came back to check on us a minute after getting the dessert, she began to ask \"How is it?\" and immediately knew our answer... the empty plate said it all! The couple next to us laughed because apparently the same thing happened with them, only they had ordered the S'mores.   Next time we're in Pittsburgh, we'll definitely be making reservations to enjoy a full dining experience and a tasting of their drinks!"}
{"text":"Really nice atmosphere. The lamb neck appetiser is to die for!! Wide drink selection!"}
{"text":"Service is poor. Asked for breaker twice only to get four burnt slices without butter, lol. Steak is the size of a finger. My friend ordered it and then we had to go to Chipotle afterward to end our hunger. He got a huge steak bowl with chips and guacamole there. The salads at butcher were loaded with dressing, far too much. Won't ever come back. Better off going to Tako or South Side or Oakland area to eat well."}
{"text":"Lived in Pittsburgh for over three years. Butcher and the Rye is still one of the best meals I had since moving here. We went the route of splitting 4 small plates and a couple of desserts. Everything, especially the country ham and biscuits and shishito peppers was excellent"}
{"text":"Nice place.l with a different atmosphere and interesting drink menus. Food is good, hand made and offers interesting variations."}
{"text":"Wow this place was so delicious!!! I have tried numerous restaurants all over the east coast and this gastro pub was one of the best. Our party had the following: Scallops with crab risotto-very rich and well executed. Buttery and flavorful! Wagyu beef-wow this was amazing! The blue cheese was great with the dish, the steak cooked medium was perfect.  Short ribs-didn't try this dish but our friend said it was really good. Lemon cake dessert-I was just expecting a piece of regular lemon cake but instead got a slice of delicious airy and light lemon sponge cake with matcha green tea ice cream and meringue. It was so good!  All the drinks were stellar as well. We had the Moscow mule with jalapeños, the Irishman and some drink with bourbon and grand mariner, all were spot on in flavor and execution.  The only complaint I have is the women's bathroom, so weird with the two low stalls side by side, totally weird! Besides that this place is yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Great tasting drinks, but way too much ice!  Octopus was tender, and steak tartare is sublime.  Fried apple pie was mouthwatering.  Over all great dining experience."}
{"text":"After having this restaurant on my to-visit list for a long time, my girlfriend and I finally went here to eat several Saturdays ago for dinner.  On first impression, the restaurant has an extremely interesting interior, from the bar that spans 2 stories, to the bookshelves behind my girlfriend filled with old encyclopedias, a skeleton stored in a glass container and a taxidermy bear.  Unfortunately neither of us got mixed drinks from that massive display of liquor because we were both dehydrated from a day on the point, but both of the tables next to us were remarking about how much they were enjoying theirs.  To start, we got the pig candy.  I've never had a piece of pork prepared like this before and it was quite interesting to eat such a tasty piece of pork that melted in your mouth like this.  For entrees, I got the seared halibut with gnocchi and my girlfriend got seared scallops.  The halibut in my dish was definitely the best halibut I've ever had and the dish overall was quite interesting given the eclectic mix of vegetables, sauces, and even raisins present.  Every bite was like a new adventure into the unknown.  My girlfriend's scallops were prepared excellently as well, and we both thoroughly enjoyed our dishes.  The service was prompt and friendly as well.  The price was on the steep side especially considering we didn't get the rather expensive mixed drinks, but we enjoyed ourselves and will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Hit the jackpot!  This is a quaint and cozy place with good food and phenomenal selection of scotch, ryes and whiskies.  The bar tenders are extremely knowledgeable and if you enjoy chatting with knowledgeable people and learning, this is the best place to go in Pittsburgh.  Highly recommend it.  Btw, the best food on their menu is their scallops - remarkable."}
{"text":"Best meal I have had in years.   I got a rare steak like any rational person would do and it was cooked to perfection. My friend and I split a pork belly appetizer and it tasted like the best bacon you have ever had. For dessert we split the deep fried brownie and I normally hate desserts but this was the most decadent dessert I have ever had.   Service was amazing as well. We just showed up without a reservation not realizing it was as popular as it is with long waits but the bar is open and we were served quickly. Bartenders at the 2nd floor bar were nice as can be.   Great time. Will be back."}
{"text":"Group dinner, and we liked it.  Shared a bunch of dishes... shishito peppers... short ribs... mac n' cheese... rabbit pappardelle... Wagyu flank steak... Brussels sprouts.  Honestly, the food was four stars overall (some dishes better than others), but the place has a fun vibe. Very trendy too, if you're into that."}
{"text":"Service was friendly and attentive with the exception of the hosts which seemed more interested in themselves and their iced coffees than the fact that we were there to eat which kind of left a bad first impression when we checked in for our reservations. Luckily the rest was positive enough to more than make up for it. Started with the country ham and shishito which were both delicious in their own ways. Our meals , the chicken and wagyu dishes, were 5/5 as well as our drinks evident by the fact that I couldn't even spare the 10 seconds to take a picture before digging in."}
{"text":"The restaurant is a wonderful blend of New York City trendy with Midwest values and roots. Every plate was wonderful. Our favorite plate may have been the pan drippings with home made sourdough bread. There are seating areas on three levels. Some tables are close together, but looking at the dishes other people order is part of the fun of eating there. I'm looking forward to my next meal there."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. The atmosphere, food, and drinks are like nothing else. Be sure to order the Mac and cheese!"}
{"text":"A solid version of a new American restaurant, with great cocktails and a deep whiskey list. Food was also excellent, though the portions a little small for the price (even some of the large plates...looking at you, scallops). Brussels sprouts, bone marrow, and roasted cauliflower were all standouts."}
{"text":"If you want unique cuisine that is close to the theaters - this is your place.  You have a choice of sitting in an intimate setting upstairs or in a group setting downstairs.  They do an incredible job with pork bellies that just melted in your mouth.  Our group varied from seafood, hamburger, and steak - we all shared bites and not one complaint - all tasty.  Additionally their whisky paring added to the tasting fun."}
{"text":"I was glad to finally make it here to try it out.  There's been a lot of talk about it and I wanted to see it for myself.  First, the atmosphere, vibe, ambiance, and food is unique here.  You're not likely to find another place in Pittsburgh that is similar.  We ate on the second floor which overlooks the first floor bar.  There are books along one wall like an old world library, unique lighting fixtures, and stuffed animals on the walls.  The tables have things like a pig dressed in a suit, and so on.  Very cool place.  We had three appetizers: the pig candy (sweetened pork belly), the 4-blend mac and cheese, and the bone marrow.  Everything was very delicious, although the pork belly texture was throwing me off a bit.  The mac and cheese was plentiful, creamy, and delicious.  The bone marrow, but especially the accompaniment of oxtail jam(to die for!), was a real hit!  We also had the scallops, which consisted of three perfectly cooked scallops.  The scallops had a great hard sear on them, and 90% of the restaurants in Pittsburgh miss the cook on them --- often undercooking them, or not having the pan hot enough.  The scallops were SUPPOSED to be served with a crab risotto, but I wouldn't really know, because instead of actually getting risotto, I got what looked like a plate with a little sauce on it, and no risotto to speak of.  The \"Around the World\" whiskey flight was a Bourbon, an Irish Whiskey, and a Japanese Whiskey.  All delicious, but the pours (3/4 oz) were really small.   The service was friendly enough, and efficient but lacked the polish of a better restaurant.  Dishes were left on the table longer than necessary.  For instance, when we walked through the restaurant to our table, a group of waiters were talking by the stairs, and one girl was actually blocking the stairs.  We needed to maneuver around her as she continued to BS with her co-workers.  I didn't want to disrupt her story.  The portion sizes (of even the so-called Large Plates) were on the small side.  I was glad we ordered plenty of appetizers.  The almost complete omission of risotto on BOTH plates of scallops(perhaps not an accident?), and lack of better service gives this place four stars.  As I've mentioned in other reviews, when a restaurant is parting me with $200+ for a dinner of two(ok, including a few drinks!), the value has to be there.  If you want top dollar, your food has to be \"top\" and your service has to be \"top.\"  Overall, I'd recommend it with the noted caveats."}
{"text":"Excellent!  We arrived at around 10pm for some late night food. We had five different types of cocktails. All were really good and well-priced.  We also ordered the brussel, cauliflower, duck liver and the pork candy. The brussel was a bit salty for me, especially the outer layers. Once I removed those the taste was wonderful. Cauliflower was so-so, though we don't like the sauce on the plate. The duck liver and the pork candy were fantastic! Both were very flavourful and the tastes were not too strong. Would definitely recommend.   We did not try their large plates today and their criapy octopus ran out today. Would love to be back to try more of their food next time! Definitely a good 5 star restaurant. One of the really great ones in the Pittsburgh area."}
{"text":"This place does not disappoint, the scallops and risotto are perfectly cooked with great flavor. You also can't go wrong with the strip steak, if your in the mood for a steak. If your in the mood for a burger, it's if not the best, one of the best in the city. The service as always was great."}
{"text":"We had reservations for our anniversary and wee greeted kindly at the door. We were seated promptly and our server was very nice! She was aware that it was our anniversary and brought us over two complimentary glasses of champagne which was a nice touch! Overall, our meal was delicious. We tried a few small plates and salads and our entrees (filet and scallops) were cooked to perfection. The dessert of carrot cake wasn't the best dessert I've ever had but all in all, I don't have anything negative to add about Butcher! We will be back."}
{"text":"When I think of a restaurant that embodies the culture of Pittsburgh while feeling very city-like, Butcher & the Rye comes to mind. Why? Because their menu hits all the great flavors that make Western Pennsylvania what it is: great cuts of meat and fish, seasonal veggies cooked with plenty of earthy flavors, and a drink selection that screams \"whiskey-lover\". Stop by mid-evening for a quiet after work crowd, or come on in after 9pm for a lively bar scene.  Speaking of the bar... I used to only come to Butcher for the drinks. Their specials hang on a piece of brown butcher paper along the wall and the bar itself is small and intimate. It's most distinguished feature is their full wall of whiskey at this place that they have a neat sliding ladder that the bartenders will climb up to reach bottles up high. The bartenders themselves are extremely knowledgeable. They can make you anything you want! I love their Mint Juleps at Butcher, as well as their Old Fashioned.  Now, let's talk about the food. When I finally did make my way over to the second floor for a meal, my date and I split three dishes. It was the perfect amount of food and everything was cooked to perfection with a beautiful balance of weight, flavor, and texture. My favorite was their sprouts, but the mac and cheese came close behind, as well as their roasted cauliflower. The service was fantastic, and the waiters have these great little leather bound books that they leave the check in. You can flip through this book and see what messages and drawings past guests have left Then, you can leave your mark on Butcher and the Rye as well. The Ambiance in this restaurant is dark, intimate, and rustic. It's something out of the prohibition age, with a rusty-victorian flair. I love all the cool lamps hanging on the walls and the polished wooden tables. If the weather is nice, it's awesome to sit outside and people watch on Sixth Street. Indoors, is a great experience on its own, though!  Butcher and the Rye nailed food in Pittsburgh on the head. It's a classic go-to destination for those visiting and locals alike. Enjoy!  - xoxo, A (A California girl living in Pittsburgh on purpose)"}
{"text":"It is just amazing. Been to so many good restaurant. This place is just insanely good! The best!"}
{"text":"Great food, great cocktails and great service.  We were visiting from out of town for conference and based on the existing reviews on Yelp thought we needed try it.   So glad we did!  Will go straight there the next time I'm in town for sure."}
{"text":"CAME FOR THE RYE ...TURNED OFF BY THE FAUX DÉCOR!  Hello my loves! I survived my divorce only to have my career explode and become a MAJOR success. I've returned -somewhat-to my fun exciting \"Sex in the City\" life!  Sooooo...back to my sharp criticism ;-)  Finally got a table at this joint and went with the crew because I'm loving the whiskey bar trend. First impressions: LOUD AS FUCK (yes I'm becoming an old marm). I would also call this crowd the \"I think I'm trendy but I'm really 40 and shop at TJ Maxx\" HA! Did I just type that?! YES I DID **OWNS IT**  As you may know I am neither 40 nor do I shop at TJ Maxx...!   Bar was beautiful and all the bartenders had beards = did you get off the bus before the Lawrenceville stop???  I sat down and dissected the menu. I was not impressed by the short list but the whiskey selections were OK. The food menu looked great from the get go so...as lame as I am I ended up boozing on Prosecco!   Food was great...we did small plates. Beef tartar was spot on, very flavorful, appropriately chilled with a delicious aioli. Mac and Cheese was not worth it. Smoke Tacos has better Mac. Pig Candy was tasty pork belly nicely crisped but not hugely inventive. Brussel sprouts were tasty good balance of acid and oil, I enjoyed it. What stole the show for me was something VERY simple! Fresh sourdough bread with pan drippings! That was excellent! Like eating at a delicious kitchen table in the south of France! Kinda!  WHAT I HATED...the people! Such posers! And the décor was so phony. Faux distressed railing near my balcony table reminded me of the episode of Mary Tyler Moore \" Support Your Local Mother\" when she is trying to \"antique\" a table hitting it with a chain and she just can't stop laughing...seriously message me if you get that reference cause you probably rock and am a person I should know!  **** Nearly forgot - I got charged $24 a pop for the last of Wigle's deep cut rye = sticker shock! $48 for two drinks - foul ball fools!   This is bold but I'm just gonna say it - go to Tender in Lawrenceville!  Love you! Muah!"}
{"text":"Butcher is one of my favorite drink spots. No matter what I can always count on a good experience!"}
{"text":"The Butcher and the Rye was one of the highlights of my trip to Pittsburg. The ambiance of the restaurant and is extremely unique and very interesting. Immediately upon interning you are feel relaxed and calmed from the outside bustle of one of Pittsburg's busiest areas. The whiskey selection is one of the best I've ever seen in the United States. It is refreshing to see a bar take so much pride in using fresh and unique additions to craft each drink. I would say if you ever were wondering what the difference between a cocktail and a drink or a mixologist and a barter come here and experience the difference.   The Rabbit Stew and the Filet were both great. Both dishes were extremely tasteful and succulent. It is important to note that the portion size is on the bit of the smaller side so definitely consider getting a couple appetizers before the meal.   Our waiter and staff were very knowledgeable and polite would increased the experience as well.   If you are visiting Pittsburg and looking for a nice bite to eat with some good cocktails look no further"}
{"text":"We sat in the front in the room to the right with the large American flag on the wall. It is a super room off to the side and perfect for larger parties. If you are a party of 6 or more I recommend you try and get this table. The weather was lovely and the doors were open onto the street, and the ambience was fantastic. This place is a whiskey lovers dream, they have a huge wall of whiskey, with (I think) over 500 on the menu. I'm not into whiskey myself, however I had a whiskey cocktail the rye Buck with lime and ginger that was probably one of the better cocktails I've ever had.  The wait staff are excellent, they are fun, friendly, hip and make your experience a great one. The restaurants design is seriously cool, we loved it! It is incredibly interesting, for no other reason, if you do to want to eat (which you should as the food is outstanding) go for a drink or 3.  Food was wonderful, we split some appetizers and then all ordered a main meal. Everyone loved their meal, and we were an eclectic bunch. I had the scallops, and loved loved loved the blue crab risotto that it is served with, they were seriously good. Word to the women, the female bathroom is \"interesting\" check it out. I will not ruin it for you, but it's a talking point. Basically you cannot go wrong here, it was probably one of our favorite restaurants that we tried while in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Last week on Thursday night. Horrible the duck soup had a funny taste. Tha dirty pasta was so salty i could feel my vision getting bad. Eat three pastas and still paid full price. Should of went to the taco joint next door. So disappointed."}
{"text":"The scallions are to die for. As are the manhattans. Definitely pricey (easy to drop over $100 on dinner and a few drinks for one), but the atmosphere, service and quality make every cent worth it. They literally have a gorgeous wall of ryes. I would recommend if you're downtown.  I would highly recommend making a reservation. Anytime that I haven't, I haven't been able to get a table - and barely able to snag bar seats."}
{"text":"I heard excellent reviews for this place so I did have high expectations. First of all the atmosphere is terrific. There is a lot of energy and the service was good as well. The menu had a lot of variety. I was impressed.  Terrific cocktail menu as well.    Unfortunately,  The small plates that we ordered did not impress. The brussels sprouts were soaked in oil and served with mayonnaise. Way too heavy!  The mussels were tasty but they were too many flavors going on  at the same time. The pig wing was good but quite small . The octopus special was nothing special.   It was served with a chickpea relish and a fried chickpea  fritter that was pretty good but again did not showcase the octopus very much.    After splitting four small plates, I was so full that I could not try anything else. I would however consider going back in trying some other things on the menu. If you like extremely heavy food you may like it better than I did."}
{"text":"I can finally say I understand the hype that this place gets. Don't get me wrong, it's not that I haven't been here before--I have. It's just that both times when I was here before, I didn't get the appeal. We had mediocre service and my dish was undercooked. I was hesitant to feel completely negative about them; after all, they were new and I have never had an unenjoyable experience at their sister restaurant, Meat and Potatoes.   Giving them the benefit of the doubt and assuming that perhaps they were working out the kinks (after all, they had just recently opened), we returned to tonight and I am so happy that we did.  We arrived slightly earlier than our reservation, so we had some time to sit at the bar. The bartender was friendly and helped my fiance pick out a whiskey from their enormous selection. Given the limited information my fiance gave him, the bartender was spot on and recommended a whiskey that he really enjoyed (Black Maple Hill). I ordered a Brandy En-Rouge and, spoiler alert, that's what I drank for the rest of the night, despite their extensive cocktail list, because if it ain't broke, why fix it, yaknowwhatimean?   We were seated soon thereafter and greeted by our really wonderful server, Stephani. She promptly refilled our water and replenished our cocktails. Bobby tried a whiskey flight, which he thoroughly enjoyed. For a starter, we split the Sunday Gravy and it was amazing. My taste buds were seriously having a dance party right there in my mouth. Soon after we were finished, a friendly guy came by to bus our dishes, and immediately had our silverware replenished and our waters topped off. Our water glasses never made it to empty the entire night.  On to the main course, my fiance had the skirt steak which looked amazing, and it was definitely cooked perfectly. I enjoyed the Dirty Pasta. And by enjoyed I mean it was definitely one of the best things I've ever eaten. The sauce was amazing and the pasta was cooked perfectly.   For dessert we split the du jour pot de creme (espresso with raspberry topping). I kid you not, I could have eaten like 7 of these. It was delicious.   Despite the fact that the restaurant was crowded and loud, our seats felt intimate and we could hear each other talk the entire time. The restaurant was a little warm, but the food was totally unparalleled and the service was obsequious without being domineering. The atmosphere was trendy and cool, and the armchairs we sat in were so comfortable. I'm happy to see this place has finally found its groove."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to start; this place was a fantastic ending to a short visit to Pittsburgh.  The details from the time you walk inside including beautiful velvet wallpaper to multi-tiered liquor storage at the bar, are incredible and have you looking in every direction possible while waiting for your meal.  We sat in the third floor lounge, at a low table with sofa seating that was perfect for my husband and I to enjoy a light dinner and dessert.  I ordered the macaroni and cheese, which was full of flavor and topped with crunchy panko for a great balance.  My husband ordered the crispy pig wings which he absolutely loved and said the portion was just right to satisfy his hunger but not overstuff him.  But the dessert...the dessert was incredible!  We ordered the deconstructed s'mores with brown butter fried ice cream and it was every bit as amazing as that sounds.  To top everything off, our server was fantastic.  I would recommend a visit to anyone considering dinner in the 'burgh and definitely get some dessert afterwards!"}
{"text":"Place look like it had a cool menu. Stopped in for a drink and the bartender was such and arrogant pain that the single overpriced drink that our group had was ruined. There were not many people there and the bartender was far more concerned with chatting with the ladies there and when asked about menus and drinks was really \"put out\". I think this place has a lot of potential to be good, it was just a terrible experience and we chose to take our business elsewhere."}
{"text":"I'm torn when it comes to Butcher and the Rye.  The food and drinks were fantastic.  The service was decidedly not.    I walked in just shortly after they opened (literally minutes after the door was opened) on a Wednesday or Thursday night.  I was in town for business and was starving.  I walked to the host stand and said \"Hi, just one\" and the host looked at me like I had three heads.  He finally, after looking around the restaurant as if for backup, said \"only the bar is available, if that's not ok for you...well...\" then looked to the woman standing next to him.  Unsure if he was done with me or not but pretty hungry I walked over to the bar and sat down.    I tried one of the signature cocktails, the Black Dhalia, which was very good.  Sort of a toxic detox cocktail with rye, activated charcoal, lemon, tea, and egg whites.  As I already said, I was starving, so I started with the sourdough bread which came with some delicious gravy for dipping.  I decided to go with one of the evenings specials; the beef heart bolognese and I was very happy I did.  I was wonderful.  Especially paired with a fantastic red wine by the glass. I love the décor and atmosphere.  It's very dark, warm, and cozy.  Think woodsy chic.    So the food pretty much made up for the not so warm welcome at the door.  But listening to the bartender tell other patrons \"If someone comes in and orders an old fashioned with Bulleit I just tell them \"No.  Pick something else\"\" made me twitchy.  I realize they have tons of rye and whiskey to pick from and would like to broaden the palate of their customers when they can.  But if I order a drink and the bartender says \"No.\" because they want me to try something else I'm not going to be there very long.  And, having to flag down the bartender (at a very small bar) to get their attention got old really fast.       The food was fantastic but the service almost negated it.  I'd probably go back but not before I try any number of other restaurants in the area.  For the food and decor/atmosphere I'd say 5 stars.  For the service I'd probably go with 2.   One more thing...what's with the bolt under the bar?  Is it supposed to be there?  Like to hang a purse or coat on?  Or is it just shoddy workmanship and a lawsuit waiting to happen?  I scraped my knee on it twice.  If it's just a bolt sticking out from under the bar: Get rid of it, it's sharp and dangerous.  If it's a coat/purse hook: a bolt is a stupid choice and get rid of it, it's sharp and dangerous."}
{"text":"One of the things I enjoyed the most was the atmosphere and the decor of the restaurant. I went on a weekend night so the wait was long for a seated table, but we were able to wait and snag a seat at the bar - which is probably my favorite part. The whiskey bookcase is the focal point of the restaurant and for good reason. Drink were great and so was the service of the bartender.   We ordered the bone marrow, pate, and the dirty pasta. All of which were very good. The fresh pasta was well mad and cooked. The ground duck was delicious even on it's own.   After only having been here once, I would definitely come back for a second go."}
{"text":"Food and service  was good! The marrow and dirty pasta were excellent! We got the lamb neck and it tasted like any other piece of roasted meat. It was cooked properly but needed something to make it stand out."}
{"text":"After a less-than-stellar experience at Meat & Potatoes, I was hesitant when friends suggested Butcher and the Rye before our show at Heinz Hall. So glad I went anyway! Apparently it's hard to get reservations, but our friends were able to make some and we sat at a cool open-air table.   The foccacia bread was so-so, but totally made up for by the wagyu burger that was on the list of specials. Served piping hot, it was the perfect done-ness, and the cheese (supposedly made in house also) was the icing on the...burger. The fries were delicious, too.   Since I usually avoid menu items like dirty pasta with ground duck meat (another of their offerings, which I'm told is amazing), I was glad to be able to get something that was so, well, normal, in such a trendy place.   Only slightly negative comment is that the service was a bit slow, even though we mentioned we were trying to catch a show after. Our reservations were an hour and 45 minutes before our show started across the street, and we just made it as the lights were dimming!"}
{"text":"I had high expectations for Butcher and the Rye especially as B&R is one of the most hyped restaurants in Pittsburgh. If this restaurant was only a bar it would receive 5 stars, absolutely on par with Bar Marco or other excellent cocktail bars in other cities. We sat at the bar and found the bartenders to be extremely knowledgeable about their extensive whiskey list. However, it is not only a bar. The food we had was overly salty and to be honest the portions were also too large."}
{"text":"After spending the day in the Strip District we headed downtown to find another really great place. Really cool atmosphere. Great bar and so much to choose from. Had a drink at bar then seated in dining room which was very comfortable. All of our choices were great! Kids ordered Mac n cheese and Shepard Pie. They loved it. We ordered the Scallops and roasted cauliflower w faro. Amazing!!!  You must visit the ladies room. But don't stress just lock the door behind you.   Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Both the food and ambiance are great.  I'm a huge foodie and always look for different items on a menu aside from the usual \"hot fried chicken\" or \"BBQ sliders.\" My only complaint is that we sat at the bar (we love sitting at the bar and eating) and the bartender was so awkward and rude.  Which I believe is strange since if you're going to be a great bartender, you probably are quite personable.  His drinks looked great, but he had 0 opinion about which is the best dish to order.  He gave me a strange stare when I asked to pack the rest of my meal in a to go box, and was just flat out rude at times."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh.  The food is amazing, the service is always great, and I love the decor.  The bread with the pan gravy is a must and I love their brussel sprouts.  I should explore their menu more but I love their \"dirty pasta\" so much I always just order that.  The ground duck sausage in the dish is just amazing.  Also I'm a big whiskey drinker and their selection of scotches and bourbons is pretty impressive.  Overall I love this place and always make an effort to bring out of town guests here."}
{"text":"Just returned from my business trip, needed to write this review. Great service, food, and atmosphere. Will definitely be returning! Until next time..... don't forget to tip your waiters."}
{"text":"Pretty good food but haven't been overly impressed with the times I've been here. Also, not a good option if you are pregnant. It's fine but I thought it'd be better. Had the burger which was good. I will say they were great for our anniversary with free champagne and a congratulations which I appreciated."}
{"text":"I went here last night for a friend's bachelorette party. We were a party of 10 so it was a pretty large group. I was excited to go to the Butcher and the Rye because I walk past it everyday when I go to work, but have never gone.. Until now. We had a great waiter and he suggested drinks for us based on the kinds of flavors we liked. I went with the Lions Tail. I believe it had bourban, lime, and a couple other ingredients all served over ice. It was so good... And so smooth. The perfect drink to warm you up when it's 5 degrees outside (as it was yesterday!) As far as food, I got the Caesar salad and Shishito. My salad was so good! A plate of baby kale with tomatoes, cheese and a Caesar dressing. Underneath the salad was a piece of bread just soaking up all of the flavors. It was delicious!!  Now onto my other small plate, Shishito. I have to be honest and tell you that I had to google what Shishito was before I ordered it. I read that they are small, sweet peppers so I decided to go with it. Oh my goodness were they delicious! They were grilled and seasoned with miso salt. They had came with radish slices, cilantro, and lime wedges. Around the end of the plate was a spicy sauce that sort of tasted like spicy mayo. I can't get over how good they were! My best friend got the Brussels small plate. I don't even like Brussel Sprouts but I tried them and oh my gosh!! Amazing! They came with a garlic aioli and it was so good too! I ended my meal with the smores dessert. Friend ice cream, bourbon marshmallows, chocolate graham crackers and dark chocolate bars. Need I say more? Delicious! Overall, I would definitely recommend this place. I can't wait to go back try other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"This is as good as it gets in Pittsburgh.  The food was fabulous and the drinks are wonderful.  The best bartenders in the city.    The Mac N Cheese is fantastic.  Get it you will love it!!!!    There is nothing on the menu that is not worth trying at least once.    Go to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Such a great dining experience! We're a group that likes to share everything...meals, drinks and stories. This was the perfect place to enjoy all three. With a group of 6, we were seated at the front, wooden table right by the opened wall looking out to Heinz Hall. While the table was huge for 6 (we had TONS of room) the restaurant wasn't too noisy that we couldn't all talk with each other. We all ordered cocktails (with one wine order) and everyone was thrilled with their choices. The Nauti-Mule was deliciously refreshing with a surprising bite to it...definitely don't drink it out of the straw or you'll get all jalapeño!  The meals themselves were out of this world. On the table were the Cassoulet, the specialty Burger, the Scallops, the Monk Fish and the Hanger Steak. Our waiter (whose name I didn't catch but he was wonderful!) recommended 4 of his favorite meals..and he definitely hit the nail on the head. The Cassoulet was my meal and while I was originally a bit overwhelmed when it was first placed on the table, the flavored came together so perfectly that it was so easy to eat. Another favorite of the bunch was the scallops with crab risotto. If you're a seafood lover, I recommend them!  We always go with the Brussel sprouts as a starter when we're here and they never disappoint.  All in all, a fantastic night out! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Fun eclectic but comfy atmosphere, great service, and delicious food. Everything we had was incredible with beautiful presentations. The strawberry pie was off the charts."}
{"text":"What can I say. This place delivered! We came in right after the baseball game ended right as they got slammed. They took our name for a table. We thought we had to wait forever but they called us As we were trying to pay for the first drink. The service was friendly and attentive. The food was amazing. I got the dirty pasta and my husband got the steak. Full of flavor and large portions! The pasta was cooked perfectly. My biggest pet peeve, living in Washington DC is spending $80 and bring underwhelmed with dinner and still hungry. Not the case here. Yes slightly pricey but worth every penny!!"}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place, but it just wasn't that good. We were seated upstairs. The waitress was great-very friendly. The bar service was too slow, taking over 25 minutes to get my first and only beer. I even walked up to the bar to try to get service, but no one acknowledged me so I sat back down. I would easily have had 3 or more beers if the bar service had been better. Lost revenue for sure. The wife's cocktail came in 10 minutes and was \"good\" but not worth the price.  Was looking forward to the very colorful cauliflower app, but it was just bland.  The Brussels sprouts app was good but too salty and over-seasoned. Flank steak was tough, but the sauce was tasty. Wife's octopus was very good.  We shared the S'mores dessert and it was pretty good. All in all, not terrible, but not great either. Was really hoping for so much more and was ready to pay for a great meal. This experience just didn't deliver for us.  Glad some others had better experiences than we did, but I would definitely side with the average or below reviews on this place."}
{"text":"Fabulous find!  I was in town on business and am so happy I chose this restaurant to entertain colleagues.  Awesome, cozy and unique decor and delicious food!!  The cauliflower, charcuterie board and scallops were amazing!!"}
{"text":"The burgers! The wine! What a great place. Also, if it's on the menu, try the edamame. They prepare it like I've never had edamame. It's a great appetizer before you get to the meat!"}
{"text":"Wrong restaurant and couldn't figure out how to delete it, so changed to 5 stars."}
{"text":"When I went here, I expected that it would be an extremely expensive meal that I would be having just for the privilege of saying that I'd eaten at Butcher and the Rye, which is one of Pittsburgh's eminent dining spots. While I can't lie and say that the offerings are affordable for a weekly visit, it wasn't as bad as I had expected. Maybe it had something to do with my dining alone on this particular experience.  I started myself out with the Spalla, which combined an amazing flavor of orange and almond with the shoulder. It was an amazing experience for my palate that only cost me ten dollars. That was money well spent. For my main course, I decided on the \"Dirty Pasta\", which is actually an amazing duck mixed with strozzapreti. It had a good bit of romano cheese shredded on top. It was delightful. To finish my meal, I decided to have the artisanal cheese board. I'm a lover of good cheeses and the selection was excellent. Some new ones that I had not experienced before that made everything well worth the price. Overall, I spent less than $50 for an amazing meal coupled with a delightful atmosphere. While this isn't (and could not be) a weekly treat for me, I will make it a point to return sometime soon."}
{"text":"One of the hipper eateries in the city, Butcher and the Rye's food was good, but in my opinion, nothing too memorable or out of this world.   I tried a lot of plates on the menu, and this was one of those instances where the appetizers were more enjoyable than the entrees.  That's not saying that the food was bad, but I was expecting a lot more.    I do have to mention that it's worth checking out for the unique interior / atmosphere alone.  I would describe it as cross between a hunting lodge and a 1920's speakeasy.  Definitely dug the vibe of this place.  The food was pretty good too. I would eat here again, but I don't think the hype and reservation wait  is worth it.  Drinks and appetizers at the bar would be more warranted."}
{"text":"As always the food was deliciious  and the service was excellent. We had entrees and small plates and all were cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"I love trying any new Pittsburgh restaurant and this was on the top of my list.  We made a reservation about a month in advance knowing they can be hard to get. I recommend you definitely make reservations.  We were seated downstairs and I love the décor of the place-rustic with animal heads on the walls yet trendy. The bar is super cool and it was packed!  They have a nice drink menu and the prices are reasonable. I started off with the  Arsenal Santa Cinnamon-this is delicious but you get 7 oz for $8.  My next drink was the Penn Weizen which was only $4.  Our server was really knowledgably about the specials and menu items. We were served quickly and he checked in on us numerous times. I went with the cauliflower which was delicious and had a sweet/savory taste with carrots and a nice sauce.  I also got the country ham which was ok. I would not get this again. You get 2 small biscuits that don't have much taste with a few pieces of cured ham. The yogurt dipping sauce was good.  Others in my party ordered the mussels. I'm not a fan of seafood but you got a huge portion.  The rice cakes and Brussels sprout dishes were amazing and glad I got to sample them.  The mac and cheese looked delicious as well as the dirty pasty which was very tasty!  Wish we saved room for dessert.  The small plates are enough to eat on your own-probably recommend 2 per person or fun to share!"}
{"text":"Went here a few months ago for a business meeting and it was so delicious.  We ordered just about every appetizer on the menu and a chesse board.  For my entrée, I had the dirty pasta with duck SO TASTY!  The cocktails are some of the best I have ever had!  Cannot wait to stop back!  FYI- make a reservation far in advance- this places books up fast!"}
{"text":"Came here for pre-dinner cocktails and sat at the upstairs bar. Downstairs is a bit more light and airy while upstairs has dimmer lighting and interesting decor. Both cocktails we ordered were creative and well executed. Would definitely revisit this place if ever back in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner. This place is super for their ambiance, because... it's dark, sexy, moody, and a little macabre.  We typically order one or two dishes to split when we're in a new area. We split their signature dirty pasta and beet salad. Beet salad had a great presentation. Generous portions on the dirty pasta. Perhaps, I don't really know how to appreciate pasta - but I thought this was ok - saltier than I liked. Duck was good but just overall didn't leave a lasting impression.   I'd definitely recommend this place for a drink though."}
{"text":"Great drinks menu!  Excellent service, we ordered all small plates and our server arranged them in perfect tasting order!  We had all fantastic dishes some highlights were the pig wing, charcuterie plate, cheese plate, and tartar!! This is a place has a fun atmosphere and will give a great culinary experience!"}
{"text":"If whiskey's not your thing, be sure to check out the wonderfully curated wine list. My server recommended pairing the scallops with a perfectly crisp vermentino - definitely a must for any fellow winos."}
{"text":"This is as good as it gets.  I get to try good food living in Chicago, but this place would hold it's own anywhere.  They have a wall of whiskey that they use a rolling ladder to pluck the bottles with.  One guys job is to just ride the ladder.  Best food and best drinks in Pitt.  It's an eclectic new american menu with tons of cool dishes.  The mussels were great, try the Monk Fish with blue crab risotto."}
{"text":"Amazing! Last evening was our first visit and we were extremely impressed! While the seating can be a little bit tight it is still quite comfortable. The decor, rustic chic! I had the rabbit and truly enjoyed my meal. My wife had the trout and I was fortunate enough to get to taste it. We both agreed that it was phenomenal! The chocolate cake with just a hint of coffee was also over the top delicious. Our waiter, Ivan was extremely knowledgeable of the plates and made some excellent recommendations. If there is one area that could be improved upon it would be the drink pours. They were a little light. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Pigs candy is amazing. Sour of kimchi and sweet crunchy pig is great. Had the hanger steak it was great then I tasted my wife's dirt pasta that was delicious.  Finished it off w/ the s'mores."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a food baby, this is your place. I literally could not stop eating. I ordered the scallops which are laid over a bed of blue crab risotto. Blue. Crab. Risotto. The drinks are also amazing. If you're into whiskey, this is a good spot for you. If you're not, this is still a good spot for you. They have tons of drinks choices and bartenders make a delicious cocktail. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Great food, excellent whiskey, fantastic server: Samantha!"}
{"text":"Came to this restaurant Wednesday night. Group of 7. We sat outside which was nice. The food was excellent. We had different variety of appetizers to try and most of us had grilled filet, which also was really good. Now the server we had.. I wished I had got her name... she was so miserable and wasn't afraid to hide it. She looked like she didn't want anything to do with us. I even confronted her as to why she was so angry.. her excuse \"she worked all day\". Either yins are working you're employees to much or she just needs to find new career. As miserable as she was she shouldn't be working in public! Besides that miserable server, everything else was fine. I would come back but I would like to have a happier server."}
{"text":"I highly recommend the wagyu flank steak and the dirty duck pasta. The pasta itself is almost as good as the one from a great Italian restaurant. The pasta is well stretched and firm, not too soft. The steak is fantastic. Perfectly grilled and sauce is great too. We have snores for dessert. It is pretty good as usual but not as amazing as desserts in Joseph."}
{"text":"Super friendly service and amazing food! Even their small plates are incredibly rich so I wouldn't actually recommend getting that many dishes. It's best to share! This place is heaven for whiskey-lovers. We ended up doing a little blind whiskey tasting, and the bartender and waiter were excited to play along. It's a bit loud inside, sometimes making it a little difficult to enjoy food and private conversation."}
{"text":"We initially came here just for drinks but after watching several dishes go by and as the whiskey flowed, I just had to eat something.  In retrospect, I should have eaten more because the food and cocktails were delicious.  My wife and I sat at the very impressive bar which has dozens of whiskeys amongst an impressive host of other spirits.  You can tell from the jump that this is a cocktail bar.  Our bartender, Giuseppe was both a very able mixologist and a real treasure to chat with.  He expertly crafted drinks for the two of us while being a very good spokesperson for the city of Pittsburgh.  I'm sad that we only visited The Butcher and the Rye once and on the final evening of our trip.  I went off menu almost immediately just because I assumed (correctly thankfully) that this would be the kind of place that I could get an aged rum old fashioned.  Our barman smiled and ran upstairs to find one of their hidden bottles and made the drink perfectly.  My wife really enjoyed her moscow mule and while we stayed for a few more beverages, these two really stood out.  As for food, I got to have an order of the pig candy and the flavor of the dish changed as I ate it.  At first, I wasn't wowed because the sweet caramel seemed a bit much paired with the apple kimchi.  A bite or two later, the flavors really came together and then I found myself craving more.  Perhaps my mouth just had to be calibrated to appreciate this particular dish but I thought it was really well crafted and I'm happy I ordered it.  When (if) I'm in Pittsburgh next, this place will be a must visit."}
{"text":"Stopped by here on a Friday night and sat at the bar. The perks of eating alone is you never have to wait to be seated LOL.   The bartenders were kind and attentive even though it was pretty busy. I ordered a few appetizers and a drink:  -Shishito -Cauliflower -Brussels -Salinger's Sling  Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Easily the best restaurant I've been to in Pittsburgh. Be prepared to pay a lot, but it's worth it. Probably the best scallops I've ever had, and the Sunday gravy was a perfect appetizer"}
{"text":"We had the Brussel Sprouts and Scallops, which were delicious! However, my husband had the Lamb Neck, and he didn't enjoy it that much. It was very salty. The decor and location are great, but we made reservations weeks in advance and they placed us in a back corner table that was even hard for the waitress to get to. Overall, experience was good. I would go back to grab drinks at the bar, but the food was just ok."}
{"text":"We ordered the Brussels sprouts - very good. We also got the bone marrow - acceptable. I ordered the scallops - burnt. We told our waiter but he never came back with the manager. Our water glasses were empty for dinner. It was terrible service."}
{"text":"We celebrated a special occasion here. We were guided to a table for two on the top level; overlooking dining room below. Very nice; but very dark. We needed to use a flashlight app on our phone to read the menu.  Great service. Excellent food; especially the halibut and strawberry pie."}
{"text":"After hearing a lot of great things about Butcher and the Rye, my signifiant other and I decided to give it a shot. I was able to make reservations right through Yelp. We arrived right at our reservation time at 5:45PM and were seated immediately. Like many other reviews, the dirty pasta is to die for. My signifiant other ordered the hanger steak which he did not enjoy. I can attest to the hanger steak as we switched plates so he could enjoy the dirty pasta.   The overall experience was great! The service and food was excellent & very prompt. We made it out of dinner in a little over an hour, just in time for the rest of our evening plans. Butcher and the Rye is a great place for date nights"}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere! We had the brussel sprouts, bread, bone marrow, tartare, mac and cheese, and sunday gravy. Everything was excellent! I can't wait to return. I spend a significant amount of time in Chicago restaurants. The overall experience here was comparable to a trendy night out in the Windy city."}
{"text":"It started with an easily made reservation.  Upon our on time arrival, we were lead directly to our table.  Our courses were served with appropriate timing.  The food?  Excellent.  I enjoyed a Caesar salad (perfect amount of dressing and proportions), Pig Candy (decadently good) and Dirty Pasta (savory goodness).   Our guest proclaimed the Hanger Steak the best he had ever eaten.  My only quibble, and it is minor, our initial drink order was slow.  Beyond that service was fine.  We have dined at Butcher and Rye previously, all visits were top notch. Great restaurant."}
{"text":"I am not from Pittsburgh and when I was looking for a restaurant open near my hotel, I stumbled into this little gem of a restaurant. The dark, lofty, eclectic atmosphere was pleasant and welcome after a long day of tourism! I ordered a glass of Pino Noir and, while it was a very fine selection, it was $12.00 - a fact unknown to me until I got the check. However, it must've had a pretty high alc content because it did the job of two glasses of the crap I buy at home. We were seated upstairs in very close quarters to the tables on either side of us - don't expect privacy here. But my husband and I love people watching so we were not put off by being subjected to the DB sitting next to us trying to impress the girl we believe he met online. It was a form of entertainment. My husband spent a good 10 mins perusing the VERY extensive whiskey menu and decided on the Angel's Envy. What a treat! Truly a flavorful blend to savor slowly, first with the olfactory then orally. One can smell the unique ingredients. I plan to buy a bottle of this \"nectar of the gods\" for my boss at Christmas. It's definitely a bone warmer. We ordered a cheese tray appetizer. I was expecting a few triangles of Cheddar. What we got was a smattering of four specialty cheeses - each with opposing flavors - designed, I believe, to wake up your taste buds and remind them that there are still unique flavors in the world! My favorite thing about this tray was the sweet peach jelly infused with a touch of Mustard oil. There's a name for this lovely combination. But I forgot it. Our entree's were the Shephard's Pie and the Flank Steak. The Pie was wonderful. The meat was so tender it melts in your mouth. The flank steak was way way way too salty. I ate it all after those two $12 glasses of super charged Pinot Noir and chased it with 3 glasses of water. I don't think my Sober tongue would have done so well. Steve was a very patient, awesome, friendly server. We asked him more questions than any diner at 10pm on a Saturday night has a right to ask. We tipped him well. Overall, this is definitely a place foodies should try and meat & potato peeps like me should experience!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing. The place is decorated so cute. Services was good, drinks were great (got the punch), pork belly was to die for, Brussels sprouts were amazing, steak was great, scallops were great. Truly loved every part of that meal. The applie pie desert was amazing. Even the book that the check came in was adorable. I will go back over and over"}
{"text":"The decor is truly great! I gotta say this though, I'm a bourbon and whiskey fan. They have a HUGE selection but they are WAY overpriced. They were selling a shot a can buy in Nashville for $14, for $100! That is insane! There was some at $800 per shot.... Truly the most ridiculous pricing I've ever come across."}
{"text":"Had dinner here on Friday night to celebrate our anniversary.  The space was beautiful and our server was awesome (even gave us a complimentary glass of champagne to toast our anniversary)!  We split the Brussel Sprouts and had the Scallops, Crispy Pig Wing, and a salad.  All the dishes were great and I would definitely come back here next time we are in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was wonderful. Food was amazing. Service was great. There was a very disruptive table close to us but a manager stepped in and handle them well. Wonderful experience all around!"}
{"text":"Food is great. But atmosphere is chaotic and packed in. Had to sit at a picnic table by the door. When im dropping $100 on dinner, having to sit at a picnic table w my gf beside me kind of killed it for me."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic both times I've been here.   First time was on NYE a couple years ago, just to stop in for some drinks and check out the atmosphere. We had absinthe cocktails that were to die for.   We then returned for my birthday dinner last year and had incredible food, too. I was pregnant at the time & bummed I couldn't partake of any of the really cool cocktails they have, and they were so awesome that they made me some fancy, non-alcoholic \"cocktails\" on the fly -- the server just asked me what kind of flavors I liked, and the bartender came up with some kinda awesome thing with cloves stuffed into an orange slice that was easily one of the best drinks I've ever had, alcoholic or not.   The atmosphere is funky and very interesting, albeit a little claustrophobic with the tables very close together and so much going on all around you. I like that sort of thing (it reads more \"cozy\" to me), but if that's not your cup of tea, be warned."}
{"text":"Came to celebrate my coworker's birthday, as we got stuck in town because of the storm. Very nice atmosphere, great cuisine and impeccable service! I highly recommend and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is a straight bar/bartender review - LOVED my experience here 2 weeks ago. The bartender started by asking my friend and I what our favorite liquors were and then if she could make drink recommendations based on that. Of course we agreed and she made us some amazing cocktails! She was attentive the entire time we were there...which may have been 2.. or more drinks. Id definitely go back! I wish I would knew the bartenders name to give her a shoutout because as a prior service industry employee I know what a thankless job it can be sometimes."}
{"text":"WOW! This place was so lovely! We didn't have much time to spend, but we knew about this place and their Incredible cocktails so we had to go! They were Right! Every drink was amazing and made properly and how it's SUPPOSED to be! There was no \"half-assing \". I did research and I know they have extraordinary bartenders! So my boyfriend and I appreciate the mixology world and how it's done, we're \"judgy\" about it lol cuz we understand it as well, but wouldn't ruin the persons day if we didn't like something ya know. Lol but those cocktails were great! Perfect to taste!Very neatly done! We were so happy! Our waiter was very kind and  knew what he was talking about, and he was really cool. We didn't get to order food but you could smell it, and it was mouth watering , home kitchen smells!! Lol I'm so happy this place is in Pittsburgh and we live less than 2 hours away! Thanks Butcher and the Rye! You definitely lived up to the expectations and great reputation!! ! And the service was fabulous!! GO HERE !"}
{"text":"My steak was A. Maz. Ing. But my significant others scallops, while also A. Maz. Ing. were very sparse. We headed to Tako after the meal for some chips and salsa to fill up for the rest of the night."}
{"text":"1. Fake fancy food 2. Quality over quantity is a lie 3. Walk in hungry-leave hungry  Many other options for the same price point."}
{"text":"Some of the best food I've had in Pittsburgh...  My partner and four other friends treated me to a birthday dinner here on a Friday night in February. The place was packed, but fortunately, we had a reservation called in two or three days ahead of time. We were a table or two away from the bar, right in front of the window. I'm not a fan of places where there's no way to hear what your mates are saying-- I love a deep, thoughtful conversation, and while we had to raise our voices and repeat stuff here and there, the din of the bar didn't greatly inhibit our interaction.   For being jam packed on Friday night, wait times for food and drinks were reasonable. We ordered a bunch of small plates rather than individual entrées and our personable waiter came back often to ensure we had a great experience. The beer and cocktails were top-notch, as one would expect them to be for a place whose name ends in \"rye,\" which they have myriad types of. The Manhattan is made with a Buffalo Trace bourbon, and yeah, to me, $12 is kinda steep, but between Butcher and its sister restaurant, Meat & Potatoes, I've ordered it on multiple occasions and will continue to do so. My partner enjoyed her Pink Elephant as well.  I'm not an interior designer, so décor doesn't add or detract too much from my experience unless it's godawful. Butcher's layout and design is refined rustic that doesn't take itself too seriously, but at the same time avoids being kitschy.   The food was par excellence for upscale, contemporary American in Pittsburgh, and I'd be proud to line it up against other iterations in larger cities. The menu is cohesive, but also achieves breadth. Our group had the PEI mussels, marrow, brussels, pig candy, country ham and dry aged tartare. For dessert: the deep fried brownie and baked camembert. Take a look at the menu on the website- the flavor combinations will impress you and do more justice than I could hope to.   I'm unable to register any complaints regarding the food, and by extension, the entire establishment. I look forward to heading their again and giving their large plates a try next go around. This place is certainly worth the splurge."}
{"text":"Went here with a group of friends to find out what all the hype was about. Maybe it's because I just moved from a place where restaurants like this are a dime a dozen, but I really didn't get what all the fuss was about.   We were seated on time and had no issues with the service. Started our meal with a charcuterie board (this was the best thing we ordered, definitely worth getting!!) and the pork belly appetizer. The pork belly was good but not great. Didn't quite melt in your mouth, was a bit rubbery feeling.  For the entree I ordered a seasonal special of smoked chicken. Again, good not great. My fiance got the flank steak which I had a bite of. Wish I had ordered that. Another person with us had the dirty pasta which everyone raved about but I didn't try.  Rounded out dinner by sharing three desserts: cheesecake, apple pie, and and smores. The smores and apple pie were very good. Cheesecake was meh.   For a total bill of $150 for two people and an average dinner, won't be back any time soon. Not worth it for the money in my opinion."}
{"text":"I took my husband to Butcher and the Rye for his birthday, knowing that we would be splurging. The prices are a bit high, however, they are very fair. The small dishes are very filling and everything we ate tasted unbelievable. We had the deep fried brussels sprouts, the sunday gravy (melts in your mouth), and the pig candy. They were not particularly helpful with answering questions on gluten, so I had to be careful. We went at 6:30 on a weeknight, the place was very crowded and somewhat loud. We were seated on the top floor, which was pretty dark (hard to read the menu). However, we found it to be perfect for a romantic date with the intimacy of the small table and dim lighting. I wouldn't recommend it as a hangout unless you sit on the ground floor or at a bar. We would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"By far the best dining out experience we have ever had. You must make reservations well in advance in order to get a coveted table upstairs. The service is impeccable, and the staff is very friendly and helpful. The food was unbelievable. Easily the best meal I've had out."}
{"text":"Nice decor, hipster vibe, with animals hung up on the walls  Drinks: Bobby burns - tiny glass, slightly on the sweet side, okay maids wonder - strong whiskey after taste, not much cucumber flavor, again also okay  Started with the dry aged tartar with sous vide egg, flavorful, but I've had better, would have expected better from a place focused on cured meats  I got the burger special, patty was pretty juicy, I got medium, a little more pink than I would have though but still pretty solid  We also got the dirty pasta, which was bomb, really savory taste, not your typical sauce, slightly on the salty side but worth it, we cleared the plate hah  Recommend"}
{"text":"Just had Cocktails ---- but wow!  Great bartender with skills and imagination.  The food menu looks pretty upscale and the plates that were going by were amazing.  It was a bit loud and crowded for my taste - but good for something different.  I love a good cocktail!"}
{"text":"Time for a comprehensive review. Took my wife and daughter here on Saturday May 12th. Will go down the list.  Crispy Pig Wing - Awesomely delicious. 5 stars. Pig Candy - Awesomely delicious. 5 Stars. Mac & Cheese - Awesomely delicious - 5 Stars Lion's Tail (cocktail) - Great cocktail. A true man's drink! Moscow Mule (cocktail - minus jalapeno) - My wife absolutely loved it.  These were our appetizers.  No time fore the main courses.  We purchased 3.  Hanger Steak (medium) - Awesomely delicious - 5 stars  Scallops - 4 stars. Scallops were cooked to perfection.  Asparagus cooked to perfection.  However I took issue with the blue crab risotto. My wife loved it.  For me, the taste was good, but it had a \"This will get old fast\" type of taste.  I can't explain it.  But I knew that I could not finish a bowl of that risotto.  After a few bites, I was done.  Overall I thought the dish was good. My wife would order this dish again without a doubt.  RABBIT \"COQ AU VIN\" - 3 stars - This was a good dish.  The highlight of the dish was the crispy chicken skin in my opinion. The dish itself was well put together.  There was no aspect of the dish that I disliked.  But the fact of the matter is that this dish didn't make me want to slap my mama.  It was good.  It wasn't great.  I would not order it again. I will enjoy eating the leftovers tonight, no doubt.  But I though the rabbit could have been prepared in a more memorable way.  Dessert - We had the apple Pie\", which has a salted caramel theme. Comes with a side of creme cheese. - 5 stars - Awesomely delicious.  Overall, we would definitely go back.  An interesting thing about this place.  This is the only place we ever went to that has such a large alcohol selection, the bar tender uses a ladder to get to all the bottles.  Their cocktail menu is stupendous.  The atmosphere is excellent.  We will be going back!"}
{"text":"The whiskey list is insane. The ipad app they use for the list is fairly easy to navigate, so the giant list they have isn't as daunting. If you're still not sure, just ask the server and they'll be able to recommend you a few different ones. Get the bone marrow."}
{"text":"(11/11/2014)  This one has got to go on your list, Butcher and the Rye was the star of our 2-day, 8-stop, self-guided restaurant crawl of dahntahn Pittsburgh.  Its sister restaurant, Meat and Potatoes gets all the press play, but the older and more sophisticated Butcher and the Rye is better experience of the two.  Both plates we tried had thoughtful, balanced flavors and contrast of textures.  The Dry Aged Tartare had some wonderful garnishes to accentuate the marbled beef (diced a touch large, chewy at times).  I appreciated the crunchy texture of radishes and mache, and brightness of parsley oil, and tart pickled mustard seed as foils to the richness of the slow cooked egg and black garlic aioli.  PEI mussels were cooked until just done, plump and bursting, came with a totally addictive red curry (had some heat), coconut milk, tomato, lime and cilantro liqueur.  The rest of the menu straddles upscale comfort food and creative palate adventures.  Service, at the bar at least, was spot on and friendly.  Cocktails were very good (but can't remember what I had, something with Buffalo Trace).  Decor is like being in an ersatz old timey Western movie hotel, check out the pistol and butcher's knives on the taps and wall of bourbon (bourbon lover's paradise) and blanched antler chandelier. I so loved everything about this place up until I had to go to the bathroom.  A grown up place needs some real bathrooms, I will leave it at that.  If you try this place (and you must), you'll know what I mean."}
{"text":"This place is so cool and delish. Must haves: the shishito, dry aged tartare and sea bass.  All had such interesting flavors and design."}
{"text":"Walked here from the convention center in about 10 minutes. This place came with heavy recommendation from several people. My first impression of the place was great. Huge American Flag hanging to the right of the entry door. In a time of such tension I appreciate the display of pride! The rest of the place has a trendy, eclectic vibe. Of all the bars I have been to this place has the coolest feel.   We sat at the first floor bar, went upstairs but it was slow so we opted for more activity downstairs. Our bartender Giuseppe (hope that's spelled right) was prompt and informative. We were told this place has hundreds of whiskeys on hand..... and that's no joke! If you have any interest in whiskey this is the spot.   During the time it took to have a few drinks we bothered Giuseppe with several questions. He answered them all without hesitation. My impression of Giuseppe is he is a true bartender. It is clear he has a passion for what he does. He worked up an \"Old Fashion\" for me and it was top notch. Keep up the good work!   When some friends arrived we moved to a table away from the bar. I had the \"Phillips Head\" and it was a good drink. We did not eat so I can not provide any guidance on food.   If I lived here this would be added into my to my rotation of places. Great service, awesome vibe, draws a good crowd."}
{"text":"Phenomenal. Visiting from the west coast, I chose this as an anniversary dinner spot and it did not disappoint. Creative and on-point cocktails (I had the Wild Kind -bourbon, smoked honey, Thai chili oil), dim and sort of prohibition era-meets-hunting lodge atmosphere, and the food was truly indulgent. The bone marrow is a must, and the saffron mussel soup, duck liver pate, tartare with truffle egg, and dirty pasta with duck are also incredible. If you are looking for a classy place for a nice dinner in a Pittsburgh, this should be a top contender. They also have a lounge area upstairs which looked intimate and might not have as long of a wait as a regular table."}
{"text":"The food and the service were both great! I would highly recommend the mac and cheese and the New York strip steak. Awesome meal!"}
{"text":"The best bone marrow I've had, and I've had many. Fergus would be proud. And accompanied by pulled oxtail - meat as a side with meat! Their tartar was also awesome, and generous, with some super tasty smears of aioli. Mt. Clarity Punch & Blackthorn were excellent cocktails, and the Vidal Fleury Ventoux was a surprisingly good wine by the glass.  The nettle spaghetti was not up to the same level. Service was polite and attentive."}
{"text":"Butcher and the Rye lives up to the hype. The atmosphere is modern, eclectic, and rich. The atmosphere and high standard of service prepares you for the meal that you are about to experience. The artisan cheese board combined wonderful cheese, fruit, and spread options. The scallops dish and the dirty pasta were both rich and flavorful. Service was attentive without being intrusive. The location is perfect along with the portion sizes."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the energetic atmosphere. Our waiter was extremely knowledgeable about cooking. He spent time discussing the menu options. My husband ordered the lamb neck, cooked to perfection. My beet salad was lovely and we also enjoyed a delicious cheese plate. Recommended!"}
{"text":"My wife and I came here the other day because we knew the manager working here and were not disappointed.  We were sat on the second floor and were made to feel like ballers.  haha.  First off, the decor was exceptional.  The wall of alcohol is truly amazing.  Second, the food was just off the charts.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Everything here was delicious. We had reservations for a Friday night and were seated at a big communal table. It was basically a large picnic table for 6 people. At first when we got there, it seemed really loud and we couldn't hear each other very well, especially with 2 other couples right next to us. We adjusted quickly and ended up not minding the seating.  The cocktails were delicious. My favorite was the Blackthorn, which tasted heavily of absinthe to me, but I love absinthe so it works out, but they were all delicious. I'd definitely want to go  We started with the brussels sprouts, which were amazing. Nice and crisp, with a lot of Parmesan cheese. My boyfriend got the pork and lobster sugo, which was tasty. I only had a bite, but he thought that the pork was nice and tender and flavorful. I got the scallops with risotto, which was perfect. The scallops were so well done and I loved the risotto with mushrooms.   I loved the food here and definitely would go back. It's a little dark and really loud and chaotic, but I loved the decor and the food and drinks make it 100% worth checking out."}
{"text":"I almost wanted to dock them because we had to wait an hour past our reservation time to be seated, but our meal was so good I just don't have the heart!  Love the atmosphere here.  Our server was awesome and  knowledgeable.  I had the filet and it was delicious.  My husband has one of their specials - the Shepherd's Pie, and the lamb was so tender.  Everything was perfection.  Well done, and worth the hour wait!"}
{"text":"This place is out of this world. The pig candy is like something that went straight from heaven to the plate. Love it love it love it love it!!!"}
{"text":"I got to eat at Butcher and the Rye for my birthday earlier this year, after years of talking about visiting it. It was a delight!  My family and I made reservations for 5pm, right as the restaurant opened for dinner. Good thing, too - the line of fellow diners waiting for dinner to start literally stretched out the door and down part of the sidewalk. The restaurant was full within minutes of officially opening for evening service. So yeah: reservations are definitely recommended here!   Despite the place being full of people immediately from the start of service, we never felt neglected during our visit. The dining staff were prompt and efficient, as were the extra busy bartenders. I especially want to thank the staff for patiently explaining parts of the menu to my excited carnivore father. He was having trouble selecting an order and had a lot of questions, all of which were answered thoroughly.  He ended up ordering one of their specials at the time, while I opted for scallops atop a blue crab risotto; my brother the roasted chicken; and my mother the brussels appetizer. Everything was fantastic! The cuts of meat were tender; the main and side dishes alike were well and uniquely seasoned; and the meal as whole was expertly crafted and very deserving of the prices being charged for each plate. In addition to enjoying the samples from my family's plates, my risotto - despite being a bit rich - was such a tasty delight that I just HAD to eat every bite of it!  We all left full and satisfied, and all agreed that we would happily come back for a future special occasion. Thank you for the amazing birthday noms, guys!"}
{"text":"Butcher never disappoints! I went for my fourth time and it had been a year so I wanted to see if it was still as good, definitely was. I had the scallops and my friend had the fillet. Pig candy appetizer was just as good as the first time I had it years ago. Don't change anything and stay delicious!"}
{"text":"Everything is good here. The steaks were tender, perfectly cooked and seasoned, and melts in your mouth. The chicken and potatoes were all amazing. I'd make sure to also try all the sauces.   The line for the restaurant can also get really long so I'd try to time it by coming in off peak hours if you don't have too much time. Despite those things, I will definitely try to come back."}
{"text":"Fair disclaimer;  my first visit to Pittsburgh.  However, I'm an avid food, wine, and cocktail hound who has been to nearly every other corner of this country and most of the big cities many times.    BnR has excellent fare, unique and properly executed cocktails, and a cool decor, all backed by very friendly and professional service.   The rabbit is absolutely splendid.   If you can get past images of Bugs and Peter, it should be considered de rigueur on this menu!   The steak tartare is excellent as well.  I'll be returning as soon as I next find myself in this fine city!  Gregory J."}
{"text":"Walked in without a reservation and there was a long wait but luckily I was eating alone and there was plenty of bar space. The bartender was super busy but made me feel right at home and was very attentive. I recommend the bar for a party of 1 or 2 just for the service alone.  He had some great drink recommendations. Pig candy is a must as well as the s'mores. Definitely coming back on my next trip."}
{"text":"We have NEVER been disappointed here and Friday night was no exception.  The manager immediately answered our bourbon questions and brought the iPad out for our guest to choose.  Our guests flew in from Chicago to join us at the Cubs vs Pirates games this past Fri/Sat and this was the perfect meal to start our weekend!  Thanks so much!"}
{"text":"I would say that if you have a suicidal death wish by salt, then by all means come eat here!    High Blood Pressure?  Need a \"little\" salt in your diet?  Sarcasm and a meal here might kill you.  The Dirty Pasta was like eating a dish (of salt) of salty pasta in uber-salty gravy.  The Pig Candy was one (1) piece of what a Chinese restaurant would serve a whole plate of.  It was ok, just yes, salty.  Mussels were just ok, have had better.  The flourless chocolate cake was a disappointment :-(  definitely have had better!  Highlight of the nite: my drink - the BEST Smith & Currins I have ever had.  She did a great job on that!    Overall, the ambience of the place is nice - but dark, oh so dark.  So if you pass out from all the salt, they might not find your body til the lights come on (if ever)."}
{"text":"the atmosphere is fun but very few people in our party of 10 liked their food.  But then again, we aren't the fanciest people (ex: they have shepards pie with mashed potato FOAM).  Also its super weird how short the bathroom stalls are.  I don't like looking at people while I pee."}
{"text":"From the moment you walk in you will be blown away, the decor is truly something incredible. I've never had bad service here, never had a bad meal, and I've definitely never had a bad drink. Drinks in the main dining room are something, but if you want to really experience a phenomenal drink, reserve yourself a seat at the upstairs bar and ask for Cecil. He'll ask you what you typically drink, and from that he will concoct for you the most amazing thing you've ever had. Just from me telling him I like red wine and vodka he put together a drink for me of items I've never had before and it is exactly something that I would drink again and again. In fact, after looking at the extensive drink menu I had been pulled back to one particular drink but hadn't mentioned it and that was the exact drink that he ended up making for me. One of my favorite places to visit in Pittsburgh, hands-down."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh!  This places makes you feel as if you are in NYC not the burg.  It's 2 floors are tastefully decorated and there are small separate dining rooms that add a nice touch of intimacy to your dining experience.  I have been here on 2 separate occasions.  The drink menu is a old Rolodex type of phone book which is cute, but can be tough if it's broken as mine was.    I LOVE BRUSSEL SPROUTS, and if you feel the same these are the BEST I have ever had.  I have eating all over american Chicago, LA, NOLA, Portland, Seattle, NYC, Philly, Miami, and if they are on a menu I order them.  This place hands down are the best ever.  They are served roasted topped with Parm and a delicious dipping sauce.    I have eaten the following items here over my 2 visits:  1. Skirt Steak - delicious, my least fav, but not awful at all 2. Cheese plate - great cheese and accompaniments 3.Leek soup - Just awesome, the pork belly takes it to the next level 4. Scallops with blue crab risotto - one of the best entrees I have eaten in a long time.  The portion, favor combo, presentation are perfection 5. Brussel Sprouts - See above, AMAZING!  The drinks are also delicious!  I have had the old fashioned each time I have been.  They also have my favorite champagne by the glass available, Veuve Clicquot Rose!!!  Make sure you make a reservation at least a week of 2 in advance, it fills up fast here."}
{"text":"This place was definitely packed on a Friday night but somehow we were able to score seats at the bar.  Bartenders were great; Manhattan was on point (with good cherry!).  Shared the brussel sprouts, which were great and the preserved lemon aioli was a great pairing and had a really nice presentation.  also, at bartender's suggestion, tried the bacon candy.  was a little apprehensive as I'm not always on the pork belly bandwagon--sometimes it is just too fatty and, well, just grosses me out.  but this one was great.  it was cooked SO well so it had some crunch, some chewiness (in a good way) and some, I don't know, denseness? just delicious. the miso caramel sauce was a great combo of sweet and savory.  So why 4 stars instead of 5? it was a tough decision, as far as Yelp goes :) and maybe I am being too critical but...here goes:  there was a lot of cilantro on the bacon candy, which was good.  But a lot of it was mostly long stems, or long stems with one leaf, so I found myself picking the leaves off and putting the stems to the side.  Did I have to do this? probably not, but did it make the dish a lot better, to me? yep.  also, and i know it's because it is a \"hot spot\" and whatever else, but I felt the bar area was sort of chaotic (NOT behind the bar; bartenders were great) and could have been a bit better managed so as not to be constantly jostled by other patrons and servers (whose way everyone was certainly in) :)   I would definitely go back though and look forward to trying the other spots in this group."}
{"text":"Highly recommend this restaurant! We were looking for a delicious bite to eat after a long drive from NYC and checked out butcher and the rye (partly because of the s'more dessert) and it was excellent. Small plates are quite reasonable in size. The pig wing was our favorite followed by the dirty pasta and the bone marrow. We ordered the shishito peppers for something green but they weren't anything special. We weren't that impressed by the pig candy but other reviewers seemed to love it. The only strange thing about the restaurant was that they had a lot of open tables but originally told us they were full- maybe they didn't have enough staff or they were making a statement because we didn't have a reservation? It all worked out in the end. Best bet is probably to make a reservation. Also great selection of beer and whiskey."}
{"text":"Outstanding ambiance, delicious drinks, and outstanding customer service, what more can you ask for?   I didn't have the opportunity to try and they're delicious looking food, but did have a few drinks at the bar before going to Heinz Hall. The location is outstanding, centrally located in the heart of the city. I wish I would have had the opportunity to take photos of my delicious drinks, but was running late for the show. I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Perfect atmosphere, beautiful presentation. Great spot for after work cocktails, or before a game bite...awesome place!"}
{"text":"One of the best places to eat and drink in town. The cocktails are delicious, the food is outstanding. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Super busy and crowded! Even with reservations, it took 20 Minutes to be seated. The decor was beautiful and they have a great farm to table feel. Probably the best mac and cheese I've ever had, it isn't to be missed!"}
{"text":"I don't usually get drunk. I mean, I get tipsy from two glasses of wine, so it's the very rare occasion when I'll have more than one cocktail. The drinks are so incredible at Butcher and the Rye that I may have had three... Maybe.   This place is super cool. Moody, hip and cool, actually. Immediately upon entering you know it's the place to be. In addition to being moody, hip and cool they happen to make some of the best cocktails in the city so they have the klout to back up their moodiness.   I highly suggest heading up the staircase to the upstairs bar. The dudes behind the bar are master mixers -- they really know what they're doing. I loved seeing them gracefully shift from one drink to the next, chatting away with their customers and always maintaining a polite, kind demeanor without ever missing a joke or a request. They're so talented, I went off menu and put my drink completely in the hands of Jay, who hit it out of the park every single time with his well-balanced and creative cocktails. Hency Hily having three, and Hily getting drunk.   If you're a cocktail person in the mood for something fun, slightly old-school and a little bit different, check out Butcher and the Rye. It's a bar (and the cause of a killer hangover) I'll not soon forget!"}
{"text":"Butcher and the Rye totes one of the best whiskey and bourbon selections in Pittsburgh. Great centralized location in downtown Pittsburgh off of penn Avenue. The second floor bar is a great place to lounge and enjoy a verity of small plates and appetizers as well as expertly crafted cocktails. The bourbon selection can be browsed on an iPad offered by the bar tenders if you can't make out the bottles on the wall. If your passing through town this is one of the best spots Pittsburgh has to offer, make sure to make the stop."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely amazing. The menu is complex and well put together to include all of your fine dining staples. I tried the pappardelle, and it was the best I've had in Pittsburgh. It was definitely homemade and fresh.  I also really enjoyed the ambiance here. The atmosphere is both rustic and contemporary, with a dimly lit dining room. The dining room and bar area are both warm and inviting.   The only downside (and should not be a consideration when considering this restaurant ) is that this place gets very busy. If you go on the weekend, there is almost certainly going to be a wait. The bar seats are also difficult to score; however, there's a second bar upstairs, which usually has some open seats.   The price is fair and commensurate with the quality of the dishes and the experience. The staff is extremely knowledgeable and professional. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I was in town for work last week so one of my co-workers recommended we stop by Butcher and the Rye for dinner.  So glad she did.  I called to make a reservation and they told me we would be sitting at a communal table.  Hey...why not.    We ordered the pig wing, brussels (way too salty but still good), cauliflower and the mac and cheese. I also had the Jack Rose from the drink menu.  All were delicious.   The highlight is that we had the best night with our fellow diners!  We talked all night and ended up getting contact info so we could link up the next time we're in town.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Boy that Samantha strikes again!!  Another excellent dinner at Butcher and the Rye.  Samantha recommended the trout, flank, pig wing, and pot de creme.  Without her guidance I couldn't imagine dining here."}
{"text":"Super well put together food with quality drinks. Started with the pig candy, brussels, and Sunday gravy. All were amazing. For dinner I suggest the dirty pasta, but I'm pretty sure you can't go wrong with anything they offer. My fork traveled around the table, everything was badass. I'll be back"}
{"text":"Well the food was delicious!! Unfortunately, we had a negative interaction with the manager after the hostess offered to cover a few starters when we had to wait awhile to sit (we had a reservation). We mentioned it to our waitress and she sent the manager (Brian) over to our table. He showed up, immediately started talking down to us, and eventually loudly announced, among other things and with a bit of attitude, \"No, I don't think that's gonna happen...\" In front of my whole family. What an awkward and unprofessional way to handle the situation... Instead of a free starter, we had asked if they would consider a reasonable discount on a $50 bottle of wine they have on their menu for $125. The bizarre, confrontation-esque conversation made us feel uncomfortable and we decided to leave. We weren't trying to take advantage of anyone and didn't really appreciate being treated that way. Brian could have said just about anything else and it would have been totally fine... He didn't have to be such a jerk."}
{"text":"What do Black Dahlia, Wild Kind, Salinger's Sling, Kentucky Tea Party Punch, and Maid's Wonder have in common? 1. Fantastic cocktails 2. hand crafted by the amazing bar manager, Kimber, that 3. collectively put me on my arse that night. Man oh man, I can't wait to go back to Pittsburgh to have a full meal at this place. If the food is as good as the drinks I'll be in for a treat! The menu looked amazing too, but we had already eaten and this was our \"night cap\". The restaurant came recommended and I know why. It had a nice intimate vibe upstairs - there were dining tables on one end and a more chill lounge area (with full service) on the other. We sat at the bar in good hands with Kimber. We asked a ton of questions about ingredients and what to try next and she never led us astray. I honestly don't remember much after the fact BUT I think Black Dahlia was the winner! Shocker for me because I (used to) hate rye (but love bourbon) and (knowingly putting) egg whites in drinks seems weird. Wrong. I was wrong. We were all wrong. Divine combination!"}
{"text":"Great spot: atmosphere, drinks, crowd.  The best spot downtown by far for late night."}
{"text":"I don't think there's a better restaurant in pittsburgh these days .. The good was incredible ..."}
{"text":"Came here because we enjoyed Meat and Potatoes.  Had the deconstructed Shepherd's Pie both times.  First was sublime, second time not as good because the carrots were too sweet.  Second was on a weekday, so maybe the weekend crew is better.  Still giving it a 5 because I though everything was tasty.  Reservations are hard to get which is pretty annoying, but you can sit at the bar."}
{"text":"OUTSTANDING!!! I am from out of town and would go there again and again.  I sat at the bar, they have a very helpful staff and know how to treat their customers.  I also at the steak....to die for (Pittsburgh Style).  My brother in law had the scallops and he really enjoyed them.  A must stop if downtown."}
{"text":"Great decorum when you walk in.  I got seated on the second floor.  I had the mac & cheese and wagyu flank steak.  Delicious.  However, what sets this place apart from others is the Bourbon menu.  I enjoyed Pappy Van Winkle 23 and haven't scratched the surface.  If you like Bourbon this is a must try."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to dining at Butcher and the Rye but left a little disappointed. I did like several of the veggie dishes, particularly the Brussel sprouts. However several were a bit greasy. My friend ordered the pig candy and had to send it back. She found it way to fatty and gelatinous. They do have some interesting cocktails and a good wine list. We drank the red wine that was on special ($8 vs $13) and were quite pleased with it. The space is beautiful and nicely decorated. It wasn't overly noisy; we were able to hold a conversation and hear each other. Our server was helpful in explaining the menu."}
{"text":"Pittsburg is central for all my transit friends to meet up as we're all shooting projects outside this city.  This was the drink spot we found after bailing out on \"Six Pence's\" pompous service on a tasteless first course.  We would have at here, but the wait was long and we were super hungry so we came back for drinks.  Well worth the trip back for drinks as there's 2 bars that have different drink menus.   The aesthetic was tasteful mix of rustic modern, great details with a \"Top Hat\" chandeliers and dear details all throughout the lounge/dinning experience.  Charm, wit, and elegance define the space, plus the drinks (Yuzu sour and Moscow Mule) were well mixed.   We're coming back as day 2 of our evening meetings to try dinner.  Besos."}
{"text":"WOW. WOW. WOW.   The mac and cheese is absolutely the BEST mac and cheese I have ever had in my entire life. I'm more partial to stovetop (creamy) mac and cheese than I am to the eggy kind that's baked in an oven, and this totally hit the spot! Rich and garlicky, I wanted to lick the bowl when it was gone. I also tried the lamb gravy, which was like the richest bolognese I've ever had. Really excellent.  The decor is like a shabby chic hunting season goth nightmare--including the best use of velvet wallpaper I've seen in a while. Cool and dark on a hot summer day, and the light fixtures made from antlers lend a True Detective air to the dining room. You sit on mismatched wooden chairs and, if you're upstairs, eat guarded by a massive taxidermied grizzly bear. The \"wall of whiskey\" is rather impressive, though I'm not partial to whiskey myself. I did have a very nice rye cocktail, the Rye Buck, which I can only liken to a thinking woman's whiskey sour. The Hazel-Rah, a take on a mai tai made with hazelnut bitters, is also delicious.  We were lucky enough to be able to score a reservation here pretty easily, but it DOES fill up quite quickly, so the sooner you call for a place the better. There are some communal tables in the front that are first-come-first-serve, but every time I've walked past here right after opening, they're filled up, so I think those may be difficult to get as well. So call them up and get ready for the best mac and cheese everrrrr. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh. The first time we went I got the scallops with blue crab risotto which is to die for and going back last night I ended up trying the short rib. Very tasty! The meat fell right off the bone and was so tender. Also, the pig candy is a must! The sauce goes perfectly with it. I had a few specialty cocktails (Jessica Rabbit) which were amazing as well. Good atmosphere and fantastic food!"}
{"text":"You have heard it's good- but it really does live up to the hype. I made a reservation way in advance. The atmosphere is very cool- trendy but still welcoming.  All of the food at my table had some type of meat in it and each was great in its own way.   5 stars for a great meal!"}
{"text":"Excellent appetizers and cocktails. Funky decor."}
{"text":"My husband and i thoroughly enjoyed our evening at the Butcher. We had the mac and cheese and tartare as starters which were both delicious. Our main courses were the scallops with blue crap risotto and the \"dirty\" spaghetti with ground duck- which was divine! Not sure of the type of noodles used but we LOVED it. Both entrees were very rich, flavorful and tasty. Service was quality and the weather outside warm and sunny...all in all a great experience!"}
{"text":"Killer restaurant, probably the best drinks and food I've had in Pittsburgh.  Came here for a business dinner and was not disappointed.  Here were the highlights:  - Pig Candy - Charcuterie Plate - Burrata Cheese - Shepherd's Pie (It's beef cheeks instead of ground beef and potato foam instead of mashed) - Deconstructed Smores for dessert  You can't really go wrong with cocktails here, that's for sure.  Everything is complex and legit."}
{"text":"They bring the terms \"Craft Cocktail\" to a whole new meaning. When you walk in, you are greeted by the rolls of butcher paper on the wall with their daily specials written on them and a boar's head on the wall by the stairs - awesome. The downstairs bar is as far as I needed to go, with whiskey bottles stacked up so high they needed a ladder to get them down. I had a few cocktails with different rye whiskey's and was very pleased with the results. The bartenders know what they are doing and can do much much more than what the pre-written menus have to offer. It's a great place to check out if you're looking for a classier night on the town."}
{"text":"Amazing!   Had two appetizers, three main courses and a dessert.  Plus drinks App of octopus was just so:so but everything else was seriously some of the best food.   Had the Rabbit Coq au vin - tender, perfect taste.  Cassoulet was complex and not a bite left.  Steak was perfect.  Drinks totally fun!  Great service.   Perfect night out."}
{"text":"This place was a TREAT! I went there with my brother, his partner and my husband and had a fabulous dinner. I had mussels for an appetizer and someone else got the pork candy. Both were amazing. My dinner was the scallops and they were absolutely scrumptious. My husband got the Shepherds Pie, with foam mashed potatoes and beef cheek and it was absolutely out of this world. Our server was also very friendly and funny. Will be back next time I'm in the \"Burgh\"."}
{"text":"Very cool decor and vibe. The place is spacious, with three floors including two different bars. The food and cocktails that I tried were excellent. I would go back."}
{"text":"I had one bad experience with their mussles and it was bad but it still tasted really good overall with everything and they took the food back and brought a fresh batch. You have to make a reservation at this place couple weeks ahead of time in order to get a seating anywhere."}
{"text":"I had a fantastic time here with friends last week. My friend made a reservation for us about a month in advance, so when the time came to finally go, it felt like Christmas morning. Almost.  I absolutely adore the decor-rustic luxe meets shabby chic. There are hundreds of bourbons and whiskeys on the wall of the downstairs bar, and it's a really beautiful focal point. We were seated downstairs, and had a great view of the fun fabric wallpapers and cute cottage-style mirrors on the walls.   There were four of us, and we wanted to sample a variety of items, so we ordered most of the small plates on the menu and shared them. My favorites were the brussels, the shishitos, the mac and cheese, and the fresh foccacia with whipped ricotta. The brussels sprouts were crispy and perfectly tender. Shishito peppers are one of my favorite things in the entire universe (not even joking), so I was in heaven when I saw them on the menu. A spicy cream sauce accompanied them on the side and the creamy decadence of it balanced out the shishitos nicely. The mac and cheese was gooey and heavy and oh so creamy. I'm glad I only had a few bites. It was fantastic, but all that heaviness would have done me in had I devoured the whole thing myself. They always have a fresh bread special, and it was nice to have some bread for the table to balance out the other dishes. I generally try to avoid bread, but this foccacia was to die for. It was puffy and fluffy and went perfectly with the whipped ricotta that I slathered all over it.   We also ordered the caulfilower with farro, the crispy pig skin, and the pig candy. These dishes were fantastic as well, although I preferred the lighter, vegetable-based dishes. For dessert, we couldn't decide between the options, so we ordered three! We ordered the pot de creme, sticky buns, and the deep fried brownie. The dark chocolate pot de creme was my favorite, and I would order it again in a heartbeat. It was creamy and rich, but not overly so. The sticky buns were super sweet, but the nuts covering them added a hint of salt that balanced out the dish somewhat. Definitely on the sweet side for me, but a fun dish to try! I couldn't force myself to try the deep fried brownie because I was stuffed to the gills by this point, but my friend gobbled it up and said it was one of the best desserts she'd ever eaten. That's saying something!   Drinks were delicious as well. I had a non-alcoholic ginger concoction, and it was spicy and sweet at the same time. The wine list is fairly extensive, and my husband was able to find several reds that he enjoyed. My beer connoiseur friend was content with his beer selections, and my cocktail-loving friend enjoyed the house punch of the day very much!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"As my husband and I left the restaurant tonight, we both agreed it was hands down the best dining experience we've had in years. From the start, the staff was so welcoming and friendly. We arrived at 5:45pm for a 6 o'clock reservation on a Saturday night, but they seated us on the spot. We were seated at a small two top, right under the watchful eye of a giant stuffed black bear wearing a bowler hat. I loved the kitschy, rustic charm of the place right away.   We each had cocktails and started with two small plates, the focaccia bread and the crispy pig wing. The bread was served with three spreads; a white bean purée, an olive tempenade and a ricotta cheese spread. All so perfect with the warm bread. But, the pig wing. Oh the pig wing. Sweet and spicy, crispy and tender. It was amazing. I'm surprised we didn't fight over it.   I then had the Brussels sprouts and the Mac and cheese, two more small plates, while the husband had the scallops. Everything was served hot and beautifully plated. We shared our dishes, and the risotto that came with my husband's scallops was so good, I kept stealing bites. But my Brussels sprouts were hands down  my favorite part of the main course. Tossed in brown butter and served with a yummy lemon aoli, I could have eaten a pound of them. If 10 year old me would hear me raving over Brussels sprouts, she'd probably smack me, but they were really  that good.   I have to say the only negative is that the place is a little cramped; you are only about 12 inches from the diners on either side of you. But, the food was so good it honestly didn't matter, and they decorated the small space in such an inventive and playful way, it was so much fun to look around.  I also absolutely loved that the check is presented to you in a little book that you can write comments in about your experience. Ours was perfect."}
{"text":"I love the look of this place, with its sort of Boardwalk Empire meets Downton Abbey meets modern day PIttsburgh vibe. And the menu reads very well, with interesting and innovative choices. It's in the execution of the food where things fall apart. I tried three small plates...the shishito peppers, caesar salad and the pork terrine. The peppers came in a nicely charred pile, but didn't have enough of the sriracha sauce that was minimally painted on the plate. Not bad, just a little ho hum. The caesar had good flavors, but was egregiously over dressed, and was a smallish salad for the price, with more bread than salad. The pork terrine was good...the best thing I had. I've eaten at Meat & Potatoes a couple of times and thought it very good, so they may be spreading themselves too thin by opening this place, with two others soon to follow. They also kept burning the toast for the salad, which everyone seemed to be ordering, and the place was full of smoke halfway through our meal, which never dissipated, so they need a better exhaust system. They spent a lot of time and creativity here on the drink end of things...now they need to get their act together in the kitchen."}
{"text":"I gave this place a try, still think Meat & Potatoes is better though. The Sunday Gravy appetizer was the best part of the whole dinner. It sounds simple, but it's more flavorful than even my entree. For that, I had the seared scallops. The blue crab risotto was nice and creamy, but the dish didn't blow my mind like the appetizer did. I was not a fan of the cocktails. They were all strange combinations in tiny portions, for more money than they were worth."}
{"text":"After visiting the Andy Warhol Museum, we went to cultural district for dinner. Meat and Potato was full, so we came here. Ordered chicken and dirty pasta. The flavor was good. We sat outside, so it feels good to see people wandering on the street on a Friday night. After paying the bill, they will give you a notebook to write anything you want, funny."}
{"text":"OMG! What a great place! Food was superb and Courtney was an awesome waitress. The staff that brought us the excellent food explained the dishes with expertise. Atmosphere was casual but a feel that every person was important. Recommend getting reservations- but we were walk-ins and still had the best experience from everyone we came in contact with. Recommend the crusty octopus when available and the Brussels are a must have!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing. Drinks were a bit over priced and service wasn't what you'd expect at an otherwise stellar restaurant, but the food is delicious! Hats off to the chef for creative, unique, and delicious dishes cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"Walking into this place the bar and restaurant is visually impressive, but thats about as good as it gets. Had the Candy Bacon, which lacked any seasoning and the skin was limp instead of crispy as I would have expected having had similar pork belly dishes at various other restaurants across the country. I also had the short ribs which were equally if not even more bland, frankly they were perfectly braised and tender, however they lacked any seasoning or flavor. Bland food was the theme I came away with for this 'gastropub'...   A little bit of salt goes a long way and would have made this a 4-5 star. I would personally pair either of these dishes with various smoked sea salts and the short ribs would have been perfect, the pork belly still would have lacked the crispiness expected."}
{"text":"Go for the bourbon/scotch/whiskey/rye selection. Find Alison, their best bartender. She was so DOPE at knowing her stuff, & it's totally worth letting her take you on a bourbon/scotch/rye adventure. Re: food, the menu could be developed better. Yes yes, I know it wants to be a meat place, but there's no reason to make everything pork fat dependent. Vegetarians could have a nice time there with a little more thought to dish adaptability. The Brussels were way over cooked. Cauliflower saved the day. Great ambiance and attention to physical detail."}
{"text":"I hate to update my review from 5 stars based on one bad experience but it was so disappointing! We made reservations a week in advance and upon arrival, we were told our table wasn't ready yet. We waited by the front door since the bar area was already three people deep. At the time, the community tables were empty so not a big deal, there was room to stand. After 15 minutes, we got a txt saying our table was ready which ended up being at the community table next to the front door/bar/hallway to Tako AND it was in between two other couples who were also just sat. You expect me to sit sandwiched between two couples at a picnic table for date night, and still pay a ridiculously high price for our meals?! We were told that if we wanted an actual table, we should have called for a reservation vs going through their website. The earliest they could seat us at a table for two was at 10:30, 1.5 hours after our reservations. Appreciate the lousy effort."}
{"text":"Awesome bar with great bartenders and an incredible whiskey & bourbon selection. My Manhattan was excellent. Food was very delicious too."}
{"text":"I mean c'mon!!!  Came here for a late dinner on business. I literally devoured everything that was put infront of me.  The atmosphere here is qwerky and fun. Lots of animals on the walls. The attention to detail really shows!  The shishito peppers were amazing and the \"pig candy\" was delish. I ordered the seared scallops with risotto and could of licked the plate clean.    Even their cocktails are perfectly mastered.   I can't say enough. The only con is that everyone knows how great it is so you must have a reservation and if you don't you will need to go early and find a seat at the bar."}
{"text":"Incredible old fashioned cocktail. Very impressed! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! Call well in advance for a reservation. I called on a Tuesday for a Saturday reservation, and all they had left were a 5:30pm & 8:30pm seating. The cocktails were creative, and refreshingly tasty. For dinner we shared four appetizers and a dessert. Two appetizers were small - pork belly and pork wing. The pork wing I would order again. It was crispy with a nice peanut sauce. The pork belly was good, but didn't stand out from other pork belly appetizers I have ordered at other restaurants. Plus it was a little too chewy for my liking. The other two appetizers we ordered were fairly large in size. We selected the mac and cheese which had a crunchy breadcrumb topping, and the brussel sprouts. I never thought I would say this when I had pork and cheesy goodness in front of me, but the brussel sprouts were my favorite dish. They were charred just right, and had a creamy dill sauce to compliment them. As for dessert, we ordered cinnamon sugar doughnut balls accompanied by cardamom ice cream. This dinner was very satisfying, and I can see why you need to make a reservation early in the week!"}
{"text":"I missed out on the cocktails, since I wasn't feeling so well and one can be seated at 5pm on a Thursday evening sans reservation!  The pig candy is delicious and strangely perfect. The hand pulled burrata was equally tasty.   Dirty pasta was good and the pumpkin cheesecake was decent. But the pot de creme egg nog that evening? Sinful. So good, it hurts. I clearly ordered the wrong dessert.    Also, big kudos to the decorator. Every time I looked away or stared off in the distance, I'd discover something new. Service was also excellent."}
{"text":"I don't even know what to say.  Between our crowd of four we managed to check off the following from the menu:  Cauliflower: Not your grandmother's cauliflower.  I mean SERIOUSLY. This dish was so delectable, I'd consider an all-cauliflower diet forever, if this version was on standby.  Mac N Cheese: A lovely little cast iron pot of tender mac n cheese. Who doesn't love THAT?! Could've used a little kick of some kind, but I enjoyed it just the same.  Pig Candy:  I couldn't remember this dish too well given that I was caught up in my Santa Cider from Arsenal at the time, but as Jonathan D. reminded me, it was \"Big ******* piece of pork belly.\"  A little crispy around the edges and all-around delicious.  Country Ham:  This isn't Honeybaked. This is fresh from the Charcuterie kinda stuff.  A little salty; but that's the ham's fault.  Still, a worthwhile dish I might consider again.  Dirty Pasta:  Pasta.  Meat.  Sauce.  Sausage?  Don't know, don't care. Delicious.  And I don't even like pasta. Yeah, that's right.   Mussels:  I ordered the Mussels & Brussels; two separate dishes, one hilarious joke.  The Mussels were reminiscent of the mussels at Meat & Potatoes - not surprising given their owners.  Just like M & P, these mussels did not disappoint.  Bathed in a creamy curry, they are \"slimy yet satisfying\" (quick, name that Disney movie).   Brussel Sprouts:  I'm one of those people that eats strange things in the car.  Some people eat McDonald's, I eat olives or entire cans of Reddi Whip.  If I could somehow manage it, these grilled brussel sprouts would be top of that list.  These bad boys of baby cabbages are so wonderful, even the most passionate brussels naysayers will fall in love with them.  Rice Cake:  The best.thing.EVER.  I don't know WHAT this is or HOW it's made, but I would eat these amaze-balls balls any day of the week.  They defy description, so I kindly ask you to take my word for it.  The moral of this visit was, I don't know how these dishes are prepared, nor do I know the majority of what they contain.  Regardless, each of them was a culinary masterpiece fit for any Pittsburgh palate, if you dare."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was eclectic and interesting to look at. The food was very good. Very much enjoyed the cauliflower. The drinks were strong. I don't mind strong drinks but my date didn't care for his. My only complaint was that our table was under the A/C vent so it was cold. I had to keep my coat on the entire time. Food was good though so we would go back."}
{"text":"We finally made it to Butcher and the Rye for my daughter's birthday. Even after being open for awhile, it is necessary to make reservations, at least on the weekend. We took a 5PM seating  time to leave plenty of time before a show. There was a line out the entrance before the restaurant even opened at 5. Once the doors opened, patrons were seated quickly and our waitress was available almost immediately. I tried the Brussel sprouts (small plate) and the pork wing. The pork wing is not large but is very rich. I ended up sharing. The portion of brussel sprouts was also large enough to share. The food is delicious but the price range makes this a special occasion place."}
{"text":"This is a really popular restaurant, with a diverse menu and a two-fisted cooking style.  This style works well with pub favorites and appetizers, like the excellent rabbit rillettes (not enough toast) and the grilled radicchio salad (small).  The main plates lacked finesse and were very heavy.  Yes, the scallops were grilled perfectly, but the accompanying \"crab risotto\" was a mushy mess of over-cheesed rice that did not allow the crab to emerge.  Same with the chicken dish: the meat part was very good, the mushroom duxelles tasty but way too heavy. Because we still had that great rillettes dish, we ordered the sourdough bread (baked in house), it was ok but nothing particular. The beer list was not very distinguished (no local beers) but a few good US breweries were listed (not on tap). The service was very good, given the crowds.  A solid 3.5 restaurant food-wise."}
{"text":"Very good and interesting place.  The menu is right-sized, with a handful of starters, salads, small plates, and large plates.  Here's what I really liked:  - Kale Caesar Salad - the kale is slightly wilted, as it should be, so it is not too tough for this type of salad.  They must make their own dressing; it was excellent, and the giant croutons were great, too.  - Mac & Cheese Small Plate - OMG, you've got to get this.  It's just enough to share with a table of four.  There is nothing overtly unusual about this rendition of the classic, but it is just excellent.  - Wagyu Flank Steak - So flavorful (as flank steak should be), and somehow not tough like a flank usually is if it is not marinated, and this did not taste marinated.  The mix of veggies under the steak were really flavorful and added to the dish (little potatoes, green peppers, maybe some onions, some kind of sauce that was the consistency of gravy, but a bit sour, almost like mustard - whatever it was, it worked).  - The Setting - The room we were in (pretty much straight back and to the right of the hostess stand) was small and intimate, but had a very high ceiling.  There is rough-hewn wooden planks on one or two walls, and very loungey, dark, velvet wallpaper on the back wall.  The chandelier is made of one hundred deer antlers.  - Service - Just right, not pretentious, just helpful, fairly attentive, and knowledgeable.  I always like it when the server is genuinely enthused about the items on the menu.  So this place lives up to the hype, but in a lower-key way than I expected, which is good with me."}
{"text":"This is hands down one of the best restaurants downtown.  We had been meaning to come here for many months but we could never get a reservation.  We finally got one and it was worth the wait. Starting from the ambiance is great! Both for a casual dinner (e.g., around the bar area) but also for a romantic date or even a family gathering.  The food selection is great and the cocktail menu has a wide variety! The service is also extremely fast and helpful.  I cannot wait to go back and try more of their stuff.  Definitely worth making reservation even if it is 2 months later :)"}
{"text":"My #1 Pittsburgh Restaurant Week choice was here.  So weeks in advance I booked a reservation for Wednesday.  This was the only day available that I could get a reservation at a normal dinner hour time.  I have tried in the past to make reservations here and because I am not into eating dinner at 11:45 pm, I have been unsuccessful.  But here we were, and I was so excited to finally try B&R especially during Restaurant week.  For starters we were seated pretty promptly upstairs in a long communal type of table.  Though the tables themselves were separated (as they had to be in order to get in and out) you could easily reach to your left or right and hold the stranger sitting next to you.  It also induced an awkward situation that the waiter had  to talk to the back of my husband's head all night unless he wanted to do a 180 to speak at him directly.  The place was also very dark, which led to an unfortunate incident I shall unveil at the proper time.  Not initimatly dark, but more like bedtime dark with flickering candles.    So to the food, again extremely excited, and again looked online at their Restaurant week menu and was eager to try the menu, but alas without making it known on Restaurant week's website, the chef decided to change the menu daily.  I can't remember what was on the website but I recall being disappointed because I really wanted to try it.  Due to the new findings the hubs ordered off the regular menu.  He went with the WAGYU FLANK STEAK prepared medium.  I stuck to the altered restaurant week menu that had four courses.  1)corn fritters with an aoli 2) a pea soup with half a toasted cheese sammie 3) A seafood pasta dish 4) A flaky cream pastry with lemon, berries and a chocolate sauce.  I also ordered a couple overpriced Manhattans.  The food came at a good pace.  The corn fritters were rather good but were sitting in a vessel on top of the sauce making it difficult to dip them individually (had to ask for some extra on the side).  Next the pea soup and cheese sandwich.  This was definitely the best thing I had that evening.  The pea soup was delightful.  The gourmet grilled cheese great flavor and worked well together with the creamy pea soup.  I will say from here my dining experience started to plummet.  Next my seafood pasta came out along with the wagyu for my husband.  So remember how it was really dark in there?  The dish was prepared with a darker noodle and my first bit was full of shrimp and prawn shells.  They left all the shells on in this dark place hidden in this dark dish.  I spent the rest of the time picking shells out of my teeth and feeling the pain of regret.  At one point I pulled a huge prawn whisker from my mouth and said that's it I can't eat this anymore.  Funny thing, my very close neighbor, who I could hear easily, flagged down the waiter and began to tell him how much she disliked her meal and I quote \"this tastes like a fishes ass.\"  Sadly I looked down and we were eating the same thing.  To add to the disappointment my husband's wagyu was tough.  I mean a $30.00 steak should melt in your mouth and it was so tough and chewy, just not a choice cut whatsoever.    The desert was average to me, I am not a big sweets fan.  I split this with my husband who adamantly believes fruit doesn't belong in deserts unless it's apple pie. But nevertheless helped me eat it.  I would try B&R again, but it's not at the top of my list since there are many other good places that you don't have to book a month in advance to visit ."}
{"text":"I love ambience of this restaurant, the bar has a great selection and great bartenders. Food is great, sometimes hard to get reservations."}
{"text":"A+ .. Great great craft cocktails and great bites! Came with co workers and sat outside on a Friday afternoon. We had a few drinks and they were all amazing. I honestly have no idea what was in them but they were all great!  We had a very nice friendly server who gave us great prompt service. She had good recommendations and was very helpful.  We ordered the pork belly on kimchi and if you like pork I would say def gotta try this! I usually don't like kimchi but I thought it was actually really good. We also got the Brussels sprouts and everybody loved them but I'm not a huge fan of brussel  sprouts. We also ordered the Mac a cheese and its was soooo creamy and yummy. Not too heavy and had a nice crunch on top. I didn't think Pittsburgh would have anything cool like this.. I really enjoyed this place and their new sister store next door, tako. I would come back to both!"}
{"text":"SUPER delicious.  The blue crab risotto is life changing.  Our server was Melanie and she was the best!  Very knowledgeable and helpful.  The drinks were great, ambiance fabulous and decor amazing.  Really cool place - loved it!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious! They added a new twist and flavor to ingredients I already love. We went on a Saturday night and sat at the bar for hours. The atmosphere and music is fun and modern. The Wall of Bourban is great especially when they climb the ladder to go up on the shelves."}
{"text":"I was a bit nervous after our recent and disappointing experience at their sister establishment Meat & Potatos; however our experience prior to the Star Wars symphony performance was absolutley delightful! The restaurant seated us immediately upon checking in for our reservation and we received top notch service in spite of many holiday parties and overall full house of diners that evening. The restaurant itself was decorated whimsically and approiately for the seaon and I loved the various levels of dining and bar areas.  Our drink varied, but the Bowtie was a favorite. The appetizers were all tasty. My personal favorite was the brussel sprouts, contrary to my hubby and son's review of sprouts in general...haha. They enjoyed the pig wing and potato and leek soup which were both quite good too.  For our entrees, we were all pleased with our selections. They were as ordered: SEARED SCALLOPS $26  blue crab risotto / asparagus / chanterelles / capers Amazing!!! Cooked to perfection! Best Risotto I have had in a while!  CASSOULET $30 duck confit / boudin noir / pork belly / 5 minute egg / cannellini beans / brown butter crumbs / pickled orange / mustard Cooked well with a variety of flavors in this dish. Duck was not greasy, but flavorful and boudin was delish!  DIRTY PASTA $18 ground duck / strozzapretti / sage / brandy / pecorino romano Wonderful pasta dish! Ground duck and seasonings made this a must order for pasta lovers.  The restaurant could not have been more convenient to Heinz Hall located directly across the street. We will absolutely dine here again in the future and recommend it to our friends for sure. FINALLY a restaurant downtown I can put on my \"go to\" list!"}
{"text":"I started to give 4 stars because my salad came out with my meal, but my rabbit paparadelle was so amazing they need the full five! I'm a huge fan of Meat and Potatoes,  now I have options!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! First time here and the atmosphere is top of the tops along with the food and service. There is nothing left out when visiting. Made an 8:30 reservation and arrived about 8:05, checked in and sat at the bar cause our table wasn't ready of course cause we were so early. Within seconds of ordering our drink and having it given to us....my phone buzzed cause they text me that we were all set! I can not tell you how amazing our experience was but it was great! Fillet-Die for! Roasted chicken-BAM, spot on! They have every seating arrangement you could want from picnic style to cozy couch seating, I asked for couch seating and was perfect. TEN stars if I could! I even asked the server if she needed the table cause we were there till closing and she was so nice that she didn't even bat an eye with responding with, \"NO! You guys look like your having a wonderful time, I'm not gonna mess that up.\" Thanks again and I'll be back 100% next time I'm in town from Florida."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants I have been to in Pittsburgh to date. Fantastic whiskey selection and service equally as good. Ordered the lamb neck and my boyfriend got he scallop risotto. Great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Great food and cocktails. The restaurant can get very crowded so reservation is highly recommended."}
{"text":"I had heard so many great things about this restaurant and therefore decided try during a business trip to Pittsburgh.  The space is very eclectic, but cool.  I was seated upstairs which offered a nice view of the entire restaurant.  I proceeded to order the foccacia bread, the infamous brussel sprouts and mac n' cheese.   The bread arrived first, in loaf form, not what I was expecting, with 3 dips, that didn't really excite me.  The bread was topped with a multitude herbs and it was very,very greasy on the bottom.....I coudn't eat much of it.   The brussel sprouts arrived next.   I LOVE brussel sprouts, but these just didn't do it for me.  The fried sprouts were buried in a cheesy, greasy, vinegary mass.   I could barely taste/find the sprouts.....I didn't finish them.   Last but not least, the mac n' cheese.  The portion was generous, and nicely flavored but I would have preferred it baked versus just heated on the stovetop.   It was just too soupy for me and once again, I couldn't finish it.   I declined dessert, fearing another disappointment.   This place just didn't do it for me, but I can see where other would like it.  The atmosphere is welcoming and the ingredients are fresh and well selected."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing and the decorations are very quirky. They have quite the extensive cocktail list to fit all palates; I prefer my cocktails a little bitter/smokey and the Apple Cort his the spot). My husband and I enjoyed our first meal in Pittsburgh at Butcher and Rye and it exceeded our expectations.  The bone marrow jelly and fried octopus are absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Really great addition to the Cultural District.  The food is very good, the service is excellent, and they offer extended hours that the kitchen is open.  I tried their French Onion Soup, which was brand new on the menu.  It was not a traditional style French Onion Soup, the broth was much meatier, less thin.  It was a creative take on a classic dish, and the chef definitely made it work.   Great atmosphere. Even though the restaurant was packed, the seating is on different levels, so it feels less crowded to me."}
{"text":"It was a good experience. The food and service are great. I just think is very expensive."}
{"text":"Home run!  This place gets the coveted 5th star!  The ambience once \"in the belly\" of the place makes you feel you're in a cross between an old time restaurant and a place right off the hunting preserve.  All done is a decor that just works very well.    The spirits are plentiful as the bar serves up some fantastic whiskey and bourbon cocktails, along with many of the traditional drinks served at most places.   The food...fabulous!  Our table ate about a half dozen of the small plates and loved every one...pig candy, bone marrow, charcuterie, beef tartare, brussels sprouts...any place that makes brussels sprouts taste incredible is a winner!  And then dinner...from the large plates.  Two hanger steaks, scallops, and rabbit...all incredible, all shared around the table because it was just that good.   It's simple.  Plan ahead.  Make the reservation.  Get to this place for dinner as soon as you can!  This is a top 5 in the Burgh for sure!"}
{"text":"Disappointed.   I gave this joint two shots...two...  Three things I love - going to restaurants, trying new things, and my birthday. So when planning my birthday dinner and discovering that this place was opening that weekend, I thought, perfect - three of my favorite things!  Now, mind you, this is probably two weeks out from my birthday dinner. So i find the number, give them a call, and I reach a recording where I was unable to leave a message. Fine. So I call Meat and Potatoes, their sister restaurant, and I speak with the hostess there who tells me that Butcher and the Rye isn't taking reservations for the first two weeks that they are open. Fine. So I contact my dinner guests, they are fine with winging it without a reservation. We figured we'd go on the early side as we anticipate a bit of a wait.   We arrive at 7:30 on the first Saturday they are open, get to the host stand, and they asked us if we had a reservation. Excuse me? \"I was told you weren't taking reservations for the first two weeks.\" Response: \"Well, on Tuesday of this week we got so many requests for reservations we had to start taking them.\" Really? \"We can have a table for you at 1045.\" Again, really?   So we decided to have a drink there and call some other places to get a table for dinner. We sat at the bar upstairs, while three or four tables behind us were empty with reservation signs on them. There were only two small groups of people at the bar including us, and I had to flag one of the two bartenders down to get their attention to my empty drink that had been sitting on the bar for at least five minutes.   We were there for about 45 minutes, and when we left there was still one open table that could have seated us. Now, having worked at restaurants for most of my late teens and early twenties I understand that you have to make room for reservations, but restaurants should also know how to turn tables quickly to accommodate walk ins (there were only three of us!).   Long story short, I decided to chalk it up to management needing to fine tune some things after the first weekend. Needing a place for dinner for the Friday after Thanksgiving, I decided to give them another shot. I made a reservation for eight, tried to bump it up to nine, but they said the most people they could accommodate at one table was eight. Fine.  When we got there, they asked us if we had reservation before we even entered the door. Yes. Then we got to the host stand - they asked us again if we had a reservation.  Yes, but it's down to seven - someone bailed last minute. The hostess did a bit of scurrying, asking probably a manger if we could still have the table they had for us with only seven. That person said yes. Then they said that two guests had arrived and were at the bar. We go see them, and our two guests were the ones that said our table was ready, the hostess didn't let us know even though we had walked right by the room with our table.    They had us in the front room with the big picnic table and the floor to ceiling window. The table and room could have comfortably accommodated ten people, but my request for nine was denied. And it was freezing. I couldn't take my coat off the entire dinner. Pretty dismal.  The food was...meh. We ordered lots of apps to share and it was quite comical because one person did the ordering, and all the food was served to her, despite it being quite obvious that all these dishes had been ordered was for the table and not just for her. Drinks took awhile to come, but the servers and food runners were very nice...so they had that going for them...  Needless to say, disappointed. Great atmosphere, cool because it's new, but probably wouldn't hit it up as dinner spot again any time soon."}
{"text":"By far one of the best meals I have had. If I wasn't with coworkers I would have licked my plates clean, unfortunately I had to leave a little of my sauces on the plate. The small plates menu here has many options. We couldn't decided so ended up ordering three. Siracha spiced roasted shishito peppers, buttery crisp brussel sprouts with dill and parmesan and roasted cauliflower with farro and Harissa yogurt.  The peppers had just the right char to it and just the right amount of spice.  The miso salt added just the right punch to the dish.  If you have not tried dill with brussel sprouts then I highly recommend it. It changes the whole dish somehow the lemony anise flavor along with Parmesan works really well. After eating the farro here I am going to start mixing yogurt with Harissa sauce and using it to dress my grains. The tang from the yogurt hits you just as the spice from Harissa attacks. It's like a war of spices in your mouth and believe me a very happy war. For my entree I had roasted chicken with shiitake and roasted grapes. The chicken was juicy, when eaten with shiitake and grapes the sweet salty and briny flavors worked well together.  Finished off with lemon meringue pie with matcha ice cream, hibiscus dust and fruit caviar. To explain how this tasted would make me want to fly there right now. Highly recommended if you are in the Pittsburg area. I did think about stealing one of their aprons while there but I decided I would want to come back to this restaurant and be banned. Thank you for such a memorable dinner!"}
{"text":"So I have been here a few times. I came craving the sundae. For those who have had this, it is heaven. A carrot cake, coconut ice cream perfection. Disappointment 1- it is no longer on the menus. I had their pasta special, which consisted of leeks, roe, pig trotter, and general pasta goodness. I decided to try the new S'more. It arrived and disappointment 2- no element was warm. This was a deconstructed s'more. Homemade marshmallow, brown butter ice cream (a la fried ice cream), a chocolate ganache-type creation, and chocolate graham cracker. It looked ok. Then I tasted. OMG!  Dessert heaven. All disappointment washed away, carrot cake who?!  If you like s'mores, this will not disappoint. This was sweet, but the brown butter and graham elements tone it down. If I wouldn't have looked insane I would have ordered two. I will go back for this alone."}
{"text":"Went here for date night on a Friday, it was a long expected wait but I am nothing less than impressed with this restaurant. The ambiance, atmosphere, and staff were all absolutely great!  I will def make a reservation the next time I am heading here."}
{"text":"Made reservations in advance and hubs and I were really looking forward to our night out here. The decor and overall atmosphere here are really great, and the whiskey bar is awesome.   Service was excellent, but sadly we were not wowed by the food. We went with the Brussels and Sunday Gravy for apps - both were really good and the Sunday Gravy had an amazing flavor from the lamb neck - super tasty and probably the best thing we ate that night. I went with the wagyu burger and hubs went with the steak dish, which was sadly a little disappointing. The meat was not very flavorful at all, but the accompanying carrot wellington was delish. My burger was good, but not great - it was hot and juicy and well cooked. There was a lot of bread more than burger and it was just OK in flavor. I was really expecting to be wow-ed by it, but sadly was let down a bit.   I would definitely like to give this place a second go round - the Dirty Pasta looked amazing and I like that they change their menu around. It is absolutely worth another try and is a really fun spot in the city."}
{"text":"After falling in love with Meat & Potatoes, I felt it was only right to give this chef another chance to wow and impress.  After anxiously awaiting our reservation for upwards of 2 months, the night finally came and I have to say it was well worth the wait and even lived up to the hype.  The restaurant is gorgeous, very gamie, outdoorsy feel to mixed with a almost fine dining decor.   For appetizers we tried the Dry Aged Tartar, this was the best variety of this dish I have truthfully ever come across.  Delightful large pieces of fine quality beef, encrusted with parmesan, black garlic aoli and the best part truffled eggs.  Put it all together on a piece of the texas style toast served with it and you have a melting genius combination that will leave you salvating.  We also really enjoyed their version of Mac & Cheese, the goat cheese was the real standout here.  A sharp variation, creamy and surprisingly complex. For Entrees we tried the Wagyu Flank Steak and Seared Scallops.  I have to admit I am no scallop fan but found this dish to be the better of the two, they were absolutely perfectly prepared with a fantastic crunch to top them off. The Flank Steak was very good but I did feel like I could of picked a better Entree to represent the restaurants diversity and expertise, I just think I picked the wrong dish, nothing more.  I was satisfied but not wowed by this steak, I dont really understand the whole Wagyu craze anyway.I would recommend this restaurant to anybody that liked meat and potatoes and likes to stay some what in American Comfort Food.  However this menu is a bit more exotic than M&P.  Service was excellent and knowledgeable as well."}
{"text":"I basically see this place as the little brother to Meat and Potatoes.  Great food, worth a try for sure.  Only been once, and I remember that the rabbit dish my date got was delicious."}
{"text":"Came here with colleagues for drinks and apps. First and foremost, the interior is perfect. Reminds me of old school western tavern movie sets we used during film school. Very intimate but also caters to festive groupings. This group does ambience just right (enter , Tako and M&P).  If ever I want old school Pittsburgh blended with a touch of modern flare, Butcher and M&P will always be my first choices.   Let's start with the Nauti-Mule. As I read the description not only was I intrigued but I also started asking people for Prilosec as the jalapeno was a bit of a curve ball for me - I was dead wrong. This was a delicious drink and kudos to those who tend bar at Butcher.  Being a Bond fan one can never overlook a drink appropriately named Vesper and being an avoid taster and lover of apple brandy, the Jack Rose was spot on.  Let's talk grub. We kept it to appetizers which was great as we had dinner plans later that evening. If anyone reading this has ever been to Nashville or Charleston, legendary Chef Sean Brock has an incredible restaurant in both locations called Husk. This is by far one of my favorite restaurants in the US. He, too, at one point had a dish similar to the Candied Pig and Cauliflower. I'm going to give it to Butcher when I say both were on par with what I had at Husk! Albeit bacon, I'm not even a pork fan (sue me).  Anyhow, these were my orders followed by the Mac N Cheese (really hard to F this up but they did do it great justice with the taleggio adding a bit of a fruity tang to it which I LOVE.   Overall, great atmosphere, great flavors, and a subtly festive environment nestled within a romantically rustic ambience.   You can't go wrong.  Highly recommended. Lives up to the hype."}
{"text":"The cheese and charcuterie starter were good. Not great but some interesting flavors to try.  The drinks were great.  Main dish I had the lobster and pork sugo. The noodles were amazing but there was something so hard in the dish it was hard to eat and was the most salty dish of have ever eaten. Overall disappointed but a good experience"}
{"text":"We went here this past Saturday night around 10:30pm.  While it was busy, we were still able to find seats along the wall across from the bar.  The decor in this place is nothing short of amazing.  It reminds me a lot of a speakeasy in NYC called \"Please Don't Tell.\" No detail was left untouched.    We ordered the Rye whiskey flight, a Moscow Mule and decided to snack on the Dirty Pasta.  Our drinks were served quickly and the food followed shortly after.  The whiskey flight was enjoyable, our bartender brought the three tasting glasses over to us and explained each one, recommending order in which we should drink them.  The Moscow Mule was well done, not the best in the city in my opinion (hop on over to Acacia for that one), but delicious nonetheless.    Now, on to the Dirty Pasta. Oh. My. God.  Quite possibly one of the best dishes I've ever tasted.  Everything about it was perfect.  My only complaint would be that we ran out of noodles before everything else on the plate, but the ground duck/sage blend was too god to NOT eat by itself on a fork.  All in all, a wonderful evening and I highly recommend this for a date night, girls night, or pre/post theater-show drinks.  I will definitely be back very, very soon!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delish. The duck liver pate is to die for. Beef tartare was great as well. The dirty pasta was amazing (maybe too oily) and the scallops were great as well. Pound lemon cake came with interesting toppings. Wine selection not the best and a little overpriced but overall it's a place to dine in while in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"The food and drinks were great, but the bathroom situation is horrible -- at least in the women's bathroom.  The \"stalls\" are only about waist-high and thus, are pointless -- as soon as you step in the main door, you can see everything that is happening in any of the \"stalls.\"  When the door is open, guys going into the men's room can probably see everything, too.  Obviously, none of the women in the restaurant were very excited about this, so there was a long line for the single-use accessible bathroom.  I would only go if I had a friend to come in with me and guard the door.  This is the WORST idea ever -- its one thing to go to the bathroom in the open when you're camping and eating spam, but its another thing altogether when you're paying for $12 cocktails.  NOT OK."}
{"text":"This was an interesting place. Expensive cocktails and really, only tapas sized dishes.  Go with a group to sample a spoonful of different things.  Great dark atmosphere. Will go back."}
{"text":"Interesting food, unique atmosphere. Anyone who is squeamish about being surrounded by stuffed wild animal heads ( and in the case of the bear, the entire animal) will not be happy here. Pate was quite good as were all the dishes that we sampled. The building could benefit from some better circulation & improved A/C as it was a bit hot & stuffy on the top floor."}
{"text":"8 of us went here last night and I have to say, I don't know what these other yelpers are complaining about (except the bathrooms which I will get to later) - it is awesome!  Pricey, yes, but awesome.   First off, the decor.  When you walk in, you just know that the place is going to be good.  The bourbon bar downstairs is epic.  It has a ladder to reach the top bottles like you see in a library, very cool.  We ended up sitting upstairs which was part library, part taxidermy museum.  So long as you won't be offended sitting under a deer head (and if you are, this is not the place for you), the decor works with what they are trying to pull off her.    Second, the drinks.  Most of us ordered some bourbon drink, whether mixed or straight.  While I do think that $20 bucks for 2 ounces is a bit excessive, I stuck to the mixed drinks.  I had the Pittsburgh Smash - fruit, whiskey, blackberry goodness and the Whiskey Daisy - which I just loved saying and the flavor matched up to the adorable name.  My husband got beer and was really pleased with the selection except the special Church Brew Works light beer which was too bubbly, almost like the fermentation was off.   Third, the food!  Oh, the food.  We split things, we hoarded things for ourselves, it was all awesome.  J and I split the camembert which was definitely the low-point of the night for me.  I make baked brie all the time for special events and I have to say that mine is better.  Beyond, that, I can't even comprehend how they made some of these dishes.  Each was better than the one before it.  So in order of awesomeness, with the last dish being the most awesome: Baked camembert  Baked apple Betty - Not enough ice cream for one, too much sauce for another.  It was basically like a apple crisp that wasn't crispy enough.  Fried brussels - these are amazing.  These make people that hate brussels say, oh, really, these are brussel sprouts?  Yes, my friend, yes, they are.   Rice cakes - I know, I thought the same thing.  Dry, brittle, diet food in a place like this?  But no.  Like other reviewers have mentioned, these are pillows of rice goodness.  Covered in a spicy ssauce that has more of a kick at the end, these astound me.  Seriously.   Fish platter special - oysters, smoked mussels, shrimps with the heads on, whitefish salad, gigantic crab legs.  It was a bit pricey -$49 bucks - but the seafood was pretty out of this world fresh and delicious.  I loved the smoked mussels cause they are always delicious and the shrimp were mammoth.   Pig candy - Pork belly in a spicy, sweet sauce.  It was amazing.  I think my husband wanted to divorce me and marry it.  It's that good.   Fourth, the bathrooms.  This is why they don't get 5 stars.  When asked about why the bathrooms are so freaking weird, the waitress told us that it's a different kind of place and they are trying to do something different.  There is good different and bad different and this is definitely bad different.  I had read the reviews, so I knew what to expect, but it is even weirder in person.  The stalls only go up to right above your waist and are huge, so you can totally, if you are into that sort of thing, check out the person with you using the bathroom.  There are only two stalls, so I am not sure what you do if you are the third person waiting.  Stare at the ceiling?  There is a lock on the door to completely cut out anyone from entering while you are in there, but these seems like a lawsuit waiting to happen.  Seriously."}
{"text":"In terms of the cool factor Butcher and the Rye certainly has \"it\". They did an amazing job with the interior design of this restaurant; it seems like a never ending labyrinth of cool things stashed everywhere. Unfortunately the high cool factor does not outweigh the \"just fine\" food.   I tried 4 dishes, the cauliflower, their take on Banh Mi, bucheron (a cheese and beets dish), and one of the nightly specials, a veal and polenta dish. The winner of the 4 was the cauliflower dish, it was an awesome combination of textures, saltiness, creaminess, freshness. This dish was the winner of the night. All other were just OK. Their play on the Banh Mi is a pork terrine with Bahn Mi flavors. Until I went back and read the description I never would have known that this was supposed to resemble a Banh Mi. The bucheron was fine, and the veal and polenta dish tasted just like a decent pot roast. There just wasn't anything about the food that makes me want to rush back here.  I'm not writing Bucher and the Rye off just yet, I just wished it lived up a little closer to my expectations."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to grab a cocktail with friends or on a date!!  I love the bar tenders and have always had a great experience!! Cecil is the best!!!  What awesome decor as well!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place. It has a real cool interior, Inviting atmosphere, friendly waiters, great drinks and good food. It was buzzing with people when we arrived, so we got a few drinks and appetizers while waiting for a seat outdoors. The waitress quickly took care of us and everyone was happy with their drinks. The brussels sprouts and Sunday gravy were really good and because we were four sharing, they didn't fill us up too much. As main I had the rabbit with buttermilk dumplings. Although overall tasty, it was a bit too peppery and I felt there too little meat in the  creamy sauce. The others enjoyed the filet which was perfectly cooked to their liking and a plate of trout."}
{"text":"Food that non-foodies would recognize in theory but elevated to a different class. I don't tend to love a busy plate, but every speck and smear had a purpose that made for a very pleasing build of flavors.  The tartare is not to be missed and the cocktails are well made. Our server, James, was sweet and has a keen interest in food. The only hiccup was with the meal progression as a salad and beer were slow to appear at our table...but proper meal progression seems to be elusive at many of restaurants we visit these days. The food was very well done, however, and even though we aren't die hard carnivores, butcher and the rye is a restaurant that it worth visiting!"}
{"text":"Went here for an anniversary dinner.  Food was inventive and delicious!  Had the tasting 3 course menu paired with cocktails.  I know this option was only available for Pittsburgh Restaurant Week but I hope the chef offers it again.  Top notch food and service!"}
{"text":"Went here for restaurant week and was very disappointed.  The food was ok but nothing great.  The table was small.  The service was good.  However it was very noisy.  Having read the reviews and heard the buzz I expected more."}
{"text":"Heard all the hype and had to check it out for myself.  I am glad I did.  We showed up a little early and had drinks at the bar - both delicious.  We were sat upstairs at a lovely table overlooking the dining below and we had a great view of the entire place.  Our server, Sam, did a great job getting us hooked up.  Our meal was delicious!  We started with both pig appetizers, because pig.  We were not disappointed.  I could have eaten 10 plates of just those.   We didn't.  We each had a salad, which was good, not amazing but good (beet salad for me).  We shared the dirty pasta and I was glad I had read on here that the portion size was huge, because 2 plates of that would have killed us.  We would have died delicious deaths, but would have missed out on dessert.  The real star was the pasta, but we weren't sad by any of it.  Food and service were great.  We will definitely try this place out again!"}
{"text":"Traveling to Pittsburgh to check it out for a fun weekend we had dinner in this wonderful restaurant.  We headed upstairs to the bar and ordered salad, meat dishes, veggie plates, and all were good.  A very pretty place with a smooth appeal in decor.  Nice feel to the place and not that noisy that we could talk at a normal level.  If you like small plates and a variety of tastes I would highly recommend this well done treat.  I found the prices very reasonable for the caliber of food."}
{"text":"(This review is only for the drinks.)  Butcher and the Rye is going into my top 5 favorite places to drink in Pittsburgh. The bartender that we talked to definitely knew what he was doing. He's the kind of bartender that properly chills your glass and puts a lot of love into shaking up your cocktail. I got the Hazel-Rah and Thorny Devil and they were both delicious. Hazel-Rah was like taking a quick tropical vacation. My friend wanted a drink with a smokey Scotch and the bartender made something off the menu that was quite fantastic.  They also had some lovely decor. Their drink shelves are impressive - backlit and brimming with exotic concoctions. They have a ladder to get to the top shelves, which gives you an idea of how many bottles they have.   As some have mentioned, the women's bathroom is a bit odd. The stalls are really low, so you can see into them. I ended up having a good laugh with a stranger in the bathrooms though because we both felt so ridiculous sharing such an intimate moment.   I've heard great things about the food, so making plans to go back!"}
{"text":"Great mussels and brussel sprouts. Nice, dim lighting. Decor a little heavy on the taxidermy, but the decorator kept to her concept and constructed a coherent atmosphere."}
{"text":"Amazing! Had the scallops, focaccia bread which was to die for, the Brussel sprouts are crazy good!! Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I've been dying to get to B&tR for a few years now, so when two of my best friends plotted to take me out for a night on the town starting with dinner here, I was thrilled.  Listen, if you don't like low lights, Prohibition-era cocktails, skinny jeans, moustaches, art deco mixed with rustic hunting lodge chic, and questionable restroom signage, Butcher and the Rye is NOT for you.  It's very much a hipster new American restaurant, it knows it, and I love it for that.  My friends both got a potato soup and big boards of bread and butter, while I dove into some scallops on a bed of blue crab risotto and asparagus with an Old Fashioned to wash it down.  I was transported to my happy place.  Service was excellent as well.  I was well pleased with my experience; I will be back someday."}
{"text":"We went to Butcher and the Rye for my Mom and Dad's 55th wedding anniversary.  Boy, we were surprised - in a good way!  Josh was our server.  We sat at a huge table made for 8 (there were 5 of us) right beside big garage doors that opened to the outside.  It was a perfect day in Pittsburgh for sitting outside.  We ordered the bread with dips for $5.  SOOOOO worth it.  We loved the hummus, tappanade (sp?), and ricotta spreads.  We shared salads.  I didn't LOVE my ceasar but my mom got the salad that was in season and her and my daughter just gobbled it up.  I ordered the Wagyu Flank Steak.  It was delicious.  My mom and daughter got the scallops.  I would get them the next time.  Melt in your mouth GOOD.  My dad got the chicken and he's pretty picky.  He really liked it.  And my friend got the sea bass.  Just excellent.    We all tasted each others dinner and there was not one bad meal.  We then shared a Smore dessert.  It was nice.  Mom and I had a glass of champagne.  Our whole order came to about $220.  Then I had to tip.  And actually, for the quality of the food, I thought it was quite reasonable.  We were so impressed that me and my two girls went back two nights later before seeing The Wedding Singer at the Benedum.  This time my daughter ordered the Dirty Pasta.  She didn't love it and ate my scallops.  Darn her.  But I loved it.  Rich, but delightful.  We also got the Fried Brussel Sprouts.  I hate brussels.  But my daughter loves them. Well, i will tell you....BAM....SOOO GOOD.  Just get them.  Trust me.  So, so good.  Overall, go to this place.  You will NOT be disappointed."}
{"text":"WOW!  This place was amazing!  We sat outside..a little cramped but we made it work.  What we lacked in space...they more than made up in flavor and friendly service!! It was an exceptional experience!  We were a group of 4 just hanging out in the city, we decided to order most of the small plates and share.....it was fantastic!  Each plate came out just as we finished the last one...PERFECT!!  Everything we ate was wonderful!  So much pride in preparing each dish!  We LOVED it!!!  The Brussels sprouts were the table favorite!!  They were INCREDIBLE!!!!!!  Since we sat outside, I couldn't really tell you about the decor..We did dodge the crowd to make it to the bathrooms....and what an eye opener that was!!  It ridiculous!!  Obviously designed by a man.....You definitely have to check it out for yourself!   But, it will make you giggle and makes for colorful dinner conversation...whatever, I'm there for the food..which was AMAZING!!!!"}
{"text":"Spectacular! I would come to Pittsburgh just for this restaurant. The food is presented beautifully, the menu is inventive, eclectic crowd (it is crowded), I felt like the hostess and waiters were my friends, ambiance was soothing and the food, oh my goodness, the food! You want to eat and just order a little of everything just so you can try everything. The decor is just perfect and I loved all of the little touches. With some drinks and wine you can spend a little more but it is worth every cent and you can write a little note in the leather bound book before you leave...nice touch. My new fave!"}
{"text":"Fabulous food and great service , the halibut was amazing. Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh !"}
{"text":"A coveted five star review. I'm not sure where to start but this place is extremely eclectic in it's decoration and menu. We arrived at 5 PM and there was already a line. They have a bone marrow appetizer which was delicious. Also the beet salad appetizer was amazing. One of their specialties is a dirty pasta with dark, and another special rabbit kielbasa with a pirogi and pork belly. Please filled up quickly and I can't say enough about the unusual decor. There were animal heads mounted on the wall along with unusual wallpaper and lighting. The food was divine and everyone enjoyed themselves thoroughly. They have a tremendous whiskey menu and it is stacked to the roof at their bar which the access with a rolling ladder such as in a library. If I lived in Pittsburgh I would be a regular here. However, my first experience was so great that I may just have to plan another trip to Pittsburgh in the future so I may return."}
{"text":"While I didn't get to taste the food here, I did 'sample' some bourbon. Wow! The list is tremendous and the decor is beautiful. Looking forward to checking out the food next time. Very cool spot not to miss while in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Can't wait to go back.   We had a lovely meal here. Headed over after a Pirates game and wasn't sure we'd get in. The place was still packed at almost 10pm on a Wednesday. Host was very helpful finding us a table.   Everything we are was awesome. Creamy yellow tomato gazpacho with blue crab. Kale Caesar salad with salty anchovy garlic toast. Fresh burrata with sweet and tart plums. Lamb neck Sunday sauce that only needed more bread to get every last drop. And the best pork belly I've ever had - pork candy. A must try for everyone!!  Service was perfect. And headed to the bar after dinner for whiskey flights in front of a two story high wall of whiskey.   Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"My experience was terrific I would have given them five stars but the food was forgettable. I had the Mac and Cheese and it was bland at best. The drinks were fantastic and the service was excellent..."}
{"text":"***Horrifying customer service experience*** I'm a huge Meat and Potatoes, Tako and Butcher and the Rye customer, so I must warn you this will be unfiltered. I go to Meat and Potatoes more that I go to see my family (and they live nearby), and this was the absolute worst display of customer service that I have ever seen.  We booked a reservation for ten people over a month ago, for 9:45 PM, to celebrate a huge achievement for my sister. We wanted to make sure that we didn't lose our spot and decided to arrive at 9:30. 9:45 rolls around and the horrible hosts let time pass without giving TEN of us an update. Instead 9:55, no update. The two hosts were absolutely terrible, made zero effort to talk to us at all about the delay or what would happen next. We had to proactively ask how long the delay would be. We were especially ready to eat since we had an 8 year old girl with us, who had not eaten dinner due to the graduation. The two hosts said well I guess we can look at the table upstairs but they are about to start dessert and we don't ask people to leave. Now it's after 10:00 and nothing has been said to a party of TEN, completely dressed up. So I started making calls to nearby restaurants to see who could accommodate our party. I guess they are too fancy to care about ten people, but I know other businesses/servers would kill to wait on a group that is celebrating.  Luckily, Six Penn Kitchen stepped up and we left immediately.   I get that this restaurant doesn't have to have good customer service, because customers pour into these restaurants. But this is beyond disappointing and frustrating. As a downtowner, I'm here to tell you that there are restaurants down here that want and deserve your business. I'll take a good experience at restaurant that isn't well known, over a bad experience that disrespects their customers' time."}
{"text":"Came here for a midweek date night! The reservation process online was super easy and parking was accessible nearby (we couldn't find street parking, but parking at many of the garages downtown is $4 in the evenings). We started off with a few drinks - the Black Dahlia and the Punch. The Black Dahlia was well made and had some interesting ingredients (including activated charcoal & egg white), so I found it a pretty enjoyable experience. The Punch had a really nice grapefruit flavor and was easy to drink.   For the meal, we split the octopus appetizer, cauliflower appetizer, and Dirty Pasta entree. All were delicious - with the cauliflower & pasta both being pretty large servings. The octopus was pretty awesome - I usually stay away from octopus since it tends to be chewier (personal preference), but the octopus a BatR was lightly breaded, tender, super soft, and super tasty! The cauliflower was very well seasoned as well and filling. We enjoyed the Dirty Pasta, although it did get to be a bit too much/rich for us at the end - a pretty heavy entree but great for sharing!  For dessert, we decided to share the Peaches & Cream donuts - 3 donut holes rolled in cinnamon w/ a scoop of peach ice cream on the side & a couple slices of glazed spiced peaches. It was delicious and a perfect way to end a very hearty meal!   Finally, the service was also very organized & courteous, with the staff being very knowledgeable about the menu as well as approachable for questions. BatR is a great spot for special occasions or a nice dinner (bill for the 2 of us came to ~$90, including tip). A highly recommended spot!"}
{"text":"From the outside, I would never have guessed what I was walking into. Having had reservations for over a month, I was excited to finally get to try out one of Pittsburgh's hot new restaurants. When I walked inside, I felt like I had been transported to a lodge in the middle of nowhere Montana. The rustic decor was frightening yet welcoming. Despite the fanged animals on the walls and tables, I felt very warm and comfortable . . . until I got to our table. After two flights of stairs, (love how the set up of several levels), we were sat at a lounge table with short padded stoles and a small table which was much more appropriate for pre-dinner cocktails, not an entire meal. After looking over the menu, I was tempted by the cocktails but decided to order a glass of wine. The wine selection is very small. I ordered the ham and biscuits (country ham) as well as the cauliflower. I also had the pleasure of trying the mac n cheese and the brussel sprouts. The ham plate arrived first. The salty ham was a great compliment to the biscuits and the orange marmalade was wonderful but, the biscuits were still dry. The cauliflower arrived quite a bit later. The yogurt gave the dish a distinct tanginess that somewhat resembled pickled cauliflower to me. With the description stating there were carrots and brown butter, I was expecting a more savory dish. The best part of my meal so far was the couple of bites of the mac n cheese that I tasted from my dining companions. It was the creamiest, most decadent dish I have had in  . . . well, ever. Since I had room for dessert, I went with the deep fried brownie. It took quite some time for the dessert to arrive. More than 20 minutes actually. Luckily, it was well worth the wait. Remember when you would lick the spoon after mom put the brownies in the oven? Now imagine that uncooked brownie goodness, warm with a crispy outside. Incredible! The bananas and the sorbet were the perfect compliment. Also, unlike the other dishes, I was pleasantly surprised by the size of this dish. Definitely enough to share (two brownies) though you won't want to. It was easily the best dessert I have had since I can remember. Overall, the food was hit or miss for me. The dishes that were on, were incredible while the dishes that were off were only so-so."}
{"text":"I will keep this short because no matter what anyone writes about this place until you try it you will not understand. After a half dozen visits I still cannot fault one aspect of the meal. Drinks are always amazing and well balanced, and their bourbon selection is unparalleled. We always order at least 5 or 6 different small and large plates, but the brussel sprouts will forever be my go-to appetizer. Hands-down my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Stellar Aesthetics.  Great menu.  Great Bourbon Menu.  Great place for two fingers of a new bourbon."}
{"text":"The wild boar \"carbonara\" is a hot pile of burnt cheesy mess and should be removed from the menu. This dish would be a crime in Italy. That aside, wonderful cocktails and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! I live and eat in downtown Charleston,SC, and this place is on point from start to finish!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and drinks.  The scallops and pig wings were awesome, but the Shepard's pie was pretty lame- flavorless and a bit texturally unpleasant.  Dessert (deconstructed smores) were OK, but nothing to write home about.  Our server was attentive but generally disinterested, and we had to wait outside when we arrived.  Cool restaurant, and I'd go again, but generally meh."}
{"text":"Trophy animals killed for decoration line the walls. Unfortunately these animals probably would have had more to offer the world than the guzzlers at the the bar. Hard drinking pick up bar."}
{"text":"One of my best meals. We ended up upstairs at the bar since they were so crowded the night we went. Full menu is available. Great environment and decor. Feels very old timey, like you are in the 30s, but perhaps more noir. The bartenders really know what they are doing. We could not stop ordering drinks, because we kept wanting to try another one. Definitely a place to hit up if you like bourbon cocktails. TFT bone marrow appetizer may be in the top 10 things I have eaten in my life. Do not miss out on that. Will absolutely come here again. This will be on my regular rotation when I am in town."}
{"text":"There are things I love about Butcher...but that upstairs bartender is truly an ass.  I've dealt with him on 3 separate occasions where he was just blatantly rude to a degree I have never experienced in the service industry.  Openly mocking me and treating me so terribly that my date told him flat out he's being a dick.  He was nice to my date for the rest of the evening but not me.  We were going to stay for the rest of the night b/c we love the cocktails there but he absolutely ruined our moods so we left and went elsewhere.  I ended up paying for the meal so his being nice to my date was fruitless for him because, for the first time in my life, I gave well below my standard 30% tip.    I normally would not have gone on this rant publicly and figured that, perhaps, he just remembered me those three times and I 'rubbed him the wrong way', but just yesterday my friend told me about a nearly identical experience she had with him.  I spoke to another friend of mine and the, \"oh, the asshole Asian guy?!\" response says this is just his method of operation.  He deters us from wanting to return.  If he hates serving people drinks so much he should seek employment in another field."}
{"text":"Definitely we will be coming back to this place. The decor is unique and the menu as well. We love everything that we ordered."}
{"text":"Strolled into Butcher and the Rye on a Tuesday evening, without a reservation - which is very unlike me as I am used to the NY restaurant scene. Not to my surprise, the wait was about an hour for a table - but there was bar seating which was fine by me. It was very dimly lit, but the bar was lit behind the bottles - which looked really cool and there was a library ladder attached to the bar which was a nice touch.  We started off with cocktails - I wish I could remember the name, it was one of their punch specials and it was light, refreshing and not overly sweet! Anyway onto the food - when you can't decide what you want, you order it all! My friend and I ordered Mac N Cheese, Cauliflower, Pig Candy and Shishito Peppers. Each bite was better than the last! The cauliflower really stood out and the mix of farro was a great addition to the plate.  My belly was very happy that we made it here while on my trip to Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Love love love it here!!!! It was easy to make the reservation and we got there early so while we were waiting for our table to be ready the bartender offered us glasses of water. The whisky drinks and cocktails we got were amazing. The bread appetizer was awesome!!!! I got the \"dirty pasta\" which has duck in it and my boyfriend got the flank steak. Both were so so good and the service was quality. We will be coming back!!!! The only thing is, the place is super small and on a hot day all the people bunched up together can be a little uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Took my husband here as a surprise for his birthday. THE MEAT! Their unique menu was delightful. We adored everything about this place, especially the chic casual vibe. The bar was packed solid, but next time we'd probably still try to squeeze in to have a few drinks. We didn't want to leave."}
{"text":"Best food. Best cocktails. But only four stars for service. Waiter couldn't recommend a wine to pair with my scallops and the bartender upstairs seemed like she'd rather be anywhere but there. If you can stomach bad, impersonal service to eat some of the best food you'll ever have (I highly recommend the pork belly and the scallops with the crab risotto), it's absolutely worth a trip."}
{"text":"This is hands down one of the best places to go to get food, or a drink. It's certainly a budding hotspot, and it is incredibly hard to get a table on a Friday/Saturday evening. The special cocktail when I went was called \"the Parisian\" I believe, and it was truly fabulous - hints of smoke, faint sweetness without being overwhelming, egg foam, cinnamon. We also shared a cheese plate with friends, which was superlative, though a bit scant on the cheese for the price. Basically I'd recommend this place for drinks if their cocktails hold up this well in the future (we loved the special so much that two of our party got the same one twice). However, I'm unconvinced of the price-to-deliciousness ratio for the food. I'd certainly return to find out."}
{"text":"Considered to be one of the trendy spots in Pittsburgh, Butcher and the Rye didn't live up to the hype for me. Firstly, if you plan on going here, make your reservation a week in advance (at least). It books up very quickly. That being said, it was overly crowded at the bar. The bar tenders were rather slow but that may have something to do with their interesting cocktail menu. We opted for plain whiskey and champagne while we waited for our table.  We were seated in the bar area upstairs next to some extremely loud patrons. They were so loud that I had a ringing in my ear for the rest of the evening. We moved to another table, but the table was so tiny that we couldn't even fit our water and bar drinks on it, let alone food. After the noisy people left, we moved back to our better spot.   The food.... was okay. The cheese board, which was $18, was not worth it at all. The cheese did not seem fresh and the accompaniments were mediocre (a few homemade jams, honey, apples). My husband had the seared sea bass and it was rubbery in the middle and not quite seared. The crispy topping was gummy. My wagyu steak, however, was delicious. I got it medium rare and they subbed out some things I was allergic to with no questions asked.   Overall, I am not sure we will go back for anything but a late night drink."}
{"text":"Fantastic place, the atmosphere, staff, food, and selection of bourbons/whiskey are all amazing!!! Zero complaints, can't wait to return!!"}
{"text":"The food and the service were absolutely wonderful.  We enjoyed the steak tartar, which was rich and delicious. The beet salad had a very tart and tasty salad dressing.  The steak au poive was done to perfection and the dirty pasta was very good with the Pinot noir.  They even waited until everyone was finished before they cleared the table, which normally a pet peeve.  Our only complaint was how loud and hot it was.  Hence 4 stars instead of 5.  We ended up taking our desserts to go because it got to be too much.  We would still highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I came here at 5:00 pm sharp on a Saturday in August to snag an outside table since getting a reservation is so difficult and we had our corgi with us. They had several tables that could seat 4 people outside. The temperature outside was so perfect out. At that time of day, you're in the shade at the outside dining tables. The penicillin cocktail was great. We shared the oxtail raviolo app. The flavors were so complex. We loved the dish! The best part of the meal was the SMOKED LAMB SHANK entree! It was sooo delicious, and you get so much meat with that dish. I got the rabbit dish, and it was good. I'm just a big carnivore, so I had wished there was more meat to the dish rather than shreds of rabbit incorporated into the sauce. Highly recommend checking out this restaurant!"}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've had in some time.  In addition to the incredible food, the service as also top notch.  Our server was available but not overly pushy and incredibly helpful with great food suggestions as well as providing info on some of the different dishes.  I had the filet which was cooked to perfection, and I'm a pretty big stickler about how my steak is cooked.  It was a perfect medium rare with no gray band.  My GF had the scallops and blue crap risotto, which was also exceptional.  This restaurant definitely is my current favorite in the burgh (usurping umami) and I cannot wait to go back again."}
{"text":"My parents were in town and I wanted to show them around our favorite Pittsburgh places so I reserved a table for late in the evening since it tends to get busy in there and wanted to be able to get drinks without fighting a crowd. Drinks were yummy as usual but once the server found out we were not purchasing food he was uninterested in being helpful. Poor service is never fun."}
{"text":"**Disclaimer: I'm not 21, so I couldn't partake in the alcohol that this place is famous for, but sitting in front of the bartender all night made me excited to come back when I'm legal.**  I came to Butcher and the Rye with my dad for a nicer dinner than the kind I usually get in Oakland, and it definitely was a much more upscale atmosphere. Their menu of entrees is a bit limited -- understandable, since it's more of a bar than a traditional full restaurant -- so we instead chose to order a few small plates and an entree.   The Brussels sprouts had good flavor present from the way they were cooked; charred and crispy on the outside, tender on the inside. The lemon aioli was a nice accompaniment. I normally love Brussels sprouts, but unfortunately these were the low point of the night because after a few bites, the flavors were all sort of overtaken by overwhelming saltiness. It was still good, but the oiliness of the sprouts became more evident as well.  The octopus was similarly a bit disappointing. Something about the texture felt a bit off to me. With that said, the bean cakes that it was served on were delicious, and complimented it well, so we had no problem at all eating it (especially the smaller pieces that were nice and crispy on the outside). Pig candy was our third small plate, and that was delicious. Miso caramel sauce made the flavors much more complex and exciting than straightforward glazed pork belly, but didn't take away from the simple goodness of the meat itself either.  We ordered the dirty pasta as an entree, and that was similarly at once simple and intriguing. The brandy added a layer of sweetness that worked well with the duck and made it an interesting, unusual pasta dish.  Dessert was my personal favorite part of the meal. The rosemary ice cream was a standout flavor, popcorn cookies enhanced both the taste and the presentation, and lemon pound cake is pretty much always a win.  Butcher in the Rye has some interesting concepts -- some are well-executed and some fall just a bit flat depending, I'm sure, on the night. Overall, though, it's well worth a try."}
{"text":"Super cool decor. Great music. Excellent food and service. I had the monkfish and the Brussels sprouts--which were awesome. Gorgeous bar area. Unique menu. Fun vibe. Nice crowd. My one and ONLY complaint is that it gets too hot in the restaurant. Probably 80 degrees. The waitress says that it gets even hotter in the summer... so dress in layers. Thinking they should put some $$$ into figuring that out, but other than that, this place is seriously top notch."}
{"text":"Wonderful spot for a romantic dinner. It is on the dark side but the candles on the table give it a really nice ambiance. Had the cheese plate, sourdough bread, eggplant special, and the steak entree. All were wonderful. Our server was knowledgeable, courses were perfectly timed, and overall it was a really nice dining experience!"}
{"text":"Fun, eclectic, restaurant with good service and wonderful food (except my dish). The charcuterie appetizer was excellent and creative. My wife ordered the scallops. They were large and cooked perfectly. My friends ordered the roasted chicken and the burger. Both were very happy with their dishes. I had the pappardelle. Great flavor but super salty - so much that it started taking away from the great flavor midway through the meal. Would definitely go again but will avoid the pappardelle next time."}
{"text":"Great food, drinks and ambience! Just hard to get reservations last minute. Great date night restaurant."}
{"text":"One of the joints that are at the forefront of Pittsburgh's rapid culinary boom, doing it right and making great experiences for people.  The food is absolutely amazing.  The cocktails are on point.  The atmosphere is amazing.  The service is phenomenal. My one request would be that our server doesn't ask us if we want cocktails *every* time he visits. Sometimes it's nice just to get checked up on. He was wonderful nonetheless, and it was great to know someone wanted to make sure we were getting delicious drinks when we wanted them!  I recommend requesting reservations upstairs at the Rye Bar.  Thanks for being so awesome, Butcher!"}
{"text":"First off the drinks were outstanding, food very well prepared but it all came out at once, even the soup and salad. This makes it easy on the cooks but is sloppy for someone who can dine at the very best and has higher standards.  The focaccia was nothing special. The fried peppers were well prepared but overloaded with salt. We sent back the cauliflower dish.  It is very very loud which takes away from  its appeal  The reason for my low rating is the AC Was  on the wall next  to the bar and said 78 f It was so hot!  We were so uncomfortable, it ruined our experience totally. This is unacceptable. We sat at the downstairs bar. The upper floor must have been sweating from heat and humidity  No fans were  here to move air around. I was told the AC  units were scheduled to be fixed. I have a photo of the AC reading but can't find how to post it on here.  I wish they had vegan or vegetarian choices. The menu is full of all kinds of dead animal parts and sprinkled with dairy"}
{"text":"This is probably on the low end of a 4 for me.     What's good:  - The ambiance - The place is stunning, with lots of rustic and modern touches kind of mixed together.  There is a wall of bourbon and whiskey bottles behind the bar, many of which are accessed with a library ladder.  Lots to look at and enjoy at this place.    - The service - Our server was friendly and knowledgeable.   The only criticism I had was that when several of us ordered two appetizers as our meals, her default was to serve them together.  I get it, the place is packed and you turn tables over faster that way, but I would have preferred an option and she phrased it as a \"this is what's going to happen unless you want to object\" kind of thing.    - The variety - The menu was filled with yummy looking things that I wanted to try.     What's so-so:   - The food - or rather, the consistency of the food.  I ordered the Crispy Pig Wing, which was downright delicious. The bone marrow, however, was less than stellar.  Further, it was TINY.   Maybe a tablespoon of marrow on a single bone.  I honestly think that bone was just cut unevenly, because one of my companions had a bone with a much deeper groove.  She probably had at least 3 times as much marrow as I did.  They ought to know better than to serve such vastly different portions to the same table (or at all really).  The skimpy serving ruined an otherwise really tasty dish.  Both dishes also could have been a tad warmer. - The value - I don't mind small portions at all, but some of my companions had dishes that seemed pretty skimpy for what they paid.  The burrata for example, was very small.  We had considered splitting it as an app, but I'm glad we didn't because it would have been about a bite each.   For $12 or $15 or something...can't remember the exact price, but I do recall thinking that it was outrageous once the dish appeared.  - The bathroom.   So the stall doors are about waist high, which means that,  anyone standing on the other side of the door can pretty much see your lady parts.   Bad form, Butcher, bad form."}
{"text":"Overall a good experience, but definitely over-hyped here in Pittsburgh. Great service, immense selection of booze, and wonderful atmosphere/decor/vibe.  The whiskey selection is second to none in the city, and while pricing is ambitious, it was great to try a few things I have been wanting for a long time.  Unfortunately, the food was not up to par to the hype or the pricing. For a place with \"butcher\" right in the name, the meats selection is just not there. The entrees just failed to impress. While I strongly prefer quality over quantity, the quality was just not there to justify the tiny portions we received.   I had the scallops since again, there wasn't much from the butcher, and the ingredients sounded enticing. What I received was 3 small overcooked scallops on a bed of over-salted risotto. It was hard to judge the flavor of the risotto due to the salt. I forget what vegetable was served, but I remember it was burned.The risotto was cooked well though, texture-wise.  My date had the roasted chicken. Again, enticing description, but over-salted. Fortunately the salt was not so extreme so the flavor came through and it was pretty good and the chicken was cooked nicely. Again, tiny portion. I have never seen my date finish an entree and she finally finished one here.  We definitely had room for dessert, but based on the entrees, we decided to skip that.  I will wrap up on a positive note: the appetizers. We ordered the tartar and the rabbit rillette, and both were just to die for. It's the first time I had an appetizer in Pittsburgh that did what it's supposed to do - it made me look forward to the rest of dinner."}
{"text":"In the movie version of \"American Psycho,\" the title character was shown dining at some of the more ludicrous yuppie high-concept restaurants of late-1980s New York.    Is the Butcher and the Rye a Patrick Bateman restaurant for the 2010s?  It is about as production-designed as any restaurant you'll see, a two-story approximation of some Wild West saloon of the near apocalyptic future.  There's a giant wall of brown liquor--probably three hundreds bottles' worth--that stretches so high that ladders are required to reach many of them.  That wall is mightily impressive from both a visual and connoisseur's viewpoint.  And the dim, low-ceilinged barroom upstairs where we were seated definitely achieves some of the rough-hewn Western atmosphere the owners were shooting for.  The Butcher and the Rye comes from a pretty common template these days:  A temple of over-the-top carnivorousness, it's devoted to many varieties of animal flesh prepared in a variety of ways, accompanied by a conspicuous focus on brown liquor and craft cocktails.  When we male metrosexual dweebuses are reduced by 21st century society to walking around while tapping on our little mini-keyboards, a place like the Butcher and the Rye apparently is supposed to allow us to reassert our Manly Virtues.  Or something.    Anyway, I like to eat meat (within reason), and the Butcher and the Rye seemed like a great place to do it.  (Sure, there are non-meat items on the menu, but you come to a place like this to eat meat.)  Upon reading the menu, it seemed like an ideal one for shared-plates dining, but (as suggested further below) our server was of little help in steering us toward a coherent line-up of food.  We tried to put one together anyway, with mixed results.  The charcuterie board was a good start--a generous variety of both cured meats and pickled veggies, plus plenty of crostini.  Some of the meats stood out more than others.  \"Pig candy\" was pork belly with house kimchi and offered a well-balanced if somewhat generic Korean flavor profile; it was good, but not amazingly so.  For a meat-centric place, the cauliflower, which came with roasted faro and romanesco, was excellent, and came in a healthy portion.  We were the most excited about the \"Sunday Gravy\"--which came with lamb neck, tomatoes, olive oil, and ricotta, plus more crostini--but while it had deep flavor, texturally it was a bit of a mushy mess.    All in all, the food was good, but not quite at the level suggested by the reviews.  I should note that a night earlier we were at the superb Morcilla, which although in roughly the same price range was easily a notch or two better, food-wise.  Yes, I recognize that I am comparing apples and oranges, food-wise; they're very different restaurants.  But maybe that negatively shaded my impression here.  Biggest problem on this evening, though, was our cold-fish main server.  She had the full-sleeve tattoo that is de rigueur for her line of work in 2016--I cast zero judgment on that--but otherwise had the appearance, attitude, and demeanor of a snooty sorority vice-president or junior account executive.  From the standpoint of taking our orders and getting them brought to the table, she did a reasonably effective job (and the guy who brought our big charcuterie plate patiently explained everything on it).  But from the standpoint of informatively answering just two or three very simple questions about the menu or the very basic courtesy of making us feel welcome, she certainly did not.  (As in all such judgments, I recognize that people have bad days, and maybe she was having one.)  Call it a hair short of three-and-a-half."}
{"text":"The bartender Joseph was very nice and helpful. The Pig Wing is a must have. The beet salad was a bit and the pickled mangoes that was on top had no taste of mangoes,  just Tart. The chocolate mousse was also very yummy."}
{"text":"This place doesn't live up to the hype or price.    So I used to love Meat and Potatoes, which is owned by the same people.  Then I went to Cure, and I realized how amazing a \"meat-centric\" (is that a thing?) restaurant could be.  Butcher and the Rye is the same way.  It's super-cool, and it's definitely worth going to check out the decor and the multi-story bar.  The food is good, but it didn't knock my socks off.  To wit, I ate there about two weeks ago and I have zero recollection of what I had even though the meal cost well over $100.    If you're a whiskey aficionado, as is my boyfriend, you'd probably love this place, but even he was underwhelmed by the food.    It's great when new, upscale, non-chain restaurants open in the Pittsburgh area.  But as of yet, Butcher and the Rye isn't worth the wait for a reservation."}
{"text":"Drinks are amazing, and their mac and cheese is to die for!"}
{"text":"Just fabulous in every way.  The decor is amazing, food was fantastic, prices were decent.  Portions are very small.    They had a brussel sprout and brown butter dish that everyone agreed was the best thing we all ate.  It's a good place to order 5-6 things for 3 people and have everyone share.  You won't be full off one dish."}
{"text":"So, the idea of this restaurant is wonderful. The ambiance is great, the food was good (some plates spectacular), and it's clear a lot of art and culinary skill emanate from the kitchen. However, for some reason, our waitress tonight was just absolutely unpleasant and unprofessional. I love to ask questions to know more about a dish's profile, and when I said \"I have another question,\" she rolled her eyes and said \"ok\" in a very condescending manner. Then, one of our party was looking through the pictures on yelp to make a final decision, and when the waitress was going through to take orders she lingered on her; so the others explained that she's trying to figure out what she wants. The waitress had the audacity to respond, \"On her phone? Has she even looked at the menu?\" Not to mention the rude tone, to top it off. First of all, Melanie, even if she were texting and ignoring you, your profession does not condone that kind of interaction with the customers. Please check your attitude. And no, trying to be nice the last two minutes with our table will not ensure you get your tip. It's unfortunate that a server can ruin the atmosphere for such a great restaurant."}
{"text":"Wonderful culinary experience! Wish I could give 11 stars!  Crispy Pig wing, Sunday gravy, octopus special, and the cauliflower were all exceptional. Spider, our waiter, was very attentive and professional. Ambiance is perfect."}
{"text":"While in town for a Penns game, the manager at our hotel suggested this place for good cocktails. They were right! When we arrived the place was packed. The bar is rather small with stools being a premium. The back bar is shelves with fine whiskey's and bourbon. In fact, they have wooden ladders on rails, like the ones you would see in an old library, to reach the upper shelves. I ask the bartender, Allyson for a \"smokey\" and she suggested their \"Blood & Sand\". It was outstanding. I want to come back for a meal."}
{"text":"Sunday Gravy was amazing, and the whiskey and drinks were on point. Scallops and mussels were good but not great. The atmosphere was amazing and they had great service."}
{"text":"I have heard nothing but good things about this place... And they are all true!  Finally went tonight with friends. Had an amazing Moscow Mule. Brussel sprouts, cauliflower, roasted chicken and the AMAZING fried apple pie. The presentation on every dish is so beautiful and the flavor a compliment each other so well.  I tried everything that my friends had and it was all beyond fantastic. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I went here over the weekend with some friends to celebrate a friend's new job. I had never been, but heard a lot of good things, and was excited to try it out.  My husband and I arrived before our friends and before our table was ready (we had a reservation), so we headed to the bar to get some drinks They have this bar that you can sit at that's actually across from the real bar. I assumed that we would have to go stand at the bar to order our drinks, but someone came to us with menus and served us from there. It seems minor, but it was a nice touch.  Once our friends arrived and our table was ready, we were seated. Our table was upstairs. I love the atmosphere inside! It's very unique and interesting.  We ordered some bread for the table. The sourdough was delicious, as were the dipping sauces they provided. I ordered the mac n cheese as well as their seasonal salad (which was a potato salad) for my entree. I am a vegetarian and they didn't have a ton of options, but I have to say that what I did order was awesome. I was uneasy about the potato salad because I don't love mayo and was envisioning typical American potato salad, but this was very different. I don't think there was any mayo in it. It was awesome. And the mac n cheese was great - I loved all the breading on top. It was also extremely filling - I was only able to eat about half.  I knocked off a star for a few reasons: one, I wish they had more veggie options. I know that it's literally called \"butcher in the rye\", but still. Would have been nice. Also, we were seated upstairs and it was HOT. It was a hot day outside and it seemed like the AC didn't push upstairs. And lastly, the lounge style seating up there is cool, but a little uncomfortable. There's no back support, which can get uncomfortable after a long meal.  All in all, I loved it and will definitely return."}
{"text":"Not sure what took me so long to try this restaurant when I'm a big fan of Meat & Potatoes, but I really need to try their other restaurants now.  The food, drinks, service, and ambiance were wonderful. I'm a big fan and can't wait to get back. I need to remember that they take reservations, too, but sitting at the bar worked very well. The only down side is that they don't open until 5, so if you're trying to get there early to get a seat and get there too early, you have to figure out where to wander around (and in this heat, how not to melt before the bar opens)."}
{"text":"My expectations might have been too high, but we did not come away impressed. We had reservations for a Friday night and asked for a different table since we were seated right on top of others. We were finally moved to a different table, but they made is feel like it was a big deal. There were numerous tables in the bar area with reserved signs that were still empty when we left. Drinks and dessert were excellent. Pig Candy was the best thing we tried. The scallop entree is somewhat small, but was delicious. Mussels for an appetizer were a generous portion. Overall we enjoyed our meal and cocktails, but thought the price was a little high for what you received."}
{"text":"After hearing great things about Butcher and the Rye, my friend made a reservation for us a few Friday nights ago.  We had reservations for 5 PM on a Friday night when there was a baseball game.  So while parking was a problem, we got a day of reservation with no issues.    As I had sat through meetings at many coffee shops that day, I just couldn't order a drink.  This was a total bummer, but there are plenty of alcoholic options if you are interested in a drink.  To begin we started with the crispy Pig Wing ($9) and Sunday Gravy ($10).  I loved both appetizers.  The pig wing was surrounded with thai chili sauce, pickled mango salad, peanuts, and cilantro.  The Sunday Gravy was heated tomatoes, lamb neck, olive oil, and ricotta served with grilled bread.  The Sunday Gravy was a significantly larger portion, but I couldn't pick a favorite appetizer if I had to!  For an entree, I ordered the Dirty Pasta ($16), and my friend ordered the Shepherd's pie ($20).  The Dirty Pasta was SPECTACULAR, and it is strozzapretti tossed in ground duck, sage, brandy, and pecorino Romano.  I would 100% recommend this dish.  It is absolute perfection and beyond words.  The Shepherd's Pie was a bit strange.  The braised beef was wonderful, but it was mostly vegetables and there was no crust.  It wasn't bad, just not what we expected.  I loved the atmosphere of the restaurant as well.  The main level is a bit farm-y, and the second level is very wildlife oriented.  I really liked the atmosphere of the second level, and it would be great for a more intimate evening.  Unfortunately, as others have pointed out, the bathrooms are awkward.  Just awkward.  It is a rarity that I go anywhere without checking out Yelp before I go so I didn't realize this was the sister restaurant of Meat and Potatoes.  This makes total sense.  I will absoltely come back to Butcher and the Rye."}
{"text":"No doubt one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh. My favorite dishes of the night include an octopus appetizer, which was SO tender and rich, and my friend's dirty pasta (remix of dirty rice). The rest of the food was also extremely good (brussels, pig wing, pork and lobster pasta). Waiter was very attentive. The only downside is that the place is fairly dim, but it adds to the intimate ambiance!"}
{"text":"This was just okay. However nothing was impressive and very pricey. We got a lot of the dishes that the server recommended and told us were popular but nothing blew us away. We got the cheese plate and tartar which was unnecessarily talked up and was just okay at best. We went because it keeps getting rave reviews and is constantly on top Pittsburgh Restaurants articles. But they struggled a lot with service and took a very long time with all of our dishes. The ambiance and decor is really nice but don't think it makes up for meals. I would probably never go back especially since it was so expensive.  Definitely think this place is over hyped and if you have a choice I would say go to Sienna Mercado which is on the same street or Nicky's Thai Kitchen."}
{"text":"Tried to sit next to my wife at the communal tables, we were quickly informed this was against the rules and I would have to sit across from her.  We're not really into rules so we left.  Perhaps someday I'll get to try a cocktail. The place looks very nice."}
{"text":"Finally made it to Butcher and the Rye and it was everything I hoped!  It looks small, but there are lots of tables up stairs too.  Definitely make a reservation!  We went on a wedn night at 730 and the place was packed! They had a few wines by the glass and a large assortment of beers. Penn brewery makes a few special beers just for butcher and the rye!  Ask for a sample.   I started with the beet salad, which didn't even need the dressing.  It was excellent!  My fiancé had the pig candy which he ate in complete silence bc he was enjoying it so much.  For dinner I had the trout.  It was also excellent.  It comes out as a whole fish, so be prepared.  It was excellently seasoned and had a yummy creamy sauce underneath.  The only thing I didn't like was that the cauliflower was under the fish and hard to get to, but tasted delicious once I got some.  For dessert they had a special s'mores deconstruction that was delicious!  The bourbon marshmallows were amazing!!! Overall the place is loud, but the food is tasty and the staff is wonderful!"}
{"text":"Who needs comfy chairs with a drink menu like this?  Butcher and why would you go anywhere else?"}
{"text":"A great place to have small dishes with a couple of drinks. It's very busy so we sit at the bar area. Food is sooooo good! Try the Brussels and you won't be disappointed. The YUZU sour is very good (a sour but refreshing feeling). If you like a little spicy in your drink, try the Nauti-mule (jalapeño,YES). The environment is great for girls date~ we ordered one dish at a time and end up ordering like 5 of them. Totally worth the experience:)"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was really really pretty. Something different for sure. Good place for drinks and hanging out. The food was not very good. Very random meals."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere with interesting food to try. My sister took me out, and we tried the bone marrow, the bread, pig candy, and pig belly. I drank the sampler of whiskey, and after wards ordered the rusty nail. We went on a Saturday, but was surprised after around midnight it was quite empty. That was all of Downtown however. Do no forget the restroom it even had style."}
{"text":"Went in on a Tuesday night, very busy, so recommend reservations (though there were a few open spots at the bar for those of you looking for something last minute).  There were five of us, so were able to order quite a few plates (I'd recommend doing this if you could).  Here's what we had, all were very good, and we've already made reservations for next week...  -Pig Candy :  Pork Belly with kimchi.   -Mac & Cheese : Ohhhhhhhhh...this was soooo good.  MUST try, even if you don't like Mac & Cheese.   -Roasted Brussel Sprouts : Yum!   -Shishito Peppers : Very good.  Not hot but a little bit of spice. -Mussels : Didn't try them myself (not a fan) but the others said they were very good.  My main entree was the Dirty Pasta (pasta with Rabbit meat).  Also very good!    Also, if you are a whiskey drinker, this place is heaven.  The bar has a ceiling high display with various selections.    Price wasn't too bad...averaged $50/person but that included each person averaging a tapas plate, a main entree and a couple of drinks."}
{"text":"They say they are open till 2:00 AM. At 1:20 we went there and they were closed with all the chairs stacked up on tables.  I called and the message says they are closed. They get 1 star for being liars."}
{"text":"This place is scrumptious. People rave about their dirty pasta so to make this post easy and I am going to just tell you to get the dirty pasta. If you want a little something extra get the pig candy. If you are feeling very adventurous get the bone marrow. Do not be scared, it is very tasty and melts in the mouth. Ohh and wash it down with one of their tasty cocktails."}
{"text":"I really love the decor of this place and yes, the food is delicious too as well as good service :) I had the Scallops and their Chocolate Pot which were both delicious. Definitely worth giving this place a try and coming back for more."}
{"text":"So Butcher and the Rye is of course one of \"those restaurants\" that everyone always talks about and recommends as a \"must\" while in the Pittsburgh area. I have to admit I am always a bit skeptical on the hype that exists over any restaurants but even with this skepticism I was looking forward to the opportunity to dine at this joint. I made my way over on a Tuesday. The interior is broken up into two floors with tables and a bar on the first floor as well as the second floor. I opted to go to the second floor to grab a seat at the bar. The décor is a cool and has a hustle and bustle vibe to it. The first floor has a pretty impressive wall of drinks stacked up against it with a nice chandelier thing hanging.   The few times ive been here, I was always immediately greeted when sitting at the bar and pretty shortly thereafter provided a menu for perusal. They have a pretty solid array of food and drinks so the last few visits have been me asking the bartender for their recommendations for drinks/food. These guys are executing solid cocktails and drinks and were able to meet my random requests for recommendations. After a bit of perusing of the menu, I immediately gravitated towards the pig candy and the dirty pasta based on all the rave reviews. Both were really solid and definitely let me feel I was enjoying the finer cuisine in life. The pig candy is delicious and has the perfect compliments of spices and sweetness to it and is perfectly married with the pork belly. The dirty pasta has the perfect amount of ingredients and is made perfectly as well. It is tossed with ground duck , sage, and pecorino romano making it just heavenly. The noodles were cooked to perfection and I think I literally had to stop myself from licking the plate clean. I have also had the opportunity to try the steak here which was cooked perfectly and delicious with the right amount of tenderness behind it.   All in all, my favorite joint in Pittsburgh so far and definitely a spot that I will try to hit as frequently as possible"}
{"text":"I didn't expect to love this place as much as I do.  Actually, I expected to think it was overrated and a waste of time to go to.  Now- it's one of my favorite restaurants and I cannot get enough of it.    I cannot rave enough about the food... I have had the Mussels, Brussel sprouts, Baked Camembert, Cauliflower, Mac and Cheese and have loved all of those small plates.  Amazing is how to define the Brussel sprouts in one word actually.  Entree wise I have nibbled on my husband's Butcher burger (so good and they only make 20 a day), the scallops and the skirt steak... Loved it all too.    The service has been spectacular each of the 3 times I have gone.  The Bourbon list is massive, and the drinks are top notch.  I highly recommend this amazing place."}
{"text":"Wanted to try somewhere a little more upscale downtown and decided on Butcher and the Rye based on reviews. Glad we did!   Reservations are encouraged, especially for the weekend. We made ours two days ahead of time via Yelp and got great seats on the 3rd floor, where it was more quiet. If you have a specific time you wanna come, I suggest making the reservation further in advance. The earliest option for us was a 9pm reservation, so that's what we did.  Ambiance - It's pretty dark inside, but it was definitely more casual than I thought it would be. The interior reminded me of the inside of a Victorian home with their wallpaper, wooden staircases, and taxidermied animals. It stays true to the Americana theme they are going for.  Service - Hosts, waiters, staff were all great and super helpful. Service was attentive, but not intrusive.  Food - Came here with bf and we split everything. Pig Candy: Pork belly served with apple kimchi. This was my least favorite dish, but it wasn't bad, it was just very average. I appreciate the thought behind this, where they took a very Asian inspired dish and made it their own by swapping out Asian ingredients for American ones i.e. switching out napa kimchi for apple kimchi, daikon radish for red radish. I felt like the pork belly could've been more melt in your mouth.   Charcuterie Board: I was surprised at all the stuff you got for $20! There's even foie gras! The foie here was a little gamier than the ones I like, but spread over toast, it was still pretty good. The spread included multiple kinds of pork, duck, pickled fennel, peppers, cauliflower, whole grain mustard and pork fat butter. Aside from the meat, the cauliflower and mustard really stood out. We didn't really like the pork fat butter. It was cool how they made something so heavy tasting super light and airy, but it still felt like you were eating fat.  Steak Tartare: This was my favorite dish. I love anything tartare. It was light, sweet, and flavorful. I really liked the perfect consistency of the egg yolk that came with it, but wish there was maybe a second yolk since it was such a big serving. I was scraping up any bits that we dropped and we ate every last bite. I would still have to say that I prefer horse taretare over steak tartare, but I'm not sure you can find horse tartare in the US (had it in Europe & Asia). But steak is still yummy.  Dirty Pasta (w/ Ground Duck) - Such a HUGE portion for $20. The pasta noodles were excellent!! I loved the texture and chew. Overall the dish was good, but also really heavy since duck is surprisingly fatty and all the cheese and stuff. If you're also getting small plates, I highly recommend splitting this. Would absolutely not have been able to finish this on my own.  Drinks- Didn't try any of their whiskey, but they have a great beer selection as well. Well priced.  Price - I'm from D.C. and I'm used to paying big city prices. I love coming out to Pittsburgh to visit the BF because we get to indulge in decadent meals and not bleed our wallets. After drinks, food, tax, tip, our total was something like just under $120.   Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Aside from the 2 week wait for a weekend reservation at a reasonable hour (I suspect that wait will increase), my experience at the Butcher and the Rye was fabulous. We came early to enjoy a cocktail, and ended up (through the evening of course) sampling the Moscow mule, the Pittsburgh Smash, the Holden on and the Lions tail. All were tasty, but I must admit the Pittsburgh Smash was my favorite. The bar area is small, and after dinner got very crowded, but luckily the bartenders were attentive and the service was great. One thing from this experience that I can assure you won't get elsewhere is the decor... Very interesting but difficult to describe and so worth the trip to see firsthand! We ordered the Brussels sprouts, duck pasta, crispy pig wing, pig candy, wagyu flank, as well as one of their flank steak specials. The Brussels sprouts (crispy and heavenly) and dirty duck pasta (perfectly cooked protein and noodle) were the winners! We ordered a little more than what our lovely waitress thought fit for a dinner for two, but no matter, the leftovers were just as tasty the next day. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Finally went to Butcher and the Rye last night.  We got a super early reservation which was about as good as we could do for literally weeks.  The place, however, was less than 1/2 full (except for the two bars) the entire time we were there (5:20-7:15).  Which made me wonder why it's so hard to get a res?  Oh, well.  Just note this suggests you can pop in after all.  The decor is interesting.  NYC-hipster-trendy-meets-hunting-lodge?  I thought it was interesting.  My husband was like, huh?  The service was prompt and very pleasant.  A definite A plus.    Of course the drinks and menu bore comparison to M&P, which we love.  This menu seemed bigger and a bit funkier/less \"accessible\" than M&P.  Lots of aps/small pates, which is a big plus to me.  Not too much on the menu for pickier eaters.  (Actually, my husband had a limited selection, but I blame him for being picky... doesn't care for tomatoes, pasta and several varieties of cheese... rather limiting.)    We both started with manhattans, which were easily on par with the ones at the speakeasy at the william penn.  Definitely worth the trip alone.  I ordered three apps, because I like to taste things (and don't mind left overs).  I had the special greens & beans, brussels and shisihto.  The greens & beans were an interesting take and were tasty enough, but nothing overwhelming.  The brussels and shishito were delish.  I would definitely order them again.  Roasted brussels sprouts with dill and lemon aoli and shishito (japanese peppers) with siracha aioli -- yum!    My husband ordered the hanger steak feature, which he declared one of the best food compositions, if not the best, he's ever eaten.  He just wished there was more of it.  (Not a huge portion size and he's a big guy.... he should have ordered a salad...)  I also had a sazerac.  Expertly crafted.    Total bill came to $104, which I thought was pretty reasonably for the quality of the food.  Cocktails are $10, which is downright cheap for this sort of place downtown.  All in all, we'd definitely go back.  Next time, I'd probably just do apps at the bar with cocktails."}
{"text":"This was the best food experience I had on a trip to the great city of Pittsburgh.  Everything form the service to the food was phenomenal.  I live in DC but I make it a point to come back."}
{"text":"\"Disappointing\" is the word which best describes this place. Visited it for the first time while I was in town with several friends. Both the reviews and photos compelled me to expect the place to stand out, but unfortunately it fell short. And folks, it fell hard...   Environment The layout of the restaurant is unique. A bar at the entrance is the primary focal point upon walking in and a lengthy staircase leads up to a multi-level dining area for those uninterested in drinks at the bar. It's an after-hours kind of vibe of half-hipster and half-country. It doesn't really find itself fully committed to either aesthetic, unfortunately, and results in what looks like an argument between two generations of owners.  Food This is where Butcher and the Rye was least impressive. Food quality and presentation were both weak. I had ordered the strip steak and one of my friends ordered the rabbit and dumplings. The steak was on the colder side (not the...\"slight cool\" pink you expect from something medium rare) and tasted like it came from your average crockpot stew which is confusing given how well reviewed it was on Yelp. The only highlight of our entire meal was the pumpkin pie dessert which was tasty, warm, and surprisingly fun in flavor. The chocolate cheesecake must have been bought at the local Walmart because it tasted like one of those pre-made desserts you don't really want to buy at the store for your friend's get-together, but you do anyways because it's fast, cheap, and no one will know that you brought it kind of thing.  Drink Selection Let's be honest here...if you're going to so obviously make your bar the focal point of your restaurant, it better rock my socks right off. Butcher's doesn't. It has a surprisingly small list of options and what it does have are seasonally similar.   Overall It's not worth it. There are surely better options in Pittsburgh than this place and the highly acclaimed reviews of it must spawn from entirely different times of day or food selections because they were not remotely close to what one would expect from such a rating for a restaurant. I do get the irony of me saying this, especially given the lengths I've gone in this review to so heavily critique this place, but the word \"pretentious\" comes to mind when witnessing the dining the experience here. It feels like it's pushing itself to be something unique when in reality...it comes up as predictable."}
{"text":"Everything about this place was perfection. First off, my waitress Naomi was a sweetheart and she took really good care of me. She recommended a drink according to my preference and it was spot on (Jack's Rose). I had their bread that comes with their house gravy and my entree, which I was set on prior to coming here, was the scallops with blue crab risotto. Best fucking risotto I've ever had. It was rich and had asparagus and somewhat crispy spinach as well as bits of mushrooms. Everything complimented each other so well. I'll definitely be back to try other dishes when I'm in the 'Burgh again."}
{"text":"From the second we walked in we knew it was the right place to be for a great dinner!  My daughter had picked the restaurant for our first trip to Pittsburgh and after looking at the menu we knew it would be an extended dinner....Josh is an AMAZING waiter...attentive, great suggestions and knew the product like the back of his hand!!!! Pate was fantastic...best I have EVER had and the scallops....I am salivating just thinking about them.  Honestly cannot wait for the next trip to Pittsburgh to visit again.  And if you are a whisky drinker ask for the menu....daughter the bartender had a blast trying to figure out which of the tasty selections to imbibe upon.  Be sure to make reservations...even during the week!  Thanks for making our first trip to Pittsburgh even better!"}
{"text":"I just want to say how much I appreciate this place for making an off-menu vegetarian item for me. The server was super nice about this, and I wound up having a great time."}
{"text":"Butcher and the Rye's got that upscale Gaston's tavern feel to it.  We made reservation ahead of time and got a text from their hostess 10 minutes prior to let us know our table was ready.  I'm new to Pittsburgh so I wasn't sure how wait time is but reservation is the way to go.  Downtown restaurants are crawling with people dining from 6 - 8 PM.  We've had a few drinks before dinner so the first thing we ordered was the bread (Mmmm carbs).  It's paired with an herb butter spread and gravy.  Aside from the need of carbs, I enjoyed it.  For appetizers, we ordered the tartare and the pig candy.  The beef tartare was spread on top of a toasted bread (yes, more carbs) and we loved the truffle aloli poached egg yolk on the side.  It's likely to inspire many of our homemade eggs now.  The pig candy, which is a chunk of pork belly, was less inspiring.  However, It was sweet, saucy, and meaty.  For the main course of the night, we shared the pappardelle with pork and lobster.  This sealed the night for me as I enjoyed everything from the grounded pork to the bite-sized (although I wouldn't mind bigger pieces personally) lobster tail to the pappardelle to the sauce!  The sauce was better than I expected for a pasta dish.  We ended the night with the doughnuts. Expect cinnamon and happiness."}
{"text":"I know that this is their first week but this could be one of the best new restaurants in Pittsburgh. As a follow up to Meat & Potatoes, it is clearly a superior effort by Chef Richard DeShantz. Bourbon & Rye may be a key feature of this restaurant but the bar doesn't dominate the space like it does at Meat & Potatoes.  We arrived with no reservation tonight and were offered a table inside with an hour and a half wait or an outdoor table on Sixth St. at which we could dine immediately. We chose to sit outside and dine al fresco.  The few outdoor tables had heaters above them that made it quite comfortable to dine outside on a fall night.  We decided not to delve into one of the 350 bourbons that they claimed to have and instead ordered a pair of whiskey based cocktails.  My wife had a Butcher Sour and I chose the Pittsburgh Smash with Wigle Rye.  The Smash was just what I wanted.  The blackberries, mint and lime gave the drink a nice, tart note.    Our server went through the menu with us quickly and explained that the dishes are smaller plates and designed to be shared.  We ordered the cauliflower, oxtail manicotti, rabbit saddle and octopus.    If I were to do it again, I would not order the rabbit.  Not because it was bad but more because it just didn't feel like a complete dish.  There were too many components and it made it hard to get everything into a single bite.    The cauliflower and the octopus really stood out. As a vegetable dish, the cauliflower came with farro and felt like a complete entree instead of just some vegetarian side.  The octopus was super tender and the spicy sauces really brought it home.  My wife is also a sucker for scallops and garbonzo beans.  The octopus dish had both.    I don't want to leave out the manicotti because it was also good but just not as AMAZING as the other two.  I really liked the idea of the pickled apple on top and the fresh fennel. Typically. you would see the apple as the fresh component with pickled fennel so this was a nice twist on complimenting flavors.  We split the german chocolate for dessert.  This is more of a deconstructed twist on german chocolate cake with rich chocolate sorbet and a gooey butter cake. It was tasty and it wasn't too sweet, which is what I like at the end of the meal.  There are two things that I would change. First of all, most of the dishes were garnished with a weird type of green that had been fried. It was too big, got in the way and didn't add any flavor. It was also greasy.  The second issue was that it was a little pricey. Definitely higher than Meat & Potatoes and the portions are tapas to appetizer sized.  Overall, this is a great addition to the Pittsburgh dining scene and downtown.  We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I don't know why it took so long for the wife and I to visit, but what a great meal. I prefer the dark ambiance of the place. Over 100 whiskies with preselected flights to choose from. I had the filet and my wife had the ground duck pasta dish. Both were cooked perfectly. Has an upstairs and downstairs bar. Great menu. Try the cheese board as an appetizer. Very impressed."}
{"text":"We just moved here from Salt Lake City. This was an awesome first date night out for us. Next time I'm going to bring ALL my wives!!! It was that good!  The Moscow Mules are served in the copper mug, as they should be. We had some cheese plates, the Brussels, Pig Candy, and some scallops that were cooked perfectly. Very rich food, but SOOO GOOD."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere and choice of music. Nice variety of handcrafted cocktails & svotches. Caesar Salad , mac & cheese, filet were all very good."}
{"text":"If you can get past the contrived, super cliché hipster atmosphere (is it a speakeasy? hunting lodge? farmhouse?...whatever it is, it is almost comical how hipster it is) the food is good and the servers are friendly and attentive. I started with the sprouts, which were excellent. The portion was too big, so by the time I was in the 5th large spoonful, the novelty had worn off.  If the portion was half the size, I would have finished the dish with just enough to keep me interested. In this case, less is more. After an appropriate wait (not too long, not too short) I had the flank steak, which was damn near perfect. The bed of warm potato salad had just enough blue cheese to make you take notice.  Unfortunately, the atmosphere was trying so hard to be authentic that it did a disservice to the experience, and made it feel more like a theme restaurant. If they would can the trendy look and just focus on the food, this place would crush it...."}
{"text":"Menu is very unique whether you're looking for a drink or a meal.  Tried a couple different cocktails and both were great.  For dinner had the pig wing and the smoked lamb neck and was very impressed with both!"}
{"text":"Been trying to go here for awhile now. Did not disappoint. Sat upstairs, kinda cozy with encyclopedias on bookcases surrounding us. Homey feel. Had the pork belly and the duck pate for starters...oh my goodness, oh my goodness. Wife had scallops and i had the papardelle with rabbit. Both were delicious. Waiter was flawless, no complaints. Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"I struggle with \"bests\".  But as of right now, this is my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh.  Their menu has a lot of originality and creativity in it.  There's a nice balance of foods and everything I have had there has been wonderful.    Best brussel sprouts in the burgh, and there's LOTS of competition  Pig Candy is a must try.    And of course...the rye flight.  Staff knows their business.  The young woman who waited on my sister and I during our most recent visit impressed me with her knowledge of the menu and the bar, steering us deftly toward options that satisfied our palates and warned us of impending danger (one example:  \"they say that one in twelve shishito peppers is really hot, but lately they've been trending a bit hotter\" - in response to my sister's question regarding whether the shishito small plate might be too spicy for her)  If there's any downside it's that some of the seating is cramped and shoulder to shoulder with adjacent tables.  And it's noisy, which might stand between you and that romantic evening out that you'd planned.  If you make reservations far enough in advance, a table of four will get you seated beneath the \"antler chandelier\" where the tables are a bit larger and the elbow room a substantially improved.  But if you don't mind lifting your voice a bit, and making new friends, then I think Butcher is lock for a great night out with a friend."}
{"text":"Went with a group of 7 for a work function. Needed to make reservations about 3 weeks in advance to score a table on a Thursday night. Not a complaint, but more of a heads up to those who want to try Butcher and the Rye Out. Not really the place where you can show up at on a whim and expect to get seated.  We each ordered a different appetizer with the Brussels stealing the show. Cooked perfectly with a cream sauce, they would really make an unreal starter to any dish you paired with them. The pork belly however was overdone and a little bit tough and with the namesake of \"Butcher and the Rye\" I really thought this would be something that would steal the show. Maybe just an off night for the chef, but I was extremely disappointed.   The majority of the table ordered the Scallops with the Risotto and subsequently the majority of the table were extremely happy campers. The risotto was cooked absolutely perfectly, creamy and not too dense. The Scallops were seared to perfection on the outside with the inside remaining tender. A dish that is so easy to mess up seems to be mastered by the chefs at Butcher.   The whiskey wall is something that you need to see first hand, and the service was on par (nothing special, nothing that would ruin my time) with some of the other newer spots around the city. Overall a great spot that i would recommend to anyone looking for a great meal. I will most certainly be going back."}
{"text":"Very pleased with Butcher and the Rye! Made a reservation and you had the choice of communal seating or formal dining. When you walk in, the place seems small and tight but there are multiple sections on different levels. I felt Meat & Potatoes was very cramped but this layout was better. There are two bars, one upstairs and one down. It appears that you can eat your meal there and the bar upstairs was less crowded.   We ordered three appetizers. The focaccia came out very quickly with three spreads of olive tapenade, ricotta cream and white bean spread - all were very good. We had the Shisito peppers which were ok but I prefer the eones from Soba. Lastly, since we pigged out we had the pig candy which was very good and not super fatty.   For dinner we ordered the flank steak rare and it was cooked perfectly. We also ordered the dirty pasta and it was nice and rich. I did feel that the pasta was missing a little something so I took the leftovers home and added a little salt, pepper and a dash of hot sauce. I think that a squeeze of lemon may have even given it a light flavor."}
{"text":"I was really hoping to love this place but... eh.  Maybe it just wasn't the atmosphere I was looking for?  It is a super sexy and trendy restaurant, and man oh man was it packed full when we went.  We had a very small banquette table next to a big table of loud guys.  The service was adequate.  The music was loud.  The food was pretty good!  I loved the brussel sprouts.  Just not exactly a place for romance."}
{"text":"We decided to try butcher and the rye for restaurant week and we were not disappointed. For $35 we got a four course meal with relatively large portions. Needless to say we didn't leave hungry. Everything was delicious but the pig candy was by far the star of the meal! The Mac and cheese, frisée, and flank steak were also delectable. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place rocks. If you're really into great whiskey, burbon, and/or scotch, this is the place to go in pittsburgh, hands down. There is a wide variety of choices for novice enjoyment of different mash and there is also some stuff for those drinkers who like their burbon hot!!!! Plus, the food is fabulous. My favorite is the scallop dish that incorporates risotto with lemon zest, perfect."}
{"text":"If you are into whiskeys this place is the spot to go.  They have an unbelievable selection.  The bar tenders were knowlegeable about what they had and were able to make recommendations.  I really dug the large clear ice cube they used for on the rocks.  We were attended to by Giuseppe.  He was friendly and made an amazing old fashioned.  He engaged in great conversation and made the bar experience a good one.   This place had the coolest atmosphere of any place I had been to in Pittsburg.  The bathrooms were clean.  They have a cool upstairs bar and neat little nooks where they have seating.    The prices were fair and I didn't feel like I was paying inflated prices for the selection.  I didn't eat so I can't speak on the food but the guys sitting next to me ordered steak and it looked and smelled amazing.    Overall I would definately go back and I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere, service, and food. Definitely try the brussel sprouts and sourdough bread with pan drippings for appetizers and the peach pie for dessert!"}
{"text":"Mikey served us up some amazing drinks.  Even ran downstairs to put an order in for us before the kitchen closed.  This place is all class. Take your girl there, have Mikey surprise you with a drink of his choice, and leave feeling spiffy.  Music, atmosphere, service, all top notch.  Go."}
{"text":"Butcher is my absolute favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. The decoration is amazing, very chic yet casual atmosphere. I've been here several times and always take friends and family who are visiting here. My recommendations: pig wing, Brussel sprouts, Sunday gravy, and you MUST get the dirty pasta. It will be life changing. Their drinks are also top notch. Service is always impeccable. The prices are also very reasonable. Overall, it's a fantastic establishment serving new American cuisine that is cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"We love this restaurant and visited some few times. The taste of the food is wonderful and the service was great. But this last time we were surprised to hear that they didn't have not just one or two but MANY items listed on their website menu page (which we checked the same day) in the restaurant menu.  It is quite upsetting when restaurants do that. Because when you see something appealing to yourself, that kind of mindsets you on these dishes (particularly if you already had them and want to repeat the experience). When restaurants change the menu frequently some of them say on the web that it's just a sample of what you can see, but not the exect menu of the day. Some post the exect menu at the day of serving it. But at least a patron knows what to expect. I wish this fine establishment also would obtain this habit of clear exposure of changes to their day to day menu on their website. This way patron's frastration with unavailability of the items could be avoidable. Hope they pay attention on patron's thoughts."}
{"text":"The Brussels, Crispy octopus, and the Pig Candy were amazing appetizers that filled two men on the run to catch a show later that evening. We also had the Apple Cort that was smoky and had an awesome zestiness that paired so well with our appetizers. The atmosphere is very warm and inviting and the wait staff was more than helpful, specifically, bearded Cory who made more than recommendation that we took him up on and he nailed it. ( you gotta respect that beard-"}
{"text":"loved the food here. highly recommend people to visit this spot when they're in town! its a very busy place with a great vibe!"}
{"text":"The decor of Butcher and the Rye is really beautiful.  Probably one of the best designed places in Pittsburgh.  It's rustic yet hip and welcoming for dinner or just drinks at the bar.  I made a reservation for 5:30pm, totally forgot about the insanity of downtown traffic on a weekday and got there are 5:50.  The host was gracious and accommodating to this bump in the road.  The only odd thing was that as soon as I got there, the waiter asked me what I wanted to eat.  There were several empty tables around me that didn't get filled until our dining experience was over (around 7:30) so I didn't understand what the rush was.  Other than that oddity, our waiter was very pleasant.  I ordered the potato leek soup and the scallops entree.  My dining partner ordered the Monkfish \"Osso Bucco\".  I was very much impressed with the potato leek soup.  The soup was accompanied by cheesy tater tots, confit bacon and a cute thinly sliced piece of toast.  The plate came out only with the accompaniments on them as the servers beautifully poured the soup around it.  Fancy, huh?  And so delicious.  The confit bacon is really incredible.  If I had done some better thinking I would have ordered two soups and called it a night.  I ordered the scallops dished based on many reviews here that I've read on Yelp.  It definitely did not disappoint.  I was torn between this and the monkfish, but this was surely the more heartier dish.  The scallops, risotto, and asparagus were executed well but in general this dish did not wow me.  That's not to say that it wasn't delicious but for me a dish like this looses points for originality.  The flavors were pretty standard.  At the end of the meal I was pretty stuffed, but I'd love to come back for dessert (and more soup)."}
{"text":"Outstanding bourbon selection. Beet salad was very good. Mac and cheese was to die for. Burger was excellent and the scallops over crab risotto while a little on the salty side was still delicious. Setting was very cool and our waiter was great! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Amazing food & atmosphere!! My boyfriend and I have gone here many times for drinks but only once for dinner. Their drink selection is out of this world. The dinner was delicious & amazing and we are planning to go back for another date night. It was a bit pricey but well worth it!! The decor and low lighting make you feel like you're somewhere else - not in downtown PGH. You need to stop in and give this place a try!!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is decent -- decor is a mix of baroque & game hunting lodge, which sounds strange, but kind of works in a bizarre way.  Appetizers got me super excited because they were creative twists on staples... Brussel sprouts with a bit of sour cream was heavenly, crispy octopus was tasty, and shishito peppers was a creative delicious version vs how they're served in so many other places.  But then the big plates arrived and wow were they not nearly as impressive.  They weren't bad, but they weren't good.  Halibut was very dry, almost jerky-like with very few gnocchi.  Lamb neck was decent, although presentation was a bit daunting.  I had the marrow, which was okay, but I've had a lot better (portion was way too large and some of it was cold), and the tartare was downright salty... I love salty foods but couldn't even finish it.  I really wanted to love this place, but I ended up just liking it.  Will I be back?  Yes, but I won't be nearly as excited next time.  I will say, though, the drinks are AMAZING."}
{"text":"If you told me this place had a Michelin star, I would believe you. The small plates and the pasta that we ordered were out of this world. The atmosphere had a western feel with a modern twist. It was adorned with a deer antler chandelier, fun lights near the bar area, and wallpaper that went oddly well with the wood walls.  They also got rid of those weird bathroom stalls, so now you can go to the bathroom without having to make eye contact with the person who's washing their hands.  A few of my favorite plates here are the Pig Candy and the Dirty Pasta. The cocktails are good too, but don't get them if you're only into fruity/sweet drinks like I am.   Overall, 5/5 would recommend to a friend and will keep coming back."}
{"text":"The food blows... Whiskey over priced... Bartenders suck... Nuff said... Wont be back cracker jack"}
{"text":"Ok, so finally on a plane and have some time to catch up on writing reviews.  So my partner and I recently road tripped up to Lake Chautauqua New York to spend some time with family and realized that Pittsburgh was on the way.  Having never visited Pittsburgh we thought we'd stop off for a night and check it out.  What a great city!  We were totally blown away and this restaurant was a big part of it.  This joint really hits on all cylinders!  The staff was welcoming and friendly, the drinks were extremely well crafted and the food and table service were divine.  We started with old fashioned's and a \"bees knees\" at the bar and were seated quickly for our 9:00 reservation ( yes this place is that popular).  We decided to stick to small plates and were rewarded handsomely!  The standouts from dinner were the brussel sprouts, steak tartare, and the \"pig candy\" (pork belly).  The brussel sprouts were crispy fried and absolutely drenched in butter and Parmesan cheese and the tartare was properly finished with an egg yolk.  The pork belly was decadent and not lost in the glaze that it was prepared in which was nice.  We were not disappointed by the wine list and truly had a wonderful evening here.  If you find yourself way out that way, check it out and eat up y'all!"}
{"text":"I dined here tonight and I would say the food is excellent, ambiance excellent and service terrible.  Our waitress Melissa put a real damper on our experience and it's been a while since I had such bad service.  When we sat down I asked if I could have lemons and a straw and they never came.  I had to get up and get it myself from the bar because I was do thirsty. We ordered drinks and they came after appetizers.  My friend ordered Chardonnay and my friend asked her where it was after we got our drinks and the way she answered my friend was really offensive and appalling.  She gave my friend a tremendous attitude and said \"I brought you the end of the bottle there in that glass, and I am going to take care of the rest of my section and after that I'll bring you more\". We looked at the glass had a few sips in it.  Then she brought her the rest and it was a different Chardonnay than what she brought in the first glass (the end if the bottle). It was yellow tail.  Then my friend got a 2nd glass and she brought a different Chardonnay again.  I've never ordered wine and had a waitress bring 3 different types of Chardonnay to 1 person.  She didn't check on us during our meal.  She was rude and unfortunately made it a bad experience.  The food tasted good.  It's a cute restaurant.  What a shame."}
{"text":"We went here on the 4th of July.  It was pretty good.  The restaurant was packed.  The food was all tasty, but I think my expectations might have been too high.  My parents raved about the burger, so we split that for 18$ along with some of the more creative sounding sides, such as octopus, bread with pan drippings, and others that I have forgotten.  The burger was only ok.  I feel like 18$ is setting a pretty high bar.  I would definitely order something different next time.  The service was great - super efficient.  Everything was definitely good.  The restaurant is super trendy - I loved the art on the tables.  I don't know if I would come back as I am definitely in the Meat and Potatoes camp."}
{"text":"Thank God for Yelp!!!  In town on business and found this gem.  Walked over from my hotel on a Thursday night to find the place very busy but was able to score a spot at the bar.  Had an excellent Manhatten followed by on of the best Waygu burgers I've ever had, complete with some righteous fries.   While waiting for my burger, everything I saw coming out of the kitchen looked great.  Make sure to eat here!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Great service with a sense of humor. Ask for Jenna. Get the scallops, mussels and foie gras."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place, as a lover of quality dining and an impassioned imbiber of all things bourbon.  The reviews and word-of-mouth had reeled me in with promises that, sadly, may have worked against the actual experience.  My review is a combination.  In terms of atmosphere and cocktails, I'd go with a 4-star experience.  I loved the drinks and the fact they attempt to keep it seasonal, and the overstuffed chairs in our top level seating, overlooking the massive wall of whiskey, added to the cool vibe (think dimly lit hipster lodge).  The waitress was attentive, but almost too much so.  I realize it's difficult to get reservations unless you plan ahead, so clearly they're busy, but it felt like she wanted us in and out as quickly as possible.  She wasn't overtly rude, but it's just the impression I was left with.  Then comes the food.  This is where I'd give only 2 stars.  We tried the mac and cheese app (not my choice, but in a marriage, all things are compromise, even appalling appetizer decisions at an expensive restaurant).  It was, by all accounts, mac and cheese.  Nothing at all special about it, other than the four cheeses.  But seriously, whose mac and cheese recipe doesn't call for multiple cheeses?  Not impressed.  Then came the pasta and fish entrees.  My better half liked the pasta and was satisfied, because of course the base of the dish is a starch.  For the tiny piece of fish I received, and the two gnocchi and small \"pile\" of greens that comprised the sides to round out the $30 entree, I left still feeling like I'd just had a snack before the real dinner.  I'm well versed in how different price to portion is in a restaurant that values quality over quantity, as opposed to the gluttony of food you get in a chain restaurant.  That being said, this stretched that way too much.  I'm fine with not feeling \"full\"...a good meal should make you feel satisfied, not weighed down.  But to still feel hungry is another story.    Long story short, I'd definitely go back for snacks and cocktails again in the future, but there are better restaurants in town at the same price point when it comes to the actual meal."}
{"text":"I've liked it every time, but we did the Restaurant Week Pre fixe this week and it was a-mazing. I don't remember everything that was in it, but there was this deconstructed grilled cheese and tomato soup where the little sandwich had some kind of pancetta and the tomato soup was made with green tomatoes and duck fat. So good."}
{"text":"I was really excited about this place before walking in because Butcher and the Rye is really hard to get a reservation.   FOOD - I had mussels, marrow, pig candy, duck liver pate, and wagyu flank steak. The portions were good, price were good, and everything tasted good. Though we ordered our steak medium rare, it seemed a little overcooked and asked them to make it again for us, which was again a little overcooked. Overall, other than the duck liver pate, everything was mediocre.  SERVICE - service was excellent!  ENVIRONMENT -  I liked the vibe of the place, and it would be a great place to grab a drink and eat appetizers. It won't be a good place to bring kids or for a large group of people.  I gave three stars to the place because although there was nothing that bothered me, they weren't excellent. I probably will not come back here and rather go to Meat and Potatoes."}
{"text":"I went here on a surprise Tuesday dinner date with my boyfriend. Everything was outstanding!! The food was definitely made with love. I had a filet mignon cooked to a perfect medium rare with sauce that made me want to lick every drop of it off of my plate. My boyfriend had rabbit and dumplings. The rabbit was extremely moist and the sauce was fantastic. We split the carrot cake for dessert. Both of us aren't big dessert eaters, but we both enjoyed and devoured the whole cake. Absolutely enjoyed everything about this restaurant."}
{"text":"Once you get past the initial hipster vibe, you're actually in for quite the experience here. The staff is Pittsburgh friendly and super accommodating. As for the food and drink, it lives up to the Yelp rating - very high quality. I found the drink selection to be very interesting and have a great variety - they even feature a couple of barrel aged cocktails. I had 3 small dishes and all were of generous portion and amazing quality. Of particular note - their Dry Aged Tartare was superb, and ranks among the best beef tartare I have ever had."}
{"text":"Just went here for drinks and appetizers but had a 5 star experience. The butcher club cocktail was oh so delicious and the beer list was fantastic. We got the pork candy which was amazing - bursting with incredible flavors and also their very expensive homemade charcuterie platter. It was worth it! The meats were unique and flavorful.  The menu overall looked fantastic and I would go back here for more drinks and a meal! Great experience!"}
{"text":"Best Brussels sprouts I've ever had. Mac and cheese was to die for. Definitely think small plates is the way to go here. Shishito peppers are so-so. Service was just okay. Bartenders are awesome - the Naughty Mule was delicious and had the perfect kick with the jalapeño."}
{"text":"This is our favorite restaurant in the city. Everything about it is perfect, from the beautiful, woodsy decor to the amazing display selection of the whiskey bar and most of all, the FOOD.  We came here for Valentine's Day, not that we ever have trouble finding an excuse to come here. We were seated upstairs (there is a bar area, communal tables and seating downstairs, and more seating and another, more secluded bar upstairs). Note that some tables upstairs are very close together, but we weren't seated at those tables.  Our waitress was extremely attentive, always refilling water and making sure we were ok. I ordered the Wild Kind cocktail, which was a bourbon cocktail that was a great blend of sour and smokey. But honestly, I've never had a cocktail here that I didn't love. The cocktail menu is always changing, and it's always super creative.  We ordered the gnudi (special for V day) and the brussel sprouts to start. The gnudi was light and decadent, and the brussel sprouts were perfectly roasted with just the right amount of lemon and presented with a delicious lemon aioli.  For dinner, we got the scallops with blue crab risotto and the rainbow trout with anchovy vinaigrette. I dream about this risotto. The scallops are always perfectly seared and so buttery (texture wise), and the risotto is so heavenly every single time. It is my FAVORITE meal in Pittsburgh. The rainbow trout was also delicious, perfectly seared as well, and the anchovy vinaigrette definitely added something different. Delicious.  For dessert, we got the amaretto cheesecake (on special for V day). Everything on this plate was perfection, from the luxardo cherries oozing with flavor to the light, fluffy cheesecake to the lightly toasted marshmallows and the sorbet.  Honestly, if I could eat the scallops with blue crab risotto every day, I would be the happiest person on the planet. I love Butcher so much, from the service to the food to the ambiance."}
{"text":"Our table had some delectable burgers at Butcher and Rye. However, there were a few downsides to the evening. First, they have a variety of different seating. The section that we were placed in had a banquet on one side and a small stool of the other side. I was so uncomfortable sitting on a stool with no back and that was too low for my longer legs. The area could have been designed to be appropriately comfortable, but perhaps not as edgy-looking. Second, when a busboy was cleaning off a table next to us, he sprayed cleaning product in our direction. I could see it misting my food and drink. Luckily, I was a few bites away from done because that was the end of the meal for me. Hopefully, someone in charge will read this and instruct their staff to spray their cloth while turning away from diners and then wipe down tables, in order to avoid lemon-chemical-coated entrees."}
{"text":"Add this place to your bucket list.  Service was great, the bartender was like an artist with drinks, and the food was amazing.  We came into town for the game and couldn't get reservations, but did get a seat at the bar.  Everything was perfect and I will make sure we get reservations next time we're in town.  The wife loved it as well and wants to return for a full blown experience.    BTW - we got there exactly as it opened to secure a bar seat and within 20 minutes, the place was packed."}
{"text":"A friend of ours has a son that's a chef here, so after many conversations about this place, we had the opportunity to visit Pittsburgh and try it out. As a chef myself, it's hard to go out to eat because you can't help but critic everything; from front of the house to food, everything. You don't want to, but it just happens. Let me say....everything, from beginning to end was phenomenal!! The food!!! Oh my goodness!!! I was in food heaven for over an hour!!! Pure food porn too!!....I'll post some pictures of our dinner, but every dish was incredible! What a treat for another chef!!!! Thank you Chef Drew!!! Keep up the fabulous work!!! Your love for what you do shows in each dish!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My one and only dining experience in Pittsburgh was AMAZING! The decor of this place is simply astounding. My friend and I took turns pointing out eccentric decor pieces to each other & there are so many!   The servers were so incredibly nice and in that genuine, non-snooty way. It was so refreshing compared to what I have to deal with in NYC.  Now, for the food. The brussel sprouts were great. Top notch. Loved them and I don't like brussel sprouts (at least not before). It comes in a huge bowl with a huge mountain of shredded cheese.   The marrow was very buttery and smooth and fatty which I think makes it good marrow. I wasn't really sure what I was getting myself into ordering that marrow but I thought it would be fun. Beware if you don't want a tablespoon full of pure fat. It was adorned with parsley and capers which I slid right off. I didn't care too much for the combination of flavors. Oxtail jam served atop two pieces of bread also accompanied the marrow which both my friend and I thought was the winner of the dish. You should eat that first because if not the juice from the oxtail jam will make the bread soggy.  The pork belly dish was divine but that's probably because it was very Vietnamese-like and I love Vietnamese food. Some of the pork belly meat was a bit chewy though. It came with pickled carrots and daikon (?) which you would normally see in a banh mi. And I'm pretty sure I tasted a hint of fish sauce on the pork belly.  The burger comes with fries (which were not that great). While we ordered it medium rare (as recommended), it came out medium well. Odd, but okay. The buns were unfortunately not toasted (sad face).   I would recommend the brussel sprouts & pork belly but try dishes other than the marrow and burger to complete your meal!"}
{"text":"Excellent meal and service! My halibut was delicious! Creative cocktails, wonderfully seasoned food and a hip vibe! Only took off a star because they were out of several items on the menu. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I came here based on the yelp reviews. BOY was i not disapointed!!!! First off I used the yelp app to make reservations a few days in advance and boy was it easy! I made the first available on a friday night and they confirmed the reservation the day before. I walked in and didn't even have to wait!  As soon as i walked in, I was amazed at the atmosphere. It was swanky and sexy. I ended up sitting in the second floor area. Only complaint is that it is a little crowded but hey at least I was able to peruse the other patrons meals as I waited for mine.   Our server was a great. She was acknowledgeable on all the drinks and entrees. I was pleased with all the things that I did order. We got a few of the regular menu items and some from the specials menu.  Ordered the crispy octopus, the tortellini, strip steak, marrow, and the beet salad. The only thing that I didn't really care for was the tortellini but everything else was tasty and well plated.   Our waitress was great with food/drink recommendations and they brought out all the dishes in a very perfunctory manner so that nothing overlapped.   Service was as swanky as the eclectic vibe in the place. Wish I had more time to sit at the bar and people watch!!"}
{"text":"Finally tried this place out after several failed attempt to book dinner at a reasonable time (I live in NY so I consider 9pm reasonable still and had difficulties trying to book on the day and finally the cold weather worked in my favor).  Based on the raves and pricing I would say it delivered as expected, and perhaps I new to come back and try more dishes before I update my rating.  It actually is somewhere around 3.5 stars.  Nice decor definitely had an identity to it.  I tried the skirt steak with fried egg, long beans, rice cake in chilli sauce.  Those of us familiar with Bibimbop will understand me if I say the favoring is very similar.  Instead of rice you get fried Korean rice cakes.  The rice cake retained the chewy characteristics expected except the outside was now a little hard and while I generally like fried stuff I expected it to be a bit more crunchy and perhaps this is a preference but I would almost say if it cannot be crunchy, then better leave it be (chewy).  The one I had was half way in between so it didn't really do it for me.  Skirt steak was very nicely done, I did find the dish in general was slightly sweet to taste, with the streak marinate and sauce.  I had the beer battered peanut butter chocolate brownie with bittersweet chocolate sorbet and peanut praline.  Moist brownie - checked.  Crispy wafer - checked.  Candied peanut praline - crunchy goodness big check.  What I actually liked a lot was the bittersweet chocolate sorbet.  So dessert alone I am happy to give it 4 stars and it is big enough to share between 2.  It is very delicious but quite heavy."}
{"text":"Great meal with fantastic food and drinks. Will definitely return. Only one hiccup with meal progression, appetizer came out with one of two salads, second salad came later, drinks were slow. However, even this could not ruin the delicious food and friendly waiter."}
{"text":"I came here in March of last year and have been dreaming of the bone marrow ever since. It was every bit as incredible as I remembered. The ambiance is really fun and their drink menu is killer.  Bone marrow is HIGHLY recommended, as well as the pig candy and tartare.   Definitely a must visit while in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Great drinks, lamb appetizer was great! Would have gotten 5 stars except for the bathrooms which are insulting: might as well be in Indonesia with a room of drains on the floor!"}
{"text":"Came here after a conference for dinner. Very happy I did! I ordered the hangar steak with mashed potatoes and burnt broccoli. Best decision! Steak was perfectly cooked and the sauces for garnish nicely complemented the meal. Also,  I ordered the mac and cheese,  one word: amazing! Probably the best I've ever had. I also tried the bread with drippings and I have to say the drippings were a delicious gravy like dip that had a great depth of flavor.   Highly recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Fantastic is the only word that comes to mind when thinking about how to describe this place.   From the food selections to the service, everything is top notch. The space is so unique and inviting, it makes you feel like you're going to your grandmothers home for dinner. That is - if your grandmother has a full house of friends on any given night of the week.   Don't get me wrong, it's not like your grandmother has a full house of people all the time, as I went on a Thursday night and the place was standing room only. Perhaps the best thing about the restaurant is the amazing range of foodstuffs. There is something for every palette on the menu.  I sat at the bar and had a fantastic burger with the starter cauliflower dish that rocked my world. The drink menu, including the selection of beers, both bottle and on tap, is truly unique. They even they even had an Oregon Pinot Noir wine by the glass.   I've now found my new favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant - delicious small plates and drink choices. Service is exceptional and speedy. Need to make reservations in advance! Highly recommend making room for dessert."}
{"text":"We ended up here for dessert. We were seated right away. The place has a cool atmosphere and vibe. Dessert was delicious. We will definitely be back for dinner."}
{"text":"3.5 review.   I had been looking forward to coming here for a while, and was so excited when a reservation opened up.   I'll start with the good things! The drinks were delicious (solid 4), the brussels sprouts and lemon aioli were amazing (5 stars), and the beet salad was good with the goat cheese balls being an awesome touch (4 stars).   Unfortunately I did not like my main dish, the ricotta and charred carrot cavatelli with veal, peas, and hazelnut. In my opinion, the flavors did not work well together. The pasta was slightly overcooked and pea flavor consumed the dish.   The service could also be improved. The waiter was not very friendly or informative. The entire upstairs was open and yet we ended up sitting right on top of another group. I don't mind crowded places, but when the upstairs was so open, it was hard to focus on something other than the neighboring conversation. The woman who brought out our pasta to the table apologized for the \"mixup with the dish\", but we weren't aware of this mixup so we were confused.  While it wasn't a completely unpleasant experience, I'd much rather go back to their sister restaurant, Meat and Potatoes."}
{"text":"Somehow it took me forever to come here. Granted, it is much easier to get a reservation at a reasonable time than it used to be.  Service was fantastic! Food was pretty solid, although both of our meals were a bit over seasoned. Prices aren't too ridiculous for what you're getting. Upstairs is LOUD.  Altogether a 3.89 stars experience."}
{"text":"Really awesome dinner last night at Butcher and the Rye. We easily booked a table via Yelp shortly before the restaurant opened, walked right in and sat down. Reservations seemed key as the restaurant filled up pretty quickly. They have a great drink list but we settled on tasty IPAs and later some bourbon for \"dessert\". We enjoyed the Sunday Gravy, Scallops and Dirty Pasta. Our waiter, Julian, was fantastic! Not only did he keep our drinks full, he recommended meals, our dessert bourbon AND ran outside in the rain to give us our parking ticket that fell under the table. Not going to find service like that everywhere you guys."}
{"text":"First time here. The restaurant itself is very cool, lots of cool decor to look at. It was a packed for a Tuesday! Good thing we made reservations. We started off with the brussel sprouts and the fried octopus. Both were very yummy. The portions were totally different. Lots of sprouts vs two small pieces of octopus. For dinner I had the dirty pasta which was one of the best meals I have had out in a while! A big portion with ground duck and the pasta tasted fresh made. My boyfriend got the trout which he really enjoyed. It was served with roasted potatoes and tomatoes. My only complaints were the very crammed seating and a broken door stall in the women's bathroom that was propped up against the wall. Really?"}
{"text":"Wavering between a 3 and 3.5, I chose to round down because it was ok but didn't quite live up to my expectations. I've had some new American dining experiences in L.A. and Chicago that were amazing and I was hoping that Pittsburgh would prove that it could stand up with the big boys. We started with the sourdough and it wasn't sour nor was the crust crunchy enough for my preference. Next was the charcuterie board. I was quite pleased with the assortment of meats and pickled vegetables. I think there were 6 different types so it was quite enough for two. Nothing groundbreaking but I was satisfied nonetheless.  What I was most disappointed with was the mussels. At first taste, it had a bit if a pungent smell and I wasn't sure if it was a fishy smell or because of the seasoning. I just wasn't into the weird spices sprinkled on the mussels and I didn't care for the broth flavoring and the chickpeas. It was an interesting combination of flavors but it just wasn't for me.  The service was good and no complaints about that. Drinks were good too. I was just hoping the food would have been a little more memorable."}
{"text":"We had a reservation for 5:00. We showed up a few minutes late, because we couldn't find parking with a high enough clearance for the truck. We were worried that we were going to lose our table, but the staff didn't seem to mind. It might have been because they don't open until 5, so it wasn't busy yet. The service was very slow, and the tables were too close, but we didn't even care because the food and drinks were so good! We also had plenty to look at throughout the restaurant, and the staff was extremely pleasant! We weren't sure what to order, so we just got the special (shown in picture). I couldn't believe soup could taste that good! I could have eaten only the soup as my meal and would have been happy. The entree was really good too, but the desert was bland. We don't usually order dessert, and were pretty full by the time it came out anyway, though."}
{"text":"Worth the wait it took to get a reservation.  I really enjoyed the food and I ate outside my comfort zone and I was more than pleased.  Great atmosphere and service staff - 100% must go to restaurant."}
{"text":"Stopped here for dinner with friends.   Naomi our server was great.  Food was outstanding.   Cocktail menu is interesting and drinks are well exicutied.   I would recommend."}
{"text":"I have been here a handful of times over the past couple years, and Butcher has yet to disappoint! You cannot beat the ambiance, it's dark, transitional design provides an almost eery setting, but the music, lighting, and full on energy in here makes it incredibly lively.   The fried brussels will change your life, and the Moscow mules are one of the best I've found in the Burgh. If you're a whiskey drinker though, this place is surely for you. The wall behind the bar is stacked with dark liquor for two stories, complete with an old school wooden ladder on casters so they can access any kind at any time."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh for sure. I love all of the small plates. Definitely try the pig candy, you will not be disappointed. You will enjoy everything you try."}
{"text":"Yelp researched the best restaurants in Pittsburgh and Butcher and the Rye was on the top of the list. With 4.5 stars and over 600 reviews, I knew I had to give them a try during my 3 day stay. Added Yelp bonus: Their reservation system is through Yelp, woo!   AMBIANCE: Low lighting, mounted animals, and antler chandeliers.... oh my!   SERVICE: We arrived a little early and our table \"wasn't quite ready yet\". No problem, there are multiple Pokestops nearby to hit up (judge me). Our waiter (dangit, I forgot his name) was great! Very friendly and personable and checked on us frequently. We made it halfway through our entrees when we got a phone call from our hotel for a noise complaint on our dogs. Unfortunately, we had to cut our dining experience short and our waiter speedily boxed our leftovers and expedited the bill process. We definitely appreciated this!   FOOD: Winner, winner, duck dinner! Omg, the Dirty Pasta was sooooo good. We perused other Yelper's pictures that captioned the Dirty Pasta as \"their last meal on Earth\"... I'm thinking \"yeah, right, stop, so dramatic\". Um, yeah, no... SERIOUSLY SO GOOD. Salty, slightly sweet, herbaceous, meaty, cheesy. DO IT! The brussels are also really good, very charred and covered in parmigiano reggiano. I've never had brussels with dill and it was definitely a unique twist.   DRANKS: Kentucky Tea Party Punch was visually stunning and equally tasty. The cup was beautifully topped with a mint garnish and paired great with the Pimms and Jim. If you're interested to know what a hellfire shrub tastes like, then order the Wild Kind. I'm sure one could guess, but do it. I dare you.   Overall, great meal, great time, wish we could have stayed longer! So sad I missed out on the Bramble cocktail and Peaches n' Cream Doughnuts :( :( :( :( :("}
{"text":"Wow, I am surprised. But I have to give 5 where it's due.   We were walk ins on a Friday night but found space at the bar.   We had drinks and small bites. The drinks were 100% and the found was 100% as well.   The bartender was the only downside. He quite absent mindedly seemed to mix our drinks and handed them to us without even making eye contact while continuing a loud and obnoxious competitive \"conversation\" with another patron.   But because the drinks and food were so good I will still give a 5.   The small bites were fried octopus, duck liver pate, fried cauliflower and a pig wing (mini pig shank).   Each item was 100%. I really was surprised. It's not often you hit 4/4 on a menu like that.   I could eat those pig wings all day!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service.  Had a late Saturday night dinner reservation and the place was still swinging.  Terrific drinks and the waiter handled my food restrictions extremely well.  Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Ideally, I'd give this place 4.5 stars, but we'll go crazy and round up :-)  We made a reservation and due to some downtown traffic, we were running late.  We called and they were nothing but understanding and able to hold our table for us.  We started with splitting the beet salad, which was amazing.  I loved the combination of fennel, beets, and goat cheese croutons.  The blood orange vinaigrette melded all of the flavors together and left you with a bright, crunchy, refreshing start to the meal.  I had the \"Vesper\" to drink.  It reminded me of a mild lemon drop martini, not overly flavored. It was very good, but I'm not sure I'd ever crave that or list it as my favorite drink.  For my entree, I ordered the \"Dirty Pasta\".  The noodles reminded me of an elongated cavatelli in a savory, cheese sauce with ground duck, sage and plenty of Parmesan Reggiano on top.  The portion was more than enough, and I even had a small portion left over for lunch the next day!  My dining partner got the hanger steak.  It was cooked perfectly, amazingly tender for a hanger steak.  Our only issue was the meat was a little over-salted, but that is likely more our preference.  The ambiance was very hipster-y, with dark, patterned wallpapers and a big, standing, stuffed bear adjacent to our table.  It was a little dark inside.  If you're dining with older guests, maybe bring along your flashlight to help them out!  My only disappointment was not having any room for dessert!  Next time, I'm saving belly room all day in order to eat more here!"}
{"text":"I travel extensively to big cities like New York, London, Dubai, Singapore - so it's sometimes hard to get excited about the local food scene.  Last night we had a super meal at Butcher, one that would have impressed me anywhere.   Nice to see such an addition to \"The Burgh\".    The place is visually beautiful.   Service was terrific.   Of course, it all comes down to the food.    Several dishes were spectacular (brussels sprouts (it's true), shishito peppers, crispy pork wings, pig candy, pot de creme dessert).   A few were very good (burrata, pork marrow).   The mussels and focaccia were good (but nothing special).   Only the peach pie dessert was below average - only because the crust tasted like it was deep fried in the same shortening (oil) vat with a variety of other foods.   You should definitely put this on your culinary \"to do\" list.   We'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Love this place. Expensive but good. Great for after symphony or a special date night. The bar alone is worth visiting but the hearty and rustic feel of the food and vib make it one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh. Ascetically beautiful and unique, I could take pictures of this restaurant all day."}
{"text":"Been DYING to try Butcher and the Rye, as I LOVE Meat & Potatoes, and I walk by here every day on my way to and from work, and it's always packed.  So we stopped in the other night after a Pirates game, and surprisingly there was no wait, which was awesome.  The inside of the restaurant is super cool.. seriously, love.  We got our menus when we sat, and maybe it just wasn't what we were in the mood for at that time, but we were just not overly impressed with the menu.  We only ordered an appetizer (filled up on beer and junk food during the game, of course) and by suggestion of our server we ordered the Sunday Gravy, which I'll admit was pretty fantastic.  I would have never chosen this particular dish on my own, because I just think little lambs are too cuddly and cute to be eaten- however, that night I through all emotional attachment I have to farm animal babies out the window, and I showed that Sunday Gravy who was boss.  It was that good.    With that said, we finished our little lamb dish and called it a night.  I wont say that I'll never go back, because that wouldn't be fair.  I will say, though, that I'll know for next time what to expect, and be sure that I've got the right appetite-mood going next time I go."}
{"text":"All I really have to say is the hype is real. Indescribably delicious. Every dish. We had the scallops, dirty pasta and chicken. Also the cheeseboard, Brussels and almond cake for dessert. I want to eat it all over again. Everything honestly tasted amazing I don't think you can have a bad dish here.  Just go here."}
{"text":"Probably the best bar in America! Amazing bartenders...and my gawd if you like brown liquor, buckle up!"}
{"text":"Amazing. From the dimly lit chandelier and old fashioned wallpaper to the scrolls rolled down to feature the specials, to the knives and cleavers hanging near the entrance, to the cleaver draft handles, down to the ladder behind the bar to access numerous bourbons and scotches ... the speakeasy-lodge atmosphere just works. Rustic, hip, trendy yet timeless all in one. We sat at the bar on a Saturday night, and Allison was a terrific bartender. She was friendly, attentive, knowledgeable and made our first experience here great! Every cocktail we tried was fresh, balanced, and creative yet classic. She offered us a list of the available bourbons also, which was nice to browse through.  The food we tried was delicious. We decided to try some new things we've never had before, the main one being bone marrow! (Alison helped convince us to try it!) We both enjoyed it- buttery texture with the sea salt, on top of oxtail jam- very interesting yet yummy. I would get it again and look forward to trying bone marrow at other places now that I know I like it. We also got the pig candy. You must try this here! Sweet, salty, and lick-the-plate delicious. We also got the dry aged tartare plate - and were very pleased ... So many flavors combined together.  Next time we are in Pittsburgh we will make sure to go back and make reservations- or hope to get lucky and sit at the bar and have Allison as our bartender again!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere - super-cool, a little quirky, funky vibe, LOUD. Not the place to go for romance but definitely a place to go to impress your guest with your hip-factor. The two-tops are those teeny marble cafe tables like they have at Meat and Potatoes and I just do NOT get it for a small-plates restaurant that also serves whiskey flights - there's no room for anything on the table. Also really, really dark, we needed our iPhone flashlights to see the menu. Cocktails - excellent. I tried a Butcher Sour and a Manhattan and both were lovely, wonderfully balanced drinks."}
{"text":"I've been to the sister restaurant, Meat and Potatoes but love Butcher and the Rye even more. Sat at the bar and felt well taken care of.  The atmosphere is relaxing and hip and the staff friendly and helpful. Also had the bone marrow with cocktails. Looking forward to exploring the menu here."}
{"text":"I ate here last thursday night, and it was a great experience.  Late dinner (9pm) meant the decibel/music level steadily rose as we ate, but my mom's a trooper/badass (made me leave the waitress the digits) so it worked out well.  I had the sugo pasta and she had the halibut.  My dish was hearty and incredibly flavorful, while hers was milder but had a great combination of flavors.   As far as drinks go, I had one of the most alcoholic I've ever had - the morning glory - and although it was delicious, I felt like after a couple sips I'd be capable of breathing fireballs...that's what bourbon, absinthe, cognac, and champagne in one glass will do for ya.  We ended with the cheese plate, and that confirmed that Butch & Rye is a place I'll have to come back to!"}
{"text":"Butcher and the Rye is redefining Pittsburgh as a city to be reckoned with. No attention to detail has been spared on this establishment. From floor to ceiling a passion is at work and the result is a world class restaurant worthy of a visit from the finest chefs and restauranteurs on the globe and its located right here in downtown Pittsburgh for all of you epicurean yinzers and visiting out-of-tahners alike! There are more than 300 varieties of bourbon on wall and with dishes like candied pig wings, monk fish over crab risotto, pig Kim-Chee, Kale Caesar with anchovy toast, duck pâté, lamb neck with Sunday gravy and a deluge of other delectable dining decisions to decide upon, you'd be  a big dummy not to do dinner here. Go there. Do this..."}
{"text":"No way Jose!! This negative experience pushed me to write my very first yelp review. I have been coming to Pittsburgh once or twice a year for work for a decade---I love this town and its awesome restaurant scene. After a long day of work on this cold winter night all I wanted to do was grab some good food and go back to my cozy warm hotel room. I have never been to this restaurant before but have heard and read good things and wanted to try it this visit....however, upon arriving I was informed that they do not accommodate take-way orders. The arrogance and audacity of this chef are amazing---not just for Pittsburgh but for any city! I will never set foot in this restaurant and will tell everyone I know about this appalling customer service. Spend your money at any of the other amazing Pittsburgh restaurants that appreciate and accommodate their guests and don't turn them away. Sad. I would not give this restaurant even 1 star but u have to in order to leave a review."}
{"text":"We ate dinner here before the Pirates game. The place is unique, casual and eclectic. Certainly a place to dress up for date night, or wear casual clothes and just relax. The food is amazing. We had fried zucchini bread, which was a nice mix between savory and sweet for an appetizer. Had the Brussels sprouts -excellent, chicken - perfect skin and the duxelles were out of this world. The real stars - which were crazy good was the mac n cheese as well as the shishito peppers. Get the peppers - the depth of flavor and just a hint of heat will want you wanting more!"}
{"text":"I come here for one thing and one thing only. The cocktails. They are unbelievable and by far the best I've had in Pittsburgh. Drinks are a bit pricey but it is money well spent. My go-to is the Kentucky Tea Party Punch, but I haven't had a bad one yet.   Bonus: They have more whiskey, bourbon, and rye than you can imagine.   Pro tip: If you walk in and there's no seats at the bar, there's a second bar upstairs that most people don't know about.   Cheers!"}
{"text":"Oh god, so good. Clearly a younger restaurant, but the food is wonderful  I got the waygu flank steak, just a perfect steak, not too salty, a ton of flavor.   We'll be back."}
{"text":"One of, if not my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh.    Mushroom soup and dirty pasta are my go-to dishes.  Plus, if you're a whiskey drinker you can't help but be mesmerized by their wall of booze"}
{"text":"My review is going to echo a lot of the others.  The food was incredible but the service was not.  We went to celebrate a birthday and made reservations for a weeknight.  Our reservation was for an hour after opening.  When we arrived there were very few people in the restaurant.  The host seemed very irritated that we walked in and didn't greet us.  I told him that we had a reservation, he grabbed 2 menus and told us to follow him.  He took us upstairs to a tiny table right up against another table of diners.  There were probably 3 tables taken at this point.  Sitting there would have put my back against the woman at the other table.  I didn't want to be uncomfortable while we were eating so I asked for another table.  He seemed irritated and then showed us to another table.  I will say that the new table was nice - in a private spot and had plenty of room.  Our waiter was fine but didn't blow us away.  The food was exceptional and would be the only reason that we would ever return here."}
{"text":"The food was good but nothing exceptional.  The atmosphere is more focused on being trendy than functional.  The tables are too small for a small party and I was almost on top of other customers.  My husband and I had to have our first table moved because they expected us to have dinner at what was a cocktail table.  We felt very claustrophobic through the entire dinner."}
{"text":"Rustic bohemian hipster whiskey bar with impeccable beverage, food and plates. I ordered the beef tartare, which I may or may not have licked the plate clean of its black garlic aioli. Ok,I didn't lick the plate, but I did swipe the remnants of faultless deliciousness clean with my finger. No shame. I ordered several drinks at the bar; each one as good as the next. Highly recommended if you're into badass sexy food, whiskey and super chill places."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of dining there this past weekend. It was quite an experience. The restaurant decor was very interesting... I found myself looking around the whole time. I was in a party of four and our waitress was great. Everyone in my party order a whiskey drink... Not a big whiskey fan but each person loved their drink... We each ordered a different small plate. We ordered the rabbit perogies... Which were absolutely delicious and so was the beef stroganoff. I must say I would definitely come back and try some of the other plates!"}
{"text":"I've only been here once thus far but my experience was stellar. My wife and I were having an evening in the city and when we were unable to get into the restaurant we originally intended to dine at that evening due to an unexpected crowd and a lack of reservations, we managed to slide into Butcher & the Rye as they opened for the evening. We lacked a reservation and we could only get bar seats, but they were quite sufficient. We sat at the upstairs bar and the bartenders were knowledgeable and skilled, preparing some of the best mixed drinks I've had in the city (or anywhere, for the matter), and they were also among the friendliest bartenders I've had anywhere. My wife and I had burgers which were admittedly on the lower end of their price range because we hadn't really intended on anything higher-scale for the evening, but their burgers were excellent, fries were above-average and the service was wonderful.  I fully intend to return here multiple times to sample their higher-end fare as my first impromptu experience with them was wonderful and may possibly be the best first impression I've had with dining establishments in the city.  The only downside I can really rate them on is their hours, as they seem to be rather limited. If you want to dine there I strongly suggest planning ahead and making reservations; I get the succinct feeling I was lucky to squeeze in when I did the night I was there.  Update: went back for my birthday and was not disappointed. Everything we had was delicious and service was superb."}
{"text":"Just had drinks and snacks here tonight. Absolutely fantastic. Cocktails are top notch and the bourbon list is extensive. Even though they were crazy busy we were able to snag a table no problem. Service was very friendly, again despite the insanely busy Saturday night. The \"rice cake\" is one of the more creative dishes I have had on a long time. Mac & cheese is delicious as well. Go there immediately."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times with my husband on date night.  I have been putting off reviewing it for a while for two reasons--because we usually just stop for drinks, and also because there aren't many food options for me.  Last time we stopped, we grabbed a seat at the bar for dinner.  I had the mussels and they were good (not point brugge good though), and my husband got the burger--which he deemed one of the best he'd ever eaten.  Obviously the big draw here is the bar - and the cocktails in particular.  Sometimes I just get the punch, but I will usually order a bourbon drink and they're definitely some of the best ever.  They also have a small selection of great beers on tap if that's your thing. It's usually mine but I can't see past the wall o' bourbon!  I would definitely recommend it for a date night, but make reservations if you want to do dinner."}
{"text":"This place is excellent and would highly recommend to everyone, whether you are a whisky lover or not. If you like whiskey, this is by far the best. Had some rare whiskeys that could hardly ever find. The food and the customer service was amazing as well. If the food is not up to standard, Ricardo, who I am assuming is a manager, will immediately correct it and ensure you leave with a full stomach and a superb experience."}
{"text":"I stopped by here this past Saturday evening with my fiancé and 2 other dining companions for dinner.  Upon entering Butcher and the Rye I was sort of surprised by the décor but also thought that it was pretty cool with the first thing catching my eye the large and tall displays of Whiskey behind the bar.  Since we arrived about 5 minutes after our reservation time (crazy theater traffic) we were immediately shown to our table and I didn't get to see as much downstairs as I would have liked.  As we headed up the first set of stairs I thought it was cool that they had a couple of different levels and then we headed up to a third level which had a bar and some lounge type seating.  We ended up being sat in the lounge type seating which meant that my fiancé and I were stuck on a long couch that had a back about 2 feet behind us while our dining companions were stuck on some tiny stools.  What kind of table is that for people that made their dinner reservations 6 weeks earlier?  By the time we had finished dinner and our desserts I was more than ready to have something to lean my back against.  Other than the weird seating that we were provided the top floor was pretty cool and gave all of us a hunting lodge type feel including a wood ceiling that made you feel like you were in a log cabin.  I decided to start off my evening with one of their cocktails since I had read many people raving about them on Yelp.  So I went with the Butcher Sour which consisted of Bulleit Rye, an egg white, lemon and bitters.  It was a pretty good drink which I enjoyed sipping throughout dinner. For dinner I decided on splitting the mac n cheese and Brussels sprouts with my fiancé while getting the dirty pasta for myself.  After we had ordered the waitress told us that items here come as they are ready from the ktichen and she certainly wasn't kidding.  First up was the mac n cheese which was pretty amazing.  As a matter of a fact I think it might be the best mac and cheese that I have had in Pittsburgh.  It was very decadent and rich with a number of different cheeses that had the perfect amount of gooiness to them.  In the middle of eating the mac and cheese our Brussels Sprouts came out.  They were also delicious with the sprouts being cooked very crispy with the brown butter, parmesan and lemon aioli giving them some nice depth although honestly they were good enough that I probably could have been just as happy without most of that.  As we were finishing that the Dirty Pasta's came out and so there were two of us eating our main dishes while the others had nothing in front of them.  The dirty pasta was easily my least favorite dish of the evening and consisted of ground duck, strozzapretti, sage, brandy and pecorino romano.  It started out well enough and I loved the ground duck but eventually the salt in the sauce became too much for me and by the end of the bowl I was not enjoying it at all.  I was also able to try my fiancés wagyu flank steak which was cooked nicely and which she loved.  After we had all finished our meals both of the ladies at our table ordered deep fried brownie for dessert.  After a fairly long wait and an apology from the waitress the brownies were delivered to the table.  Both of the ladies raved about how good they were with the outside of the brownie being a little hard while the inside was gooey.  The bottom line for me is that I can't really see myself coming back to the Butcher and the Rye too soon in the future.  While some of my dishes like the Brussels and mac and cheese were absolutely amazing I can't say that I was too happy with my main dish nor with our seating.   My fiance also encouraged me to give this 4 stars as she enjoyed her experience but mine was a little less enjoyable with my too salty main dish."}
{"text":"One of the cooler atmospheres in downtown.  Get a whiskey drink from their wall of booze and you will leave happy! Little tight by the bar at happy hour but it always seems crowded!"}
{"text":"Went here last night before a play at Heinz Hall, perfect location for that. Firstly, they messed up the reservation and booked it for the wrong night. They tried to seat us upstairs in a dark corner sitting on a little cube with a 2 ft diameter circular round table. I told the server this wouldn't work for me and the manager reseated us at a normal cocktail table. Notice I have given 4 stars, the problem was handled appropriately. We ordered martinis immediately, one of the worst martinis I have had in Pittsburgh, again, notice I gave 4 stars, I get it, this is a bourbon/whiskey bar. I had a couple makers 46 old fashioneds after that that were very good. Food is great, tartare was excellent, best I can recall having in Pittsburgh. Macaroni a cheese was one of the best things we ordered, give it a try. Almost didn't order the bread, that would have been a mistake, it was excellent. Overall this place is a cool atmosphere, not family oriented, which is a big plus for me. Downside is that some tables are so dark that you can't see what you're doing. I would not hesitate to go again, and I will try and hit it again in the next couple months, but this place isn't the end all be all of Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Everything about this place was first rate, the decor, the service, the unique cocktails and the food. Would definitely recommend this place to friends and will definitely go back again. Easily one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"We ate at this restaurant by chance but it was an excellent experience. The food was delicious and the serving staff attentive. We sat outside which was nice on a fall evening and perfect for dinner with a toddler. We had two of their featured cocktails - the pistachio one was to die for with a delectable creamy deliciousness. I could have had several without realizing it. For appetizers, we had the pig candy - crispy pork belly with apple Kim chi and caramel - this was nice and crunchy and was complimented by the sweet sauce; mac n cheese; and grilled octopus - this was a special appetizer and it came with a crispy polenta served with chickpeas and a puréed veggie. For our main dishes, we had the roasted chicken - delicious with wild mushrooms, creamed Brussels and grapes - nice combo of sweet and savory flavors. We also had the smoked lamb beck served with feta, spicy greens, beans and chimichurri. If you like lamb, this would be a good dish for you. The meat fell off the bone it was so tender. We had to finish the meal off with dessert - almond cake and pumpkin pie. Yum! Definitely a must eat on a visit to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Wow, great meal on all fronts at this casual and funky restaurant.  We were visiting Pittsburgh and read about this restaurant.  We tried for a reservation but couldn't get in and were headed somewhere else.  But we walked by that afternoon and inquired inside and were able to get seated in the bar area -- and glad we did.  The restaurant itself is charming and very \"Fixer Upper\", four floors that are all different and lots of nooks and crannies.  The whiskey selection is impressive (and tall).  Husband did a flight and I had a New York sour that was so good I may have ordered a second one (who can remember?).  We started with the Sunday gravy.  You should order this, but be forewarned it's hard to stop eating and you might fill up on it.  Our server told us that dish and the Pork and Lobster Sugo (which we also ordered and was also delicious) are one of the chef's grandmother's recipes.  You can't go wrong with that.  Other standouts: the housemade charcuterie plate and Filet mignon.  Service was wonderful. Attentive and friendly. We asked for guidance on the menu and he described the ingredients in detail with deep expertise. Looking forward to a return trip to this restaurant or maybe Meat and Potatoes. I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Worth it.  Ask for Ivan.  Great recommendations, great pairing suggestions, and great service.  We had Pig Candy, Scallops, and a Filet.  If nothing else... get the filet and a Manhattan."}
{"text":"Always a delight.  Food, drinks, and service are wonderful.  Atmosphere and decor are beyond!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to stop in here for a while now and finally got the chance to come in for a drink last night.   We went in on a very busy Saturday night but were able to find a seat after another couple left out about 10 minutes after we walked in.   The decor and ambience inside was quite wonderful.  The service from the waitress was great. She recommended drinks to us and came back to check on us a few times. This is a great place and you can see why the reviews are so high for it."}
{"text":"It was my birthday, and our daughter had given us a gift certificate, so we found booking reservations on Yelp (the restaurant is also on OpenTable, but never has availability there, so we had not made it before).  The place is two levels and our table was at a wall with lots of 2 tops on the second floor.  It was nice looking and intimate, but pretty close to the tables on either side, which has its pluses and minuses.  We had nice conversations with our neighbors, but not much privacy.  We ordered small plates, which were really good.  My duck liver pate was generous and very creamy, with a good cover (like a gelatin, but a little sweet) on top.  My next course, the bone marrow, was to die for.  A large bone, marrow still in, serve warm with parsley over it.  My wife's macs and cheese were creamy, with a nutty swiss cheese flavor and the portion was generous.   The downside is that the place is quite noisy, with low ceilings and little sound absorption."}
{"text":"Went here for drinks with friends. We were taken upstairs and given nothing but the best. I had one of the best old-fashioneds of my life! Will make this a priority whenever I'm back in the 'Burgh."}
{"text":"Phenomenal experience! As soon as you walk in, the whiskey bar is beautiful. We were seated upstairs, which was nice because we had a great view of the entire restaurant. The staff was friendly and knowledgable.   Now about the food... We started with the bone marrow and tartare. Both were delicious. The marrow was prepared exactly the way I love my bone marrow. Savory. I also really enjoyed the tartare. All of the flavors came together very nicely. I had the scallops with blue crab risotto, asparagus, mushrooms, and capers for my entree. Blew me away. Blue crab risotto = Genius. The scallops were cooked perfectly with a nice sear. I went with the lemon cream cake for dessert and really enjoyed the matcha sorbet that accompanied it.   I was only in Pittsburgh for the weekend and I am so happy that this was the restaurant I stumbled into. Rivals many of Chicago's (my home town) high end restaurants. Bravo."}
{"text":"Do I dare say that this may be my favorite restaurant of all time?! I know that's quite a claim - particularly for someone with 350 Yelp reviews - but I had a positively dreamy experience at Butcher and the Rye. I would give this place 6 stars here on Yelp if I could.  If you want to dine here at a normal time like a Thursday, Friday, or Saturday between 6-8pm, plan to make reservations far in advance. I made our February 13th reservations for 4 people over a month in advance! If you're currently looking to go on a Friday or Saturday night at 7pm, the next reservations currently available are Friday, April 4th or Saturday, April 19th. Umm.. whoa.  Why is this, you may ask? Well, yes, some of it is because this restaurant is new and popular and trendy. But it's also just THAT GOOD. I'm tempted to go ahead and make reservations for April or May. Let's be real... I'm already ready to go back.  So let's get down to the actual review... I absolutely love the decor. There is a strong and unique and intense theme in this restaurant -- an enormous wall of bourbon/whiskeys, grand chandeliers, luxurious wallpaper, and mounted animal heads. This place leaves a strong impression.  I had heard some negative opinions of the waiters/waitresses at both Butcher and the Rye and its sister restaurant Meat and Potatoes. However, our waiter was fantastic. He was available when needed but not overbearing. He had a great personality and even cracked a funny joke. (I think his name was Scott?)  And now to the food... our group of 4 shared bread, 6 small plates, 3 desserts, and each had a couple drinks. (Just a small note - don't get too committed to the online menu because the actual menu was a little bit different than what is on the website.) We started with the Focaccia Bread, Crispy Pig Wing, Pig Candy, Mac N Cheese, Shishito, Brussels, and Cauliflower. Our waiter did a great job of staggering the plates - bringing out two or three at a time - so our small table wasn't overwhelmed. All of the items were positively delicious, but if I had to choose my three favorites, I'd have to go with the Pig Candy, Mac N Cheese, and Brussels. These three items are the sort of dishes that you'd want to have on your last-meal-on-earth menu.  I broke up these small dishes with two alcoholic drinks - a rum based mixed drink and some sort of special punch. Just know that they were both very tasty, and I greatly appreciated the fact that Butcher and the Rye does not scrimp on the alcohol.  Finally, let's discuss the desserts. I think we all felt a bit silly ordering three, but we couldn't resist trying them. We had the deep fried brownie, pot de creme, and the sticky buns. All three were unique and heavenly! However, if forced to choose, I'd probably have to go with the deep fried brownie... because, well, it's a deep fried brownie.   If you can't tell from this book-long review, I loved this place and can't wait to return! I may need to make my April or May reservations ASAP. :)"}
{"text":"We love this place! For 2 people, we shared 2 small plates, 1 large plate, bread, and dessert, and it was plenty of food! The food is fantastic and the ambience is very unique.  Love it!"}
{"text":"After having gone to Meat & Potatoes a couple of times, I decided to give Butcher & the Rye a go and really glad that I did. In fact, I think I prefer it to M&P, even though they share owners.  They have a couple of tables set up outside on the sidewalk, and I got to sit out there during one of the nicer days in late May. The service right off the bat was great: the host was really friendly, as was the waitress, and incredibly helpful in deciding what to order. In the end I decided on the brown butter brussels (sprouts) and the soft shell crab that was on special that day. Both items were INCREDIBLE! I thought that the brussels I had at Emporio were good, but those at B&tR were far less salty, so they take the lead. And the soft shell crab was amazing, with just the hint of a kick. Bonus points to B&tR for having delicious non-alcoholic drinks that weren't your usual sodas/juices."}
{"text":"Great place for food, cocktails and atmosphere! I took my husband for his birthday and he hasn't stopped talking about it since! We had a great time but it can get expensive. This is now our favorite special occasion restaurant.   Arriving early for our reservation, we checked in and had a seat at the 1st floor bar. The bartender was welcoming despite it being a busy night. Their cocktail menu is impressive and it's a treat to watch the expert bartenders create them. I ordered the Wild Kind... made with Old Forester burbon, honey, ginger, lemon. This spot at the bar is an experience itself! The 2 story shelf of liquor behind the bar is a sight to behold.   We were seated upstairs for dinner in a tight row of tables with a bench against the wall and chairs on the other side. We were separate but very close to our neighbors. Our waitress was lovely...helpful and friendly.  If you eat nothing else ORDER THE MAC AND CHEESE!  We're so glad we did! So flavorful! I could have stopped the evening there and been satisfied. For dinner I ordered the scallops. It comes with blue cheese risotto, asparagus and mushrooms. Delicious. Perfectly cooked."}
{"text":"Called and made a reservation on a Thursday as this was where a friend wanted to go for his birthday.  The day of the reservation (the next day), I get a call at 5 pm (reservation was for 9:15) and the woman said: \"I'm sorry, but we're trying to close at 8:30 tonight, and the person who took your reservation didn't know that.  We can give you the same time at Meat and Potatoes, if you like.\"  This tells me: a)  You don't run the front of your house well.  b)  \"Trying to close at 8:30?\"  WTF? c)  You should have offered me some compensation, because by 5 pm on a Friday, I can't get a reservation anywhere until Tuesday. d)  Offering me \"Meat and Potatoes\" instead?  If I wanted to go there, I would have made a reservation there in the first place.  Amateurs.  If this is how you handle your customers, I'd be very scared of how you cook."}
{"text":"I have been on a roll lately with good food choices and Butcher was right up there. We initially made the reservation with the intentions of eating off of the restaurant menu but having never gone, there was too much on the regular menu to try!  We started with fresh focaccia that came with three spreads: ricotta, white bean, and an olive tapenade. All three were delicious and the bread was incredibly fresh.   Next up was Butcher's steak tartare. Ugh. Insanely good. This appetizer has everything I could want in a tartare! Capers, radishes, crusty bread, a truffled egg and a really good garlic aioli! There are three dishes in this world that get me truly excited, eggs benedict, Cuban sandwiches and steak tartare. This was they best I have ever had as far as tartare goes.    For my entree, I chose the dirty pasta. The pasta was made/cooked perfectly and the portion was also perfect.The sauce was ground duck, carrot and pecorino romano. In its entirety, the dish was addictive. I could not have asked for a better meal."}
{"text":"Love the food. Love the drinks. Love the Atmosphere.  The ceaser salad is great! The dirty pasta is great! The short ribs are Great!  Havn't had anything I havn't liked at Butcher and the Rye."}
{"text":"We started with the cheese plate and a whiskey flight titled \"around the world in 12 yrs\". It consisted of 3 different 1 oz pours. The cheese plate featured 4 very different cheeses, all delicious. For my main, I went with the scallops and my husband had the flank steak. We both enjoyed our meals, but agreed the scallops were better than the steak. I would definitely recommend this restaurant. The Salinger Sling cocktail was amazing. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"What an awesome, awesome, awesome restaurant I was really lucky I swung by around 7 PM and there was a spot available on the bar. After reading so many Yelp reviews praising the Brussels Sprouts and the Dirty Pasta, that's the two dishes I ordered and am so happy I did so, cause they were delicious!  Also, I wanted to lay off the alcohol so told the awesome bartender my taste prefs (rhubarb, ginger, lemon lime & berry) and she made me a delicious mock tail that totally wasn't on the menu #felt special!  The food here really lives up to expectations. My Brussels Sprouts were crispy and crunchy and the seasoning and accompanying sauce were super addictive. This dish also really balanced out the more earthy flavor of the ground duck in the Dirty Pasta. And speaking of that pasta, yummo!! It was so perfectly fresh and al dente.  The food left a smile on my tummy and serving sizes were very generous so I had leftovers and also no space for dessert (which looked party darn good - will just have to try when I come back).  One more note - the atmosphere here is really awesome! It was great sitting at the bar, as to my left was a local bloke who works as a sommelier in Pittsburgh, and we got chatting about food and wine and bartered restaurant names in Dublin.  If you are a Pittsburgh local who hasn't already been here, run don't walk, and make a reservation to dine here and enjoy the amazing eats!  Note: #342 of Yelp 100 challenge for 2016"}
{"text":"I went last night with my fiancee for my birthday and it being our 5 year anniversary since meeting.  The dinner did not disappoint.  I highly suggest the Acacia red wine.  Very affordable and drinkable.  It is exactly what I want in a dinner wine.  Although I ordered seafood, I still like my red wine.  For the evening, we had the focaccia bread appetizer, I ordered the scallops for entree, my fiancee ordered the hamburger special for the day, and dessert was pumpkin cheesecake.  Everything was awesome. The scallops were cooked perfectly, and the risotto was the best.  It definitely left me wanting more.  Dessert was perfect  not your typical pumpkin cheesecake, and the fruit garnish/syrup was a nice touch and contrast to the sweetness of the dessert.  I only wish that they had espresso for after dinner!  I wanted a pick me up before the show, but stayed with my last glass of water to finish off the meal.  Melissa was our waitress, and she did a great, great job of making recommendations.  She did convince me to switch to white wine for the entree, and I am glad that I did.  Thanks, Melissa!"}
{"text":"Just had drinks but the decor was excellent , this restuarant group does a great job with all thier properties and I think they understand their clienteles interests"}
{"text":"Absolutely the most delicious and unique Brussel sprout dish I had ever had. If you love tangy, salty, crunchy, and umami flavors all in one dish, you have to try their Brussel sprouts.  I give them a 5 star just for that,  even though the skirt steak dish was just ok."}
{"text":"5 stars for atmosphere innovation and excellence in food . From one foodie to another: push this one to the top of your list."}
{"text":"We had the wild boar and dirty pasta. Both were absolutely delicious!  Everything was exceptional. The mixed drink selection is amazing."}
{"text":"I travel to Pittsburgh a lot for work & every time I go and don't get to visit this place, I have regrets. Probably one of the best restaurant for this particular niche of American cuisine that I've been to. Would personally recommend the smoked lamb neck & the pulled burrata as a side. Great place in DT Pitt. to eat & socialize & makes a long work day away from home actually fun"}
{"text":"Finally had my first taste of Butcher and the Rye. It was outstanding. A friend and I came for restaurant week and had the special, Duck Confit. It was perfectly cooked and so delicious. Our waiter was wonderful, and the atmosphere is by far the best in Pittsburgh. I will be back many times."}
{"text":"Still incredible. Top notch service, unbelievable food. I could just motorboat the duck liver right there at the table. This has been one of my faves since it opened. I've never had a single complaint. It's my dream restaurant, except totally real."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a wonderful experience. Excellent food, great service, inviting atmosphere.  I started off with a whiskey tasting, around the world and the tartare.   Highly recommend both.  For dinner I loved the scallops, which may have been the best I ever tasted. The sear was incredibly tasty and the crab risotto was amazing. It was garnished with two different garnished that were refreshingly light. My wife enjoyed both her Brussel sprouts and Hanger Steak.  For desert we shared the strawberry pie. I would go back just for this alone. Kudos on the coffee. Nothing worse than having a great meal then finishing it off with a bad Cup of Joe. 5 stars all the way!  Make reservations at least two weeks in advance if you want a table past 7:00. With the Flight of whiskey, and 3 additional drinks the total came to $160.  Fairly priced for the quality."}
{"text":"Yeah, maybe this place is trendy. Yeah, maybe you're sick of the 4,000 photos of the whiskey wall on your social feeds. Yeah, maybe Butcher seems overhyped...but honestly, the place IS awesome.  If there's one complaint, it would be the hostess station, where - as both casual observers and customers - we've seen some arrogance and rudeness toward patrons who perhaps walked in, unaware of how busy Butcher gets, and were curious about getting a table. Pretentious attitude from a hostess? Yeah, they might want to curb that sooner, rather than later, being the host stand is your first impression.  Anyway, I digress...save yourself that hassle and make reservations. Butcher is almost always busy, and it's not always easy to post up in the bar area.  As for the whiskey, Butcher has one heck of a variety on-hand. You'll pay the price if you want to go deep, but there are plenty of excellent, cost-friendly choices on the menu, as well. It's an overwhelming amount of choices, so I'd recommend downloading the Grail app, so you can peruse their whiskey list ahead of time!  There are two things that make Butcher worth going, though, that I think is better than the whiskey (let's face it, unless you're looking to drop $25+ on a 1oz pour of some hard-to-find spirits, you can get a solid whiskey at most places nowadays): the food, and the service.  We've NEVER had bad service at Butcher. We've had a party of two...up to a party of 50+, and the service has always been top-notch. The staff is friendly, knowledgeable, and a pleasure to chat with. They'll be able to steer you in the direction of a whiskey that's in your budget, and they'll be able to provide in-depth info of the food menu. Oh...and you'll never have an empty glass of water (a huge plus to me).  The food is excellent, albeit indulgent. For example, the brussels sprouts are phenomenal, but I can't tell if the brussels themselves are good, or it's just the delicious filth that tops them. Frankly, I don't care, though. Delicious is delicious is delicious. The mac & cheese, shishito peppers, bread, baked camembert, bone marrow...you name it, we've tried it. All of it has been enjoyable...but indulgent, like I said. Don't stop in looking to eat a \"healthy\" meal. Stop in with pure American gluttony in mind. To clarify, though, the portions aren't gluttonous, but the flavor is.  My favorite menu item, though, is the Butcher Burger. Ground in-house, and limited to 20 per day. Get there early and get one. It's one of the best burgers in the city, hands down. It's not loaded with a bunch of nonsense, either. The burger meat gets most of the spotlight, and it deserves a spotlight (it may actually need one to be seen in Butcher's very dark atmosphere).  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"If I could give it 6 stars I would.  Was one of the better meals I have had in a while.  Made reservations early in January for Valentine's day, and could still only get 10PM!    Started off at the bar with a Blood and Sand cocktail, which was great.  I will say that I do like bourbon, but none of the bourbon cocktails jumped out at me.  I ended up with a scotch based drink while in a bourbon bar, oh well, moving on.     Started off with the bone marrow, while it was delicious, the star of this dish I believe is the Oxtail Jam.  I almost didn't even want the bone marrow, just the bread with that jam.  It was amazing, seriously.  For my main course I had the Waygu Flank Steak and it was delicious as well.  Was cooked perfectly, the potatoes and aioli really completed the dish.  Had to get dessert, right?  Went with the fried brownie.  While I would've liked more ice cream to have a better brownie/ice cream ratio, is a small complaint.    Bottom line, make the reservations for whenever you can and go.  One of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"This was the first destination on my list of \"Undisclosed Date Location\" with the Legend. Our reso was for 730, and we were seated a bit early, which was kind of nice. We started with 2 specialty cocktails, Salinger's Sling, and the Boulevardier. Both were mixed expertly and we each had 2 more. We ordered the Charcuterie Board and Mac N Cheese as our apps, and promptly destroyed both. The Legend doesn't get loud about much, but he was singing the praises of that Mac n cheese to the high heavens! Next came our entrees of Scallops for me, and Hanger Steak du Poivre for My Love. Both were absolutely phenomenal, and I can safely say, I've never had scallops prepared more perfectly. The hanger steak was seasoned well, and potatoes had a lovely crisp on them. My blue crab risotto was to die for, creamy, and not the least bit gummy. No dessert for the Legend or I this evening, but one more cocktail? Don't mind if we do!"}
{"text":"The meat palace is not one to pass on, if you're contemplating a visit... Take my advice and have a bourbon and tasty plate of_______ (you fill in the blank) you won't regret it everything is delicious."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh! The pig candy and the Brussels are sooooo good!  If I save enough room for an entree (which is difficult sometimes since the appetizers are all delicious), the scallops are my favorite!"}
{"text":"I was hesitant to stray from Meat & Potatoes due to the mediocre reviews I read at Butcher and the Rye's opening. So glad they didn't deter me. The Pig Candy is a must for an appetizer. The scallops were perfect. Of course the cocktails were all incredible. The only 'cons'-- A little pricey, and the women's bathroom was... strange."}
{"text":"Hits the spot every time. Can't go wrong with anything on the menu, but crowd faves Marrow, Pig Candy, and Dirty Pasta are truly worth all the hype.   And Holy Whiskey!! If you're like me, you'll never get bored trying and tasting the 600+ varieties.   Service is excellent. And if the weather's nice, do yourselves a favor and sit outside-- great spot for people watching and a nice breeze comes off the river."}
{"text":"I would give this 4.5 stars if I could. Lots lots to love here. The food is the highlight. The cocktails are good. We had fried Brussels and pig candy small plates. Awesome!  We enjoyed the scallops and halibut immensely. The service was excellent. The atmosphere is dark and moody which we liked but the place got so loud we could hardly carry a conversation. My husbands chair was very uncomfortable and he rarely complains about anything so I know he was uncomfortable. We would go back if we visit Pittsburgh again, I think."}
{"text":"After the Ben Folds/Pittsburgh symphony concert in mid June myself, my boyfriend, and his friend headed over to Butcher and the Rye-directly across the street from Heinz Hall. I had made 10:15 reservations for 4 (according to open table that was the earliest they could seat a 4 top) and it worked out well because the show was over at 10. Although we became a party of 3, they easily accommodated us and we were seated directly beneath the antler chandelier. We all loved the rustic decor and the bourbon/whiskey wall behind the bar was very cool. We did not get a chance to go upstairs but I could see it somewhat and it looked mostly the same as the downstairs. We were greeted quickly, our drinks took longer than we'd have liked but the quality of the 2 cocktails quickly made up for that . We ordered a dogfishhead 60 minute, a manhattan, and a butcher sour (my drink of choice). The cocktail I enjoyed was nicely handcrafted and the manhattan was described as \"aces\"-so this is an excellent place to grab a unique cocktail. The features they had last night looked delicious (a burger with pork belly, a hangar steak with frites, a squash tasting, and a pasta) however we were told that they were out of all of the features. The three of us started with the pig candy-\"pork belly / apple kim chi / miso caramel / cilantro\"-it was very tasty but not enough for three people so I only had a small bite and let the other 2 in my party eat most of it. As for entrees, the pappardelle (braised rabbit / carrots / tomato / celery / parmesan), the shepherd's pie (braised beef cheeks / creamed peas / carrots / bacon / potato foam), and the mac and cheese off of the small plate menu (taleggio / fontina / goat cheese / cheddar / parmesan). I did not try the pappardelle but that is what I would have ordered had I not ordered the mac and cheese. I was told it was well cooked with large noodles. I tried a bite of the shepherd's pie-the beef cheeks were excellent and the potato foam was like nothing I had tasted before. it was more of a deconstructed shepherd's pie with the potato foam covering the dish. The mac and cheese was off the charts yummy! It was very creamy and rich and was the perfect size to finish on my own. The top was toasted nicely and the crunchiness naturally meshed nicely with the creaminess of the cheese. It is rather hard to get reservations here but it was well worth it and I'd love to go back and try the Butcher's Bride cocktail and the pappardelle. Hopefully a return trip won't be too far in the future!"}
{"text":"excellent service with lots of information about each dish and each drink. started with the dry aged tartare, which was my favorite dish based on taste and presentation. after this was the marrow, which was tastey and i especially liked the oxtail jam. after this came the brussels which were salty but very very good. then came the crispy octopus with chickpea purée which was good. then i got the filet which was very good and the bone marrow custard that goes with it is amazing. then i got scallops over blue crab risotto which was probably the best tasting dish of the night. then came doughnuts which were good. then the chocolate cheesecake, the passion fruit sorbet topping was my favorite part of any dish of the night.   only complaint i have is the lighting was pretty dim i would have liked to been able to see my food better. also they charge $8 per bottle of Voss water but we were also given 2 other options of waters.   Overall great experience and will be returning to try the mussels, mac n cheese, and dirty pasta."}
{"text":"Cool interior.  I would agree with another reviewer, rustic yet modern, not stuffy.  Very busy when I went, 8pm dinner on a Friday night.  Good thing we had reservations or we would not have even been let into the bar area, guess it was already at capacity.  We were seated upstairs in the table area.  There's a second bar upstairs that's pretty cool too in addition to the one downstairs.  My husband complained that it was quite dark where we were seated and he couldn't read the menu.  Service was good but felt rushed.  The idea is to order a bunch of small plates to share and I asked the server if we should order them all at the same time or only one or two at a time.  She said to order all at one time and they just come out as they're ready.  Well all 6 or 7 seemed to come out within a 2 minute time span and my husband and I barely had room on our tiny table to hold all of the food.  This made it feel a little cramped and rushed.  However, the food itself tasted great.  I enjoyed everything we ordered.  Standouts include the pig candy (pork belly), the hanger steak and the salad with caesar dressing.  Drinks were fantastic.  Excellent bourbon selection.    My main issue with the place is the bathrooms!  ZERO privacy.  I mean, you walk in and you can see down into the two stalls easily and whatever the person is doing in the stall.  The stall door and walls only come up barely to your hipbone while standing.  Cross your fingers that you don't have and adverse GI issues after dinner or you're in trouble.  I'm not a prudish person but it was awkward, even just for a number 1!  I would go again, the food was worth another trip.  I will definitely order less plates at a time next time I go and that should solve the \"rushed\" issue."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in the city. It's definitely worth the wait to get a reservation. The atmosphere is incredible with so many unique rustic chic pieces. I'm not a fan of whisky, but the huge wall of whisky behind the bottom floor bar is always a draw for the eye.   Some favorite dishes would include the scallops, the Brussel sprouts and the beer battered brownie.   Just. Go."}
{"text":"Came here to try it for restaurant week. Have been wanting to go, so thought best opportunity would be this deal. I was wrong. The 2015 restaurant week menu was terrible. For $35 you had NO choices...none. What was on the menu is what you got. That was really disappointing right off the bat. Had I known that I would have 100% gone elsewhere to eat.    After starting off really bad and burning my finger on the one 1800s candle they have at the table, I decided to order. Luckily I could even see the menu it was so dark in there!  Ordered beet salad, mac and cheese, and steak.   Wow. The food was great. This place really redeemed itself after the disappointing first impression.   Beet salad was amazing. Loved that it actually had lettuce with it. Steak was great. Mac and cheese is a must order!   Our total bill plus 2 beers and dessert was $80. We shared a full meal, so that was just a one person meal.  Pretty pricy, and was a one time experience.   Loved the food, atmosphere to dark, but wouldn't go back again."}
{"text":"We tried to go to Meat and Potatoes. They were full. This was a VERY good alternative!! We didn't have reservations but were able to get seats upstairs at the bar. Great service and great food! Our favorite was the marrow! Oxford jam was different but didn't disappoint."}
{"text":"Service & meal always solid. The bar can get a loud, whiskey drunk guys trying to pick up girls is a little much when you are having dinner on the other side of the fence."}
{"text":"The drinks, charcuterie plate, and mac and cheese there were amazing.  However, my girlfriend ordered the pan-seared bass and the plate came enguled in this potent (and honestly terrible-tasting) sauce, which we deduced was probably the shellfish emulsion.  I'd recommend going because I ordered the scallops, and that was an amazing plate!  Just beware to anyone thinking of ordering the pan-seared bass, you are in for an odd taste."}
{"text":"I had dinner on a Tuesday night and was seated at the bar upstairs. I ordered soup (charred broccoli) which was little salty otherwise good. For main course I had the trout which was alright."}
{"text":"Delicious! The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because I haven't tried enough and if I'm back in Pittsburgh, I'd be excited to.  I visited during a work trip and as a lone diner, enjoyed my meal very much! I ordered the bone marrow (yes for 1!) and the pig candy, which both I was excited about just by reading about it or viewing it on the menu.  The bone marrow was perfectly cooked and just what I imagined and craved - the toast that it came with was delicious and not too crunchy (sometimes it is). The pig candy was flavorful with the miso sauce, fatty but not overwhelming, and the meat was tender.  Drinks - standard, which I could appreciate. The staff, though only a short engagement, was friendly enough.  Overall, great quick dining experience but food is really top notch."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. We enjoyed everything we ordered. I gave it 2 starts because this was our first time eating at the restaurant. The first time we attempted to go we were just trying to stop for a drink at the bar but the host told me they were too busy to even let us stand over there with our drinks so we left-- we never even made it past the hostess stand. After hearing rave reviews about the food we decided to try again but make a reservation and sit at a table. When we walked in, a male employee rolled his eyes at us and acted as though he was much too busy to even greet us. The hostess asked him if he would like to seat us and he didn't even look up and said she should do it in what I thought to be a rude tone. I made a joke to the girl seating us for them to not all jump at once to show us to our table. She apologized for him twice. I was on a date with my fiancé so I let it roll off, but she shouldn't have to apologize for anyone else's actions. To my surprise, that same rude gentleman named Evan ended up being our server. Why would you greet (or lack of greeting at all) guests so rudely at the front door if they could potentially be a table you wait on? Both myself and my fiancé do and have worked in service in the past. I even managed a restaurant a few years back and I can't even imagine one of my employees being so rude. The whole time he waited on us I felt like his personality was extremely fake because he wanted to save face and hopefully get a nice tip. We did still tip him over 20% because the food was great and to be honest if he doesn't change his attitude he will most likely be looking for work and may need the few extra bucks to get by."}
{"text":"Was here for work and decided to check out the bar. My friendly, handle-stash-rocking, bar tender made me a delicious old fashioned. Got the seasonal salad which was ok and the pappardelle pasta which was fantastic. The space included antlers on walls and modern chandeliers. Would be a good date spot or small group meet up. Recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Can't believe I forgot about this review for all this time. As I tell a lot of my friends this is hands down one of the top 3 meals I have had in the city of Pittsburgh thus far. I can't think of a single complaint. It was a beautiful day so we got to sit outside at a little table and enjoy the city. The waiter was super patient and helpful. He helped us pick out a drink and made suggestions as well. Both of us absolutely loved our Old Fashioned. The restaurant itself is a little dark but I think that gives it a nice ambience.  But my absolute favorite part was the scallops. OMG AMAZING. Scallops is something that can be so easily screwed up. It's fairly simple to make them but if you screw up that flavor you basically just served someone little balls of rubber and no one wants that. These scallops were phenomenal though. The flavor was perfect paired with the risotto. I almost wished I had ordered another one to take home with me.  If you have not been to Butcher and the Rye yet I strongly suggest you make it a point to get there relatively soon. I promise you won't be disappointed. Just writing this review makes me want to text one of my friends and ask them to go back with me. Absolutely spot on, good job!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for dinner on a Friday night, and was glad I had made a reservation. It was very busy, and we were advised to wait at the bar until our table was ready. The wait was only about 10 minutes. I ordered a Boulevardier, which was promptly prepared by a very enthusiastic bartender who corrected my French.   The ambiance was loud and dark, and I did not care for the music (mostly rap). The decor had a victorian-gothic theme, which didn't fit with the music at all. Overall the atmosphere was too \"bro\" for my liking.  We were soon shown our table which was on the second floor by a balcony that allowed us to look down at the bar, which was pretty neat. But the seats were very low compared to the table, making us feel very short, and it was hard to have a conversation over the music and noise. Our server was very polite and helpful, and the services was pretty quick considering how busy it was. To start, we ordered a charcuterie plate and some fresh sourdough bread with lardo (whipped pork fat) and gravy. The best thing was the bread and lardo, which was like butter but better and had salt, herbs, and spices in it. The charcuterie plate was mostly good, though greasy, but perhaps not worth the $20 it went for. As for main dishes, I ordered the rabbit coq-au-vin, and my husband got the hangar steak. Both of these were tasty for the first few bites, until we realized how salty they were. I could not finish my dish even though I was hungry, because of the amount of salt used. Best part of the main dishes: the broccoli that came with my husband's steak. I was surprised to find what looked like rabbit hearts in my coq-au-vin, which I could have done without.   Overall, I was disappointed by the food, happy with the service, and put off by the ambiance. I really wanted to enjoy this place, but unfortunately it fell short of my expectations."}
{"text":"The food was outstanding, and our server, Sarah, was fantastic.  She gave us honest feedback and suggestions about our food choices, and she checked back often to see how we enjoyed each course.  I would recommend this restaurant in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Two thumbs up. Food was spectacular and very innovative. Got the bone marrow app and it was to die for. They even let our pup sit outside with us while we dined. A must go to while here."}
{"text":"Great selection of whiskey and scotch for a mostly fair price structure. However for the price, they really could improve the 20 min wait time for a server to stop by and buy more than just one iPad to view the menu.  Great concept but I would like to peruse the selections while I drink, not continually have to ask the server to bring it back.   Think about an app or something. Word of Beer does the iPad/app thing and it's great.   Like the atmosphere and location, especially being collocated to their delicious Tako restaurant.   Would also like to see more seating options, especially for disabled people, as the space is narrow and tight, which makes it a little tricky for a wheelchair if you can't score a table. I will say however the staff did you a great job making the best effort to accommodate. Some friendly patrons moved as well to make space.  Very cool, Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh deserves this restaurant. Food and atmosphere some of the best in the city. Rivals some of the coolest places in LA. The only the negative I can say is service is so so, but Pittsburgh in general has pretty average service. Make sure you make a reservation, and get the beef tar tar. (and get over the bathroom, its not that big of a deal)"}
{"text":"The food here is really good. As a group, we went for scallops (outstanding!), pig wing (succulent, tender), brussel sprouts (i want to eat them again today), and roast chicken (tender, juicy, rich and flavorful). We really enjoyed the food. The portions are small, but I've decided that's a good thing, even though you pay the same as you'd pay for larger portions elsewhere. Basically, there's no chance you're going to be uncomfortable and regret eating too much of X. Service was also pretty good. No complaints. Because the weather was really nice, we wanted to eat outside. The outside part of Butcher and the Rye is not so nice. This isn't their fault, but I wouldn't eat outside again. Sixth avenue is a busy corridor for two things that will bug the hell out of you while eating dinner: 1) Port Authority busses belching fumes and making noise; and 2) Downtown drunks belching fumes and making noise. And I don't mean the kinds of drunks that trip over their high heels and screech at their friends... these would have been ok; I mean the kinds of drunks that drool and fart and beg for change while tripping over their shoe laces. So, go for the food, and eat indoors, and you'll enjoy it."}
{"text":"Chris at the bar elevated my Valentine's blues as I was dining alone with my boo in Boston. Cocktails on point. Refined and attention to detail. Pork Belly app and roast chicken Main were delish. If you are in PGH, you must GO!"}
{"text":"Clean and creative. A little warm on the top level but worth the experience. Many quality whiskeys to choose from. Knowledgeable staff and upbeat vibe."}
{"text":"SETTING: Dimly lit, with a complete bar inside the restaurant. Pretty unique layout. Waiters bring the food up from a kitchen located downstairs? The bathrooms were also unconventional. Go check it out!  FOOD: For appetizers, I shared the pig candy and Brussels sprouts with my friends. My main entree, I got the Dirty pasta (with ground duck).  I couldn't help but think of one word when dining here: \"salty\". I'm not sure if Butcher and the Rye tends to be a bit more heavy handed with the salt, or if it was this one occurrence. But the Brussels sprouts and Dirty Pasta definitely were more than a bit salty to me.   Brussels sprouts were large enough in quantity to share with a large group. My one friend described it best, \"Kind of tastes like the Cool Ranch Doritos\". The taste was so empowering that I honestly could not taste the Brussels sprouts at all, which is unfortunate.  Pig Candy was pretty decent. A small plate for one, it was tasty, but nothing to write home about. I sometimes judge how much I like a plate by evaluating my willingness to part with it and order something else the next time I come back. Let's just say, I'd probably give another appetizer a chance.    Dirty Pasta was unique; first time I ever had \"ground\" duck. The noodles were thick and chewy with bits of ground duck sprinkled into the pasta. The sauce was good, but again, a bit salty, so I did not enjoy it as much as I could have. Out of what we ordered, my friends liked this dish most.   SERVICE: Need to reserve in advance! This place gets booked fast especially for dinners on Friday and Saturdays. Very polite wait staff and professional.  IMPRESSIONS: I wish I could say I would highly recommend this place, after hearing the hype surrounding this restaurant. Unfortunately I don't think I can at this time. I don't think my friends were that blown away either. Too much salt :( and nothing that stood out to us."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh Restaurant Week always encourages me to go out and try a new place that I've been meaning to get to, but just haven't made time for yet.  When my friends and I saw Butcher & the Rye on the list, we made time :)  Walking in you see the rustic yet classy decor - boar's head hanging on the wall mixed with upscale lighting.  I felt like I walked into a HGTV makeover or something - yes, this is a compliment!  I wish I had that kind of style.  We came for the RW menu, but since it was one of the last days of Restaurant Week, they decided to change things up.  We weren't too keen on the new menu they selected (since we already had our meals picked) so we went with plan B - order a bunch of items and share!!  First I need to talk about my drink - Blood & Sand = THANK YOU!!!!!!!  THANK YOU FOR KNOWING HOW TO MAKE THIS DELICIOUS BEVERAGE!!!  (Yes I realize I used all caps.  I would shout this from the rooftops if I could)  Food Time:   My friends and I ordered a bunch of small plates:  PEI MUSSELS $12 red curry / coconut milk / long beans / tomato / lime / cilantro MAC N CHEESE $10 taleggio / fontina / goat cheese / cheddar / Parmesan A homemade bread (sorry can't find it on the website to access ingredients) BEET SALAD 10 goat cheese / croutons / pickled fennel / gem lettuce / pepitas / blood orange dressing.  The mussels were delicious - though I later learned that I (sadly) have an allergy to them.  The Mac N Cheese was, in a word, HEAVENLY!  Creamy and incredibly decadent.  I've tried many Mac N Cheese dishes, but this is the best, thus far.  The bread was warm and fresh with 3 delicious dips - olive, Alfredo, and one other I cannot recall.  Finally my yummy beet salad!  Who would think to turn the goat cheese into little fried cheese balls?  Creative and tasty, but light with a delicious vinaigrette.  For my main dish, I selected the Sea Bass with wasabi mashed - Light and flavorful!  I was pleased with my selection.  I did not want to share my dish with ANYONE.  I kept it to myself.  Before running off to the theater, we decided to end the night with a sweet treat.  My friend and I shared: SUNDAE 8 coconut cream cheese ice cream / carrot cake / compressed pineapple / candied carrot.  Candied carrots?  Why can't all carrots be candied?!?  If they were kids would never have a problem eating their vegetables.  I could have licked this bowl, if I wasn't in public.  The creamy ice cream, the coconut, sweet carrot, moist cake... I'm drooling... I'll stop.  Don't wait until the next restaurant week to visit Butcher and the Rye.  Make the time and visit them this weekend, tonight even.  Your stomach will thank you... unless you're allergic to mussels.  If you are, skip them and order more candied carrots!"}
{"text":"This place didn't cut it.  Went in for drink and despite a pretty decent bar couldn't get a proper cocktail.  The place looks nice but that's about it."}
{"text":"Dined there with some work colleagues as a colleagues going away party.  I opted for Pan Seared Halibut and Mac and Cheese.  The Mac and cheese was fantastic, and I could probably have eaten two bowls full!  The halibut left me wanting more. There were too many veggies on my plate in my personal opinion, and there was something in the sauce with them that when it encountered my Halibut made it taste sour and not well cooked.  The restroom is a little hard to get used to. Small with weird doors. You'll get what I mean when you go.  Otherwise the service was friendly and the waiter was great. Attentive but not to intrusive!"}
{"text":"Most incredible cocktails and appetizers ever. Don't miss the rustic bread with butter and gravy and the Brussel sprouts."}
{"text":"I've had memorable food at Meat and Potatoes, so I was more than ready to try its sister venue. It didn't disappoint. Four stars for food, three for service; we'll round it up to a four. On this visit, I was traveling alone, so I bellied up to the bar. Service was a bit slow and scattered, which was really the only downside of my visit. I tried the dry aged beef tartare and the Brussels sprouts. The tartare was beautifully presented, but a bit underseasoned, and lacking the funk that typically comes from dry aging. The sprouts were crispy and seasoned to my liking with dill, parmesan, and lemon aioli, but I can see where they wouldn't be to everyone's taste. I'll be back to sample more of the menu."}
{"text":"The drinks at Butcher and the Rye are phenomenal. I haven't had the opportunity to try a lot of the food yet but the atmosphere is fun and a great spot for happy hour or post-dinner drinks."}
{"text":"Overall very good. We had 4 in our party and split multiple dishes. Two orders of focaccia (3 different spreads, all excellent), pig candy (very tasty by small to split), charcuterie board (very good, I think a tad over priced), and a special octopus \"pastrami\" (think...a deconstructed octopus reuben, very good). We then split 3 main dishes...the Dirty Pasta, Flank Steak, and Scallops.  All were very good, hard to decide if the pasta or steak were better.  I guess the only complaint would be the service. It seemed rushed, and our waitress was very condescending. Lose the hipster attitudes..."}
{"text":"This place is great for drinks,  dessert, service  and  for crowds but the food is mediocre. I love the setting, the service and the ambience. We  sat upstairs and  it was better to be able to have a conversation. The bar is loud. The drinks were amazing and I had the ' Rose all day' and my  husband had the ' bobby burns ' We loved those drinks. Then the food came and we ordered 4 plates to share from the specials. The octopus was chewy and the mushrooms were too salty. The bread, pork and spala was good but could be better. The  server was very polite and paid attention to the details. The dessert, the flourless chocolate cake was amazing and the coffee was ok. The four stars is because of the food and ventilation and  the smell of food  on my clothes  after I left the restaurant. I may go back but most likely I will only visit for drinks."}
{"text":"One of the best whiskey bars I have had the pleasure to eat and drink in! Our bartender Amanda is clearly a whiskey and rye connoisseur and helped us adventure into new whiskey we had not tried before. Perfectly poured our Manhattans, and was very attentive. She even gave me her own personal portable charger to charge my phone that was almost dead! The food was equally amazing - we had the brussels sprouts (totally delicious) and the duck neck ragu (what a surprise how meaty and flavorful this was!). This place gets busy, and I can see why. Check out the amazing wall of whiskey - quite unique and impressive. We sat at the bar as it was very busy, but so glad we did so we could chat about spirits with Amanda."}
{"text":"4 stars and I have only had drinks there! Huge whiskey guy, and their wall reminds me of Game of thrones so it's a plus! I will eat there soon as I live in the city. TK"}
{"text":"Great service every time, fabulous food , and perfectly mixed drinks .  The bone marrow is a must!"}
{"text":"I wish I could join the chorus. I really like Meat and Potatoes their other restaurant. Everything was a near miss. It's a cool menu, they have a great bar, the decor is great. Service was ok. Perhaps trying to do too much?  They're opening 2 other restaurants from what I gather. It's a familiar tale.   I tried 3 dishes. The first was a special. Squash soup garnished with duck confit and pickled cranberries as I recall. This was the best of the 3. A bit more duck please as there were just a few shards of overcooked bits. It came out just barely warm.  Maybe they spent too much time garnishing it?  Would have been nicer, hotter.    Next, \"Brussels\". A bowl of Brussel sprouts in brown butter with a lemon aioli and dill topped with grated cheese. Still a bit nauseous thinking about it. Where was the dill?  The aioli was smeared inside the bowl a bit.  There was barely enough to talk about. They didn't skimp on the butter though. Ugh. It was swimming.    Somewhere around this time my eyes started burning and I thought I would be treated for smoke inhalation from the burning bread in the kitchen.  I imagine the near loaf they serve as under their Cesar salad being torched helplessly under the salamander until no trace of the craftsmanship of the baker remained. Sure enough, my dining companions Cesar bread was burnt.   Lastly, I had the pig wings. Long beans, mango (too little) other veggies, cilantro, glazed and somewhat candied pork. Interesting dish but lacked balance. It was way too sweet just as my wife's peppers were way too salty. Everything missed."}
{"text":"Although the name suggests that food is the focus (\"Butcher\" does come first in the name), clearly it's the \"Rye\" - and other whiskey spirits - that are the star of the show here. Not that comestibles are forgotten, FAR from that! I'd stick a fork in anyone who tried to come between me and my Shishito Peppers and aioli, Crispy Pig Wing, Roasted Brussels Sprouts or Pig Candy! It's just that when an entire floor-to-SOARING-ceiling wall-o-whiskey is the first thing you see when you come through the door, well...the emphasis is evident.  While you're perusing the premises, it will be hard to find one spot for your eye to settle on because there's so much to see. I swear the restaurant is as much an art installation as it is a spot for fine dining. And drinking, of course. The surroundings have been curated and built by the chef himself. Rick DeShantz, of Meat & Potatoes fame, put together a restaurant for all the senses. And I'm not just talking about the food.  Every elevation, twist and turn holds new curiosities from a Jackalope riding squirrel to a grown-ass bear to tattooed red leather chairs to door knobs for purse hooks on the upstairs bar made of recycled vintage doors to the quirky Ladies' Room downstairs that allows you to make eye contact and conversation with your across-the-divider neighbor and still take care of private necessities. I can only imagine what special features the Mens' Room has! Explore every level, explore every nook and cranny. What Chef DeShantz didn't handle himself, he hired the best of the best to tackle. Like the amazing murals!  Bottom line...if you're a fan of art, antiquities and bizarrities, check this place out. You won't be disappointed.   On to the cocktails. Please! Downstairs the wonderful wall-o-whiskey dominates the room. Here's where you'll settle in for flights and tastings and drinks made of the finest whiskeys around. At all price levels. You name the whiskey, I'd be shocked if B&R doesn't have it. Give it a try.   Head up the stairs...and up yet another smaller set of stairs still...and you find yourself at my own favorite spot of all. Bar Manager Mike Mills put his head together with Rick's to come up with a bar setup all other bartenders must drool over. There's even an area behind the bar to cook up syrups and shrubs, bitters and brews and all sorts of cocktail creativity. Be sure you order a classic cocktail here. My fave? A cool, refreshingly tart and sweet Ramos Gin Fizz. Oh my! There is absolutely no doubt whatsoever why the The Butcher and the Rye is a semi-finalist for James Beard Outstanding Bar Program this year!  Classic/craft cocktails not your scene? Maybe one of the original cocktails from some of the best bartenders in the city. (When I talked about Rick being a curator, I was talking about the way he gathered not just the artwork, but some of the most talented cocktologists in the city under one roof. Well...he and business partner Tolga Sevdik conspired to make that happen!)   One other thing...Monday nights from 6:00 PM on, there's a little (BIG) deal going on upstairs called PopUp Embury. Yep, The old renowned Embury makes a weekly appearance with the former Embury's own Spencer Warren behind the stick. Guest bartenders from all over the 'Burgh and elsewhere recreate the magic that was Embury for those of us who miss it or MISSED it before the magic ended. Don't miss it while it's there....last call for PopUp Embury is scheduled for March 31st. See you there!"}
{"text":"Color me impressed! We had been underwhelmed by M&P (mostly with the service), so I had been hesitant to try Butcher and the Rye. However, we were going to Heinz Hall across the street for the Symphony, so we wandered in at 6pm on a Friday night with no reservation. The hostess offered to seat us outside or at the bar, and when I mentioned that the bar looked full, she let me know that there was an upstairs bar that had many seats available. This upstairs bar was great--Kimber, the bartender, was gregarious yet efficient, and the upstairs area was considerably quieter, perfect for our date night.  We ordered the pig candy (small plate), the rabbit rillette, and the dirty pasta (large plate). My husband was so enamored with the rillette that he was about to order another one, when the gentleman behind the bar cautioned us that our upcoming pasta dish was quite rich, and we might want to hold off. The pig candy was really tasty, and the kimchi cut through the richness nicely. However, the star of the show was definitely the dirty pasta. The strozzapretti was beautifully chewy, and the cream sauce was rich, but not overpowering. It was something akin to a white bolognese, with meaty chunks of duck, fine pieces of carrot, and just enough liquid to bring the cheese and everything else together.  We also enjoyed several drinks, the most standout of which was the Trade Winds, a five-spiced version of a Moscow Mule. Drinks here are not cheap, but they are innovative and made with care.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"I did not enjoy my experience here as much as i thought i would. The look of resturant was beautiful. I love the library inspired bar and it's old school vibe.  the service was good however, the seating was uncomfortable. We were seated upstairs and the tables were way to close for comfort. I could overhear the table next to me talking about their fantasies without even trying to eavesdrop. I was even afraid to cross my legs that I might kick her that's how close we were. I almost felt like I was on a double date with strangers. The food options are very rich flavored and aquired tastes and there wasn't really any staples to fall back on but that could be just due to my personal taste. My husband really liked his meal."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I love this restaurant.  The decor is fun and interesting which makes for a great experience.  The food is always amazing & the drinks reasonable.  The servers are always A+ giving you privacy for a romantic evening while keeping the flow of dinner going.  We love the farm to table menu.  It's our go to date night spot."}
{"text":"Whenever I want to splurge, I book a table here. I have a large, picky family and everyone can find something they like.   The food is excellent. I have never ordered a dish and then ordered it again once I finished eating it. But, the tartar is out of this world.   The one downside is that it is very loud--people and music and no sound dampening makes it a little intense."}
{"text":"\"Butcher and the Rye.\"  The name catches one's attention.  Before they opened, I was checking their Twitter and Facebook pages to get updates on when they would open.  They were posting pictures on twitter such as their impressive collection of whiskey.  I was excited.  Really excited.  This place had to be good. I was ready to go opening week.  I was ready to be impressed.  I was ready for a place that would serve awesome food (creative or simple) and great drinks, like the many places I've visited in other major cities.  Unfortunately, Butcher and the Rye became the dictionary definition of disappointment for me.  Food (7.5/10) = Tried the following dishes:  1) House bread with 3 different spreads (apple butter, honey butter, can't remember the third) = Nothing special.  It was just bread.  I thought the honey butter was the best of the three spreads.  The quantity of spreads greatly exceeds the amount of bread provided (Four dinner rolls).  If you are going to charge $4-6 (can't remember the exact price), surely you would expect more bread.  It was just bread.  One kind.  Not the basket/board with an assortment of different breads other restaurants have on their menu when they slap a similar price tag.    2) Cauliflower with farro, romanesco, carrot, brown butter, harissa = ($10) = $10 for a small bowl of meh cauliflower?!  My group ended up ordering this dish per recommendation of our waitress.  I don't have a problem paying high prices for incredible food.  However, I was not impressed.  My group was not impressed.  The flavors were forgettable.  The price on the other hand was not; this dish is way-overpriced.  3) Manicotti with apple bourbon butter, oxtail, pecorino, pickled apples = $10 = The flavors of this dish were good but not great.  You get 4 pieces, each the size of approx. 2.5 x 1.0 inches.  Like the cauliflower, the dish is not worth $10 to me.  4) Baked Camembert with phyllo, apple, olive oil, rosemary, grilled bread = $15 = another just ok dish.  We ended up ordering this since an old couple next to us raved how good it was.  Sure the apples were good.  The cheese by itself was good.  But the flavors collectively were just ok.  Again, a dish not worth $15.  5) Bone Marrow with oxtail jam, pickled orange rind, sea salt, parsley salad = $12 = The ONLY dish that was worth what we paid for.  The flavor of the fatty bone marrow from the long bone cut down it's long axis is incredible.    6) \"Pig Candy\" (pork belly with miso caramel sauce, apple kimchi, daikon, cilantro) = $8 = The flavor was great.  The meat could be more tender.  The size?  Just 3 small bites.  Another dish not worth the price Butcher and the Rye charges.  $8?  Maybe worth $5 at most.  Not even David Chang of Momofuku in NYC, is charging this much for his pork belly (which in my opinion is the best pork belly prepared with Asian flavors in North America).    Service (7.5/10) = Service was somewhat slow during the first opening week, and the place was crowded.  So it's understandable.    Ambiance (10/10) = Like others have mentioned, the decor of this place is damn impressive.  From the glass jars over the ceiling lights, the wooden communal tables, the fork and spoon wallpaper on the ceiling, and the giant wall of whiskey.  It's obvious a lot of effort was placed in designing this new restaurant, with close attention to detail.  I can't remember the last time I gave a 10/10 for a restaurant's ambiance.     Overall opinion = While the decor is amazing, the food is lackluster and way overpriced.  As I mentioned, I don't have a problem dropping $$$$ for incredible food. I've done it at 3-star Michelin restaurants.  I've done it many times at high end places in cities such as San Francisco and NYC.  However, $10 for a small bowl of forgettable cauliflower?  $8 for a small slice of pork belly that's not even cooked to perfection?  Even if the prices were reasonable, I still wouldn't give this place more than 3 Yelp stars.  If for some reason I visit this restaurant again, the only thing I will order is the bone marrow and a beer. \"Butcher and the Rye.\"  While the name catches one's attention, unfortunately the food did not catch mine in a positive way."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed the mac and cheese and my duck entree was very tasty, but what I enjoyed most were the cocktails. I prefer a bit sweeter cocktails and these fit the bill. The Nauti-Mule was my favorite. The pig candy and bone marrow were great. The bone marrow was a new experience for me and it was better than I expected!"}
{"text":"Food was really good and the cocktails were even better. We sat upstairs overlooking the bar which was a neat perspective watching the bartenders climb the ladder to snag bottle from way up above. Nice server experience overall but at times aloof after she brought cocktails.   I made a reservation for 9PM since this was the earliest available for a Friday night. We showed up at 8:20 hoping they would be able to seat us and they could, yay! When we walked in about half of the tables were empty...?? They definitley need to get a new reservation system or specialist since they are losing a LOT of money with this approach."}
{"text":"A group of four of us enjoyed a pretty tasty early dinner this past November. This place is popular, so we had to make the reservation on the early side. It was for sure full when we got there.   It was a weird but interesting place for a date night, what with the velvet walls and taxidermy theme stuff. The playlist was funky and enjoyable, if a little loud. We had a good time.   To start, we had the cheese board ($16), rusted duck brodo ($10) and the cauliflower with roasted farro, romanesco, baby carrots, pine nuts, brown butter, and harissa yogurt ($10). The brodo was a bit over salted for my tastes, though my husband was happy with it. I was a really big fan of the cauliflower--the farro gave it a really nice earthiness and the harissa yogurt a nice kick.   The men at the table also shared the pig candy ($8, pork belly, apple kimchi, miso caramel, and cilantro), which they were for sure into.   For our entrees, two of us got the scallops over risotto, a different iteration than they have now, but similar, with a chard over it instead of being paired with asparagus. The scallops were cooked extremely well and melted in my mouth in just the right way. My husband had the pan seared halibut with greens, almonds, and a green drizzle ($29) and cleaned his plate, though agreeing that it, too, was a bit on the salty side. Our friend's husband got the roasted chicken ($26) and gave it his hearty approval.   Cocktail-wise, everyone was very happy. All were tasty and well-balanced. I had the \"ether\"  (gin + cucumber + something else), and my boo had something equally tasty with an egg white on top.  At dessert time, we got a pumpkin pie that was not really what we expected -- more like a mini pot pie than a slice of pie. It was't so great, but maybe mostly just because it didn't live up to expectations. I was in no way into the crust.   Overall, it was a nice place to share a meal with friends, but it definitely didn't blow my mind."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat and drink in the city. Great drinks and amazing food. Atmosphere is incredible"}
{"text":"I was traveling for business and wanted to stop by for a solo dinner.  I called the restaurant before going to see if they had room at the bar.  The hostess, who was very nice, mentioned  there was a private party upstairs but that I could get a drink and wait for a spot at the bar downstairs. I had a glass of wine and waited for a seat.  After a few minutes, a seat opened up. I sat down next to a very nice/talkative older couple.  I asked a female bartender if I could see a menu.  She angrily replied, \"..what? I don't have time to take care of you. As you can see I am extremely busy. You'll have to ask someone else.\" Her comment made me very uncomfortable -- especially because I had to sit directly facing her during my entire meal. The décor and ambience were great despite the awful bartender with the attitude.  I ordered the Brussels and dirty pasta. The food had great taste but was very very oily, especially the Brussels.  I recommend the pasta -- it was cooked perfectly. The sauce was ground duck, carrot and pecorino romano. Ultimately, I was disappointed by the service.  But, loved the ambiance and inside décor.  ."}
{"text":"Had a reservation and still had to wait 45 minutes a few years ago which is completely unacceptable for an upscale restaurant.   Maybe they have gotten to the place where they are less rude to their customers but I haven't been back to find out.  The bone marrow is definitely an acquired taste which I have not yet acquired!"}
{"text":"The pig candy is a must have.  The scallops were nothing short of perfection!  Cool decor!"}
{"text":"Tight quarters but large flavors abound.  We ordered small plates and our waitress Naomi was a gem to suggest and describe to perfection what we should try.  Everything was great and served very quickly.  The Pig wing wasn't huge but it was all so OH tasty. Drinks were fine and the desserts weren't huge but good.  I would go back often but I live in Houston!  Ask for Naomi."}
{"text":"Look at those orange stars. Maybe I missed something.  I am just underwhelmed. It was the thought I had for most of the night and exactly what +1 said when we left. It had that \"good, but not great\" for as much awesome praise I've heard for Butcher and The Rye. Especially after being taken to a beautiful sugar bread dream brunch at its older brother Meat and Potatoes, I wanted a spiced bread dream dinner here.  Not the case. I don't want to leave three stars as I did enjoy it, but we probably won't be back.  We made reservations, which you should probably do (and can do, right here, on this page, on Yelp!).  The place itself is a wreck of gothic damask and mixed sets of encyclopedias meets cabin full of taxidermy.  There are a few themes going on here, and it is looking rougher than Kennywood's new version of Noah's Ark. When you walk in, there are big, reclaimed wood style tables and a massive bar which is gorgeous, but upstairs is a different story (the 2nd story, that is.. ha!).  We were seated in the hell that is parties of two along the wall where even I had a hard time wedging between them--and we're a small people.  When others are eating, they do not typically want my bum on their table.  With our drinks, the Jessica Rabbit and the Frankly, My Dear, we were all right. The Jessica Rabbit was a generic gin and juice.  Frankly was a little bit (emphasis on LITTLE BIT .. it was a third of a rocks glass) of whiskey with a whole buncha sweet.  But the real deal here is supposed to be the food, right? I had been scouring the menu for over a week as I don't eat beef or pig (AKA why did you go here, lady?).  Luckily, they had the mac n cheese and focaccia for which I threw my lactose intolerance to the wind and went for it. +1 eats anything, so the pig candy and onion soup sounded great.  Everything came out in these tornados of small plates to the tiniest table.  The focaccia was all mine.  A loaf covered in onions--some cooked, some not so lucky--and not much else to note, served with a ricotta whip that could have been Philadelphia, a white bean paste which tasted exactly how it sounds, and an olive tapenade that could have been roasted red pepper mush for all I know.  I hate having no positive opinion on something, so the bread itself was not bad.  I actually did like the mac n cheese a lot, if only for the toasted shredded top.  And they were shells! Praise the pasta gods.  +1 didn't rave about anything. The candy was a square of pig, the onion soup tasted very .. earthy.  I ended up saying forget it, box up half the dinner, order another drink and dessert. The second drink was probably the worst choice of the night.  The \"10th Circle\" is listed as gin, lime, chartreuse, rosemary, ginger, curry tea. That's all.  When I received a typical looking gimlet, I was excited.  But then I found a heavy sprinkle of what I guess was cayenne on top.  Why. You forgot to tell me that part. Welcome to the 10th circle?  Probably should have seen that coming. I passed most of it off to +1.  I had been dreaming of the s'mores all day.  A scoop of fried ice cream with bourbon marshmallows and chocolate? Absolutely.  This was worth it.  Everything else didn't hit it off with me.  I actually recommend to come here for just dessert.  I wonder if they serve ice cream at the bar."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure I had the best scallop dish of my life here. I can't be 100% sure because I was already two whiskey drinks deep. The drinks were great, service was great, and the food was served up surprisingly quickly. It was a truly stellar meal.   I don't even mind the rich hipster hunting cabin vibe they have going on. I do mind the seating, though. There's one of those long booths along the back wall with tables really packed in. I was seated at the booth and had to squeeze between our table and our neighbor's table in order to exit. I'm an average sized human and it was very difficult to maneuver without knocking things around. I understand that restaurants want to optimize space but I found it to be uncomfortable. I'm also not a fan of the whole communal table fad that's been going around but that's only because I'm a boring introvert who doesn't enjoy small talk."}
{"text":"Excellent service, food 'meh', atmosphere quirky, shoe-horned in a corner with a mounted deer directly over my food not very appealing."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere at this place.  Always busy and they have different items on the menu that you don't normally see at other places.  They also have some nice drinks and if you are a whiskey lover this place is right up your alley.  Highly recommend this place and would suggest getting a reservation."}
{"text":"Eclectic place, eclectic menu, awesome execution! Had the dry aged steak tartare and the hanger steak (Pittsburgh Rare) Possibly the best steak ever in terms of flavor and texture. Service was efficient without feeling hurried,I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Everything was incredible here. The service was great; my server was very knowledgeable regarding whiskey and answered all of our questions and more. The food was excellent as well. I'd have to say this was one of the best craft cocktail / whiskey focused restaurants I've been too."}
{"text":"Service was quite good.  Entrees were delicious but don't order the pork shank unless you're having an appetizer.  It took 45 minutes from order to delivery.  Waiter commented that it takes longer for that entree making me wish he had said that when I placed the order.  And definitely don't order the chocolate cake dessert, awful.  Not only did it taste bad, it was $9 for what amounted to two small bites.  Now that I've eaten at both Butcher and the Rye and Meat and Potatoes, my opinion is that unless you dying for cassoulet, there are other restaurants with better food choices."}
{"text":"We love staying downtown Pittsburgh and trying new places to eat....and this one DOES NOT disappoint.  The service was fantastic and the food divine.  Everyone in our party raved about the food---I had scallops that were super tasty!!  Located right downtown this place is easy to walk to from most hotels.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went to Butcher in the Rye first time for a work happy hour meeting. Wondered if all the hype was accurate. We got to sit outside, but sitting downtown right alongside the road wasn't the best with all of the cars and pedestrians passing by. Waitress was very kind and didn't rush us. Cabernet for me, malbec for colleague. We split the brussel sprouts, wow were they deliciously unique. Highly recommend. Also ordered the foccacia bread, which came with 3 different spreads. Was enough food for us, and we enjoyed the overall experience. Next time, Tako!"}
{"text":"Some of the best food I've ever tasted. Try the deep friend Brussels, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this 5 stars before even having a true full meal there. I've had snacks at the bar along with drinks and everything has been off the charts... the food, the drinks... and the bartenders are so fun to talk to! Very conversational and friendly, all while juggling making sure everyone at the bar is happy... and they seem to balance it with charm and wit. Keep up the good work, guys! And will update when I join for a full dinner sometime soon.  The mac and cheese is AMAZING for the record..."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Highly recommend if you're a meat lover! If not, I'd skip this place. Definitely not vegetarian friendly.  Ambiance is romantic and has a creepy- but cool- theme. Dimly lit and close quarters for eating. A nice place to dress up for!"}
{"text":"Charcuterie was delicious and unique.  The food was interesting and delicious without being too weird.  The atmosphere was great and the staff was knowledgeable and attentive.  The ambience was very nice."}
{"text":"I came here after I saw the great reviews it had on Yelp. This place did not disappoint. I started with the pig candy which is pork belly with kimichi apples and a caremelized sauce. It was so perfect great balance of sweet and salty. For my entire I had the lobster and pig ear parpadelle this again was perfect with juciy lobster pieces and crunch pig skin on top. The cocktails are also great, they are mainly whiskey based ."}
{"text":"3.5 for food 4 for the drink experience so maybe 3.75 stars overall...for the price of it all I expected more.  I ordered the scallops which were tasty but for $30 I expected more than 4 scallops and more flavor.  Honestly I thought that the appetizers were better than my main dish. We got the Brussels, cheese plate, and pork belly. Drinks were fun and very good. Our waitress was very knowledgeable when it came to suggesting a whisky for my old fashion.  Also there's something intriguing about a whisky bar with such an extensive selection the menu is on an ipad. That being said I will say drinks felt overpriced as well.  $45 for a 1 oz pour of JW blue label  (A high end blended scotch) is steep so I found it hard to believe that's not the case for the other selections."}
{"text":"LOVE the ambiance of this place! Different levels and awesome decor. You can tell they really paid attention to detail with this place. It's a cosy spot and the service we received at the upstairs bar was great!  We just tried a few small dishes and a round of cocktails. The octopus didn't blow our minds and the drinks were a little expensive for the size. But, the pig candy was delicious. I would totally come back - give this place a shot!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Great menu. Great cocktails. Great service. Ordered the flank steak and it was delicious. Had a very wonderful time."}
{"text":"Overall, delicious experience.  The pig wing appetizer was very tasty. My flank steak entree was cooked perfectly and would highly recommend it.  My fiance' had the smoked short ribs which were very disappointing; would not recommend.  Pistachio pot-de-creme was top notch.  Cocktails were very good. Our server directed us in a great direction on several occasions.   Service was very good."}
{"text":"This place is always packed and a reservation at a normal hour is almost impossible - which is a GOOD thing! The more a place is in demand the better it is and this place is no exception. The bar is top notch, the food is great, the wait staff is ready and waiting and - if I can recommend the dirty pasta to anyone I will. Seating is a little strange but don't let that stop you from checking it out."}
{"text":"Interesting plates that are elegant and a good opportunity to try things you can't find in normal restaurants. Not the biggest portions, but they taste very good. I had the bone marrow and lamb neck. Both were very good.   They also have a large whiskey selection."}
{"text":"Finally, we  able to try the latest from Meat and Potatoes team and it definitely lived up to the hype.Our food was great.Though that was a given since Rick is one of the best. What really blew me away was the decor! It is was as good as it gets. Great job. I can't wait to return"}
{"text":"Went here the other day for some drinks. I have to say that they all were delicious and quite creative. I did not get any food so I hope some day I am able to make it back for some food and drinks. It is more expensive, but the drinks are very delicious and the atmosphere is different in a good way."}
{"text":"I can't really recommend this restaurant. Maybe the hype, or perhaps not many good restaurants in the town, or just a bad first experience. My review follows if you want to continue on. If you're already outraged, stop reading.   My first night in Pittsburgh - just arrived from Philadelphia. We asked the concierge at the hotel if we could get into this restaurant and she had a good relationship with the maitre d. He had a table outside if we could come right away. We did. He asked us to sit at the bar while the table finished up. No problem, we like to sit at the bar before dinner. Good things to say about the bar - attentive, great drinks.   Time passes and the maitre 'd makes two more stops saying can't get people out of their seats. Funny thing though, saw an empty table outside when we arrived. Last time through, maitre 'd tells us a couch In a bar upstairs has space. We agree, and it's one of those things you kick yourself for later. Waiter nice, but totally uncomfortable for dinner and they forgot to put in our entrees.  Chicken was good, rabbit undercooked. They rushed it out.   Very expensive night, fair food, poor dining experience. This is the second restaurant in 2 different cities where the bar was ok and dining poor. I think I'm going to stick with tapas  at good bars. Better odds."}
{"text":"This place was FANTASTIC! Super cool vibe. Everything was so great! I got the vodka cocktail not too sweet, grape fruity, just delicious. We ordered 4 \"small plates\" it was plenty of food. We had the pate. Smooth, creamy heaven. The Mac and cheese i would marry. The pork candy, which is really like pork fat with a little crunch on the outside. Just melts in your mouth so good. And the beef carpaccio. It has a duck egg on top with a bit of truffle oil. Not usually a huge fan of carpaccio but this was amazing. Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Food was good and atmosphere was  very unique for Pittsburgh. Went here for our wedding anniversary before a show at Heinz Hall. Very trendy and a place people go to be seen or to say I've been there. Prices are high to make it a regular spot but would go back for a special night on the town. I recommend the pig candy and brussel sprouts. Try the duck liver if you can get past what it is. So rich and creamy! Want to give this place 4 stars but couldn't based on the cost. I expected the bill to be higher but $200 for a few small plates and a few drinks is a lot."}
{"text":"Meh. We won't be back. The food was ok, definitely not what I was expecting after reading the reviews.   Our dinner got off to a bad start as soon as we were led to our table. The table was so small and we were sandwiched between two other couples on each side. It was uncomfortable and certainly not what I had intended when setting up a date night for my husband and me.    The appetizers were good, not amazing, but good. We ordered the pig wing and burrata. Not much to say about these really.   My husband ordered the butcher burger. He was unimpressed. I ordered the scallops and blue crab rissoto. The scallops were well cooked but the rissoto was bland.   The plates are rather small, so we had room for dessert. I ordered the flourless chocolate cake and my husband ordered the carrot cake. If you want a cake that doesn't taste like carrots and has a lot of orange flavor - order the carrot cake. If you want a hunk of fudge and not cake - order the flourless chocolate cake.   I will say, the waitress was very nice and the decor was cool. Possibly if you come with more than two people a better dinning experience may be had. The tight seating and small tables were really a hard thing for us to get over."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was wonderful. Unfortunately the meal does not hold up to the expensive pricing."}
{"text":"Totally awesome food. Our party of three ordered a pig wing, zucchini bread with jam, mac and cheese, summer salad and roasted cauliflower to share.  They were all great, but we especially loved the mac and cheese.  These small plates were the perfect amount to share.  I appreciated being able to find a dry rose wine by the glass that worked with everything.  Wish I lived in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"bone marrow and octopus. now that's what i call a good bunch of small plates. couples with bourbon cask lager. excellent.  my parsley salad is better. and i would have included a few toast points."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the most overrated restaurant I've ever been to. From the $10 salad that was smaller than a side salad and had no taste to the $30 bland pasta to the tiny \"measured\" pours of whiskey. Awful experience. I asked the bartender what his favorite whiskey is. He tells me Bookers Rye. We were talking proof and I knew Bookers was high because I've had it before. What he failed to tell me was when he muttered 100 in a noisy restaurant he wasn't talking proof to my surprise. He was actually saying $100 per ounce. When I ordered another, he again didn't say a word. Not until my bill comes do I notice that the bill is $200 more for two 1oz shots. The entire bottle is $300 upon using google. Maybe train your bartenders to let people know when they're paying that high a price for a single 1oz pour and confirm it. Hell it didn't even get poured to the top of your little measuring contraption. Thanks for the suggestion pal! I'll never recommend this place. Train your bartenders to maybe not suggest $100 shots when an average out of towner wants to try different things. This isn't normal. Oh and for anyone who comes here, make sure you ask your bartenders how much their overpriced ridiculous prices of whiskey is before it's served. Thanks for the half ass \"Oh. Sorry\" when I was shocked by the bill too."}
{"text":"I make sure to bring all of my guest to this restaurant and bar. I must admit, I have never ordered food here, just drinks. And I keep returning for drinks. Once you walk into the restaurant, you are greeted by a \"beauty and the beast style library\" of alcohol, there are shelves upon shelves of whiskeys and burbons that require a sliding ladder to reach. I have always been impressed every time with the sheer volume of alcohol knowledge that their bartenders have. I take my visiting friends here and we have always had a great time!"}
{"text":"I've had a lot of great meals in Pittsburgh, but this one might take the cake. I think it starts with their amazing service. Our server, James, was incredibly passionate about the restaurant and gave us a brief backstory as well as his recommendations. Everything he said to try was amazing. Both of us had a nauti mule to start (get this if you like ginger/can handle a bit of spice). The brussel sprouts? The pig candy? Fahgetaboutit. So good. For our entrees, we had the dirty pasta and the rabbit coq au vin because we wanted to try something different and both dishes were packed with super delicious flavors and great portion sizes. Because this place is, arguably, more of a food experience, I'd recommend dessert too. We had deconstructed s'mores with deep fried ice cream.  This is an incredible date spot. Between the sexy atmosphere, the kick ass food, and the service, you could be there for a few hours enjoying yourself and not even realize!"}
{"text":"My review for Butcher and the Rye may be slightly skewed since I went there over 6 months ago. I had the opportunity to try Meat and Potato's sister restaurant for a friend's birthday. My first impression of the place was not great. Our reservations were pretty late and when we showed up, we had to wait another half hour for our table. Upon arrival at our table, there were multiple empty tables around us so we were confused about our long wait time. The food style is more avant garde than Meat and Potatoes with smaller portion sizes (which is how Butcher and the Rye is advertised). It may be because I am biased toward Meat and Potatoes but I was not impressed by the quality of the food and the value of the dishes. If you haven't experienced Meat and Potatoes, I would go there first before trying out their sister restaurant. If I come here again, I will update my review to see if my opinion was reinforced or changed."}
{"text":"I was in awe of the interior as we were lead to our table upstairs. I was surprised by how dark the lighting was inside, and there was just enough light for our late thirties eyes to read the menus. I will admit it was a bit fun trying to hold the lit candle up to the menus trying to make our drink selections we were so excited for. The antler chandelier we were seated next to, and the wall of spirits as you walk in were showstoppers as well.  Appetizers  She drank: Morning Glory (Bulleit Rye / Hennessy VS / Cointreau / Absinthe / Angostura Bitters / Sparkling Wine) He drank: Salingers Sling (Bulleit Bourbon / Grand Marnier / Demerara / Coffee Bitters) We ate: Rustic Bread - pan gravy / lard / black pepper / sage, and Brussels - brown butter / dill / parmigiano reggiano / preserved lemon aioli.  We started the evening with some drinks and appetizers, which were so good, SO good. If you ever go, get the brussel sprouts. The crunchy, roasted brussel sprouts most definitely should be enjoyed with the aioli. The lemon aoli cuts the saltiness of the prepared brussels (try by themselves if you like), and makes them taste divine. The rustic bread and pan gray reminded me of Thanksgiving or what I imagine a homey Sunday dinner to be. Everything was seasoned just right when enjoyed with the other items on the plate.  Main Course  She drank: Bee's Knees  (Hendrick's Gin / Lemon / Honey) He drank: Blackthorn (The Irishman's Founder's Reserve / Sweet Vermouth / Angostura Bitters / Copper & King's Absinthe) We ate: Seared Scallops served over blue crab risotto with asparagus, chanterelles, and capers. Hanger Steak with charred spring onion, potato croquettes, asparagus, green garlic, and red wine jus.  I really enjoyed the Bee's Knees, but I wish I had started with this drink. It was a bit too sweet for the scallops and risotto, but the lemon did lightly compliment the seafood. In retrospect, I think the Morning Glory would have been a better pairing.  The risotto topped with seared scallops was so insanely delicious and expertly cooked I am still...STILL thinking about it months later. The asparagus and chanterelles added a very pleasing taste as well as nice contrasting texture to the risotto and scallops.  The hanger steak entree was equally well executed in taste and textures, but I think we were all still thinking of those scallops.  We could not leave without at least trying a dessert.  Dessert (At the time of our meal, this item was an option)  She drank: Water (I did have a sip from his drink...) He drank: Kentucky Coffee Tree (Bulleit Rye / Mezcal Joven / Stumptown Cold Brew Syrup / Chocolate Bitters) We ate: S'mores (bourbon marshmallow / chocolate rope / brown butter fried ice cream / graham cracker soil  I really enjoyed the ice cream in the dessert, but there was some pieces of chocolate on the plate that straight up reminded me of astronaut ice cream. (Astronaut ice cream is a novelty, not very tasty.) I think this was our least favorite menu item."}
{"text":"Overall, I'd go back. The food was great. The environment was somewhat overwhelming - a little too hipster for me."}
{"text":"This has become our go-to \"special dinner\" place. Interesting, well executed menu. Spectacular bar. I love the seared scallops with blue crab risotto / asparagus / chanterelles / capers. Highly recommended if you're going to be in the Cultural District."}
{"text":"Colleagues came to town and selected Butcher and the Rye for dinner. Couldn't have selected a better place. Corinna, our server extraordinaire, offered the perfect choices for bourbon, cocktails and beer. If you come here, ask for Corinna, she won't steer you wrong. Phenomenal appetizers, entree's and atmosphere. Dessert could use some assistance, but who needs dessert anyway. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with the food and the service here.  I can't recommend it highly enough!"}
{"text":"My friends and I came here to celebrate my birthday. I made reservations well in advance since I know it's hard to get a table here. We started off with the steak tartare, pig candy, Brussels sprouts, and the Shishito peppers. All of the appetizers were great but the steak tartare and Brussels sprouts definitely stood out. They are a must. I had a Caesar salad and the scallops for my entree. Both were very good. The blue crab risotto that came with the scallops was fantastic. Our service was great as well. My only complaint is that we were seating at a table up front which made it hard to hear because the bar was so crowded and loud. I will definitely be making a return visit though."}
{"text":"Cool decor but wait service and some of the guests seemed a little snoody. Definitely expensive with small portions. They said they were full and needed reservations but the entire place had empty tables the entire time we were there (2hrs). We ended up sitting upstairs at the bar."}
{"text":"Absolutely love their food and menu. Everything I tried was delicious and wasn't overly expensive. This is also a great place to go with a group because they have long bench like tables in the main area."}
{"text":"We made 10:30pm dinner reservations on Saturday, for my Dad's birthday dinner. It was the only time they had available for a table of 5. Needless to say we were all very hungry. We arrived early hoping to get seated a little quicker, and they sat us just after 10pm. Perfect.  The interior is undoubtedly cool. So much detail! It really makes you forget that you're really sitting downtown Pittsburgh. We were seated at a table upstairs and had a great view of the antler chandelier. Loved the rustic cabin vibe.  Unfortunately, it wasn't an exceptional experience and the atmosphere couldn't override some of the issues. It was literally 80 degrees at our table and the A/C was off. The staff was sweating, we were sweating, the patrons at the tables around us were sweating and I have no idea why there was no air on! It was a 90 degree day! I heard people ask for the A/C to be cranked, but nothing ever changed. It was cooler at Heinz Field sitting in the sun the next day. Absolutely miserable! It was also so loud!! You could barely hold a conversation over the music.  We had the cheese platter as an appetizer. It was okay. Definitely not large enough for 5 people, but we kind of knew that. The waitress recommended me the Bee's Knees as a great drink, but I wasn't crazy about it. My Mom felt the same about the drink she ordered and they were really small for being $12 each. I ordered the Seared Scallops and really liked it! Everyone else also liked their food, but didn't really love it. My Dad capped off the meal with Strawberry pie. Same result. I think if we were comfortable the food would have gone over much better.   Service was on the slow side. Long waits in between courses and the check. Our waitress was super nice and attentive with the water though!   Just very hard for me to stomach paying hundreds on a nice dinner, when it wasn't that enjoyable. On the positive side, I think I sweat out 5lbs. of water weight. All jokes aside, I'd like to give it a second chance some day. It seems our experience wasn't the norm and people seem to love it. However, I don't think I'll hurry to make a reservation anytime soon."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and have concluded that I enjoy the atmosphere and the drinks but am continually unimpressed with the food.  They do make a good sazerac (if it were a smidge less sweet, I would say it's great), a really unique and delicious manhattan, and good punch specials.  I'll definitely have to try a Boulevardier or Vieux Carré the next time I'm here!  At dinner tonight, we split the charcuterie platter, which was fine but (in my opinion) overpriced.  The $12 platter at Cure serves up almost the same variety, and frankly, the charcuterie is better at Cure.  There were two items on this platter that were downright bad, and we didn't even finish them between the four of us.  The pig wing was pretty decent (and one of the better value items, as a small plate). The meat is cooked perfectly, and the sauce is very flavorful -- maybe even too much so, as I found the the sweetness and saltiness to be a bit intense.  However, it's pretty basic -- a sweet, sticky, fish-saucey asian style sauce.  There is nothing much else going on with the dish to write home about.  My friend thought her scallops were delicious, and I agree that the sauce was nice based on what I tried.  Another friend had the ground duck pasta and enjoyed its flavor, although it looked too rich and cheesey for my tastes.  I get that it is supposed to be a rustic dish, but for the price tag I would expect something a little more refined.  My boyfriend had the skirt steak, which I tried.  It was bland and uninventive, and the mini-rice cakes were straight up burnt.  Inedibly burnt.  At a restaurant trying to be at this calibre, this should not happen.  If you are the chef and you burn part of the dish, that dish should not be sent out until the problem is fixed.  Our server was nice, though, and took his cocktail off the bill.  But I would have rather he gotten to have an enjoyable dinner.  They had a very delicious-sounding burger on the menu, but they were sold out of it for the night.  We ordered it at 8pm and the server said it was sold out well before 7pm.  WHAT?  If the servers are so aware of this issue, could the restaurant not arrange to remediate this problem?  Even if it were a matter of limited ingredients... then serve the special on fewer nights.  It is ludicrous to be dining at peak dinner time and be told that the dish you want has repeatedly been sold out by 7pm every night -- apparently in order to dine later than that and get the burger you have to also \"reserve\" the burger when you make your table reservation. Again, WHAT?!  For this kind of hype and $18, it better be one hell of a burger.  Unfortunately, I am not going to go through the trouble to find out.  Finally, I have tried the mussels here during a previous visit and they were not impressive. I also tried to order just a side of bread to dip in the remaining mussel sauce, and they brought me (and charged me for) one of the foccacia-with-dips dishes. Totally not what I had in mind or wanted to pay for, but those dips were pretty tasty at least.  For a place that has experienced so much hype, has been so hard to get a reservation at, and carries such a hefty price tag, I expected *way* better food.  I would give the food 2 stars if you factor in value.  I think the drinks, atmosphere, and service are good and I would for sure come back for just the bar."}
{"text":"I really want to like Butcher and the Rye, but I just don't. I've been twice and both times it was a total circus--and not in a fun way. A reservation is a must and it is a challenge to even pop in for a drink without one. I like the concept and think the whisky wall is neat and trendy, but when you look beyond the smoke and mirrors, you see that the food is good, but not great and realize you have no personal space and are paying a 300% bar markup. The staff here is very pretentious (hipstery kind of pretentious) and they made me feel unwelcome on both visits. Not just your typical 'bad service', but I felt like every staff member I interacted with was borderline hostile.  Some of the food is quite good,  portions can be small for some items and everything I have tried has been SUPER salty (I love salt, so for me to notice added salt means it is over-the-top salty). In my opinion, there are many better options in the area where you can get better food and drink (maybe not better whisky options) minus the attitude and expense."}
{"text":"Our meal at Butcher and Rye may well be our best meal of 2018 (pretty bold statement since the year is only half passed AND it's been a solid 3 months since we ate said meal).    I spent a lot of time pondering Yelp reviews and menus trying to pick a place for dinner our final night in Pittsburgh.  We've done so many of the usuals, yet haven't found that place that makes that meal you want every time you visit a city.  This. Is. It.  There were no reservations available, so we decided to take our chances and arrive at opening hoping to snag bar seats (our preferred location, anyway).  We arrived 5-10 minutes before opening and there was already a bit of a line, but we were still able to (easily) snag bar seats.    The bartender was fantastic and super helpful answering questions both about the menu and about bourbon (list is stellar, yet ridiculously overpriced:  you can find a comparable list, at close to 1/2 the pour price at Carmella's Plates and Pints on the south side.  You're welcome.)  We started with the Sunday Gravy and all those other reviewers who've championed it are right.  And I hate when that happens, as I'm always skeptical of the \"masses\".  They're right.    I had the scallops with blue crab risotto and I still routinely dream about this meal.  That hard sear, that creamy risotto... I was so enamored with my meal, I forget what my husband ate (though I'm sure I had at least a bite).  He says he had the filet and it, too, was delicious.    I love great food.  I hate paying top dollar for subpar \"fancy\".  This is great food worth every penny (note, I said \"food\", not \"bourbon\" ;) ).    We will be back."}
{"text":"The experience started off a bit questionable. We were sat in leather swivel chairs that sat very low to the table and it was very dark in the restaurant and hard to read the menu at first.  But...  that all changes once you give it a couple of minutes.  You're eyes adjust to the light bringing a very personal experience to the conversation and meal.  The seating was cozy and allowed for you to relax.  We did not wait for our table even coming earlier than our reservation was scheduled for and the staff were knowledgeable and friendly, even snapping a few pictures for us.  The food was fantastic, each piece of meat cooked to perfection with perfect pairings of the sides.  It was an overall great experience and one of the best restaurants I've had the pleasure of dining at in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"This review is based on the experience only, as we came in just for drinks, for the first time. We were seated at a table and ordered and got our drinks. The tables have little oil lamps on them, our flame was a little \"stronger\" than the ones on other tables. A server made a beeline for us and proceeded to reprimand US for the candle while grabbing and turning down the oil. Apparently he assumed we turned it up. The rest of the time there was uncomfortable because he was standing telling the other servers about us, they all kept staring. I would not return here purely because of the way I was treated here. If he thought the candle was too much, I get it, come fix it, but don't get snippy with me when I did nothing wrong. Rude."}
{"text":"The scallops dish was phenomenal! Service was friendly and attentive. Smaller portions, but it was a perfect sized meal for me."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times.  Great place for before theater drinks and food.  Good service.  Nice range of beverages.  Food well displayed.  Well managed.  Meat and Potatoes connected apparently."}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous place to bring new visitors to Pittsburgh..heaving with vitality and atmosphere - even on a Tuesday night!  Service and food,  great!!"}
{"text":"This place has got it figured out.  The food is amazing.  The drinks are unique with an enormous liquor selection.  The service was very professional and cool and welcoming.  And the space is gorgeous.  We will return."}
{"text":"Troy was awesome. This place was great. Ask for recommendations. You'll be happy you did."}
{"text":"The cocktails here are great. Not good, they are great! Alison our bartender was AMAZING. Best old fashion in Pittsburgh!!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for a date night. I had the best naute mule there and my boyfriend loved the Manhattan. I highly recommend the dirty pasta as an entire and Sunday gravy as well as the fried octopus for an app. I'll be going back for sure !"}
{"text":"One of my the best restaurants that I have eaten in Pittsburgh. Started off with a great bottle of Cabernet for an average price then led off with a pork wing. It was Sooo good, wish they offered more than just one. The bread with the gravy and butter was superb. The service was great even though the food came out longer than usual but it was worth it. I ordered the dirty pasta which had mashed up duck and noodles. Absolutely delicious, highly recommended. My fiancé ordered the rabbit which I have never had before, very unique and delicious. Overall I would say that this place is pricy but well worth it. Excellent"}
{"text":"Everything at Butcher and the Rye was excellent. Very high quality dishes that were perfectly prepared.  We started with the brussels as an appetizer. The preserved lemon aioli was a nice twist compared to other restaurants' brussels dishes. Our cocktails included the Wild Kind, Salinger's Sling, and Nauti-Mule, a delicious spin on a Moscow Mule with the addition of jalapeno to add a kick to it.  The grilled filet had outstanding flavor. The seasonal salad was tasty, but smaller than expected. Our server recommended the dry aged tartare multiple times, and it didn't disappoint. The kitchen kindly substituted chips for bread as a gluten-free option.  All in all, it was a great upscale dining experience in Pittsburgh. Would love to return."}
{"text":"Terrible \"welcome\" staff ruined our evening. They are paying two people to do a worse job than zero people there. Had a reservation, but we left after waiting for about half an hour without a table in sight. I don't care how good the food is; if you have any respect for yourself and guests, go somewhere that provides service rather than pretension."}
{"text":"First time in Pittsburgh and I was coming for work...spoke at a local conference. One of my buddies back home told me I needed to try this place. Heard they had the best Old Fashioned in town. The low light rustic vibe made me almost forget my purpose there. I almost ran into a table I was looking around so much trying to drink in all my eyes could handle.   It was too cool to be hipster but too hip to be retro so I'd place this lounge in a category all its own. I made it to the upstairs bar and ordered my old fashioned. It was in fact delicious, not too sweet not too bitter just right! After ordering a second choice and leaving it up to the bartender I was brave enough to dive into the food selection.   This dry aged tartare was so interesting with all the flavor combinations and yet I couldn't stop eating it. Simply delicious. Was thinking about that meal and those drinks the rest of my trip. Thanks for surpassing expectations...we need a place like yours out west."}
{"text":"Loved it! Sat upstairs right next to the bar overlooking the whiskey wall, they bring you an iPad if you'd like to peruse the different kinds they have .. We tried several smoky 30-40$ shots , very strong!! Lol..I also had an absinthe drink which included gin, could not finish my 2nd one , very potent..the music ranged from Michael Jackson to what I swear was old dirty bastard to jazz lol.. It was a bit loud upstairs ..one annoying factor was that while making drinks the bartenders would pound on ice(?) with a mallet, could do without that..    Our waitress was Sara and after taking our initial orders for drinks and an appetizer she disappeared for 20 min ( we chose the charcuterie ) It was very tasty but I can't honestly tell you what the meats or sides were even though they were explained ( again a bit loud in there ). She forgot to bring my guests beer but we did not end up having to pay for it.  It was during her absence that we wished to try several more shots and she missed out on the opportunity to make more $ .   I ordered the scallops and blue crab risotto and it did not disappoint with its crunchy asparagus on top. Perfectly cooked and scrumptious. My guest had the hangar steak and it was wonderfully cooked. We also ordered apple pie for desert and a coffee flavored creme pot..again very fresh and awesome taste .   We will definitely be back to try some different food next time and more whiskey.. Very nice place for a romantic dinner ..or to chat and get drinks with the girls.."}
{"text":"Would get 5 stars if the food menu were a little more diverse or changed more often. If you like bourbon and whiskey, this is your place. It is small and can get loud, so if you are not into that be wary when coming during busy bar hours. Fantastic cocktails and whiskey flights, great bar and wait staff. Food is good."}
{"text":"My husband and I celebrated our one year wedding anniversary at Butcher and the Rye last night. We were really impressed with the service, the drinks and the food!   We had the pig candy and the bone marrow starters, both were extremely delicious! My entree was the Dirty Pasta which was incredible! I had the same dish in Italy a few weeks ago and the dirty pasta was just as good!! My husband had the lamb neck. He thought it was a little too smokey. The beans, greens, feta and mint served with it were amazing!   We finished the night off with some absinthe and it was definitely a show!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars ... Good service and fun vibe place but the food was a bit more miss than hits for me.   Looking for an restaurant that had an interesting menu and great service in the downtown core, yelp quickly pointed to a few restaurants and Butcher and Rye popped up with its near perfect score.  I can see it being one of the more popular downtown Pittsburgh places... it has a fun vibe.  One thing I noticed when we arrived was that the restaurant was only 75% filled but there's no reservations left available online.  So for anyone thinking there's no seating even on a Friday night, you probably would be pleasantly surprised if you called in to see if there is a table available.  When you walk in, you immediately notice the bar area and the incredibly huge wall of bottles.  There's 3 levels to the restaurant and each level and spot has an unique and arresting visual to keep you looking around.  You can spot the large antler chandelier or tall standing bear or even the head of a pig.  Think of it as a hunter's man cave who happens to like their rye... correction: LOVES their rye.  Possibly bathes in it.  The staff here is friendly and informative of all items on the menu.  It was recommended to look at the menu as a sharing plate style and to have a few small plates and one or two large plates depending on how starved we are.  We ended up ordering their special crispy octopus, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, and dirty pasta.    Crispy Octopus - It was offered on their special menu and seeing how I will miss the Tako octopus, this sounded like a good option.  It came with two medium sized tentacles with a nice crispy shell on it.  It was pretty easy to cut through with the butter knife and it was nicely tender.  The sides that came with it had great texture.... crispy shell covering a tender creamy block, soft chick peas, and perhaps a wilted grilled leek.  Compared to the octopus, i found the sides to be quite light on flavour and underseasoned.  The leek or spring onion had flavour but the creamy block (polenta?) had very little flavour.  I think the octopus was very good but the sides kinda left the dish a little underwhelming.  3.5/5 (4 for the octopus though!)  Brussel Sprouts - Super deep bronzed crispy sprouts were under a mountain of Parmesan cheese and dill.  There was an aioli on the bottom that was supposedly flavoured with lemon.  This was another great textural dish but could be seasoned a bit more. Even the parmesean didn't quite save the dish from being light on flavour.  3.5/5  Cauliflower - This looked super spicy as it arrived with a nice red colour but there wasn't any heat to it once you took a bite.  The cauliflower was crispy and was accompanied with farro grains, pine nuts, and a smear of harrisa.  Overall, I loved how you got crunch, crispy bit, and a tender cauli.  I wish the harissa was a bit stronger as I found the flavour not very strong.  3.5/5  Dirty Pasta - Al dente long open tubes pasta carrying a rich sauce of pecorino, ground duck, and finely diced carrots.  The sauce was very rich texture and lovely but opposite of the previous 3 dishes, it was incredibly salty.  I'm not sure if all the salt arrived from the other 3 dishes or the pecorino was heavy handed.  3/5  Overall, the service was good and had a great atmosphere.  Just unfortunately the dishes and kitchen wasnt quite wowing us.  The other odd thing was that they delivered all 3 small plates within minutes of each other and we didnt have any room for the 3rd plate.  They had to remove our drinks to fit it.  So I wish I could say its a 4 stars but not quite for us this time."}
{"text":"It was ok, but I don't understand why everyone raves about this place.  I think it was better when they first opened.  It seems like now that they have a following, they are not trying as hard.  If they think they can get away with just ok food, and not so great service, they won't last long.    There were five of us for dinner on Sayurday night.  For appetizers we got the brussels sprouts, pig wings, mussels, and foccacia.  The sprouts were good but I've had better.  The mussels were also ok, but lacked flavor, and the focaccia was good but standard.  Our dinners were the same.  Good but nothing exceptional.  The macaroni and cheese was really, really bland.  Our server also lacked personality and everything we needed (that she should have brought without asking) seemed to be an effort.  I can understand when they are busy, but it was early on Saturday night and the servers had time to stand around and talk.  I guess our server didn't like having her conversation with the other servers interupted to please a customer.  Drinks were good though.  I enjoyed the whiskey."}
{"text":"My go to restaurant for any celebration. Their food is incredible and the bartenders make excellent specialty drinks. Although some items on the menu might be a little pricey, their small plates and appetizers are a great deal. I personally recommend their Focaccia with 3 dipping sauces or their Homemade Bread with Pan Dripping Gravy. The ambiance is excellent, just be prepared to wait for a table on weekend evenings."}
{"text":"This place is a splurge but totally worth it! We had the house made charcuterie board and a few small plates (Crispy Pig Wing & Caulifower and farro) and we were satisfied. The atmosphere is very trendy and hipster. I would definitely come here again! Note: extra bread for the charcuterie board is free!"}
{"text":"I'll preface this review with the warning that I cannot judge the restaurant for their whiskey offerings -- I can only speak to the quality of the food.   I ordered the braised rabbit which was poorly cooked and poorly seasoned. The salt monster definitely got me on this dish! The dish also lacked a general cohesiveness (though it is hard to balance a rabbit dish that is overly-seasoned). The undercooked accompanying vegetables could not hold up to the hearty protein.   I can see the appeal, especially if someone is looking to impress on a first date. I think the quality of food for the price they demand is incredibly insulting. Perhaps others were intimidated by the impressive decor (and whisky wall) and overlooked the integrity of the food.   Also why is it so dark in here?"}
{"text":"The food was great and inventive.  First time I have had dandelion greens  and my hanger steak was perfectly cooked and seasoned.   The Bourbon options were amazing.  Service was helpful and quick."}
{"text":"Good restaurant with really interesting cocktails and entrees. However, be careful with the bourbon selection here. We had a large group and the waiter was recommending $100+ glasses of bourbon without noting the cost, which is very unprofessional for a nice restaurant."}
{"text":"Went here for my boyfriends birthday. They have a crazy whisky selection at this place. We did several small plates , salad and desert. The food was by far the best food I've ever tasted. Our waiter josh was amazing. The only reason they're not getting a 5 star is because their drinks are a little on the pricy side with a ton of ice it them. I didn't mid the cost on the food since it's totally worth it! If your near the area I would totally recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"Great food! Good atmosphere. They even gave my husband a little birthday candle in his dessert as I had written in the reservation that it was his birthday!"}
{"text":"Before I even mention the food I want to say that the atmosphere and decor is fresh out of Brooklyn and is exactly what downtown PGH needed.   Now to the food; we had an array of four small plates (marrow, rabbit, cauliflower, salt cod). The food menu descriptions weren't entirely appetizing, but the presentation and taste exceeded our expectations ... Let's not forget about the whiskey!  The list is long and over whelming, but the wide range of origins brought a smile to my face.   If you're looking for a new place to try, add this to your list. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"As another reviewer said.. \"FAKE FANCY FOOD\".  This place is OK at best... You may like it... but only if you've never eaten outside of pittsburgh.  I have never experienced a bigger rip off in my life.  $28 dollars for 3 scallops!  $14 for a 2 piece octopus appetizer!I lived in new York city for 10 years.  I've eaten in some amazing high priced restaurants... but I've never had portions as small as they serve here.  While the food was good... if I'm only getting 3 scallops for 28 dollars.. it better be the best scallop I have ever had.  And it was not.  High prices do not make a restaurant high end.   STAY AWAY."}
{"text":"I finally got to visit Butcher and the Rye on a non-restaurant week night and they did not disappoint (although i had no doubt they would be superior!)    This place is always hopping and having reservations is highly recommended!  My friend and I go out to a new restaurant once a month - always each get an appetizer and entree - then depending on our hunger - sometimes dessert.  While we didn't get dessert this trip - the appetizers and entrees were amazing!  I got the dry aged tartare appetizer - So stinking good.  Our waitress was fantastic - as I asked what she recommended.  She suggested the bone marrow - which when I asked if it was similar to meat and potatoes - she suggested the tartare.  (Their bone marrow's are similar - so I wanted something different).    My entree was the Seared Scallops.  I've tried the dirty pasta during restaurant week - and wasn't a fan, so I was looking forward to something different.  Best.choice.ever  The scallops were like butter and melted in my mouth.  Everything else (Risotto, asparagus, and everything else) was so so SO good!  Definitely check out Butcher and the Rye - Definitely have reservations - definitely get the scallops - Definitely have some drinks."}
{"text":"As advertised!!!! A friend of mine booked these reservations and I was a little skeptical at first.  I am not a fan of random types of meat (duck, rabbit, liver, etc.) and honestly didn't know what I would eat there.  My wife also doesn't eat meat so it appeared that it would be quite a challenge.  We couldn't be more wrong.  The first impression when you walk in is a massive whiskey wall behind the bar (which is heaven to me) and the uber cool ambience.  It could only be described as a mix between rustic and industrial.  I recommend taking a look at all the cool features located around the restaurant.  The light fixtures were all different and very, very cool.  We sat on the 2nd floor at a table that consisted of a leather riveted coach and a short table (height-wise).  We sat next to the 2nd floor bar which is also cool, consisting of subway tile.  The crowd is a mix of hipsters and young business people.  The whisky list is extensive, and I was able to get one of my favorites, Balvenie 14.  We started out with a charcuterie board, brussel sprouts, and mac and cheese, all top notch.  They also have daily specials and I was able to get a seafood dish that consisted of shrimp, mussels, scallops, and clams in an awesome sauce and a some big pieces of italian bread on the side.  Really, really good for a \"meat\" place.  My wife got salmon and she loved it.  I also got a coffee and a fried apple pie for dessert (a+++++!!!).  I would go back here in a heartbeat next time I go to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Man, this place is amazing.    The cocktails are great and the food is just unbelievable.  The only downsides are that it's pricey and there aren't options for vegetarians or vegans (but you could probably guess that from their name).  I've been there four times and each time I am blown away by their food.  I recommend the scallops."}
{"text":"Great place! Fun, eclectic feel! Food good. Drinks great. Service awesome:) Came with a group of 9-awesome and fast service. Server was attentive but not smothering:)"}
{"text":"I had a delicious meal here this week! I went right when it opened on a Tuesday night with three coworkers. There is not a ton of space here, especially if you don't have a reservation, but we got seated at a communal table which we mostly took up anyways. I started with a Black Dahlia which was a super delicious cocktail with black charcoal in it. I would totally get that cocktail again. I had the Pork and Lobster Sugo which was an awesome pasta. Big chunks of lobster and homemade noodles in a delicious sauce. It was heaven. All of my coworkers really like their dishes. I would go early if you want a quiet dining experience; it was definitely louder when we left. I would absolutely go back again and try some other dishes."}
{"text":"Great waiter, great service, excellent food! Our taste buds were rewarded with great flavor!"}
{"text":"I heard so many good things about this place and was really excited to try it! The food really lived up to the hype, and the drinks were (almost too) strong. Our waitress was so nice, quick, and accommodating. We started with the cheese plate which has a selection of 4 different cheeses paired with different fruits, jams, and peanut butter. Have you ever had brie with peanut butter? You should! We also had the bone marrow- it was my first time trying marrow and I thought it was great! We finished with the scallops in risotto- it was warm and perfect and savory. 10/10 would eat again and highly recommend! -1 star because it got really loud and crazy towards the end of the night."}
{"text":"I can't say much because we didn't eat dinner here but the we had mussels and a drink and it was awesome!!! I wish I lived there so I could try it again. The mussels had a curry flavor with lamb and it was by far the best mussels I'd ever had! Their drinks were pretty solid too!"}
{"text":"Just dined there for the first time,  lived up to all the positive reviews we read.  Enjoyed the scallops and dirty spaghetti (shared), along with an appetizer of charcuterie and cheese trays and the s'more dessert.  Enjoyed the eclectic decor and atmosphere."}
{"text":"i've been here twice and i really wish they weren't always full to the brim with reservations and not even any room at the bar because i'd love to go back more. being sisters with meat and potatoes, they are very similar in \"prohibition style drinks\" and \"fancy tapas\". fancy tapas, by the way, are what i call the dishes, i'm sure they have a much better term to describe them. so, let me explain what you have to look forward to. the restaurant is rather big, but there isn't a lot of space, surprisingly. there can't be more than 15 seats at the bar, if there are even that many. there is a small bar section across from the bar where you are still sitting at stools but you just have a ledge to eat on against a wall. there are two floors, but it always seems like you're squeezing your way through to get anywhere. there is a second, smaller, bar upstairs as well. so in other words, you NEED TO MAKE A RESERVATION if you want a table or have a party larger than 2 or 3. next, let's talk decor. i LOVE the way the place is decorated. someone described it to me as being inside a wes anderson movie and i think that's a perfect description. rustic punk is another way i've described it before. and oh, that wall of whiskeys... so now let's talk drinks. prohibition style (i still don't think i know exactly what that means, but it gives me an idea of what to expect). they concentrate on whiskey but have plenty of other cocktails, a punch of the day, and a decent beer selection. last time i went i had the butcher's bride and it was great. ok, now food. when i say fancy tapas, what i mean is delicacies in small portions. the menu is separated into bread (foccaccia with bean spread, olive tepenade, and whipped parmesan for us. amazing), flatbreads, charcuterie, cheese, small plates, large plates, and desserts. almost exactly like meat and potatoes, and the items themselves are similar, although i believe butcher's menu is slightly smaller. this visit, we split the bread, pork candy (if you like bacon at all, i highly recommend), and skirt steak (i still don't know what the sides were but i loved them). i've still not made it to dessert here yet, but the smores sound yummy. finally, price. of course the place is expensive because they're fancy, serve fancy food, and super popular right now. but honestly, it's worth every penny."}
{"text":"Love this place. I've been here multiple times and have always had a great experience. Love the brussel sprouts, cocktails, and steak tartare. Highly recommend. Decor is a little weird, but you have lots to look at."}
{"text":"Atmosphere. Food. Dessert. Service.  This meal made me realize I've never tried food before. Seriously the best meal I've ever had.   Entree- Best steak, best broccoli, best combination of flavors. I actually think I had an outer body experience while eating this meal.   Steak- I was very sad when my steak was gone...shed a tear and join me because today we mourn the most legendary cow to ever live. He served his purpose though.   Desserts- How can an apple pie create a unique flavor experience in your mouth? I'm not sure, but it happened tonight. The s'more dessert makes you want extinguish all campfires around the world because they are poor excuses for how to make a s'more."}
{"text":"The evening started when we arrived for our reservation and were told that the seat had been taken by someone else. Once we were seated we ordered drinks and a appetizer. About 30 min. into waiting for our appetizer to arrive the waitress came over and informed us that they were all out of my wife's dinner choice. Finally an hour after being seated, the dinner arrived, but we never got the appetizer. The staff never came to check to see if everything was okay or if we needed anything else. If I could leave this restaurant negative stars for their service, I would."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh does not understand when a fantastic restaurant hits them.  ANY place in large cities all over the world, and Butcher and the Rye can compare.  The passion behind the design, and the thought about every last detail on the food  and drink shows within everything.    Looking around the restaurant, if you notice the attention to detail that the CHEF (yes the chef apparently is the designer..) has put into the place, you cannot help but admire his artistic abilities.    Every dish was executed great given it was their first week of opening.  Even the most simple things were beyond terrific, and no one should compare this to anything else in Pittsburgh, because it is NOT comparable.  It surpasses everything.  WILL DEFINITELY BE BACK, possibly once a week."}
{"text":"We arrived a few minutes early for our reservation, the restaurant was virtually empty, and the sour-faced host seated us in the far back corner of the restaurant next to the taxidermic bear. This was the star-removing event for an otherwise excellent meal. Butcher and the Rye has a vast menu of cocktails, which for me was not appealing because I don't drink. To my delight, they have some secret house-brewed non-alcoholic beverages that are utterly delightful. I enjoyed the lemon, herb, and apricot non-alcoholic drink, my dining partner had the basil, ginger, lime drink- also fantastic. They are small batch and delicious.   We were there during Restaurant Week, so I ordered off the Prix Fixe menu, and had the lamb belly/ tongue rillette, seafood risotto, and flourless chocolate cake. My friend had the beet salad and the regular scallops risotto. The seafood risotto was complex, briney, and multi-layered. The rillette was underspiced, I felt it could have benefitted from a smoked treatment with one of the meats. The cake was fantastic.   Our server was attentive and knowledgeable and very friendly, almost making up for the attitudinal host, who threw us similar shade as we left the restaurant. A shame to have an otherwise excellent meal bookended by her wall of snobbery."}
{"text":"Dear Butcher and the Rye,  I'm really sorry that it took me so long to meet you in person. Your cocktail program is amazing. Every single thing I ate was perfect.   I love you. I know that may sound crazy so early in our relationship, but I do. I'll probably try to move in with you in six months. Just roll with it.  Love, Lynsie"}
{"text":"Swanky and fine place to grab a cocktail! Several floors of intimate lighting, dark corners, and a wall of whiskey to impress your favorite someone.   Drinks are incredible here. So many cocktails! I saw that the rye buck, sazerac, and the manhattan were under classics (and they're my favorites!). At $10 each, they were at a nice price point, too. I was able to grab a seat at the bar, and just devour my drink and do some hardcore people watching. It's definitely a lively atmosphere with a ton of energy! Wish we could have tried the food, but I guess there's always a next time. We were there for one drink, and then we were out to explore the rest of downtown."}
{"text":"I've come here many times before for drinks at the bar and am always very impressed with the caliber of cocktail and bartender.  One of my favorite things to do is the design your own cocktail by telling them what flavor profile you want and letting them go to town.  I've never had a bad drink here.  It has taken me quite awhile to get here for the food though.  I ordered the rabbit and my husband got the carbonara.  I really enjoyed the different flavors that were in my dish and they all worked very harmoniously together, but the carbonara was to die for.  I was definitely having dish envy.   The staff is excellent and they definitely have a theme to their decor.  Quite eclectic hipster/hunter I would say.  Very interesting.  Also, if you like Whiskey - this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Awesome experience all around! Melissa was a fantastic server... She was always available and brought our food in perfect succession. The decor was modern and comfy all at the same time!  We started with the dry aged tartare ... Which ended up being my favorite thing! We then had the beet salad followed by flank steak and the hangar steak special. Everything was delicious and cooked to our specifications. We wanted to try the s'mores dessert but just ran out of room! We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My first time to The Butcher was last night and it lived up to all the hype.   The upstairs section is by far the best way to experience the best of the ambiance without too much noise from the bar.    Soon after we were seated, a whirlwind of dishes began arriving.  Although I can't remember every single dish, every dish was great and I'll name only the stand-out dishes that I can't forget.  The sea bass, some bread and the cauliflower was totally amazing.   Finally, the  macaron, cocoa coulis & mint was a perfect way to end the meal."}
{"text":"Hard to get seats here...go figure. I was lucky because I came myself and getting seats at a bar for one is pretty high. I started with their pig candy. A decent size pork belly that has a thin layer of caramel on top. Beware that it may stick to your teeth. Worth it. Also topped with cilantro and apple shavings I believe. Those really helped make the dish more refreshing. I approve. I followed up with their dirty pasta. Ground duck, brandy and thick al dente pasta. The sauce was rich but not overwhelming. But the pasta stood out the most. Maybe I just love the texture. I need to come back! So many things I want to try here."}
{"text":"This place is excellent!  Atmosphere is very cool, but here is low down on the food...  Zucchini & walnut bread - amazing. We wanted more but had to control ourselves.   I had a special salad with local fruits & cheese - very good. My husband had the beet salad - very good.   Beef tartare small plate - off the charts excellent.   Scallops with crab risotto & asparagus - excellent. Mac & cheese - luscious!  Even had a crumbly topping on it. Filet - has a lot of promise but was so salty!  That was disappointing since everything else was so great.   Get the donuts for dessert!  I promise you will clean the plate. Carrot cake was disappointing. It was a decent orange cake, but in my opinion they should not call it a carrot cake.   Our waiter James was excellent. Great description of foods and did a great job of checking in on us.   Definitely recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Been to meat and potatoes and loved it.... and this restaurant is just as amazing.....    atmosphere is a little cooler and more lively.....    I love the decorations ......    we started with a pig wig that had the best caramelization and tasted like upscale BBQ (I don't like sweet.... but this was a pleasant sweet).   For dinner I got skirt steak that was perfectly seasoned and had rice \"cakes\" (gnoccis)....    the sauce was the best and I loved my dish.....    my husband for the scallops and rissoto.... he said it had a great crab taste and he loved it.... we got drinks which was good hut a little to trying to hard to be foodie for me...   I recommend this anywhere.... like meat and poratoes it is foodie enough for those who want it and familiar enough for those afraid of foodie food.   Out service was fantastic and our server checked on is multiple times"}
{"text":"Went here for a work dinner. The service was terribly slow. Cocktails were average for it being such a hand spun drink bar. They were not very strong. The appetizers were indeed amazing. Should have left it there. Went with 6 people. 3 ordered steak medium. Was served rare and salty. I had the scallops. They were uneatable so salty! Food was cold as well. Small portions. High prices. Never again."}
{"text":"Seriously? Most definitely the worst restaurant in Pittsburgh I've been to so far in 2 years. Made my birthday meal the worst experience.   I have NEVER left a restaurant hungry before in my life. I was STARVING and had to go another restaurant right afterwards. My entree was $26 and included a strand of rabbit leg, 2 of the skinniest carrots I've ever seen and a scraping of what I supposed was mashed potato but only left the taste of mashed potato in my mouth. My husband's entree was $30 and he also managed to finish all my pancakes and his own pecan pie at Denny's afterwards.   My husband called a few days before to make reservations. For my birthday. On the night of. The person on the phone said I would get a dessert for free and a candle (okay, w/e about the candle). After we finished our paltry dishes in 3 minutes, the waitress informed us that we misheard and that Butcher and the Rye does not offer anything for free, even for birthdays. The candle is free but we would have to buy the dessert. Yeah, I'll skip s'mores for $10, thanks. I was in such a hungry and bad mood by then, that we hightailed it outta there and ate like real people at Denny's for my FREE birthday meal.   We were seated in this dingy, cramped, wobbly-tableled bistro set right at the stairs. Oh, and it took us 20 minutes to find parking and paid another $8 for 45 minutes. I also regretted that my hubs ordered a $12 stupid cocktail that was of course, half the glass. I just hated that we threw all this money at this place for something that I could have whipped up for a child. I think only a 5 yr old might have been partially full eating what we both ate. I'm so done with uppity downtown restaurants. I'm going to a place where there is parking, comfortable seats, enough lighting to see my food, free bread or something and most importantly, a full sized entree. Please be warned."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for a meal of the small plates. We enjoyed all things pork! The crispy pig wing, the pig candy, and the marrow really savory and delicious all around. We also shared the mac n' cheese, which was perfectly fine, but didn't blow either of our skirts up, and the Brussels sprouts--skirts blown!   The service was attentive, but not in your face. The atmosphere was cool, especially the music playlist the night we went, a lot of 90's kind of rock, which suits are age group to a tee.   Two things: whoa is it DARK upstairs! and Second, the ladies room, come on! Like there is NO privacy with that two-stall sitch, unless you lock the main door into the restroom."}
{"text":"Favorites were the Brussels and scallops! Awesome decor and service.   While the texture of the pasta was perfect in the Dirty Pasta, it was too cheesy for me.   I also tried the Pig Candy, an Americanized version of bossam, a Korean dish of braised pork belly served with pickled radish, hot chili paste,and kimchi. I prefer the original Korean dish. The Pig Candy was too sweet.    Overall, a wonderful anniversary dinner with the hubby. Our server brought out complimentary champagne for us!"}
{"text":"I had the crispy octopus, caesar salad and mussels. The food was excellent, the staff were obliging and tried their best to accommodate. The only problem is that on any night of the week, it will be so full that there's no place to eat unless you've made a reservation. Their system could be a little more organized. The bar is incredible, and the bartenders fully experienced. A wonderful place to dine, but having a reservation is recommended."}
{"text":"On a Tuesday I made reservations for Friday and the earliest available table was 10 pm so I snagged it. We were running behind because of the snow, and the hostess was understanding when I called. We were seated immediately in the second level. We ordered cocktails, I had some concoction of gin and cava, and my friend had a manhattan made with coconut bitters. We ordered a russet and sweet potato appetizer. The potatoes were roasted and covered in a creamy sauce and crisp chives. I ordered the Monk Fish for my meal, it came with blue crab risotto, chanterelle mushrooms, capers and kale chips. It was also gluten free. My friend ordered the beef stroganoff and he loved it. The server did let us know the portions were \"small plates\" and I thought the sizes were perfect. We skipped dessert and instead headed to the bar for an after dinner drink. Out server was attentive and quite knowledgable, she even had all of the specials memorized. The drinks, service, and food were all great!"}
{"text":"Bartenders attitudes are poor---arrogance beyond anything I have ever experienced. customer service much left to be desired.  Poor experience, the women have chips on their shoulders they should reevaluate their professions or tending bar"}
{"text":"My sister came in from New York to visit and was excited to tryt this place. The atmosphere is really cool and the food was delicious. I got the hanger steak and it was good. Despite the good atmosphere and great food we had a horrible waitress that was nothing but rude the whole time, she made us very uncomfortable the entire time, we did not enjoy our experience there at all due to her, name was Melanie."}
{"text":"AMAZING!  Make reservations to get a table.  The steak with the potatoes we're very tasty just need to eat them fairly quickly as it doesn't taste as good cold. The scallops were perfectly cooked. Overall the food was very delicious and the portions size looked small but was quite filling.  Great customer service and a friendly atmosphere. Heads up if you don't like to walk up and down stairs especially if you need to use the restroom request a table on the main floor."}
{"text":"Whoa, took us long enough to get here! I recommend making reservations as far in advance as you can for weekends if you want a decent shot at eating at normal dinner hour. Luckily I finally remember to do so! Our reservations were at 7, we got their early anticipating that we would have to grab a drink at the bar but they were ready for us (sweet)! Our server was barely polite, he never did tell us his name. Lucky for him we were just excited to be there. We got cocktail beverages out of their extensive list, which were both very good. As an appetizer we ordered a cheese plate and the runner did explain all the cheeses in it, yum! Now, the wait...  About 45 min to an hour later, with no acknowledgment that our food was on its way from our not so pleasant server we were very hungry. Where was our food? Just as we were able to ask, it came. I had the scallops and he had the hanger steak. We were both very satisfied with our meals. They were so delicious, thank goodness, after that wait! We opted out of dessert in fear we'd have to wait another hour. The decor and ambiance is very cool and interesting with its wild game. It's very intimate but is pretty dark! So make sure your phone is charged for the flash light. After all the hype the service was pretty disappointing. We were there for 2 hours! They could've have another couple in and out in that time. Now I know why there is such a long wait. BUT the food will definitely bring us back!"}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere were fabulous. I would say our waitress was a little lacking of emotion and the wait time was kind of crazy but it was a busy night. I would go again when I have a lot more money in my pocket because this place is PRICEY. I want to take all of the decor home with me"}
{"text":"We had 10PM reservations, and it was definitley necessary. We had the pig wing, tartare, and pork belly apps that were all delish. I also had the scallop dinner and my husband had the shepherd's pie, both of which were fantastic. Great vibe, decor, and music at this place. The staff were all quick, professional, and friendly. The bartender made us some very good classic cocktails."}
{"text":"Starting with the ambience and ease of making a reservation: they use Yelp for reservations! How easy is that? The vibe is hip and cool sans pretension. The music? 80's ...love it!  To drink we had a red ale and a white lightening ale: yummy and refreshing.   The appetizers we chose: Brussels and cauliflower were unique and delish! For our meals - based on Yelp - we chose scallops and the Dirty Pasta. Great portions, awesome flavor combinations and appealing plating.   Dessert was the flourless chocolate cake  which was scrumptious.   Our server was Ralph: efficient and made excellent recommendations.    Living 35 minutes from New York we have had great meals. However, Butcher and the Rye gives your the food, the vibe and great service.   We recommend using the valet: it is convenient and cheap compared to NY pricing ($12).   All total: our bill was $120 and we think well worth it."}
{"text":"Deducting 1 star for the unwelcoming, smug, standoffish 'greeting' i received this evening from the 2 men at the front. You work at a restaurant,  you're not sheiks,  get over yourselves. My server and the female bartender upstairs were much more welcoming.   Very trendy, intimate atmosphere upstairs - could do w/o the cold air blasting on my neck.  Smoke and mirrors cocktails - smoky and tasty  Mac and cheese - aaaaaaaauuughhhllll (Homer Simpson drool). A delicious, creamy blend of different cheeses . Soooo good.  Friendly locals and good drinks - I recommend. I also recommend the hosts downstairs to remove the stick from their ...well, you know."}
{"text":"The attention to detail here is insane...absolutely insane. Everything from the decor, to the food, to the cocktails, and dessert is a work of art. Every taste or sip is meticulously crafted to ensure your optimum enjoyment. In a town that is starting to get big into the food scene, Butcher and the Rye really has put itself above the rest.  We started with two cocktails: the Irishman and the punch. The beautiful wall of whiskeys was gorgeous, but since walking in and seeing the most Hipster guy in the world rigorously shaking cocktails, we opted for something with more flair than a plain shot. Both were fabulous and contained whiskey, but were easy to drink for light drinkers. Every detail was just so, from a latte-like appearance on the Irishman to a perfect pink hue to the punch.  The food was also out of the world. My date and I shared the pig candy, lemon cake, and ordered two Waygu flank steaks. The pig candy I honestly can hardly describe; it was a euphoric mix of salty, vinegary, sweet, and (of course) bacony. The steak was delicious, tender, cooked exactly to my liking, and lasted probably a whole ten minutes on our table. The dessert was literally like a painting with the meringue splattered across the plate like paint. It tasted even better than it looked and was really unique.  The service is great, as well. Our server was patient with providing us recommendations and answering all of our questions. The food and drinks were timely, and we left incredibly full and happy. We are from Cleveland, but would driving all the way here for any birthdays or special occasions; I really can't get the pig candy out of my mind."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh next to Wild Rosemary. I absolutely love everything that I have tried here: their burgers, mushroom soup, pasta, scallops, and the desserts. It is definitely difficult to get a reservation but definitely worth the wait. It is also a little more pricey but worth it as the food is wonderful and high quality. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Up until recently, I had only been to Butcher and the Rye twice for post-workday cocktails. I have tried a few of them, and they have all been interesting and well-crafted. I knew I needed to return here for dinner, and was very excited when I finally made plans to do so during restaurant week.  I'm usually all about the prix fixe restaurant week menus (since they are usually unique and only offered for a limited time), but the regular menu had so many appetizing options that we decided to go our own route.   We started with the focaccia. The bread was delicious and I'm not exaggerating when I say I could have probably eaten an entire loaf of it by myself. It was accompanied by three spreads: a white bean puree, olive tapenade, and whipped ricotta. All three were delicious, and the servings were generous with a good bread-to-spread ratio.  We followed this with the dry aged tartare. I loved that the tartare was served on very thin pieces of bread, garnished with capers, radish, black garlic aioli, greens, and of course an egg yolk. It was visually a very appealing dish, and the flavor did not disappoint. I will mirror what my dining partner Ashley L. said: this was the best tartare I've had so far by a long shot.  I enjoyed the seared scallops for my entree. They were served on a blue crab risotto with chanterelles (and yet more capers--I clearly love them). The scallops were packed with flavor and perfectly succulent. Risotto is often hit or miss but this was delicious and the perfect texture. The portion was a good size and again looked just as good as it tasted.  The service has been great here, both at the bar and this time while dining. Everyone has been friendly and informative. The space itself is fantastic... the restaurant is divided into small areas (and an upstairs balcony), and with the low lighting and rustic finishes, has a very intimate yet comfortable atmosphere. I love the mismatched furniture and unique decor. They really did a great job at making the place feel and look upscale without being stuffy.  I'm already looking forward to my next trip here as there are a number of other items on the menu that sounded fantastic!"}
{"text":"I have dined here a few times and have never been disappointed. The place has a cool vibe, the food is fantastic and unique, and I have had some of my favorite cocktails here. I prefer the couches upstairs for dining personally, but it's usually full. I guess it's easier to get in if you know one of the bartenders or servers working. Oh and ummm whiskey? Yup."}
{"text":"After reading all the Yelp reviews, I knew I wanted to try this place when we were in Pittsburgh for a friend's wedding.  We walked in and were told it would be an hour wait unless we wanted to sit right up front at one of the communal tables.  Because I'd heard so much about the place, I wanted to see what other options looked like...ambiance is a big deal!  So I asked if we could check out the bar and the host then said they might have space at the upstairs bar.  I was so glad he did.  We had fabulous bartenders!  The food was really good too although the brussel sprouts were a bit too drenched in oil for my liking.  The burger is huge and delicious and I had the gazpacho soup which was wonderful!  It came with a piece of thin toast with crab on it....yum!!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Pittsburgh spots!  There are three completely different levels - which means three great atmospheres for you.  There is the downstairs, feels like a very standard bar.  The middle floor is the \"typical restaurant\" /dining feel and the upstairs has a very cool, relaxed lounge vibe.   Drinks: If the third floor has space - go up there and ask for Cecil.  Not kidding.  He's a magician.  Everything on the menu is creative, but they can make you just about anything.  Food:  Get the Cauliflower, sprouts, mac and cheese, any of the fishes....really I havent had a bad meal there.  The hanger steak is great too (get it rare-medium).  This may be a little pricey for some people- but the food is so worth it."}
{"text":"This is a true gastropub. So many places call themselves a (British) gastropub and justify it by placing something slightly English on the menu - Shepherd's Pie. That's what I was expecting here. This place however took the \"high-end\" part of the gastropub definition to heart.   First off I was happy to see the kitchen was open to 12am. I ordered the Shepherd's Pie and was expecting the traditional ground beef and veg under a crusty layer of mashed potatoes. Instead! Instead I got what appeared to be liquid potatoes - the menu called it potato foam! Under and throughout that there were peas, carrots, and braised beef. It was delicious!! And slightly minty... I absolutely loved this dish and it's the most unique, most untraditional, Shepherd's Pie I have ever had ($20 and worth it).   They also put a spin on the typical Moscow Mule. They serve that, but also serve a Naut-Mule ($10). It's based with the traditional Tito's Vodka and ginger beer, but includes fresh Jalapeño! The kick was refreshing, but not overpowering.   The atmosphere is super cool as well. I loved the backlit bar with counter to ceiling shelves of bottles. They have a moving ladder like in an old fashioned library to slide along the rear bar to get bottles down. There's an upstairs dining area as well as a small section in the back which is decorated like a modern hunting lodge - there's a big antler chandelier and mounted moose/deer heads surrounding wooden white chairs and velvety wall paper.   So unique. So good! Parking garage right around the corner."}
{"text":"Worth going to, but not quite as good as its sister flagship restaurant, Meat & Potatoes.  The highlight here is their extensive whiskey collection. It definitely the most extensive in Pittsburgh as they have a whole wall spanning 2 floors of their whiskeys that you can skim through on their iPad menu.  The food is definitely solid, and the ambiance is great. I just personally prefer Tako and Meat & Potatoes more so for a bite."}
{"text":"My fiance and I came here for the first time on Restaurant week.  It was pretty crowded for a Wednesday night, which to me is a good and bad sign. Good bc it means people like the place and bad if there was a wait, which there was no wait but it could be bc we made reservations.  The strange part to me (which made me give a 4/5 stars) was when we were seated, the host ushered us to one of the long tables by the bar, which already had customers dining and the host wanted us to sit in between the other diners.  We didn't know that it was like that, and it would've been fine to dine with others except we really wanted to be able to talk to each other that night without having to scream or have less privacy.  We did decide we'll just dine by the stools across from the bar.  I think when making reservations, the host should ask if guests are comfortable sitting with others before seating them there bc after an hour or so of sitting on the bar stools, it was definitely uncomfortable.  They could've offered to seat us somewhere else being that we did make reservations and I saw there were empty tables.  That aside, I did like the decor and atmosphere.  The food is one of the best I've had in pittsburgh.  I travel a lot and have tried a lot of food in other major cities and this place is definitely one to brag for pitt!  For starters, I had the oxtail french onion soup, which I do recommend but there were parts that were tough to eat bc some of the toasted bread was burnt.  The fiance had a salad.  I forgot which one.  For pasta dish, I had the mac and cheese, which was so creamy and tasty. Fiance had the braised rabbit pappardelle.  It was yummy!  tasted like dark meat chicken.  We enjoyed the pasta dishes.  My fave was the entree.  I had the fish with the wasabi mashed.  The fish was perfectly cooked.  Seems to be seared on the outside but it's like butter.  Tasteful butter.  Haha.  Really thoughtful dish!  The flavors blended so well on this dish.  Eventhough the portion was small, I enjoyed every bite of it and it was just enough if you had the pasta dish.  Fiance had the roasted chicken with the mushrooms, creamed brussels and grapes, which was also a very good.  for dessert, I had the deep fried brownie which was a beer battered peanut butter brownie with peanut praline and bananas served with bittersweet chocolate.  I'm a chocoholic, so it was divine to me.  Fiance had the coconut cream cheese ice cream on carrot cake with candied pineapples, which again is so creative and delish!  If you love whiskey, you should try this place as they have different varieties of aged whiskey.  My fiance tried a flight but beware of the price.  I didn't know whiskey was that expensive.  It was $75 for 3 whiskey \"shots,\" which were 10, 12, 30 yr old whiskey, but he said he enjoyed it.  I think other flights were less than that.  tried a non-alcoholic drink, which wasn't that great to me for the price.  Overall, the food was definitely amazing at this place and would definitely recommend.  The chef should join food network's chopped bc the dishes he made were delicious and creative!"}
{"text":"I don't have a single complaint about this place -- our waitress Sara was so kind and even without a reservation our wait was very short. Their bartender knows what he's doing, they have a delicious Moscow Mule! We had a sampling of small plates. Don't underestimate the size though! We were stuffed to the brim!"}
{"text":"This meal was one of a kind! From the drinks to the entrees, everything was incredible. We were seated upstairs in a beautifully decorated area. We ordered three appetizers for the table to share. All of them were fantastic. We had the rustic sourdough bread that is served with a homemade butter and a delicious pan gravy that is absolutely delicious for dipping!! We also had the pig candy, which was a piece of perfectly cooked pork belly garnished with pickled veggies, radishes, and cilantro. Another favorite!! So much flavor and depth. But, I must saw my favorite appetizer was the brussel sprouts. They were cooked so well, with an extremely charred and crispy texture and were served with a lemon aioli which was incredible!! They are like no Brussel sprouts you've ever had before, and you may not try them that good again in your lifetime. AMAZING!! For dinner, I had the chicken, which was so tender and juicy, unlike most chicken at other restaurants. It was served on a bed of creamed brussel sprouts with sauteed mushrooms and roasted grapes, which added a lovely sweet flavor. Wonderful dish! The guests I dined with had the scallops, which were pan seared and served over a bed of blue crab risotto (so rich and perfect), with crispy kale and capers!! AWESOME! We also had the special, a smoked duck bolognese. A rich, fun rendition of a traditional bolognese with duck, and bursts of pomegranate seeds for awesome flavor. Along with our amazing cocktail, a nauti-mule (a regular moscow mule sciped up with jalapeno), it was a fantastic evening with great service and an awesome atmosphere!!! Definitely would go again, and bring friends as well! Great job!"}
{"text":"All the reviews about this place are accurate. This is the best place to eat in the entire city."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night. I am giving this place 5 stars for food and 3 stars for service.  In terms of food and drinks, we ordered the Mac and cheese for appetizer, the trout and chicken for main course, and the chocolate cake for dessert. Everything was delicious and the flavors were just right. I would recommend everything we ordered and would order it again. The drinks were also very good, their cocktail list is very extensive.  In terms of service, this needs some improvement. We had reservations at 7:30 but we were not seated until 7:40. We didn't get our drinks together, I got mine first and then my husband got his at a later time point. We got the wrong order for our main course, but were compensated at the end for this which we appreciated. For our bill, they had charged us for an extra entree that we had to ask to be taken off before we paid.  Overall, I would come back to this restaurant because the food was top notch and there is a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"The cocktails at Butcher and the Rye are five stars for sure. Great place to grab some drinks after work! I tried the B3 Fizz, a strong but balanced gin and beet juice concoction. I also tried the punch of the day - I don't remember what was in it, but it was really good. It had spices like cinnamon and just the right sweetness. I've been here before, also for cocktails only, and everything we tried was good.  As for food, I haven't had a chance to sit down for a proper meal. I did try the gnocchi which was a daily special. It wasn't too memorable, so I'd like to come back and try the regular menu, hence the four stars for now. Service at the bar counter was good - waters were kept full and the bartender checked in on how the drinks were."}
{"text":"I'll be Captain Obvious by stating that this is not the best place for a vegetarian (shocking, I know). I've been to similar restaurants with fantastic veggie options so I was optimistic. That faded quickly. The food, overall, was very underwhelming. The only vegetarian options were on the small plates menu. The brussels (vegetarian without the parmesan) were flavorful but completely drenched in oil. The cauliflower was slightly better but had an overbearing taste of lime. I would not recommend either. However, the night was saved by the amazing chocolate banana cake.  Since it's usually busy in the evenings, service was very slow - both the wait staff and the kitchen. We had a reservation for 7:30pm but was not actually seated until closer to 8pm. It then took another hour for us to get our food."}
{"text":"This was my first time here . Ate at the bar . Because the place was busy, it's worth the wait , however I suggest you call for a reservation . The staff is friendly enough, but it's a little loud in here.. I will definitely come back and eat at the table ."}
{"text":"In town on business and walked by Butcher and the Rye on my way to Market Square. Talked my coworkers into coming back and having dinner. Best choice ever! From the Brussels to pig candy to the scallops.. Everything was so good! Best meal I've had in a long time. Definitely worth the stop!"}
{"text":"Food was quite good (Brussels, delicious little salty, dirty pasta - great, scallops - great) and I was pleased they let us in at dinner time without a reservation but the service annoyed me! The waitress wasn't that friendly and rushed us the entire time (even after I told her she was too fast), constantly coming back and asking for the next thing we wanted / dessert/check etc. Sometimes I do want to be in and out quickly but catching up with my girlfriend felt really rushed and I ended up not enjoying it as much as I thought I would. I'd give the food 4 stars but the waitress fewer so my review comes down to a 3."}
{"text":"I love the Manhattans. Potato leek soup is out of this world."}
{"text":"This was really quite phenomenal. I went by myself while visiting on business and sat at the bar. The mushroom soup was tasty but the scallops were simply orgasmic (can I say that on yelp?)  The value is decent too at $10/cocktail and $20-$30 per entrée.  Bartender's whimsy for a flip-like cocktail was also a hit. All in all, I would definitely return here, even if I had to pay my own dime next time ;)  Update: I returned the next night with a coworker and it was even better. The bartender, Ryan (I think that was his name... I delayed too long in updating the review!) made some more excellent cocktails and we had some more excellent food."}
{"text":"Wanted to update after we had a fabulous time here last night!  Went here after seeing a Gentleman's Guide to Love and Murder at the Benedum right around 10:15. I felt bad going to a restaurant so close to their closing time, but we didn't really feel like fast food and we love Butcher's offerings.   Our server Sara(h,?) was great! She never made us feel like we were infringing on her getting ready to go home and was really engaging and able to take the time to talk to us about our favorite dishes and even about some different apple pie recipes which was so fun!   We had the pig candy which is always delicious and luckily my husband only wanted a little bit so I got a great big portion! I ordered the chicken as I always do and my husband ordered one of the daily specials which was a duck and foie gras tortellini. I wish I could have tried this dish(but can't right now due to the little one), but the small looking portion was very rich and heavy and according to my husband absolutely delicious. The chicken was absolute perfection as always and I am convinced the best chicken dish in all of Pittsburgh.   Sara was nice enough to let us know when there was about 10 minutes left before the kitchen was closing and tempted us with dessert. We ended up with the salted caramel apple pie and cream cheese ice cream which absolutely blew everything else that we ate out of the water! I can't explain to you how good this dish was other than to say that as someone who constantly is working to perfect her own apple pie recipe that I am not sure mine could ever come close to the perfection that was this pie. It was absolutely delicious.   As always, I will be back!"}
{"text":"I've been putting this one off for a while. It's hard because I love Meat and Potatoes, their \"sister\" restaurant. And while they are very similar in terms of food, I just don't think they're quite there yet.  I've had the trout, which was good, but still not on par with M n' P. I've also dived into their breads, which are very good. But I feel like I'm still looking for something to set them apart. I know it will happen... or hope at least!  But the drinks... Oh the drinks! They are spectacular! I mean, I want to drink there every night. Which would probably mean I have a problem... but it's just so good. I'm so into the Boulavardier. I can't help but get that every time I'm there. I know I need to branch out though, I realize I'm tying myself down. But sometimes I can't help myself!  The attention to detail in decor is incredible. It makes me feel like I'm in a secluded writer's cabin, if you ignore all the people eating and drinking inside. I love the squirrels on the wall and the little corner with the desk and typewriter. Every time I'm there I find some other little bobble or decoration to admire.  The one negative is the bathroom. As everyone else has noted, it is... interesting. I get it. It's supposed to be like stalls in a barn. I know, you can lock the door so that no one can get in, even though there's two stalls. But you don't learn that you can lock the door until you've been in there a handful of times. If you're the lucky one who doesn't know, you're sure to get a peak at something you might not want to see or someone will get a looksie at your goodies. Just bein' honest folks.   Maybe that's why you need to just have bother drink there??"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I went here for the first time last night. Our reservations were for 10:15, and they took us to our table right on time. We both enjoyed the drink specials for the night, they had a pink (alcoholic) punch for $8. We ordered macaroni and cheese for out appetizer-- TO DIE FOR! Highly recommend the Mac and cheese. You can also order sourdough for $5, though I wasn't much a fan of the bread. The main courses were tasty and well prepared. The service was quick and the atmosphere was cool and fun. This definitely seemed like a place for young professionals and hipsters with rich parents. Overall, I would go back. However, the food is on the border of what I would consider overpriced. Very hip place, with prices to match."}
{"text":"Great bourbon selection and the food is pretty consistently good...only drawback is the waits tend to be longer than other restaurants around it."}
{"text":"Butcher and the Rye was probably one of the top 10 meals I've ever had. We ordered the foccacia plate, two small plates (the pig candy and the pei mussels) and two large plates (the braised rabbit pappardelle and the seared scallops). The prices weren't as expensive as we had intended, and the portions were perfect. There were a lot of mussels in the plate, so it could have been considered a large plate i think. Everything was amazing and timed perfectly, as they brought out each plate after another, rather than all at once. The beer choice was awesome (as well as the whiskey choice, though we didn't get any). Our waitress Melissa was awesome. Not only is the food great, but the atmosphere is too. We will definitely be back! I wasn't sure what to expect as my boyfriend surprised me by taking me there for our anniversary, but we both left full and very happy. Keep up the good work! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Dear Butcher and the Rye,  Your women's bathroom is the most ridiculous bathroom I have ever seen, and offends my female dignity.  For reals.  As you know, this bathroom was obviously designed by a male, Hipster architect (no woman would ever be so bone-headed), and the issue is that the two tiny stall doors and walls are waist-high. The upshot is that every time you walk into the restroom, you get to stare directly into the desperate, trapped eyes of ladies in the two stalls at the very moment that they are relieving their bladders and/or bowels. If you get close enough (which you pretty much have to, because it's a tiny space), you can also see their hiked up skirts and all their ladybits.  Awwwwkward!!    As if all of that weren't excitement enough, the ladies' room is directly adjacent to the men's restroom. Which means you may also get the unique humiliation of having your date or your Dad as he's passing by the door witness your pride washing away with each flush of the toilet bowl.    The conversations I have had in this restroom attest to the intense discomfort: One diner: \"What if I had to change a tampon?  This is awful.\"  Another diner: \"Ladies, can you please turn your backs and also block the door? I'm really uncomfortable right now.\"  I can now confidently say that people don't want to feel like farm animals in pens when they are patrons of one of the best restaurants in town.  This is taking the butcher concept to a not-fun extreme.     There's no point in waxing poetic about how your harissa cauliflower was Foodgasmic, how the Witch Doctor cocktail was perfectly crafted, or how the tables under the antler chandelier are charming.  Why?  Because of your G. D. ladies' bathroom.  I kindly request that you take some of your piles of profit and install regular-height bathroom doors.    The ladies of Pittsburgh and I thank you for your time,  A Diner Who Really, Really Has to Pee"}
{"text":"Been here 4 times in 2015 and everything has been fantastic.  The dishes are complex in flavor but not fussy in appearance.  I especially love the small plates for a late-night bite.  The Brussels are one of the finest small plates I've had anywhere mainly due to the perfect char and use of preserved lemon which sets it apart.  Pig Candy is also a winner.  I love the short ribs as a large plate and don't sleep on the Shepherd's Pie.    It would be great if they made more of the Butcher Burgers though - they are always out of them when I get there, which means they must be epic.   Very dark inside with a cool somewhat kitschy ambiance.  Retro almost steampunk in my eyes, but what do I know!   A great place for drinks - especially for a bourbon guy like me.    The staff is good, not superlative, but their friendliness and enthusiasm for service make up for any errors- which are few.    The only complaints I have seen are about price, portion and staff.  As far as price goes, it is commensurate to the quality of the product; therefore, fair in my estimation.  Join the Elks Club if you want cheep booze.  Eat at Old Country Buffet if you want obscene portions, and as far as staff goes, most complaints I've seen are from people who take issue with the hipster vibe of many on the staff which is not fair.  Beards on the young men and tattoos on the young ladies don't bother me."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere, engaging and friendly staff, and incredible and Interesting food! Here for a visit in Pittsburgh for work and yelp recommended this place and I couldn't be more pleased. I definitely think I will make a return visit if I am in the area. Check it out!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE. I came here for drinks and couldn't wait to come back for dinner. Last week I came back and it lived up to my high expectations. Even the bread is worth writing about. You get 3 spreads, including a citrus marmalade, an apple jam, and a honey butter. All were absolutely delicious and a great way to start the meal. We also tried the mac n cheese, brussel sprouts, and flank steak. I am a huge mac n cheese fan, and this mac n cheese was pretty good. The brussel sprouts really surprised me. They were served with chopped ham and onions, which really complimented the flavor. And my absolute favorite - the flank steak! It was served with fingerling potatoes and a delicious aioli that I really couldn't get enough of.  Service was okay, and it was very cold upstairs, but the venue itself is a much needed addition to Pittsburgh. The whiskey selection is incredible (I think the best in town?) and the bartenders are well trained. I might just have to start leaving work earlier to make it here for a post-work drink - I feel like it would draw a great crowd."}
{"text":"I went to explore their whiskey selection, I was not disappointed. Jenna and Corey helped me work through the menu and narrow down my choices. They didn't steer me wrong! Do yourself a favor and check this place out! Corey and Jenna were great. I also witnessed Michael at work and he was awesome. Hit them up!!!"}
{"text":"Great bourbon selection, but horrible bartenders.  It may have been the 2 we dealt with, but they knew NOTHING about what they were pouring.  Not only was their knowledge lacking, but their order taking skills were poor.  My wife and I each ordered a different bourbon, 1 oz pour, neat.  Doesn't get much simpler than that.  Our bartender grabbed one bottle so we had to tell him we both weren't getting the same thing.  After he grabbed the correct bottles, he gave us 2 oz pours.  With a little common sense and a lot of education, this place could be great.  We didn't eat anything, but everything looked delicious."}
{"text":"Butcher and the Rye has built up fo level of loyal fanaticism normally only reserved for religious leaders and heads of state.  As it's dining devotees continued to multiply, I decided it was time to investigate for myself.  The rumors are true.  When you sip your expertly prepared craft cocktail or lift your fork to your dish, a beam of light shines down from above, a choir of angels serenade you, and your tongue breakdances in your mouth.  As truly exceptional as the food and drinks are (The bruschetta was phenomenal, and I would sell my soul to learn their Brussel Sprout appetizer recipe) the atmosphere is what is most distinctive about B&R.    I love their sister restaurant Meat & Potatoes, which is also excellent, but the decorations and vibe are on a whole other level.  Imagine if Clint Eastwood was playing a lawyer cowboy industrialist tycoon in the late 1800s, and you'd been invited to a VIP party in his mansion.  Vintage wallpaper, playful taxidermy, books, plush vintage couches, top hats, distressed wood, and antique lighting, are expertly placed to cover every square inch of B&R with class and character.    It's not a cheap, but the food, atmospehere, and fast, friendly, knowledgable staff live up to their sky high reputation.  Butcher and the Rye may be the coolest and most unique gastropub in the burgh.  I can't wait to introduce more friends to it, if only so I have an excuse to go back!"}
{"text":"We were in Pittsburgh for a weekend and of course we could not get a reservation on short notice.  Luckily the two of us were able to get seats at the bar on a very busy Saturday evening.  A friend had recommended BatR and after reading other reviews we wanted to give it a try  The atmosphere is as described in the other reviews.  A young, loud and energetic crowd is apparently here every night.  The impressive wall of over 350 bottles of whisky is almost a little intimidating when deciding on a drink.  Before taking our drink orders the bartenders brought glasses of water.  A nice extra for a bar specializing in traditional cocktails.  I started with their oak barrel aged Manhattan, recommended by the bartender.  He stated it is one of their most popular cocktails.  The drink was a great start to the evening.  I can understand its popularity.  From now on, I will judge all other Manhattans against this one.  Two of us ordered two small plates and one large plate. The food was enough for me (a larger appetite) and her (a smaller appetite).  Everybody was talking about the fried Brussels sprouts so we tried them.  They were wonderful, fried to a medium brown with shaved cheese and just enough seasoning to make them savory.  The only downside to the dish was a tad too much oil (grease) in the bottom of the bowl.  The Pig Candy must have taken hours to prepare.  Pork belly was slow cooked, tender and flavorful with a semi-sweet glaze, served over spicy apples prepared with a Korean inspired kimchi sauce.  The semi-sweet pork and spicy apple was a surprising combination.  I actually enjoyed the spicy apple more than the pork belly.  Definitely not your traditional pork chops and apple sauce.  She wanted the monkfish served over blue crab risotto.  Chanterelle mushrooms, capers and fried kale chips rounded out this dish.  Each bite had a different flavor combination as we mixed and matched the different elements on the plate.  She thought the risotto could have had more crab flavor but I had no complaints.  I thought the risotto was creamy and balanced.  My second cocktail of the evening was the Sazerac.  When the bartender brought it over I was unimpressed.  Served neat in a highball glass, it looked like I was short-poured.  But then I tasted it.  Wow!  The flavors exploded.    Her cocktail was a creation of the bartender not on the menu.  A citrus blend with Prosecco garnished with a lemon twist.  She thought it was just OK.  I tried a sip and thought it was quite good - like a lemon-lime soda for adults.  Even though the joint was packed, the trio of bartenders managed to keep up with the crowd.  They were very helpful and made excellent recommendations without over-selling.  Some of the earlier reviews gave negative marks for service, but we had no complaints.    If you go, get a reservation or hope to get lucky for open bar seats.  BatR does not open until 5 most nights so get there early if you do not have a reservation.  For the price, I was expecting a lot and I was not disappointed."}
{"text":"With a toilet like this and a water pipette for tasting I just knew this place would live up to the hype. I was right!  I watched one bar tender shaking a drink in the left hand while stirring another with his right hand while carrying on a conversation. I was so impress I tried the 'tap my head and rub my belly at the same time' trick and laughed loudly enough people looked over at me. As you read this keep in mind that I went for the booze more than the food.  A MEGA WALL of booze with knowledgeable staff to boot. Ask for a whisky list and you get an iPad with brown juice categorized by type, location time period, etc. What fun! 1oz and 2oz pours from $4-$800(for those big spenders) of juice from all over the world. By the time I was done I was feeling out of this world having spent way more on liquid than solid consumption.   Oh yeah, the food. I went with my Yelper recommendations and got the Sunday Gravy and Scallops which were both good. They weren't crazy good. Hence the 4 and not 5-stars.  Elbow bent and two forks up. YUM!"}
{"text":"Came in and sat at the bar. The bartender was very knowledgeable and nice. The bar is just a really cool place to hang out. Ordered the mac and cheese and i was not let down. The noodles were cooked perfectly and the bread crumbs on top were a nice touch. Super creamy and cheesy I would deffinatly recomend it. Staff, food, and ambiance were spot on!!!"}
{"text":"This place has a great vibe and food to go with it. And if you like bourbon you HAVE to go here as they have 400 different to choose from. Be prepared for a wait though as this place is hopping."}
{"text":"My main issue with this place is inconsistency in service. That overrides the food for me. Reservations? Well you better hope you get what u requested! Specified table and chairs downstairs. We were plopped upstairs in the dark and 2 of us had to sit on foot stools. The other three sat on a couch. In the dark. Our server was the bartender for the upstairs bar. Needless to say he was very busy and made it to our \"table\" only twice. Altogether disappointed for a grand total of $350.  Another night friends from out of town wanted to go there to try some of the whiskeys. Ok. Sounded great, until we decided to eat. Nope. No tables. Only serving apps at the bar, not al, of us had bar stools and had to stand for over an hour. Just uncomfortable and chaotic.  But we have gone there and had delicious food! Brussels sprouts? Who knew they could taste that good?! Be warned though, there were no main dishes that are offered that were vegan. All have meat and cheeses. The seasonal salads I've had were good.  I will not return and drop hundreds $$$$ for spotty and chaotic service and a limited menu.  But the bourbon is great!"}
{"text":"I was visiting Pittsburgh with my boyfriend last week. We went to dinner with his friends at this place. One friend said this was one of her favorite places. When we got our cocktail, I could tell why. The cocktail was delicious. Then we got sourdough as an appetizer. Yum! Finally, I ordered a burger for my entree...ew. I have never had a more tasteless burger in my life. I enjoyed the fries 1000x more than the burger. I loved everything else at this restaurant, but DO NOT get a burger. It was like eating paper."}
{"text":"We love Butcher, and are never disappointed with the food, drinks or service! Our waitress Wendy was wonderful and knowledgeable! The burrata appetizer was fantastic - definitely give it a try!"}
{"text":"Wow!  From the valet to the, host, to the bartenders, to the servers - the service was excellent!  Everyone was so pleasant and accommodating - especially for a very busy Saturday night.  The decor - jaw dropping.  We sat at the upstairs bar and it was like attending a show!  Each of us had wonderfully crafted whiskey cocktails.  Food was fantastic...we only had appetizers, but I will dream about the Brussels sprouts for all eternity.  I can't wait to go back!  Side note - we ordered food for a friend to go from Tako next door.  Also fantastic with wonderful service."}
{"text":"The husband and I went here for his birthday celebration tonight. They open at 5 and we had a reservation for 5 as well. We were both a big fan of the decor and it was a really cool environment. Being the first people in I was hoping to get a better seat but it wasn't overly concerned about it. We got in and seated right on time and ordered some drinks. He had the Wild Kind and I indulged in the Jack Rose... both were great! For an appetizer we went with the brussel sprouts, oh my lanta, they were delicious! I can't say enough good things about them, you get a big portion and from the smell of them to the taste, they were amazing! The main course I went with the Butcher Burger and it was probably the best burger I've ever had. It was cooked perfectly and was absolutely delicious. Hubby had the braised rabbit and dumplings, and while i couldn't bring myself to try it, he loved it! We were very interested in trying the ginger bread dessert but we're so full that we couldn't do it, next time! The only negatives I can think of is that the tables upstairs are sooo close together and considering we were the very first people in the restaurant our food took a loooong time. The table next to us was finished eating before we got our meals and a few other tables were half way done. We were told that the kitchen got backed up but it was worth the wait! We will be back."}
{"text":"I've only been here once and was immediately captivated by the great wall of whiskey, bourbon and the likes. The atmosphere is fantastic here - almost makes you forget you're in Pittsburgh and not in some ritzy, hip town like New York City.  My boyfriend and I were sat upstairs at a small table by the bar - which gave us a perfect view of the \"great wall of whiskey\". What was great was that we could still talk and hear each other although the place was quite crowded. When we sat down we were warmly greeted by our cheery waitress and even had the pleasure of talking to the manger, Michael Mills. He was extremely nice to talk to and you could tell he loved his job - which in the restaurant industry, that is sometimes hard to come by and we appreciated the attentiveness.   We got two small plates - the Brussells and the Pig Candy - OMG. Amazing! We had recently went to Tom Colicchio's steakhouse in Las Vegas and got the brussel sprout appetizer and let me tell you, this restaurant was quite comparable! Both of these small plates were out of this world.  For dinner we got the Wagyu Flank Steak and the Seared Scallops. Both were delicious, but not quite as delicious as the small plates we had just eaten.   On the drinks side we both had 2 drinks and left there feeling quite good. The drinks were different than anything I had tasted. I got the Bees Knees (because sadly I am not a whiskey, bourbon, scotch drinker) and it was amazing."}
{"text":"Excellent drinks, service, food, and atmosphere.  You will not be disappointed. We had the old fashioned and whiskey sour to drink. Appetizer was sourdough bread with pan drip gravy.  Seasonal salad was out of this world with flavor. And main course pasta dishes will have me coming back for more. The dirty pasta specifically....I would request on my death bed. It is that good!! 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"First off I want to say that the quality of food here versus Los Angeles where I reside is night and day. Looking at reviews on Yelp always gives me a good idea of how good or bad a restaurant is. Unfortunately I do understand that food in bigger cities are going to naturally be a lot better than others, that being said.. when I came across 4.5 stars for Butcher and Rye I almost certainly thought this place was decently good. First off I will say the service was good but the good ends there! We came with a party of 8 and we ordered 8 different plates so I can honestly say we tried a vast majority of almost everything they had on the menu. Every single meal had an abundant amount of salt and the Dirty Pasta was the worst out of all in terms of too much salt. Instead of getting into each dish I have to say.. this night was a bad one for YOUR restaurant! Food was subpar at best and I can't see 4.5 stars being he threshold here.. not even close!"}
{"text":"I really, really wanted to like this place. This was my first time visiting Pittsburgh and I'd read up on all the places that are a \"must-try\". 4.5 stars on Yelp. Rave reviews. Even an off-day here should be amazing. Right?   When we walked in it looked very promising. The maître d looked, fittingly, pompous yet disinterested- tasked with being the gatekeeper of the culinary experience that must await while also being cool enough to not take it all too seriously. The ambiance and the vibe inside was very young and hip, the decor- a bit dark but an impressive array of butcher themed artwork, meat cleavers and mounted animal heads, all apt design choices.   The menu options were almost all things that couldn't help but sound delicious. Fried Brussels sprouts under a mountain of Parmesan? Ummm, yes please. Pork candy? Not sure what that is, but we'll take 2 because how could you not? Tartare with parmesan crusted something and truffle something something? You had me at truffle something. Roasted bone marrow? Bring it on. And those were just our appetizers. For our entree a rack of lamb on a bed of pillowy polenta. Of course this was going to be nothing short of amazing.    Our plates came out looking as you'd expect. Sauces and creams artfully smeared. Parmesan cheese masterfully shaved. Microgreens and garnishes painstakingly placed. And it all tasted... just okay. Dish after dish, all with so much promise, all either a bit under-seasoned, a bit unimaginative or a bit basic- but all underwhelming, and all a little overpriced.   Maybe this was just an off night? Or maybe this is rated on a scale relative to the rest of Pittsburgh's food scene (which I'd heard good things about). But after going back and reading some of the not-so-gushing reviews, it seems there are others who have had an experience similar to ours. So I'm left wondering what all the hype is about."}
{"text":"Ok. I admittedly go the bathroom here a whole lot more often than I actually consume a full meal.   Perhaps I should write my entire entry about timely strategies using the restroom; or scoring the ability to sit with a drink while waiting for your party's reservation at Butcher & The Rye and/or tako on a regular basis. I'm pretty sure that's my real expertise. And that is kind of sad now that I write it. But the food at taco & BATR is amazing most of the time. So I'm willing to continue on in the dysfunctional relationship I tolerate with these establishments. Which is how I end up using the bathroom at BATR more often than I eat there. (When dining at taco, there is one stall for the entire place, INSANE, I head over here to use the ladies room. Same with scoring a seat at the bar before getting a table at tako. We tend to stop here first)   Strange, I have never been to tako or BATR and done the following- have a drink at the bar, consumer my meal, and used the restroom without walking between the two establishments.   I love both restaurants but I also like being able to use a restroom without standing in a line that's creating a human traffic jam. (tako is just poorly designed. it's like a real mexican experience in that you might feel desperate enough to use an alley as a toilet with their restroom line) I also like to sit while waiting. Back and forth. Back and forth.   Despite less than ideal restrooms, & bars that are just slammed beyond capacity; the space is very pleasant in Butcher And The Rye if you're seated at a table. If you arrive and find you are being given some awkward seating situation that really isn't the table type that you reserved, I'd skip the dining experience and return for a different evening. Food is excellent. Service and seating can be weird if its too busy and it seems that overbooking is the norm.   BUT THE FOOD IS EXCELLENT. That keeps us coming back. Just not with kids. I'm sure someone has brought kids. Sometimes it's a bit chaotic in feeling while there. It's almost too annoying at times for me, and I'm an adult. Its come to the point where I avoid making reservations of the weekend. Too many people clamoring for a last minute spot or trying to steal a spot at the bar. Go on a week night so you can enjoy your meal, savor every bite, let each drop of your drink linger. And not feel that buzz of others anxiety to get a spot or use the toilet.  Now the good stuff-  I don't drink whiskey BUT I've dined with others who get almost giddy at the whiskey selections offered. Also, I don't consume pork, red meat, or duck. (Gallbladder issues)  And have an aversion towards mushrooms, scallops, mussels, and rabbit. And an allergy to peaches, strawberries, cherries, and apples. So, one might wonder, What do I eat while everyone else is happily munching away at my table? Tomato Gazpacho, Beet Salad, Brussels, Mac N Cheese, or Cauliflower, Pasta modified, or chicken, - it's easy to not get bored.   My favorite meal by far is the Mac N Cheese, with a beet salad, and cheese board to share. And maybe brussels if I'm feeling generous and am willing to take a doggie bag home. Yes, a bit heavy on so many forms of cheese but it's a dream. Fontana, cheddar, goat, parmesean, oh my!  Oh, and the beet salad! That beet salad has just the perfect amount of crunch due to the greens and croutons layered with a pickled fennel zing and the perfect amount of zest in the orange dressing. The salad also had pepitas and goat cheese mixed in to create an amazing party in your mouth. Sweet, salty, pickled, crunchy. Paired with a glass of wine- heaven. Refreshing. And the brussel sprouts are unnecessary but they taste so good. Who knew sprouts could be delicious?! These are so amazing with their brown butter and cheese that my dogs will even eat them when brought home in their doggie bag! Yes, you read that. Brussel sprouts so amazing my dog will eat them leftover!   Admittedly my mini dachshund mix has a weight issue, she does get a lot of dining out leftovers but no matter what she usually won't touch vegetables. A lot of effort is put into her eating around the vegetable that come home in her doggie bags from other restaurants. The cauliflower, brussel sprouts, and salad bits are even consumed when brought home from Butcher And the Rye. Although my husband and father have proven they really love our smaller yet fattest dog, they order the Marrow just to have the leftovers to take home for her or her fat counterpart who lives with my parents. The dachshund duo practically loose their minds when the Marrow leftovers come home.   So whether you end up having an entire meal at a real table, or stop to use the restroom and go because the place to is too chaotic and overbooked to dine; I hope you too can appreciate the ambiance and cute decor. And when it isn't complete chaos do make a reservation to enjoy a meal."}
{"text":"The reviews don't lie, this place is pretty great.  We went here at prime time (7:30 pm) on a Saturday night and I was a little apprehensive that, despite our reservation, we might not be seated promptly.  I was wrong!  We were quickly escorted to the 3rd floor and a neat little table next to the railing, which gave us a perfect view of the establishment and a great way to check out the impressive whiskey wall.  I believe another reviewer labeled the decor as \"hunting lodge chic\".  Spot on!  There were interesting little trinkets and artifacts tucked in every nook and cranny.  My favorite was the outlandish taxidermy on the 3rd floor.  In particular, at the end of the bar on the 3rd floor there's a mounted rabbit with a squirrel riding it like a bucking bronco.  Fantastic!  I can't comment on the mixed drinks because I stuck with beer, but the beer selection was adequate.  This is a cocktail and whiskey place, so my expectations were met with the beer list.  Adequate but not impressive.  We tried the brussel sprouts, foccacia, and pig candy to start.  Brussel sprouts - ridiculous.  So good.  Chessy, buttery, is that a little lemon I taste on there?  Man, these were incredible!  And the \"small plate\" of brussel sprouts is A LOT of sprouts.  Easily enough for 4 people to get a decent serving.  Focaccia - meh. standard.  The whipped riccotta and parm spread was excellent!  Neither of us like olives, so the tapenade was lost on us.  The white bean dip was lacking.  It tasted like plain, pureed white beans.  This one needs some work.  Pig Candy - it was good, but I've had better at several other places.  Perhaps my least favorite part of it was that it was served as a 4 oz. hunk of fat that was not cut up in any way, shape or form.  I think the presentation needs a little work here.  Who doesn't like pork belly, though?  For the latter part of the meal and after being reasonably full from two small plates and bread, we decided to take advantage of the Pittsburgh Restaurant Week 4-course tasting menu.  I don't recall what each item was, but can say that the standout was the skirt steak with chimichurri.  The rest was good, but not super memorable.  We both enjoyed this place a lot and would go back.  Next time we'd tackle small plates only, since this seemed to be the real sweet spot.  Butcher hasn't been open too long, and it seems they are still trying to find their place, or should I say, find their \"plate\".  They have a few standouts, but need to continue to  build their arsenal of awesome dishes.   Keep it up, guys!"}
