{"text":"I visited on a Sunday afternoon and was excited just from their punny name alone. It was also a bao time (sorry not sorry) something came to replace use-to-be Go For Tea location.   To start, it was very quiet with only another 4 guests sitting down. Maybe it was an odd time (3pm), or maybe most people ordered take out. The service was average, nothing spectacular.   I ordered a Korean Beef Bulgogi steamed bao, as well as a Pork Belly steamed bao. Sadly I was disappointed with both of them - the Korean Beef Bulgogi had some flavours but lacked harmony. To be fair, it may just be a personal preference to keep kimchi (spicy sour) separate from bulgogi sauce (sweet). The Pork Belly lacked any sort of taste. Quite literally, it was made with a slice of pork belly and cold lettuce. While there was Hoisin mayo, I could barely taste anything.   While I'm giving them two stars (one for idea and one for cleanliness), I don't think this was worth the price/effort. However, I do believe that the restaurant can easily improve their recipes by experimenting and perhaps reading the reviews they've been receiving thus far.  I will consider coming back if they improve."}
{"text":"My first time here it was great had the Jerk Chicken banh mi that was very delicious also had the Kim Chi fries they were not so bad I wasn't a big fan of the pork belly tacos they were what I had expected. I would definitely come back here"}
{"text":"I usually don't go near wraps and food of the sort, but the 'bao's here are SO good!!! The style of meats is similar to Japanese cuisine, the flavour is strong, and one bao will fill you up. Will be visiting again. The only downside is that they will not make a custom bao if you don't want certain ingredients."}
{"text":"At first I was hesitating to come based on the mediocre revies but since we were in the area and hungry, we thought we should give it a try.  To be honest, it was better than expected. We ordered the fish taco, jerk chicken banhmi, pork belly bao and fries. My favourite was definitely the fish taco. The jerk chicken was really good but I think because we ordered the banh mi, I personally like it more on baos. The pork belly bao was better than I expected too and it actually looked better than the other pictures posted. Guessing they are actually making changes based on people's review. The fries were really good as well.  Overall, it was good, food quality was at least good when we went so would definitely come back to try other things."}
{"text":"We were hesitant to try this place given all the mediocre reviews but it was better than expected.   We ordered the pork belly bao (which was good), korean beef bulgogi banh mi (the toppings were good but the bun was not fresh and a bit soggy). We also ordered the bulgogi Kim chi fries which were good except the bulgogi was in big pieces and should have been cut up. Also it was short on spicy mayo.  Overall we would come back. Pricing was more than banh mi boys and quality isn't as good but for uptown it's acceptable."}
{"text":"The food here is great but the service has gone down hill. Like one of the other commentators here, no music, lack of staff to service and clean the seating area and last week the same disgusting hoarked up spit and food bits can still be found in the washroom sink.  Umm maybe it's time to clean up that bathroom.  Finally, I ordered 2 baos and the bulgoki fries a half hour ago and still waiting for my food.  With only 3 people in the kitchen and 14-16 customers waiting, that's not acceptable."}
{"text":"They ran out of beef..... I came here to specifically try the bulgogi kimchi fries...and they ran out of....beef...."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here while waiting for our Congee Queen order and couldn't resist ordering one of their delicious looking baos. It was amazing and we haven't stopped telling people about how delicious It's a Bao Time was."}
{"text":"Went with a number of colleagues from work on a Friday afternoon. Was surprised when we showed up and it was empty inside, was hoping that it wasn't a sign of things to come.  I tried three of the bao's and was very impressed.  I'm told some of my friends went back for the banh mi and felt it left a bit to be desired, they decided to get the tacos instead and loved it.  I've only ever had Mean Bao by the AGO and although I will go back, and loved the food, I do think it was a wee bit overpriced."}
{"text":"I love the concept of varieties of Bao....but I gotta say, they offer small Bao for not so cheap price and the taste is just so so.   Fish Bao - a fried piece of fish fillet, nothing surprising. Pork Belly Bao - had a high expectation for this one, but it failed. The pork belly was dried and small.  If I were to pick one item that I liked the most it would be the kimchi fries."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday afternoon for lunch. Aside from my group of 3, there was another family that was already there. Ordered the kimchi bulgogi fries, pork belly bao, and Japanese fried chicken bao. Fries were way too crispy, not enough sauce (mayo has no flavor) and bulgogi was too salty. As for the baos, the portion of meat is tiny... However, the bao itself has a nice sweet taste to it.   The three food items ended up being around $17, for that price and being around that area it's overpriced.   Would I come again? Probably not, I'll give them credit for at least trying to bring something like this to markham and the place itself being very clean."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this restaurant, but unfortunately it wasn't the greatest experience.  The location is great, the restaurant has an awesome urban look and the staff is nice.  The food however, fell short.    We ordered quite a bit of food and avoided reading other reviews so as not to taint opinions.  Overall, the baos were way too big for the small amount of protein used in any of the dishes. Also, the vegetables that are traditionally pickled (carrots, etc.) are not. This is unfortunate, as it would balance out the overpowering sauces they use for the duck confit, beef bulgogi and jerk chicken baos.  The popcorn chicken was quite tasty and did not have an oily taste.  The fish baos were the favourite, but once again, the baos seemed too large because of the small amount of fish.  The piece of actually appeared large, but it was more batter than meat.   This reataurant has a lot of potential and I'm confident that with a few refinements like using pickled veg, larger servings of protein and making the sauces a bit less overwhelming (or simply using less of it - more sauce doesn't necessarily mean better flavor) this bao joint will get many great reviews  Duck confit bao Jerk chicken bao  Beef bulgogi bao  Fish bao  Popcorn chicken"}
{"text":"I didn't have a bad taco for a very long time but this place is really disappointing! I was there for lunch the first time past Monday and the place was empty. I ordered 2 tacos ($4 Monday special) and it was really blend. The taco shell had charred mark but it was cold. The skin on the pork belly still have a few hairs attached ( sorry if this gross you out)! The girl at the cash has no smile or greeting what so ever and the kitchen looked like it hasn't been started for the day! We also ordered a bahmi with jerk chicken, again the chicken has no flavor, dry with a cold bun! Overall experience is disappointing!"}
{"text":"The food was good and there are several selections, but I think it's really small considering the price. One wasn't enough for a meal."}
{"text":"It was empty in there when I went around 3pm..we were standing in front of cash register for a good 5-7 mins waiting for someone to come take our orders.  Pricey for what you get.  It was just two of us but it did take a while for the food to come..  We had the duck confit and pork belly bao.  It was good.  Service just needs to be faster."}
{"text":"The food was very average. The menu resembles that of Banh Mi Boyz but the quality is nowhere close. The Bao is too thick, the flavors are lacking and the meat was overcooked. I don't think I'll be back"}
{"text":"I would've given the place a 3 a few months ago. However, they made some changes. They removed tacos from the menu. They also don't offer jalape√±o anymore.  They also didn't have Kim chi in any of parts of my order, including the Kim chi fries. There wasn't any Kim chi in the Kim chi fries!    They close at 7pm which I think is too early. Lastly it took 20 mins to get our order even though the place was empty. Will be difficult to come back."}
{"text":"A terrible copy of Banh MI boys   Was excited as I love Banh MI Boys but I live uptown. Very disappointed when I got my bao like it came straight out of the fridge. The veggies were flavourless and they did not have cilantro.. A key ingredient. The banh MI was not toasted and was also cold. The meat was not seasoned well and the pickled veggies lack a lot of flavour. I expected a lot more Taro fries at $5 and it really wasn't that good either. Prices are also higher than BMB."}
{"text":"came here for lunch (it's close to my office). i had the duck confit taco and the pork belly bao.  duck confit taco: very well flavoured and balanced. the duck was a little crunchy (burnt) in some places but otherwise no complaints. would eat it again.   pork belly bao: the bao was very generous and much bigger than the bao at Banh Mi Boys. the pork belly was well-flavoured but could have been more tender. i also think they overdid it with the spicy sauce, or maybe i just got a one-off, but less sauce would have been better.   will definitely come back here with coworkers! next time i'm getting the damn bulgolgi kimchi fries!"}
{"text":"Roomy, spacious place to dine in. Their food is pretty good. Very unique concept. Remembered ordering a pork belly bao, was flavourful. Their Kim chi fries were good - very crispy. I'd come here again."}
{"text":"Majorly disappointing.   The actual bao buns are large, but the meat fillings are sparse. My pork belly bao had one slice of pork belly inside the large palm-sized bao, whereas most bao places would supply you with two.  The bulgogi beef bao had roughly a tablespoon of beef in it.   I could forgive this meaty frugality, but on top of this it was altogether just super bland.  If there was any sauce in there, it must've been a minuscule amount because it was like eating raw, dry vegetables in an equally dry, plain piece of bread.    The taro fries, while they tasted OK, were mostly small leftover crumbs like they were scraped out from the bottom of the fryer (like little taro Tic-Tacs!).  $5 is a hefty price to pay for this.  Ditto for the price of a bottle of water - regular cans of pop are sold at ~$1.50 and Jarritos and other bottled soda goes at $2.50. A bottle of water (not Fiji or anything expensive) also goes at $2.50.  Yikes.   Two stars only for the polite staff.   Sadness."}
{"text":"Some of the beef inside of my bulgogi bao was still raw.  Take out order took 15 minutes.  Found it a bit too pricey for what you get.  Fried fish banh mi was a lot of batter.  Probably not coming back again...."}
{"text":"To be honest, I had put It's a Bao Time on my 'To Do' review list. I couldn't honestly come up with a review on this one after seeing the negativity on this place.  I've never experienced baos, at least not in this kind of modern format, so I don't really have anything to fall back and base a solid review on how bao's in this style are meant to be.  My fiance and I actually stumbled upon this place when we leaving after a dinner's night out at Kiku AYCE right next door, so we told ourselves we'll give it a try since it's something we've never ventured.  Upon entering, the place was completely empty. It was just me, my fiance, two staff members and a TV playing CP24. On first look, I thought the place was kept very clean, has good interior design and straight forward of where you gotta order your food. The one thing that did irk me a little is aside from the main menu right above the cashier, they've got specials written on this huge chalk board, that on first glance I thought was just for design. But there was actually a few other food options to be offered and kicked myself in the butt for not looking more carefully.  We both ordered two pork belly steamed baos and a bulgogi kimchi fries to share, or it might be called a poutine, I can't recall.  On first glance, the food looked really great! Presentation is what I expected of it since it looked relatively close to the menu picture above the cashier area, very Instagram worthy. On a personal level, I grew up never really eating pork so I have a bit of a sensitive pork tongue I guess you could say. The pork belly bao first hit me in the face with this really pungent pork flavour, though, don't hold this against the restaurant since it's not their fault, I just didn't expect the pork flavour to be that strong. For whatever reason it tastes that strongly, I will never know, but after two bites I was done with it. I did like the flavour of whatever sauce was inside, the fresh vegetables and the actual bao bread (?) itself. It was light with that perfect amount of sweetness, I actually wouldn't mind eating it on it's own!  The bulgogi kimchi fries were a bit of a disappointment though. The fries were great on their own as they held up their own crispiness and delicious flavour among the heavy hitters of the kimchi and bulgogi. What got me down about this dish was how the kimchi tasted a little old ... I know it's weird to say, but it's almost as if it was almost 'over' fermented I guess? Maybe not enough people order anything with kimchi so their using really old kimchi? I couldn't really say. The bulgogi was nothing mind blowing. It tastes like my homemade bulgogi when I had first self taught myself how to cook, that's what it reminded me of.  I really am willing to try It's a Bao Time another chance since I don't seem to know any other places like this in the Markham area as I am not as open to travelling downtown. I'm really looking forward to their Japanese karaage bao and their deep fried fish bao which also looked phenomenal!   I will most likely be giving an updated review on It's A Bao time in the near future."}
{"text":"You mean I don't have to drive downtown and pay for parking to eat Bao?? Awesome! My Markham neighbours also have a great foodie scene that's not far from home  I highly recommend going with a friend and sharing all the baos with a friend you're not afraid to exchange cooties with! That way you get to taste all the different boas in one sitting! My fav was the Japanese chicken bao. Go after 5p and get 2 can can dine baos deal for $15.   I'm already looking forward to trying for the banh mis next time around!"}
{"text":"A cozy order-at-the-counter type of restaurant which is surprisingly entirely empty.  I love banh mi - from the refrigerated ones at T&T to overpriced Banh Mi Boys and was pretty excited to try it out.  They have both banh mi's and a bao taco - great for when I'm hungry or just want a smaller meal.    For $4-6 you can get a small bao (taco shaped) though it will not fill anyone up and comes with nothing else.  The bao itself is loaded with meat and carrots but is a bit overpriced for what it is.  The banh mi costs a bit more but is obviously much bigger.  I'm happy with the flavours and the meat, but it does leave me wanting more since it doesn't come with any fries/taro chips/etc.  I did end up getting taro chips on the side and must say they're quite tasty.  Overall, not bad for a quick lunch.  It's not making me crave bao and come back but I'd be interested to try their other items on the menu."}
{"text":"This was my first time at a bao place therefore I have no other places to compare to. I really wanted to like this place because fusion restaurants sometimes cook up the most awesome dishes. A taco shaped bao filled with Asian flavours like Japanese fried chicken and wasabi? It sounds incredible right?! But unfortunately at It's A Bao Time the flavours fell flat. The Chicken wasn't properly seasoned, and the grease was overpowering. I also had the Battered Fish bao, which I preferred over the chicken, however it could've also been more flavourful. My friend had the Pork Belly and she was not impressed with seasoning either. We also got the Taro Chips as a side, and it had to be my favourite out of the entire meal.   Cool decor, good location but they need to amp up on their food game."}
{"text":"Dang, so I made the trek out to Markham today to Order The Yelp and I gotta say I don't know what people were complaining about - it was amazing! A little larger than the average Bao, but topped with a huge piece of fried chicken as well as a nice serving of Bulgogi and toppings! It was made quick and fresh to order and was so hot a burned the roof of my mouth! Loved it!  Wanting a more typical Bao experience I order the non-Yelp, but equally tempting, Duck Confit Bao. Having only had duck confit at Bahn Mi boys downtown before and in a Bahn mi instead of a Bao I was skeptical on how much better it could be. Granted the price point and the size of the Bao are less than the aforementioned BM, but that said for the same price as the Duck BM you can get 3 Bao! Each one is packed with toppings and a relatively decent amount of duck per Bao! So good.  After eating two Bao to ensure I was making an educated decision I can safely say that the Bao here are the real deal!  Eatcrest Out"}
{"text":"Came here and ordered the \"Yelp Bao\" (on special for limited time- fried chicken and bulgogi). The bun was very average- could be better if it was a little less dry. I've had much better at other places. The fried chicken was good, but the highlight was the bulgogi which was very tasty. The wasabi mayo gave the bao a nice kick. If I come back I'd get just the bulgogi bao. Don't think I would pay the regular price of $6 for this bao, but the 50% off special from the Yelp event kept me satisfied!"}
{"text":"Today is the second day for operations at this new establishment and I would have thought that they'd have a grand opening special but that was only the first day...   Me and my boyfriend ordered a battered fish Bao and pork belly Bao. I thought the fish Bao wasn't bad but my boyfriend said the pork was way too greasy.   The beef brisket bahn mi was spicy so be cautious. They didn't cut it in half which I thought was super annoying. The beef portion was really small but my boyfriend thought it was okay. I didn't enjoy it at all and stopped after one bite.   The kimchi bulgogi fries were terrible unfortunately. The texture of the beef sucks, the flavour of the beef wasn't good, and the fries were dry. It lacked sauce. It was just fries, beef and kimchi. Bahn mi boys is 100x better.   Prices are expensive for Bao and banh mi. I don't care for price considering I spend more money than normal people's rent on a monthly basis but there needs to be quality and that doesn't exist here.    It's too bad. I wonder if it will survive and if it wants to, it's going to need to adapt and change. This place is nothing like bahn mi boys so don't come here expecting that.   Again, this is only the second day of operation so maybe they haven't figured it out.... Time will tell.   This is part of the space that used to be go for tea."}
{"text":"Being honest.  It's good food (nothing special) but this is a fast food place with an extremely slow service, they don't serve the orders in order, they just jump between orders..."}
{"text":"This was a find of mine via Instagram actually, very new look, like the concept.   My favourite were the Kimchi poutine fries and bulgogi banh mi.   While the pork belly bao was not bad I've had better and I'm also picky about my pork bellies.   Is come back for sure!"}
{"text":"ordered the Kim Chi fries and they're just decent. the meat on top is really good however you do not get a lot of it and the warm Kim chi tastes kinda off to me as I prefer it served cold."}
{"text":"Happy to see more small restaurants hitting York region.    The concept of the place is really nice, but not sure if it is a dinner spot as shockingly for Markham, they close at 8pm.  Prices are a bit high for what it is as I would want more of a tasting menu prices and try many things.  First I want to say, the kimchi bulgogi fries were delicious.   The salt from the bulgogi mixed with a sweetness in their kimchi which topped a fresh crispy fries was quite delicious.   The highlight was their Japanese fried chicken bao.   This was quite tasty.   Next favourite was the pork belly, which could have been more fatty.   Portions were actually better than I expected.  The bahn mi although most fillings are the same as the bao but on a Kaiser bun, was a bit disappointing.   Not sure why the bread was soggy considering it was made fresh (I assume), but had the consistency of day old bread.   There are a few other things I would want to try on the menu.  As an alternative dining experience I would say there are some things that could be done better, but hopefully it will continue to do better.  Look forward ton trying the rest of the menu. So would go again and give it another chance."}
{"text":"Order the Yelp! This week only, the Yelp bao is being offered for $3. This bao has a deep fried chicken AND bugolgi filling complemented with daikon, carrots, and a touch of cilantro.  It was honestly pretty delicious. I'll admit I've had better deep fried chicken baos at Banh Mi Boys, BUT, given the price that it is right now, it's really a steal of a deal. I would highly recommend you go check it out!  I also tried the deep fried fish banh mi because I was allured by the guacamole topping. That one was just ehh. I personally enjoyed the crunch of the coleslaw and daikon, but it made the batter of the fish become soggy pretty fast. There also wasn't enough guacamole to make a detectable difference. My boyfriend had the jerk chicken banh mi and commented that it could use more chicken. He said it had a slight hint of spice so it wasn't too overwhelming and it was generously topped with a corn salad.   The interior of this place is great - cozy and modern. I love the spray paint job on the main wall, it really adds to the atmosphere of this \"cool, laid back, bao joint\"."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this bao place out because ever since I visited Baohaus in New York I've been craving fusion bao places. With Banh Mi Boys only having locations downtown, this was the closest I would get to it in Markham.  I ordered the duck confit bao, my friend ordered the pork belly bao, and we ordered the bulgogi fries to share. The baos were extremely disappointing and underwhelming. The bun felt too tough, the duck was cold and lacked in flavour, and the pork belly couldn't even compare to the taste of BMB or Baohaus. The only thing that saved this place was their bulgogi fries and yet I've still had better bulgogi fries at other places.  Save your money and satisfy your craving elsewhere."}
{"text":"Service was good. I had the Yelp Bao which has fried chicken and bulgogi in it. The sandwich itself was too salty for me, and the chicken in it was very bland. The breading on the chicken could have been crispier.   The Kimchi fried was the best part of my meal. I'd come back for that. Also tried the taro chips, which I thought were pretty boring.   The place itself may be a tad hard to find if you're not familiar with that plaza. It's located in the back of plaza."}
{"text":"Came here for #ordertheyelp and what a deal for $3! The fried chicken bulgogi bao combination sounds too good to be true!   It's a \"large\"  sized bao so a bit extra to fill you up. I personally should have ordered two! The bao is soft and moist, the bulgogi was great (want more!). The fried chicken was the only weak part it felt like a pre fried stored in the freezer type of thing. I was expecting \"karage\"  sort of thing.   I also ordered the taro chips, they were ok with spicy mayo. $3 for them but would probably just pay the $6 for the kimchi fries since they were fantastic!  I think the full price of the bao is a little much for what you get. I don't see much value from it. They also have deals throughout the week. I think one was 2 baos and fries for $15.  The interior and bathrooms were clean the service was good."}
{"text":"I had the Korean one and the pork belly one.  The Korean one was ok, but it could have used some more kimchi to kick up the flavor.  The pork belly was bad.  I was expecting the fat to be rendered and crisped up.  It was a soft fatty piece of meat.  It wasn't a good mouth feel."}
{"text":"Seems like It's a Bao Time didn't have a really good time when it first opened up, given the mediocre reviews. But here I am, a few months later, stuffing bao into my face at a ferocious velocity with sauce dripping down my hands. It's a Bao to get messy.   Thanks to the Order the Yelp event, I was able to give myself an excuse to try this place. Whatever the opinion was at the beginning, I don't care, because things have definitely started looking upwards for this place. Came around 2 to an empty restaurant and expected to get one bao each for myself and my SO. The food was ready in 5-10 minutes, which gave us a good amount of time to admire the cute chalk drawings covering one side of the restaurant. We started with:   The Yelp Bao ($6, but $3 with check-in until June 30): Japanese fried chicken and bulgogi. Ok I've never really had bao before, but are they always so soft and sweet? It was like a thick blanket of goodness cradling a menage a trois of crispy, tender chicken, flavourful bulgogi, and pickled carrots.   The Duck Confit Bao ($4.99): A bit smaller than the Yelp but the duck was juicy and the sauce it used was very delicious.   Because we knew we had discovered something special, we ordered two more before I even finished my first one:   The Pork Belly Bao ($4.69): I was actually a little scared of the thickness of the pork belly as I saw my beach body dreams flash and vanish before my eyes. But I couldn't resist. It was juicy and decadent. The pickled carrots and chipotle mayo was the perfect way to cut through the bacon-y grease.  The Japanese Fried Chicken ($4.99): Didn't get to try this one, but if it's similar to the Yelp Bao (which it probably is), then it must have been tasty.    Whatever you did to improve yourself in the last few months, KEEP DOING IT. I'm hoping that one day, I will come back and see this place bustling with people, even at 2pm. Hopefully not too bustling though, as I foresee many future returns and many more baos to enjoy.  (63/100) - 2016"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my coworkers. We were all very excited to try this place as we all love banh mi boy and were assuming it would be the same.  I ordered the Japanese fried chicken bao and pork belly bao with taro chips. Was slightly disappointed in the chicken because it wasn't one whole piece of chicken, rather multiple little pieces of chicken. Still tasted good. The pork belly was good too. Only thing is that I wish they used better topics. Just cilantro and pickled carrots would have been perfect (don't like iceberg lettuce).  The taro chips are AMAZING. Skip the potatoes and opt for the taro instead - they're super seasoned, crispy, and flavourful."}
{"text":"I came here a few times about a year ago, and today I didn't want to head downtown for food. so I'm surprised that it's a bit time is still here considering the food quality has gone down.   Now the kimchi bulgogi fries no longer has kimchi in it! They should change the name.... I would have ordered something else. I'm surprised when I asked the cashier where is the kimchi and she replied that there is no longer kimchi in the fries... just a few green onion and drops of mayo.   Also got the battered fish bao, but it was a square shape! Was awkward to eat it cause the bao can't contain it. so much batter I could not find the fish. The bao was not fresh and fluffy, it was kinda hard and dry.  Also tacos are no longer on the Manu.  Fries are still too crispy in the outside with no potato on the inside.   Only good thing is that there is plenty of parking in front"}
{"text":"Finally! A Vietnamese inspired street food restaurant located within the GTA! definitely similar to banh mi boyz. The place itself is very hipster and modern theme. Loved the chalk board and graffiti surrounding the restaurant! The pricing is relatively affordable, all the food is under 10$. Each day of the week has a deal, recommend to go on a Tuesday! 2 Bo+ taro chips for 10$.   The baos were moist and fluffy and definitely fulling. Go for the Japanese fried chicken, it's my best choice! Tip: be careful if you are getting the pork belly, the pork was very chewy and took a long time to eat, that's for sure lol   I'll come back for sure, and try the kimchi fries!"}
{"text":"OVERPRICED AND LONG WAIT:    Don't let the cute pun fool you into walking into this overpriced, mediocre eatery!  Wow, is this bao restaurant pricey relative to the other bao restaurants in the GTA.  It cost $4.99 per bao and you definitely need 2 baos, a side (eg, their poutine) and a drink for a full meal.  As such, it would cost almost $20 after taxes for what should be a quick, simple meal.  We tried the duck confit bao and it was very dry and chewy.  The fish bao was fresher and flakey though and we would recommend it.   We went there at lunch time on a Saturday and the place was almost empty.  It should not had taken 15 min for the food to be prepared.  There were four of us and it took several trips up to the counter to get our food.  They did not serve it all at once to us so that was a little annoying.  Also, they do not announce the food is ready so you have to constantly check the counter.  Other bao restaurants with comparable quality costs about $3.50 per bao or $6.50 for two.  We will NOT be returning to this slow and pricey restaurant."}
{"text":"My first time here and I enjoyed the Kimchi Bulgogi Fries and the Fried Chicken Bao. The decor in the restaurant is clean but modern with a urban feel.   The bao is only about the size of a small hand but, the ingredients were fresh and flavourful. A little expensive for something about the size of a taco. But, the Kimchi Bulgogi Fries were worth the price and much more filling than one bao. I recommend you try these fries if you like spicy food, kimchi and beef/bulgogi.  Staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Oh it's a Bao Time... My boyfriend and I were super excited to try this place as we usually trek down to Eglinton for Banh Mi Boys.  After one visit I think we will stick to BMB.  We tried 3 different flavoured Baos.  Fish taco: puny portion and flavourless guac. The bao themselves were old? Or over cooked? I dont know something was off though.   Japanese Fried Chicken: the breading of the chicken tasted burnt, although it was a generous slice it did not suffice. The veggies didnt taste fresh. Neither of us completely finished because it wasnt that appetizing. For a place with bao right in the name youd think they would be great!  Bulgogi bao: bulgogi was good, again...dat bao doe.   Then the bulgogi kimchi fries: I knew to try this because it came highly recommended on Yelp. It was a good dish and I do recommend it...but my FAVOURITE part of that dish was the actual fries themselves. They taste like fries you get at a beach shack. Perfectly fried and crispy. I want so badly to take those fries and put them in the same menu item at Banh Mi Boys lmao.   Anyways it's worth a try if you're just looking to satisfy a quick craving but it's certainly nothing that will sway me from my appreciation of banh mi boys.      (I dont think everything is kept super fresh because its a ghost town in there due to an awkward location)"}
{"text":"Order The Yelp!!! Came here to try their special.  Japanese fried chicken, bulgogi bao.  The chicken was nice and crispy and moist. Bulgogi had a sweetness to compliment the crunch.   It was pretty empty on a Saturday afternoon, very modern decorations with high ceilings.  It had a bit of a food court feeling, which is a first in this Plaza.  The service was pretty slow, one kitchen staff and one cashier.  When the cashier was done getting our order, she would go to the back and help out with the order.  I can't imagine if this place gets busy, how they would keep up.   Right when you walk in there is a chalkboard with a lot of their daily specials.  It's very unique with drawings, and customer's signing.   I would come back to try their other baos, but it's a little pricey as one bao doesn't seem to be enough.    They had samples of their taro chips next total the cashier.  I had a small piece and it wasn't bad, didn't have too much seasoning."}
{"text":"It's abao time the food is ready! The place is empty and still took 15 min to get our bao and banh mi. Nothing special, banh mi boys downtown is way better."}
{"text":"It was totally empty on a Sunday evening, so that's usually a not-so-good sign for me. However, I wanted to go and I must say that it is exactly a 3 star rating.  If you are comparing the bao to Bahm mi boys, you will be sorely disappointed because it is really not in the same league. However, it is a decent place to get an asian fusion sandwich.  We had the chicken fried bao, fish bao, bulgogi taco, and bulgogi kimchi fries. The chicken was the best and my kid liked his taco. However, the bao isn't fluffy, it is dense. And, the cold slaw isn't korean cold slaw, just shredded vegetables.  The price is right and the atmosphere is nice too."}
{"text":"It's pretty darn good! Not sure why some are so critical on here, maybe I just lucked out? Ordered the 1. duck bao and the 2. pork belly bao. Didn't get to eat it until an hour and a half later and it was still good a little soggy still amazinnnngg! Thought the pork belly was perfecto and the duck meat super flavourful but didn't find the white cream sauce paired that well with duck meat. :/ Other than that, from what i had I can say the meat is quality grade the bao is fresh and soft, some items just needs a little tweak with the sauce pairing and it could be perfect. Hope the ratings on here gets corrected soon cause there is no other comparable place nearby for a quick burgeresque bite other then McDonalds and the sorts and this by farrrr is better than the questionable reconstituted patties they serve."}
{"text":"I had the duck confit and the Japanese fried chicken baos, fries, and a mango soda. The baos were decent but nothing to write home about, the needed more sauce and the carrot and cucumber were limp and flavorless. The fries I didn't like, they reminded me of the coated ones you'd get in high school cafeterias except plumper, and a few fries had some really thin plastic thread tangled around them! And the mango soda bottle cap was half opened already so the soda was a bit flat. I'd rather go to Banh Mi Boys but I thought I'd give this place a try since I was in the neighborhood. Oh well. Live and learn. The decor is great though."}
{"text":"Such a yummy place in richmond hill! Of course when you compare it to places like taiwan, or hk, you won't be impressed. It's like that anywhere you go honestly. Comparison will be the death of us.   The place is big, and cute. If you're a broke student, you have found your home. I find that the bao, banh mi and little side dishes are super cheap and definitely worth the price. I'm also really happy that they have veggie options! I got the veggie bao that was made with tofu, carrots, cilantro, yummy sauce and a very yummy bao. Seriously, I really adored the bao- it was so thick, and the texture was amazing.. perfect amount of chewiness. Ahhhhmazing.   Staff are extremely friendly and efficient! The owner, Wendy is an absolute gem and she is definitely one of the sweetest girls ever! It's great when they ask for feedback on their food, so they know what to improve on.  I'm such a big fan. It's not everyday you find a place that can do vegan options for you without making it extremely overpriced or skimping out on a recipe.. they can do vegan/gluten free banh-mi as well! Just ask!"}
{"text":"From what many others have said since this place has opened, it seems they have figured some things out and are pretty decent now. While it doesn't match the quality of other bao places, it's still a respectable option without the need of going far for those of us in the Markham/Richmond Hill area and I appreciate that.   Before I breakdown the individual items, the overall flavour theme is SWEET and SALTY. If you don't like that combination, then you probably won't like these or the entire concept of these restaurants. For me, I love these two flavours. Some might think it's too much. Especially if you get the bulgogi, then it's the sweetness of the bulgogi, adding on top of the sweetness of the kimchi, the sauce, the carrots, AND the bao. Like everything is sweet!   Japanese fried chicken bao - not karaage, it's more like panko breaded chicken. Served with a sweet soy based sauce.  Battered fish - probably the better one of the two. Light and crunchy fish that contrasts the baos well with mayo. It was less intense in flavour in a good way than the others due to the lack of a sweet sauce.  Bulgoggi Bahn Mi - really enjoyed this. It was packed with ingredients. A good amount of sweet bulgogi, with kimchi, carrots, raddish, jalape√±os, corn, cucumbers and more. The bread was toasted crisp and the entire thing packed some serious sweet and salty flavour.   Bulgogi kimchi fries - okay but way too salty. Don't know what made the fries so salty. Also, I expected better fries, it was a tad cold and were frozen fries. I like my fries freshly cut with the skin on - see Bahn Mi Boys kimchi fries. Otherwise, there was a healthy amount of toppings.  All in all, it's a bao time is a pretty decent fast food place to get these 'fusion' baos and Bahn Mi although some improvements would be welcome."}
{"text":"I guess more of 2.5 stars. its a good alternative if you are uptown and cant get Banh Mi Boys. Came here on a Friday night, there was a family of 3 in the restaurant and myself and a friend, so it was not busy. The flooring was also slightly sticky, but not sure if that was just the tiles they have.   I got the fried chicken bao, it was frankly quite sloppily put together and falling apart. The lettuce was a bit soggy and the bun felt kinda slimy from it. I also got the Bulgogi kim chi fries, no complaints here. The portion was reasonable, fries were crispy. Enough kimchi, beef and green onions.   I would go back just because its the only place uptown for baos, but would not be running back anytime soon. Just holding your cravings in and go downtown"}
{"text":"Came to this restaurant on a rainy day, it was quite empty inside. We ordered pork belly, bulgogi beef bao and kimchi bulgogi fries. The order was in at 3:12pm and we waited for 20mins for our food when there was no other customer beside us. Food presentations looked nice and colourful...definitely not messy. Bao are pretty tasty, a bit blend on the pork belly one and I wish they could warm the bao a bit more before serving. Fries are wayyyy tooooo crispy, I couldnt even poke it in with fork. Hopefully those problems can be improved as its only their first week into the business."}
{"text":"I'm always looking for new places to try out in Markham. The pocket of Markham/Richmond Hill where It's Abao time is,  has some super great places to eat at, so I was sold on trying it out. Plus the pics on their website didn't leave me thinking twice about going.  I stopped in on a Saturday just after 1pm (they open at 12pm). There was only 1 table with 2 people eating. I already knew what i was going to order for everyone, so i went up to order. First: no personality on the staff working there. No smile, no hello - nothing! 3 out of 4 things i tried to order, they were out of?  Really? They open at 12pm. If a place of business is planning on staying open until 7pm and can't provide 3/4 of their staple menu ingredients why even open the doors? We settled on 6 items plus fries (4 adults) for take out and went home to eat. My first problem with the food was, that all the sandwiches were put into a bag that was way too small. The wrappers were so hard to take off some of the buns, that the buns fell apart.  None of them looked like their advertised tacos & bao buns on their website or even on Yelp for that matter. I was not impressed at all at how dry and small the chicken was. The pork belly was so undercooked that i gagged when i bite into it. It's supposed to be \"roasted pork belly\", it looked like it had been boiled. Everything tasted the same, well because all the toppings are the same give or take 1-2 different sauces. All bun & veggies, with very little meat. Trying to be fair, we did give them a 2nd chance and went back with the same friends. Honestly, it was no better the 2nd time around."}
{"text":"Tasty morsels packed into a soft Asian bun.  I stopped in for a lunch and ordered the battered fish bao, and pork belly bao.  The bun is fresh and soft, and the fillings are tasty.  The fish was nicely cooked, which can really reveal a bad joint if they can't get the fish right.    These buns can get messy, so be prepared with enough nappys!  Small portions, but that makes it easier to sample multiple items, and at between $4 and $5 each, variety is on the menu.  I need to stop back and try a few more variations."}
{"text":"Was supposed to go somewhere else but saw this place and wanted to try it out.   It's a Bao time (it's about time) Hahaha, good pun.   Anyways,  on Tuesdays they have a 2 bao's  or 2 tacos plus taro chips or fries for 10$ which is a great deal.  They have good options for types of baos and tacos.   I ordered the pork belly and the Japanese fried chicken bao along with the taro chips.    Took about 5 min to receive my order.   Overall the taste was really good (not as good as banh mi   BoyZ) but it's pretty damn close.  The pork belly was good but kinda chewy.  The Japanese fried chicken was good but a small piece that I mostly ate bao instead of chicken.  Taro chips were fresh and tasted good.    It was a good experience here,  staff are friendly,  nice seating arrangements,  clean.  I recommend this place to people who can travel all the way downtown for banh mi boyz.  This place is real good"}
{"text":"Was here on Wednesday night with a bunch of friends. I thought the food was delicious and creative. It does take a bit of time for your order to be prepared but it's nice to know your food is prepared fresh! The JFC Bao is amazing. Going to try the Bulgogi next time!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! The first time I found out about them I went there 2 times on the weekend. The staff is awesome! Great customer service!  I bought the Korean beef bao and taro chips. They have really good deals during the week which I recommend taking advantage of! The place has a modern urban feel that connects to the community"}
{"text":"Lots of parking available and i think the only place in the richmond hill markham area to get this type of fusion baos. We ordered a pork belly bao, korean bulgogee bao and a bulgogee fries.  The pork belly bao was underwhelming as the fatty piece of the pork belly didn't seem to rendered down enough  so it was chewy enough that it wasn't edible.  However the Korean bulgogee bao was good with fresh ingredients that I would ordered again.  Bulgogee fries was the best thing on the order with lots of bulgogee over kimchi and fries.  I will try the Japanese chicken (karrage) bao or fish next time I visit."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place as my wife and I are fans of Banh Mi Boy (Benchmark). The cashier was very helpful when I asked for recommendations. I ordered a pork belly bao and fried chicken bao, along with the jerk chicken and beef Banh mi. As a fan of the kimchi fries from downtown, I ordered the kimchi bulgogi fries, however, I was disappointed to find out the kimchi was removed because of the \"owner's decision\" (so bulgogi on fries).  Firstly, the bao was quite dry and not as soft as usual baos. The fried chicken was very very fried which is crispy but I couldn't even taste chicken. The pork belly was not bad, quite tasty. The banh mi tasted better then it looked. I enjoyed the jerk chicken as the spice of the jerk and spiciness of the siracha went well with the bun.  Finally, the bulgogi fries was very salty but with the fries, it works.  If you have a craving, then It's Bao Time is an option but if I have time, I would consider other options."}
{"text":"So today was grand opening day so we decided to check out the place during lunch.  We've probably went on the wrong day because they weren't ready to serve a huge crowd.  It's a fast food style resto.  You go up and order and wait for your number to be called.  Order taking was slow.  Food took a while to come out.  They definitely need some kind of microphone system because people could barely hear the numbers being called out.  We're order fish bao, pork belly bao, taro fries and kimchi fries.  I'm use to huge portions for the price I've paid.  Eating one bao for lunch is not enough. I would need at least 2 baos.  The bao does taste good - in fact both the pork belly and fish was good.  The pork belly was melt in your mouth goodness.  The bao itself is fluffy with a slight sweetness to it.  It was perfect.  The taro fries in my opinion was pretty awful.  It tasted like stale soggy fries.  There was no crunch what so ever.  The amount of dipping sauce provided was a joke.  The kimchi fries on the other hand is much better.  The price tag for a bao is just under $5, so imagine order 2, that's like $10 just to fill your tummy.  If you want kimchi fries, tag on another $6.  There's so many other options in the area in that price range.  At least right now they are doing a grand opening special of 10% off, so if you want to give it a try, you should go now.  Would I go back?  Probably not, unless I happen to be not too hungry and I just wanted a snack for lunch."}
{"text":"The Bao craze continues - but this time in Markham! I came here for the first time last week and I have heard mixed reviews about this place prior to coming. However, I am always a believer in seeing and experiencing things first hand before making a solid judgement - especially when it comes to food. Of course, to give a fair review I wanted to try everything I could possibly fit in my tummy in one go.   Here is the list:  - Pork Belly Bao:: Of course we must go for the classic first! Let me start by saying I loved the bao (the white bun) itself - very fluff and delicious. The filling was very generous - 2 pieces of flavorful (albeit fatty) pork belly garnished with veggies. Even though it is pork belly, the slices that we got were still a bit too fatty for my taste - I usually prefer a good balance of meat and fat.  - Jerk Chicken Bao:: *THIS IS SPICY*. I know it says so on the menu but to those who are still wondering, this little bao does have a kick to it! That said, the aroma was compelling, the flavor delicious, and again the portion definitely filling.  - Japanese Fried Chicken Bao:: This was my favourite one (ordered another one even after I was stuffed). Say what you may but I always appreciate fried chicken that is cooked to perfection. Crispy, great seasoning, and juicy in the middle. To use unagi sauce? I loved the idea and would definitely get it again! - Duck Confit Taco:: Talk about rich flavour! This taco was nothing short of impressive in terms of flavor, cook, aroma, and presentation. Crispy, juicy and perfect amount of fatty goodness. That hoisin mayo was a perfect accompaniment to this dish.  - Bulgogi Kimchi Fries:: This received a mixed feedback from my group. Overall, we agreed it was yummy but the fries were definitely soggy and it ended up being a little more \"mushy\" than we anticipated.   The only thing I would have really wanted to try would have been the fish bao (sold out) and the dessert Bao. Overall, I enjoyed the food and the environment was comfortable with excellent staff."}
{"text":"Dropped in out of curiosity. Got two baos. They tasted good but since it takes two to fill up/not feel hungry, I think it's a bit pricey. I think they would benefit if they had a buy one get second half off special.  The baos I tried were the pork belly and the Korean beef bulgogi, wouldn't get the pork belly again but the beef bulgogi would make a yummy snack. - OH, I did however like how soft and tasty the actual bun was."}
{"text":"Note to other YELPERS: if a place is empty at 7:30pm, walk, NO , RUN THE F--- away!!! I made that mistake tonight when I dropped by this place.  Don't be deceived by the parking, those are all patrons of CONGEE QUEEN.   I ordered a bulgogi banh mi - it was EXTREMELY salty. It's beef cooked in salt topped with salty sauce and topped with salty kimchi. This sandwich must have exceeded the % Daily value of sodium recommended in a 2000 calorie diet.   Next was the duck bao. It was COLD, tasteless and oily as hell. Someone must have decided that since my banh mi was too salty, that they should leave this one bland. Think I'm exaggerating on the oiliness? See the pic I uploaded. Pics don't lie!  Now for the finale - the pork belly bao. The bao was bland and pork extremely dry. The pork belly is one of the juiciest  cuts of pork -- and these people still messed it up.   I won't be surprised if this place closed soon -- and once they do people will say .. IT'S A BAO TIME ... Bwahahaha"}
{"text":"Had high expectation as Asian is known for their baos!  Before I head there on a Sunday morning, my friend was warning me to expect long wait.  Arrived the shop with instant seatings.  To be fair I think this place is a good option for a quick weekday lunch.  However being uptown with so many cheap Asian meal option, this will not be my go to place.  Bao is thick and dry, not enough meat and on pricy side.  I prefer mean bao downtown way over this shop, cheaper tastier and better quality bao.  Quite disappointed:("}
{"text":"Snack size menu that can be enjoyed when you aren't too hungry. I actually like the kimchi fries more than the Bao. Friend ordered the pork belly while I ordered the fried fish one. Overall my experience was ok, not bad, i like the fact that they are quite spacious, just orders took longer than I expected."}
{"text":"We ordered the Yelp Bao.  Disregarding the value as the price was super low, the bao tasted decent.  The fried chicken was of a reasonable size.  It had a crispy coat.  The meat inside wasn't dry.  The Korean beef was sweet and not chewy.  The bao was juicy overall, so it made a small and delicious mess.  We also had the Bulgogi Kimchi fries.  The flavour was bold (aka not boring).  I don't like the bulgogi flavour on fries, so this flavours combination was not my cup of tea.  The kimchi could taste spicier.  One bao makes a very small lunch.  I suppose most people would need more than one bao for lunch."}
{"text":"Ordered the bulgogi kimchi fries and a pork belly bao. The fries were good but had a small amount of toppings and the beef was slightly burnt. The pork belly bao was very bad on the day I went (maybe on other days it's better, who knows). The single slice of pork was tough and dry. The skin that was left on was very, very rubbery (I could barely bite through, it was that bad) and not soft and gelatinous like it should be. They should be really ashamed to have even served this pork belly to customers honestly."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night and it didn't look too busy but had to wait over 30 minutes for the food. Ordered the fish bao, pork belly bao, and the kimchi fries.  The price was reasonable (under $5 for a bao).  It wasn't really filling, but would make for a great snack.  The pork belly was really fat with very little meat so I wasn't a big fan on this one.  The fish bao however, was very crispy and hot with lots of coleslaw, would recommend everyone to try this one.  The Kimchi fries were mediocre, the sauce and kimchi was a good touch however I didn't really enjoy the fries. All in all, it's a decent place for a small snack and I would come back once in awhile."}
{"text":"Came here Dec 27, 2016 at 6:45 store was CLOSED! Even though hours said it would be open till 8  Update: Sent an email and was actually offered a discount on our next visit. We did end up going back to try. Kim chi fries are recommended, most else was \"ok\". Portions were not the biggest.  The pork belly bao had a lot of fat - I would say a 65-35 ratio of fat to meat. Would be nicer if it was a bit more 50-50  4 stars for service, 3.5 stars for taste, and 3 stars for portions"}
{"text":"You order and pickup your food at the counter when its ready. The place was completely empty when I arrived at around 2:00pm.  Pork bell bao $4.69 - the pork belly meat was a bit tough on some parts. The pork belly bao at Mama Bear Taiwanese Cuisine is way, way better. The fatty parts are suppose to melt in your mouth but that didn't happen at this joint.  Bulgogi bao $4.69 - decent amount of meat. There was some kimchii flavours in the veggie parts. Very messy to eat. Sauce is dripping everywhere and it made the bao soggy.  I think specializing in bao's is not a bad idea since there are not too many around but the quality is not there. The location is terrible located at the back of the plaza. One person taking orders, one person preparing food. Seemed like a high school cafeteria type setup. Its more of a fast food bao at best. Don't think this place will last much longer."}
{"text":"Great little spot good for lunch. Bao for 5 bucks filled with all kinds of goodness. The bolgogi sandwich was awesome with corn inside. It is a clean new spot"}
{"text":"All in all a great place to eat. We had the bulgogi kimchi fries, fish taco, jerk chicken bao sandwich, and the Japanese fried chicken bao sandwich. Although the fries could have been a little more saucy (slightly more mayo would've been great), all the food was delicious.   The restaurant itself was cute and the service was good, too. Will be returning here for sure."}
{"text":"A little disappointing as I was hoping for a Bami Boys experience. The pork belly was yummy but the toppings (pickled veggies etc seem weak).   Also we ordered the kimchi bul go go fries. But after paying and waiting for it, we were surprised to find out there wasn't any Kimchi!  The person simply said, oh we don't have kimchi so we're just giving fires with bul go gi and a 'oh the other person didn't tell you?'!  My wife was like \"where's the Kimchi \"!  No sorry, nothing from the restaurant.   Any how, food overall was ok but no we're not likely coming back."}
{"text":"We came here on a Friday night and found ourselves waiting over 30 minutes for our order. My fianc√© and I ordered the pork belly bao, battered fish bao and bugolgi kimchi fries:  - Pork belly bao (~$4.50): The piece of pork belly, was probably 80% fat and was a very small piece...I had several bites with no pork belly or pickled raddish at all. Did not really enjoy this one.  - Battered fish bao (~$4.70): I really enjoyed this one, though it wasn't warm (due to the long wait?).. there was a large piece of battered fish with tons of coleslaw!  - Bugolgi kimchi fries ($6): This was probably my favourite item that we tried..the fries were perfectly crispy and fresh...generous amount of kimchi, bugolgi and mayo/sauce.. they also layered the toppings throughout so it wasn't all on top and left with plain fries at the bottom.  Overall.. the food was decent but I don't think I'd come back as the wait was pretty ridiculous for fast food/snack. The d√©cor inside was very nice, high ceilings and ample seating. I noticed on the chalk board wall that they have certain specials on different days of the week that may be worth checking out."}
{"text":"Had the Tuesday special - 2 baos and a side of fries or taro chips for $10. I chose the pork belly bao and the duck confit bao and upgraded my fries to the bulgogi kimchi fries for an additional $3. Spent just under $15 - didn't get a drink.   I was looking forward to trying this place out when I first saw the sign- it's new and has been in business for about 3-4 months. I'd like to note that I've had Momo Fuku's pork baos and once you've had those, there really isn't anything that can compete.   The bao bun itself was quite nice - soft and not too heavy. It complemented the fillings.   The pork bao was topped with some cucumbers and carrots. I added some sriracha for the kick. I was however, missing the hoisin sauce that the Momo Fuku pork bao has. The pork belly slice was larger than Momo Fuku's, and although it was palatable, I felt that the grease would've been a bit overwhelming had I of ordered 2.   My attraction to 'fancy' sounding menu items with a fastfood lunch time budget didn't do me any favours this time either. The duck confit looked more like dried pieces of beef jerky. I was imagining delicate pulled pieces of duck in a warm soft bao. You wouldn't of been able to notice if the meat was duck, beef or chicken.   The bulgogi kimchi fries was layered as such: fries, kimchi then topped with bulgogi marinated beef pieces and green onions. With two baos, the bulgogi fries was a lot. The meat pieces were a little overcooked and I personally like my bulgogi to have more sauce. Kimchi kind of disappeared and I wish it was placed either last or on the side because I like my kimchi cold.   Overall, it wouldn't hurt to try it out. it's a nice place to sit with the bright orange chairs and wood laminated walls. Parking is accessible and if you don't like what you see, there's other places in the plaza for you to check out. It'll probably be a while till I feel like venturing back to try something new - but $15 is just $4 shy of The Host which is across the street."}
{"text":"*Just like the name suggested, the restaurant specialized in baos, but also banh mi and surprisingly Asian fusion tacos!   *Similarly to the concept of Banh Mi Boys, you are supposed to order at the cashier, pick up your food when it's ready and seat anywhere. However the space at It's a bao time was more spacious and it was really clean.  *Though It's a Bao Time is a nice addition to the uptown food scene, sadly to say this place is nothing like Banh Mi Boys or Mean Bao, so don't come here and expect the food to have the same quality as those restaurants.   -Pork Belly bao (roasted pork belly, lettuce with hoisin mayo) - $4.69 For $5 the bao was tiny and the pork belly was like a piece of bacon. I could tell the meat was frozen and it lacked any sort of flavors. The vegetables were just... cold lettuce with carrots, thus it would have been better to pickled the carrots to cut the fattiness of the pork belly. There was also supposed to be a hoisin mayo sauce but I couldn't taste any of it. The bao itself was cold and not as soft as the ones I had in downtown, overall a very disappointing dish.  -Duck Confit taco (peking duck confit, lettuce and hoisin mayo) - $4.99 The duck confit was packed with flavors, tender and juicy! I think more sauce would have been nice and the taco shell was able to held all the ingredients together without breaking apart. Again what's with the raw and bland vegetables?  -Korean Beef Bulgogi (seared Korean beef bulgogi, spicy kimchi, jalapeno, corn, scallion, and bulgogi sauce) - $4.99 The beef was soft and really good as well but lacked that sweetness that you often find in Korean beef bulgogi. The taco itself was not too spicy and I found the corn was a nice addition to cut the heat from the jalapeno. My only complain was that there was too much bulgogi sauce, either they added some extra or it came from the meat... I literally picked up the taco and tilted it for a good 20 seconds to get all the sauce out before proceeding."}
{"text":"Nice to finally have an alternative to Banh Mi Boys (BMB) outside the downtown core, but it needs work.  To start, the location in my opinion is definitely not ideal for a brand new restaurant. Located at the back of the Commerce Valley Drive restaurant plaza, \"It's a Bao Time\" (IABT) set up camp at part of the space which was once occupied by Go For Tea. If you didn't know that Go For Tea had closed in that location (like I did) and didn't stumble upon the restaurant by accident, you'd probably have a hard time trying to figure out where IABT was located.   The restaurant itself is nice and very clean with a very modern and casual vibe to it. Menu board on top of the register/pick-up window with lots of seats. I visited on a Friday night and it was fairly empty save for another family dining in. I hope it was only busy due to them being a new business..  Selection was just what I'd expect from a BMB style joint, with pricing I believe to be relatively close to their Toronto counterparts. I ordered the Pork Belly Bao ($4.69) and a Beef Bulgogi Banh-mi ($6.89) as well as a Jarrito ($3) and waited about 5-10min for my food to come.   The bao was first and I felt it was a fairly decent size. It was definitely packed in nicely with the toppings as per the menu board, however I did find that the meat was clumped together fairly tightly. Same thing happened for my banh-mi, as I ended up finishing all the meat before I could finish the rest of the sandwich and its other toppings. I do believe that a single banh-mi alone could've filled me up though, as I had some slight regret eating two sandwiches around halfway to finishing my banh-mi...  Overall not a bad place to go check out if you're craving baos or banh-mi's if you've got cravings you need to cure AND don't wanna travel downtown if you're not from the area. I'll probably be back once my cravings return!"}
{"text":"It was about an hour before closing that we arrived, but I definitely thought it would have been more busy. We were the only ones in there! Perhaps, its the inconspicuous location that is leading to lower levels of traffic? Or maybe it was simply because everything was closing down by the time we arrived. Well it didn't matter at this point; we were definitely hungry so we ordered a few things off the menu. At first, I wasn't sure if it would be enough food, but I was definitely wrong. I was so full!   First I tried the duck confit bao ($4.99) - The confit itself was a little bit dry and not as succulent as you would expect from a confit. It was also- from what I can remember a little but unseasoned. It didn't taste like there was enough salt. What really made this bao sub-par was the dry bun. It just made everything even worse.   The Japanese fried chicken bao ($4.69) was much better. Maybe its in my head, but I feel like anything fried Japanese style tastes so good! Karaage and tempura are two must have for me at every sushi outing. It was nice to have it in the bao form. The meat was juicy and well seasoned. Unlike the duck confit bao, this one was much better which means that, yes, they can serve a moist bao.   Their Beef bulgogi banh mi ($6.89) was actually good. To be honest, my only other experience with banh mi is from foody mart, so I really have no solid baseline to compare this with. But I think if someone were hungry and they were to eat this sandwich with a bao, they would be full. What I can say about this is that it needs a more sauciness going on. Bulgogi sauce is so good so more of it in the sandwich would make it much better.   Pork belly taco ($4.69) was probably my least favourite item. The tortilla was hard, as if it was microwaved. Needless to say, it could have been better in a well steamed bao. The pork belly itself is not the usual melt-in-your- mouth pork belly as it was quite hard. The fat needs to be cooked longer in order to get that desired state.   Bulgogi kimchi fries ($6). These fries were delicious. As an added bonus, all of your concerns about satiation will be wiped out with a few bites. Even split between two people, these fries are really filling. They are saucy (which I love if you cant tell already) and the kimchi is buried beneath layer of meat. At first I was wondering why the hell there is no Kimchi in these Kimchi fries, but its there!"}
{"text":"It's a Bao Time is a fusion restaurant located in Markham, serving different kind of buns, such as Chinese buns, Mexican taco, and Vietnamese bahn mi.   The restaurant's name is a clever pun (It's about time), and it is located in the space of former Go for Tea in Richmond Hill. It is a fast food style place with bright and colorful decorations. The back wall is an impressive mural, with an actual working clock hidden on the side.  It's a Bao Time is best for lunch for all the offices around the area. They serve different kind of buns, bahn mi, and taco, stuffed with fusion Asian items such as Japanese fried chicken, Korean bulgogi, and Chinese pork belly.  We tasted the fish bao and the Japanese fried chicken bao. The bao were steamed nicely and very soft.  The fried fish and Japanese chicken were fried perfectly and it is an interesting fusion to the traditional Chinese bao. There were veggie such as lettuce and tomato to complement the meat items   Beside buns, we also tasted their fries and poutine. We were especially impressed by their octopus poutine as this is something we have never tasted before. They are also famous for their kimchi fries.  Overall we enjoyed this place and were impressed by their willing to try different fusion items. Recommend all Richmond Hill workers to come here to try for lunch!"}
{"text":"My husband and I arrived and ordered at 12:17pm and we didn't get the food until 12:50pm. We could've gone somewhere had lunch and be back for the food to arrive.  We ordered the fish Bao, pork belly Bao, beef brisket Bao and bulgogi kimchi fries.  Fish Bao - decent, less bland compared to others  Pork Belly Bao - bland and the pork had an awful taste like a bad cut or about to go rancid.  Beef Brisket Bao - bland and chewy  Bulgogi Kimchi Fries - by far the best dish to order, crispy fries with a good balance of bulgogi, kimchi and sauce.  The reason I gave it one star aside from the poor tasting food, it's the fact we waited for so long and yet there was no thank you for waiting offered from the lady at the cash. She just handed me the food without a smile.  I should've said what my husband suggested, \"it's a Bao time\" when we picked up the food after 40mins wait. The name is bang on!"}
{"text":"The grilled chicken bao, is piri piri chicken (2 small pieces, imagine 2 slices of chicken breast) topped with pickled daikon and carrots, fresh cilantro and cucumber stuffed in a steamed bun.  There was some sort of spicy sauce, probably a siracha mayo.  Portion was extremely small.  The steam bun was a bit smaller than my palm.  I don't have big hands.  My biggest problem with my order was that the chicken was room temperature, and the bao was COLD.  They couldn't have warmed it up? The hubby's Korean beef bulgogi banh mi was equally disappointing.  There was barely any beef bulgogi in the sandwich.  The picture is super misleading, there was a lot of filler in the bun, pickled daikon and carrot, cucumber etc.  The bulgogi sauce was also too salty.  The bun itself was also cold, and didn't have that outer crust crunch.  Day old bread?  What makes a good banh mi is the crispy outer crust of the bun.  They could have at least attempted to hide the fact they were using day old bread by warming it up or toasting it. The worst dish was the taro fries.  Not only were these fries covered in too much five spice powder (to the point where I was using the cardboard box edge to scrape off the excess powder), the fries were DRY.  Crunchy outside, hollow inside.  Imagine eating a cross between hickory sticks and those veggie straws."}
{"text":"Very little sauce , no water served, no music or TV , open hours is short. Except the fires, napkins are very rough!!!  Will not come back again."}
{"text":"Finally a place to get baos uptown. The menu was appealing but there was nothing that stood out. The prices were definitely on the higher side, possibly more expensive than downtown. Ordered three baos and the taro chips. Sad to say, everything was disappointing. Was expecting a warm, soft and light bun but instead the bao was wrapped in a checkered parchment paper, which made the bao kind of soggy.  The only good thing was the pork belly, it was a full slice of fatty pork. The other baos only had a bit of meat and was covered in sauce. The slaw on top for all three was the same, some cabbage, carrots, radish and cilantro. It was all wrapped up tightly in paper so it was a messy eat to unwrap. The slaw was falling out and the sauce everywhere on the paper.  Overall, will not comeback here for anything here. There will need to be huge improvements for this place to be considered again."}
{"text":"I stopped by for lunch one weekday and only ordered a pork belly bao to try. The place itself wasn't packed and you order at the counter and wait for your number to be called to pick up your own food. I wasn't expecting much since I've been to more popular bao places in Toronto. The pork belly itself was cooked properly but the overall toppings combined together were a miss. I would go back to try a banh mi if I'm around the area but I'll stay clear of the baos."}
{"text":"I went into this store with no expectations based on the previous reviews. When this place first opened up, my coworkers and I were really excited to try it because I've had such a great experience at Bahn Mi Boys. However, it was just not on the same tier. There is really no flavouring or seasoning in their dishes/baos. Also, the pork belly that was served was extremely greasy. I understand that pork belly is oily to begin with, but the oil was dripping down my hands and I could taste the greasiness soaked into the dough. Overall, it was still eatable but I did not enjoy a bit of it."}
{"text":"Excellent gourmet fast food stop for those in Markham. Baos are flavourful and in good portions. The bulgogi fries are cripsy and the sauce complements the dish well. Will definitely come back again for more!"}
{"text":"I love the bulgogi fries here. Before this place I had only had banh mi and bao at Banh Mi Boys so I was pretty biased. My boyfriend loves this place especially since we live in York Region this is much easier to get to."}
