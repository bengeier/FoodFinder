{"text":"Very modern and cool atmosphere. It's basically a burger bar with lots of small plates to share. The service was very attentive, drinks were good, burgers were solid.   Old fashioned cocktails - A Charcuterie - B Poutine - B Lobster burger - A Bison burger - B+"}
{"text":"Our last night in Montreal and due to other plans couldn't get out to dinner until 10:30. Stopped in 155 For our last Montreal meal and unfortunately the kitchen was closed for the night. The owner, Raphael, walks up, hears its our last night, reopens the kitchen and we had the best burgers we've ever had. Seriously. If you're a burger fan, try the one with Maple caramelized pork belly, Aoli, and cheese curds. It's amazing as is the homemade Ketchup which is definitely one of a kind. Burger fans - this should be your first stop. Plenty of other interesting menu items as well. This will be the first place we visit next time we're in town."}
{"text":"This new place is AMAZING! Great lunch menu for only $16. You get a choice of soup (delicious butternut squash) or a house salad (super fresh), and then one of 5 or 6 entrees. My boyfriend and I got the burger and it was incredible. Served with homemade curly fries and homemade ketchup...a family recipe! The  owner is incredibly friendly, and clearly cares about the quality of food. The decor is unique and gorgeous. We are looking forward to grabbing a cocktail there later."}
{"text":"Came with Restomania's lobster festival deal - $15 for a lobster crepe (very good) and a white wine. They also have 5a7 on weekdays so you can get a slider trio (3 mini burgers, juicy) or wine for $5. Food all came in bigger portions than expected, though taste was so so. Overall nothing very special and not much variety to select from. Service was great which helped the score reach 4."}
{"text":"Very cool spot ! The Brussels sprouts with blue cheese sauce was bomb! The burger was also very good and tasty. The cocktails were tasty and well balanced! Also the fruit platter drizzled with special home made syrup is a great touch after the meal. Will come back!"}
{"text":"3 1/2 étoiles  Découvert dans le cadre du Passeport La Tablée (forfait sur Tuango). Arancinni: Ok. Copieux pour une entrée. Burger: Excellent. Bien garni.  Gnocchi: Manque de finition. Des pâtes \"pitchés\" dans une assiette. Goût rien à dire...mais on mange aussi avec les yeux... Bière maison: bonne, fait la job.  Ambiance: 0. Nous étions 2 couples.... Dessert: Trop! Bon mais portion trop généreuse...fondant au chocolat."}
{"text":"We came on a Wednesday night and it was very quiet. It's a shame because this is a great restaurant. We decided to try the restaurant after one of our friends raved about the food here (especially the gnocchi). We shared the arugula salade which was excellent, followed by the tofu burger and the pork belly burgers which were also excellent. The service was very good and the staff very friendly. We'll definitely be back here!"}
{"text":"We were a group of 7 having a birthday party at this place and it was awsome. The restaurant is very nice, food was great. Most of us tried the beef burger with popcorn shrimps and it was sooo delicous. The staff were kind and friendly."}
{"text":"This place could really use a terrace! I tried the maple pork belly burger . It was very good n very juicy! I was afraid it would be sweet because of the maple but it wasn't. It came wit curly fries... like the frozen McCain ones! Some people might not like that but it reminded me of high school. The brussel sprouts come with cheese on top and my friend is lactose intolerant so sadly we could not order it but it was highly recommended by the waiter. This restaurant is really cute. It was a bit dead inside but I guess that's expected from a fairly new restaurant."}
