{"text":"I wouldn't even give this bar 1 star.  went here today for lunch and had the Worst, vile and rudest bartender I've ever encountered in 7 years of living here. Fire her for her attitude and awful profanity laced mouth to paying customers. Can't wait to yelp the situation, call her name out and tell all of my friends and family NOT to ever come here again. I'm highly disappointed and appalled at her general lack of respect.  Employees come and employees go. Again, fire her ...she's a complete embarrassment to your entire establishment.  The two hours I was there she must have taken at least 4 shots!"}
{"text":"I went here with a friend for drinks. It was a nice atmosphere and a great bartender. This was a nice local bar with affordable drinks. They have a great guy who plays music on Fridays. It was not crowded, not to loud with really nice people."}
{"text":"This place is in close proximity of my house so it's nice to be able to walk over and have a beer. But this places has sub-par food that is way over priced for the quality & what you get. The bartenders are a bit preoccupied with their friends or regulars that the rest of us have to wait up to 40 minutes for another drink. The management and/or owner really needs to evaluate their staff and food if they want to stay in business! Hate to see it go but it will things don't change."}
{"text":"Walked in to get some brunch. While we were ordering, our waitress was clueless with the menu (she said she was new). Didn't even know of any lunch specials. We ordered our food and about 5-10 minutes later, she came back to inform us that their fryer wasn't working. In my opinion, I think she should have informed us this prior to ordering. She definitely said a lot of \"ionnos.\" My whole party left and we ended up going to a Hawaiian BBQ establishment instead."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  Four of us went for lunch and liked it so much we came back for breakfast.  Wedge salad, chili, soups, biscuits and gravy, breakfast burrito...all very good.  No complaints.  Fresh and original."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this new place, used to be a Timber's. The menu was a little pricey for a gaming tavern - restaurant. We ordered a French dip and a Reuben, both with the cheese tots. The sandwiches were a bit \"dry\" and not that great. Arby's makes a much better French dip and Reuben, and for half the price. The cheese things weren't bad, basically deep fried Mac n cheese, but you can tell they were frozen. We each ordered a beer and the total bill was ~$40. I think if you are going to have $12-$15 sandwiches and burgers and $30 steaks, you need to up the quality. The food we had would have been acceptable if the meal was less than $10."}
{"text":"This place generally has very good food. I live in the area, and it needs more restaurants in a bad way. This is a good option for most. I and my family have been there multiple times in the last month, and most of the stuff has been good to great. 

Quick break down: 
Breakfast: B & G is very good (good gravy w/sausage & bacon), bacon is good but not great, pumpkin cheesecake pancakes (on the brunch menu) are delicious, pancakes are very good, breakfast burrito very good.

Lunch: Try the seafood bisque. It is not a bisque as I would define it b/c it has big chunks of seafood (which is not a bad thing). It is delicious and is served with a nice puff pastry with sour cream and caviar, a nice touch. I had a nice sandwhich called a Pepperstrami (sourdough bread, pastrami, pepperoni, swiss, coleslaw) that was very good.  The chili is satisfying and hearty.

OK, the burgers: they are pretty good, I don't think the beef is frozen (which is a must), cooked right, had a good wood fired beefy taste. But I am kind of a burger snob, and for the same price you can get a killer burger at Bachi Burger or Honey Salt. But this place is closer to my house (by a lot) so I might get another. I'm not saying they are bad, just not as good as the best.

I always get good service here. For the area, it is a good option. The only other bar in the area is PT's, which is total crap and just as expensive.  On that note, i will agree with many other reviewers that the menu is expensive, but if I don't want to spend the $, I don't go there. If I want a cheap lunch, I usually go to Roberto's Tacos across the street, or KFC or something.  I just wonder what they are comparing Millside to? Most places me & my wife go to eat lunch (non fast food) is 30 to 40 bucks. I mean, Eat, Chilis, Du-pars, Hash House, Omlette House, Blueberry Hill, Applebees, Famous Daves, Viva Zapatas, all are at least $25. I'm not saying Millside compares with all of the above, I'm just saying.  Try it out."}
{"text":"This was the worst bar I've ever gone to. I walked in and sat down, wasn't acknowledged for a while. I guess it was because the two female bartenders were busy eating chicken wings with the customers. It took at least 20 minutes to get my second drink order because they disappeared in the back. I would never come here again."}
{"text":"You know how every corner in Vegas has a gambling and bar place that sells food. Well this is the best damn gambling and bar place that sells food in all of Las Vegas ya all. 
Millside is a North Las Vegas exciting establishment for all. Family seating is available. Bar top gambling with great odds. The food is amazing. 
If my grand parents were still alive I'd take them. Five stars from me and the entire family. 

Check them out. 
I absolutely endorse and approve this message.

{"text":"I will tell you, I normally dont ever complain about local bars being that I have been a local bartender for many years, but I walked in pulled a 100 bucks out of the ATM and headed for the bar. Sadly the two bartenders were too busy to even acknowledge me or even greet me with a hello, they just looked at me and continued wrapping gifts behind the bar. I guess this is how they treat their gamers, so I literally waited 10 minutes and still no one asked if would like something, so I left. I hope management reads these complaints, because this service is completely unacceptable.."}
{"text":"What a disappointment. I have lived in the area for a few years now I was hoping to get a new bar/restaurant that would price itself for the neighborhood. Sadly, the prices for food are so high, and the return for your dollar so low it is just not worth going there no matter how good the food is, and it wasn't (that good). I do not foresee a long run of business for these people here.

Walking in was like walking into a dungeon, very dark and honestly you could trip over things. Since this was formerly a Timbers, the d√©cor was that \"North Western\" hack you expect from a Timbers, nothing interesting. The bar had  the requisite Video Poker games and what looked to be a shallow well. The Spirits list included some very pricey bottles (including Dom at $400) that I would suppose would never sell in this neighborhood. The wines were an eclectic list and priced rather high, so not sure who they buy from but it is off beat. As for beers, well, I worked at a bar that had 700 different beers and was not impressed. I think the Smiths Ale was the only eye raiser. Also in there list was a subsection \"cans\", I have never seen this even though it is common for British Cream Ales and such to come in cans, it's not mentioned. So the bar area, nothing special and a bit eerie, but that's my opinion.

As for the restaurant, the prices were too high, period. The claim made by the waiter (this had to have been his first service job) that all the food was fresh made was a complete lie. The food was Sysco re-heat and eat restaurant selections without a doubt. Of the burger dinner I did have, MAYBE the patty was hand formed and 1/3 pound. It came with sweet potato fries (undercooked) and fried pickle chips on the burger (so they  were soggy), and the bacon tasted reheated by dropping it in the fryer for  a few seconds. This was $14.

My wife wanted Linguini Alfredo and it came with garlic bread. This also was $14. Yeah, that's all, pasta (not fresh), Alfredo Sauce (if that was made fresh then there is something seriously wrong with the cook) and of course they weren't about to bake bread. But are we missing something? Where is the protein? This did not come with a protein, they want you to pay extra for a protein or even some vegetables. $14 for a plate of carbs... and worse, they didn't really have any. Was there a fish offering? No. How about adding chicken to that Alfredo? Nope. Shrimp? What's that? And this was the same for the red sauce, (no bolognaise  from what I could see).

Well, won't be back unless management changes again."}
{"text":"WAY OVER PRICED for Sysco food.  Drinks are good, appitizers were also good.  WIfe got a RAW pork sandwich.  They took it back and made it right but still.  My chili tasted like it came from a can.  We came back a second time.  Fried pickles are really good.  Blood Marys are excellent.  Burger for the wife looked a little undercooked for her liking but the room is dark and she didn't taste blood.  Will go back for drinks and test other menu items.  Hopefully it will increase.  

One last thing, their \"wood fired grill\" doesn't impart a smoked flavor in the food items."}
{"text":"great service, but how can y'all not know how to make a Colorado omelet? I would rather come and drink at this place, but they have both a party area and family area"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite bars in Vegas. Every time I've been in here the bar staff is friendly and attentive. The prices are very good and everything I've eaten here is delicious. There is a good selection of beer but not so many it's overwhelming, and the staff is very knowledgeable about what they do have on tap. There's a restaurant side of you don't want to deal with the smoke and gaming, the bar side also has some very nice lounge type chairs. Comfy, friendly, and reasonable prices. Win win win."}
{"text":"My husband and I are new to the area. We decided to take a drive around. We came across this place. From the outside it's not much to look it but as we entered it was more than expected. The place was a lot bigger and the decor was nice. We decided to sit on the bar side. They have a restaurant part if you choose a smokeless dining experience. Our server came right up and quickly took our drink order. The prices were a little on the high side for a Bar/gambling establishment. But the food was amazing and the portions were just right. Our server came back several times to see if we needed anything else...AKA Beer! I would definitely recommend this place to eat or just sit back and chill."}
{"text":"Hands down the worst local bar I've ever been to in the valley. Really sad because it's close to work. Service was no stars."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time with friends on a recommendation of the food. It was right on! The food was amazing and thw service was incredible as well. I would highly recommend this place to my friends!"}
{"text":"Ladies and gentlemen, would you like an out of this world taco experience?  One of which you have never experienced? Please, i beg of you to listen, PLEASE go to Millside and try the monthly special of \"Crispy Asian Taco\" my mind and taste buds alike are completely BLOWN away with this dish! It has the most perfect blend of the far east explosion of taste, with the perfectly fried shell of our friends to the south to withhold the goodness! Again Trahill the master chef as delivered something I haven't experienced at ANY 5 star resturant on the Las Vegas strip. The taste was multicultural and the purportions were above adique.  This dish is bucket-list worthy! I now know to come hungry and sit here and try all this gentleman's specials because I know I will not be disappointed with this young man, diamond in the rough.  I believe Trahill works dinner hours so this is the perfect time to visit.  I only have one requeat from Millside, let this gentleman hand deliver his plates/masterpieces to the customer so we can appraise him! 6/5 stars in the kitchen, absolutely amazing chef."}
{"text":"Large portions to satisfy any belly size. Good service too"}
{"text":"It's an okay start, but in this area this restaurant may fail due to pricing. 

I stopped in for lunch with a coworker. The staff were warm and greeting and hyped the quality of their food prior to ordering. 

I got a BLT plus Avocado and my friend a chicken Caesar salad. With one fountain drink added in the bill was just shy of $30 before tip. That is decent, a bit pricey, but now consider that this was a weekday lunch, that means I'll be going elsewhere. 

The food wasn't bad, but it didn't best other lunch options for sitdown restaurants, especially for what we paid. 

On a note, there is no way my coworkers salad was worth $13.99!!!

My suggestion would to add a lunch menu with paired down portions at a reasonable price and value. Maybe try a $6.99 or $7.99 lunch special otherwise I don't see business picking up anytime soon. 

It's really a shame, but I hope to update the review on this place later once some kinks in their menu are worked out."}
{"text":"This place is right down the street and my husband and I decided to go in there for lunch yesterday. We were excited to have a place to hang out at right down the street. 

Well we were greeted by a server who looked like she just crawled out of bed ans threw her hair in a pony tail. We chose a small table since there were only 2 of us. She quickly asked us to sit at a bigger table because it was hard to eat at the small table. Her voice was annoying and she seemed fake. 

We moved tables and ordered a burger and a breakfast burrito. The burger was $14 and the burrito was $12. They were mediocre and not worth the money. I can get a burger at Farmer Boy that's better and cheaper. 

The place is too expensive and it seems boring. The bartender was mostly bsing with the customers and wearing a tank top with her bra hanging out, which I think is trashy. 

We decided we won't go back there."}
{"text":"So I had about 2 hours to spare and found this spot and let me tell you.... From the second my daughter and I walked in we were greeted with wonderful service from Andrea. She recommended the food for me which was their 2 egg basic and it was delicious and the the jalape√±o bacon was bomb!!! My daughter said we should bring her brother and sister back to eat here."}
{"text":"From reading other post I would not have come in, but I'm glad we did. I have been a server for over 20 years and after eating here and reading some of the other post I would say the ones that were to the extreme of negative are just people who are not happy in general. Yes the food is a bit pricing but worth it. Anyone with class knows you get why you pay for. The staff was very professional and genuine and I will returning, full bar with great choices same as menu. Great little hang out. I hope it sticks around!!!"}
{"text":"Went in today. The lady behind the bar greeted my wife, 2 kids, and myself. After picking a booth in the back we waited for 15 minutes and never seen anyone.  My wife walked up to the bar and the 2 lady's there ignored her, so we left. We will not be back!"}
{"text":"Here they have a variety of good beers. Nice , clean looking atmosphere. However their food is mediocre and overpriced. I will come back to drink here but not to eat."}
{"text":"There is a bar side and a restaurant side. We sat on the restaurant side because I didn't like the cigarette smoke on the bar side. 
The server was EXCELLENT! She was so good, we didn't even realize she got one of our orders wrongs. That's OK, since we didn't even notice it until we were talking about it later at home. 
We ordered the buffalo wings for starters. There were exactly 10 wings on the plate and not sure if it was actually 2lbs like the menu said. But still it was pretty good! 
My partner ordered the Chicken Burger but got the Turkey Club instead. It was actually pretty good. Not sure why we didn't notice until later. The Turkey Club was a large portion, so you will not leave the table unsatisfied. He ordered cheesy tator tots (tator tots with cheese inside). They were good too, but nothing spectacular.
I ordered the Double Dare. Grilled cheese sandwiches used as a bun for 1lb of hamburger with 4 slices of applewood bacon and fried egg. The burger meat itself was kind of bland, but maybe it was designed that way because it combined all the flavors very well in your mouth. 
The french fries was OK, but their ranch dressing was excellent! Not sure if it was homemade or what not, but it was pretty good!  All in all we had an EXCELLENT experience. Good food, kinda on the up side on cost, but worth it, especially when it comes with GREAT SERVICE!"}
{"text":"Staff is so awesome food is fantastic just wish they had better steak and eggs option. But their fries are so good its like they are fried in unicorn tears"}
{"text":"What a great place!! Food is great Brandi was our bar tender. We never waited for anything. Would go back many times"}
{"text":"Disgusting! 

First- $9 for biscuits and gravy seems a little high, but when it looks greasy and the gravy is broken, you can't even eat it! 

2lbs of chicken wings? NOPE. 9 tiny ass pieces! Even weighed it, didn't register on the scale! 

$4 for fries? Ok, except the amount was ridiculously small... 

I've uploaded pictures of it all. Called to speak to a manger (this was a to-go order) and there was no one there to talk to! 

I wouldn't have given it a star except it requires it to write a post. 

Disappointed. Glad I have a frozen pizza at home."}
{"text":"What a little gem this placed turned out to be! Its kinda dark inside but the staff is very friendly and the food is yummy! They have a nice beer list as well. The wings and nachos ate a must order! Big portions for a good price!"}
{"text":"We go here once a month, their breakfast is very limited, and a bit pricey, but the two egg breakfast is plenty off food for $7. I wanted to order the \"build your own omelet\", but it is $9, and each topping is $1 extra. Usually restaurants will give you two items included, but not here. Their dinner menu is good, I really recommend their calzones, and pizza. its a nice atmosphere, comfy chairs, and I like their music they play, but they have a very limited beer selection. Today.. After ordering a diet coke, I tasted one sip, and it tasted like MOLD! It must be the soda gun. It tasted like it had not been properly cleaned. Stick to the drinks that don't need soda!"}
{"text":"We had Julia as a server and she was wonderful.  Wish the prices were lower but the food was good enough that we will return."}
{"text":"This place has the best customer service for a local bar and always has. Tonight I came in because I didn't want fast food and it was late and the smell of smoked food was strong.  Walked in and sat at bar, three others around bar and no one  at tables. Pretty sad on a Saturday night at 9, early for the party crowd but not for a local bar like this. 
Every time we've talked ourselves in to giving this place a try we've never been disappointed with the appetizers but that was about it.  I've had some bad experiences in here a raw pork tenderloin sandwich the first time kinda bad. There beer selection when they hubby is here and the cheesy tots are always good and again the staff are always friendly and happy to accommodate any requests. 
Tonight they presented me with a late hour menu that had two things that jumped out at me, mashed potato bowl you got it peeps taters, fried chicken, corn, cheese and gravy I WILL be back to try this ! And some crispy Asian tacos, since I've been craving some from the bee of the Apple place these were what I went for. (After the fried pickles, I mean I can't resist them anywhere I go. Here they have a good light fluffy encompassing batter that sticks to pickles well- ranch is pretty good for not homemade) back to the tacos.....they are pretty good. Slaw not the best I've ever had for sure, but hard to keep good seasoned slaw around for long before it looses it crunch, chicken had ok flavor but seemed to taste of vinegar and no that's not the type of slaw it was. Good enough to give this place overall 3 stars maybe that tater bowl next time will continue to make steps to a solid bar and GRILL type place....I hope so, I hope they continue to redeem themselves."}
{"text":"After two more recent visits Millside has earned another half a star overall.  In these meals, Potstickers were a solid and very good starter each time.  On the first occasion, a Chicken & Avocado Sandwich with chunks of moist white meat chicken, Muenster Cheese, Daikon Sprouts, tomato slices, mayonnaise, Red Onion, Applewood Bacon, and avocado was moist and delectable accompanied by scrumptious Cheesy Tater Tots.  On the second, a BBLTA with Avocado on Sourdough Bread featured twice as much thick Applewood Bacon as one might expect to find on a BLT Sandwich, and was very tasty.  

A bowl of Cream of Mushroom Soup tasted very good but salty.  And, Sweet Potato Fries were simply excellent.  In one case it took a great deal of time to receive ordered dishes even though our party of six was the only group dining at the time.  But, while cooking in the kitchen was slow, all the food that came out of it was very good.   

* * * * overall on these two days of dining"}
{"text":"CeCe is amazing. Took care of me during a nice college football Saturday. The burger is amazing as well. I've never had food here that wasn't on point. Way better than PT's or sierra gold."}
{"text":"Had their fried pickles once and decided that I needed to come back for a full meal. Convinced my boyfriend to go, and he ordered the club sandwich and I ordered the build your own pasta.

He got his club, that had onion on it, and the menu didn't list it as an ingredient. 

I got my pasta that was $13.99, and since the menu said to add additional items, $1.00 each, I added mushroom and chicken. Got my penne with Alfredo, and my extra items. And scallions (which also wasn't on the menu, and I had to pick off.) 

My boyfriend said his sandwich was \"ok\". The pasta sauce was watery and had a weird taste. 

Imagine our surprise when we got the bill and my pasta was $18.99. When we asked the waitress, we were told, \"We just changed our menu and there are some errors on it.\" So we were stuck with a higher bill because they had typos. Wouldn't have minded paying if the food was actually worth $18.99. I can get the same dish elsewhere for half the cost (and I will from now on.) 

We won't be coming back to eat, but I do have to give two stars for those fried pickles. Only reason we would go back."}
