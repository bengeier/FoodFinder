{"text":"Probably the worst service experience ever! My friend's wife ordered a glass of wine which had a fly in it. We told the waitress and she came back saying that her manager said, \"we won't be able to give you a new glass/drink, but we can take the fly out for you...\" Can't believe this response! Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite spots in the city. The food is really good, as well as the drinking menu. If a merge in between a restaurant and a cool bar."}
{"text":"Had been planning to check it out for a while... Tonight: Great vibe. Great environment. Reasonable alcohol prices. My server: Fantastically friendly and helpful server tonight - the type that deserves a tip, and you're happy to attribute one to her (not like those servers who militantly expect a tip for performing the basic function of their job description - at other places allllll over Toronto. Hate those types). I'd return to Trinity Common; for sure!"}
{"text":"I love trinity common, a really nice local spot with amazing customer service and GREAT beer."}
{"text":"Pretty decent patio especially on a weekend and they do a caesar/mimosa special that's pretty standard. I'm surprised that it's not more crowded. The place is also great to catch a game with the huge screens.   I'm a big fan of shishito peppers and this is one of the few places that I've seen it on the menu and they don't charge you some absurd amount for it. However, the roasted sweet potatoes left something to be desired.. it tasted like it had been microwaved."}
{"text":"The cevice tacos are enough to keep returning to this place. Only complaint is that its slow to move volume in and out, but very good food and beer available."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the worst food I have ever had. Ordered wings that had every last bit of moisture removed leaving a cardboard texture, and although were was a little sauce, tasted of cardboard too. The beans were a mixture of under cooked and over cooked beans in a sauce that seemed reheated a few too many times.   The fries were good.  Service: Not so great. It was busy but, it's Kennsington Market on a long weekend, it should be expected."}
{"text":"This is a review of the time we didn't get in.   We wanted to check it out a couple of weeks ago but were saddened to learn that the whole bar was closed for a private event.  They even had a little sign drawn that said 'closed for Jay-Z'.  The bouncer was friendly enough but I couldn't sweet talk my way in.    Nevertheless, I'm posting this review to find out if JAY-Z was really there (this was during NXNE).  I'm guessing no but then who was there?!"}
{"text":"Excellent selection of beers and great patio in the heart of Kensington Market. Haven't tried the food but menu looked great."}
{"text":"Came by for a quick afternoon bite around 1. Seemed to be serving the brunch menu, which was pretty diverse.   Had the chicken and waffles. Chicken was to die for. Waffles were...waffles. Burned at that. In any case, would still have the dish again!  Would have earned that fourth star had service been better. The hostess seemed bothered by us. We tried to sit at a picnic table but she cleaned it without drying it.   Despite the service hiccup, would recommend trying it!"}
{"text":"Craft beers list is beyond impressive.  The avocado salad with greens, cherry tomatoes, and smoked blue potatoes was phenomenal and unique.  Good  burgers. Good ribs. Really good sweet potato fries, grilled shishito peppers, and regular fries.  They had a daily special appetizer: breaded shrimp that we didn't order, but the folks at the table next to ours were raving about.  Wish we had ordered this as well.  My only suggestion:  make the red cabbage slaw more interesting.  And if all of the great food wasn't enough, they also have live music on Sunday evenings and DJs on Fridays -- plus a real neighborhood (Kensington Market) right outside the door.  Definitely belongs in the \"best of real Toronto and affordable\" lists."}
{"text":"I have been sitting here for an hour waiting for my food. I am starving and still waiting. The waitress actually had the nerve to ask me if I wanted another drink cause I finished mine while this excruciatingly long wait for my brunch - should totally be offering me free drinks during this ridiculous wait"}
{"text":"Didn't get service here for an hour for a table of two people. Made eye contact and tried to wave down staff, they said they'd be back. They never came back. Instead they decided to tend to two tables that came in 40 minutes after we did, I assume because there were more patrons so they would make more money on tips, I don't know.   Warm oysters that made me ill and overpriced double bar rail.   Will not be coming back here, too bad it seemed like a nice place."}
{"text":"Fantastic beer selection on tap, but food selection was so-so.  We started w a dozen of the buck-a-shuck oysters - and they only serve one type (kushi?) which was good but I would have wanted some variety.  For entrees, my boyfriend ordered the buttermilk chicken on waffles w/ syrup - which was very yummy!  I had the \"can't believe it's not veal\" vegetarian sandwich and while it was good, it didn't come with any sides.  I just felt like something was missing!  They also didn't have any poutine today when we visited, so that was disappointing.  Atmosphere is pretty good, but was kind of empty.  And I also didn't like how our server was kind of clueless.  I asked him what the special was today and he straight up told me \"I actually don't know\".  Um...right.  So am I supposed to tell you or something?  Anyway - it's ok but not memorable.  Would rather check out other spots in the area."}
{"text":"I thought the service was great I really enjoyed my time here! I love the open space that they have great for a good group of people! Food price wasn't that much !!"}
{"text":"Great food, nice tap selection including cider. Spacious seating good for a group, which is especially nice in Kensington!"}
{"text":"**DO NOT EVEN BOTHER WITH THIS PLACE**  Food quality and service are outrageously poor. I've never left a restaurant angry and feeling ripped off before.  Food came 1 hr later. Tables that ordered after us were served. When I asked the server (Kayla), all she told us was that she checked on our order.  When the food came out, it was cold and barely edible. The guest I came with didn't bother eat to eat most of it but had to eat something as it was already very late. We also didn't want to send any food back as (1) we didn't want to wait another hour and (2)we had to be elsewhere.  When I told Kayla the food was cold and poorly cooked, she just apologized. Didn't offer to bring anything new to replace. She only offered us a drink. A drink isn't going to make my hunger go away!  Kayla should have brought a manager over to talk to us as the food being super late, cold, and barely edible is all unacceptable.   I'll never go back there ever again.   This is one of my worst dining experiences."}
{"text":"I feel really torn about this place. On the one hand, they have a great selection of craft beers, reasonably priced. On the other hand, the wait times to be seated can be ridiculous. And if you get a table in the evening, you may find yourself questioning whether it was worth the wait, with the music playing full volume and making it impossible to hear any company. I was sitting across from my date and we ended up having to shout at one another the entire evening. Probably better to check out during the summer when you can take advantage of the patio (though it's tight seating)."}
{"text":"Excellent food, drinks, and service.  Whenever I am thinking where to go for a drink on a patio with some delicious snacks, trinity commons is usually the first place on my mind (and if its not I kick myself for wasting time yelping when I inevitably end up here).  I have never had a bad experience, bad cocktail, or a bad plate of food. The fries, mushrooms, sausage... just all delicious.   This is my go to place and now that the weather is warming up, my ass will be a permanent fixture on that patio"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for the first time because they were one of the only spots around that were playing the sports games. It was super busy and we got a seat at a high top table that has communal style seating. Our waitress was super friendly and knowledgeable about the cool craft beer selection. She was able to help me choose something that I really enjoyed. We both were super excited over the French fries here.... definitely something unusual to love but we were obsessed. We did notice that our server disappeared without notice and we were followed up with an equally nice, but extremely busy male server. We ended up just leaving after the one drink and food as the service was just too slow. Until that point, everything was awesome and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is super funky and has a great selection of beers. We did not eat here but had drinks here two night. If you are looking for a funky place to have beers and hang out this is your place."}
{"text":"New bar in Kensington Market and I really like it. 3 visits so far and enjoyed each visit. If your a craft beer fan in Toronto... This is a must stop.  It's always about the beer and trinity Commons have 20 beers on tap. Always a good mix of beers primarily Ontario based but a few other surprises. Something for everyone.  The space is huge and open with a good size patio. Very comfortable in here... Easy to enjoy a good beer. The front windows fully open up, letting a cool breeze blow through and making the space feel even more open. Tables inside are communal - kind of like big picnic tables connected together. You can find me at the decent sized bar ( about 12 - 15 seats).   Food is traditional BBQ and I was a little disappointed here. They ran out of most menu items by 9:30pm but I will give some slack as they are new. I was forced to have the drumsticks as this was the only item left (I don't even like drumsticks) and they were very spicy.... Too spicy for me.   I think this place could turn into something special. I love drinking here, great craft beers in a non- crowded space (a rarity in Toronto). The size of Trinity is their competitive advantage - no getting bumped into, no large wait times and great atmosphere. You can't go wrong.   P.S: Bar Hop regulars will feel at home here. Some staff members have switched permanently and others do double duty. Many Barhop regulars visit as well (myself included).  BK"}
{"text":"This place is great! We came here for brunch. Their portions are huge and delicious. I got the Benny with avocado and side strip bacon. We came here really early, probably the 1st people to arrive there. The service was quick and prompt."}
{"text":"Do you ever find yourself wandering around Kensington market? If so, wander yourself here.   Magical wings - if Harry Potter had babies, these wings would be them.   Trinity burger - melts in your mouth   Fried chicken and waffles is 100% better than your mamas (no offense to your mama)  Craft beer selection is extensive and delicious, ranging from fruity brews to dark coffee chocolatey goodness.   10/10 would smash"}
{"text":"I came here late on a Saturday night and was pretty happy to find a place with the following: 1. Good beer selection 2. Food until midnight (I think?) 3. No cover charge (but no live music either)  Its a pretty cool place to hang out and catch up with people as most of the bars in the Kensington market area are smaller/darker/louder than Trinity Common. There's no cover charge but there are lots of bars in the area that have live music.  When I went, the crowd was pretty much all college aged. This may or may not be your thing if you are bar hopping in this area."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this place. I keep going back there time and again, and the place is always packed.  Why? Because their service is great, the selection of craft beers is terrific, and the atmosphere is relaxed/casual and chic at the same time.  They now have live music on Sunday evenings.  Must haves: the Old-Fashioned cocktail, Breakfast Caeser, Kennsington Burger and Trinity Burger.  The menu items may be a bit pricey for a lot of people but quality is worth it."}
{"text":"Another Kensington gem. I loved the vibe and laid-back type atmosphere of this bar-pub. Due to my severe reaction to alcohol, I do not always enjoy myself in a pub type setting, however, I could see the appeal of this place. Staff were very friendly and take time to make their recommendations and make quick banters. There are a wide variety of draft and craft beers that are available for your pickings. The music varies from live DJs to a breezy playlist.  The food was what hooked me. During the summer, especially, the ceviche taco just brings out all that summertime freshness. The bouquet of flavours were very well balanced with the citrus, savoury and sweetness of the seafood. I loved there house hot sauce displayed in a cute miniature bottle that packed a punch. I was obsessively lathering all my food with it...I was so tempted to grab a bottle and run off with it (but don't worry, I kept my dignity partially intact and left the bottle with its rightful owner). $1 oysters were a nice treat, though they were quite small but fresh...pretty typical.  As 2 birds with one stone type deal...they offered Wanda's Pie in the sky as their featured desserts that day. I LOVED the peanut butter cheese cake-and I'm not even a peanut butter, chocolate nor heavy creamed cake fan! OMG, it was not in your face sweet but instead the texture and taste were on point....drooolssss. The best part of this collaboration is that I could get desserts late in the night.   Overall, lovely place that have a little of everything for everyone. Great vibe, decent food and happy company. I would love to come back, time and time again, when in the area."}
{"text":"Nice casual place in Kensington market.   -I tried some of their beers and other drinks which were decent. -Price for drinks is average, some items a little more expensive. -Food is a bit pricey overall, there are some items that are more worth your money than others in terms of flavour and portions.  -I was interested in trying their ceviche taco, but when the waitress described to me that it's two small tacos for $12, I found that to be a bit much. -I had their beef brisket burger with sweet potatoes and collard greens on the side which was DELICIOUS. There was so much flavour in the meat and the vegetables. Portion was more than enough; I saved some for dinner.  -Tried their chicken and waffles as well. It had a chipotle maple syrup, but really all I tasted was maple syrup, which was very rich. The flavour of the syrup almost masked the seasoning and flavour of the buttermilk fried chicken. I also didn't think the dish itself was balanced enough. Could've used a side and maybe a chipotle maple syrup that actually has spice in it. Portion was good.  -My friend had their chicken wings and said it was so so. 6 little chicken wings (and I mean little) with 2 sides. Meh.... -Service is a hit or miss. I've had good service and so so service. Sometimes the wait is long.  -Good for groups or date. -Atmosphere and decor are really nice, comfortable seating outside as well.  -Overall, I would say this place is a hit or miss because of the value of the plates and service could be better. From my experience, it just depends on what you order."}
{"text":"Best hamburger in Kensington. EVER. Staff are super friendly. Washrooms are super clean."}
{"text":"it was drizzling outside so we were looking for a place to grab some drinks and the fire pits outside drew us in.  strong tasty drinks.  get the buffalo cauliflower."}
{"text":"What a great place to spend a Friday night at! I had dinner and drinks here on the patio with a couple of girlfriends. A very nice and relaxing environment in Kensington Market, surrounded by hipster vibes.  Kudos to their wide beer selection! Our server recommended Beau's Lugtread for a light and traditional beer, and it tasted exactly like that. Nothing special. My friend ordered Sawdust City's Princess Wears Girls Pants, and it tasted really good! Tasted very refreshing, and smelled like lychee. I would definitely get that next time. My other friend got West Ave's Cherriosity, and we were not a fan of that cider. The drink wasn't smooth, and the cherry after-taste wasn't pleasant.   In terms of food, I was quite disappointed. I ordered the Trinity Burger with collard greens and cajun roasted sweet potatoes. The beef patties were very juicy, but the bottom part of the bun was super soggy, so it was hard to hold the burger to eat it. With the shredded lettuce and American cheese, I'm sorry to say that the burger tasted almost like a McDonald's Big Mac. The sides were good though; the greens were dressed in some combination of garlic, olive oil, and more.  My friend ordered the Chicken & Waffles, and the portion size was massive! It came with what looked like a whole chicken, and cornbread waffles. The chicken was extremely tender; I regretted not ordering this myself.  Overall, the service was good- the servers were friendly. I would come back, but only for the drinks and not food."}
{"text":"Service was great, beer selection impeccable, but easily the worst wings I've had in years. They were like eating a soggy, sauce drenched clump of cumin; over spiced and potentially undercooked. The macaroni and cheese was adequate, if underwhelming - - a solid 6."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Nice place to kill time or have dinner. I liked some items on the menu, but we chose not to stay. They even have an extension charger chord for your cell!"}
{"text":"Fantastic patio in a great people watching spot in the heart of Kensington Market. Nice selection of taps for beer. I had a sawdust city beer called Princess Wears Girl Pants (a personal favorite) and the tuna ceviche huge portion and well prepared.  Service was great friendly prompt. Really crowded patio means be prepared to have your table hovered for."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a couple of drinks with some friends on a girls night out on the patio.  Service was pretty nonchalant and slow-ish. Our server wasn't overly friendly or engaging and took a long time to check on us. We would have each ordered one more drink (maybe more!) if she had of checked in more often.  Perhaps it was because we didn't order food? Oh well who knows!  Probably wouldn't go out of my way to return here."}
{"text":"I'm sitting here and it's been twenty minutes since I ordered my meal. MEXICAN CORN should not take so long to cook. I previously ordered ceviche tacos and nowhere in the menu did it say that for $12 I would get two cold greasy tacos in a hardshell. No thanks."}
{"text":"This place used to rule, now the beer always comes out flat or it tastes off.  They also refused to serve fries because it is brunch? As the server told us this some one at a nearby table was served fries, whatever! Won't be back!"}
{"text":"Had their fries and Spicy Caesar. Fries was great! However I felt the spicy Caesar wasn't done well, all I could taste was the clomato juice."}
{"text":"Cute place in Kensington. Despite being a fan of communal tables, i found this one a bit intensely crowded. I recommend sitting by the bar.   Food was overall great. I found the beans to be too sweet, but then again i don't have a sweet tooth.  I'd go back for a pint and small sharing plates."}
{"text":"Brutal customer service.   I brought my friends last Sunday afternoon because I thought their burger was good. My friend ordered one and asked the waitress if the sauce on it had dairy because she was lactose intolerant. The waitress assured us there was no dairy and we even discussed other vegan restaurants in the neighbourhood with her. When the burger came out, there was cheese on it. My friend reminded the waitress she was lactose, and politely asked if she could get a new burger without cheese. The waitress informed us that she talked to her boss and that she could bring a new burger but we would have to pay for both.   THIS IS THE MOST BANANAS THING I'VE HEARD.   My friend is too sweet and agreed because she was hungry. Now she's stuck with two burgers, one she can never eat, and a super bad taste in her mouth from the waitress. Very obvious the waitress was new and didn't want to get in trouble with her boss so she made us foot the bill.  You can't have this type of customer service in 2016 and expect people won't put it online. You also can't last as a restaurant treating your customers this way. It would've cost you a couple bucks to fix the problem and would've saved you three customers who would've gone all summer and now won't go back and will tell our friends to do the same.   Super bummed."}
{"text":"No thanks.  Probably best for 19, 20 something (mostly hipster).  Annoyingly LOUD.  wanted to leave asap."}
{"text":"We were a table of 4- we were grossed out by some of the dishes and found the staff to be rude.  Won't be back!"}
{"text":"A little on the pricey side of things, but great service and an awesome selection of brews and liquors. And let's not forget the food...... Not a huge amount of selection,  but it all looks delicious!"}
{"text":"Good food and liquor prices, uninspired atmosphere, horrendous staff who can not handle personal turmoil and use it as an excuse to justify being absolutely dreadful the whole evening. Sort your shit out or take some time off."}
{"text":"I so wanted to like this place. I feel like there was a lot of potential when we walked in, but this was never fulfilled.   We had a party of seven, and were quickly seated inside as most people had filled up the patio. We ordered drinks, which turned up pretty fast, but service soon went downhill.   One of my friends came late. It took her so long to nab down our server to place her order. By this point, we had been waiting for at least half an hour for food. The server then informed us that \"the computers had crashed\" and the kitchen hadn't received our food orders. Thus resulted another 15-minute wait. She did bring us some fries on the house for this inconvenience, but by then the food was almost ready.   I feel like they have good food selection. You're bound to find something you like off their menu. I was feeling like some seafood, so I ordered the Creole shrimp. This was probably partially my fault for not reading the description, but this dish was literally six small shrimp. Definitely should be moved to the appetizers section. Luckily, a lot of people ordered the chicken and waffles, and I was able to satiate my hunger with a nice piece of fried chicken.   It did get busier by the time we (finally) finished our meal, but not enough to justify another 15-minute wait to pay our bills. We just wanted to get out of there by this point. With better service, I think this place could make a more worthwhile impression."}
{"text":"Very Hip space.  Great food, friendly staff and reasonably priced.   Located on Toronto's historic Kensington Market area."}
{"text":"The food, drinks and service are great.  The one thing holding this place back is that it's way too loud.  They had a dj playing best of the 80s crap at ear ringing volume.  Servers  could barely hear our order, conversation was a shouting match.  The couple next to us left because of it.  A table next to us moved and had all of their food shifted to a table near the front because they couldn't take it.  The food here is fantastic but would rather opt for take out than to return.  It's that ridiculous.  Crazy fun fact:  We went to see a metal band play across the street at Coalition after.  We both agreed that the metal show wasn't as loud as the stupid dj at dinner.  There's your reference point.  It's louder than being at a metal show.  What a shame."}
{"text":"4/5:  Think of a nicely dimmed restaurant with good food, good beers, and great atmosphere at a fair price: You get Trinity Common. I came went here for an evening date a few days ago and, based on my one experience, this is a spot with all of those points.   The food was good. Not amazing but solid good. I ordered the Cuban sandwich (which came in a bun that wasn't pressed unfortunately, but flavor was there) and my date ordered the Steak sandwich. We also ordered a plate of Tuna Ceviche to start (which came with a side of chips). The portion size for the Ceviche seemed small when it first arrived to our table but once we started digging into it, it was a decently sized appetizer. The sandwich was a good portion and really filling.   Service was good. We were seated as soon as we arrived and they were just persistent enough that you felt tended for but not rushed which was great. Food came out in good time intervals and nothing was rushed or delayed all evening long.  All in all a solid experience, I would like to visit again to see if there's consistency with the quality and service. Also, Trinity Common is also known to be a popular brunch spot, so I would love to visit for brunch sometime as well.  Recommendations: Always reserve, even if its just a group of two. The restaurant got busy really quick even on a Tuesday night. They have a pretty varied menu so try something new! Match it with a nice craft beer from their beer menu (I recommend the Railway City - Black Coal for any stout lovers out there, think Guinness with a shot of coffee rinds...but in a good way)."}
{"text":"The experience my friends and I shared here on a Saturday morning was nothing short of magical.  As soon as we walked in we felt right at home and at ease - we immediately knew that this was exactly the restaurant we had been hunting for.  We all had brunch food which was unbelievable.  I had the hot links.  The links were good but were not the show-stealer.  That honor belonged to the potatoes.  To my surprise they were sweet potatoes! Crispy with lots of flavor and mild onions.  I ate every piece on my plate despite being full.  The drinks were great as well.  We all had mimosas made with grapefruit instead of OJ.  At only $6/glass they were a great deal.    Their beer selection is impressive and I would absolutely return for late night drinks.  Last note of praise: the service was exceptional.  Welcoming, friendly, helpful.  We were charmed by everyone who greeted us."}
{"text":"My meal choice; Eggs Bennie with beef brisket.  SO pleased with everything!!  The bomb.com  Friends ordered; the 'Classic' bacon was way undercooked and fatty. If I ordered the Classic, this rating would've been a 2 star. I LOVED mine and would go back for it 100%!   The patio is great to people watch and get some sunshine"}
{"text":"This place gets really packed and quite loud. There is a huge beer selection as well as a good food menu. I wasn't in the mood for drinks so I ordered two things off the menu. The lemon pepper wings were awesome, buttery and seasoned just right. The wings were also very large with plenty of meat. The beet chips on the other hand was not crispy at all, and didn't have the best texture. The sauce that came with it was fresh but didn't really taste like anything. For my group, a few of the orders were mixed up as well."}
{"text":"Affordable booze and a very cozy setup. If only they have a bigger patio and sangria and pitchers."}
{"text":"I went to Trinity Common last night with some friends, and if you're looking for a variety of craft beers, it's worth it to check out. If you're looking for anything else... there are a lot more places you can go.  The decor is great--very simple and minimal, I loved it. The atmosphere and patrons are, well, interesting is the best way I can phrase it. My first thought when I walked in was \"gentrification,\" with all of the beards/man buns/hipster glasses, it was kind of funny--but that's not the bar's fault, just a little anecdote I had to throw in (and that didn't affect my rating at all, but if you like beards then go here).  Food wise, it's good, but the very limited menu is really over priced for how much food you get. I had the mac 'n cheese, and although it was good, it doesn't mention having meat in it on the menu, but there was some sort of ham/back bacon/something in my food, and even though I eat meat it was a little bit unnerving to see random reddish brown chunks that don't have very much flavor in my food. But for $12, I expected WAY more, and considering the food on its own was just a 3/5, it wasn't worth it.  The biggest problem is the small space and a lot staff who come off a bit apathetic. Don't get me wrong, our server, the bartender, and the bouncer/security guard were all incredibly nice, but I got the vibe that they really didn't want to be there. It was also incredibly annoying that we were told it would only be a five minute wait, and thirty five minutes later we had to REMIND a staff member that we wanted a table, and not to just sit at the bar, as we were waiting for two more people to meet us and there was not enough room for them to join us at the bar. In the end, a five minute wait turned into a forty minute one, but at least we were able to order drinks. A huge downside was how LOUD the music was. I was literally two feet away from one of my friends and could not hear a word he said. Both of the bartenders working had to lean over and ask people to repeat their orders two or more times, it can't be good for their hearing, and it's annoying as a customer to have to repeat yourself several times. They have a mostly full bar, but the huge focus is on beer, so there are a lot of kinds of alcohols they don't have (unless they use it in one of their cocktails).  The bartender who got our drinks was also very nice, when I couldn't decide between two she let me taste both (I went with Mort Subite because I wanted something super fruity that wasn't cider, and this tasted like tangy Fruitopia, in a good way) and she checked in on us frequently.  Overall it was very average, I would go back if it was a good friend's birthday or everyone I was with really wanted to go, but probably wouldn't wander over on my own."}
{"text":"I made a return visit to Trinity Common yesterday, during Kensington Market's last Pedestrian Sunday of the year.  It was my 1st visit since Aug., from which my previous review is taken.  This time I cane with 3 others so we were a party of 4; we were asked if a seat further back inside would be okay and we said yes.  The service was quite prompt and friendly; we ordered drinks only and I had a beer, namely Confederation Amber Ale by Flying Monkeys Brewery, which I really enjoyed.  Perhaps due to us being there on a Sunday, my (our) drinks were discounted so I received .81 off the regular price.  A pleasant surprise.  As a result of another enjoyable experience there I see no reason to downgrade my prior 5 star rating."}
{"text":"We had supper this evening at Trinity Common in Kensington Market.  Gord ordered a Passionfruit Salad and Ceviche Tacos.  He said the Passionfruit Salad was delicious ... worth going back for.  He said the Ceviche Tacos were just okay and wouldn't get them again.  I ordered teh 24 Hour Marinated Buttermilk Fried Chicken.  It was delicious.  The waffles weren't as light and fluffy as I'm used to but that's because they were cornbread.  They were more dense and filling and worked.  The chicken was huge.  Because it was thighs, the meat was tender.  The syrup was sweet with a bit of heat.  I'd get it again.  Don was our server.  He was friendly and took good care of us.  As a head's up, they don't serve coffee or tea."}
{"text":"Came in with high hopes, large spacious dining area inside, very woodsy and comfy. Ordered classic bacon and eggs, which took about 45 minutes to arrive. Sweet potatoes were underdone, server had promised they were not spicy but they were indeed a little on the spicy side. Toasted baguette was dried out and unappetizing. Everything was rather greasy. Ate four hours ago and it's still repeating on me. Glad I didn't leave a tip."}
{"text":"Very funky unique space with clever cocktails and food options.  A little on the pricier side for this area but for a step up it's worth it"}
{"text":"Great spot in Kensington for affordable comfort food with a great selection of craft beer. The atmosphere is trendy and the waitress was super friendly and gave awesome recommendations - the Trinity burger, wings with their Sticky Dill sauce, and chicken and waffles. Everything tasted great but the highlight was the Trinity burger which was juicy and topped perfectly with pickles and sauce. The fries were not as crunchy as I would have liked and they only came with the burger and not the other two dishes. But their portions are more than generous and will be sure to leave you stuffed and satisfied!"}
{"text":"Here is a compare and contrast exercise. What is it like to get a beer at Trinity Commons, and what is it like to get a beer at its smaller neighbour, Pamenar?  Pamenar:  Enter. Walk up to bar. Place order and pay. Receive drink. Take it to a table of my choice and enjoy at leisure.  Trinity Commons:  Enter.   A sign tells you to \"Wait to be seated.\"  You wait five minutes to be noticed.  Get seated with a menu. Because you are only one person, wait another five minutes for the single, overworked waitress to return for your order. Order a beer.  Wait fifteen minutes for your beer.   Drink most of your beer before waitress returns. Ask her for the bill.   Wait 8 minutes for the bill.   Wait three minutes for her to return with the machine. Pay. Get the hell out never to return.   Plus the beer tasted like dishwater."}
{"text":"Trinity Common is one of the more spacious restaurants in Kensington Market. There is plenty of seating which can fill up rather quickly on a Friday afternoon. The dining area is very open and the ceilings are high, allowing for a cozy atmosphere.   The place does get quite loud and busy, but it feels more like part of the mood than it does an unwelcome disturbance. Service can be slow and inattentive as a result, so keep this in mind if hip, well trafficked bars are not for you.  Must-try items: Fried Chicken & Waffles Trinity Burger Chicken Wings Sweet Potato Chunks St-Ambroise Cream Ale  The ambience near the front windows and bar is especially appealing for folks like myself, with a really nice view of Augusta Ave. and all the people walking by. The food took me by surprise, as it was really well done and satisfying.  There isn't anything on the drink menu under $7 except the smaller servings of wine, but the food is fairly priced and the portions are worth it. Give this place a try, you probably won't regret it."}
{"text":"A strong beer selection, my weakness. A WELL DONE BBQ, and I'm on the floor.  I'm in between here.  I'm internally (now, externally! Hello Yelp & Instagram) pleading that Trinity Commons brings back their old BBQ menu. What went from a GENEROUS and endless praise of fall-apart meat selection (brisket was my pick) and two DELICIOUS sides (fries and broccili! so good) for $9, jumped up to... NOTHING AT ALL... So I had to settle for \"wings & fries\" - really, 6 chicken wings and fries for $14.  ... I feel betrayed. There wasn't even a damn courtesy cornbread in the mix. I showed you off to my girlfriends on a valuable patio-worthy Thursday evening and you went and changed on me just like that.  Trinity Commons is why I have trust issues.   (you don't even link nobody no more, you dashed me away like a cyattie, yo, you cheesed me dog *drake - how 'bout now, c'mon guys)  **Take note: Booze from $7, ample seating space - put your name on the patio list and wait inside while you booze yourself up!"}
{"text":"Yikes!  This place has a great beer list and cocktail menu but that's about it.  The staff here were RUDE and scared at the siight of 8 people at one table.  Everyone ordered a beer and one person ordered food (me) and apparently splitting up the bill for this was a huge task.  Also may I mention that the restaurant was quite empty so it's not like she was super busy and didn't have time to print some separate bills.   Besides the rude waitress, the bartenders and other staff members were equally as rude, unfriendly and just had some ridiculous hipster attitude that no one ever likes to encounter when eating or dining out.  As for food, I ordered the wings, fries and buffalo cauliflower.  The cauliflower was actually very good, but the wings were disgusting! They were fatty and had no flavour, they tasted like they were microwaved.  The fries were generic and boring.  I will not be visiting this place again."}
{"text":"I was here on a Sunday night and it was fab. Not busy, but they have a great drink menu and live music. The guys playing on Sunday night was incredible. This place loses one star because the service wasn't great. Our server was friendly, but slow to refill our drinks. We had empty glasses sitting on our table with no sign of our server. Given that it wasn't a busy night, not cool."}
{"text":"I thought the food was amazing! My friend said the beer on tap was amazing too. Only thing was that service was pretty slow, and I found it a little pricey. Make the burgers come with fries too!! I was disappointed when it wasn't :("}
{"text":"Good beer selection. Great location below average service. The service irritated me to the point we decided to skip dinner and go somewhere else"}
{"text":"We were trying to decide where to go to dinner one night and someone suggested this place. Sure, why not.   Neighborhood: plan to see everything on your walk there... wow, so many culture changes and great people watching. It is definitely a younger/hipster area with street artists, artistic graffiti... etc. Such a fun place to walk through.   We got here at about 7 and we were able to sit right near the patio. The location was a lot larger than I had expected it to be.   Servers were quick and friendly. We were given the beer menu (front and back page... with a ton of ciders) and the menu of food (only a couple of options for dinners).   I ordered the ribs and instead of potato salad, I got fries... best choice of my week... maybe even my life.  The ribs were good. They had great seasoning/flavor. There were I think 6 ribs that came with my dinner. The most amazing part however were the fries. They were made absolutely perfectly. I had said to the group that they were the best fries I had ever had... If not the best, definitely in my top 5. They were salty and were super fried, without being incredibly greasy. nom...   They only had a few items on the menu... so that would be my only downside... I think that there were ribs, wings, and tacos. They may be working on adding more food to the menu, but as it is, quite good!!!"}
