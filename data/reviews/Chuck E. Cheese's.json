{"text":"Great location clean facillities our food came out in a timely manner. Salad bar was well stocked and maintained and all machines worked.  Being from hawaii i like the salad bar is all you can eat.  In the islands its not. Ooh they have beer!!!"}
{"text":"This location is run very poorly. Chuck E. was announced to be coming out and all the kids did the countdown... No mouse or rodent of any type was to be seen anywhere.... The Chuck E. Cheese dance song played through its entirety.... No mouse. I asked several of the employees and they kind of shrugged and started radioing each other and still no mouse. A few minutes later after the song was over and all the children and parents gave up looking for Chuck E., a tiny Chuck-E-Cheese came running out through a few tickets in the lobby and left again. Extremely disappointing on top of the fact that they could not get my pizza order correct twice in a row. Seriously, veggie pizza- no black olives or cheese. It came out crust , sauce and black olives.... Take 2- crust, veggies... No sauce or cheese.. Sad times here. #VegasStrong"}
{"text":"This is probably the worst check e cheeses I've ever been to. Staff was very poorly trained with little to no ability to handle minimal tasks. On top of that the staff were extremely rude!, slamming  the toy my son picked out for my son on the counter and screaming at a coworker saying \" ugh you take care of hen I'm done\" have some class. I know I'm talking about Chuck E. Cheese's but still. Recommending  that no one go here."}
{"text":"Chuck E. Cheese, an Icon for kids ages 3-??? It's not going to be known for it's culinary achievements but for the memories the kids will take with them when they go home.
If your coming here for anything but that you missed the point."}
{"text":"I live in between two Chuck E. Cheese's and always thought this was the better of the two. We hadn't been for about a year (it's usually a place we go to beat the heat of summer) so I was very surprised to see how changed this location was from the last time we were there. First off, a sewer smell hit you in the face when you first walked in. It got way worse when we walked in the restroom. I practically had to drag my daughter in, she did not want to go in there!  

We estimated about 25% of the games were broken. There were out of order signs everywhere. Between both kids, we lost about ten tokens to games that just did nothing when you put one in. So many games were now two tokens, instead of one, so needless to say, we were going through tokens like crazy.

I did give two stars instead of one because the food was good. We had salad bar and pizza and those were very good.

Just a sidenote: Ryan B.-- thanks for pointing out that the rowdy teenagers causing problems at CEC were mostly African American and Hispanic. Because we all know white teenagers would never cause any problems. Wishing I still taught high school, perfect example of systemic racism to show my students!! Wow.  #workonyourracism"}
{"text":"The WORST experience EVER. Ordered their sample platter and asked the wings to be prepared without sauce (naked style) and fried twice to ensure extra crispiness. They gladly took our order and we waited while the kids played in their playground. Ordered at 12:45pm and the order was ready at 2pm. Not kidding! We were all famished so didn't care it took so long so started scarfing down the food. We took a bit of a wing and was immediately GROSSED out by it... It was RAW! How could this be? They were preparing it for over an HR and it still turned out RAW? And a chicken dish no less! 
We obviously returned it and the explanation we received was that it's because they had to double fry it to ensure crispiness that's why it took so long. oK, fine, I can appreciate the candor and perhaps next time, tell the customer that it may take over an hour to prepare some wings Bc of the extra frying. However, I am not a professional chef or anything but if you fry chicken wings twice and for over an HR it shouldn't be raw still, right? 

The manager was nice enough to refund our money but I feel inclined to write this review Bc while I was waiting for our order the customer next to us was complaining about how his order took 45 mins to cook (a medium pizza no less) AND how they even got the order wrong! That is so nuts! 

We love Chuck e cheese and I, personally, grew up enjoying such fun and delicious establishment. But this is a family place and I would like to remind them that to shouldn't take that long to prepare an order (simple order) and he food should be fully cooked. No excuses! (Especially when they don't add up).

I am giving it 1 star Bc we do like the place a lot but this experience was just horrible beyond believe! 

I love Yelp and always give great reviews. This is my first bad review and I actually feel horrible giving it... !!"}
{"text":"Alright, so check this shit out. 1) tokens. 2) pizza. 3) the homies. AND THE CHUCK E CHEESE GUY!! But forreal that pizza was dank af, breh. And they have lemon-like Gatorade on fountain tap?! Damn.. Oh I schooled all the folks in that running hamster machine. Bring the ballpit back with a lazy river full of balls so I can chillax with my pizza. A++ on the chick who squeezed us in with no cover charge. Table and bottle service on p!"}
{"text":"We recently had my son's 3rd birthday here at his request. It was a great experience. Our hostess, Gabriella, was very attentive to our party. Our food was as ordered and brought out promptly. We had three different varieties of one-topping pizzas, boneless chicken wings, and veggie platters. Several of our adult guests commented on how good the food was. They were very accommodating with our personalizations for the superhero theme. We provided balloons, capes for the kids, and an ice cream cake. If you book online, you can often get added bonuses, like extra tokens and tickets. We were also comped several items during the party, like the salad bar for the adults. The bill actually ended up being less than expected. My only complaint is that the parties are generally for two hours, unless booked at an off-time. It didn't seem like enough time to me, but they willingly moved us to another set of tables. This worked as some guests had left and the others were playing games. The tables were really just to house all our stuff until we were ready to leave. Bring cash to tip, as you cannot add it to the bill."}
{"text":"This place is very dangerous. Not even five minutes after purchasing a card, some kids stole my 6 year old daughter's card. The staff is pathetic. I told them immediately and they told me to line up at the cashier. After lining up, they told me there's nothing they could do for me. What a waste of time. They are not organized at all. If your kids love chucky cheese, go to a different one even if it's a little far away. The kids here have no manners. Overall, I'm very disappointed at their customer service!!"}
{"text":"Fraud advertisement on Veterans Day. I am a disabled veteran, I show my veteran ID to the Manager and he said it's only served retired military for a free pizza. I would not bring my family here on Veterans Day."}
{"text":"This location is pretty nice there is plenty of walking space, all the games are working properly. The only complaint is even though you use your play pass card instead of tokens, they still give you paper tickets rather than storing your tickets on your card. And I think it's ridiculous to charge $1 for a wrist band to hold your card. But overall this is great location.


Ok so I wrote my review a little too soon. I went to the front counter to purchase the kids suvoneir cups that they had on display. Their was a couple in front of me at the register, while I'm waiting a lady and her son walks up and stands behind the couple. Once the couple completes their order I walk up and ask the price of the cups the cashier tells me $3.49 then tells me she will wait on me after she waits on the lady who walked up after me!! Excuse me you clearly saw me in the line first, so not wanting to make a scene I waited in total disbelief of how I was just treated. To top it all off I pay for the cups and then I'm told they don't have anymore of them so I ask for a refund after being offered a different cup the cashier tells me to wait while she goes to get her manager, she comes back with a big huge clear bag full of the cups I wanted...smh I kept my composer for the sake of my kids but we will not be coming back here!"}
{"text":"If willing to wait at least 40 min on pizza and willing to have to check receipt only to make sure they didnt over charge you then it's ok for you to come here manager already seems super esssstresss out so dont botherrr horrible service sorry"}
{"text":"Best Chuck E Cheese in town. It's new so it's clean and all the games work. The pizza is better here than any other location. The crust is nice and crisp with a a light garlic butter taste. The staff is friendly and attentive. They actually check back with you and offer to refill your drinks."}
{"text":"My three year old really enjoyed the games and the pizza. We went for lunch on a Wednesday. As we expected, there wasn't many people. The employees were nice and attentive. There were a variety of games for children of all ages. Chucky came out and did a little dance for the kids. My son's favourite part was putting all the tickets won from the games into the ticket counter."}
{"text":"I visited this location on my son's 4th birthday 5/18 and it was very nice inside and the arcade games are in better working condition than anywhere else, the employees were all very friendly as well. 

Unfortunately the pepperoni pizza we ordered took nearly an hour (52 minutes), and when a game wasn't working and ate a few tokens, I stood at the prize counter at least 10 minutes and eventually just gave up. It's going to happen no matter how new the games are, sometimes they don't work and I completely understand that, but there just wasn't adequate help at all. 

Maybe everyone called in sick and they were short staffed but whatever the cause, the wait times were completely unacceptable. It's a single pepperoni pizza not a 5 course meal, 50+ minutes??? I hope they can work that out as everything else is great."}
{"text":"Apparently they've decided to try and upgrade the equipment; however, while doing this they got rid of several games.  Also, there were 8 games that were not working.  We were surprised when we arrived and there were a dozen top patrons during the summer, after playing for a bit we knew why.  My 10 year old stated that Chuck E Cheese was no longer the place where a kid could be a kid.  HOW SAD,!!!  We will find somewhere else to enjoy games, etc."}
{"text":"This was the absolute slowest and most unorganized chucky cheese.  I have been to many chucky cheeses and you expect some discourse.  But went here doing the weekday for bday party.  Many rides didn't work.  Hard to find a staff member (harder than home depot). Wasn't even close to full capacity.  Maybe it's government owned ....that slow.  Come here if you want to throw money in the air.  This is my first 1 star rating ever."}
{"text":"Take my kids here all the time. Great bargain $20 for 90 tokens. My kids love it. Food is okay but it is a kids place. Great for indoor fun."}
{"text":"Chuck e Cheese is going to be Chuck E Cheese. Lots of germs spreading without a doubt but this is the only Chuck e Cheese I would take my kids to in town. It's overprice of course, but it makes the kids happy! We actually love their buffalo wings here and their pizza is ok. The sweet tea is nasty here so don't get it!"}
{"text":"This is my first time in this particular chuck e cheese. It's located in a shopping center so it's not really big it looks smaller then most maybe just the way it's setup.  The party area is a decent size.  Make sure you ask for coupons.  Sometimes you can stack the coupons.  Is not as loud as most chuck e cheeses i have been to but maybe because it's the holidays."}
{"text":"We were part of a birthday party and my wife ordered my some chix tenders/salad bar. I'm dieting so didn't want pizza. After waiting an hour, we brought it up to a worker. He went to the kitchen and said he didn't know what was going on, speak to a manager. When we brought to his attention, we asked for our money back. He didn't say anything, not a sorry about that, Please let me take care of that for u. Nothing. That made me a little pissed, well that and the fact I was hungry. I told him he should learn some customer service skills and an apology would have been nice. He says nothing. I walk away. My wife told me later that he told her \" boy he's in a bad mood\". I wasn't actually just tired of rude people, but its especially unnerving when there in a job that requires customer service and have zero people skills."}
{"text":"This is a review for the salad bar, and the manager that seems to not care that they can easily give people food poisoning with the way they are currently maintaining the salad bar. I went to this Chuck E cheese location today for a birthday party, and purchased a salad bar. As I was finishing getting my food from the salad bar, a girl employee came out with some tubs of bacon and macaroni salad. The current bacon and macaroni salad containers were about half full. She continued to just pour fresh product on top of the old product. I thought she was actually making a mistake, and found the manager (a tall, white gentleman with a shaved head, probably in his mid to late 40s). I told him what happened and he was very short with me in his reply. He said they put the freshest product out for the customer, and they flip it later.  Um, I don't know about you, but that seems like a recipe for disaster to me! I went over to the salad bar two more times to see them piling \"fresh\" product onto the older product without any type of flipping going on. This totally grossed me out. Definitely not eating food here again if this is how they handle the salad bar. You could definitely tell the manager did not even kind of care. And even if he responds to this that it is safe or that corporate approves of their salad bar practices, I DON'T. If value your health, neither should you!"}
{"text":"We came here for my three year old's birthday and it was a blast!  The pizza was excellent and the price was great, especially because we signed up for the monthly coupons.  Super special thanks to Diana for being so patient and sweet with my son while he was cashing in his tickets for a hockey stick!"}
{"text":"Out of food? How does this place not have enough food? The staff was rude about it and seemed liked they just didn't care about their guest."}
{"text":"I went here today with my 3 year old and he loved it. The only downside is that some of the machines were broken and there was also a weird smell in the whole area. We did not eat any food there, so I can't comment on that. Overall my son had a lot of fun and that's what counts!"}
{"text":"Came here for the kids service was very unprofessial from the managerial position , manager disrespected degrated and humiliated her employee in front of customers witch is completely uncalled for  and I suggest they be corrected because it is completely unprofessional and I will not come back to view such a sharade of disrespect very disappointed"}
{"text":"If I didn't love my kid so much, this place would not be an option. I'm afraid I might have contracted hepatitis from this place. First off, it's a Saturday night. Is it possible to schedule more than 1 person? Waited 15 minutes before anyone came to the counter to take an order for the 20 some people in line. Drink station had more garbage on it than the garbage cans. No ice on either side. Tried to ask an employee, but there were none. Waited 35 minutes for our pizza. Went to the counter and asked how much longer and this girl rolled her eyes and brought out the wrong pizza. She put it on the counter and walked away. Just walked away!!! Asked LUV the manager about the wrong order and he ordered us another pizza which I never received. I was robbed. One bright spot, almost all the games were working!!!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst! At just before peak hours tables were still cluttered from earlier in the day. While there were very few people there, no clean tables were available. Floors were dirty and when told of the situation, no one did anything. 
Counter server was disinterested in her customers. Chicken nuggets were over cooked and dry. There were no napkins in the dispenser at our table.
Horrible experience."}
{"text":"Decided to take my two children and their friend. Saturday night at 5 pm. There were no vacant tables because so many people were using tables as a base camp for their coats, etc. After 15 minutes of wandering, we finally found a table that was dirty but unoccupied, so we asked an employee if he would clean off the table for us. He said, no, sorry, but they were only letting folks sit down if they bought food. I got a little miffed and told him we just paid $50 bucks for two pizzas and some tokens. Only when we showed him our order number did he clean off the table. 

Next, it was another hour before our cheese pizzas arrived at the table.  Then,  the pizzas were HORRIBLE.  How hard is it to mess up a plain cheese pizza?  These had hard crust, almost no sauce, and very well done cheese. I complained to the manager (who turned out to be the man that refused to clean off a table). He said the only thing he could do is give us a guest pass for a future visit, but that if we didn't like the pizza we probably wouldn't benefit from a guest pass.  Had to go through a McD's drive-thru after we left, since they wouldn't eat that pizza. They do not have Coke products nor Dr. Pepper.

The games were busy, and I know people don't have to watch their children closely here, but little BABIES were just wandering around, getting in the way of my kids' games.  A couple of the games didn't work or didn't give tickets, and that wasn't received well by my kids. When our tokens were gone, we went to the ticket counter/muncher machine...but not all the ticket muncher machines were working, so the lines were long...took the kids about 20 minutes to wait in that muncher line, and then another 20 minutes at the prize counter.

Some of the games were fun, but my kids said they would not want to go back. Bottom line, I wish I had spent that $52.xx elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is the first negative review I've written in 25 years! 
I drove from Fort Lauderdale (10 hour drive) to visit with my neice/family and arrived at this location at 1:45 pm. My family paid for me to eat the lunch buffet before I got there, which ends at 2. I greeted my family, proceeded to get some lunch, and by that time, the buffet was being taken down to prepare for the dinner salad buffet. 
I calmly asked for a slice of pizza and explained the situation. The lady working the front was rude and told me that there are no exceptions. I proceeded to ask for a refund, no problem. She refused to give me a refund so I ask to speak with the manager..he was also very rude with me. I never got pizza or salad, and the manager refused to give us a refund. He literally said \"someone should have told you that lunch ends at 2\". WOW! Horrible customer service. 
Also, the mouse came out for about 3 minutes (looking like a hot mess) and most of the children were unaware that he was even out dancing. Overall, a rough experience!"}
{"text":"As a long time customer, I will never return to the Flamingo/2-15 location ever again after the way I was treated by Gilbert who somehow, was hired for a management position. As soon as I arrived and was paying for my kids' token cards, he informed me that \"They are NOT a bank\" as I paid with a $100 dollar bill.  Ok. Great. My 5 yr old played one game before dropping her token card on the ground, which I paid $20 for, and it was kindly picked up and returned by another little girl to the cashier. When I realized what happened and explained what happened, the cashier said she accidentally gave the token card away to the wrong child. She asked Gilbert for help, and with his smug look said \"Nope, nothin I can do\" and walked away. I trailed behind him, and asked for help thinking there is something that can be done, and he looked at me and said \"Shouldn't have lost the card, nothin I can do\" and walked away from me. It's not about the money. It's about customer service. He is in a management position, and should handle himself like an adult. He's rude, smug, and is oblivious on how to treat people with respect. I feel sorry for the kids that have to work under him, as one young man said \"you have no idea what he's like to work for\"...you lost a loyal customer, and I'm guessing my family isn't the only one to never return because of him."}
{"text":"Apparently they are in the process of remodeling but I was very sad to see that they will no longer have the kids tubes and slide. This Chuck E Cheese is the closest to our home and I'd have to say it's one of the smallest locations we've ever been to."}
{"text":"Well kids love this place and the pizza is edible, if not something I would cross the street for.  There are scores of games that allow you to convert cash to essentially worthless junk, by way of the tickets.  There are some little rides and things like that. There is animatronics stage show.  It is usually crowded and fairly chaotic.

Don't get me wrong - I enjoy attending birthday parties here with my kids and they of course, are ready to move in."}
{"text":"First the cons:  1. The birthday tables are too close to each other so you're bumping into the people having their celebrations next to you. 2.  Our host, who will remain nameless, was a total space cadet.  She brought one thing out at a time.  Table cloths 10 mins later plates, 10 mins later veggie tray, 10 mins later forks, our pizza order didn't arrive until after an hour of our 2 hour reservation, then more cups trickled in and finally one hour and 45 mins later she brought the basket which contain all the silverware and napkins.  This is after we spoke to the manager.  We did manage to get the attention of another host who was busy but very kind and accommodating and she was extremely helpful, Hannah was her name.  She should be promoted and provide training to the rest of the staff. 

The Pros:  1. Kids didn't know the trouble we were having with the service because they were too busy playing. 2.  Coincidently we were ready to sign Happy Birthday along with the Televised Chuck E Cheese so it appeared that the entire place was signing to my grandson which made him feel extremely special.  3.  The nameless host did manage to get Chuck E. Cheese himself over to our table to pose for a picture with our birthday boy.  

Aside from the poor meal service the party was great for the kids.  Adults waiting for plates, silverware, cups and napkins, not so much.  I'll never have a party there again but wouldn't mind bringing the kids back to play."}
{"text":"We came to this Chuck E Cheese with the hope that it would be a good experience, considering its brand new and looks nice from the outside.  Well with that said it has not been a pleasant dinner. We ordered 2 pizzas, wings and the salad bar. The first things I notice immediately  is the tables are all dirty, the salad bar is empty.  Then we are informed that the pizzas will take 45 min to an hour.  We were just hoping for a fun family Wednesday night. And it was not what we hoped for. Sadly I do not recommend this place. And probably won't return."}
{"text":"Besides being a germ factory, this place is poorly ran.
I know that everyone sees this as a kid's place but it doesn't have to be ran this badly.
An honest 30% of the games were out of order...these are the life blood of this place.  Another 30%  would eat the kid's tokens and still not work.  I would assume it's pretty common bc the workers wouldn't even question me when I told them how much I had lost.  They'd just grab a hand full of tokens and refill my coin cup.
There were toddlers crawling up the skee ball lanes with no employees intervening.  Granted the parents should have controlled their kids, but they were no where to be found.  In which case the workers should have tried to restore some sort of order.

This place is what it is but to get the best experience for you kid, I'd suggest the C-E-Cheese off Sunset."}
{"text":"2nd time here because my Granddaughter just loves Chucky E.  Too bad he doesn't come out to much!   Maybe he comes out more on the weekends!  Today we had the Lunch Buffet I guess it's worth the price they just need to bring out the pizza faster!  The 3 hrs. that we were there, there was only half of a desert pizza which by the time I was ready for something sweet there was none.  This Chuck E. Cheese was much cleaner & games were working compared to the the one in Henderson which I would never go back to!"}
{"text":"Good place for kids. Not the best service. Some machines dont work get my grandkids tokens and never people to refund."}
{"text":"My daughter invited for her friends birthday party. The hubster and I flipped coin to fairly decide which of us would be stuck going. I lost unfortunately.  I have no issues with the establishment it's self, it's the horrendous atmosphere.

 Parents who don't watch their children,  or discipline them.  Our pizza delivered while we were at salad bar. The children across our table were eating our pizza. The mother just giggles how kids are kids. They did replace the pizza. This will be our last time herr. Not worth the headache and aggravation."}
{"text":"Worst Chuck E Cheese I've ever been too! I was expecting a bigger salad bar. I come from San Diego & our Chuck-E-Cheeses are better and bigger."}
{"text":"Me and my friends had a bachelorette party here! As we went down the slide these kids were just staring at me and i said \"what chu lookin at homeboy?\" and ran away. Always reminds me of my childhood! We were a bit stared at the whole time until my friend stacy yelled out\" whats wrong with a bunch of 24 year olds have some fun?!\" as she played the song girls just want to have fun. I won alotta tickets that night and bought myself a better ring that i had before. (BTW i think they recycle their pizza)"}
{"text":"Wow, by far the best chuck e cheese I've been too! It's the most updated and the cleanest one I've seen! The employees are on top of things."}
{"text":"Upsetting that they never bring Chucky out, there is a sign clearly stating he will come out every :30 of the hour and I asked if he was coming out you could clearly see them talking bad about me, cause they were annoyed the guy went to dress and just walked out threw the tickets and went back to his dressing room, I've been to this one 4 times and they literally never have him come out.  UPSETTING my kids love chucky but this place have bad employees"}
{"text":"I have been going to this location for quite sometime and each time just gets better and better. My family and I went this morning right when it opened and everything was well organized. We bought food and it came out fast. The manager on duty was really nice. He was helpful when we were picking out prizes for the kids and even gave us some free tickets when we were at the ticket machine! I will continue to keep bringing my kids to this location!"}
{"text":"I always take my nephew here but it's a lil over crowded here. I don't understand why but it seems like the location off of eastern is more busier then any other ."}
{"text":"This place is horrible!! None of the games work and the games rip you off with the tickets !!! This place is not fair for kids"}
{"text":"The cashier guy didnt know the answers to any questions we had about the menu. The salad in the salad bar was old. The pizza was ok. My 2 year old daughter had a blast & thats the reason we were there. It was clean but super packed even though we arrived just after opening time."}
{"text":"The food was discussing  an there's no limit on how many people are in the building so so it's a shit show to get anything"}
{"text":"Kids love it. The games are fun but could be way better. Need to update this location and the characters who sing and dance. Rides are terribly slow. Good for babies not grown kids."}
{"text":"I had an awesome time! Staff very friendly! Food was really good too... the only problem is i got a stomach ache!!!! After an hour or so my stomach was acting up!!!! I don't know if if it was the salad or pizza?  Unfortunately I don't think i will come back."}
{"text":"I won't go to any other chucky cheese this is by far the cleanest and SAFEST"}
{"text":"Avoid the chuck e cheese at eastern and 215 - they must not clean the place it is filthy. My son has a great immune system and still got sick three times after going there. So have his friends . The one on sunset road is clean and quieter If you want to stay in Henderson - no problems there  !"}
{"text":"Had a party here on Saturday August 5th, purchased a cake from here and it had mold spots everywhere. Didn't realize the cake had mold since they provide a host to cut and serve the cake. Sadly about 10 of our guests are the cake before we noticed. At first they said it was sprinkles dissolving from the bottom, but the mold was in the middle of the cake. They admitted it was mold and that they had 7 cakes in the back dated the same day as the one we purchased. They said they would check them. Took a couple of pictures. I'm still waiting for a call from corporate. Also have had some of our guests get sick."}
{"text":"I always have a blast watching my kids have fun here at Chuck E Cheese. 
The salad bar is great and seems like the pizza has improve over the years."}
{"text":"I loved Chuck E. Cheese when I was a kid and I can understand why kids nowadays love coming to this place. The pizzas are OK. The wings are pretty good and they have a small clean salad bar that is acceptable. This place is maintained very well and the bathrooms are pretty clean. The arcade games need some up to date games and the carnival games are such ...carnival games. You spend $20 for tokens and you get tickets so you can redeem items that are worth 10 cents. Wow! Capitalism at its best. This is a kids paradise and with the exception of the jacked up prices, you can be assured that the little ones will have a great time in here. All the employees in here are very helpful and so patient with the children. Good job guys! I also appreciate the fact that they stamp the kids with the same number as the adults that brought them there. Although it is not a perfect system it is a very helpful precaution in keeping the kids safe. What a great idea! Good clean fun with some extra help from the staff. I guess the $ is worth it."}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool great atmosphere for the children. Did not like that they did not accept my Groupon. why are you advertising on Groupon if you do not accept it? The place was pretty clean but wasn't that long of a wait and the food is took about 20 minutes arrive."}
{"text":"I had my daughters 7th birthday party here and let me tell you the absolute worst nightmare a mother could have about a party!!!!!!! Nothing was organized NOTHING!!!! my party host was the worst and did the worst job ever!!! She did the cake extremely late and I had a piñata which they never even did by the time the cake was cut the party was over and people were already leaving!! They placed utensils on my table for the party and during the singing of happy birthday the next table beside me decide to come over interrupt ask the hostess if she can take my forks the hostess which her nickname was (nae) short for ojenae  (possible spelling error) and the hostess said yes letting her stop everything to take forks for her table which led to an argument between our tables ruining the entire party I calmed down my family for the kids so we tried singing again and again they interrupt to make comments to me and I had to ignore and the hostess is just sitting there dumbfounded letting the situation go if I had not stopped it who knows what she could have let progress!!! Then when it was over I pulled my hostess to the side asked her why did she allow them to interrupt my party she relied Cuz their forks are on your table, I said where Is mine she replies it's on another parties table I had no room.  I told her that I had 4 adult tables beside the kids table so she had the room. And if I would have interrupted the other party it would have been another fight at the party which I didn't want! Then the list I have that was sent via email explains everything that is supposed to happen at the party and none of it was fulfilled. I am so angered and embarrassed it's unbelievable! Then my mother asks the salad bar lady for 2 forks and she was disrespected when the manager was told she exclaimed she has a history of attitudes we have sent her home several times she has even disrespected us... now my question is if your employer does not have the customer service skills that are required for the job then why are you still allowing it to happen??? This isn't even half of what happened but this made my point a total and utter DISASTER!!!!! corporate will be hearing from me!"}
{"text":"Very bad business. Compared to other Chuck E Cheese we have been to, this one was definitely the most frugal in terms of the number of tickets you can get from each game as well as the prizes.
Not going to this place again, and not recommended to others, unless your kids don't care about tickets or prizes."}
{"text":"SO ANNOYING, they don't honor tickets won from the Chuck E Cheese's skate game app via your smartphone, apparently you gotta bring in a printed version & their hours are posted incorrectly on both yelp & google (this location opens at 11:00am not 10:00am). Get it together Chuck E Cheese's!!!"}
{"text":"Had our daughter's 3rd bday party there and it was a big hit with the kids.  Was a bit crazy with all the kids but was great fun! The best part was that I didn't have to clean up after!! The kids loved all the games. Highly recommend to parents of young kids!"}
{"text":"Absolutely aweful!!!  In all of my 39 years, I have never experienced such poor service, nor have I seen such aweful employees as this restaurant.  Maybe it is just this location, but twice I was in line and the person working there just walked awaywhen it was my turn to order (once when I got there and once when we were trying to get a toy for our 3 year old with the tickets).  To make it worse, when they walked away, they didn't say nothing to me, they just left, and it was to restock more cups.  To top it all off, they gave attitude when I informed them I was waiting in line before the other people being waited on.  My wife and I have gone there three times, and all three times it was worse than the time before.  Three strikes, and you're done...You're done Chucky, and to anyone reading this, save yourself the aggrivation...don't go."}
{"text":"Great fun for kids 12 and younger. Safe environment for kids. But this location does not serve beer. So absolutely nothing for adults. Bring your tablet and do what I'm doing."}
{"text":"Pizza has to be the worst in Vegas.  Salad bar low on items or dirty.  Drink bar is messy.  Front employees have problems with math and understanding.  Even when you help them they still screw it up.  Better off going to Shark Reef or Circus Circus.  I plan to spend my money elsewhere, you should too."}
{"text":"I would not recommend it the employee was on her phone while helping a costumer it was dirty and the pizza was horribly greasy"}
{"text":"Chuck e cheese is srsly the best man better than Dave and busters better than Niagara Falls this place makes a kid a kid"}
{"text":"This Chuck E Cheese's location is similar to whiping before you use the toilet; it's all out of order.  The only reason I used a poop reference is that this place is crappy.

We came here on Memorial Day with the kids (4 and 6) for some pizza and fun.  The pizza is similar to Little Caesers, and is perfectly fine for kids, but the fun wasn't as easy to swallow. 

There were at least 6 machines that did not work, yet had no out-of-order sign posted.  While this place isn't the most expensive source of entertainment for kids in the valley, nobody should be tossing their money away due to a lazy staff.

The bathrooms were messy, and the place had an overall dirty feeling to it.  When it came time to cash in the kids' tickets, we waited at the ticket counter for a good ten minutes before being helped.  Do you realize that they have prizes listed for 150,000 tickets?  Can you imagine having 150,000 tickets in a drawer somewhere in your house?  Ridiculous!!

For the money you'll waste here, you're better off doing something outside with the kids, ordering (or cooking) pizza, and then taking them to the toystore; it will be cheaper, healthier, and less mousey."}
{"text":"My wife and I had our daughters 3 year old birthday party here yesterday evening and it went perfect. The food was fast and good. Our hostess Diana was very attentive and nice. She seemed to really like kids which is kind of important if you work at chuck e cheese. This place was perfect for for a toddler party. They also had fun things for older kids as well. I've never seen my daughter so happy. She was laughing, dancing, interacting with Chucky. Can't say enough of how happy I am we went because of how happy it made my daughter. Oh one more thing most of the machines were working. Sometimes they would randomly be fickle and take your coin but I didn't see any that said \"out of order\""}
{"text":"I took my 3 year old for the first time early on a Friday (no crowds), and we had a blast. The staff was friendly and the pizza was good. Some of the games were out of order (hence the lower star rating), but we purchased the hour play so it didn't hold us up."}
{"text":"If no stars was an option that's what this location would get. Half the game machines are broken (missing pieces, steals your token, and just doesn't work) staff will not clean up the tables, so people thst leave their food, drinks, and plates will stay on the tables for hours, there is about 10-15 workers. But you have to search for someone if you have an questions, food takes about 45-60 mins to cook, then you have to remind the staff you haven't received your food, then when you have your food it's burned, over cooked, old, horrible flavor. When you have to tell yourself it's for the kids. It's not even worth wasting money"}
{"text":"Many machines broken and dirty bathrooms. It's hard to find a decent place to take out the kids for an evening of fun. This place failed and failed miserably."}
{"text":"3 stars for my daughter but in reality it's the environment and culture that sucks. I've been here many times and I always sit back and observe the employees here. Most of the employees are young which is good and not so good. I personally think they should reevaluate their age requirement for employees. The employees are not outgoing, excited, and adventurous with the children. I watched and heard many young employees give standoffish energy, rude responses, and have also ignored children right in my face. Revamp your hiring age bracket chuck-e-cheese."}
{"text":"It was a disaster from the beginning. We checked in, got our stamp - fine. Next we ordered food. Lady helping us had no idea what she was doing. Took us 20 minutes to order. The soft drink counter was filthy, trash everywhere. Guests who were there had no manners and morals are thrown out the window. Unattended children all over the place, it's a circus. Took about 50 minutes to get our 2 pizzas that we ordered. And I'm pretty sure a child poo'd in the tubes. There was this one kid that worked there who was working his ass off. Busing the tables, cleaning the floors, bringing out people's orders, cleaning the tubes since some kid decided to take a dump, fixing machines, checking on people's orders.... and that's just from what I saw. I felt so bad for him - I told him - thank gosh you are here, what in the word would this place do without you?? One ticket collector was working out of 5! And their prizes are a joke. Chuck E never even came out??? We were there for 2 hrs and my kids kept asking me- where's check e??? Definitely going to Dave n Busters from now on."}
{"text":"I took my 2 year old here to play on his birthday.  I hadn't been to a Chuck E. Cheese since I was a small child, so I didn't really know what to expect.  It turns out that he's too young for most of the attractions at this location, but that just means that it ends up being a really cheap outing.  We stayed for about an hour and a half, and they only turned on the animatronic ChuckE once.  I wish they did that more frequently, as it was my kid's favorite thing.

They did give us all matching stamps when we arrived, and had signs posted about \"everyone who arrives together leaves together,\"  but no one actually checked us when we left.

I was surprised at the number of adults there playing games.  I'm not really sure what to think of that.  Cheaper than Dave and Busters?

I didn't think it was any dirtier than every other place I've been to where kids run around and play."}
{"text":"Pizza is actually yummy this visit.  Always a clean location but it seems the last few times the same games are broken."}
{"text":"Told staff that a game was broken- she tossed me the number of coins my daughter had put in and said 'I'd suggest not playing that game til someone gets out to fix it' We have been here over 2 hours and there is no sign on the machine and no one has repaired it. I heard an announcement stating they wipe down machines every hour- haven't seen it happen."}
{"text":"We always have such a great time here. As a mother of 8-year old triplets... It's a clean environment, affordable for working families, and the atmosphere is always exciting. Cannot lie... Another benefit great for the parents.. They have BEER! We have had nothing but great interactions with an incredibly friendly staff, and great manager (Mike D.)... Thanks for the great time, looking forward to coming back!!"}
{"text":"This was such an amazing event for my 2 year old. The party was fantastic. I had the 2 best staff! Halley and Ashely is the reason why I would totally do this again! They sat down with me and answered all my questions...she helped us with our food told me everything I needed to know. Just was so heartwarming and kind hearted. We live in San Diego and may have to do this again next year here. Thabks for an amazing day you guys were fantastic"}
{"text":"You don't expect much from chuck e cheese and boy do they deliver. It was fun for the kids until they won 200 tickets on the game and the game broke. Took them like 20 min to resolve it--which isn't really a big deal. However the manager was terribly rude about the whole thing & Acting like wasting my time wasn't a deal. He was kind of a jerk."}
{"text":"Through the past years of my life, this chuck e cheese was the beat place on earth (besides disney land) and I just left only to be unsatisfy unlike all the other years. After being completely bored at home, we decided to take my niece here and when we got there everything was okay, but then we got to playing and eating. First off, half of the games were broken so we only reached to about 120 tickets, and secondly, the pizza service seemed to have died. (See attached photos) the pizza was literally deformed and when I walked around, all the pizza's were the same. There was trash all over the floor and the bathrooms were really dirty."}
{"text":"Never coming here or to another Chuck E. Cheese again.
Food is over priced compared to what you can get for the same price at Peter Piper. Pizza tastes like Little Caesar's deep dish which is only $8. Very subpar. Tables remained dirty for a long time. The Kay out of tables and games was kind of confusing and not very thought out. A lot of games were out of order and  there were barely any games that you could win a good amount of tickets from, most give you two or three. When Chucky came out he ignored my kids trying to hug and high five him and he just kept dancing instead. One of the most disappointing things of the whole visit was the prize selection, what a joke."}
{"text":"This place is so nasty. Everytime I take my kids here it never fails they get sick with a fever!!!!! This place needs to be inspected by the health department and closed down. I have never seen them clean the machines so I guess thats why. Done with this place not worth my kids getting sick every visit."}
{"text":"We came here for a friend's birthday party.  We have been to several of these in the past where many of the games are not working and the building is not well kept.  This location was new and had 90% of the games working.  The party host was amazing and they even had a completely gluten free set-up for one of the members of our party."}
{"text":"Maybe it's because I've not been to a Chuck E Cheese in a while but they have gone down hill. The staff all seemed clueless. Our party's pizza came out an hour and fifteen minutes AFTER we ordered. The games pay out very little tickets. We will stick to Dave & Busters and Peter Piper."}
{"text":"Typical Chuck E Cheese experience. We came for a birthday party and this time was a pleasant experience because there were only 3 parties for our time slot. This particular location is probably the nicest one in town due to its size and play area. 

The staff here is young and barely helpful. While I appreciate the high security to go in and out of the place with a stamp to verify that the adult and child \"belong\" to each other, I shouldn't have to wait 10 minutes to exit because the person who is working the exit is also working the Dippin Dots station. I find this place never has enough staff to adequately help customers. So don't expect much from them. 

And the food is mediocre at best. But the prices are equal to restaurants in town. 

Very grateful that there are other options in town for a similar experience e.g. John's or Dave & Buster's"}
{"text":"We had my daughter's 4th birthday party here. On arrival we were greeted by the manager who showed us to our table and introduced our hostess Placida who was very sweet and attentive despite it being a busy Sunday night. The food came out rather slow but I'll give them a break on that because they were busy and our party was pretty large. I reserved the Gold Package that provided 40 token for each kid and it turned out to be plenty with even some left over. The staff was constantly going around cleaning up and the food was average tasting. The kids had a ball and loved how Chuck E. was doing constant rounds. My family and friends had a great time but I would recommend to bring coupons and book online to save money because it was expensive."}
{"text":"We used to live by here and they were great. Now we come occasionally bc we live further away, it seems to be new management and not as friendly.  I just asked for Oreo dippin n dots.  First they said they didn't have any.  I was looking right at it.  And they said well it'll only fit in a small.  I said fine.  They give me a small, and I looked and they still have a bunch more.  I said, I just want the rest.  And he said it'll barely fit in a small.  I said just give me the rest.  So he pours a large 3/4 full and then charge me for a large.  I would've paid for a large to begin with!  I tried explaining this to them, and they were so confused it was easier than fighting over a dollar, but not too hard to write a bad review about it."}
{"text":"This has to be the best Chuck E Cheese's I've been to. Food is always great! I always get the buffet and they will make any pizza you want.  The manager is wonderful. He is very attentive and is always making sure the customers are happy.  Another staff member I would like to acknowledge is the gentleman that is usually cooking the pizzas, I don't know what his name his (tall Asian gentleman) goes above and beyond to make sure we are happy. We will drive to this location because of the outstanding service. Thank you!"}
{"text":"We went this morning as soon as it opened for my nieces birthday. It was not crowded at that time & all of the staff we encountered were super nice. What was disappointing was the amount of games that were out of order, & there was at least 4 times I had to find someone to help us because a game wasn't giving tickets or not working properly.   I started feeling bad for the guy that was fixing all the issues, he was very nice each time I went to talk with him. Staff maybe it would be a good practice to test & make sure games are working properly before the doors open (this is what the guy that was helping us was doing but he was doing it as people were playing. Then he had to be interrupted to go fix something.)."}
{"text":"Worse Chuck e Cheese experience WHEN IT COMES TO FOOD. Very disappointed in the staff and Manager. Ordered a cake, and they gave me a number said it would be right out. 30 minutes later they tell me they ran out of the one I wanted and that I was suppose to notify them when we were ready for the cake. Manager was no help, big let down."}
{"text":"This place is a dump. We went here for a party and the place is so gross and dirty. None of the machines work and they are all old and dated. Chuck E. Cheese always seems to attract the best people too, you know what I mean? We won't be going here again. I recommend another location."}
{"text":"Shout out to Bryce. He is always animated and energetic. My kids recognize him every time we come and he always goes out of his way to say hi and make them feel special. He's just a good kid. We love seeing his happy, smiling face! Keep up the good work, Bryce!!"}
{"text":"Had my neice party there and it was lots ofvfun.. they were super attentive. We had a very good experience!"}
{"text":"I bring my 3 year old to this particular location for a few reasons: the biggest one being the coins and tickets. I love that they still have coins and tickets and haven't switched to cards yet. It makes games more fun when you can SEE the tickets that you win as opposed to a number on a screen. And it actually makes sense to small children. I also love that every single game is one token. And that they have a separate toddler section that is mostly those little rides in front of grocery stores that toddlers love for some reason. There are a lot of great things about this location. Now for the downside... my biggest complaint is that they have signs up saying that Chuck E. Cheese will come out on the :30 every hour.  Well, he doesn't. It's happened 4 times now. And the worst part is that they still do the whole big production with the video and 7 minute countdown just to have him not show up at the end. My son is SO excited to see Chuck E. and it absolutely breaks my heart when he stands by the sign waiting for Chuck E. to come and does the whole dance by himself and then eventually bursts into tears when he finally realizes that Chuck E. isn't coming. Oh, and the salad bar is RIDICULOUSLY over priced. I can go to an unlimited buffet for the price of their one trip dinky salad bar."}
{"text":"I have to admit, just like the several other parents I know...I've always had a dislike for and Chuck-E-Cheese. Just the name of the business made me think of germs lol. BUT, when my daughter became old enough we decided to bring her here for some quality family time and hopefully it would be entertaining for her as well. 

I LOVE Chuck-E-Cheese!!! lol. I'm sure this place is filled with kiddie germs and that  used to scare me, but now that we've been more than a few times (we're regulars) it doesn't bother me. We'll order our food and buy tokens and while we wait for the pizza to come out we'll play a few games. We ALWAYS make sure to wash our hands after playing the games or handling the tokens and most definitely always before eating our meal (don't we all do that anyway, even at home). 

This location is pretty clean, the staff is very nice, our pizza usually always comes out hot. There's a fair fountain drink selection. The salad bar is good. The wings are good enough. I don't know what the men's bathroom looks like, but the women's bathroom is pretty kept up. 

Couple of tips...
ALWAYS go online and print our coupons!!! it makes all the difference. If you have more than one adult in your party take advantage of more than one coupon!! SAVE YOUR TICKETS!!! I know, it's harder with the older kids...they win their tickets and at the end of their time there they want to spend all their tickets right that day. BUT, if you plan on re-visiting it's so much more worth it to save the tickets for another trip because unfortunately even 100 tickets barely gets you anything, and the things it can get you are cheap and ...kind of sad. And of course, if you don't like a crowd, avoid going Friday-Sunday. 

My finace and I make it our mission to win tickets!! Especially since our daughter loves running around to nowhere and dancing with Chucky more than she actually plays any of the games. She's never had to settle for any of the LAME prizes in the glass display, she always gets to pick from the top shelves AND still have some tickets left over for another trip. 

Bottom line, COUPONS and SAVING TICKETS, is the key to make any Chuck-E-Cheese worth your visit."}
{"text":"Good if you like having the flu. My friends baby can't say it right and calls it ****y cheese lol!"}
{"text":"This place was great! I assume because it's still brand new is why it's so clean. Pizza was actually really great! Got a large thin crust with pepperoni! Better then some places around here haha. I'd definitely go back! I also like that each game is only ONE token"}
{"text":"Been going to CEC with my kids for over 15 years. Usually a great time. Haven't been back in a while as the kids got older. We did go yesterday for my daughter and a few friends for some games and pizza for her 11th birthday. Nice new games and card system. More choices with the games now. 
The employees were using a booth right out in the open as their personal hangout/ place to eat. They had work paperwork on the table and boxes in the seats. That stuff should be kept in the back and their hangout should be ina break room and not taking up a booth. 

Ordered a beer and the girl who rang it up said she was under 21 and couldn't pour it. The lady who could was helping kids redeem tickets. Waited like 10 minutes, seemed simple to switch places but they didn't seem concerned. 
Probably won't be back for a while. Time for the dave and busters type places."}
{"text":"What you'd expect from a Chuck E cheese franchise. My nephew's birthday party was here and it was overly packed which I guess is normal in a big city. Kids had fun.
The one star is for the ridiculously rude staff. Literally only met two friendly girls who had good customer service and that was the greeter... And the young lady taking pizza orders at the counter. It's kind of sad when the 30 people at your party are all annoyed at how rude the staff members are. All the annoying things about being crowded are all expected , but you'd think for working at a children's place the staff would have some training on customer service."}
{"text":"Could not give 0 stars so i have to give 1, service was garbage, i ordered chicken wings and waited for an hour.  Like literally an hour, manager told me they could not found my table but server told me there was a hold in the kitchen.. Bunch of liers, place is filthy, i would not bring any kid here, dont come here and dont try their food, seriously, service was really really really bad!"}

{"text":"So, not having children myself, I try to avoid these places at all costs. With that being said, I have 10 nieces and nephews and they all love this place!
So, the littlest has his 3rd Birthday yesterday and of course a trip to go see Chuck E is necessary. It's Friday night in Las Vegas, who would have thought the place would be a mad house! They were definitely understaffed, and the place was a disaster! The bathrooms were so dirty, I was scared to use them!
Needless to say, the birthday boy didn't notice any of this, he just wanted to have fun and he did! Thanks Chuck E!"}
{"text":"We used a online coupon for a large pizza but we got a medium. It's always busy. My son doesn't seem to care. But they need more workers at the front and the prize stand. Prizes are complete crap. But I wouldn't expect much else. Every time I take my son there he ends up sick. It's a cesspool of germs and it always smells like sewer walking in. But like I said my son enjoys it. Unfortunately I think I may have to stop taking him since he always gets sick. Not worth his health."}
{"text":"This place is crawling with so many different forms of bacteria and viruses. My kids get sick here everytime, I'm done with this place. They definitely never sanitize the place."}
{"text":"Went here for a party. Clean and great staff! The kids enjoyed it. I really liked their pizza too."}
{"text":"* Pizza is average and well presented
* Place looks clean and all games were in working order
* Average priced (with lots of options to claim free tokens and prize coupons online)
* Decent service and can get busy at times"}
{"text":"Fun place for a kid.  We did a party their for our boy and there was ABSOLUTELY NO SECURITY.  ANYONE COULD WALK AWAY WITH A CHILD.  In other cities Chuck E Cheese has double doors and a person standing at the door at all times.  Here they had some toothless kid who looked like a felon at the door occasionally.  Do not bring your child here."}
{"text":"This is awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   (°¿°)
It is the best place ever and it has prizes!!!!
And it is really really fun it has lots of arcade games for people to play and it is EPIC and fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We booked our son's 3rd birthday party here. We arrived with our party at or about 5:50 and party was at 6:00 on a Monday. We were greeted at the front and got all of our hands stamped. We were lead to our table by a host. Never seen her or spoke a word again until 6:30. Kids were all at table and finally the host came and took our order for tokens and food. She took forever to get them too. We did not get tokens until almost 7:00 and food 7:30. This was the slowest service ever. We had to ask for plates for the adults when the food came out. She was hardly at our table. We did not get done with cake until after 8:00. Our party was finally done after 9 p.m. I never had one balloon at table or crown for my son. When we were leaving I had to ask for it. After paying $159 for a small birthday package, I will NEVER come again. The manager at front was no help. They were too busy with other parties. I ordered a salad bar and people were going back to salad bar with dirty used plates and manager didn't stop them. This place has gone downhill and I will never return"}
{"text":"Inconvenience!!!  Spent $60 in food and the Manager comes to our table to check what was charged asking for my recipe to check the charges... OMG !!! This is how you run your business???  Hospitality \"0\"  awful experience!!"}
{"text":"Our family had a birthday party over the weekend at our local check E Cheese to celebrate our four year special day. Never again will I host a child's event here, sadly to say the employees were great. The only complaint I have is that there general manager is an absolute moron and should not be allowed back into the faculty. I can't say enough!"}
{"text":"my son has a blast here. the food isn't great but it can amuse him for hours. The machines are a bit stingy on the tickets and some of them are expensive to play but the staff is kind a helpfull"}
{"text":"Two stars for the guys hooking it up with coins! LOL

Conveniently close to home and what kid doesn't like going to Chuck E Cheese!?

This location wreaks of gross smells upon walking in..
Then soon as you walk in you can already tell how filthy the place is -- coin cups EVERYWHERE, pieces of broken tickets, foods, and random trash all over the floors.

Another minus for this location is 60% of their machines were \"not in service\" or not working properly .. Always eating the coins or not producing the tickets.. 
Also, there has been the need to chase or wait a long time for an attendant to help you with anything, unacceptable on a slow night.

There's not much to expect from a place like Chuck E Cheese but a little cleanliness and working machines would suffice."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant tonight so that my son could play the games and have some fun and over the hours of playing the games not once did anyone come around and santize the games after so many people were touching them.
So I went looking for a hand sanitizer and they only had one at the exit as you were leaving. They should be set up all over the restaurant."}
{"text":"A fun mad house. Kids like the pizza. Lots of games for all ages. I have never had a bad experience. I would warn those with epilepsy to stay away. There is a lot of lights to stimulate the senses. Several big screens, but no sports games for the parents to watch."}
{"text":"Came in with a large group on 12/27 didn't let us sit 
next to the party area even though their were 
no parties at the time nor later. Pizza was cold. Staff is young and doesn't 
know anything about customer service."}
{"text":"We celebrated my daughters 4th birthday there today. Evey one was so friendly. Donovan was are party host and he was great! So nice and made sure everything was going well through the whole party. I couldn't have asked for a better host.  The lady behind the ticket counter was so sweet as well. She gave my birthday girl a little extra on her special day. This location is very clean and all the games were working as well. I think the only thing was the bathroom was a little out of order but nothing to make my day bad. I would return here without a doubt to have some family fun."}
{"text":"This Chuck E Cheese was okay. My daughter had a blast, but some of their games were not working so that was a bummer. The food was good, but everything was slightly burnt. We might give it another try in the future."}
{"text":"Planned my sons 5th birthday party here. My fault for doing it on a Saturday. The place is packed. Total insanity. Very, very loud. Don't expect to be carrying on any conversations with the other parents. Kids running everywhere. Kids had fun. I mean it's Chuck E Cheese so I wasn't expecting perfection. My beef is with the pricing. Kids cost $12.99 each for the party package which is no biggie and you can order extra pizzas for parents at $16 a pop. BUT you also have to buy individual drinks for the adults too. I don't know about you but I had about 4 times the amount of adults to kids and at $2 a drink that was almost $100 more. They leave that part out until you get there. And no you can't bring in bottled water or anything. This place is expensive for a kids party but everyone has to do it at least once so save up!
Did like that they \"number\" you and your child with a stamp at the door so when you leave they make sure you have the right child. 
Selma, our party hostess, was great. Very helpful and one of the few teenagers working there that wasn't totally hating life."}
{"text":"Wonderful staff and lots of fun games. They just increased some of the games to 2 tokens, but still a great deal."}
{"text":"It's not as run down as most of the CEC's I've been to before and there's a lot of parking even a creepy back alley of parking spaces (don't park there!). With that being said I just can't stand this place. It's loud, the food is terrible (unless you get the salad bar), most of the games are out of order and does anyone watch their kids?? 

I see the allure to have birthday parties here, it's a one stop shop. You show up and they do everything for you. I mean what party isn't complete without a dancing rat and obnoxious party host? Kinda generic if you ask me. You'll be better off going to The Mini Grand Prix, Pump It Up, Bounce U, or The Discovery Museum for a far better experience. But much to my chagrin, I can't deny my kids love it here so I get suckered into taking them. I hope they'll change their mind about this place soon but until then I guess I'll have to suck it up. Sensory overload ugh!! :/"}
{"text":"Not the cleanest CEC that I've been to but my children enjoyed themselves. And chuckee himself was not present"}
{"text":"This review is specific to this location.  We have been to many Chuck E's in the Vegas location, with our usual being in Henderson.  This was our first time here, and maybe because it was a Saturday night it was insane.  This place was packed, tons and tons of kids.  Several games did not work or stole our tokens, but we were very happy with the different selection of games that we have not seen at the other Chuck E's.  Also, there seemed to be a divide of toddler appropriate games on one side and games more skill orienated on the the other side.  When we were able to locate a worker to tell them that a certain machine ate our token, they would give us a few extra (maybe because they secretly knew we would lose many tokens in machines that night).  The tricky part of the token stealing machines is that they would take your token once and let you play, then when you decide I want to play again, it would steal that token.  We did not stand in line for the prizes because there were just too many people.  The soda machine was out of ice, but the all you can eat salad bar was usually always freshly stocked and there was usually someone there to give you a new plate (which used to be required by law, but I have noticed the sign about the health department requirement has been removed from all the Chuck E salad bars I have been too).  As for the gate check guy, he had just left when we arrived to leave and we had to wait about 2 minutes but he was very apologetic.  There was a fight in the parking lot from some individuals who had just left a child's birthday party.  It was rather scary in that some of the individuals in the argument were in cars and there are obviously small children running in the parking lot.  

I would probably try this location again, but will not do it on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"My children love Chuck E Cheese's! 


We stop here every single day for dinner.

The kids love pizza! And games, we currently have 9k tickets saving up in the Fun-House in our home!"}
{"text":"Pizza was burnt. Chicken Caesar salad wrap had maybe 1 oz of chicken in it. \"Mixed fruit\" consisted of 3 pieces of oranges. All tickets now reduced for most games. Chuck E Cheese did not come out on time. Kids waited for him. Maybe dress issues. It's very dirty at this location."}
{"text":"I'm with Ms. B. on this one. Back in the day, Chuck E Cheese used to be the *bleep*. Now... well now it's where I take a big group of kids when I do not have the patience to do arts & crafts until their hearts content.

Chuck E Cheese used to be my 'heaven on earth' growing up as a kid. Now, it's my salvation when I'm babysitting :)"}
{"text":"For such a filthy place to eat at, you'd think the staff would be smart, quick and polite, but you'd be wrong. We went they're on a Thursday night and the place was not too busy but that didn't stop the staff from taking their sweet time taking and placing our order.

We actually had to spell the order out for the poor girl behind the counter in an effort to guarantee accuracy but that was to no avail. The multitude  of dirty tables was a nice treat as it made our table selection very quick and very easy. All we had to do was find THE clean one.

When the pizza was delivered it was the wrong pizza. We ate it anyways because really what's the difference?

Many of the games my family played either didn't work and would steal our tokens, or it wouldn't spit out tickets. Luckily all you have to do is play a new game called \"Find the Manager\" and boy do you get some cardio exercise out of that one. I've got to hand it to them on this one - it is a new twist to family entertainment that I've never encountered at other venues... maybe we're just used to getting what we pay for without the track and field run around. 

The only way I'd ever go back to this CEC would be maybe if I left my wallet or child there, and depending on which child or how much cash I had in the wallet that's still a pretty big \"maybe\"."}
{"text":"I haven't been here for over 10 years. I spent a lot of money just to bring a grandkid here. It was very expensive for us that retired and have very little expendable money. It was a lot."}
{"text":"Not a good experience. Went on a Wednesday night for a five year old's birthday. No music, no show, no appearance by Chuck E Cheese from 6 - 8pm.  Children dissapointed. Had to complain to manager to finally get Chuck to come out once prior to close. Still no fanfare, music or anything. Most kids didn't even see him as he only walked a short distance out of the door. Would not recommend this location."}
{"text":"I thought this location was very clean with a great assortment of WORKING games. I paid for the $30 Value deal and was very happy. The pizza was good quality, and a good time was had by all. I really admire the way the person at the entrance, La Donna was so sweet and kind to each child! She should get a raise."}
{"text":"Kids from 3 to 13 will enjoy it. However, if you want good pizza you should dine elsewhere before going here. 
The staff is good at crowd control which is critical with so many kids running around between games. 
It is a little pricey so be aware."}
{"text":"Yeah, five stars.  Compared to other Chuck E. Cheese's locations?  It's not even close... this is the best I've ever seen.

I've been here a number of times with my kids.  I live in Los Angeles but I take my kids to visit my parents who live near this location.  We have a couple locations in LA that I've taken my kids to and none of them as good as this location.  Most recently, I took my kids here on a Saturday night.  I repeat - SATURDAY... NIGHT... AT... CHUCK E. CHEESE'S... and I, A) lived to tell about it, and B) still five stars.  

MANAGEMENT
If you zone out with my review, let me just tip my hat to the manager here... he's amazing.  I assume it was him working Saturday night.  His workers ALL had great attitudes, were helpful, smiling, immediately got to everyone with questions, fixed games immediately.  I even saw him personally fixing the bicycle helicopter 'ride'.  Again, check my past review of the West Hills location where their manager was completely the opposite.  

Anyway... 

WORKERS PT 1
Walking in, there were plenty of workers at the counter, which is RARE at Chuck E. Cheese's.  There wasn't a line, just ordered and got our table.  We got two pizzas, boneless hot wings, salad bar and drinks.  The food came out quick but, honestly, the pizza did take a really long time, which never happened.  It took 30 minutes for the pizza.  

WORKERS PT 2
The place is far bigger than most other locations yet, it's really clean, no trash on tables, immediately workers are wiping tables.  They really cared about keeping things clean... and again, this is a Saturday night on Thanksgiving weekend when it should have been a disaster -- but it wasn't.  Also, yeah... I see people with one star reviews because tickets ran out?  Um, they're paper... they will eventually run out, my God.  They don't magically reappear.  Yes, one machine my kid won tickets on ran out so I simply asked one of the many workers walking around and he simply fixed it and gave her the tickets... done in literally a minute.  People need to show some friggin' patience.  (Notice the 'gotcha' one star reviews and their spelling... kinda goes hand in hand.)

GAMES/RIDES
There is a really nice variety of ride and games that most locations don't have.  They have all of the super young games for kids, then the older ones as well.  They have a couple driving and racing ones, even a ski one.  Thank you for leaving up the jungle gym when so many others have ripped them out for some reason.  

FOOD
Personally, I always annoy people when I say this too much but... the pizza at Chuck E. Cheese's is better than it needs to be.  It's really good.  Here was no exception.  We also got the boneless chicken wings which were great.  The Salad bar, like everything else here, was clean.  I noticed a worker with gloves cleaning it constantly (with customers making a mess).  It was stocked every time I went up.  I think there used to be ham cubes, but not that night.  I wish they'd bring that back, though, so there's some kind of a protein... but no biggie.

SECURITY 
My wife and our other family got there ahead of time with the kids.  My father and I came in a little later, kinda like two guys off the street.  I honestly wished they questioned us but the younger worker let us in no problem.  I think they should ask if we're a part of a birthday party, if so, which one... or do we have kids here.  Otherwise, there's zero reason to have two guys come in without kids.  Granted, we were wearing polo shirts and hopefully didn't look like creepers but you never know.  Going out, the worker checked the kids' ultraviolet numbers... but again, if it's two guys coming in without kids, they could hide out in the bathroom and wait for kids to, 'ya know', not do good stuff.  Unfortunately, a lot of parents just let their kids run to the bathroom here, solo.  That's the only area I'd say they need to improve but I don't know what company policy is. 

OVERALL
Again, favorite location - easily.  The bar was low for it being a Saturday night, I went in expecting chaos but it was clean as a Tuesday 2pm session, I'd imagine.  Finally... a location that looks like the commercials :)"}
{"text":"I wanted to lower the stars a little because the pizza was not very good, but I kept it at 3 stars since the games were decent.. at least they were all working? Just sad that the pizza looked and tasted like cardboard. It was a nice way to let the kiddo get his energy out, but sad that we spend so much money just to get a few plastic toys and candy in return.. but I guess it's the fun they have, right? Eh."}
{"text":"I can only give this place 2 stars simply because it just isn't nearly as fun as the one I remember from when I was younger.  This one only has some fairly lame video games, and a small tunnel system for kids to climb through.  Everything here is overly expensive.  Tokens themselves cost at least .30 cents per token, and kids win tickets playing games but unfortunately you have to spend about $500 dollars to get enough tickets for anything remotely cool.  The kids do like coming here, but kids are pretty easy to please when you throw some games and pizza in front of them.  I could get way better value taking my kid to the arcade museums we have here in the Las Vegas area.  The pizza is better than it was a few years ago, but it's still nto very good, not very big and cost about $20 for one pizza and 2 drinks.  There were several machines not working at all, with kids losing tokens because the games don't have any indication they won't work.  I came here for my son becaus the school was having some special school night here, but otherwise I would rather take my child to something more fun and more productive than this.  I have also been to kids parties here.  The parties always feel somewhat rushed by the young staff and is crazy expensive for what they actually give you.  2 stars because kids like it, bot nothing more because it's dirty, expensive, and the food isn't very good.    NOTE:  Parents do not seem to know how to watch their kids when here.  I always see kids stealing tokens off tables they don't belong too, and just kids in general runnning crazy with no supervision.  If you bring your kids here, I would hope you at least keep them being respectful and at least be aware of what thet are doing."}
{"text":"Took my son to Chucky cheese for a birthday party he's two years old it was his first time .. At first he seemed a little freaked out especially the big mechanical rat I think he thought they wanted to eat them.  one hour later with ice cream and cake smeared all over his face and  the fact that he cracked some girl in the head with the ski ball I think he enjoyed himself. Some people call you a rat chunky but you're okay with me four stars"}
{"text":"Our first and last time here. The place was overcrowded, loud, stuffy and dirty. No proper playground. The place stunk so bad that my child asked to leave. If I could give it a zero, I would."}
{"text":"If I could rate this place a negative review or any lower I would especially after dealing with Owner a Mr. Melvin who is nothing short of a low life crook and I'll be more than glad to explain why! So on my sons birthday party we went to the Chucky Cheese website to book our event and we did a reservation for 5:30 was elected how ever upon arrival we were told no your party was actually at 5:00 needless to say the services provided included a little show and servers and other little add ons which now would NOT be provided how ever they still charged for those same services 167 dollars and said we could have our party and see what they could do so.....to start our party for 7 kids and 9 adults 37 minutes into my sons little event the power completely goes I right away ask were some of my food was which also \" had to be returned for not properly being cooked \" crazy up till now I know right well here is the best part so upon asking how low until the power would be back an employee there stared well they say maybe 3 hours I explain to the employee that isn't going to work for me and apologize and tell him no problem you know what give me the difference from the food that was sent back and what was not delivered plus the money for the services that were not provided and I'll pay for the food and drinks that were used and we will leave and just go to my house, the employee looked scared and said ummmmm well you see 2 weeks ago when it last happened we were only allowed to give vouchers for later dates! Mind you this is a birthday party !!! I again explain that was not going to be ok with me and would not work and to call his owner or boss which they did, only to come back and tell me \" the owner stated he does not care about your sons birthday party and its not his problem the power went out he provided services which we had received \" to my surprise I had already grown to expect this so that actual conversation was recorded just for my safety and security of dealing with shady companies in the past I was also not provided a name that day because the owner didn't want it released and was given a card and told to call the following Monday morning and speak with his secretary. Please DO NOT DO BUSINESS with this location the owner is an uneducated classes smuck who I have reported to the BBB and also Arizona Works Employers Administration he is a crook and robs people that day easily no less than 50 people lost their money and the absolute worst part of this all was that my sons birthday was completely ruined and he really use to love that place but with Owner like Mr Melvin there is absolutely no way we will ever go there let alone use my money to do business with an animal like that"}
{"text":"When did CEC become so cheap??? All games used to be one token. They update their mascot and the cheap rat raises the price of the games to TWO tokens per game and yet the price of the tokens hasn't changed. Lame."}
{"text":"My son loves this place! Lots of games, good pizza, relaxing environment! Especially love their new unlimited play program!! Always a Fun & Enjoyable time! Convenient location with great parking! Friendly staff & Management! I'm quite surprised this location only received 2.5 stars?! I've been to other locations that wasn't as clean or up to par service! So If you haven't checked out this location then it's a definite must you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Pizza is good, but that is about it. Service was terrible. Half the machines were not working. Ticket counters were not working. Beer taps were out of order for both our visits."}
{"text":"I'm going to make this review short and sweet.

The Good,
Friendly staff. My niece was stoked to see Chuck E and even received a high-5.


The Bad,
There's shady kids lurking around for tickets and the power cards to steal. My nephew got his card swiped by somebody but I guess I'm partially at fault. I'm not from around here so I didn't expect anything like this to happen. Therefore I would highly recommend purchasing the wrist bands that attaches to the card, which are avaliable at the counter.

I would also recommend eating before your visit."}
{"text":"This Chuck E. Cheese's horrible none of the games work everything is a mess and it smells badly."}
{"text":"It is the typical Chuck E. Cheese fare.  The customer service is okay.  Make sure you check the salad, because sometimes the veggies aren't as fresh.  I always get what we order, but the timing could use some help.  The manager Gilbert is a huge egomaniac.  I heard him yell at the workers on weighing the chicken wings.  The wings were supposed weigh a certain weight and he wanted to give less to the customer.  I was so surprised! So, you might want to check on your wings. Other than that, the place is pretty clean when we go and the hot food is always freshly cooked.  We don't really have a lot of choices this part of town."}
{"text":"Horrible place for a birthday party. We arrived 15 minute early as we were asked, by the time 5:30 came the other party was told they needed to leave immediately because we were the next party. The other people had to clean up their party instantly with no time, while we stood their waiting awkwardly for them. Then it took forever for them too have our party decorated and set up for while our guests were waiting. It took them forever to bring out our token for the kids, and an hour for the pizza to come after we found out it wasn't even ordered, even though it was ordered online with the party. Everyone acted like they didn't know what was going on and every time we asked to speak to a manager a different manager came out. The place was dirty and had trash piled up high and the bathrooms needed serviced."}
{"text":"Best Chuck E Cheese I've been to in AZ by far. Friendly, attentive staff and many appearances by Chuck E Cheese himself. The pizza was okay nothing I'd go specifically for, but the kids had a blast and I'll definitely bring them back."}
{"text":"If i could i would. Give it no stars not enough staff slow service rude employees i brought my daughter for her birthday and it was terrible most the games were broken waited 20 mins for a cake all around bad service won't be celebrating another one of my kids birthdays here"}
{"text":"First time I been here i oder  1 pizza and 10 wings wait for haft hours they bring me pizza with out wings then i wait for 1and haft hours more they dint bring wing yet i keep asking them but they are doesn't  care about customers  there services  is really  bad and so dirty  I will won't come back no more"}
{"text":"My friend held her daughter's birthday here last Friday. It was supposed to be from 6-8, but the table wasn't set up till 6:15, the token cards weren't passed out till 6:30, and the food came sporadically over the course of an hour. I'm not trying to be harsh, as I know the establishment was busy, but I feel like setting the table up and loading token cards are things that could've been done in advance - having known the party was booked for several weeks! The real icing on the birthday cake was when our party host used his hands to pack up the leftover pizza! When I asked him about it, rather than admitting his mistake, his response was, \"I just washed my hands. They're clean.\" How unprofessional! The manager ended up comping my friend a pizza to go since he touched the other half, but even that man did that half-heartedly with no eye contact. And then wouldn't you know that as we left and our 4-year-old daughter cashed out her tokens, my husband asked if she could just get a 50 token item with her 48 credits as she couldn't decide - and the answer was NO! What?! I was completely disgusted with their lack of professionalism, I don't care how young those kids are in there! Your first job is all about a learning curve, so I hope that someone took something away from the displeasing time we communicated that night. Disappointing experience especially since I've been to this location several times before and they've never quite missed the mark like so many of them did on this visit. Try harder, folks - a child's birthday may be a nuisance and an after thought to you, but it's your job and a cherished memory for every parent who shells out the hundreds of dollars to throw it at your establishment."}
{"text":"We were really disappointed with the lack of service on a TUESDAY evening! I have no idea if a manager was working or anyone who really cared to be there other than the guy cleaning tables!! One of the girls even came out from the kitchen looked at me (waiting at the counter) and turned to go back into the kitchen! I had to flag her down to just ask for a fork!!!

We went to celebrate a friends birthday. There seemed to be a lot of people working, yet no one at the counter most of the night. It took over 30 minutes to get our order and it was wrong, we ended up just getting our money back. We definitely won't return. Seems like there are a lot of negative reviews due to service!"}
{"text":"This is the best chuck e cheese I have been too. Super clean and staff was wonderful. Their food menu is great, it's no longer just pizza.  They have a variety of foods to keep everyone happy! Only bummer was it did take awhile for food to get out. But it was very tasty and fresh! I have been to numerous chuck e cheese all over the country and this was far the best. I like that this has a card system in place so you don't have to lug around a bucket of coins. Will definitely be back to have my son's bday here in February!"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time, money, or jeopardize your child's health coming here! 

1. Highchairs are absoletely filthy! Took over 4 wipe downs before i slowly started seeing no dirt on the wet wipes I was using. (And that's that I picked the cleanest one)
2. The restrooms are not maintained. Absotely disgusting! All but two stalls were actually usable. There was blood in one of the sinks as well. 
3. You apparently can't sit in the showroom unless yiu are having a party? I was asked to move. I will certainly be contacting cooperate on this!! Totally unacceptable! 

The list goes on, but you get the picture."}
{"text":"Goal: The smile on your child's face while here is priceless. 

The Good: weather and allergy proof fun( no pollen indoors), always free to kids, lots of games, my son always meets new friends when we come, food and games in one place, parking is always easy, no waiting like other locations
The Other Good: there are newer locations with wider variety in game options( I notice, but he hasn't missed them)

I choose this one location for convenience and my 6 year old son loves this place. Trading the mall traffic and parking headaches in for more play time."}
{"text":"Brought my niece and nephew for lunch. We came early so we had the entire place to ourselves. Once it got closer to 12, this place got packed!!! ;)

Make sure to go online to print out coupon deals! I printed out a 100 tokens deal + the pizza & tokens deal..."}
{"text":"Brought the kids as a reward for my sons potty training.  The in-laws came as well to enjoy the day.  Kids (ages 2 & 3) had an absolute blast eating pizza, playing games and enjoying all the birthday celebrations going on.  This would have been 4 stars if the prices had not been so high.  I was a bit taken back by the bill, even with an online coupon.

Will likely return in future but it will be a special occasion for sure."}
{"text":"What can I say the kids love it and wouldn't know the difference if it did suck; in this case it sucked big time! None of the machines seemed to work properly at all. Plus like 80% of the games either ate my coins or did not give me tickets for my kids. I continuously had to call employees to either retrieve my coins or tickets. The games that did give you tickets were cheap as hell. You can't fool me chucky!! BUT THE KIDS!! SHAME ON YOU!! Your lucky to get a 2 out of 5! The best part was the McDonalds across the parking lot."}
{"text":"If you're looking for bad pizza, a weak salad bar, overpriced amusements with worthless prizes, and below average service, this is the place for you.  I can't stand the place, but my kids love it.  Something about those tickets I guess.

Be careful though.  They give the appearance of high security for your children, but I've often seen the exit station unmonitored.  Don't take your eyes off your little kids.  You'll also find quite a few machines that aren't working properly, but that will still eat your tokens.

I gave them 2 stars for my kids.  They earn zero from me..."}
{"text":"This place is pretty new.  The first time here, I thought they didn't seem too organized, but it was clean and they were attentive.

This time, we stopped in at around 4:30.  There were at least 7 tables covered in trash from people that had left...apparently a while ago.  That grew to 14 tables in the hour we were here.

It's kinda gross looking for a clean table when the place is practically empty and you have to really search to find one.

They need to clean it up!

BTW:  When did it go from 4 tokens for a dollar to 3?  Ouch!"}
{"text":"Chuckkkkk E Cheeseeeeeeeeee :D

Okay, yes i am a chucke e cheese fan, um who isn't.. (unless you had a horrible childhood and parents who never let you have fun and run around with coins like a mad man)

Came here yesterday for my nieces 11th birthday (yeah, shes a little old for this place, but where the hell else can you have a kids birthday party in vegas?)

We sat at the birthday section of the place and had a long table all to ourselves. My sister in law got one of those meal deal things and im not sure how much it cost but i think it was over a 100. (pizza, cake, coins & chucky gives away tickets to the kids, all included) There were 14 adults and 7 kids. 

The pizza was good, better than i remember as a child. Not big slices but not uber tiny. I stuck with the pepperoni since im not a fan of jalapeno pizza. The cake was a little too sweet for my tastes but everyone ate it. I swear they gave us a bazillion coins! of course i took lots of them and ran around like a kid. Wooohooo, i was the ticket queen. Don't mess with this winner! :)

I like that all the games are 1 coin, i hate going to arcades and i see some stuff is like 2 or 3 coins. its very fair. They have lots of choices for different games. From rides for little ones, to big rides that go in the air, for teenagers i assume. My husband had a blast on the football throwing game and i was a sucker for the coin pushing one. 

The manager was super nice and came over and introduced herself. She was warm and welcoming. Most managers don't give you the time of day so i gave a star just for that. The young lady in charge of our group was super nice and friendly. We ran out of cups a couple times and she constantly quickly went back and got more. 

Overall it was a fun experience that brought back many warm and fuzzy memories of my childhood. I would def come back and maybe even have my childs bday here (once shes older of course)"}
{"text":"I always take my daughter here she loves it.
the place is always ready for customers nice , clean ;the games 
are good sometimes there is one or two out of service ,but staff makes no deal and refunds you with extra tokens.
I recently took my daughter to celebrate her bday party there she love it to the extreme
staff were so NICE and very helpful and gave me candles for her cake and  some cake plates. I am very pleased with their service"}
{"text":"Took my two year old niece here tonight and I can honestly say that I'll never be back. Half of the games and rides weren't working and the employees were nowhere to be found. The place was dirty and the floor near the car ride had tons of papers scattered around.

Most games average 1 - 5 tickets won unless you hit a jackpot. Definitely not the place you want to take your kids if you'd like a little bang for your buck. I'll stick with Incredible John's or Dave and Busters from here on out."}
{"text":"Usually have to stand at the counter for a long time to get help.  The employees standing behind the \"buffet\" and at the register don't pay much attention to customers and could use a little coaching concerning customer service.  

Every time we come here a larger portion of the rides and games dont work.  I expect some things to be out of order but the amount of broken items is getting a little ridiculous.

I imagine one of the worst jobs in the place is cashing out tickets for the kids at the prize counter but I still expect nicer treatment of my 4 year old!  This is a kids place, treat the kids right & get employees that can interact with them.  The wait was also a little excessive.

Pizza isn't terrible and the salad is fresh (impressive for me but my daughter could care less).  Of course my daughter requests to come here often despite my dislike of the place so I guess there isn't much incentive for improvement in the other areas.  I know, by coming here anyway I'm part of the problem.  If anyone knows of a better option let me know and put me out of my misery."}
{"text":"Where do I start? With the good; It's clean and I was pleasantly surprised that they had a somewhat decent salad bar. The pizza is ok. It was our first time taking our little one here and he had fun. The part that was very disappointing was the lack of enthusiasm, or even a simple smile on ALL of the employees faces. Ok, I get it. It was a busy Sunday. Maybe the loud kids and obnoxious music all day gives you a headache, but you chose this place to work and if you hate kids then don't work here. The only smile I saw from any of them was if they were talking amongst each other. Shouldn't it be part of the experience? I'm not too high maintenance when it comes to customer service. I don't expect them to roll out the red carpet but I do expect polite and friendly responses. They actually brought down my mood. When my 1 year old looks up at you and he smiles because you are bringing him pizza, would it kill you to smile back at him? Don't even get me started on the mouse! The video plays counting down the time until Chuck E. Cheese himself is about to come out and sing and dance with all the kids anxiously awaiting on the dance floor. The guy may as well have been wheeled out. Barely went through the motions of the dance, wouldn't move much or interact with the kids at all. The mechanical mouse to side of the stage was more entertaining. The kids were clearly underwhelmed. If you need somewhere to take your hyper kids and stay cool, sure this place works just fine but it could be much better with a little proper employee training on customer service skills."}
{"text":"If you have ever wanted to visit Hell on Earth, look no further than this location on a Saturday night. This place was one of the worst places I have ever experienced in my life. 

When you first enter, you get hit with a stench that just wouldn't go away. This is when you realize that this is a big mistake. As you get closer and closer to the kids check, you see the attendant; an uninterested school kid who is probably counting the minutes until he is off work. They put a stamp on your hand with a number to indicate you child is yours and no one else. 

Once you enter, you are bombarded with a sea of children running around screaming, laughing, crying, and overall noisy. As you move forward, you start looking for a seat that isn't too dirty or used. Its the luck of the draw. There are so many people, but not enough space. You walk through the crowd looking for you table sanctuary. 

Once you settle down, your kids starts showing signs of the craziness like all of the other children running around. \"Dad, can we start?\", \"Dad, can we get tokens now?\", \"Uncle, where are my tokens?\". Unhappily, you go to the order counter to buy tokens...OVERPRICED Tokens. Before you can even count the tokens to see if they are correct, the kids already grabbed them....and disappeared into the crowd. You stand there, asking yourself why you deserve this torture....and slowly walk back to your table sanctuary. 

When you enter their washroom, you get to see where some of the smell is coming from. Kids all over the place with accidents all over the ground. I was too afraid to enter the stalls. Thus, i couldn't comment. All you see are kids coming in, doing their business, and then walking out.... no hand washing or anything. I was afraid to even open the door. 

After an hour, I was at my limit. Constant screaming, running back and forth, tickets all over the place, and the constant nagging for more tokens and fighting over tokens had finally broken me. We grabbed our tickets, allowed the kids to pick out their junk from the \"toy\" counter and was finally on our way. 

As usual, the kids check was a joke. Washed may hands and the stamp was blurred. The guy just glanced at it as I was leaving. I don't even feel that they were looking to check all the number. 

Overall.....well, lets be polite and say I won't be going back any time soon."}
{"text":"This place has the worst service ever,  when we got there we waited 30min for the pizza. And then the pizza was gone as soon it came out everybody was waiting on pizza they had us eating lettuce for 45 min, they only did 1 pizza at a time every 15 min just horrible service took my kids to have a good time they were just dissapointed"}
{"text":"Fun place for the kids to play. They make the card readers to accessible for the infant kids. Should put them high enough for the older kids to reach but let the parents do it for the infants. Infants just run through and swipe it in every game half the time they don't even play it."}
{"text":"At 1st we were little disappointed that we could only schedule our Party for 8pm. However that ended up being the best time to go, because other guests slowly started clearing out & the entire building went from crazy, to calm. 

We had a party for my 8 year old, a lot of parents & kids didn't show up, however Olivia  (our Party Host for the evening) made us feel like we were the only one's there!

Olivia was very patient with me since we didn't know the menu,  very attentive to my guests, she checked on me (the overwhelmed parent) continuously,  & she made EVERYTHING run smooth! 

I told them, she needs a raise! A promotion or something! Her energy was awesome! She made my scared little ones feel comfortable enough to go on stage with the Muppets & meet Chuck e Cheese! 

We're definitely going here again for another party in January! 

Also the place was cleaned, the machines let you know if they were broken or out of order. If the tickets ran out, it'll tell you on screen how many tickets your owed. 

No more Chuck e Cheese coins, its on a swipe card now. Similar to Dave & Busters! 

I specifically chose this location because it was clean last time we visited. I felt Concord was in a very busy location. & I felt the same about the Albemarle Rd. Location. 

However this location was packed as well. 

One thing to improve on, two people need to be at the door at high traffic times. 

I only wanted to go in & check to see if my table was ready, but it took 15mins to get past the door girl who checks people in. She's the only one who can check your stamp on the way out, & stamp you on the way in. 

& because she's so overwhelmed, a child went out with the wrong parents. 

The gentleman asked me if it was my child & I told him no. So please please, get extra help at the front door! This will make entering & exiting much easier!"}
{"text":"The cleanest Chuck E Cheese in Henderson! I was totally surprise how clean this place was.  Good Job and a BIG thank you to Chuck E Cheese employees for keeping this place neat and clean for the kids and adults to enjoy!"}
{"text":"Going to chuck e cheese use to be a cheap treat for the kids. At one time, using a coupon, one could get a large pizza, 4 drinks and 100 tokens for 30 bucks. That coupon is now 40 bucks and most games now require TWO tokens. I found my poor 3 year old sitting there waiting for his game to start before I saw on the screen that he only put in 1 out of the 2 credits needed"}
{"text":"This location was completely overcrowded and dirty.  Over 80% of the machines did NOT work at all which really frustrated my kids to no end.  It was also annoying to us since this place is NOT cheap.  I mentioned that a lot of machines were broken to one of the employees and yet nothing was done about it.  They had soooo many birthday celebrations going on as well.  I get that they need to have the birthday parties, but perhaps they should not have so many at one time.  The place was completely overwhelming and crowded and yet they people kept coming through the door.  The employees were not kind or helpful.  We will not be back."}
{"text":"The restaurant itself is very clean. Everything is like new in there. We have been many times and the games are all always in working order. The salad bar is always fresh, the pizza very tasty but a little greasy, the soda machine always has great flavors. 

The negative parts are the front counter staff is always training, it seems they are always new and very slow. Or even at times they just disappear in the kitchen and you have to stand there until someone decides to come back. The tables aren't bused quickly. The mouse sometimes will not come out every hour, for the children. Sometimes they forget the tickets and have to run and grab them while the kids stand there waiting. If you order a sandwich it will take 20-25 minutes, this has happened 3 times I've ordered a sandwich there. You have to get up and tell them to go find it or they completely forget about it. 

We will go back because our kid loves it the rides are cheap. Overall it's a good time for kids up to 10 years old."}
{"text":"I used to go to Chuck E. Cheese's when I was a little kid back in the 80's... I recently moved near the one on Grand Canyon and Flamingo so I figured i'd check it out after nearly 20 years since my last visit. I went to the buffet at 11:30am (30 minutes after opening) and paid $11 for the buffet and unlimited soda. It was the most disappointing buffet I have ever been to. There were 3 different pizzas to choose from.... cheese, pepperoni, and a supreme style plus some garlic bread and a extremely simple salad bar (if you could call it that). By the time I left at around 12pm, they brought out a 4th pizza which was ham and cheese. The taste was average and the buffet line is about 4 feet long. I wont step foot in this place again and its a shame since I remember going with fond memories as a kid to the original locations here in Vegas."}
{"text":"2 *tokens on most machines...the only single token are th ones for toddlers about 5-10% of the amount of the machines, the rest are now 2 tokens...... Sorry but we are moving to a different place to play...."}
{"text":"Have been waiting for our one topping pizza over a half hour already... The table next to us has been full of old food and dishes since we arrived, the fountain drink section is disgusting, and majority of the games give only 1 ticket at a time. 

Positives: kids have already seen chuck e once and the games are one token a piece."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery via HubGrub and their cheese pizza was excellent. Also got an appetizer pretzel bites with cheese. Very good food and it brings me back to my childhood. I will order again and recommend to everyone else."}
{"text":"Came here for a bday party, on a weekend, so it was packed (which was expected).  A lot of games for kids to enjoy and the pizza was actually really good, from the last time I visited here.  Great service from the girl who was the serve for the party."}
{"text":"I frequent this particular location all the time and normally have a fabulous time with quality food. 
Today however I was greatly disappointed. 
The debt system was down which for some reason delayed us even placing our order for 15min. even though we were not using a debit card. The \"manager\" couldn't figure out how to start up the register so we had to wait for Chuck E. to give away free tix before we could order and the counter work returned to her post. 
After paying for the buffet we noticed the salad was wilted with brown edges. There was no ranch dressing and the pizza's looked old. The ice machine was empty and the paper towels the restroom were also empty. 
We were here for 2hrs and only once noticed fresh pizza being put out with the old pizza still  sitting there grossing everyone out. Several people were complaining yet still no fresh food. At 2:30 we demanded fresh pizza be put out or a refund. . .2:50 three pizza's were put out and quickly consumed. 
This was the worst experience EVER. 
Shame on the manager of this location today that was clearly off game.
 I guess now is a good time to cancel that bday party we were planning for July."}
{"text":"My wallet was stolen out of my pocket. I noticed within the minute and tried to get some help from someone to address the teens I suspected. It was 20 minutes before the manager got to me and \"couldn't\" approach them because I had no proof. We couldn't look at surveillance because the police need to do that. All staff members that I talked to treated the issue as if it happened all the time and I was asking for a lost shoe. There was no concern or action to assist me. And to top it off, I asked for a refund on The game card I bought, but didn't have a chance to play since I was frantically seeking help for my wallet. They \"couldn't\" give me a refund because I bought it on the kiosk and I had chosen no receipt. I will never go back. If you go to this location, keep your valuables in a safe place, and hope you don't need any real help from the staff."}
{"text":"Oh, Chuck E. Cheese, how I have memories of hanging out in your urine-laden ball pit!  I took my nieces and nephew here yesterday for a small family birthday part for one of them and I noticed that although the ball pit is gone, the bodily waste wasn't.  Ah, children!

First of all, the kids (4, 3 and 1 year) LOVED it.  The two older ones just went crazy on the smaller rides, playing the easy games and getting tickets and picking out their prizes.  They thought the pizza was absolutely de-voon.  They didn't see the wear and tear on the games - everything was perfect to them.  And hey, it's made for kids.  They're the ones they have to please.

Of course, as an adult after I was able to see beyond the chaos, I noted that a lot of the games were broken or ate tokens (which we all know are precious Chuck E. Cheese commodities).  Of course the pizza was not good.  And although my  the kids didn't care, I was a little more than horrified to hear someone scream, \"Dookie!\" out of a tube slide.

It ain't my cup o' tea, but it ain't supposed to be. 

But man am I glad I don't have kids of my own."}
{"text":"It's super far from my house but it is the least ghetto. Lol. Definitely don't mind driving across town as long as it reduces my chances of getting shot.

Anyways, walked in and the lady at the door was super pleasant and very nice. I go to the counter and there was not a single soul there. After about 5 minutes of waiting, a lady in black comes out from the back(assuming she's a manager), looking grumpy as hell and takes our order.

Food comes out and it's alright. Still better than Little Caesars for sure. The chicken is small as hell! But I figured it's to feed little children, so whatevs.

The games are all 1 token, but $1=3 tokens. And each game only pays out like 1 or 2 tickets. Lol. And the prizes you can claim are like a minimum of 25 a ticket. Haha. So unless you wanna fork like 100 bucks on a bigger prize, be my guest.

All in all, it's a great place for children. I would bring my nieces and nephews here again. Good job Chuck E Cheese."}
{"text":"This time we went for fun - not a birthday party - and it was a great experience. The kids played and the adults could visit. Salad bar was much improved, pizza average, but the kids had a blast. Fun time on a winter day."}
{"text":"The only thing good about this place was the way my son smiled while playing the games. The food was horrible the service was neglectful and it was dirty!!! I'm sorry chuck e cheeses but I had higher expectations"}
{"text":"Good food nd kids have a blast"}
{"text":"You guys need to choose your employees wisely because there is one girl that needs better training with customer service I was in your restaurant Sunday evening just a few minutes ago for mother and daughters night and the reason I left is because I asked one of your workers named Devin if I could order she said with a very unfriendly tone one second then walked away and never came back I got in at 6pm and it is now 7:15pm i was so mad because of her attitude and the wait I'm siting in my car in the parking lot to make this complaint my kids were excited to play and eat but she ruined our night by being inconsiderate and not checking back with me for over an hr I understand I could have asked someone else but still I shouldn't have to work to get service it's her job to give me service and make my experience at chuck e cheeses the best with a smile on her face she didn't smile at all then as I'm leaving she is behind the counter exchanging the kids tickets for toys or candy if she was a be hide the counter girl she should have never been on the floor handling food like she was a waitress or she should have sent someone else to me I'm just so angry because I work in customer service and I know if my workers acted like her I would have no customers so please train her better because Devin is not a fit employee for a children's place."}
{"text":"It's so sad to see how much this place has went downhill from when I was little. Most of the playground equipment is gone and the characters no longer work like they used to. It was also shocking to me to see that they sell alcohol now... is that really necessary at a children's play place?"}
{"text":"Your typical Chuck E Cheese. Although this probably the nicest one in the valley and fairly clean the staff is incredibly lost and rude. Their machines eat your tokens and the when you ask for help they act like they don't know what a token is. All in all, when I cave in and take the kids to a Chuck E Cheese this is the one I will go to."}
{"text":"We had a big birthday party for our grandkids today at Chuck E Cheese's and they loved it!  Lots of rides, lots of tickets and lots of fun.  Our waitress got everybody yelling for Chuck E Cheese to visit and they were excited.  It was great."}
{"text":"This spot was horrible. The birthday party wasn't even ready when it was supposed to be. The cake they sold wasn't the cake they tried to pass off on us. They made things right but once the manager take to us and we told them things were good, the woman brought the bill and was trying to get rid of us. It was not a spot I will return to."}
{"text":"This place is a mess. I pray that someone from corporate reads these and realizes what a disaster is happening here. When I take my kids it looks like a bomb went off. Every table is filthy and covered in plates and trash. The employees roam around and do not much of anything. Games are broken or eat the tokens. No one cares. The reason I am leaving this review though is because the ONE reason I go to Chuck E. Cheese is the security. Children are stamped and someone should check that the right kid is leaving with the right adult. The last two times I went I was able to leave with my three daughter with no security check because no one watches or checks anymore. It is pretty disappointing for the price that you cannot get your employees to do their basic job"}
{"text":"This place is great to let the kids unwind on a cold and windy day.  A majority of the games are 1  token  and a handful are 2 tokens.  Most machines will dispense tickets for play that you can use to redeem overpriced plastic toys from overseas.  These  toys are not worth the price you pay but the kids have a blast trying to earn enough for prizes.  

The facilities are clean and all games were in working condition.  We chose not to have any food this visit because we ate prior to arriving.  The salad bar area did look pretty tasty from afar.  I might have to try that next time.  We ate before we arrive so this was a play day only."}
{"text":"Half of the machines are broken but don't have an out of order sign so you put coins in and lose them.  We lost at least 20 coins because of this. Most of the games don't tell you how many coins they take. Way under staffed. Bathrooms are gross. Whole place is dirty and run down. Definitely won't return."}
{"text":"I'd give them less if I could , this is a family place where we bring our kids to play not for the employees to stand around chat and do nothing. I come here every time there's a issue pizza takes 30-45 mins to make and no ones ever at the register ! This is unexceptional and this place needs to step it up before you're replaced with a pump it up!"}
{"text":"Cotton candy $2 please.  Oh $2.15 with tax.  I don't know of anywhere you pay tax on candy.  I'm done with this place. They feed our children GMO laden food that's no good for them.  Chuck needs to step up his game if he expects my family back again.  Also most game two tokens now."}
{"text":"Staff barely acknowledges your presence. They just goof around with each other, forcing you to make yourself known (which is usually a rude thing to do). They delivered the wrong food to our table. The place was a mess. Cups, napkins, candy wrappers all over the floor of the gaming areas - again, with staff just standing around goofing off. They were literally just standing around together eating the tootsie rolls. Went to the bathroom, and the trash can was tipped over with garbage spewing all over the floor. Just disgusting conditions."}
{"text":"This place should be renamed Yuck E Cheese!  Do they ever clean in here?  Every time I have gone to this place, it has had half eaten pizzas on the ride or in between the games. I only come here because my kids of course love it. On our last visit, we were so lucky to bring home a souvenir of pink eye!  Despite the hand washing, one of my kids always gets sick and then it gets passed around our home. The coupons of the past were much better then they are today so it isn't as good of a value. I will praise them for keeping the games at one token, most arcades charge two or more coins per play so they get one star for that."}
{"text":"Part one of my daughter's 3rd bday this weekend.  She and her friend had a blast here.  Multiple attractions for the little ones, quite a few arcade games for the older kids.  Every game cost only ONE token.  $10 goes a long way here.  All to see that little child of mine smile makes it totally worth it!   

Standard ticket reward system.  At different time intervals, chuck-e (the rat) himself comes out and gathers all the children for a dance activity.  After that, they shower them with tickets which all the kids scramble to pick up off the floor.  

Be warned, some rides end up eating tokens but when I brought it to the attention of the staff we received or token(s) back and they also repaired the ride.   

A great place to be a kid indeed."}
{"text":"Brought my little love here several weekends ago and had a pretty good time. I don't feel like I'm reviewing this on his behalf. To start there is a jungle gym play area that he wanted to b-line for but first we ordered food. The food isn't that great and I remember thinking how overpriced the salad bar was. We went with a pizza combo pack. We claimed a table and went to play some games. 

There is a nice variety of games. They are split up into two areas really. One side is games to play and win tickets and the other is little rides and the little jungle gym and slide. The ticket games weren't to bad and we ended up with quite a bit of tickets. 400 I think. My boy liked the little rides and of course loved the jungle gym. There was also a machine that made cotton candy. It was good and the boy liked watching it being made. The toy selection for the tickets was pretty average. All the things at eye level with my boy were around 25 tickets. 

It was a fun time for my boy. Not so great for adults but that's something to be expected at a place like this. It is also dated. However it's a kids place and he had a great time and that's what matters most. It's also nice that  all children get a matching stamp to their parents so you can relax a bit and just let the kids play."}
{"text":"Is it possible to give more then two stars? Yes, surprising this location was very clean, salad bar was stocked no mess all over the counter, self serve soda station was clean. Now they have a reload card instead of carrying around those tokens, which is a plus."}
{"text":"This #CheckECheese is our to-go place because it is close to our house. No major  complaints or compliments here. This is your typical Chuck E. Cheese with a thousand kids running wild, as expected. 

Pros: The staff is fairly friendly, managers are always around, most games are functional and the food comes out quickly. Oh and it seems that they changed their pizza dough and supposedly it is very good. I didn't eat the pizza but the kids gave it thumbs up.

Cons: Its always busy when we go, kids need at least 1000 tickets to get anything worth it, ticket-to-token ratio sucks, and finally, don't get the wings ... they taste decent but they are miniature size #theworldsmallestwings.

All in all, your kids will have a blast at this place, which is what it is all about. I was torn between giving this place 3 or 4 stars so here's my unofficial 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Take your business else where , service is slow and there are several machines that are inoperable ."}
{"text":"We came for the lunch and to our surprise, hey had a buffet with a nice price to it. It was unlimited pizza and salad bar, but the salad bar was only the lettuce and croutons and dressings, nothing else. No biggie!
The missing star is that chuckie was suppose to come out on the half hour every hour. He came out the first time, he wasn't enthusiastic but still the kids got their free tickets. But an hour goes by, the announcement is made, because he announcement is a huge thing. \"Here comes chuck e cheese, he is coming out\" but low and behold, no mouse. Not even a \"sorry chick e cheese is not coming out this hour\". The song they are suppose to sing is playing and the whole time you see kids looking for the mouse. Well that sucked but at least they saw him the first hour we were there. 
My suggestion is that they fix some of their games, and remove their equipment from the lobby, as it makes a bad impression, at least for my family it did."}
{"text":"If I could mark zero I would because I never been here since I was a child. Not this particular one anyway, I don't even know where to start. The only reason I came in to take part in T-Mobile Tuesdays free personal pizza and not only did it take a while to get the pizza which I can understand since I think I heard one of the employees say the highest their number goes up to was 18 on a regular day and today I was number 67. It took about 30-45minutes to get the pizza. It's what I seen while I was waiting one there was a family at the salad bar I guess that's what it was getting ready to get a salad and I guess all of a sudden her foot started to itch so she rubbed it on her other leg but that didn't seem to work. So then she decided to kick her shoe off bend her foot up and scratch her foot with her hand while at the salad bar!!! Once done slipped her shoe back on and continued to get salad. That had to be the nastiest thing I've ever seen. No she didn't actually touch the food but she touch the utensil that everyone else has to touch to get their food. Than I witnessed something else, I thought a kid had escaped well it turns out that they have to stamp your hand or something before you leave. Well this family just left so the employee than had to run outside and catch them. Besides all of that the inside of the building looks like someone's dirty house and they decide to put in a bunch of toys and games so kids can come and play. There was a sign hanging out saying that the show starts every 30 minutes again I was in there for about 40 minutes give or take and the show did not start. It's almost like it was broken because it moved a little bit the light turned on the sound like they were trying to talk then it shut off and froze and that was it. The pizza that I received was so tiny if I had to pay for it let alone I got it for free I wouldn't of taken it. It's just because I had to wait so long I wasn't walking out the door with nothing. They had the nerve to cut that ugly thing in 6!!! WasWas it good? Surprisingly yes but it could've been better it wasn't the best. At least now I know not to take my kids here and to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"We love it here. Pizzas & sandwiches are good & staff is friendly. Always feels clean. Please fix ticket counter machine so there is more than 1 working."}
{"text":"Took the kids on a Saturday afternoon.  The food was average - the salad bar is a nice departure from just pizza and wings.  Unfortunately management apparently thought letting a group of 24 adults coming with no children was a good idea.  As they climbed into the same rides as the toddlers- not sure if the machines are made for that.  Worst part is they weren't being careful about their language around small children.  We will think twice before we ever come back to this location."}
{"text":"I did my time....but plenty of fun for kids. 
LOL,  I ordered A Beer and made it through. ..my son with the lil one's. ..had fun."}
{"text":"It needs a makeover -- the decor is gray and dreary. The play passes are a bit pricy. Games are out dated. Good Pizza -- Clean -- Plenty of Seating."}
{"text":"\"Chuck E Cheese's where a kid can be a kid\"...

PROS:  
Plenty of parking;
Chuck's pizza is still tasty;
staff was friendly

CONS:
Restrooms were pretty bad--only 3 stalls adults can only use 2 of them;
Restrooms were filthy!  No paper towels in either side of the dispenser and the vanity/sinks were a wreck;
The server's kinda put the food down anywhere, in fact one of our pizzas went to a table that wasn't even \"with\" us--these people just happened to be sitting near us.


This joint is okay, but really if the kid is any older than 5, it wouldn't be that awesome for them.  

I swear I remember Chuck E Cheese's being waaay cooler than it is now!

Anyhow, it was okay.
I've seen kids parties done better, but this wasn't the worst, by any means.

Would I use it for my kid?
Probably, because they take care of everything if you do \"booked birthday party\", so it really takes the party planning headache away from the parents.

PS:  I especially love the \"No Firearms Allowed\" sign @ the front door... *smh*


Its just a shame that *this* is the substitute for Showbiz PIzza Place :(
This could be such a cooler business/market if it were done right!
Think Shrek-esque.  FOR kids but with Parents in mind  ;)"}
{"text":"This place is nothing but a breeding ground for disease. The kids have a ton of fun in there but after playing all day they need to be power washed and degreased outside. We stopped here after visiting the rainforest on a Sunday and I'm pretty sure the rainforest was cleaner and held less bacteria. We choose to eat lunch at home instead of feasting on their pizza or salad bar which features lettuce that has been wilting for days. 

The only positive to our visit was how they checked every person out as they were leaving.  It appears that several parents take their kids there so they don't have to babysit. It was packed when we were there and there had to be at least 10 kids running around with no shoes or socks on. Gross! 

On a cold spring day there aren't a whole lot of options for the kids so we decided to go here. The kids love it but the place its dirty. It reminds me of a Walmart with games...."}
{"text":"I grew up in San Jose California where there still stands a 3 story Chuck E Cheese with full giant sized animatronics, a whole top floor of arcade machines and enough rides for about 20 kids to be on one at the same time.  None of these memories will my kids fondly remember.  If they remember anything at all it will probably be the time mommy almost had to bite her tongue from going vato loco on some absurd \"Green Valley has-been\" W.T. mom who was rude and vulgar after her daughter tried to steal something from our table.  From which the manager came in and completely ignored the fact that we were being discriminated against and took the anglo's side, of course.  Just a taste of the management from this location.

All that aside it is always crowded, even on weekdays.  The machines are rarely all working.  Even though there are maybe 20 games tops and about 8-10 kiddie rides for the toddlers.  You can expect this Chucks to be as HOOD as it gets.  Go to the one Eastern & 95.  Just believe me on this."}
{"text":"My kids are ages 11, 10 & 9 and they still love to come & play at chuckecheese. Coupons and deals are available at their website and if you sign up, you will get better deals directly to your email."}
{"text":"Pizza is everywhere in Las Vegas.  So I just want to say the pizza is actually pretty good. Do you really come to this place for the pizza?  Not really.  I come here because my 3 year loves it.  Her face lights up when with token in hand.  She wanders the layout of games and electronic buzzing and lights.  We always have a good time when we get to chuck E Cheese!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Lots of the machines were out of service. Some you had to swipe and use your card before discovering it wasn't going to work. The ticket muncher took a bunch of my son's tickets and wouldn't print anything out and of course the only person that could fix it was on break. Then with what tickets we had left tried to get a toy for my son and both things he wanted were out of stock even though they had several on display. My son left in tears on his birthday. We won't be back."}
{"text":"This Chuck e cheese is not as clean as lake mead. Today we went and about 45% of the rides and games were out of order.  I can understand if a few things are broke but when so many are broke my toddler gets bored and that sucks."}
{"text":"I am so surprised for a Thursday night the place is so dirty and and lots of the machines are out of service and or not working. It is disappointing since it is my daughter's bday and all she wanted to do for her bday is to go to Chuck e Cheese!"}
{"text":"Omg not clean the bathrooms and the customer service of manager's on duty .everything was find til my daughter had to use Bathroom my surprise filthly and smelly not what I  expected from a kid friendly place right .when you tell supervisor that bathrooms are dirty  and sends someone to clean it. But when you go again it still looks the same ."}
{"text":"We had a birthday party here today. We loved our hostess Halle. She took care of our party from start to finish. The manager even greeted us to check in. Everything turned out great. We had a two hour time limit. I would come here again. The party was a complete success."}
{"text":"My email to chuck e cheese: 

To start all the photo games were out of service, and I mean all. I think one of the funniest pets of coming here is getting a chuck e cheese picture. 

Secondly literally 5 games either ate our token or did not spit out the tickets we won. 

Plenty of other games were out of service like the little kid games. And 2 games we tried were jammed.

Being it was the end of the day and we had out 2 year old with us, speaking to a manager was not something I wanted to spend time on.

Thought I should send this so you can address this issue with management here. 

Not only this but getting to the prize counter we waited much to long to be treated by the women who had been standing there the entire time. 

I don't think we will be returning to this location. Hopefully these issues get fixed. Thank you for your time."}
{"text":"This chuck e cheese had the rudest manager I have ever encountered. I completely understand in forcing rules, but he got super rude and escalated the concern of us wanting to bring in decent adult food while the kids played."}
{"text":"I rate this Chuck E. Cheese A-ok because it serves it purpose of feeding and entertaining children while parents are nearby. Yes, the pizza is better elsewhere. Yes, it could use updated furniture and carpeting. Yes, the games and prizes are outrageous in price. But the kids that are running around making memories with their friends and family is what is important. I have no children so I only go here when there is an invite. I would say the staff was organized and kept everything neat and tidy in our party. The parents don't have to lift a finger at all for 2 hours of fun and excitement. Way to go Chuck, keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Two words for this place: money pit. Parents come here to spend money on their children, so there is no reason why they can't make this place cool if they put some effort into it. (Maybe make less ridiculous commercials and spend money investing in your product offerings.) Here are some highlights: 
1) the rides last for 15-20 seconds. (Then your kid starts screaming for more until you swipe your card again.) How about a ride that lasts 60 seconds? 
2) salad bar is disgusting. Products don't look fresh and variety is a joke. Jello mold doesn't count as a salad topping for me - sorry. 
3) $2.29 for a juice box (not even organic.) Come on. 
4) pizza is okay. I'm not expecting a culinary experience when I come here, but you can at least try to aim for dominos quality pizza. That would be acceptable (especially since you're charging $19 for a large pizza). 
5) the games could be better; more exciting than a slow moving train THAT I HAD TO PUSH to get it around the corners. 

Again, I don't mind spending money on my child, but I want her to have fun. 15 second slow lame rides are not amusing to even my 2 yr old. Seriously, stop being lame."}
{"text":"My wife and I were recently invited to this location by some friends and we had a great time. The place was kind of hectic, but that was expected. It's a kid-centric business, after all.

The pizza was quite good, having been cooked to a nice golden brown. The chicken wings (boned and boneless) were tasty, although a little on the spicy side. There were enough games there to keep both kids and adults entertained. The staff was very friendly.

I would have liked to see a better selection of classic arcade games. How about some Pac Man, Centipede and Asteroids? Also, I would have liked to see some of the parents do a better job of keeping their kids in line. 

Overall, we had a great time and we would happily come back again."}
{"text":"The pizza we got is super gross and the salad bar is dirty!   I guess if your taking your kids to have fun it doesn't really matter right?! My children had a lot of fun over there lol I suggest that you should eat before you get there so you kid can have fun and you won't have to full your tummy up with those disgusting food!"}
{"text":"My 5 year old son loves this place. Staffs was friendly, food was good. Very easy to talk to anyone there. Machines was good. Clean bathroom.  Weekly affair with my son. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I would give no stars but that is not an option.  I was in there on Monday at lunch time with my 4 year old grandson.  We ordered lunch, me the buffet (what a joke--pizza and salad?), I ordered chicken nuggets for my grandson the cashier Alexa asked if we wanted FRIES, I said yes, my sister ordered a wrap and FRIES, we waited over 40 minutes for the order and there were only a handful of people in there.  When we got it, the FRIEs which were hash brown nuggets were ice cold, the chicken nuggets were burnt.  I took it back up there and was told they are so sorry but they now serve hash brown nuggets not FRIEs, well then why did ALEXA ask if we wanted FRIEs?  They did not offer to reimburse me for any of the food we DID NOT EAT and sent back.  All that food was not home made and should never have taken 40 minutes to prepare.  When I told ALEXA I was going to write a review on YELP, she said, \"go ahead, have fun\", laughed at me and walked away.  What kind of customer service do you call this?  There is was a boy behind the counter also who just said, \"we don't have FRIEs\" even when I asked why she offered FRIEs to us?  This may not seem like a big deal, but I spent $28 in there and my grandson got nothing to eat as did my sister.  Instead of speaking to the two older gentlemen who were managers there, they chose to ridicule me and tell me to have fun writing a review.  Customer Service?  Is this the norm for Chuck E Cheese?  I am writing to corporate about this."}
{"text":"This place is always a dirty mess, BUT the kids just love it !! 

The pizza isn't bad either. We have been coming here for years, pizza was horrible years ago, we would always eat first and just come to play, but they have a new menu and pizza is a lot better. 

The birthday party package is good for kids & parents as well. The tables in front of the stage are always full of parties. 

As long as the kids have fun we will come. 

Still a dirty mess and constantly needs attention it never gets but we know that walking in the door"}
{"text":"My daughter and I were here for a birthday part on Saturday and I think we both had a blast! I've been here once before for a church activity and both times I've found the place to be very clean with friendly, helpful staff. While we were there I saw staff wipe down the machines on a number of occasions.  They've also really made things more parent friendly by using a swipe card system with various value deals such as bonus' and unlimited play for certain times. For the party we were at my daughter received a card that gave her unlimited plays for 2 hours. There isn't a full band anymore like in the 1980s and early 90s but they still have some music and a live Chuck E. Cheese who comes out to visit with the kids. 

About the food: The pizza is really, really good. Much better than I remembered as a kid. If I lived closer I would easily come here more often with the little one to pick up some lunch.

I was way more impressed with Chuck E. Cheese than I anticipated it. Definitely a pretty cool place to hang out with your younger kids for a couple of hours."}
{"text":"I love this place! I recently discovered that I still love this place just like I did as a kid. I like the fact that it has quarter games and it's never too crowded. I always get a coupon to get the credits/tokens and have a blast. This place has a much better selection than the other location so I always come here. 

I like playing skee-ball, basketball, deal or no deal, the shark whacking game, bee trap and a few others. I think this is an excellent buy for the skee-ball and deal or no deal because those games are now 75 cents each at Circus Circus! 

The machines almost always work which is a plus. Whenever there is a problem I can always find someone to help me. I haven't seen an out of order sign which is a huge plus. Unfortunately the machines don't calculate the points correctly (especially on the skee-ball) so you can never hit the bonus. I'm never too close to that score anyway but if I was I wouldn't be too happy. I've never had an issue with cleanliness or customer service. I'm not there long enough to use the restrooms so I can't comment on that. But I do love this place and will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Saturday, January 13th at 11:15 a.m.  The Chuck E Cheese Clown walked past a group of kids waiting to say hi.  I guess if you don't have a birthday you're a pleb and your money isn't worth a hello for your kids from the Clown.  Sad"}
{"text":"If I can give this place 0 starts, I would! Staff was very RUDE. Most game machines would eat our tokens, and some we're just out of order! When my children would let the staff know about their tokens being eaten, they would give an attitude. Most machines that did work would only give 2-5 tickets. The Salad bar was completely NOT WORTH IT for what you pay. Its upsetting to think you're going to a KID Friendly place, and you end up walking out disappointed. 
Never Again."}
{"text":"Still great!  Pizza was yummy. The kids love when Chucky Cheese comes out to visit and throws tickets too."}
{"text":"I was not very happy with this location. The bathrooms were a mess, toilets full, paper towels overflowing and on the floor. Almost all the games were now 2 tokens, and several were out of service and some would take your tokens and not give you the game play. When we went to cash in tickets every machine was out of service and we had to wait for an employee to reset them. We were there on a Monday evening from 7pm to 9pm and never saw Chuck E. Next time the kids want Chuck E Cheese we will be trying another location."}
{"text":"I'm actually here at this location currently it is 5:31pm we ordered our food at 4:27pm we never received our pizza or chicken for our salad bar . The staff was more worried about socializing with one another than actually tending to the customers . When I brought it to the manager \"John\" attention that we hadn't received I asked him \"why it has taken over an hour to prepare one pizza\" he then said he would \"check and let me know ASAP\" I never heard anything else from \"John\" nor did I ever receive my pizza that he assured me I would be recieving due to their lack of promptness until my 8 year old son complained that he never got his pizza . I will NEVER visit this location again . The ONLY pleasant thing about this visit was the cashier \"Gabby\" she was very sweet . Not to mention I'm 7 months pregnant , so I was very upset with not being able to have my pizza ! I would recommend visiting the Eastern location ."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service all around. Waited 10 minutes at register for someone to take our order. Waited 15 minutes to cash in ticket. Waited about 5 minutes for someone at counter to give us a to go box. All the staff looks like they are miserable, not friendly at all. All this on a Monday early afternoon. Not busy at all."}
{"text":"Good ol Chuck E. Cheese not much has changed since I was a kid. My daughter & her cousin had fun"}
{"text":"It was crazy in there! But then again it's for children to run around & have fun, sooooo yeah, it was crazy in there! I can say that when the machines stopped giving tickets as people actually won them, the staff was pretty quick to respond."}
{"text":"It is what it is. I had my daughter's Birthday Party here. Great pizza and salad for the adults. Plenty of games, tickets, and fun for the kids. And noise galore."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to check in and let the kids run wild, while the adults can wait at the table.

Things to note here are that the Pizza is VERY expensive unless you have a coupon.  If I was brave enough, I'd bring a $10 Costco pizza.  

However, the salad bar isn't a bad choice.

This is one of the better Chuck E Cheese places that I've visited.  For the most part the place is clean, the games are in good repair and the employees are friendly."}
{"text":"I have to say that while it has always scared me to think about bringing my kids here things have changed a lot. It's still extremely noisy but you have to expect that. It's still not cheap in anyway. But they now have much better food. The pizza was good. And most importantly they now sell beer. Nuff said."}
{"text":"I love this location the staff is very friendly  the pizza is delicious and i love that fact that they have wine & coffee i take my labtop do my school work since they have free wifi  and let my daughter enjoy her playtime with her friends."}
{"text":"PURSE STOLEN!!!!
My mom was sitting at a booth with her purse next to her and someone snatched her purse when she turned her back to watch my nephew 5 feet away at the ticket counter. How brazen this person was! We asked two different managers to view the surveillance tapes and interesting no cameras had a view of the booth she was sitting at. Another employee said her mothers iPhone was stolen there a week prior. This is either an employee who is stealing items or others who take advantage of parents being distracted by the commotion of all the kids.  
Do not bring anything valuable into this or any Chuck E Cheese, including children!"}
{"text":"Worst example of pizza I've ever had!! Games were dirty sticky and broken. I worked for a chuck e cheese in 2002 and they have went way down hill. Even those chuckie was altered and he looks like a RAT now not a mouse. I'm so disappointed because they really use to have great pizza with a garlic butter on the crust. Now it's a shitty deep dish knock off frozen pizza!!!"}
{"text":"The layout makes no sense. I know it's been an eternity since I've been to this chain, but I seem to recall the dining part away from the games. Not any more. If you order food you are surrounded at all times by screaming children (expected) and games that make every possible noise (annoying). I don't know how an employee could last more than a week.

Speaking of employees, they were great! Place was definitely understaffed. 

Pizza has been majorly improved, to the point that it can be called \"good\".

Assortment of games was good, but many were confusing, even for adults. Better directions (or any) would fix that. They have ticket self-scanners, so the parents have to do the work that the employees used to do. The selection of prizes is atrocious, by level."}
{"text":"My 3 year old son had tons of fun. There are plenty of games and rides for kids his age. Go during the week if you'd like to avoid large crowds. This location is very clean. We usually don't go for the food.. so if you're concerned about prices, eat somewhere else before or after! Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"They only had one person working in the front. Took forever to get our stamps, tokens and order for food. Then they were out of straws by the drink and out of ice. There was no one to be found for me to tell them they were out of straws and ice. Just not the best experience at this location."}
{"text":"Brought my toddler here on a Sunday for a little fun. Was supper busy due to birthdays. As soon as we walked in great customer service everyone polite and smiling every helpful. The place was clean, had few employees standby to clean table and floor. Food was tasty. The only bad was the games, some were broken or super slow in reconnecting after someone was done. The ticket machine kept breaking."}
{"text":"We were here Sunday and it was a treat for our kids. I was excited I knew they had all you can eat salad bar. We paid the extra $1.79 for chicken. So I asked where's the chicken told the lady our table number. She gave me my chicken. When I went back to get more salad asked for chicken the lady went to the back and came back with the same lady who gave me chicken the 1st time. As if I had done some type of crime. I asked do we only get it once? They look at me like duhhhh!! I have to pay another $1.79 if that was told to me at the time of purchase would of been fine. The menu only says additional $1.79. If you put this next to all you can eat I'm going to assume it includes chicken as well. Just bothers me these 2 young ladies look at a customer as if I'm robbing them for some damn chicken. Their response should of been I'm sorry we failed to let you know at the time of purchase. You do have to pay every time for additional chicken. It shouldn't be called all you can eat then. Customer service no bueno ladies! It's adults who bring our children to this place and we can't even enjoy salad here then it's sad to say I'd rather take my kids to Mc Donald's they will play for free. So for those who like chicken in their salad don't go here stop by at Sams Club to grab a whole already cooked rotisserie chicken save yourself the $1.79 over and over."}
{"text":"Staff is really friendly!

I really like the check in/ check out process they have going on here. 
Once you enter you and your child get stamped. This stamp is then checked again upon exit.  This lets you as a parent feel a little safer while your munchkin runs amok!

I usually come during the day and haven't encountered any large crowds. That being said, it's an enjoyable time here. 

They do have a lot of broken down games which is what brings the rating down some for me. I also which the pizza was the way it used to be when I was a kid!  $6 gets you a \"small\" pizza that is actually not with it."}
{"text":"I better start this by stating I don't have kids, so I don't go to Chuck E Cheese's a lot. In fact, even as a child I didn't go a lot. So my four stars may be based on that alone. Plus there is pizza. Awesome!

This past Mother's Day, I decided to treat my mom to an hour of skeeball (except she was a typical mom who had actual cash for the coin machine so I owe her). It was especially fun for my mom as she had never played skeeball and had definitely never played it to get tickets she could redeem for a prize. We were lucky -- turns out Mother's Day may be the least hectic day at this establishment (read: very few children). My mother had so much fun sharing and learning skeeball tips from the other moms and was as excited as a kid at...well...Chuck E Cheese's,that I think I may have found our new tradition. Also recommend this place for a date night - great way to learn how your significant other deals with competition and screaming children who may not follow social skills like waiting one's turn."}
{"text":"We had my son's 4th birthday party here today. It was lovely. Jessica the manager was very pleasant and Ricky our party host made sure we had everything I needed. Most important...the kids had a blast. I didn't have to clean up a thing and the parents had fun socializing while the kids went nuts. Overall a great and easy place to have a party."}
{"text":"groseros los que te atienden y la comida fria y muy caras las pizza y por $5.99+tax un pedacito de pizza de 4,plg eso es increible nunca mire una cosa tan descarada en mi vida; con ese dinero me compro 2 en walmart,  mis hijos que tienen autismo  dijeron mama todabia tengo hambre y como no entendieron les dije es que es para baby el pedacito"}
{"text":"They deserve three stars. Asking a 64-year-old man for his ID to buy a beer is absurd. I guess this is corporate America. The pizza is average. $49.95 plus tax will get you two large pizzas and four sodas. Why not throw in the salad bar instead of another $28 plus tax. It's pricy and understaffed. I remember 25 years ago when my children were young they offered pitchers of beer and the pizza was worse though. Chuck E. Cheese was available for photos. They give you plenty of tokens but not all the arcade machines work. Mr. Chuck E. Cheese made my little one cry it was her second birthday and she wasn't feeling well.  The employees didn't seem very happy."}
{"text":"Not happy. Came in at 3pm on a Sunday. It's clean. But waited 35 minutes for kids meal chicken nuggets and Churros. The chicken nuggets were tiny for $8.99!. The Churros were so crunchy  and over cooked they were awful. People in the next booth waited 51 minutes for a pizza."}
{"text":"I'm probably going to lose any and all credibility for even reviewing this place and risk being excommunicated from Yelp by stepping foot in this establishment, but I have to admit it's not a bad place to go if you have kids. Sure, being surrounded by screaming kids, animatronic mouses, arcade games, a guy in a mouse costume, and pimply-faced teen employees serving you food may be someone's idea of hell. But, for those of us that have kids it can be a good option for a family night out.

There's no question the food is one-star-quality at best. The pizza is light on sauce and the crust has a weird buttery/oily texture to it. The toppings, however, seemed relatively fresh (we got a vegetarian pizza). They also get points for offering a salad bar (even though we didn't try it) and sandwiches. They never had this many option when I was growing up.

This location is surprisingly well-maintained. It's cleaner than I thought it would be for the amount of traffic they get. I saw several employees roaming the room, constantly picking up and clearing tables. I also like how they stamp families as they enter and check them when they leave -- making sure you're leaving with the right kid. You have to give credit to any kid establishment that takes precaution against child abductions.

So, my overall 3 star rating might seem a little high, but any place that can make my son laugh, sing, dance, and have a great time is ok in my book. They have some 'rides' that my 2 year old loved and plenty of games for older kids too. They even have skee ball, which I haven't played in years. (full disclosure: I was awesome at skee ball back in the day... almost thought about turning professional. I was that good).

While this place isn't my idea of heaven, I can tolerate it just to see the smile on my son's face as the semi-operational animatronic Chuck E. belts out some tunes."}
{"text":"Not happy, some machines not working, machines out of tickets and staff members nowhere to be seen.  Had to stand by a machine for 25-30 mins waiting for tickets to be replenished after asking 3 times.  Such a disappointing experience and place.  3 staff members for the whole place (1 of which had to stay on the door the whole time so she can't really be counted) was all I saw in 1.5 hours and there were between 70-80 people in the room.  In school holidays this is totally unacceptable.  It's not worth the money (as most games have gone from 1 to 2 tokens now) and it is not worth the endless waiting (if you can find someone) for them to help."}
{"text":"Went with some friends and our 3 year olds. Hadn't been here since I was a kid. I was happy to see it has been nicely renovated and is nice and bright and cheery. The kids had a blast. The only issue I had was that I left my tokens on a machine for all of 2 minutes and another adult grabbed them, lame. I would definitely take the kids here again!"}
{"text":"We have been to this location numerous times since it opened with our twin toddlers. Although the food is not very good, the kids have a blast with the games and I love the safety factor here. Tonight was unique in that it took over an hour to get one large pizza. I honestly think they forgot our order because when I checked into when our pizza would be ready I was told they were short staffed and it would be a while. I told him we'd already waited an hour, so how much longer would it be...5 min or another hour? He said he didn't know, but it would be a while, I counted about 4 other families there and they all had their pizzas. After a few minutes I asked for a refund and we'd go somewhere else because our little guys were hungry and it was getting late. The manager told me to return our drink cups and dyed refund us. That was bizarre in itself. Ultimately we were told by the manager it would only be a few minutes so I said we'd wait. Then the original guy came up and gave us a refund for the cost of the pizza, after I said we'd wait. They ended up telling us to keep the refund for the pizza, but gave us the pizza a couple minutes later. I hope this doesn't happen again because we really like to bring our boys there, and gave spent a good amount there since they opened."}
{"text":"Two words...dirty and not well kept. Carpet needs to be stripped and arcade games requiring replacement. 

We totally miss the old breadsticks!!!"}
{"text":"Most of the machines are out of tickets and/or take your points ( used to be coins). We ordered food with a dessert pizza and the food never came out. The dessert pizza came out very burnt !!  Why dessert before the meal ? Definitely worth driving to another location. Total waist ! Staff was nice though."}
{"text":"I remember Chuck E.Cheese when ballpens were a thing and the whole crew would come out in full dress to amuse us and feed me pizza! Some changes have come down the timeline, like no more ballpens and more automation for the puppets. Chuck E. Cheese still serves it up though, and this location makes it great! The staff is friendly and accommodating. This may perhaps be the most important part of the experience considering its not the adults but the children that best be happy, though I do like to get down with some Spongebob Wack-a-Burger. 

With the game cards you pre-charge, $30 dollars goes a very long way, and games can be played constantly for an hour no problem. One of the staff members came by constantly and gave free gameplay for individuals which is both pretty cool and a thoughtful gesture. They have a decent sized play area as well, where Kids can climb in, up, around and down. Perfect for wearing them down for a nap."}
{"text":"I took my three year old on a daddy, daughter date here for some dinner and games. The food was fine, environment was decent, but my daughter had a blast and that's what made it all worth it."}
{"text":"Fun place for a child's birthday party. They really make the day special for the special birthday boy or girl. This is if you buy their birthday package. You get a helper who is there to help you. 
Expect to be surround by little kids and lots of noise. I felt though they didn't have as many fun games like they use to. Plus you hardly get any tickets after each game. Saturday's are busy so expect to have every table section filled with birthday parties."}
{"text":"We started off our night waiting and ended it waiting even longer.  It took about five minutes for someone to take our order, about 25 minutes to get the pizza, and about a half hour to get two plastic spiders.  When we asked the girl at the counter if anybody could help her she said everybody was busy.  This is after we watched the scrubbed out manager walk around with a clipboard for 10 minutes.  I appreciate that the staff kept the restaurant clean but a table could have been left dirty for 3 minutes to help out where they were needed most.  I now know to avoid this Chuck e cheese in the future."}
{"text":"On Tuesday night, cashier was slow; kitchen was slow; total chaos.
We were waiting for pizza, from 6 pm to 8:30 pm.
It is a miracle any business can survive with this kind of incompetence."}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars I would. This place is awful. Chuck e. Cheese has gone down hill so much. What kind of absolute bullshit is it that you can only have 2 beers per day. Who are you to tell me I can't have 3 or four beers while dealing with obnoxiously rambunctious kids. Then not to mention I can not have confetti for my daughter's birthday. That doesn't even tip the iceberg about the atrocious game selection. Are you kidding me? What kind of garbage selection of games do you offer. I will never be back to any Chuck e. Cheese again. Peter piper pizza will take all their business eventually. Please don't waste your time visiting this dump. I've had great experiences visiting the other location on grand canyon and lake mead. This establishment is horrible."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely horrible.  After waiting at the gate to get in we had to go find someone to take our order after patiently waiting we final got our order taken.  I should have known something was up but didn't want to disappoint the kid so we played games for an hour and I had to find someone and tell them what was going on to finally get my order.  The absolute worst service I have ever seen. It's not even busy.  I will never be back!"}
{"text":"I took my daughter here because she was swayed by the commericals and I agreed to it because I had fond memories of going to CEC when I was a kid.  However this place was horrible.  

I put a twenty into the token machine and when the tokens started coming out my daughter and I were suddenly mobbed by six or seven little grubby kids asking for tokens.  The one girl held up a dollar and said the other machine was broken so I assumed she wanted to buy some of our tokens.  I handed her four of our tokens and then she stuck her dollar back in her pocket.  Then she and the other kids started thrusting their hands into catcher full of tokens like crazed animals and some of them were actually tugging on my purse, I had to bring it around to the front of my person so they'd stop pawing it. 

My husband who was going to order pizza stopped ordering and came over because he said it looked like we were being mobbed.  When he asked what was going on I said, \"these kids are looking for free handouts.\"  They weren't really looking for handouts though, they were looking to steal all my tokens that I just bought for my daughter.  Their behavior was freaky and highly inappropriate.  If my kid acted that way I would implode.  So my husband and I just grabbed as many of the tokens as we could out of the little catcher and walked away.  They continued to buzz around the token machines probably harassing other people.  

The savory highlights:

The machines are dirty and don't work properly.
The staff is a bunch of teenagers who don't give a crap.
No effective security - kids can easily be stolen. 
Asshole parents who didn't watch their grubby little trolls.

We don't know about the food because I told my husband to not bother ordering, we got pizza later from Rocky's.  

So if you want to waste your money, get your purse stolen, get harassed by little scrubs, have your kid play with dirty, broken toys, this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"The kids love that place.
 the service is awesome, customer service excellent. good food. salad this terrific. pizza very good taste. will keep coming every time only because of the good service they have. thank you so much for a nice place to have at Summerlin.
We do recommend that place to anyone that likes to have a birthday party for their kids."}
{"text":"If you don't know what you're getting into by now, then just plain don't go. 
It's Chuck E. Cheese. 

Yes, it's loud.
Yes, the pizza is average at best.
Yes the staff was slow when we tried to cash in our tickets.
Yes when we leave, I am exhausted.

Yes, that is what I expected, and I wouldn't have it any other way.

My daughters have a blast whenever we go. They have been to Chuck E's for a few birthday parties, we've gone just to have fun. My daughters have fun, and bottom line, that's what it's all about for me. If they're happy. I'm happy.

And as an added bonus, kid's get tired out at Chuck E. Cheese. Which means no fights for naps or at bed time!"}
{"text":"Great place to take the family.  Would recommend this location for parties. Glen, the game attendant did a great job resolving the problem with one of the games."}
{"text":"I brought my kid here. All the staffs are very friendly and this place is very clean."}
{"text":"I planned my sons 9th Birthday here!! He was so excited! we went to a birthday party there and the hostess was amazing and we loved it so I called the next day and booked ours!i called the store and asked if I could request the same hostess Maria but was told she worked at a different location normally but promised we'd have the same experience. Then when I went t get the printable invites I couldn't so I went in the store again and spoke with the store manager and she said there was no way she could get me invites even though that is part of the package, so she gave me a deck of Chuck E. Cheese cards and I made my own invites. Then on the day of I get there and imagine my surprise when Maria (the hostess I requested) was there, but she wasn't my hostess, Alana was. She was horrible, she was rude and pushy, she brought the dipping dots before the pizza then served the kids pizza , while they were still eating she moved my sons pizza and set the cake in front of him and starting doing happy birthday and multiple guests told her that my husband and I weren't there and she needed to wait and she shrugged her shoulders and continued , I ran over and didn't even get to put all the candles on the cake, then she didn't even ask my son which slice he wanted and after he finished his pizza he asked me for a piece of cake and was upset that none of the characters pieces were  left, and it was HIS birthday!!! Then she thru away my salad plate I paid for and didn't even use, as she didn't tell anyone when she brought the food and some people didn't get to eat, including myself and my husband who paid for the party!! Then I was a goodie bag short! She rushed us the whole time and was very unhelpful and nice, especially when my son did the ticket blaster that he was so excited for and she didn't explain it to him and he got Hardly any tickets and she didn't wait for anyone to do it! So I spoke to Maria at the end and asked why they wouldn't let me have her as a hostess, as she was amazing! She said that she was no longer allowed to do parties and was put on probation due to someone at the my friends party Saying she gave free stuff away. I know they were referring to me as I spoke to the store manager about her when I requested her and I did not say that she gave free stuff away I said that she went above and beyond for them!I'm very upset as to how we were treated and how my son was treated being is we spent a ton of money and my intention was to have my other child's birthday there in July but I won't be doing that now this is very disappointing!"}
{"text":"If you were chained up in a basement you may not know what a Chuck E Cheese's is, but they have not changed much in 25+years. This one is clean and up to date but otherwise still the same old Chuck E Cheese's.

The Good:
One token per game.
Take destructive children here and abandon them.
They serve alcohol.

The Bad:
The games are 78% ticket based gambling machines.
There is nothing worth redeeming with this tickets.
The alcohol is awful beer and they have wine on tap. Somehow this is worse.
Pretty sure if you were to spend any real time here you could develop the plague.
The food is relatively expensive and below college quality.

Go here so you don't have to host a gaggle of destructive children, not for any other reason."}
{"text":"Just WOW! We get to the counter to order and there are three people standing there, one which was a manager, not one of them greeted us. Finally one of the gals said she could help us. We asked what size the medium is and she didn't know (not motivated to ask, but she's a kid). We ordered a medium pepperoni Pizza, 2 drinks and tokens. As we're waiting on the pizza were looking for a place to sit and almost every time table needed to be bussed. It was about 8pm so they weren't that busy and had plenty of staff. The carpet was full of food as well. Eventually, the pizza came out and it was fair to say it was tasteless and overcooked. I expected a little more since the location is fairly newer but this is just how they operate apparently. Very disappointing and have zero reason to go back."}
{"text":"erick the manager is so rude i called in for information and he straight out hung up on me. i will never ever come to this place, not worth it."}
{"text":"Perhaps my expectations where that of my younger days at Showbiz Pizza.  What a great time was had by all back then....ahhh the memories of the Rock-a-Fire Explosion band rocking the house while we ate pretty good pizza and played lots of games.  .  

Fast forward to last week and here is what you have....A staff who could care less, machines that don't work and/or out of tickets (the whole reason kids want to play them to collect tickets), a food quality that borders airline level of taste, and all of that equals 2 unhappy birthday kids and one very under impressed impressed uncle.  Wow is all I can say at how simply BAD this place is.  It was actually my birthday last week and since my niece and nephew have birthdays \"close enough\" we decided to celebrate all the birthdays while they were in town visiting.  

The first lady we encountered at the front door stamped our hands to keep us all together (this is about the only impressive thing here other than I saw kids under 5 running out the front door with no one checking their stamp so don't let that false sense of security put your mind at ease).  We then stood in line for nearly 20 mins to give them our money (hello first rule of business...) while I watched several other employees approach the cash registers but then walk away...ONE PERSON working the registers and a line out the door (well done chuck).  What appeared to be the manager was at the front counter but was too busy talking on her walkie talkie to care that the line was so long or to bother to assist in getting everyone in and paid so the line of anxious kids could go play.  I would have walked out after seeing this for a few minutes but thought...\"the kids are going to have fun right?\".  Me, the cool Uncle, not only ordered the largest token pack with the pizzas but then ordered another $50 in tokens to ensure the kids would have a great time.  This ended up being a huge mistake.  Out of 6 ski ball machines (which the uncle likes to play), only 1 worked fully.  Missing balls, ticket giver broken, just simply out of order with no sign saying so...and so begins the experience.  I must have put 15 tokens into ski ball machines to realize that they were broken except one (well done chuck).  Lots of machines there are all about winning tickets.  The kids started to focus on those...guess what...out of tickets (well done chuck).  After what seemed like a very long time (was only because the games were not giving the kids the stimulus they needed...hard to when they are broken or malfunctioning) the pizzas came.  I don't want to whine about overpriced pizza at an overpriced arcade, but wow was that bad.  Overcooked, not consistent, nuff said.  After we ate a couple pieces and realized that it was not very good we went back to play in hopes the ticket fairy had filled up the machines again.....ummmm not so much.  

We had not even begun to crack into the $50 token pile yet and we were done with Chuck.  I found ONE machine that was actually giving out tickets and then proceeded to dump all $50 worth of tokens into it just be done.  And thats when the next bit of fun happened.  

We approached the redemption counter behind a line of people (once again, ONE person working it).  We patiently waited our turn for the your lady who was working there (do you know hard it is to keep kids still and calm when its about prize redemption) just then another employee walked up and said \"Can I help you sir\" only it wasn't to me...it was to a guy who had just walked to to the counter.  The lady in front of me said \"excuse me but we have been waiting in line\" to which this young guy in a very rude tone said \"Mamn, you need to come over here\" with a look of disgust on his face.  I am not a violent guy but I wanted to throw that kid out of the front door when I heard him talk that way to a customer.  We finally got our $2 worth of prizes (well the best that $80 of tokens would get) and started to head out the door. 

This was a Wednesday night 7/9/15 at 5:20pm when we arrived (early on not a weekend) so what happened to these places??  My niece and nephew said...\"its ok uncle, lets just not go there again\" to which I said \"I could not agree more\" and finished the night off with some DQ ice cream which was the highlight of the evening.  

There are many others things we could have done on their birthdays (and mine) that would have cost much less and been much more fun.  Staff who don't care, machines that are not working, and bad food....what else can I say (you fail chuck). 

PS:  The Chuck E show is not even the band anymore....he's a freakin DJ now (how vegas) and even THAT was not working properly on this night."}
{"text":"Great place to take the kids, they burn off energy while snacking off decent pizza and wings. When the rides and games are working it's an awesome place. Staff has always been nice and helpful. Really like the security where they stamp you and your child's hand so no worry of your child wandering off with a stranger. Only reason I don't give it 5 stars is the fact on school days tons of teenagers who purchase nothing show up. Shouting profanity and knocking children over while horse playing. Couple I had to put in check because the staff ignored them. It's been a problem several times. Other than that my kids have fun so that's all that matters."}
{"text":"For a busy Saturday night there should be more than 2 out of 5 ticket redemption machines working. 1 out of 3 basketball machines working. Tickets not coming out of the machines. Tables dirty, we came at 700 they didnt clean the table behind me until about 830. First and last time here. I will say that the young lady that worked the couter taking your order was extremely pleasant."}
{"text":"Not just for little kids, I made a trip with the lady. They have beer for the big kids too. 
Lots of fun, though I wish they had more 'non-ticket' arcade games. 
Had an 'okay' appetizer, but not pizza. Hear the pizza is good, so will have to eventually try."}
{"text":"If you do not have kids = do not read this, as you may be extremely bored. Yes, I can't believe it, but I find myself reviewing a Chuck E. Cheese. So I asked my kids where would you like to go - 3D mini golf, roller skating or Chuck E. Cheese. Turned out to be a silly question. There was a deafening \"Chuck E. Cheese!!!!\" as an answer. For some reason kids just love this place. They have a dedicated person at the entrance who assigns a stamp that can be seen with a black light with a specifiic number for all your family members - check in together - check out together. There's a section for younger kids and one for older kids (not a place for teenagers though). It was very clean including the bathrooms. They have quite a few employees that were all very genuinely friendly and seem to like kids. Chuck E. made an appearance (yes, even I got a high five); he was throwing tickets in the air, like he was making it rain hundred dolla bills ya'll. Kids were scrambling and even parents down on their knees (I was not one of them) grabbing for tickets. My kids love trading their tickets in for candy and toys; they feel all grown up making their own decisions. As everyone in the free world knows, they do birthday parties and have pizza. Their salad bar and pizza looked okay, but the food snob in me just can't bring myself to eat there. My kids had a blast and actually thanked me for bringing them. And best of all, the cost was $10 worth of tokens."}
{"text":"If I could I'd give it a big fat 0 but it isn't allowed!! 4th Birthday Party from hell, do not come here. Hostess 'for food order for 21 people, 2 people had money stolen out of handbags restaurant ran out of ice list goes on and on. Had to remind them to bring out the dang birthday cake at 7:30pm, our reservation was 5-7:30pm!!  Manager tried to make nice by giving us 'salad bar' for free. Big deal."}
{"text":"Possibly the smallest Chuck e Cheese in the country.  The place is not well kept up, dimly lit and at least 3 machines were not working.  The upside is that this is a great place to let your kid feed coins into the machines and not break the bank.  Most machines only take one coin so it keeps them busy for a while.

The place itself is a bit hard to find which makes for less traffic and easy parking in the lot, which in Madison is never a given.  My preschooler and I disagree on the quality of the food.  Obviously not a five star unless you are under the age of 5, then it rivals high end New York restaurants.  

If it's raining or cold out and you have to get the kids out of your hair, it is affordable and relatively safe.  And they serve beer, thankfully, to ease the suffering."}
{"text":"I threw my nephew his 5th birthday party at Chuck E. Cheese.  He had an absolute blast and we wound up there for two hours after the party ended because he and some of his friends were having such a good time.

The process to book a party on their website is extremely simple and I received a 120 token bonus for booking online.  I was pleasantly surprised that they only charged me a $50 deposit instead of charging me for the full cost of my party.  

The party package I picked came with plastic cups with curly straws for the kids and paper cups for the adults.  I would recommend bringing labels and a Sharpie to mark the cups because we had a difficult time keeping track of whose cup was whose and our hostess was unable to help.  We actually didn't see much of her throughout the event, but she was pleasant when she did come over.  She was subtle to mention that tips were appreciated, but I was irritated that you cannot add the tip to your credit card when you pay, you have to give it to the hostess in cash, so keep that in mind.  

I'm glad we chose to bring our cake (the only outside food allowed) because their cakes were pretty dinky looking.  The pizza was edible, but unmemorable, the veggie tray overpriced, but tasted fresh, and the cheesy bread was terrible.  Food took forever to come out and even though I spoke with the manager about one of our guests having a severe allergy to corn prior to the event (there is corn starch in all their bread and breaded products (pizza, wings, etc.), we had an issue ordering the special items we had discussed.   

The big disappointment of the day was that there were so many broken games.  Only one of the skeeball machines worked.  The balls were deflated on the football toss game.  There was no mallet on Whack a Mole. Those were some the games you didn't know sucked until you wasted your tokens, many other games just had Out of Order signs posted on them.  The games are the main reason to go to Chuck E. Cheese, so this was a bit frustrating.  Even with all the broken games, the kids starting with 80 tokens each, plus the 120 bonus, we still spent about an additional $100 in tokens.   

Another issue was that there was no soap or paper towels in the ladies room.  When I told a staff member, she advised that someone would get in there as soon 'as they had a chance', but when another mom in our group went in a half hour later they still had not been replenished.  
Keeping with the unclean theme, the brewed iced tea had a really disgusting dirty taste, and the Diet Pepsi was pretty terrible as well.  I stuck with the bottled water I brought with me.

Overall, I would host another party here if the child Really wanted to go to Chuck E, Cheese, but I'd make sure I had Purell and a beverage."}
{"text":"Booked my sons 1st birthday at this location, the area is nice and spacious tons of games to play. There is a toddler zone which even my son had fun within.

Met with Kais our party host who was fantastic brought all the food out on time no issues at all.

End of the day all the kids were happy and the Adults had fun as well."}
{"text":"Over an hour for one pizza? 

It wasn't busy. I went up after 45 minutes to ask for an update and was told \"we can put it in the oven now\".  

Server dropped the pizza on the table and said \"here\".  Employees were not friendly."}
{"text":"Chuck has done a fantastic job over the past few years cleaning up this location! When I first walked in I immediately recognized the transformation. With goofy smiles the staff was working diligently to maintain the cleanliness.  It was like the smiles were mandatory or maybe glued on.  Very friendly staff. 

One star off for the food.  The pizza was awful.  It's called Chuck E.  Cheese.  There was little cheese and no sauce.  It was cardbord with a spritzing of cheese on top.  Yuck.  Thankfully we passed on the salad bar.     It looked beat up and the lettuce was wilting.  We really didn't come for a superior meal - it's about the entertainment... right Chuck? 

Another star off for the fact that while the team was working hard they were also working hard to limit their workload.  Half of the tables were marked 'reserved'.  These were ALL the tables in the stage room.  Part of the experience is eating your crummy meal while watching a hastily made animatronic/video show.  Your can't do that when all the tables in the vacinity of the stage are mysteriously reserved. 

Eat somewhere else then pop in to play a few games...  Your kids won't mind and Chuck won't care."}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday late afternoon thinking it would be better serviced. I had a party of 9 & they messed up the order. I asked for 2 extra large pizzas & they brought large. And girl charged for extra wings when I had asked for the family platter. Then when i asked for my money back the cashier refused until manager agreed with me. Salad bar was disgusting. Would've been better off going to a clean friendly service cicis. Wouldn't even rate for 1 star. Total rip off."}
{"text":"Chuck E. Cheese is a must visit place if you have small or older children.  I have been here twice now at two separate occasions and I've experienced similar service both times.  My review is based wholly on two parts:

1) Food - Great food despite the fact it's main business is video game entertainment.  The pizza was delicious as was the salad bar.  Very fresh and just enough to make you say wow.  Seriously I would rate there pizza better than Papa John's or Pizza Hut.  However, the wait time for food is astocious!  Seriously we waited almost an hour to get our food (two separate locations experienced similar wait times both times).  Had to ask at least 3 times where my food was and just waited forever.  Perhaps disclose wait times before you order?!

2) Games - Pretty nice selection of games and good ticketing system for some cool prizes.  Everything actually works that was available to play.  A few games had \"out of order\" signs on them but nothing you'd die to play anyway.  They're also very generous with tokens if you happen to get a deal meal thing.  I would have like to see more of the party dining area utilized for more games, but that's just my opinion.

Overall I gave it a 3 star because of the wait times for food and the fact they let hoodlums loiter in front of there establishment.  I was approached by two different vagrants asking for money and there was a group of teenagers smoking by the front of the door.  Just gives off the wrong image.  Will probably come back."}
{"text":"I remember coming here as a kid and playing in the ball pit, yeah they don't have that anymore because of sanitary issues.  I went here this weekend for my friend's son's third birthday, it is still a great place for kids, but it can get expensive.  There is no avoiding it though; your kids will beg you to come here.  I am not sure if they serve beer here, because I decided to keep it clean in front of mixed company.  It just seemed so much bigger here when I was younger, but I'm 6'3\" now and everything seems to shrink."}
{"text":"The management there has no professionalism at all. My sister was injured and he acted like he didn't even care when we told him what had happened. He wouldn't even get the information from the family that had caused the issue and only took my sisters info. I will no longer be going to this location and depending on what happens I may not patronize any of the locations."}
{"text":"Chuck E Cheese....not for the faint of heart.  It's a mad house at these places and this one is right in line with that line of thinking.  Thank God they serve beer (even though you can only have 2 small ones and only 1 within an hour).  But the real reason you come here obviously is for the kids and kids love tokens and they love those little tickets.  Oh, and forget about the food, ugh, nasty.  If you are lucky enough to drop $50 and get 100 tickets you too can have a pencil sharpner, 4 stickers and a mini slinky. :)"}
{"text":"This was a horrible experience.  Took 44 minutes for food. Tables were dirty and Chucky was no energy didn't engage with the children at all. Looks like Peter Piper from now on.  Oh yeah ticket splash 20 tickets really"}
{"text":"Walked in and the place smelled like....not pizza, but urine. All those pizzas they turn out, and all we can smell is urine. Keep in mind, fresh urine has a smell, but this was the stench of uric acid being heavily tied into the fibers of the carpet. When we brought it to the manager's attention, she acknowledged the smell, and that was the end of the conversation. Wow. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"i live walking distance from this location I'm a regular here. I bring my son all the time.
GABBY deserved to be getting paid triple of what she's getting paid now. She's really nice, she always seems to be doing 3 peoples jobs, & on top of that she always has a smile on her face. I seen her in the front taking orders, at the salad bar, the toy area, cleaning up etc...
She always has a smile on her face!"}
{"text":"i am exceptionally disappointed. since our family eats a very restrictive diet it's impossible for us to 'plan' a birthday party for chuck e cheese, but we decided to bring our 5 and 6 year old for games as part of the 5 year olds birthday day.

most of the tables were filthy, garbage and food was everywhere on the floor. but the bulk of my complaints come from the games.

the games regularly ate our tokens, many of the games failed to dispense tickets and several actually ran out as it was dispensing. we used the ticket counting machines when we were ready to leave, i inserted 10 tickets, it gave me credit for 1!

i was looking for staff out on the floor to assist with the machines, but no one could be found. the people at the counter couldn't be bothered with complaints about the games.

the prizes are cheap garbage, but for the age of my kids it's exciting to win things. i wish it could have been a better experience for them."}
{"text":"This place is awesome for kids! And fun for parents too. I admit I can last about 2-3 hours and then I need my nice quiet place. We stopped yesterday and had their all-you-can-eat pizza buffet- great deal. While the kids played games, I had a beer and played Pokemon for a couple hours. ( It's a poke stop! )"}
{"text":"Staple in my household for six years now....We have had a birthday party there for at least one of my kids for the last six years.  This is the first year were it wasn't there package party in five years.  If you sign up for their emails, you can get great coupons. Then you can pop in for sodas and games.  Honestly, the pizza did get better.  It's not Pizza Hut, but not as yucky as it used to be!"}
{"text":"I would never recommend Chuck E Cheese at 7381 Lake Mead, Las Vegas NV. I just had my son's birthday party at Chuck E Cheese and it was so disorganized. I hope that my guests did not realize it. 

The party hostess was friendly at first, she got our orders for the kids pizza and adult pizzas. She said, okay i have that you are having 14 kids. I looked at her with a startled expression and said, no I am having 20 kids. She looked at the plates on the table and was like \"oh I guess I could of looked at all those plates\". I was like, what have I got myself into. There were clearly 20 plates on the table, but she didn't have the correct information. 

I never saw the party hostess around until the manager saw me getting my own pitchers and I asked for more plates. I had to fill up my own pitchers after they were empty. The tables weren't cleaned off to the very end. I was surprised the cake was ready for the \"Big Chuck E Cheese\" show. The other \"party host / hostess\" seemed more attentive to their guests vs. my party hostess. I am not sure if she just didn't care or if she was overwhelmed with the 20 + kids we had. I have had my kid's birthday parties at other facilities (Child's Play, Laser Tag, Sky zone etc) and those experiences were wonderful.  The other party host at (Child's Play, Laser Tag, Sky zone, etc) were always around or if they needed to go on break there was always someone else around. Another thing was the \"ticket blaster\", she never explained the ticket blaster, that my son FINALLY went in. She said, oh did he already do the ticket blaster and I was like no I was waiting for you. She said, oh that (and she pointed) party host is doing the ticket blaster. By that time, I just gave up on the party host. I took my son to the other hostess who was wonderful. i always give a $50.00 tip to my party hostess/host but she received a $10.00. I don't even think she deserved that. 

The only thing she seemed to be on top of was handing me the bill. 

I would never recommend Chuck E Cheese on Lake Mead in La's Vegas."}
{"text":"We had my daughters birthday there last Saturday - 12 kids and about 12 adults.

The Manager Manny was a nice guy.  He was very helpful.  Our hostess was Brianna; she did a good job.

The place is well used; it looks like the carpet should have been replaced months ago.  I am a little leery of walking on it, let alone allowing my kids to run around and fall on it.

They did a good job with the party; I feel I got my moneys worth I just wish the place was maintained better; I think the staff is doing the best they can with what they go but the Company needs to spend some money maintaining the place."}
{"text":"Best of the best Chuckee's around.   A lot cleaner,  friendlier staff, more games than its counterpart in North Charlotte.  My girls had a ball and enjoyed the variety.  They had appropriate aged game for multiple kids' ages. I think I even saw some grown ups playing games. 

Counter person was friendly and even spoke to my girls. Nice pleasant touch. You would be surprised how few people do not speak to children when they work at kid themed venue. 

One wish for improvement would be food service level. We just ordered pizza and cheese bread. It took awhile to get it. Great time for kids to play, but not so much  for parents who were starving.  

Overall, nice outing in a nice area of town. Great Friday evening activity."}
{"text":"Children love Chuckee Cheese after like 25 + years of being around. My daughter had a playdate here today and she had a ball! 

Everything was super cleaned and salad bar was fresh. Also, even though they didn't have many workers during the day, we still were serviced quickly when getting tokens & food. Plus, there's always games for younger toddler age kids and older children. 

We ended up staying in there for almost 3 hours. 

Convenient location in Concord, too. Near Concord Mills."}
{"text":"Worst place rude workers!! The have only one person to each counter and they just take their time and have a sassy attitude. When there is more people needed they never have any. The tables are filthy no one is out on the floor cleaning. I had to clean my own table the old location was better than this one. You think in a new place they would have more improvements to the staff."}
{"text":"Ok, so this place isn't really for adults (unless you frequent the one with the Initial D simulation car..yeah!) but I know most of you have had to go to one for a birthday party or been dragged here by your kids!  I know I have!  I really don't like going to Chuck's all that often, the place is always packed!  Plus there's a big rat running around and scaring the bejeebus out of all the kids!  Ha Ha!

I have no clue why everyone loves bringing their kids here for a birthday party.  Do you not love your kid that much?  You like scarring them for life with life-size animated rodents?  My parents took me here when I was a kid and I swear it's the reason I'm scared of clowns to this day.  That and the fact I watched the entire mini-series of 'It' on TV probably didn't help either.  Poor John Ritter!  I would have stuck with Three's Company.

But it turns out now that I'm a parental figure I did the same damn thing to my kid.  \"It's your birthday soon!  Do you wanna have it at Chuck E. Cheese?  Yay!\"  I figured out it was because I was too lazy to do an entire party myself!  No wonder!  They take care of the kids, fill them up with carbs and endless refined sugar, bribe them with tokens and tickets, freak them out with a robotic singing rodent band that goes on endless loop, and freak them out even more by making them follow a big rat that tosses out free tickets and sings 'Happy Birthday'.  Top that off by giving parents the option of having beer or wine from tap, and an endless salad bar!  Crazy!  The entire family is screwed into braindead entertainment!  Which leaves Chuck running his rat-A$$ all the way to the bank.  Genius, I tell you, genius.  In the words of famous orator Adam Levine, \"I wake up feeling satisfied but guilty as Hell.\"  I am a bad, bad dad.  I don't know why I put my child through this debacle.

Could it be because of the many, many coupons Chuck E. Cheese offers to lure you into their rat trap?  Could it be because of the temptation of having someone else handle your kids for a few precious hours so you can catch a break?  But how is it really a break if you're not allowed to leave the premises without your kid in tow?  I'm looking at you, the guy that stamps our hands at the entrance!  It's like kiddie branding cattle!   

Don't get me started on the food and the prizes!  Their new and 'improved' pizza is marginally edible, and their wings are so-so.  I mean, I can make a better pizza using a DiGiorno box and a toaster oven.  The birthday cake, which is as dry as the Kalahari desert.  And yet, I am enamored by the endless supply of Mello Yello you allow me to throw down my gullet.  Damn my love for Mello Yello!  And of course, there is the all-you-can-eat salad bar.  Which to my chagrin, is fairly stocked with decent fresh fixings.  

Prizes for tickets?!  Is it just me or is this the biggest scam EVER?!  I can go to the 99 Cent Store and get most of these prizes that Chuck offers for pennies!  It's ridiculous!  10 tickets for a Tootsie Roll!  100 tickets for crap my kid will never play with again after we leave!  1000 tickets for a stuffed animal I can get from crane machine for $1 at my local Denny's!  I can't even begin to tell you how many extra tokens you have to buy to get 1000 tickets!  Why oh why did I traumatize my child for life?

Yet, at the end of the day when I see kids (including mine) run up to their parents to hug them and say, \"Thanks for the bestest birtday party ever!\" For a brief moment, we are superheroes in a world of kiddie chaos.  I see how Chuck keeps luring them in.  His evil master plan!  A child's love!  For all the noise, the lacking food, and the excess dollars spent...I fear I will be back here again sometime soon.  Just not too soon I hope!"}

{"text":"I think I might be a bit forgiving in the star rating here since the kids have fun despite all the issues. 
Right off we stood in line for ages! They were under staffed and it was her first time on the cash register. The manager should have been backing her up. Then she messed up our transaction. Ugh!
Shortly after Chucky comes out to dance with the kids and his nose is falling off! It was pretty disturbing.
As usual too many games malfunction taking your tokens. 
The pizza is a gets as you'd expect and the over priced salad bar is not really work paying for. 
At the end of the evening the ticket eater that counts your tickets want working. All three weren't working correctly. It was very frustrating! 
This place is in serious need of better management. 
If you are there till closing make sure to get your tickets counted quick because the machines shit down while your trying to finish up. 
The kids do not know how over priced it is nor any of this other issues and they had a great time. But we are the ones that endure, pay and drive them there so...
Not a great location but u don't know if a better one to suggest either. :-/"}
{"text":"Most of the games do not work a lot of the ones that accept coins are jammed you have to get a game technician to either help you which they usually won't unless it's Xavier and then you have to get a minute so this is the worst Pizza Swamp experience we have yet to encounter most games are broken or don't work"}
{"text":"Our 3 year old absolutely loves it and we like it because the pizza is not bad and the salad bar is better than one would expect. Every game is only one token, so you don't have to spend a fortune for your little one to play a lot of games."}
{"text":"We've been here before but they now have a Wednesday deal which is fantastic! All you can play for 1hr.  It works and the kids have fun without spending too much time nor money.  We're having a great time here!  Always plenty of parking too.  The staff was friendlier than usual which was a plus.  We'll be back..."}
{"text":"Came here on Sunday morning at 10am when they first opened. The place smelled like feet and idk what else. My son and I haven't been here in months (we've been going to the midway at circus circus). They've upped the price to 2 coins per game. 
This price would be okay if the games actually gave out decent tickets. My son and I were only getting like 5 tickets out of each game. That doesn't add up at all...
The prizes cost a lot of tickets too. I had to put more money with my tickets to get him a small angry bird car. 

We'll stick to circus circus where there are a ton more games and it's way more fun."}
{"text":"I used to like taking my kids here but now it seem way over priced and half the machines take your coins or don't give tickets. The fact they upped the game tokens to 2 per game is just ridiculous! The prizes for the tickets are also beyond ridiculous and not even worth it. The food is still average but all in all what it cost to go here is way over priced for what is given."}
{"text":"I would think twice before booking a kid's birthday party here. We booked on a weekday in hopes of avoiding the weekend madness, no such luck with this particular Chuck E. Cheese. The service was terrible. To say the service was slow would be an understatement. The orders were also wrong. And to top it off, a bunch of the rides for the smaller tykes were broken. Finally, there was a small group of kids and a young adult were stealing the basketballs for a skill shooting game and shooting from across the room, creating a risk to other little kids- with no intervention whatsoever from am employee."}
{"text":"Went on a Tuesday for lunch my son had a good time and is very clean 
The pizza was ok 
Stay for about two hours"}
{"text":"Would not recommend! We came here for a birthday party and brought my two other kids. Since they weren't part of the party we decided to order our own pizza. As were standing in line at the register there's an employee in front of us ordering a large order for a birthday party she is hosting for. We wait patiently and as she finishes up another employee cuts in front of us (and now the line forming behind us) and begins placing another large order! 

So I said something about how we've been waiting and now they finally tell me, oh this register is only for employees to put in party orders! Really!! You couldn't have said that before! How am I supposed to know that, there was no sign saying that! 

So I change registers and wait in line again and order a large pizza tokens and a drink. We get delivered a medium pizza and are in the process of eating it and commenting on how small the large pizza is when an employee walks by with a larger pizza. I ask her what size that is and she says large!

So I take half of the medium pizza back up to the counter with my receipt and they confirm they did make me a medium not a large. They said they'd make us a new one. 

So as the birthday party is wrapping up our large pizza arrives (2 hrs after we initially ordered) and the pizza is over cooked. Fantastic. We choke down a few bites and take the rest to go. 

There was one positive, the kids seemed to have fun playing the games, however the whole experience was ruined because everyone was hungry the whole time. 

Just wanted to share my experience. We'll be going to Peter piper next time."}
{"text":"I really want to thank Ruby for her excellent service the whole time we were there. Place was very clean and pizza was served in a timely manner. We all had a great time! Thanks everyone!"}
{"text":"I wasnt thrilled about the cards, but like anything new, it is something to get used to. This location is full of smiling hustlers and hard workers, George especially. Gabby was very sweet and smiled when helping all guests. George kept the tables neat and clean and games wiped down. They pick up trash consistently. They are a bunch of really great workers including the nice gentlemen we encountered who were testing all of the games, Chris. He was really awesome and was throwing around long strings of tickets for the kids. The staff really made the kids happy. It was awesome. A gentleman, Alberto, who served my beer was very pleasant to deal with, and seemed like a great team leader. Come to find he was management and I see he deserves it. Thank you to our favorite Las Vegas CEC for having amazing staff!! Staff like this place keeps peope like us coming back. Come visit!!"}
{"text":"I love bringing my kids here this place just needs a little bit more of improvement. Most of the time the games are not working,and i think they should have better deals as far as getting food."}
{"text":"Took my kids here on a Saturday morning and it was a good experience. It wasn't too busy and the pizza was pretty good.This is my first time going since they got rid of tokens, and it was way more convenient because you don't have to carry a pocket full of change. Most of the games were actually functional. One thing I remember about Chuck-E-Cheese over the years is the games were always in bad shape and took your token and you had to go complain to the attendant to get your token back. That would happen many times per visit, but with the play points I think that's solved.

I can suggest to anybody planning a visit here to bring some singles along with whatever larger bills you're going to use to buy Play points. Because it kept asking to double the Play points for $1 or $2 more and I ended up using my debit card. I brought cash to buy Play points with but since I didn't have singles I used debit. So it was like 40 points for 10 or 80 for 12. How can you pass up a deal like that? I wish that I would have brought singles."}
{"text":"This place never gets old! My kids love it! We load up on coins and let them have at it! Even my one year old was having a blast, I had to keep up with her. Her favorite game is the moving car with photo and rolling the balls up that thing. Never knew the name of that game :s
I loved this place as a kid and will continue!"}
{"text":"I was a little hesitant coming here when I saw a posted picture of a disgusting toilet someone else pointed for their review but my 3 year old son kept begging me because of their non stop ads they keep repeating on tv. So I talked myself into it and said maybe they were just having a bad day. We went during their buffet hour which offered hard and dry pizza not even pepperoni or cheese was available but I decided to wait 30 minutes for it. My son and I played lots of games which he enjoyed but then since I was pregnant I had to use the restroom. I tried to hold it as much as I can because I was scared to see what I saw on their previous review in regards to their dirty toilets and was afraid I'd regret eating there but the baby was pressing on my bladder and I tried to affirm with myself again that maybe it was just that day but when I came in the bathroom was the dirtiest bathroom I ever walked in and every stall had shit in and on it. I all of a sudden cringed at my decision and started wondering if their kitchen was just as bad. I mean I saw an employee just leave their bathroom and I knew she had to seen it but obviously she didn't care. I'm not using it so I politely told one of the other employees of the situation and she immediately went to try to rectify the situation but when I went in their after she claimed she cleaned it all she did was flush the toilets but their was still poop on the seats. She didn't clean anything! Filthy and I was so sad. I really was. I'm never going back. I'm sorry I wish I didn't have to write such a nasty review but if they were clean I wouldn't have to."}
{"text":"Brought my little brother and my family for his 7th birthday and it was his first time being there. I honestly don't recommend bringing the family here if you want to sit down and eat. When we first walked through the doors we all got our stamps then went to order our food right away the girl who took our order was extremely disrespectful walking away as I was ordering and every time one of her co-workers walked behind her she would start conversations with them, I'm not normally the type of person to be rude to anyone in fast food/restaurant service because I know how it feels from past jobs but this girl really needs some more training or something. We had bought 3 salad plates and 2 pizzas, the salad plates are a decent size you could say but I honestly think it's so dumb that you can only go up once and then you're done or you have to pay all over again. As I took my little brother to claim a prize from all his tickets the same girl that took our order helped us pick a prize and this time when she saw us walking up she didn't even acknowledge us she was texting for a good 10 minuets on her phone and kept rushing us every time my little brother was trying to look for a prize that he wanted. I get it's hard working in food business but come on you literally are with kids all day be a little more respectful or quit your damn job it's as simple as that."}
{"text":"So I was there on Friday and it wasn't super busy. We sat in the booths by the birthday parties so my niece can see Chuckie better. We had just got our pizza when a worker came over and asked us to move so she can clean up for tomorrow before they close (it was 6:30) I said we just started eating and she said sorry but you have to move I said no we were going to eat first, she said okay fine but don't make a mess. We moved after our pizza and I never saw the girl go back over there so what was the point. Kind of rude. It did look like they've cleaned the place since the last time I was there"}
{"text":"Of the 4 C.C in the Cleveland area this is the best one.  I know Chuckies are obnoxious, chaotic and germy.  Get off your uppity high horse and hear me out.  Sometimes its raining, the park closest to your house is being raided due to guys meeting off Grinder there or it's typical Cleveland with 2ft of snow on the ground.  The employees are nice but slow as hell.  Takes forever to get tokens and  cash in your tickets for cheap junk at the counter.  They sell beer.  Christmas Ale and Oktoberfest on my last trip.  If that doesn't take the edge off I don't know what does.  They always have great coupons emailed to me and birthday ticket vouchers too.  Let the lil bastids run like a freak for an hour, have a beer and just Purell your hands on the way out.  Cheap and fun..."}
{"text":"The staff at this location was pretty good. The manager was very kind, I didn't realize they changed the price of tokens from .25 cents each to .33 cents each, the manager credited me the 20 tokens anyway. 
The salad for the buffet was also good, they had stuff for a Cesar salad as well as a regular salad with cherry tomatoes, cucumber and carrots. Again the manager was quick to fill the salad with additional cucumber and tomatoes when they were out. I prefer the location on Grand Canyon because it is less crowded and a lil cleaner, but will definitely come here again because of the friendly staff!"}
{"text":"We typically come to Chuck E Cheese during the week for the lunch buffet. There is a $1 coupon on their website, so after that the buffet is only $5!  For a stay at home mom with limited funds, this is a great place to spend time on these very hot Vegas days. I can get $5 in tokens and my kid is happy.
The staff is alway friendly and accommodating. They will take special request for pizza during the buffet even. THe salad is decent usually has romaine lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers and carrots. Not bad for $5!"}
{"text":"Service slow as usual specially on week ends. This is the first place we've ever been served COLD buffalo chicken wings! We told the server about this. Waited for 30 minutes, still no wings. Second reminder did not do any good. Money refunded, so disappointed. Not going back anymore."}
{"text":"Weekly visit with grandchildren, best location ever.  Clean, good food and great rides/games!  Can't go wrong here"}
{"text":"4 stars because I am a Fan. 
Why? We've never had the problems like the other Yelpers have seem to run into and I used to bring the kid to CEC just to play so I could study. 

Most recently, I booked a party online and it was executed pretty good by the staff. Some of the invitees didn't show so we had to reduce the numbers & learned of their policy but they worked with us. I can't control how tweens perceive this place but they stayed away for whatever reason. Regardless, they offer the following: 
1) Beer - I remember when I heard this a few years back and about died. 
2) Wings
3) Sandwiches and healthy fruit and vegetables as an alternative to all the candy & pizza
4) The SALAD BAR IS THE BOMB!!! I didn't use to eat salad but CEC salad bar made me pay attention to things can be better. Well, this day proved no different... still fresh, still a good variety. 

NO WI-FI but the two neighbors have a signal strength that can be picked up. 

5) They went on about the new games. I don't think that'll win over tweens and teens but I know my brothers 35+ and gamers always get into the groove. 
6) Pizza still just ok for where you're at. 
7) Soda fountain is PEPSI now, but they offer Twister Orange and a juice. 
8) You can buy tokens at the vending machines and rather than have the coins spill everywhere and fend for yourself in picking them up without being stepped on - they finally offer cups to cradle the coins. Heather C's review sounds like Juarez Mexico. 
9) Safety is still present and I do worry about molesters/abductors/weirdos and just general creepy dudes and dudettes. So to Dave J. maybe they slacked when the other Yelpers were coming through but from 2003-2007 I had no issue. Those stamped barcodes had better match or the teenager working the door makes you stand to the side. 
*Regardless the other reviews are funny. =) 
10) Found quality is about the same as you'd get from frozen wings and cheesesticks from your freezer section but Ledo's/Lido's pizza in Maryland on the U of MD campus tastes like the old school CEC - so real issue there. 
11) The fries are baked. YAYYY! and they're are super skinny. 
12) We tip for birthday parties. The ticket blaster is what brought us back at this age. THE KID WAS TOLD NOT TO REACH DOWN AND GET THE 1,000PT TICKET AND I DON'T LIKE THAT AS OTHER KIDS WERE ALLOWED TO REACH AND GET IT. For the money I paid; all rules/policies should be equally enforced not arbitrarily applied. I'd dock another star for this but oh well, not today. 

13) Book a Friday or Sunday party - get another 100 tookens. Deposit requirement for a party has gone up to $30 down no refunds. Changes allowed on the reservation, though."}
{"text":"We had my daughter's birthday party here. The price was $200 for 4 pizzas and tokens for the kids. We had booked a 10AM time which is the time they open. They opened about 2 minutes late and then when we get in they didn't have our table setup. 2 other parties where there who had theirs. Apparently the girl who was supposed to host our party called in but then no one took over for her to set us up. So we got setup about 15 minutes past 10:00. 

Then they come out and tell us the oven is not working so we may not get pizza! Ok crap happens and I get it but they offered no solution. No real manger was in so no one can tell me any alternative or if I would get a discount. By the time the manger got in and came to see me one of the other parties gave up and left. I was about to cancel the pizza because of how late it already was (11:25) and are party ended in just over 30 mins. 

They ended up comping 50% of my bill and giving us some free tokens and a pass to come back for dinner and drinks plus more tokens another night. I feel they made up for it but it should have been handled sooner and better. The problem with the oven was the gas was messed up and the gas company had to come out and fix it. I don't blame them for the problem, but I do blame them for the lack of a resolution sooner. The staff was courteous and did the best they could given the circumstances but I probably would not do another birthday party there."}
{"text":"always a great experience, kids are always happy. fun time good place for parties"}
{"text":"This place is an absolute JOKE! Aside from the service being terribly slow and the place not being the most cleanest, they also need to train their employees on how to properly stamp the hands of kids and their families. My family was treated with the least amount of respect as we were leaving one of the kids birthday parties (we have TONS of parties here but not anymore after this experience) We were stopped at the exist where at least 4 of the 6 kids hands weren't reading (4 of which are foster kids) A comment by the guy at the door that really made me upset was \"Are you guys all together?\" Yes, we are!! Why wouldn't we be? Because we are a mixed race family? The guy had to call over another employee instead of grabbing the host who did our birthday party to verify we are in fact ALL TOGETHER. So the girl pulled three of the kids over (3 foster kids and my sisters daughter) She interrogated the foster kids and sisters daughter asking \"What's your mommies name?\" \"Can you point to who you came here with?\" etc. This really frustrated the kids to the point they were crying after and my sister was utterly embarrassed. This is not a way you treat families especially ones that are fostering multi-racial children, they are already living a hard life in foster care and to be ridiculed in public when they simply wanted to have a fun time, is out of this world! You guys really need to train your people AND verify the stamps on hands with a light before letting kids and their families into the establishment. I'm sure this hand stamp thing will be a continued issue in this establishment. I will be going forward with filing a complaint with the corporate office and never spending a dime here again."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible horrible service here ! I'm so very disappointed, walked in no one was able to assist us at the register for 10 minutes, so the manager or whatever he was Ramiro finally comes to take our order . No \"hi\" Or \" sorry about the wait\" so whatever then the salad bar looked old like it was sitting all day! Towards the end of the night my kids took up the tickets to get a prize! This young boy was either new or just plain out special, everything my son wanted he said they were out of. So I wanted to save my tickets and he didn't know how to do that either never again will we return to this location."}
{"text":"Kids world! Messy yes, but what are to expect with kids running around? Unsanitary? Not at all. I saw employees running around keeping up. Best service I've had at any chuck e cheese! Nicholas was the best! Very attentive and patient! 
Thank you. I will most certainly return."}
{"text":"Come on, the place isn't that bad. Some of these reviewers have lived some very sheltered lives. You gotta go in with the understanding of the kind of chaos that comes with a hundred plus kids running around in a small space.

When I went, the young staff pretty cheerful and helpful. For example, the guy who took our food and token order applied coupons for us without asking. There just isn't a ton of them to go around. I saw someone guarding the exit continuously, checking every single grown up and kid for matching marks.

The pizza was better than expected. It's not the worst pizza I've had around here. I think you have to get the thin and crispy crust. Salad bar items were fresh.

About 6 games didn't give us our tickets, and a couple took our credits and didn't let us play. If you go there with an aim to collect as many tickets as you can to go for the prize, you're going to get mad. But if you just go to have fun, keep in mind each game play for us was about 20 cents.

Only weirdness there was the guy who decided to bring in both his toddler and his gun."}
{"text":"Poor experience at this location tonight. Our group of 4 waited an hour for our large pepperoni pizza. We landed the only available booth near the emergency exit and sat there to wait for our pizza after playing some games to kill time. We checked on the pizza after approx 25 minutes. We were told by the staff member at the front it would be done in 5 minutes. After waiting another half hour, we checked on it again and told Christina, the cashier, that it had now been an hour since we ordered one pizza. She went to the back and came back with a large pepperoni pizza. No apology, no smile, nothing. What she did say, however, \"was your ticket number displayed on your table?\" We said yes, we are sitting in the corner. She responded, \"oh, you're hiding.\" We were not amused. That booth was the only
available booth when we arrived at 530pm. In addition, the tables in our section sat dirty and cluttered almost the entire time we were there, 1 skee ball machine wasnt loading balls, 1 ticket exchange machine wasnt working and the salad bar needed restocking of items each time we went up or passed by (croutons, ranch, sunflower seeds, bits of food mixed in the wrong sections, etc.). We didnt see many people getting pizzas, so we dont know what the holdup was, but an apology for the wait would have been appreciated."}
{"text":"I like that this location has upgraded its games but I've seem to realize that every time I've come to this location there's always some sort of issues.  My son loves coming here.  I mean I came one time with my family and we've ordered food and we got up to play games and I turned to go back to sit down and our food was gone.  Also I have ordered fries they literally only had like 7 pieces in the basket for $3.29 that's ridiculous.  There just seems to be not enough employees working.  Also when you want to order a beer you have to wait for a manager since most of the employees working here are under age they take a very long time to get to the cash register to take you order.  I don't think I'll be coming back to this location anymore"}
{"text":"Outdated and not that good. 20 years ago it was barely cool. The kids were not impressed. Half the games are broken or malfunctioning.  The salad was sort of wilted. The pizza was not flavorful and hard like it was overcooked.  I think this is just an outdated concept. Not incredibly clean also."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service! I've asked for the manager twice and he had not come to take care of his cuatomers. The games don't work bit will take ir kids tickets. Employees look lost when u ask them to come fix it. I will never bring my son to this location again. I have never experience this at any other location. Tables are disgusting and not clean to the point that the customers have to ask the employees to come and clean them. The floor in front of the soda machine is sticky and nasty that I keep sticking to the floor. The manager finally came out and actually had an attitude instead of apolgizing and handling the situation better."}
{"text":"We came with a coupon for my son's birthday from their club and they wouldn't honor it. We showed them the coupon on our smart phone and even the email that contained it. They said it had to be printed out even though it didn't say that anywhere. This is a perfect example of poor customer service. The cashier didn't seem to care."}
{"text":"Horrible service the food took over an hour to come out and when it did the order was Wrong. When the new order came out it was cold. I would never come back and advise people to stay away from this place."}
{"text":"My kid loved it but when her tickets got stuck in the counter machine it took about 25 minutes for someone to help us. Also, on the way out the lady read my number as 117 and my babies as 114 (which it wasn't it was just smeared). Luckily I was with another part of our group who had 114 but in any other case, what would have happened if the baby who came in my arms had a different number than me? A little kid also tried to bite me, which isn't a reflection on the business but yikes!!"}
{"text":"We went yesterday because my daughter loves Chuck E. Cheeses (I'll be honest, I'm not a fan). Overall, we had fun. My daughter enjoyed it very much and all the games were functional (at least the ones my daughter wanted to play). Noticed that their pizza menu was modified and now they offer options for \"adults\" like chicken BBQ pizza. We'll be back, so far is the best Chuck E. Cheeses we have been in Vegas (the other ones we've been to were crazy and filthy)."}
{"text":"Love the thin crust pizza! I refuse to buy tokens EVER it's a ripoff... As long as you know this your good to go 
It's best to get tokens with the meal package if it's a must. 
Ok customer service. Chuck should stay out with the kids longer."}
{"text":"My girlfriend's 6 year old daughter loves this place. As far as the food goes, I wouldn't recommend it. Usually when I take her, I skip the food and we play the games.  Good news is they are super cheap. 5 Bucks will last a while in there. The downside to that is that the games are very outdated. Once she gets a little older I think she will realize how old the games are. But then again, how many games can you play for a quarter in this day and age? Overall, the service isn't bad and the place does a good job to keep kids entertained."}
{"text":"Pizza was awesome as usual. Hubby and I took our two year old here it was slow which is fine but a handful of machines ate our tokens!!! There were only a few people working and they were constantly busy. The bald manager was sort of a jerk..."}
{"text":"Every time I host my party's here for my sons birthday it's with Andrea I've done my sons last two birthdays with her she was an awesome host & recently a friend who attended my sons birthday wanted Andrea to host the party so she called & requested for her & they told us she is no longer there so kinda disappointed because I have had some disagreements with some of the staff who are rude & seem like they don't care about there job"}
{"text":"This was the worst party I've ever seen here.  Maria greeted us when we came in for my nephew's party; Maria was very sweet, polite and accommodating and then it went down hill from there because Alana was our party host.

I'm sorry but this girl should not be a party host...she was short, rude and pushy with the kids and even though we were the only party there with no other party coming in before we were done she rushed the kids through everything.  The kids were still eating pizza and she started bringing out ice cream and before they could even start on the ice cream she brought out the cake with ONE (1) candle on the cake for a 9 year old.  

My Neice had to step outside to take an emergency call and a friend of hers told Alana that we can't do the cake until his mom comes back....nope, she had the rat out there singing happy birthday and lite the candle all with his mom outside.  She got a lot of crap from my Neice's friends for not waiting or having any respect for the kids my Neice.

Now if this was just my opinion ok but it's not...all the adults were pissed and my Neice and her friend both let Maria know how upset they were.  The kids being so young did not realize the disrespect or how pushy and unpleasant Alana was making this party.

As long as Alana is a party host I cannot recommend this place.  You don't talk down to kids and treat them like that.  She cut my Neice short of a gift bag and was very very stingy with everything.  We didn't need or want anything for free, some respect and being thankful someone is actually willing to spend some money in this establishment is something they should be thankful for.  

The food was good and the place was clean but we were also the first party of the day.  Other then that I will not recommend this place.  There are a lot of other places to have a kids party and you will be treated like it is your special day, not like here, hurry up and get out...that's how Alana made us feel."}
{"text":"Never go to this  place ever again..The new GM is an asshole and even his employees don't like him. I put my $5 in the machine and sister give me coins when told him he said that there's no money there. I told him to go look at there camera he said he didn't see any. But he will give me credit and he told me I'm not allowed to put mobeoin the machine anymore and if I want it go to the cashier. He was an asshole and sarcastic hes an idiot mongoloid piece of shit.!!!!"}
{"text":"Had a really nice time (we usually do)! My children love chuckes! It's a little pricey but we had a coupon to make it a little better!! It's usually pretty crowded however it was nice and not so bad.  the only thing I would say is I wish chucky would have stayed out longer so I could but picture with the kids."}
{"text":"We just threw a child's birthday party at Chuck E Cheese and it ran very smoothly.  For $24/kid, each kid got $20 worth of tokens, pizza, ice cream, and a drink with collectible cup.  
The party host did a great job keeping the party going and communicating with me about what was happening.  The host took care of ordering all the food, brought out the tokens, and cut the cake and our host Lindsay was on the ball the whole time and made the event very easy to manage.  For a kids restaurant, the pizza, wings and sandwiches are pretty good.  I really recommend this for a quick and easy party."}
{"text":"We went here today and did a walk in party for my son on his birthday. Which means, we took our own cake and stuff and just sat at tables that weren't in the party area. We used coupons and were able to get 4 pizzas, 12 drinks, and 200 points for $110. We had 8 kids so that came to 25 points on each play pass. They use the play pass cards now and most games only took 1 point. There were a few that took 2 points. Everyone was super nice and helpful. All the staff was very friendly. It was clean and there was someone going around cleaning the entire time we were there. There may have been 1 or 2 games total that weren't working. The pizza was yummy and the drink selection was surprisingly huge. We have been to this location a few times and have always loved it. The Lake Mead location is dirty and none of the games worked. The only issue we had today was the ticket machines. There were like 2 working in the whole place and it took forever to exchange them for the printout to take and redeem at the prize counter. The prizes are still ridiculously overpriced. It's pretty much junk for hundreds of tickets. But, this is the same at all game/ticket places. All in all, we like this place. All the kids had fun so we will be back."}
{"text":"Our party host Holly was incredible! The pizza was surprisingly good! All in all my daughter had a great 4th birthday! Holly is amazing and needs a promotion!"}
{"text":"For the amount of money we as parents spend to come here, the customer service is terrible!!

There is a male manager that works here don't know his name but he is very nice and on days he is working things run smoothly!

The female manager that works here is a whole different story! Very very rude and argumentative and definently can't handle holding down chuckee cheese on a Saturday afternoon. She should not have a management position.

This location is constantly understaffed so be prepared to wait in lines for everything .

My daughter comes here and has a good time , and the best thing about this place is the salad bar but I'm tired of coming and spending 50-$100 and getting shitty service . It's not worth it."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst place for a \"kid to be a kid.\" Half the machines didn't work. I mean literally every other machine was out of order. The ticket-munching machines also either stopped counting tickets and jipped you of entire strings of tickets or said \"print\" but never released a ticket receipt. The pizza was fine; same nostalgic, garbage pizza they've had since I was little. The ticket payouts per $.25 play of a game is about $.02 worth. The prizes? Let's just say one of the higher-ticket in-case items was a plastic ant. Absolutely will never return. So focused on turning a profit that all the games have been replaced with garbage low-payouts for prizes of equal garbage value. Screw you Chuck."}
{"text":"This was the worse experience I ever had. I have done parties for my kids in the past in another state and never had a problem and I don't usually complain. However, it was my daughters 5th birthday, nothing was ready, I was told they ran out of pitcher to serve drinks in but noticed another party who came after had pitchers. I had to wait to be seated to our table. I was expecting more from this location. I would NEVER do a party there again. Mind you, this is my first time in my entire LIFE I have complained about customer service. However, my host was wonderful, I don't think it was her fault."}
{"text":"I brought my almost 2 year old thinking he might be a little on the young side, but they had a cute little toddler zone with a little slide, rides and some games that were lower down.  The musical show with the big electronic characters was a hit too.  My son loved it!  We'll definitely be back.  

Most of the facility was nice & clean, but the washrooms were pretty gross.  

Don't expect much in prizes, they're pretty dinky, but didn't make a difference to my little guy."}
{"text":"Nice and clean. I had the first birthday deal for my daughter' birthday. They are very nice and also added extra gifts for her with her deal! She had fun and wanted to play more. The hostess was very nice and had good cheerful attitude. All in all not a bad place to have a party. Lots of tickets! Some cards that they can go use in the arcades and rides!"}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday party.  I've been here in the past, and i remember that half the games were not working - out of order.

This time, there was only 1 game out of order, that i could see.  Plenty of staff around working - keeping busy.  Kids seem to enjoy the games and atmosphere.  Tables were clean. I didn't order anything, but there was a All you can eat salad bar for $7.99, it looked ok, but not good enough for me to buy.. 

Party area in the back is big enough for large groups, and they have music and large screen tvs to entertain the kids.

So.. really not that many complaints.. but there's no wow factor anymore. Maybe the games there are getting dated.  I remember going to woody woodchucks, and wanting to go back, i think it was that huge play structure they had.  This one here at Chucks is not big at all.  

3.5 stars for \"1st time at Chuck E Cheese\"
2 stars for \" visiting here for the 3rd 4th time\"

Staff seemed ok, i didn't deal with staff, or stay for the birthday party, it was a drop off.  So i can't rate the staff and service."}
{"text":"The WORST lunch buffet ever! No variety. 4 pizzas and salad with nothing to put on your salad (No tomatoes or ANYTHING except croutons to put on it.  What a joke compared to Cicis's buffet or Peter Piper pizza. One adult, One child and one drink almost $15. Chuck E Cheese has become a fossil of what it used to be. I'm sad I spent $15. The food quality is poor, no variety AT ALL. Go to one of the above places and save your time and money. Was looking forward to taking my daughter here because it's close to home but I'll drive out of my way next time. 

No new plates when you go back to get more. I'm sure that's a health violation. 

Merry go round you pay for and it goes around once?!?!

NEVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"So we had my daughter 6th Birthday party. I have never had a party at Chuck E. Cheese so I didn't know what to expect. I was able to come early to decorate( they were totally cool with it even though the package came with decorations) the host was great very hands on!!! 

The pizza was good, samplers platers better then I was expecting. Loving the new card system. Over all my guest had an amazing time and the birthday girl loved it. I would recommend having your child's birthday party here.

The best part is now clean up and my host did all the work. I was able to enjoy my guest and had a ton of fun with my daughter"}
{"text":"I did a walk in party for my daughter. I came in early of course so I can get a table. Every table was either reserved, occupied, or guessing if it's occupied or not because the tables either had trash on top of it or food left over. Some of you would probably think okay, it's obvious that those two reasons I gave means it's no longer occupied... You'd be surprised! I'm not writing this review to complain. I'm just letting others know for their information if they ever decide to do a walk in party or a walk in, in general. This is what will happen. It is very crowded. I came in on a Saturday @ 5pm. Cashier's were great. I didn't wait for more than five minutes in line to get my order each time. Overall, there wasn't much of a problem. Everyone had a good time!!!"}
{"text":"Worst place ever, EVERYTHING was out of order. They took forever to give me my food & the place wasn't even packed. I had literally just paid for a salad & the cashier didn't give me my salad plate. I assumed they might be next to the salad bar. I asked the same cashier again \"where are the plates?\" & goes \"you have to pay for it\" LOL I just waived my receipt @ her & said \"I just got done paying for it you didn't give me my plate\"  smh."}
{"text":"My son loves this place but not me. My son is only 4 and I can't really sit down without some kid trying to take his coins. So as he gets older and able to hold his own ill be more comfortable with this place. But it's def inexpensive though so that's a good thing."}
{"text":"Only give it 2 stars because Sweet young lady Nayla tried to make this experience better for my niece and nephew.. we ordered family pizza and they made it wrong, and didn't get my fries. Went to get ketchup and manager Gilbert charged me for ketchup..."}
{"text":"I want to say Thank you, to all my fellow yelpers and sharing their reviews. I wish I would've listen."}
{"text":"Brought my little guy here the other day to see how he reacted to such a place since he is just now 2yrs old. He just loved this place.
But first ..when you walk in they stamp you and your kiddos with a black light sensitive stamp and the numbers have to match to the child you are trying to leave with in the end. I found this to be a great feature since you can never trust anyone these days.
I was also glad to see there was no longer a germ laden ball pit. There was a huge climber thingy that was a bit to advanced for my little guy. But the games were all good for him. He loved the race car games the most.
As for food..they have a little salad bar we decided to try for like 6 bucks. Not a huge variety of things but they had the basics and it was all freshly stocked by the kids that worked there.
Of course I will be back..I have a toddler."}
{"text":"Only 1 Chuck E Cheese's in Calgary = Mayhem on a Saturday!

Was here for a 2 year old's bday party on a Saturday.... talk about CRAZY and LOUD, bells and alarms every which way and felt like there were millions of kids screaming and running everywhere haha... It was sooo busy that there were line ups for rides and some games (for the little ones of course - haha).

If you're there for a bday party, don't line up... head on in to the gate on the left side and let them know, they'll let you bypass the line (Thank goodness!)

Food:  pizza, fries, an app platter (with chicken wings, celery, fried cheese, etc) and a salad bar. 

Phew... was exhausted after 3 hrs! :) haha."}
{"text":"I just turned 59, it was my birthday when I went. I took my wife with me. She didn't seem happy to be there and complained about how it smelled like pee. I know she was just containing her excitement and she was probably just smelling her upper lip. Anyways, I was forcing her to play a game with me and the machine started to overheat and caught fire. She screamed and left me there while I started to catch fire too. Long story short, my wife left me and I was on fire and died while celebrating my birthday. The pizza was good tho, so two stars it is."}
{"text":"I've been to several other Chucky Cheese's elsewhere and they were from ok, to decent to a great place.....This one is the biggest dive. I've been here a few times as I thought the first time might have been a out of the ordinary but I was wrong. The place was crowded, had to always wait for a machine, the food was blah and my kids didn't even touch it, there were several people and also kids being very loud and pushy and then twice heated arguments broke out. The machines were not very clean with the bathrooms not much better. I would use gross as the best way to describe it. One star is one too many."}
{"text":"Came here for my sons 6th birthday it was great! Our server Alana was wonderful. Was super cheerful and gave amazing customer service. We had a big party and they accommodated us with no problems! 


My son is a happy camper. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I used to come to this Chuck e cheese pretty regularly with my son. Today will be my last time I step foot in a chuck e cheese. We arrive I order a pizza, tokens a soda for my son and I order a beer. About 40 minutes later while my son is off playing I go up to get a second beer , I'm told their new policy is 1 beer per hour. Ok fine I'll wait till I get home. But as I'm sitting here I see a guy go up to the counter by himself and order 2 beers and two wines. They only check his ID. I go to the Mgr and say how is that not against policy. She proceeds to tell me that he had 4 IDs in his hand and she checked them. I told her that is illegal and she tells me it's our policy. This not only makes no sense at all but is illegal. They want to make sure adults can only have one beer per hour because it is a \" kid  environment \" as I was told but they don't seem to care that if you grab 4 drinks at a time and walk away from the counter and hand them to anyone you choose maybe even someone underage. We won't be coming to this business anymore"}
{"text":"This place used to be one of our favorite location, but now I would not recommend this place. Today 2/23/17 I am here for my sons school fundraiser and it is VERY DISAPPOINTING, most of their games were down or not working and there were no labels/signs saying they were out of order.  As for the food I always order the family platter since we get tired of eating pizza, but now they keep changing the food selections which is more disappointing.  Will never come here again until they make some updates. Their games needs to be updated, and customer service needs improvement."}
{"text":"Took my son here to play for a few hours. This place is all the same as other Chuck E Cheese's. Now they have a $5.99 pizza lunch buffet for adults and children. The pizza was average for a children's play place. One thing was the pizza was very greasy on all the pizzas. They had a variety of around 8-10 different types of pizza including a dessert pizza. This place does the pizza almost the same as Cici's Pizza buffet. They charge for drinks separately. They didn't have enough staff on hand so we had to wait about 5-10 minutes for cashier. There were a total of maybe 3 employees. There was one at the entrance and maybe 2 other employees running around the whole place. The whole place was not that busy. For a few hours of fun and games, eating some pizza with drinks for two people normally would cost about $40."}
{"text":"Fun place for the kids to play games. The food is not worth the price but I enjoy watching the kids have fun playing the games. It's a good idea to check out the website to get a coupon."}
{"text":"This place is very nice and very clean. The staff is friendly. I see the staff monitors the kids as well as the parents. They still offer one beer per parent. Bathroom was ok they could monitor it a little better."}
{"text":"It's Chuckie E Cheese where a kid can be a kid and an adult can act like an unresponsible parent and ignore their children as they run around the place covered in pizza grease. 

Good deals at the front allow you the option to select and play enough games to stay occupied."}
{"text":"Great place to have a kid's birthday party. Lots of tables and chairs. Good food-- pizza and a salad bar. Service was good, but some of the machines (at least 4-5) were out of order.. :-(."}
{"text":"Great location! Clean and lots of current WORKING games. We had the pleasure of dealing with EM and she had great customer service . We will be back!"}
{"text":"Was never a big Chuck E Cheese fan but these guys changed my mind. This location is the only Chuck E Cheese I've been to where the staff is constantly wiping down and disinfecting the games. The bathrooms was clean and well supplied. The staff was attentive, super friendly, energetic, interacted well with everybody and they were constantly bussing the tables. All the games worked just a few didn't give out tickets when it was suppose to but it didn't matter because every gAme was working. The kids had a blast, I had a blast everything that Chuck E Cheese is suppose to be happened today. Oh and the biggest plus when I first walked in I was NOT greeted by the overwhelming smell of socks like all the other ones I been to."}
{"text":"Clean, brightly lit, lots of fun games for the kids. They love it. We go for the kids to play and have fun; not for great food or drinks! At least they have a salad bar!"}
{"text":"I had a great time here, it was my daughters birthday and everyone was very helpful and nice. Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"This review is only based on my son's birthday party at Chuck E Cheese's. They do a great job of throwing an all inclusive party including pizza, tokens, cake option, party assistant and birthday boy extras to make him feel special. Party highlights are scheduled out during the two hour block and they keep everyone on time with the birthday show. The pizza and cake were surprisingly good, a big plus!
On the downside, the manager was a jerk but that only bothered me and it was prior to any guests arriving - worthy of note but not a big deal. Today was about my son and he had a great time!"}
{"text":"Now this was an experience, and I know now why I don't come here on purpose (came for my niece's son b-day party)...    The pizza was absolutely horrible, no flavor, no cheese, and all crust.  I guess that what you get when you hire kids to feed people...    I am amazed a place like this can stay in business.   

I did give  them 3 stars cause I love that the kids enjoy torturing their parents into spending 20 - 40 bucks on tokens to win tickets to be traded in for some thing worth less then 5 bucks. That was fun to watch.   

Free enterprise at its best."}
{"text":"Well it just opened at 10:00 am and you would think it was cleaned. Absolutely not. Bathrooms disgusting, urine smell so bad almost vomited.  Killed 2 Roaches by kids area.  Pizza like cardboard and not sure what lurks under salad bar area. Was afraid to order. What are the odd's any game or ride as been cleaned in the past year? Doubt it."}
{"text":"Seems clean but this must be a very small location because most of the ones in California are really big! Also staff was nice."}
{"text":"My sister ordered a cheese pizza. Took an hour before I decided to go ahead and see what was taking so long. Come to find out they said they stamped it saying it was sent already out. Obviously it was not sent out if I still had the number with me. Anyways asked for a refund, the lady was just going to give me a refund and nothing else until one manager that was assisting told her to do a free cheese pizza for us. So the pizza was late but they gave us a free pizza in the end which was okay just wasn't happy it was that late. I was going to give this rating a 3 star but decided to give this rating a 4 star because my sister was holding my baby while walking out. They didn't let her walk out because their numbers were not matching. That's one thing I like about chuckee, they make sure the kids are safe!!!! That's why I gave chuckee a 4!!!!"}
{"text":"Hello friends, 

I had my Sun's (no typo) 2nd birthday party here.  Our host (sorry young lady,  but I forgot her name)  was exceptional.  She really did a great job accommodating everyone on our party.  Some with food allergies etc.

I dont know about others but this location offers Beer.

I remember years ago Chuckie Cheese had a group of friends. Well, they must have fell out over some cheese or something because they were M.I.A. 

The ChuckieCheese here.  He looked like he is 5 mins away frokm asking for spare change.  (See photo) 

Go enjoy,

{"text":"The BF and I came for our friends kids birthday party. Yes, we don't have kids ourselves, but come in the name of solidarity and making all the kids jealous of our game playing skills and fat ticket stacks or so we thought. There are few places to do kids birthday parties and I'm sure kids were having a great time, but I laughed at some of the glazed looks on some parents eyes.

They tried to make it better by offering lite beer and generic wine, but I guess some Summahood parents went buck wild as there is a one per hour limit on alcohol per person. I don't think you can even get a buzz from that even if you used that watered down crap as a alcohol enema. I don't know what changed with pizza, but it was much better even in the past  years when I've been to birthdays for my nephews here and certainly it was way better when I was a child. Now it taste much more frozen, premade crust. Did not try anything else like wings on the menu and there is a small salad bar which is maybe your best bet honestly. 

Now the BF and I walked around in hopes to find some games to play. Together because you can't leave a mustached tall white man alone without paranoid parents pulling their kids away I make the boyfriend slightly less molest-y. Fuck your ugly little ginger kid, sir. 

There were a lot of games that were like throw your coin in and leave it up to chance type games. Basically, slot machines for babies and equally as rage inducing and disappointing, but compels you to put more coins in. One even was a complete racket. I put a coin in, got it where it should to score some tickets then it told me I got a  \"bonus\" ticket frenzy type thing, but only if I throw another coin in. Stick to playing interactive games like the basketball, football toss and skeeball. Don't go on the spinning game/ride thing. It smells like pee pee. The best game we found was a Deal or No Deal thing as it had long play value and the BF somehow picks the suitcase with the max amount of tickets so it's one of the few that pays out.  I know I didn't get less shitty on games as I got older, so they must have become tighter on tickets as I had a tiny pile. I have in a storage box a few dolls I won at Chuck E Cheese circa the 90's so the prizes definitely aren't as great either as everything was looking much more low quality. The playground is one area to climb up and go into 2 tubes to 2 hidey holes and a slide - that's it. I guess it can't be TOO fun because they need you to play some games. 

If you do go, look online for coupons. There's almost always a $20 for 100 tokens and some food coupons (though I advise to get pizza instead across the street before/after instead) . 

The plus for me is the random video montages, music videos and slightly creepy sensual song choices of the animatronic singing Chuck E. I was singing the parody of the Michael Jackson song they did \"I wanna Barbeque\" all night from this music video of some purple Grimace/ Barney/Chef lovechild thing in a glittery ass suit. Probably highlight of entertainment is musical adults discussing merits of these little jingles. And what is up with the Zach Galifianakis look alike with a wolf painted face hanging out on a beach during sunset video clip?

Maybe showed up a bit too sober, but definitely learned if there is a next time."}
{"text":"It's 5:20pm they are out of salad, ranch dressing and michelob ultra the tomatoes look like they are a month old.  We are told we will have to wait 20 minutes for the beer to be fixed.  The salad \"oh we will fill it in a minute.
The best thing was Chuckie which was the bus boy but he was supper fun with the kids.
Crushed red pepper was almost out so the obviously don't care!
It's not cheap by any means and the pizza taste like a frozen pizza but make an effort the kids love coming here so the parents continue."}
{"text":"0 stars for line management! Stood in line for a long time...we saw cashiers do other tasks and not concentrating on the customer in front of them...so I decided to time our transaction to see how long it would take. It was 10 1/2 minutes! Before our turn, we saw 3 cashiers, then 2 then to just 1 cashier to deal with their line at 7:30 pm on a Saturday night! We ordered the #2 and asked to substitute 2 of the 4 soft drinks for a milk and an apple juice...it says at the beginning of the menu that you can substitute milk or juice for free. Although we told the cashier it says it on the menu, she still charged us, and after reminding her, she just kept telling us how much milk and apple juice was. So after 3 min., she called for a manager...but it took 5 min for the manager to come out from the back...and she skipped us to hand something to the employee working at the door, and when she passed through again, our cashier stopped her to remind her that we were waiting for her to fix our transaction, but she said she had to do something in the back first. I've worked in retail and customer service all my life and no one is more important than the customer in front of you! The manager came to tend to us 10 min into our transaction...and asked if we wanted a beer??

Also...warm soda! No ice at both fountain drink stations.

5 stars for the pizza arriving when we sat down...after our 2 kids whining for 10.5 min in line, we were grateful. 

5 stars also for the gentleman fixing the games. 

5 stars for the same manager who later allowed us to get toys without having to pay the difference because we didn't have enough tickets. 

Good value: pizza is good, the games lasted our 2 toddlers for more than 2 hours."}
{"text":"Took kids here for doing a great job in school, weekends are the busiest but the staff were attentive and food order was quick than other times we have been there. Some machine had problems and ticket collecter kept getting jammed to call attendant but they were on it once a complaint was made. A great choice on a budget for kids to have fun."}
{"text":"Need more action games for kids like my 4 year old boy. Need to get him more tired. The games need to be more genorous on the amount of tickets they spit out. Kids man! Don't be stingy, they're still developing their skills, even though my son was pretty good at shooting 5he the ducks in the water. His favorite it seems, but won't get him tired like the dog pounder right next to it."}
{"text":"This Chuck E Cheese is like the majority of the Chuck E Cheese's we've been to. However with one clear exception, it has been cards instead of the tokens that you have to lug around. The staff is friendly and moderately helpful as is the case at most of these locations. All in all, and average experience."}
{"text":"Token machine stops working after  i put my money in!! $20.00 lost!!! Everthing is broke and dirty at 11:30.. everyone working is rude and mad at me because everything us broke???? Just give my 5 year old his tokens??? & fix all your broken stuff and clean this place so it dosnt smell so bad that there is no way i want to eat here. 

.bad management...."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is garbage. The food, the staff, everything. We seriously had to ask them for plates for our food. Plates! Give me a break. My son liked it alright, but said he'd rather go to Makutu's Island. Good - I would too, and that's where you'll find us in the future."}
{"text":"Was here last weekend for a birthday party with my daughter. I counted at least 8 games out of service! Every time I would take my daughter over to game that looked like she would be able to play, it said out of service. Don't know what if the games are just waiting on parts or management is just being lazy??"}
{"text":"This Chuck E. Cheese blew my mind not only was the service great but me and my family received so much culture from our visit. The short Mexican manager was very helpful in fixing the ticket machine. The pizza here really tingles your tastebuds. Overall my visit was great."}
{"text":"Took my granddaughter here for lunch. Love that they check you in and out through the door. I love the security. We waited 35 minutes for our pizza which was kind of ridiculous. When the pizza came it was pretty much burnt on top. The cheese was brown! I'm only giving it three stars because my granddaughter did have fun even though she kept coming back to the table and asking if the pizza was ready yet. At least the very hungry four year old was entertained."}
{"text":"If you have kids 8 and under this is the ideal place as the environment is controlled, all of the games take just one token. The interaction going on the Chuck E. Cheese's main stage is great!! It keeps the kids entertained with music, dance and videos!!! 

To my surprise over the years the pizza has remained better than expected and the Chuck E. Cheese show on the main stage is such a great way to get the kids and families with Birthday engaged!! I like how they have classic videos that the kids like and animation to help reel in the kids attention.

Party prizes and about the same like many of the competitors so your not gaining or missing out on anything. I do like how you have some chances (when part of the birthday parties) to win some big number tickets worth 100, 200, and 1000's so the kids can get some cool things. 

If your looking to plan an easy low key party this is a good location. And just like all other Chick e cheeses, they do a good job stamping the kids and parents and monitoring the door with designated staff..."}
{"text":"OK place for the kids birthday parties or group treats.  A little loud for just a family outing but as long as you're aware, which you should be at a place like this then no problem.  

My main reason for taking off two stars is the check out process for redeeming tickets from games.  You get your receipt and pick out what want, problem is you redeem at the same place you are picking allowing indecisive, and sometimes inconsiderate, people to stand there for ever deciding what they want while the person behind them may just redeeming 30-40 tickets and know what they want but they are struck waiting on these people.  Simple solution would be to allow people to see the items not at the same place you redeem the tickets so they can jot down what they want and a separate station to redeem them.  That would seem much more efficient and keep tensions at bay between patrons.

Also had to edit this review and take away another star because my 5 year old's jacket and mine were stolen, yes really.  I also understand a scarf from another lady in our party was taken.  Sad this is what we have come to where people steel from kids at a child oriented restaurant.  

Don't think we'll be returning, if we do we'll be sure to lock up any items and not have anything that needs to be set down."}
{"text":"Decided to do my daughter's second bday party here. Everything went well except they forgot to give us the 20 ice cream that I pre-ordered online. I just realized it after the party. On a regular day, I notice the mascot isn't very enthusiastic. You also wait a looong time to claim your prize. Staff just walk around not paying attention to the customers waiting for them. Anyway, I only go here because my daughter loves going this place and she enjoys each time and thats what matters most."}
{"text":"I am going to give this place a solid 3 stars, but if management spends some money and improves the interior (maybe re-paint it with some vibrant colours, it could make a difference. O.k, lets start with the review. I hosted a party for  4 year old with with 12 kids, and 20 adults. There were 3 parties going on at the same time, and we had a reserved section with for the kids and adults.  We were allotted 2 hours in the reserved section and everything went very well. The food we ordered was great (pizza, sandwiches and wings) I loved the fact that we were able to order beer for the adults. Yes this place is a little run down and loud, but there are a lot of games and many of the toddler games only cost 1 token.  The service was very good and our servers were very attentive.  The total cost for the premium party of 12 kids (premium package with tokens, pizza, ice cream and loot bags) and food for the adults including soft drinks and large beers for 12 of the adults came up to about $850.00 which was actually a very fair price. Collectively our group had a great time. Remember this place is geared more for toddlers and kids, don't confuse or compare it with Dave and Busters."}
{"text":"Poor service wait 50 min for a pizza. Ask for a Mgr and they don't have a radio. No apologies at all and they got the order wrong."}
{"text":"Same Chuck E. Cheese as any other. Staff wasn't the friendliest and seemed like they just wanted to go home. The time on Yelp is wrong . It said it closes at 11 and they closed at 10 so we had an hour less that we thought we were going to have. We def wouldn't have bought so much credits. Manager was unaware and said he would let his boss know."}
{"text":"I was told by staff that there aren't anymore napkins, cheese, or crushed peppers.  Our order for our family wings for 4 was an order for 2. Which then took an 35 to remake.  The wings were cold once received. We asked for blue cheese as seen  on the recipe, but we received ranch. The drink area appeared as if It had not been sanitized properly. I asked 5 different staff members for napkins. After asking the 6th person for napkins we received it. The restrooms was untidy and needed a deep sanitation . Upon arrival, the receptionist was upset because I asked her to write down my child's number instead of stamping him. He was sleeping and I didn't want him ,as a 6 month old,  to be disturbed. She didn't want to take the extra step to insure our child's safety.  I am highly dissatisfied with the safety, cleanliness, and the customer service of this facility. Management should make sure all supplies are stocked."}
{"text":"We have seen our share of locations. We have chosen this one because it's clean, quiet, and in a nice neighborhood. At times they run out of stock like their kids theme cups they advertise or their plastic crowns but all in all this is a nice location. 

The best part is when their tech guy is testing the machines. He will win close to 50 tokens on each machine and then just leave the tickets there and walk off. It's like Christmas for the kids. It usually happens during the week and it's perfect for my 2 and 3 year old who doesn't win many tickets anyway. A nice bonus is since we're military they give us extra tokens as well. 

As for their food. It's like any Chuck E Cheese. I've heard if you come on a weekend and they're slammed you're more likely to get a burnt pizza but I've never had that happen since we only come during the week. All in all this location is one of the nicer places we've been to. Great for play dates since it's also centrally located."}
{"text":"Good place for kids to play games. Food is better than I expected it to be.. While there today several birthday parties were going on but they no longer have the animated characters on stage."}
{"text":"Ok, so I got roped into going for my nephew's 5th birthday party. This place is nothing like I remember it when I was younger. First, it seems so much brighter (lots of lights) than I remember and a lot more open. I don't think they have changed the singing animals at all, though. Still plenty of video games and skeeball to enjoy. When I arrived the party had ordered some pizzas. Those weren't too bad. The kids liked them. Now this was the first time I've been here as an adult and I happy to see they do serve beer. Nothing special, Bud, Bud Light & Coors, but when you are surrounded by screaming 5 year olds, you'll drink anything you can! I was slurping those down faster than Richie Incognito could sling a racial slur. All and all, not a bad place to go for a kids birthday party. A good time was had by all."}
{"text":"Visiting from Nebraska, this place was very clean. The machines were all working. Rides and games for little ones were all one token while some of the others were two. Great variety of entertainment. Of course mine and my wife's favorite skee ball. Great selection of drink choices. Salad bar was fresh and very well stocked. Pizza wasn't bad at all. I've had worse from Pizza Hut. We visited for lunch on a Monday. Staff was very pleasant and professional. Prices were very reasonable for the few hours we spent there."}
{"text":"Came on a Tuesday night just to make my child have fun after a long day in the house, we waited so long to see Chuckie, he is supposed to dance and throw tickets out to the kids. When he finally came out, he was late (because there was a countdown) the kids were so disappointed, he came out of the door practically jogging straight to the game section, not even acknowledging the kids waiting at the stage, then he made his rounds and went back inside not even 5 minutes later. Terrible. Never coming back"}
{"text":"/begin rant
I can't believe I'm writing a review of Chuck E Cheese's.  What has my world come to?
/end rant

This place is cool, if you're a kid!  We had my daughter's birthday here this weekend and well, she had a ton of fun.  The birthday party package includes cutting of the cake (that you provide), a happy birthday sing-a-long, free tokens for all the kids in the party, pizza, and salad bar (optional).

I played games with my daughter most of the time and then we realized the pizza had already been served.  So we scrambled back to our table.  The pizza was just okay.  It had fresh ingredients and it was definitely better than trashy Pizza Hut.

The atmosphere was loud and obnoxious, but what do you expect, it's a kids place and there are kids everywhere.  After we finished eating and singing Happy Birthday, our host cleaned everything up and even packaged the leftover pizza and cake for us.  The service was good and the food was okay.  Overall, it was okay.

You've gotta do Chuck E Cheese at least once for each of your kids.

Did you know they serve beer?"}
{"text":"Service is horrible. Half of the machines take your tokens.  Not taking my daughter back here again."}
{"text":"What happened? We use to have a blast coming here, now I can't say the same. Came here to have fun with my two kids and Husband and although my kids still did overall, it still could have been much better. First off, the toddler area was absolutely ridiculous! They had about 6 rides and only two was working. What?! The rest of the games geared for younger kids were not made for that age group. It was difficult to play and stingy with tickets. I mean let's be real, it's for toddlers at least give a decent amount of tickets so the kids feel like they did an amazing job playing the game. 

The rest of the game area was ok. Yes, just ok. Nothing to brag about. We mainly played deal or no deal, skee ball and basketball. LAME!

The manager was the cashier when we entered and was not pleasant. She seemed rushed. She was not focused with the party she was dealing with but focused with whoever she was ordering over her radio. 

The kid at check-in was a joke! She was rude and grabbed our left arm to stamp. When leaving, she checked for our stamp but my youngest sons stamp was smeared. You could not tell what it was. It was a big circle. Um...do you think she event bothered to do further investigation to ensure we were with the child? No! She was rushing us out bc she had a family walking in."}
{"text":"I saw a promotion where Passbook for the IPhone had a deal to get 100 tokens so I thought I would give it a try and it was a fun way to spend a Saturday afternoon with my daughter. We arrived and were greeted by a friendly employee, and again we had a friendly cashier; that's basically where the service ended. 

I was incredibly disappointed to find that a majority of the games were out of order, but what's worse is that they weren't listed as out of order, instead my daughter put in her tokens and nothing happened. The air hockey machine would \"turn on\" but there was no air; after this happened on multiple games, I finally said something to one of the employees who didn't seem to care. At one point I was told \"Someone will be there in a minute\", we waited at least 5 minutes, so I went up and asked again, again to be told \"I'll get someone for you.\" And still no help and when I commented about the lack of anyone coming to assist us, they didn't care. Of the 100 tokens, we were able to use about half of them. I was very disappointed in the lack of customer service I received once my money had been taken.

This experience put a bad taste in my mouth, I'll give Chuck E Cheese a lot of wiggle room, I understand that not every game will work and I have realistic expectations that at least one game will \"eat tokens\" but when it's a majority of the games, that's when it gets into \"rip-off\" territory. When employees don't even offer assistance or an apology; I'm done."}
{"text":"This place is cute, and was clean, but the masses have already left their mark.  What once was a great utopia of fun and frivolity, is now a shell of its former self, littered with games and rides that are \"Out Of Order\" or simply just ingest your hard earned tokens without so much as a \"sad trombone\" sound byte.  You know it ate your token... it knows it ate your token... but nobody's sayin nuthin.

The kids do adore Chuck E though, along with the parade that ensues about the floor, enticing children away from the not-so-watchful eye of their parents with promises of \"free tickets\".  My personal favorite from the Chuck E time, is getting to watch the employees who flag the mouse on either side, perform the Chuck E dance with great enthusiasm.  Then as 2 bags worth of free tickets are tossed in the air, like a Manhattan ticker tape parade, I wince as throngs of children dive head first toward the anticipated landing zone.

All in all, the pizza is decent, and they have a cool ice cream vending machine with prices that arent all gouge'y.  As long as she likes it, I'll keep coming back.

And while I understand my previous review was quite lacking, thanks to all the feedback I received, it was necessary in order to secure the \"First to Review\" slot."}
{"text":"Can't get anybody on the phone without a 10 minute automated Question and Answer service, then you'll wait until their darn good and ready to answer the phone on their end.  After 20 minutes of wasted time, they just lost my daughters birthday reservation for 35 kids.  Don't know how much that would have been but they lost it.

Why I didn't get the free 20 tokens by booking online?  They told me 4 times that I could get 20 free tokens by booking online at ChuckECheese.com, after each and every selection I had to grueling go through...but hey, you can get the free 20 tokens by booking online.  

I didn't book online because I had human questions that deserves a human answer.  And I won't be baited because I can get the free 20 tokens by booking online.  

Now you've read that you can get 20 free tokens by booking online, as many annoying times as I had to hear it. 

If you like high prices and low customer service, which I abhor, then this place is for you, if you've consigned yourself to a poor customer service modern mindset that you apathetically won't find better anywhere else, then this is the place for you.  

Oh, and if you care so little for your money, then send me your money for reading this review.  I'm always willing to take your money for offering very little."}
{"text":"Great Location, unlike other Chuck e Cheese locations that I've visited in other cities. This location is the largest that I've been to and the cleanest. 

What I love about this place is if a game was broken all you have to do is report it and someone would fix it immediately! 

I took a star away because my daughter received 115 tickets yet the at the prize counter calculated 112, she was wearing glasses on so I'm not quite what the problem was.

Other than that mishap, I had a great time and would definitely return here in future, I didn't say how soon! ;)"}
{"text":"This place is ok... as long as you are under age 5. As an adult who has been in here for 3 hours I feel like Ive been labotomized. Games all work, kids have fun, prices are cheap. My only complaint is that they have one cashier working and the line is out the door. So anytime you want to buy tickets or food you gotta wait in that long line.  Sometimes I was stuck in line for 15 mins."}
{"text":"Lord, where do I start..  They changed the tokens and instead force you to buy a card with \"points\" on it.. Now as an adult I can understand how cards work and swiping etc but as a child,  swiping and swiping and basically feeding all your points to a machine that isn't working is a rip off.  I used the card on a couple different machines and nothing worked,  I can only imagine how much money they are making off this new card system. On the way out we had stopped to get the kids their prizes..  One employee was working at the counter,  saw him walk away dig in his but in FULL VIEW and walk back to hand out prizes, I seriously just can't at this point . It took 10 minutes to get our basic dollar store candy and leave.  Upon walking out there were THREE employees sitting buy the front,  when I suggested that the counter people needed help one girl said she was on break..  So I told her to take her a** in the back where employees should have break..  You guys are clearly short staffed and you all decide  to gather in the front and chat it up while mister booty digger has his hands full..  Literally. We will never be back, this place is disgusting and neglected, and a major rip off now they have the cards....  Be AWARE!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"If I were only reviewing the service of the amazing party host Jaxon, this would be 5 stars all the way! However, I must take into consideration the filthy bathrooms and arcade games that aren't working. The staff were all as nice as they could be, but the game area was unbelievable. One game was open with it's mechanical guts all exposed for some kid to trip over and hurt them-self. 

We went recently (our annual visit) to attend a friends' kid's Birthday party. Jaxon was their party host for the 2nd year in a row (they specifically asked for him) and he pulled out all the stops to ensure this little 6 year old had a blast. Jaxon must be Jim Carey's missing love child because he not only looks like him but is totally animated and hilarious like him. He could be a comedian in his own right.

 I just wish the company would take some time to clean this place up since we no longer have the Peter Piper Pizza alternative option."}
{"text":"Out of all of the Chuck E Cheese's in town, this is probably the cleanest I've been to. The staff are readily available to assist and I haven't had to wait 20+ minutes for the kids to redeem the arcade tickets like I have at other locations. The prices aren't bad if you use a coupon from the paper."}
{"text":"Good.
That's the perfect word to describe this CEC. We always go with a coupon...if not prices are way too expensive! On this day we had $24.99 coupon: large 1 top, 4 drinks, and 40 tokens and I was able to use a $2 off coupon for salad bar too. $1.00 up charge since we wanted 1/2 supreme (which is fine). Food took about 10 min or so....in the time we were there CEC came out twice to do his dance and throw out tickets. Place is decent and rides for kiddies are separated well from the bigger kids but unfortunately the big kids always seem to take over the kiddie area. To me if you are over age 5 you belong on the big kid side! I have a 5 yr old and a 18 month old and I think at 5 that's the limit....there was a huge kid on the day we went and he literally knocked over 2 smaller kids because he was rough Housing and just being obnoxious! Anyways....bathrooms were a little messy but I guess that is to be expected in a place with a lot of kids/adults in and out.  Workers seemed ok but not overly friendly as you'd expect. Decent but room for overall improvements!"}
{"text":"I welcome the opportunity to say something good about one of these places.  Usually they are filthy and the pizza sucks.  The place is clean and pizza doesn't taste like cardboard."}
{"text":"Chuck E. Cheese's is all about the kids. With coupons from their online website, we got 3 pizzas, drinks for everyone, 500 tokens, 750 tickets to start, and couple hours of entertainment for 7 kids and 5 adults for $138. It was not busy on Tuesday night, so the kids pretty much had free reign over the place. You know they had a good time when you get a text a few days later from them thanking you for their experience and how much fun they had.

The staff was friendly and helpful throughout our visit and everything was kept clean. I applaud the young woman that helped us when we were redeeming our 3000+ tickets split between 7 kids getting different prizes. That was an excellent exercise in patience.

I also am happy with the safety they provide at the entrance. Each group is provided a different stamp upon entry and a child cannot leave the building unless they are with an adult with the same stamp. Although I was with there with my nieces, they came in separately from us with my parents, when I attempted to walk out with them, I was not permitted to because I did not have the same stamp as them. This safety feature gives you a little peace of mind when a child can escape you for moment and you need to hunt them down."}
{"text":"This is the closest Chuck E Cheese's location to my home. I have had 3 parties there in the last 2 years and plan on having party #4 there as well. I haven't experienced anything that would change my view of this location. They are redoing the toddler area but they moved most of the rides in the main dining area. The salad bar is always full and they move the line fairly fast for ordering food and redeeming tickets. I have visited several CEC's throughout the US and this location is average in size , but it's well kept."}
{"text":"Great for kids and parents to enjoy themselves .  This place really made the bonding experience between my two sons and I so much better.  We all had a blast.  Skeeball was so much fun!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We booked this for a 4 year olds birthday party with a $50 deposit. Decided to go somewhere else. Due to other parents not wanting to take their children here and saying they wouldn't attend. I gave a 6 WEEK, in advance cancellation. They will not refund the deposit which I could possibly be ok with, but will not even let you use it as a gift card for taking your kid there. To me this is just theft of your money. I've never heard of anyplace not letting you use a deposit for something else with that much notice."}
{"text":"This place was actually pretty good when it first opened up, however it quickly has tanked. Ordered $40 in food last night and received pizza that barely had any cheese even on it. It was mostly bread with baked on sauce. Cool that all the games are one token however many will eat your money so it balances out. Prizes are absolute crap as usual, the real hunt is finding an employee to help you. Oh, and the Chuck E Cheese show was restarted not once but TWICE. They let all the kids stand up there excited and the tv is blaring his count down to 1 and nothing happens. No one comes out. I watched them reset it to 6 mins and the same thing happened again. My kids were real over it."}
{"text":"I come here so often I just forget to write reviews.  I am a fan of this location verses the Sunset location.   We had my daughter's 6th birthday here and I was very happy with the party.  The only issue is everyone is pretty much doing their own thing so there is not alot of time together but my daughter was very happy.  They take pride is making it safe for the children where you and your child are stamped when you arrive. When you leave they check to make sure you are leaving with the right kid.  :)  I always check for coupons online which I always seem to find for pizza package deals.  I LOVE the salad bar which is very fresh and the staff are always putting out fresh veggies and making sure it stays clean.  Having ALL the games being only one token is AWESOME.  I might complain about arcades but I always tell my daughter she can wait till we go back to Chuck E and then she skips them.  I like that if you don't want to buy the crappy gifts you would get for the tickets you won you can save up the receipt until you want to come back for that bigger prize.  My daughter has 1000 right now and is wanting to get 10,000.  I think I will have to persuade her to not think of such a high number!  Why I am not giving it 5 stars is that the skee ball game which we love always seems to have problems with not giving the right amount of balls or not working at all.  Plus, I hate parents letting there little ones walk up and place the ball in the hole, you would think someone would say something.  It just doesn't seem like they have enough staff BUT I can say when I have had problems with something not working they have always taken care of us right away - no questions asked.  I will go back again and again!  :)"}
{"text":"By all accounts, I should love places like this.

I mean, I did as a kid.  I enjoy video games, and while I know I'm nowhere near the age of the intended target audience, when you're invited to a birthday party, these should be some amounts of adult level mirth, right?  I'm fairly open-minded as an adult.  I can still play with the kids if wee hands drag me along (and they did).

Man, things have changed since I was a kid.  And yet, not.

Anyone can have a good time with skee-ball or hoop shots, but where are the arcade games?  If it wasn't some novelty item manufactured by Nickelodeon, it pretty much didn't exist.  Again, I get that it's a kid's place.  I'm not expecting House of the Dead, but where are the Pac-Man, Donkey Kong, Centipede fare?  Certainly those games still have some worth in being in one of these places.  They did when I was a kid.

And yet, the \"time warp\" aspect took a weird hold in other ways.  The singing stage animatronic was clearly from the early 1990's at best.  Not one kid seemed interested as Chuck warbled some tune set to a video that was clearly shot no later than 1988.

Not that you could have heard anything.  Kids run batmess crazy in here, while the employees look somewhat shell-shocked.  I was playing a game when an employee just backed into me and stepped on my foot. \"Whoa, excuse me\", I said, trying to put my shoe back on that was removed during said stomping.  The employee just looked at me silently than walked away without saying a word,  At least the four year old that bumped into me earlier could say \"Excuse me\".

Well, at least there's the pizza, right?  I guess I'd be nuts about it if I enjoyed something with the consistency of cardboard mixed with a slight cheese flavor.  I ordered a chicken sausage pizza, which at least has some flavoring to it, but I wasn't going to lose my mind for it.

Again, I am clearly not the audience for this place.  It's not as amazing as I remember from being a kid, and it's not the most adult accommodating place if you're trying to find a little entertainment for yourself alongside the wee folk.

At least I've had the mystery solved of what this place would be like when returning as an adult."}
{"text":"My kids, I and my husband played here and we had fun, no complaints. Friendly staff, clean surroundings, and machine works great. I give 4 stars because there are some minor issues. We will definitely come back here again... players are more professionals than players at stewart & Charleston."}
{"text":"Came with my bestie a the kids had a blast.  Fresh food and nice young staff!   Not to bad...day after Christmas fun!"}
{"text":"Hanging out with the Grandkids.  I don't normally post a negative review, but I needed to post this review. The salad bar is one of worst I have seen.  I needed to let the staff know, their cucumbers were slimy.  The cost of the salad bar is over $8.00 not worth it at all!!"}
{"text":"DO NOT GO IF YOU OR YOUR CHILDREN HAVE FOOD ALLERGIES
We had my son's birthday party on Saturday the 13th, 2016 at the Grand Canyon Drive location in Las Vegas, Nevada.  We primarily picked this location because of the allergy menu listed on the website.  Our son has a severe allergy to peanuts and all tree nuts (which I indicated on our reservation, advised our party host and he also wears a bright orange allergy alert bracelet).  After double checking with our party host, Andrea to please check the chicken nuggets that they were not processed in a facility that may contain peanuts or tree nuts, she verified with the cook and said we were ok.  Then it was time for cake and ice cream, in which we brought our own cake for allergy purposes.  However, the ice cream that is served CLEARLY states on the website that the only allergen is Milk. 
We ordered 20 vanilla ice cream cups because the site stated they were safe.  When our party host brought them out, I just happened to double check the label and it specifically states:
Manufactured in a facility that processes Almonds, Brazil Nuts, Cashews, Coconut, Hazelnuts, Macadamia Nuts, Peanuts, Pecans, Pine Nuts, Pistachios and Walnuts.
 I then took all of the ice creams cups away from the children and told our party host to please take them away immediately.  The manager (Gilbert, suck a jerk) then came to our table and said, \"what's the problem?\" After explaining to him what the issue is he very rudely states, \"well I will take off $1.00, and its not like I can help what our vendors send us.\" 
 Are you freaking kidding me!!! Luckily and thankfully my son did not eat any of the ice cream provided, because it would be my lawyer writing them this letter.  They cater to CHILDREN, and peanut and tree nut allergy is the MOST common allergy in children today, and in most cases it requires emergency hospitalization.  The General Manager, Gilbert that they have representing their brand is not the best fit for that position.  For him to dismiss the situation and hide in the back as to not discuss this issue with me, shows exactly why he is a 40 something year old running a Chuck E. Cheese, from my stand point he is a liability to the corporation.  I will be contacting the Better Business Bureau as well as Social Media sites to make sure all parents know not to trust that location."}
{"text":"I took my daughter here tonight and we had a great time. The games were all functional properly and the facility was clean overall. I ordered some cheese bread from the menu and was satisfied with what I received. I didn't have any issues with this Chuck e. Cheese at all."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible service.  Wish the kiddos didn't like this place. Waited an hour for food for 3 people. And no one cared. At all. Several large parties behind us got their food ahead of us."}
{"text":"Went there Friday for my son's 8th birthday.  This was the first year were it was not the package party.  We went with a coupon and a buddy.  One thing I like about this location over the Sunset location is the places \"seems\" cleaner.  Also, the motion ride is for bigger kids.  The boys had a blast and I relaxed with my soda.  (Which I could not have done at my 4 year old came with us!)  I feel safe there, enough for the boys to run around.  It's a nice one!"}
{"text":"Went there a few Saturdays ago for a party.  I am a Henderson snob and try not to leave my hood unless necessary.  (My fault for having Summerlin friends :-)  Anyway, we usually go to the one on Sunset or Eastern.  I realize this is a \"newer\" one and should be in good condition.  I was a little unimpressed by the fact that there was two games out of order with no signs, one which took my son's token.  IMO-it's just about maintenance and that should not happen, particularly because they had just opened for the day.
Our kids love CEC, but not impressed with this location."}
{"text":"Nice visit,only issue is they don't do the roadshows every hour like they are suppose to and the restrooms were absolutely DISGUSTING. I've been here for 3 hours with my kids and not one time did Chuck e come out. I even asked the workers was Chuck e coming out and was told they would talk to the manager about it and still nothing.  Disappointing for a 5 year old when they hear the tv annoucement say Chuck e is coming and then he never shows."}
{"text":"I took my 6 yr old nephew on a very busy Sunday afternoon. The facility was clean, broken or emptied ticket machines were attended to quickly and there was staff available at all points.  The people at the food counter were very nice and patient."}
{"text":"This place is GROSS. My husband and I took my, at the time, 7 year old step son to this Chuck E Cheese...never agian. Our 2 younger kids will NEVER be allowed to enter this \"establishment\".
1. The pizza is God awful...just don't. 
2. The games are outdated but at least they're cheap.
3. There are swarms of rude, poorly-behaved, unattended ragamuffins everywhere. They will steal your children's tokens and tickets if they think you're not looking. I'm sure they'd do the same to you purse. There were some well behaved kids there too, unfortunately the mini-felons are the ones you notice.  :(
4. Some of the parents are equally as rude and immensely trashy. Guess the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. 
An example of this is when some loud mouth mother came to our table and informed us my step-son called her 4 year old daughter a \"ho\". I can guarantee he had no clue what a \"ho\" was and those words never came out of his mouth as he doesn't know anybody who would speak that way. She proceeded to tell her 4 year old that if he said it again for her to say \"your mama's a ho\".  We just laughed at her ignorant remark (especially considering I'm not even his mother), of course that only made her more angry, MWA HA HA HA!!!! Great parenting lady (I use the term lady loosely)...and she had 5 kids with her. I weep for humanity that people like her have 5+ kids.
5. The staff are a bunch of teenage kids. They don't really care but they're not entirely unpleasant either. Just disinterested. 
6. Security sucks, plain and simple. I probably could have smuggled out a kid or two if I had wanted to.
7. This place is dirty and unkempt. I can't even imagine allowing a young toddler to crawl around on the floor. Good lord, what is lurking in the ball pit??? *shudder*
In conclusion, if you like unruly, unattended animal-like children, rude parents, horrible pizza, outdated games and filth this is the place for you! If you have standards, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"We love bringing the kids as we also enjoy the salad bar. Today we show up after 2 to avoid the lunch buffet  and the manager decides the lunch buffet goes till 4. Then they can't even keep pizza on the buffet area, if your staff can't keep up go back to the salad bar that people come to enjoy. Worst visit ever!"}
{"text":"Had my daughters 4th party here. It was a great experience for her. The staff was very helpful. Our party host just went above and beyond. Always asking if we needed anything, always refilling the drinks and helped pass out the cupcakes from the cake. I wish I remembered her name but she was a great party host."}

{"text":"We went here last minute for my nephew's 8th birthday. Michael the manager was very helpful. He did whatever he could to make the birthday special for us. My nephew kept saying it was the best birthday ever!
We will definitely come back!
*also loved that they check the children in and out. Felt very safe."}
{"text":"Wow everytime i come here (i am currently sitting here) it is a wreck. Tables appear to be dirty, cheese shakers not filled, when i asked for a fresh personal pizza the manager seem to have an attitude while telling me there was a buffet. I personally don't eat off of Buffets just one of those things. The floors are dirty I don't think we'll be returning after today's visit."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill despite apparent efforts to appeal to the adults.  When it first opened there were very few menu items, mostly just pizza, and the kids games were liberal with the tickets.  Prizes were reasonably reachable if you stayed long enough and pumped enough money into the tickets.

Now there are more menu choices, all of them fried or high calorie finger food except the salad bar and there are no decent prizes.  The tickets are hoarded unless you happen to be there when Chuckie throws some in the air creating a frenzy to rival walmart on black friday.

This particular location has the absolute worst service of any I have been.  We waited 50 minutes for a luke warm pizza with the cheese not even melted.  It wasn't even very crowded.  The door staff was friendly but the wait staff were rude.  The salad bar was gross with food mixed with other food (obviously from customers dropping it) and food all over the counter.  At least 4 employees walked past it and did nothing to clean it up.  Eventually someone switched out the mixed items but merely pushed the gunk on the counter out of the way dropping some on the floor and leaving it there.

On the plus side, they have recently upgraded their games and at least the photo booth game prints clear photos now instead of the blurry, pixleated black and whites you used to receive."}
{"text":"Megan and her whole crew were awesome! They made my sons birthday very fun and special and Megans customer service skills are excellent. She was also the hardest worker in there. I watched her clean and bus tables, sing happy bday to the kids, unjam a ticket machine for my daughter and work behind the counter taking care of every customers needs with efficiency and a smile on her face.  And she made sure to let us know we should go to her if there were any desires or concerns.  We will definitely be returning as long as she is here.  Thanks Megan and thanks Chuck E. Cheese!"}
{"text":"The kids enjoy the place but it's not too great. Food is bad, every time we were here there's always a few machines out of order, and it is crowded and dirty. We come here for like 30 mins to entertain the kids and leave. We came to a bday party too and the whole party scene is a little more fun as you get some attention from Chuck E. Cheese and kids went nuts. I would never eat here unless I had no choice but we will definitely be back for short period of times for entertainment purposes for the kids."}
{"text":"My family and I just wanted to thank Reyna for doing an outstanding job!  (Sunday, February 19, 11:00 party for Lani.)  She was so patient and helpful.  There was an incident I was not there for and my sister-in-law reported it to Reyna.  Another child (looks to be 4 years of age) kept licking my 5-year-old daughter's arms and called her a name children should not use.  My daughter told my sister-in-law who then told me.  I talked to Reyna and she had already talked to the child's grandmother who apologized about her grandchild's actions and harsh word.  I probably would have made the situation worse if I had witnessed it first hand.  Thanks to Reyna, that did not happen.  My little girl didn't take what the kid said too lightly, mainly because that was the first time she's ever been called that. (She said he called her a \"bidge.\")  But thanks to Reyna's quick train of thought my baby was able to enjoy the rest of her stay at Chuck E. Cheese's.  My family and I just wanted to say, \"Thank You, Reyna!!\""}
{"text":"I've been celebrating my girls birthday parties @this place for 7 years now! But after tonight this will be the last!!!!! The manager by name of Shelly had no customer service what so ever. My party reservation was made with more than a week in advance,  and when I arrived 5 min before the time set, my table wasn't even ready. The food took more than an hour to be brought to my table! It was a very bad experience! The manager not once came to my table to ask if we needed something. The place wasn't even that busy..."}
{"text":"Pretty happy with the experience my son and I had at this location. It was clean and the employees were very sincere with any interaction we had with them. At one point my son was upset because they continued announcing that Chuck E was coming out to say hello but never did. I let a manager know that they should maybe stay away from that announcement during the afternoon hours if they don't plan on having Chuck E come because my son has been waiting for him. The Manager immediately apologized and said Chuck E was coming out right now. No less than 5 minutes later my son got to take a picture with him. Great Manager with great problem solving instead of letting us leave disappointed he fixed the issue. We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"The modern day video arcade for your 3-6 year olds.  The place is clean, they certainly know how to throw a party for a classroom full of kids, and they have a lot of ways for you to drain your wallet.  It's a nice place to have a controlled environment for the kids to run around and play like banshees for a while.

I would love to see a bit more generosity, frankly.  We were there for a classmate's party and were a few minutes late sitting down for lunch.  I guess they charge by the kid?  I'm not entirely sure, but it was like an act of congress for the employee to grab my 4-year old son a cup for lemonade.  

The games are fun, but I did see a few monster shooting games that may be a bit over the top as far as age appropriateness, but overall was a fun time at an okay place for kids to party.

And yes, they still have the animatronic band."}
{"text":"I am actually pretty irritated right now.  We just ordered and the girl (daynna, from recipe) that was helping was actually really nice. I ordered everything paid and started walking away and realized I just paid for a salad bar that they don't even have set up. Um why didn't you tell me this before I paid???
Okay so I bring it up to her attention and she says it will be a salad bar at 2. What the heck, it's noon. I doubt I'll be here in two hours and If I am ill have eaten pizza by then.  She didn't return my money either. I'm furious."}
{"text":"Chuck sad to say you have gone down hill.  Kids wondering around lost without parents, staff that could care less about helping, and ticket machines that break down and no way to redeem tickets.

It's sad because I think that this place has promise and could be making so much more money if they even provided a tiny bit more service.  Parents who need their kids to be entertained will tip a server/entertainer just about anything to help.  

There are so many 16 year olds that need jobs and would be good with kids, just hire a couple and one great manager and you will be making much more money with a much more fun atmosphere.

As for the parents that bring their 2 year olds in there and let them wonder alone (potentially) getting hurt, well staff need to tell those parents watch your kid or you need to leave.  Chuck e should be family fun not a babysitter."}
{"text":"What can I say about Chuck E Cheese's?  Well, the place has not changed much since I visited with my oldest two.  My youngest is 11 now and the GD is 4.  I do not miss having to visit this place.  I will say the kids seemed to have a great time.  I was coaxed to get on the little 3-person carousel...enough said!  I am SO glad I don't have to go back any time soon and I don't plan to.  The less time \"I\" spend in Chuck E Cheese's, the better for me.  However, if you have a little one, let them have some fun!"}
{"text":"Visited this location on a Saturday and it was the typical large crowd because of birthdays. I brought my four year old here and she loved it. There were plenty of arcade games to choose from. There were some games that we had to stand in line for and there were a few that were not working. There were a two arcade games that took the tokens off the card to play but did not start. The staff responded back fast with those incidents and we were able to play the two games that we lost. We were able to find seating as soon as we came in. The pizza was good fast but the cheesy bread was small and overpriced and the salad bar was typical. When I was paying for the food and token/card the computer/register froze twice and I had to swipe my debit card three times and finally on the third attempt the computer worked. This took 20 minutes to process so for the inconvenience the staff gave me an additional 50 tokens which came in handy. We seen Chucky briefly and never seen him again."}
{"text":"We came to this location after moving and we're glad to check in this place. My 5-years-old son really enjoyed his weekend and the tables were clean & the staffs were very friendly. They had a smile and great customer service. On top of that, we had 200 ticket at once for several times! It was lucky day for us!"}
{"text":"Oh Dear Lord!  Can I get a Xanax?!

For us parents this is a necessary evil.  Chuck E Cheese's, in my opinion, as a whole have gone downhill over the years.  It's just not quite what it use to be.  The now robotic Chuck E. makes the experience a little less special and the pizza leaves even more to be desired than it use to.  Nowadays, the staff can make or break your experience.  That and the parenting skills of the other patrons.  Sure, this is a place for your kids to be kids but it's not an excuse to let your child do as they please and run around screaming like an animal.  Do us all a favor and parent your child(ren).

Will I return?  Absolutely!  I know the joy that my daughter gets from this place and I couldn't deprive her of that.  Will we ever have another birthday party there?  No way!  Incredibly overpriced and there's not enough Advil in the world!  The package 'upgrades' add dollars upon dollars to your final bill just to award the children with more plastic trinkets that are broken before the end of the party.  If they survive beyond the party, they are in the trash within a week's time.  

I think the staff is hit or miss here and I think they could do a better job at keeping the place clean.  I also think they need to better position the staff at the front because on countless occasions I've had to stand at the counter waiting to be served.

Why don't you serve beer!?!?!  Other locations do and I knew that would be the only thing to get me through a 6 year old birthday party!  Talk about disappointed!  What are you doing to me?!?!?  Selling beer is like selling sanity to all of the dads in the place!  Easy money!  You're losing out on so much business!  A golden opportunity to gain additional revenue.  Get it together Chuck E."}
{"text":"Use a coupon or three.  Search for online coupons and show them on your phone.

The salad bar is okay.  The pizza crust has changed, once again.  It's thin, and uninspiring.  We asked for extra sauce on the pizza, and it had to be remade.  

I can't justify spending $45 for a large pizza, 4 drinks, 2 salads and 50 tokens again.  Coupons make it a little bit more palatable.  However, if I wasn't being pulled by our 9 year old to this place, I will not go. 

The restaurant is 500% times cleaner than the last time we went there..  maybe 1 year ago.  Great job to the new manager and staff!!"}
{"text":"Went to this location for nieces 6 year bday party and while typical in Chuck E. Cheese fashion we had a birthday table set up which basically comes in a package type option with pizza, drinks, cake and some decorations based on how many people/kids are in the party. 

Overall, this location seemed to be a little cleaner than a couple of others I have been to in the past, prior to yelping days, but of course since its kids galore there is quite the noise level within. 
Many gaming options are available to win tickets to then purchase some toys and prizes. 

As for the food, the salad bar was actually pretty fresh, nothing fancy here but standard salad options. The pizza came out hot and ready to go and the employee's were quick to serve pizza as well as clean up cups and dishes as the party as in progress. They were also great in providing service for the cake and engaging the kids in song and dances. 

Mr. Chuck E. Cheese makes an appearance and gathers the kids and takes them all around the restaurant and then back up to the front for pictures, more song and dances. 

There is also a few TV's and moving puppets playing up front of the birthday tables which are entertaining.  

They do server beer for the adults so that is certainly a plus!"}
{"text":"What do you expect it's Chuck E. Cheese  went there and ordered some wings, the wait was so long(kids were tired by the time the chicken came)  , and they were still raw.  When brought to the attention of the employee they said we could remake them for you, but the kids were ready to leave and they still insisted on not giving our money back. We had to sit for another 30 minutes to wait for this chicken. We asked them to put it in a box to go, when they brought out the box they put the ranch inside uncovered and it was spilled all over the chicken . We asked the guy for a tip for the ranch and he gave an attitude and did it . When we received our box even more ranch was spilled on the chicken and the container with the ranch was just covered in spilled ranch . To top it off we got home and the chicken is still raw ."}
{"text":"Used to go here a lot when little dude was way younger. Went back recently and wow have things gone downhill. 

Every single game we touched was super duper greasy. Two ticket machines were out of order. It took 25 minutes for a medium pizza to come out. During our 90 minute stay not once did we see the Chuckmeister come out and greet the kids. No smiles among the employees working the counter. Just very blah all around. It'd be one thing if we went on a packed Saturday or Sunday afternoon but we were there on a relatively quiet Tuesday night."}
{"text":"A few weeks ago was my little brother's birthday and they made him feel so special. I asked the employees if they could bring chuck e out and do something cute for him and they did. It was a spur of the moment type of thing and the employees happily did it. I really liked that and my family did as well.

I also like how all the games are 1 token each and the kids love it. It can be messy but I easily just ask an employee to wipe a table down for me and it gets done. Prices do seem to be high but the kids love it so I don't fuss about it. The games are funner than Peter pipper's and the pizza is good too. The wait for my food usually takes about 30-40 minutes so while I wait I play games or just enjoy the time with family. It is usually always packed so I would keep that in mind also."}
{"text":"So I went to spend some time with my daughter, my best friend and her son.  Well my mistake!! We arrived and attempted to use our point cards that we had bought and registered in Virginia. Only to find out after several phone calls that you can't use them in other states than where they where bought. The management had no clue who what how or what to do with the cards. No one told me that the management was not trained or educated on the use. Also I was not informed anywhere that they did not transfer state to state. I hope someone @chuckecheese corporate looks into this. I'm out over 100.00just in cards that I bought, let alone what my best friend bought. Hopefully parents read this and only buy what you need. Or better off drive to Dave and busters or somewhere with a better points system and better management."}
{"text":"Why, oh why, does the \"service\" here have to be soooooooooo bad?!?! I challenge you to get past the front rope (where there was no hand sanitizer in the Purell pump btw... GROSS!) and place an order (if you can even get anyone to take your order, that is) and find a table in a timely manor. 

The employees all look like they don't want to be here. They don't smile or make eye contact with anyone, and they magically disappear, leaving their post (whether it be the entrance, the cash register, the ticket redemption, etc) just empty! 

They do have better pizza now then they used to. They serve Pepsi products and a few different beers and wine, which I find odd, but if that's what tickles your fancy, then hey, to each it's own. They even have a Kruig coffee machine for the parental coffee lovers patronizing C.E.C. 
(One star earned on beverage selections)

If you don't have enough tickets, you can always just buy the prize your kid wants instead. So basically a 600 ticket prize is equivalent to $6. They are all WAY overpriced, but that is to be expected. I didn't see any machines out of order today, which is always a pleasant surprise! 
(Second star earned for that)"}
{"text":"Just came here to be a kid again since I never actually got to enjoy it as a kid.

I can say I actually enjoyed myself quite a bit (especially compared to the average 23 year old lol). We played just about everything and I only ended up spending about $20, which is cool. Took some pics with Chuck E, had a few laughs. 

However, the place has a weird mix of smells including feet, and some other uncomfortable mystery smell I can't quite put my finger on. Oh yeah, and pizza.

First tokens I bought shot out of the machine so fast that they started falling on the floor. A little kid about 3 years old started picking up my tokens screaming \"WE BOUGHT THESE THEY'RE MINE\" and for the first time in my life I actually had to parent a stranger's kid and tell him off. The dad just stood there and stared at us. -_- Some people shouldn't reproduce.

Other than that though, I had my first real Chuck-E-Cheese experience and I was pretty damn happy ^_^"}
{"text":"\"Ew.  Children.  Gross.\"

I kid... partially.

I came here with to celebrate my niece's 5th birthday.  Such a milestone!  There were pizza, appetizer samplers, lots and lots of presents, and Chuck E. Cheese makin' it rain tickets on them weetots.  It was rather poetic:  Teaching the next generation that there's nothing free in life --- You gotta scramble around on a dirty floor for it.  

While the pizza is decent and there are enough games to amuse little kids and grown-ups alike, it's a place where there's a lot of yelling and high-pitched voices.  As someone that's short, screams a lot, and has a high-pitched voice, I could get lost in here!  #NotALostChild  #ImAnAdult"}
{"text":"This place is gross!  Noone at the kid check stand when we arrived, when she did come over, she didn't greet us. Then goes back to the cashier stand, again no greeting, just waits for us to order.  So after heading to the table, we noticed how disgusting this place is... only 2 other families here, it's 2:55 pm. But tables and floor is covered in trash. There is napkins stuck to the soda dispenser, sodas out, absolutely nothing in the salad bar except leftover residue.  They can't say lack of workers, I see 11 associates in here.  I asked to speak to the manager just to make him aware thinking maybe he just didn't notice... well he was up at the empty salad bar talking to the cashier.  I get it, young people need jobs, but they also need work ethics!   Hope the hand sanitizer works atleast!  My food was wrong and the kids pizza had a hair.  The manager could not even applogize! I guess everybody in here was having a bad day"}
{"text":"I'm sorry but only 2 stars from me and i considered giving 1.  I will first start out by saying that my kids do enjoy coming in here for the games and they have a good time.  Now the reason for the 2 stars...The staff/staffing here was really bad.  We waited almost 30 minutes to exchange tickets for a prize and there were only 3 people in line.  There was one girl running the prize station and front register.  Than as we were leaving my 3 yr old son walked right past the \"security\" kid at the front door that is supposed to be checking stamps to make sure children are leaving with parents.  I stopped and asked him why he didn't stop my son and he said \"the gate is broken\"  really??  Than i said why do you give your customers this false sense of security with the stamping of wrists if a 3 yr old can walk right out the front door??  A week prior we went in for birthday party and everyone said don't worry about your child, they have great security with the stamps...etc.  Thank God my child didn't get out the door that time.  You should just remove the stamping and just put up a sign that says watch your kids very closely, we aren't responsible (not that anyone should trust a 17 yr old running the door with your child's safety to begin with).  If you visit this location do NOT let your child out of your site as they could very possibly walk out the front door with or without someone!  As i walked out the front door with my child i looked back and said \"you still haven't checked my stamp to make sure he is mine\" and they still did nothing as i walked out with a 3 yr old.  For any management that wants to look into this it was on 5/27/18 around 430-5PM."}
{"text":"Ugh - it's dirty and totally empty- 
Some of the games are broken but still take the new credit system and your money! Definitely must be going out of business soon! Don't waste your time!"}
{"text":"I must admit Chuck E Cheese hasn't been one of my favorite places, Normally only coming for birthday parties in the past, But today I was very pleased, we brought our daughter as a treat and we were very pleased, still on the pricey side, but the pizza has gotten so much better from when we last visited, salad bar filled with plenty of fresh veggies and toppings, and the staff was great, especially the young lady that greeted us at the door (Rebecca) She was a delightful sweetheart that took time out to explain that chuck E Cheese no longers uses coins but prepaid play card. Definitely will be spending many more summer afternoons here."}
{"text":"Just got home from attending a birthday here.  I myself have thrown many bdays at this C.C., however, after today I don't think I could ever recommend this place for a birthday party. 

A friend of my sons was having her 4th birthday party today, when we got there at 10 am, we were told the ovens weren't working.  After waiting for over an hour and having many \"hangray\"  kids, the host asked if they could order pizzas to be delivered, since C.C was unable to fulfill the food order.  The employee told us we were not allowed to do this and that it would be a violation of the contract.  What a joke, a violation of their contract??? They breached first! (but try explaining that to a bunch of teenagers, who have no understanding of a contract.  BTW, it is all kids running this place.  I didn't see 1 person over the age of 21 there working until after 11:00 am). Because C.C. would not accommodate our party, the host decided to move the entire party to Spinatos, where they were more than happy to accommodate us.

In my opinion, I think it is very sad and disappointing.  Chuck E. Cheese markets directly to kids, but then won't put the kids before their own profits.  I believe a better course would have been for them to have allowed the outside food, and kept the kids and parents at their location.  I know for a fact they lost a lot of future business by making the choices they made today. 

Chuck E Cheese if you want to market to kids, you need to put the kids first! (pretty simple)
Shame on you Chuck E Cheese for not doing the right thing."}
{"text":"Went there for my son's birthday (he's 4). The food is over priced for the quality. However,  they do serve beer! :) The games are geared toward little kids which is not an obvious thing but it is nice. All in all this is what you would expect.  No surprises here."}
{"text":"Wow been here 2.5 hours and Chuck E. Finally just came out for a party only. Chuck E should have been out for the kids 5 times already! Instead he's been out none. I just watch two little kids cry because they think Chuck E doesn't like them because he only came out for the party. And now the manager was going to \"see\" if Chuck E could come out for the other kids. Wow this place has gone down hill so bad! Wifi isn't working, game prices are up, no Chuck E. Every half hour like he's supposed to. Now no more tokens just little cards that the kids keep losing track of. Pizza buffet is a joke. Can't keep it restocked. You know it's bad when the kids ask to leave!!!"}
{"text":"dirty carpet salad bar ok and clean.
 frendly service.
2 pizzas 45 minutes great selection on soft drinks by pepsi ...
just need to clean a bit better the dunning area i know kids are super messy. 
check web site for coupons ..."}
{"text":"This Chuck E. Cheese's always happens to be the one we go too. 
We were the first ones there. We got the lunch buffet since I drove from Casa grande  to spend some time with friends and wasn't leaving any time soon.  My kids alway have a great time. The place was clean and the staff was super friendly. 
The food seemed to have improved and as always we had a great time."}
{"text":"I took my 5 year old nephew here several times as it was a fun experience he enjoyed!

We get a pizza, drinks and lots of tokens to win prize tickets so in the end he can score a prize.

This was one of my favorite things to do as I could spend time with my precious Jayden and enjoy the smile on his face while we play the games.

Our last visit was just the three of us, Auntie Nikki, Uncle Chris and Jayden we really had a great time!

The staff is friendly, the food is OK and the games are good and that is what matters.

My only complaint is that it takes a lot of tokens to win prize tickets. I think they could do a lot better with the toys they order from china for ticket redemption. They want a lot of tickets for 99 cent store junk.

This time we had cashed in 1600 tickets for an electric car that was broke when we got home! We took it out of the box and put batteries in it to find that it was broke and would not turn on which sucked! I was not about to break Jayden's heart  so we drove back and they exchanged it for another toy.

Anyways it is a place where a kid can be a kid! :)"}
{"text":"Obviously this place is exciting for the young ones as for the adults adding alcohol made it a lot better,  but very dirty and the help seems very incompetent.  Bring wet wipes and your patience. The kids are all over the place please keep your hand on your kid they can get lost easily. The food is OK so for the adults it's a good place to sit and eat drink and people watch."}
{"text":"My kids love this place.  I'm ok with it but do find the place a little rough around the edges.  The games aren't always functional, it is busy, but overall it isn't bad.  The pizza is actually pretty good and the games are all only 1 token each."}
{"text":"We have come to this location a few times and after our last visit tonight we will not be going again. 

I can overlook the chaos of hosting many families and the staffs' struggle to keep up with it - messy bathroom, broken ticket redemption machines, no ice, scary salad bar.

I can't overlook their failure to keep what should be their primary mission - to offer a safe environment for our children.  When entering we received the numbered hand stamp however when it was time to leave no one was at the entrance to make sure we left in the same group we came in as.  

My four year old was able to leave through the roped off area without any question from their staff as I followed him out, because no one was there!  When we turned around and brought this to the attention of the overwhelmed staff, they told me they were watching the monitor mounted above the door.  Yet, they couldn't explain how we were able to walk on through without confirmation.  

Never again."}
{"text":"Alright Yelpers! 
Woah Chucke E Cheese is a BLAST! Theres only 1 in Calgary and its super easy to get to. 
Transit:
Take the CTrain to Rundle Station and walk towards The Bay in Sunridge Mall. Google maps says its a 17 min walk from Rundle to ChuckE E Cheese ut it only took us 5. Its open until 10pm on Sunday so the mall was closed when we headed. Theres a nice path going around the side of the bay to follow and leads you right to the restaurant!

Norm and I dont have any kids but I was stoked to go for my birthday - kinda expensive. 
Food :
We got a combo one - med pizza/2 drinks/ 20 tokens for $40 and added the salad bar for an additional $18. Everything was fresh ans yummy. Ordered Cheese Bread for $8 which is just a 6\" pizza with cheese folded in half and cut into 4 pieces and comes with ranch dip - it was good but totally overpriced.
System runs pretty smoothly. You order, they give you a number, you stick it to your table and they bring it out. Alao the pop is free refills that you fill yourself. 
Salad bar was good but we didnt eat enough to make ot worth the price, would not get it again but it was nice.

Layout:
The first 1/3 is \"older kids games\" / The second 1/3 is \"toddler games\" / The third 1/3 is birthday party time. We went at 8pm on a sunday and it wasnt too busy. I like that all the games are 1 token. My fav was the shooting hoops game and Norm loved the fast&furious driving game. 

And on friday&saturday there open until 11pm!  

All in all it was an awesome night. We had a blast and would go back for sure. Expect maybe next time eat before we go and just buy pop and tokens :)"}
{"text":"Not a lot of ppl.  3 different birthday parties have come and gone and we are still here. Very clean. Good food. Great service. Love the new play pass. My kids had a great time. We came for my youngest 3rd birthday and kids enjoyed themselves.  I complaint no crying . Will defínete come again"}
{"text":"The food is not that bad considering it is Chuck E Cheese and I must say it is always clean or being cleaned for the amount of kids that are always there. I wish it was a little less packed. Its almost too packed. I might try the one near the Grand Canyon Plaza and 215. Our kids always have a great time and I love that they serve Gluten Free Food (the reason for my 4 star rating). That is VERY thoughtful of them. It would be nice if they also had organic options but I may be pushing it."}
{"text":"Meh. I have a 7 year old and a lot of nieces. Food is expensive here, you're better off taking your kids else where, like Pump It Up. You get a private room and no other random kids from out of nowhere running around in your party area. This place is just sloppy and they took my plate away, I was still eating. 

However, Their games are cheap, a lot of games take 1 token and you can print coupon for token's online. 

I just wouldn't spend $500 here for a party,  mediocre food and a rat mascot."}
{"text":"Most of the machines usually work. I have a 5 year old that likes to come, and has a good time. I have never eaten here so I can't comment on the food. The prices for the games are much better then other places with the same type of business. We can come in, spend $5 and play for quite a while, mixing in the climbing tubes. It's a cheap fun night out for the little one. 

As others have stated the cleanliness leaves something to be desired. It also doesn't help when the machine your kid is looking forward to using is broke. But for $5 go try it out."}
{"text":"Highlights - It was clean, well lit, and child safety regarding entry/exit was superior. 

Pepperoni pizza was pretty good and salad bar looked great. Traditional buffalo wings (bone in) were tasty. I would order again. 

Not so high points - Sampler Platter was a huge disappointment. One small handful of French fries, 5 wings, that's it, and a slab of cheesy bread, which no one touched.  

Service was very slow. Took way too long to get food. Tables all around us not cleared.  Diet Pepsi tasted terrible."}
{"text":"One of the worst establishments iv ever been to. Came in on a Saturday night around 5pm, it was full big kids mostly African Americans, and Mexicans, we were the only white people there. All my kid wanted to do was go up the jungle gym thing and it was over packed with older kids, they were running around trampling kids and cussing like sailors. I tried bringing this to attention to the management but they didn't do anything. Over packed and crowded and half the games didn't even work or stole your money and or gave you no tickets after winning. Stay away from this one. Trust me I'm not some old dad who's just bitter. I'm young and this place just blows!!"}
{"text":"I'm a frequent chuck e cheese visitor having 3 little ones this is there favorite place! But the last few visit have been more then unpleasant at this location there was two managers I spoke with today first being the female manager that seemed if she couldn't be bothered to take my order very rude an snappy during the whole order. When my ticket came out for the 50% an the 500 tickets she threw it away with out asking if I wanted an no its not important its the point. When I spoke with the next manager about it he also had the same terrible attitude an said we had to ask or else they don't give them out I've never had to ask before this place really lacks customer service! Will not be returning here the lake mead location  might always be crowded but they know how to treat there customers!"}
{"text":"I had my daughter's 5 year old birthday party and our host Alyssa was awesome! She was very friendly and extremely helpful. Anytime I needed anything especially adding kids to my party, she was quick to respond. The party went smoothly and Alyssa did a great job at controlling the kids and getting them to participate. This location was clean and to be honest, we come here a lot and it's always a good time. Unlike their other location in Spring Valley where a lot of the machines are broken. The party was done in about an hour and a half and moved very quickly but not to the point that we felt rushed. With kids, it makes sense to keep things moving or else they would probably get bored. Price was not bad. Everyone had a great time, especially the birthday girl."}
{"text":"This chuck e cheese is pretty new, yet it still seems dated. They have yummy pizza (today that is) and they really upped their game with the salad bar. 
I celebrated my nephews birthday here & their service was okay. They passed out the cake yet forgot to pass out the ice cream that we had paid for. They also had paid for the pull string pinata & the string broke so the girl had to open it manually. Which took away from the experience. 
All together it was okay & decent. I dont like that they charge tax for the tokens. So its 3 tokens for $1.00! Hopefully they upgrade a little bit of everything as time moves on."}
