{"text":"The food was ok. The service was very bad, not even one waiter would smile. They were trying their very best to make you feel very unwelcome even the place was pretty empty.

The decor was old and out of touch. The live entertainment was a guy playing a digital piano and a woman singing Italian songs. Nothing very exciting. As for their clientele, unrefined."}
{"text":"Weekday lunch. The place is pretty quiet and decor is outdated.  Tasty but tiny portions for $20. They should at least give you an appetizer salad with it or a larger portion. Disappointing. It will go out of business soon."}
{"text":"A very nice dinner for 4. Delicious Italian meal. This was our second time eating there and it was just as good as we remembered.
Vitello Picatta, Lemon Veal was excellent. Seared medium rare. Really good.
3 colour Gnocchi in a gorgonzola and walnut sauce. So tasty.
It is in an industrial area and really is a premium lunch restaurant, so we enjoy having very few fellow customers for an evening dinner, very intimate.
$200 including wine, dessert, tax and tip. A good value for good food!"}
