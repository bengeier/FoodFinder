{"text":"Hipster vile up in here.. Good dogs and cheap beer, I'll give it another try next time I'm in mood to having out with a bunch of cool hipsters !"}
{"text":"If you like hot dogs you MUST go to Happy Dog.  I suggest you go hungry. The dogs are the best and the toppings are over the top (pun intended).  Seriously, you must try it.  They only do hot dogs and they do them extremely well.  Great service, yummy food, casual atmosphere and later in the evening all types of live music.  This is a go to spot for me, once you try it, it will be for you too."}
{"text":"Happy Dog exceeded my expectations.  4 adults and 5 kids (3yrs to 14yrs) went there for lunch and we all loved it.  The dogs were great, the tater tots were great and the beer selection was great.  Our server was very helpful accommodating each of the children and their never-ending requests.  We'll be heading back soon."}
{"text":"If you're looking for something different Happy Dog is definitely the place! You can almost literally get whatever you want on a hot dog, veggie dog, tots, and fries. My food was good I had a hot dog with bacon and Mac N Cheese it could have been hotter though I'm not really a fan of luke warm food!  If your bring a group they add a gratuity and will not split checks!"}
{"text":"Great veggie dogs. One of the coolest places in Cleveland."}
{"text":"This place rules! The hot dog and tater tot toppings are awesome! They have a great draft beer selection and a variety of liquor as well."}
{"text":"The hotdogs were interesting and good. Lots of tasty combinations. The service was good too. Worth a visit if your a hotdog fan."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Great beer selection, great atmosphere and the food is amazing. Love the innovative and tasty hot dog toppings. I get the vegan dog and it's the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"I used to really enjoy Happy Dog, but we had a horrible experience this evening.  I took a group of friends from out of state, which included 2 children.  We arrived just after 8pm and we were ignored.  Since no staff came to our table, I explained how the menu and ordering worked and we each completed our orders as waiters avoided our table like the plague.  Finally after staring at the staff for over 10 minutes, a waiter came ovrr and said food service stopped at 9pm, even though it was only after 8pm.  He then said if we wanted food we had to go to the bar.  Confused by this, my friend grabbed our order cards and went to the bar, where he was again disregarded by the staff.  This was a horrible experience and we left and ended getting great service at another restaurant, so it looks like we will not be returning to Happy Dog."}
{"text":"Hotdogs and tater tots.   Thats all you need to know. If you have a love for these two things and toppings that you could dream to put on them, the Happy Dog is your dream. Take a check list and check all the toppings, and condiments your heart desires.  Ill only hit on the great quality of the dogs and toppings since there are so many to mention. I went for lunch so I didnt drink, but there is also an impressive drink list. Id imagine this would be a better place to drink with the boys and drunkenly creat hotdog bliss rather than take the GF on a date (like I did haha) GO here!"}
{"text":"Happy Dog is certainly a hyped-up establishment right now, and while I am definitely a fan, I still haven't had that amazingly, awesome experience that everyone else seems to have! I think it's slightly overrated as an 'it' place, but either way, I continue to go back, and would recommend it to anyone looking for a chill, laid-back bar, so long as you don't mind that hipster vibe.  I've only ever sat at the bar, and service is always solid... attentive, friendly, and my drink is always full. This really goes a long way for me... I bartend myself, so I know what excellent service is and I swear by the notion that a simple smile goes a long way! Great beer selection, too.  Food- Gotta love the American authenticity of a good 'ol hot dog! Definitely comfort food for me! Yes, I tend to go into a slight food coma afterwards, but it is so worth it!   Bottom line- It's a great place, but I think it is a little over-rated in the hipster-cool department."}
{"text":"I'm not normally a fan of hot dogs but this place is incredible!  Great selection of beer, bands and overall cool vibe."}
{"text":"This is a great place to have unique bar food, but the problem is going there and their is some shitty band you don't even want to hear, and you can't go in unless you pay a door cover to hear their shitty Mashup of the smith's and Weezer that they started in their garage last Wednesday"}
{"text":"They have an abundance of toppings for their dogs but just one type of sausage and bun. Cleveland has enough of a variety of sausages (Southern and Central Europe as well as Latin American options come to mind) to change this and upgrade the place easily. I don't know why they don't do it. They spent time to come up with interesting toppings, so why not more sausages? Involve customers in creating sausage-topping-bun combos? I could love that place but this way it is a solid ok with a lot of potential. Better hipster places around."}
{"text":"Let me start this off by saying I am a fan of Happy Dog. Going to school in Cleveland, friends and I would stop by to get a drink and a dog. After being gone for a year,my friend and I were looking forward to experiencing a little bit of nostalgia.  However...  It took ANY bartender 10 minutes to actually acknowledge our presence there. No one asked \"have you been served yet?\" There were only about 5 people at the bar in total, and many times one female bartender went by us without saying anything (she didn't seem busy at all!)  The food here...is great as always, but c'mon. It shouldn't take this long to wait on an order. Thank goodness the food comes out fast.   I planned on leaving at least a $20 tip, but after this fiasco, I couldn't bring myself too. Now, the funny thing is, after we got our food a rambunctious group of mid 30-year olds with their significant others came in the bar and sat right next to us. And how long did it take them to get their orders? About 10 seconds. The female bartender went right up to them and played nice.  I get it, my friend and I don't look like the richest, or the most successful of people, but looks...can be deceiving.   Moral of this story? Please, treat all customers the same."}
{"text":"Simple concept. Amazingly done. Try the blue cheese slaw!"}
{"text":"When friends come to visit, we take them to Happy Dog.  Every one of them has loved it.  The food is great.  I'm a vegetarian, but I've been super impressed by their vegan sausages and the sheer number of wonderful toppings and sauces.  We love the garlic aioli and their homemade ketchup.  I love coming up with fun, gourmet combinations every time we come.  The tater tots are wonderful and it's fun to try them with all of the bunches of sauces.  They have music and trivia and things almost every night of the week.  It's always busy, especially on weekends.  They have a downstairs bar area that they open up for more space.  Great beer selection.  We love the Happy Dog."}
{"text":"Wunderbare Eckkneipe mit Bühne auf welcher lokale Grössen Blues, Folk und Rock zum Besten geben.   Berühmt ist das Happy Dog für seine, naja, Hotdogs eben und die unendliche Liste der dazu passenden Toppings.   Diverse Biere vom Fass, auch deutsche Flachenbiere (zB Jever) sind hier in netter angenehmen Atmosphäre zu haben.  Immer wieder gerne hier! http://www.happydogcleveland.com"}
{"text":"love this place. kept passing it by on my way to my sister in laws house. one day decided to go in. they have trivia, and live music. but the hot dogs and tater tots...so good. what is even better is that they have veggies dogs. Happy dog has many options for you to dress up your hot dog, so the possibilities are endless."}
{"text":"The Happy Dog has switched over to an all hot dog menu. The dogs are $5 and you have a choice of about 40 different toppings. Some of the wilder ones are chunky peanut butter, alien pickle relish, baby bok choy coco cola stir fry, oaxacan red chile and chocolate mole. All the standard toppings are available as well. Veggie dogs are also available. You can get sides of fried french fries and tater tots.  They also come with a variety of sauces and toppings. You order you dogs from something that resembles a sushi order sheet. This is a great neighborhood spot."}
{"text":"A clever and no-frills little establishment where you can choose from a decent selection of beers and have some food while listening to some very good musical acts.  Although this is basically a bar, the concept of limiting the menu to five-dollar hot dogs and 2.50 tater tots, each with a variety of crazy toppings and sauces to combine at will, makes for fun bar snacks and also family-friendly ones if you need to bring the kids or your aged parents along.  There's also a Pac-Man table and old-fashioned pinballs in case the kids, or you, need further amusement.   Although I tend to be the boring person who only gets one topping on my dog or goes for the good ol' ketchup-mustard-relish, it's fun to see what crazy combos my pals come up with, and once in a great while I will even try one myself.  You wouldn't think that chocolate mole and onions, or fried egg and potato chips, would be good slathered all over a hot dog unless you tried it.  And, at the low low prices, you aren't out too much if you don't like your choice.    In contrast to Melt, another restaurant that's jazzing up a relatively humble kiddie food, you can usually get a table at the Happy Dog pretty fast (except when there's some hugely popular band show happening), and the Happy wait staff are prompt and pleasant with a minimum of hipster 'tude.  I wouldn't call this the venue with the best beer selection in Cleveland area - that honor probably goes to Now That's Class - but there's generally enough interesting microbrews and seasonals available to capture my attention.  Four stars instead of five because most of the seating is bar stools even at tables, which are not the most comfortable for a meal-length visit (there's a very few booths), and because there's no parking lot, street parking only.  Which means you might have to hike a couple blocks through bad weather, past dodgy denizens of the 'hood, and the cops get a little jiggy with the parking tickets sometimes.  It's still well worth a visit, especially for music heads who want a little interesting food and drink with their tunes."}
{"text":"Great food and beer selection. Cool atmosphere. I love that they have vegan options but unless you go in and drink/eat, it's near impossible to call an order in :("}
{"text":"AWESOME HOT DOGS AND TATER TOTS! Great live music. Bar downstairs is great if you want to get away from the crowd and play some pinball. Staff is very courteous, and beer selection is VERY solid."}
{"text":"Full disclosure: I am an acquaintance or friend of nearly everyone on the Happy Dog's front end. But even before I got to know the staff, I fell in love with this bar. I've never really been one to have a \"regular\" place because I've always valued anonymity, but there's definitely a cozy element to the Happy Dog that I haven't found anywhere else. The food is delicious (and cheap!), and the unique combinations on the menu make for some exciting choices.  They also have a lot of premium beers on tap, including Scrimshaw, Mirror Pond Ale, and Fat Head's Bumbleberry.   9 times out of 10, the live music is an asset to the atmosphere. I've seldom seen bad performances at the Dog, and it's been a spot for a LOAD of great Cleveland bands. Monday Night Trivia is also enjoyable and has proven to be an effective way of decompressing after a stressful work day.  I highly recommend this place to locals AND tourists. There's no place on earth like it.  (P.S. The pinball machines should also get a mention. The Dog is a regular spot for the Cleveland Pinball League, so the games are satisfyingly challenging and they switch them out every so often. As of this writing, Attack From Mars is my favorite. I've spent many, many quarters in these machines and I certainly urge you to do the same.)"}
{"text":"A 3-Star review is described as A-OK. That is about how I felt about Happy Dog, a much hyped spot on Cleveland's west side. The concept was fun but as I've seen in other reviews, the extensive list of toppings is a hinderance to this place having a signature identity in my opinion. It's good grub, but not a place I would go out of my way to get again. If I happened to be in the area I might get it but there are fantastic options not far down the road.  In terms of a national comparison, Hot Doug's, a Chicago institution I have also reviewed, is the king in this niche industry of hot dog cuisine with a twist. At Hot Doug's, sauces, cheeses, and toppings are paired specifically with each variety of sausage to create memorable flavors that you find yourself craving later on.  There are suggested combinations apparently but I was not aware of this during my visit as I was only handed a menu with the list of toppings. I went with a dog topped with mac and cheese, siracha sauce, chili, and a fried egg. It was good but again, nothing overly memorable or that I felt I couldn't replicate exactly.  Overall, worth a look if you're in the area but not worth driving out of your way for."}
{"text":"Who would have though such a simple menu and venue could work in such a fantastic way?  The hot dogs are awesome, the tater tots too.  And the Happy Dog brings in some of the best indie music around.  Great job!!"}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Happy Dog since the beginning...even before Eric Williams put his mark on it..love the old bar stools and DJ Kishka!"}
{"text":"Great place to throw a few brews back while eating an inexpensive, high quality hotdog. My only complaint about the hotdog is the bun. Everyone's bun broke within seconds of taking a bite. They should have an option to toast/heat the bun to reduce this and enhance the deliciousness. Minor flaw... On a positive note the ingredients are fresh and creative. The service was extremely fast and the beer options were superb. I quenched my thirst with a Bells Two Hearted Ale which was on tap.   Overall, this place is the definition of a dive and provides a relaxed, fun environment especially with the live music and friendly staff. They should look into updating their tables/chairs but perhaps that would take away from the character of the place. Check it out!"}
{"text":"I regret tat we discovered this place so late in my time here in Cleveland.   You may be thinking that hot dogs are a bit low brow, but Happy Dog make a quality product with an amazing taste!  There are tons of options and a great beer selection.  You need to go."}
{"text":"I'm not really sure how I feel about Happy Dog.. And I'm not really sure if I'd ever come back.  To start, service here is sllooowwwww. Not bad, but slow. Slow as in waiting probably ten minutes to be acknowledged at the bar and then waiting equally as long after to get our order sheet taken. Mind you, it was fairly busy on a Saturday afternoon, but that's really no excuse for those wait times.  One plus? The pretty extensive beer selection. They had a pineapple cider (who knew one even existed?) as one of there featured drinks and it was kind of life changing. Actually, it was the highlight of my Happy Dog adventure.  On to the food. Tater tots are good. I would definitely order those and probably only those if I came back. There is a huge amount of dipping options. Bloody mary ketchup (which could very well be cocktail sauce), coffee barbeque, and black truffle mustard were pretty decent.   The hot dogs..... Just okay. The concept is neat--customizable gourmet hot dogs. The choice of toppings is certainly unique--cheetohs, fruit loops, fried egg, etc. However, the hot dog itself was just not good and dare I say even low quality. Also, if you load your hot dog up, it's going to fall apart. I added only three toppings--cheddar cheese, bacon, and a fried egg--to mine and mine split in half. It became a messy ordeal to say the least.   Might be back... But probably not."}
{"text":"This place is a Cleveland classic.  I've been coming here since before the current owners evolved it into the Happy Dog we now know and love.  Since the days they served homemade pierogies and other ethnic eats.  But, the change has been great to see.  Food - Hot Dogs with your choice of 50 toppings and tater tots.  And sometimes burgers.  And sometimes special tasting menus.  Fabulous!  Chimichurri is my favorite dipping sauce for the tots.  Service - Not that I've verified this, but they may have the longest bar in Cleveland.  Service is always great here. Beer selection is amazing.  Music - This place gets some great bands from all over the country.  I've seen all types of music and talents on their tiny stage. Always a great time.  Ambiance - Feels like a 1950's basement.  In a good way. Without the musty smell. When times were simpler and all there was to do was hang out with your friends and catch up. In person. Very welcoming.     Misc.- Monday night is Trivia Night.  Always fun!"}
{"text":"A M A Z I N G  Full list of awesome toppings to go on your dog or veggie dog! You can also get tots or fries with a few of the choice toppings, as well. Great spot to hang out with friends, enjoy a dog and a cold beer."}
{"text":"We went here because of what we heard about the hot dogs.  What we heard was more than true!  The best dogs I have ever eaten came out of Happy Dog's kitchen.  The price is perfect and the variety of toppings is almost staggering!  You absolutely have to go here if you are looking for a great hot dog!!"}
{"text":"it's a one of a kind place ...nothing comparable - friendly and open with live music often in the evenings,  for whatever reason someone came up with the idea of doing lectures there over beers - wish I had a professor like that back in the day - the hot dog ingredients listing is massive and you'll likely not run out of imaginative combo's - tater tots go great and lots of dips - bar is stocked and beer choices abound - stop reading and just go"}
{"text":"Good food with a high trendy price. I am impressed by the meat, toppings, and side dishes . Bit of a downside is the cheap bun used for the $5 hotdog. If you enjoy loud music most of the week, it's the place to be to eat a $5 hotdog. If your looking for some good French fries, it's the place to be .   My biggest reason for this review is the bad customer service . I have noticed an overall lack of good bar/restaurant customer service in the \"hip\" restaurants. An overall lack of enthusiasm, greeting, smiles, cleaning, busing, and care for the customer. I have eaten at happy dog over ten times , with horrible customer service  each time. It is not professional to have monotone sluggish employees asking people what they want . I can honestly say I will never eat or drink there ."}
{"text":"Favorite spot in Cleveland -- no doubt. Great hot dogs (the veggie sausage is fantastic), awesome booze selection and great vibe. Polka happy hours are also where it's at. If I lived above the Happy Dog, I'd weigh 250 lbs. Absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Awesome hipster hot dogs and music. Great drink selection, fun dingy yet comfortable vibes, and vegan/ GFree options available!"}
{"text":"If I were a condemned man, and had to pick one last meal before getting strapped into \"Old Sparky,\"  it would be a hot dog and tots from the Happy Dog.  I've been to the Happy Dog about 50 times since discovering it a little over a year ago.  Each and every time, I have a great experience!  The Food - The menu couldn't be more straightforward, or more overwhelming all at the same time.  There are 4 main items: hot dogs, shockingly good veggie dogs, tater tots and fries.  Easy enough.  However, there are 50 really great toppings to chose from, in any quantity and combination you want.  Ketchup and mustard?  Check!  Peanut butter and spicy jelly? Check.  Bacon, egg, cheese with chipotle hollandaise?  Check!  For first timers, I suggest you follow the \"Suggestive Wieners\" cards, as you tend to experience some sort of \"topping overload\" with your first dog.  Then, work your way around the menu.  And at some point...do try peanut butter on a dog...it's shockingly good!  Really!  The Bar - The bar is well stocked with dozens of great draft beer selections, and the coolers have dozens more in cans and bottles.  They also have an extensive liquor selection.  Their Sunday Bloody Mary selection is top notch! Perfect for a little \"hair of the dog\" on a Sunday morning.  Despite the great selection of beers, my barley soda of choice is almost always the 16oz can of PBR.  Yes, I know it's the hip, new, old, beer that the kids are drinking today in their \"cool-guy hats,\" (of which I am not one of them!)  And I'm normally a beer snob, but it just \"seems right\" to be drinking a PBR and scarfing down a dog.  The Staff - The staff at the Happy Dog couldn't be nicer!  They are always on their game, no matter how crazy crowded this place gets.  Always friendly and helpful and the service is generally very fast.  When it's a bit slower, like a weekend lunchtime, the bartenders are very friendly, and talk to you as if you are their best customer...even if it's your first time there.  The Entertainment - This is a really fun place to see a band.  While a little small, and you're practically on-top of the stage if you're in once of the booths or floor seats...or 1/4 of the bar seating, for that matter...it's a really great place for live music.  A great mix of music too...blues, honky-tonk country, rock...I think they even had members of the Cleveland Orchestra playing one night!    And, of course, for the \"Polka Happy Hour with DJ Kishka.\"  Once a month, a local musician transforms himself into the great \"DJ Kishka\" and spins old polka records for 3 hours.  Think it sounds lame?  Then stay away.  It's without question, the silliest thing I have ever seen.  The crowd is great, a mix of 20-somethings on up to 80 year old Polish grandparents...everyone singing and drinking...and drinking.  But a warning for the kids!  Kishka \"works blue\" after about an hour, so please...stay at home.  It is a bar, after all...who brings kids to a bar?    I love this place!  A true Cleveland gem!"}
{"text":"Tasty dogs!  And Tater Tots too!  The combos are endless. The dog with chorizo chili & cheddar was very tasty.  The Michael Simon favorite. .peanut butter alien relish and sirachi...VERY GOOD.   Who thinks of these? ?? A must try.  If all else fails, there's always a ton of beer to wash it down with!"}
{"text":"More than anything, I love Happy Dog because of its versatility--for a place with one entree, they do a great job of drawing people back again and again for their ever-changing beer selection, live music, and support for/participation in local events.  I'm too indecisive to sift through the hot dog toppings menu on a regular basis, though I have had hot dogs there a few times and enjoyed them. I recently tried the vegan sausage option and will definitely get that from now on--I was a little apprehensive, because I know meat substitutes can be hit-or-miss, but I felt like the vegan dog was more flavorful than a regular one.  The tater tots are my favorite snack there, although sometimes I've experimented with dipping sauces and can't quite get one with the right dipping consistency. (First world problems are the worst world problems, am I right?) However, they couldn't be more generous with the amount of options they'll offer for a blanket price.  The bartenders are great on the whole. Sometimes you can tell that they get a little frazzled, and understandably so for some of the crowds they have to deal with.  The only thing that really annoys me about HD is when I'm trying to stop in for a beer and someone asks me to pay a cover at the door for a band I've never heard of and have no interest in seeing. I get that they're about live music and I have heard some good bands there, but I wish they had a better way of accommodating those who are there primarily for the bar/restaurant and those who are there primarily for the music when the two overlap (I have The Winchester's model in the back of my head). It's not like there aren't other bar/restaurant options within walking distance, it's just that it seems a little silly for me to take my business elsewhere when I wanted to give it to HD (but not a cover band or whatever)."}
{"text":"I went to happy dog with my family last weekend and I had so much fun. On my hot dog I got cheese,chili,spagetiohs,cream cheese and nacho cheese. It was very yummy. We also got Tator tots. When I got my hot dog it looked humungous. I tried it and it was very good. Also my waitress was very nice. It was very cheap too."}
{"text":"We went early on Saturday with our kid. There was another kid there and an infant. My poppy seed hot dog bun was in two pieces and the dog was cold. Kid thought it sucked  because a) poppy seeds b) casing on the dog. My guy who would make an excuse for you if you ran over his toes with your car, when asked says \"I wouldn't go back soon\". We spent $39.74 for three dogs 2 orders of fries, 1 order of tater-tots, 2 bottles of Labatts, one coke, one blue frostie soda and one draft Stella Artois plus $8.00 tip. I feel a little greasy and smell like a fryer. Cigarettes smell better."}
{"text":"The toppings and such to choose from are pretty cool. They have all sorts of things you can put on your hot dog. It would be helpful if they had some presets since most of the toppings were a little out there. The tator tots were very good and the ambiance was nice and staff friendly."}
{"text":"This is as good as hot dogs get. For those of you that don't know the formula here: $5 for a hot dog and as many toppings as you can handle from an 50-item list. If you still don't understand, allow me to give you one of my favorite combinations: hot dog with pickle, bacon, gouda, nacho cheese, spaghetti o's, fritos corn chips, and chili. Their fries and tater tots are also great ($3) which have a similar slew of toppings to choose from.  The wait staff is good although table service ends in the late afternoon and you have to go to the bar for service. The beer list is also great, with a large number of beers on tap that change regularly. Also, for the vegetarians out there they do have veggie dogs and most of the their 50 toppings are vegetarian, so no worries.  The atmosphere can be a little overwhelmingly hipster, but it is still endearing, with it's tiny stage and pinball machines in the corner. If there is live music the night you go, expect a cover.   Overall, a place not to be missed if you find yourself in Cleveland."}
{"text":"This place is rad!!  get the mobile home wrecker dog, for sure... bourbon baked beans, caramelized onion, Alabama white BBQ sauce & Andy's hot fries :)-  sounds crazy but they don't pile the toppings so high that you can't eat it. it was even awesome to go.  I almost went for the spagettiOs, but wanted a house made topping instead. Maybe next time, yes, there will be a next time. I prefer the tots to the fries, we topped em with nacho cheese and cheddar. they were crispy, but soft in the middle! Very kind, attentive service and the drinks were not weak nor overpriced."}
{"text":"My friend brought me here when I came into town to visit her. I really wanted to love it but the staff left a bad taste in my mouth.  Food: The hot dogs were delicious and HUGE, even without the mountain of toppings. I got a dog with chili, mac & cheese and caribbean slaw, and we split tots and fries on the sides (which included delicious dips and sauces). Unfortunately there was so much on the dog and it was so wet from the chili that the bun broke in half so I had to eat it with fork and knife.  Staff: Here's where my issue was... We arrived at 8:45 on a Saturday to a sign saying they would start charging a cover for the band at 9. We didn't really gripe because we thought we'd stick around and listen, so we paid our $15 and proceeded to a table. We were then told that table service ended at 9 (again, it wasn't 9 yet) so we'd have to order from the bar. There weren't even 10 people in the bar even by the time we left, so it was sort of ridiculous that none of the 3 bartenders twiddling their thumbs could have served us or offered to refill our waters, but I digress. What really put me over the edge was that the band came out around 9:30, played ONE SONG for their sound check, and didn't make another appearance by the time we left at 10. We asked the [very bored-looking] doorman for our cover charge back when we left since we arrived before 9 AND the band didn't start, and without a shred of empathy he just said, \"Nah, can't do that.\"  So, come for a hot dog. The flavors are on point, though the overall dog can't really be eaten like a true hot dog. Don't expect the staff to be overly friendly or helpful if you come later in the evening."}
{"text":"This is our favorite place to stop if we want to go out to dinner but not spend a lot. You can easily be full on one of the hot dogs and splitting some tots. Even though I'm no longer a vegetarian, the veggie dogs here are WAY better than their meaty counter part. The first time I went I thought I would need two dogs so we both got our own veggie and regular hot dog and split tater tots.  Halfway through the first dog I realized that I way over estimated how much I could eat here. I have yet to be there when there is a band playing, in fact we generally try to avoid it because I've heard it can get very crowded.  Look at their website to see if there's a band if you're just going to have dinner."}
{"text":"I love this place so much I ended up going three times in three days.   Others have described it, but in short, you fill out an order sheet to your own toppings on your meat or vegan hot dog ($5, with unlimited free toppings!) I usually get the veggie chili, vodka sauerkraut, caramelized onions, \"alien relish\" (it's BRIGHT green. Like, think a drunk on St. Patrick's Day) and then one or two new things.   The tater tots and fries are $3 with unlimited free dipping sauce, but $1 per topping. Still well worth it for the veggie chili.  The tap list is great, and while relatively expensive for Cleveland, about right for similar beer bars.   I love the covered bike parking shed on the side street (54th) but hate that Happy Dog employees use it as their smoking hut.   It does get busy at night and on weekends, but can be worked out."}
{"text":"I stopped in here on a recent cold winter's night for some beers and a dog. I had the vegan dog with sauerkraut and black truffle honey mustard. I think it was the best hot dog of my life. They use Field Roast vegan dogs for you vegan sausage connoisseurs. My friend got the tater tots with a few of their many dipping sauces and the ones I tried were very tasty as well. The beer selection was excellent- a good range of local and not-so-local microbrews. The service was friendly and fast."}
{"text":"This place is the best - only if - you like a casual, eclectic crowd, fabulous dogs and a no frills atmosphere. My kind of place. I'm in from Chicago and have to tell you - this is the best hot dog place I've ever been to. Full bar, great staff and AMAZING hot dogs (ask for the \"chefs special\" list of dogs...who knew peanut butter and dogs were a combo made in heaven). My 85 year old mom and I had the best time. PLEASE COME TO CHICAGO!"}
{"text":"We've been here many times and loved it but I was appalled tonight when we showed up to get take out and were going to be charged $15 (there were 3 of us) just to enter the building. So instead of making a quick $30 off of us, they got nothing. Smart business plan. Don't think I'll be back anytime soon. Not a fan of stupid business owners."}
{"text":"I don't know exactly what it is that I love so much about Happy Dog, but this is definitely one of my favorite places in CLE.  Maybe it's the dive-y atmosphere, maybe it's the great selection of beers, maybe it's those tots - whatever it is, it keeps pulling me back for more.   I will say that I've never ordered a hotdog from this place (a sin, i know!) but I've done the drinks and the tots (including the never ending list of dipping sauces) and they're both freaking awesome.    I've always had great service here and honestly, it beats my expectations for a place that can get incredibly packed and has more of a bar feel than restaurant.  I've never waited long for a food order, nor has any group I've been with, and if the crowd isn't too large you can have some pretty great conversations with one of the many awesome bartenders.    Again, I'm not sure what it is that keeps luring me back so if you want see why I love this little place so much I guess you have to experience it for yourself.  The bf and I have taken plenty of out of towners to Happy Dog and every single one of them has always made it a point for us to take them back.  There's something about it, now you just need to go to find out!"}
{"text":"I've always been a hot dog fan, so this is a new favorite place of mine. The hot dog itself is amazing, but there are so many different toppings to try! I have to try them all! Decent beer selection and a fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"I am so impressed that even though there wasn't much room to stand when we went to celebrate Dingus Day, the bartenders were quick and friendly - even when people squirted water at them and thrashed them gently with pussy willows.  They are the most professional corner dive bar servers one can imagine. What an experience!"}
{"text":"I've never thought hot dog can be taste like this. SO many combination means endless surprise~"}
{"text":"Best hot dogs I've ever had! I wanna come here many more times to try different combinations of toppings. Beers are fine. The vibe is great with good music. Bartenders are friendly and so is the crowd. My favorite bar in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Hot dog, tater tots and a couple a beers for $10, yes please.  Throw in a kick ass selection a of toppings, many of which they make themselves, solid beer selection (although I tend to stick to the PBR tallboys), wonderful bar wenches, and a great venue for local bands and I don't need to much convincing to show up any given night.  Great trivia night on Monday, although not for the faint of heart.  Go with the chorizo chili, nacho cheese sauce and grilled onions, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"So I visited the Happy Dog for the 1st time Friday July 5 after going to see the Tall Ships exhibit downtown I had an urge for a Hot Dog...maybe because of the food they had at the exhibit....anyway my friend suggested I hold out as they had a great spot in mind for awesome Hot Dogs.....well to my surprise I never heard of Happy Dog until that day.....well needless to say I was very satisfied and will definitely be back again....I was impressed by the way you placed your order.....you see they have these menu strip sheets where you mark off what you want on your hot dog and I must say some of the toppings maybe a little strange but hey it works....so I had my usual regular yellow mustard, ketchup, caramelized onions, cole slaw and apple wood bacon....yum and deelish...the price was great $5 and enjoyed a glass of cidar beer...for a laid back atmosphere and a dj spinning real vinyl records this is a cool spot and kid friendly because what kid doesn't like hot dogs....I don't want to forget our waiter Dave M, he was great....so I say check em out....I think you'll be a Happy customer at Happy Dog."}
{"text":"I don't live in Cleveland anymore, but whenever I go back, my friends know that I will be dragging them here. Located in a great neighborhood, this place is very casual and laid-back. Live music brings about a nice touch as well.I love that they have a vegetarian hot dog option and its absolutely delicious. Their sauces are absolutely delicious and the tater tots are pretty spot on as well! If you get the hot dog with the works (chili etc.) it can be very filing. Unconventional topping options, but they have so many of them that you can try a different one each time. However, you may have a fairly decent wait if you come in during popular hours, but I would recommend!"}
{"text":"Creative amazing hot dogs! I love how you can get them at the Indians game! I always put Froot Loops on mine!"}
{"text":"We love this place!  Fun tasty hotdog choices, great beers, and tater tots with dipping sauces-whats not to like!  Our friends from Buffalo always denand this for lunch when they visit."}
{"text":"We visited based on other Yelper's reviews and we weren't disappointed. They have an awesome selection of beer and the dogs are great.   I got the veggie dog (with dark mustard, Spanish onions, Sriracha, pickle relish and garlicky escarole). Don't dismiss this one simply 'cuz it's veggie. It is truly the best I've ever had - - perfectly seasoned and cooked crispy. On the recommendation of our friendly bartender, my hubby ordered \"The Joey\" (peanut butter, Spanish onions, bacon and one other topping; he added Sriracha which made it \"The Spicy Joey\"). He loved it, but after tasting the veggie dog decided to get one of those for his second round. We also got fries with a couple of mustard-based dipping sauces. Nothing remarkable there, just fun, which is the point at the Happy Dog.   If you're in to fine dining, obviously this isn't the place for you. It is old, and funky; a \"joint\" in the truest sense. Our kind of place for sure. The only negative, which is too often the case at \"joints\", the bathrooms could use a serious hosing (makes one wonder about the cleanliness of the kitchen, but that's a subject for another day).  All in all, a must visit when in Cleveland. We'll definitely return if/when we go back!  Man, I could go for one of those veggie dogs right now - mmmm!"}
{"text":"I ordered one of happy dogs specials featured on their menu and everything seemed great until I realised the hotdog was not the veggie one I asked for :("}
{"text":"An egg on a hot dog, and some tots with amazing dippin sauces, make me one very, very, happy girl."}
{"text":"What's not to like :-)  The have great hot dogs with lots of great toppings!...Choices, Choices and more choices.   Their Tater Tots Rock. I can't decide on a favorite dip. I haven't tried them all...Yet.  What's better than a hot dog with a Left Hand Milk Stout on a cold day... Getting hungry right now thinking about it."}
{"text":"Went here with my wife who is a vegetarian with vegan tendencies. We both loved the food and the beer selection was great! We went on a Sunday at 4pm and surprisingly there was a good amount of people. Very casual atmosphere and for those with little ones, don't hesitate it's kid friendly (at least during the day it is). Don't let the outside scare you away. We will be going back."}
{"text":"Good dogs. High quality and a really fun experience. Could push it over the top by being a little more generous with some of the toppings, but I can't begrudge them that. Great idea. Good food. Fun times."}
{"text":"Cheap & delicious hot dogs, with a ton of topping options to choose from at no extra cost! Will definitely be returning for more!"}
{"text":"Love Happy Dog. Great food at really reasonable prices. One of my favorite places in Cleveland."}
{"text":"If you are visiting Cleveland and want to know what's up - do not miss the Happy Dog.      I never thought so many things would taste good on a hot dog. The dog is really more of a base and the toppings are what you want to focus on while combining the flavors.  And it's still only $5, which is awesome."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I love the food and the music at Happy Dog. I do think it's a great Cleveland institution. The tots are delicious and the beer selection is good, and you can't beat the price. But my god, the service is horrendous and it seems like it's getting worse. They are always under-staffed, it seems, and while that is not the fault of the servers and bartenders, it really takes away from what should be a great experience.  The first couple times I came here I got average service, quick enough, not much friendliness, but at least I received food and drink. I've come on Dyngus Day and for a couple music performances, and obviously those are busy times but I've always managed to get a drink or two.  However, I'm not sure when I will visit again after my last experience. My boyfriend's brother was visiting from DC on a Thursday evening and he had never been to Cleveland. We only had a couple hours to show him a real \"Cleveland\" place and thought Happy Dog would be perfect. We got in and it was kind of busy but we managed to find seats at the bar. We literally sat/stood there for 15 minutes trying to get ANYONE'S attention while they ignored our existence. The bartender would literally walk right past us and not even look in our direction. The waitress couldn't have cared less that we were there. We ended up walking out. How long am I supposed to wait for someone to acknowledge me? It was honestly ridiculous and did not represent Cleveland well."}
{"text":"Great ordering system, great atmosphere. Great excuse to eat tater tots as an adult.   I love the variety and amount of topping options here, and the sauce selection is superior to any other place I've visited.   Every time I come to the Cleveland area to visit family I make it a point to come out and eat. Purely awesome. Can't wait to try a vegan dog."}
{"text":"Hot dogs, Fries, and Tots....and a boatload of unlimited of toppings!  That's all you will find here, and that is all you  need.  The inside of this place looks like what it is, an old neighborhood bar that has not undergone cosmetic updates since the 50s.  The place seems to attract a mixed crowd of younger hipsters as well as familes with children.  The food menu is similar to a sushi menu.  At the tables, there are paper menus and pencils.  You have 2 entree choices to start with, consisting of either a 1/4 lb beef hot dog, or a Vegan Field Roast Italian Sausage.  From there, you have your choice of unlimited toppings, everything from hot sauce, vegan chilli, peanut butter, raspberry crunch mustard, etc, as well as the old standards such as ballpark mustard, ketchup, onions, etc.  Each dog with unlimited toppings is only $5, and is enough to fill most people up.  They also serve either french fries or tator tots for $2.50, again with as many unlimited dipping sauces as you would like.  Both times I have gone, my wife and I both ordered the Vegan hot dog option.  AMAZING!  We even convinced my father-in-law, who is a meat eater, to order the vegan hot dog, and he said that he will never order a regular hot dog here again because it was so good!  I ordered my dog with Vegan Chilli, stadium mustard, ketchup, onions, alien relish, and vodka kraut.  My wife ordered one of the suggested combinations off of their list of recommended dogs.  Apparently this hotdog was featured on \"The Best Thing I Ever Ate\" as Chef Michael Simon's favorite dog.  It was topped with Siriracha hot sauce, alien relish, and crunchy peanut butter.  It sounded disgusting, but was actually very good.  It had a little thai peanut spice thing going on.  The fries and tots were equally as good, and we enjoyed sampling a wide variety of the sauces.  I got my fries topped with vegan chili, which made for nice change of pace.    Overall, you can get a good, filling meal of a custom hot dog and a side of fries or tots for $7.50.  I was happy to find yet another local hangout that has unique and fun vegan options, and at a price you can't beat.  We will definately be back,,,,very soon!"}
{"text":"First time in here since the management changed over. Neat. Tater tots and beers."}
{"text":"I cant find what the hype is about??  The hot dog was good! Yes i give it that, great selection of toppings. But thats about it. Tater Tots and fries.....ehhh...nothing special about them. My drink was extremely watered down.    Bartender didnt want to give me the time of the day. It was is if i didnt exist.   The neighborhood, not the best. Usually i dont discriminate on neighborhood, but when you are eating and you see a thug walk past the window and fake shoot people with a pistol....well lets just say I wont be bringing my kids here or patronizing this place after dark."}
{"text":"Pretty conflicted after going once. The food was great, but the service was terrible. My wife ordered a Long Island iced tea, and after it was poorly made, she requested another one be made. After this, we barely got any service. I really enjoyed the dog with lots of options for toppings though. Hopefully the poor service was a fluke."}
{"text":"Thursday burgers. Everyday Hot Dogs. Wonderful beers. Wonderful staff. Innovative programming. Pinball.  Cash giveaways. Oprah tapings. Rare stamp purchases. Gold valuations. Exotic car museum. Back massages. Front massages.   One of these paragraphs is 100% true."}
{"text":"Not a great idea to order a hotdog after you've put away a few beers. I got a bit too adventurous with my condiments...but still a decent place to have a beer and some grub. Next time I'll keep my toppings classic."}
{"text":"As a non-Cleveland native, I am wary of any place Clevelanders rave about. My brother being one, insisted he and I head to the Happy Dog for dinner.  He was right about one thing immediately: it is my kind of place. The music is awesome, the clientele come from different walks of life, and the decor is a mix between punk and kitschy.  I will say straight up, I did not buy drinks here. I was not feeling up to it. So Ic an't comment on the bar side of the restaurant. HOWEVER.  Ever wanted to eat a hot dog and not feel bad about it afterward? I doubt I'm the only one who feels a little depressed when I think \"I just had a hot dog. For my meal. Ugh.\" Well this place knows what is up.  Five bucks for a 1/3rd lb all beef dog and any number of toppings.  What do they have for toppings that would make this dog worth $5? How about a fried egg, bacon, five different kinds of cheeses, five different kinds of \"Sauces,\" alien relish, a whole list of veggies, and a bunch of other stuff I can't recall because the menu was all toppings. This kind of \"make your own\" food is always interesting to me, and they did not disappoint.  The hot dog by itself tastes great, the fries and tots are great with the wasabi aoli dipping sauce, the toppings are all prepared excellently, and I spent $7.50 before tip on a \"hot dog\" dinner I was unashamed of."}
{"text":"My God,  make sure you put a fried egg on it.  Will be back soon.  The chorizo chile, the dog, the bar... All good."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite venues on the west side- lots of great local and touring bands, solid drink selection, and vegan-friendly novelty foods all in a really unique, vintage space.    If you plan accordingly, you can pretty much always get what you want in terms of the crowd/environment since they host such a wide variety of shows and activities; in addition to live music, they host trivia night, physics discussions, and a polka DJ.  The majority of these events don't start until later in the evening, so if you're just looking to nom on a dog in peace, they open at 4 Monday-Thursday and even earlier on the weekend.  I'm not sure if the Underdog is open again, but I sure hope so; the additional basement bar space was both much needed and also offered a different atmosphere.    I've been frequenting the Happy Dog for about two years now, and I have only one complaint- I wish so badly that they'd start using the Field Roast vegan frankfurters instead of the vegan Italian sausage.  The sausage just has too strong of a flavor, and you can't enjoy the toppings as much.  Love the tots :D."}
{"text":"Loved the tater tots with bacon and the hot dog. Pretty great place."}
{"text":"Hipster bar with hot dogs and tater tots. The huge list of toppings and dipping sauces makes it a lot of fun to plan out your order, and for the most part the food does not disappoint. The dogs are huge, and they have veggie dogs too. The beer list is as long as the toppings list, with dozens of good beers on tap.    Basically, if you like dive-bar atmosphere and gourmet hot dogs, you'll love Happy Dog."}
{"text":"Seriously, this place is so good.   The food? So good.  The bar? So good.  The service? So good.  The vibe? So, so good.  The music? The community involvement? The special events (trivia night! science night!)? So, so, so good.   Happy Dog is that perfect mix of neighborhood standby, dive bar, trendy hot spot and casual hang out."}
{"text":"This place Cleveland landmark for a reason.  Awesome draft beer selection, $5 flat price for a hot dog/ vegan dog with unlimited toppings, and tater tots/ fries are also flat price w/ unlimited dips.  PLUS events such as polka happy hour (what??  yes.), science talks, live music, and more.  There's also a downstairs area, called the Underdog.  They get super busy especially during happy hour, so expect to wait a little while to place your order & get food.  Also, on weekend nights (and sometimes on Thursdays) they may have live music and charge a cover, usually after 9pm.  If you're in before that it's fine."}
{"text":"Our family thoroughly enjoyed our Happy Dog experience.  Good beer choices, good dogs, quick service.  Worth a few trips to experiment with the multitude of topping choices."}
{"text":"I was initially impressed by the amount and variety of toppings available (from pimento mac n cheese to Caribbean coleslaw). If you wanted, you could get a hot dog with everything, but that would be an unfortunate mistake. After a few experiments, the old adage, \"less is more,\" truly shines as finding a harmonious combination of 3-4 toppings far exceeds the flavor profile of 6-7 chaotically mashed together. I mean, spaghetti O's are great, but doesn't really mesh well with froot loops. That being said, it's an excellent value proposition for 5 bucks. Tater tots are standard fare, but can come to life with some interesting dips (Momocho's habanero sauce stands out) and toppings. Fun place to just have a cheap and chill night out with friends."}
{"text":"Good customizable hot dogs, different sausage options, lots of topping choices and several nice sauces. Worth a visit. Nice beer selection. Reasonable service. Fun neighborhood."}
{"text":"Happy Dog is a real game changer for the \"bar dog\".... it's the standard! Happy Dog is absolutely my favorite bar in Cleveland and they serve up the best hot dogs ever!    Now I have to say...I'm more of a burger and fries person. I had a lot of bad hot dogs experiences so before Happy Dog, if I had to choose between burger or dog, I was always going with the burger. Not. Any. More. Happy Dog has shown me that not all hot dogs are created equal and I can be the master of that creation.  I love that you can go into the bar and design your dog with unlimited toppings for FREE! How awesome is that? They even have a half-off happy hour.   My favorite creation so far with the dog topped with beans cheddar cheese, fried egg, onions, and pickles. I also get the tots with 5 different dipping sauces (sorry I can't remember the names).   You have to try it. It's always a great time!"}
{"text":"I wanted to love Happy Dog because I heard it was so vegan friendly. I went with my parents and we all ordered the Field Roast vegan dog with various toppings and a couple orders of fries and tots. The place wasn't that crowded, yet our food took about 25 minutes. I bit into my \"vegan\" dog to discover it was meat! They didn't seem apologetic at all, and it took awhile to replace it with a vegan dog, with some toppings missing. All in all, the food was actually delicious once they got it right, but one star off for lack of attention and another for slow service and apathy."}
{"text":"Amazing spot. Dog and tots were perfect. Great beer selection, too. Staff was great as well. Been here multiple times and it's always a 5 star experience."}
{"text":"This place was a pleasant surprise today! My fiancé and I had just got out of the Indians game (we won of course) and we were looking for a cool little joint to get some food. My buddy said check out Happy Dog. My first reaction was, \"Wow, that sounds like a Vietnamese restaurant!\". But, I love creative little niche places like this.   I've been to Dirty Frank's in the Columbus area and while this is a similar restaurant please don't be fooled. Happy Dog is waaaaaaay better than Frank's and honestly, I think it's cheaper. The pricing is unbelievably fair, I honestly felt like I was taking advantage in the end. Customize your dog, add whatever you want or even all of the toppings (which I think was well over 20) and no matter what is 6 bucks.   Next time I'm in Cleveland, trust me, I'LL BE BACK!"}
{"text":"The Happy Dog is like any other! Always a good time and how could you say No to a quarter pound dog with your choice of 50+ toppings. I bring my friends here when they come in town and they are never disappointed and neither will you be!"}
{"text":"DJ is laying down some funk fo the seriously light hearted old schoolers 2 nite.    Yep yep!"}
{"text":"What can i say that hasn't already been said. its amazing. go here. don't be put off by the dive bar atmosphere. i love that i can go in here during the day and see families eating with their kids and at night its an entirely different crowd. I'm not such a fan of their veggie dog, it taste very strongly of fennel which is a flavor i don't personally like, but many other people i know say its their favorite so i will not begrudge happy dog a star for that. great people watching, big beer list, great food! it can be overwhelming to pick out what you want, but they always have a \"suggestive wieners\" list if you're feeling stumped. don't miss this cleveland institution."}
{"text":"A bit dingy on the inside, but looks can be deceiving. Overall our experience here was awesome. Drink were great and strong (not complaining). Enjoyed their Moscow mule with ginger beer and vodka, why not right! We also tried Michael Simons fab on Best Thing I Ever Ate, pleasant surprise with the pickled relish which paired famously with the nutty peanut butter and salty hot dog. I would definitely recommend. We also ordered a veggie dog with pimento Mac n cheese, Brazilian chimichurri, and onions - it was delicious, I wanted a second! We also ordered tots with an assortment of dipping sauces- lived their house ketchup and the Jamaican mustard mojo. Aside from how run down the place is and how pricy some drinks are, we really enjoyed the food and great service! Hope to come back soon with friends!"}
{"text":"My friend gave the best description of Happy Dog I have heard yet:  You're sober and you want to get drunk?  Go to Happy Dog! You're drunk and you want to sober up?  Go to Happy Dog!  Their INSANE hot dogs are a great way to start or end you're night.  Always delicious!  Always cheap!  I love their Scantron / Sushi Checklist ordering process.  I also love that no matter what I'm wearing, I'll fit in at Happy Dog.  Brooks Brothers shirt and khakis?  I'm being \"ironic.\"  Hoodie and jeans?  I look like the bartenders.  You're ALWAYS dressed appropriately to go to Happy Dog :)  Happy Dog really is the ULTIMATE hipster place.  Last time I was there, I had an extensive beard management discussion with the bartender...  This is that kind of place."}
{"text":"The basics: Hotdogs with toppings galore, tots, fries, and beer.   I went here with a group of friends for a late lunch. We all got hot dogs from the \"Suggestive Weiners\" menu. I had the '2am' with a side of tots and some beer. Great selection of craft beers and beers on tap. Chill staff.  Obviously you won't be going here if you're on a diet.   Eat here."}
{"text":"I've only been to the Happy Dog once, but I would definitely go again. I went with some friends on a Monday night and the place was pretty quiet, but not dead. Made for a good atmosphere. We were able to commandeer a few tables for our large group, which doesn't often happen in restaurants.  Love the old-school video games! I wasn't expecting that and it was such a fun surprise...even though I still suck just as badly as I did when I was a kid.  I love the fact that i can basically put whatever I want on a hot dog. I ended up with a veggie sausage with spinach, onions, and a few different condiments...it was amazing! Normally I'm just a ketchup and mustard kinda gal, but this exceeded my expectations. The fries were also amazing and I was excited to see a variety of dipping sauces.  I recall there being quite a good beer selection and don't think it was that expensive, but honestly, I didn't pay so I don't remember.   I was a bit put-off by the hipster-scene, as it's not really my thing, but I got over it quick. I had a great time and I think this is definitely a place in Cleveland you should check out!"}
{"text":"They have a great choice of toppings and are really good at what they do. I was a little upset when I went there recently and found out they had updated their menu and somethings got taken off but I am pretty happy with the overall service and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Cheap beer in a ton of hot dogs I guess you can go wrong with the combination but be ready to hang out with a bunch of hipsters... I like the place cuz I was driving by and I was hungry and decided to pull in and give it a shot overall it's an OK place, would I go back perhaps but will I highly recommend it probably not.. but then of course I'm not into being a hipster myself so that makes a big difference; being more of a clean-cut guy, i might decide to go back if I was in the mood for some cheap PBR and a good dog!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  Can't go wrong with spaghetti o's as a topping. Fun for kids too!"}
{"text":"After living in Athens, Ohio, for 6 years I had grown accustomed to dressed up hotdogs from O'Betty's Red Hots. While those dogs from my college days will always hold a special place in my heart, Happy Dog really sets the bar in terms of options. The list of toppings is pretty huge, and sauce lovers will be in heaven for sure. You can get as many, or as few, toppings as you please and creating your dream dog is as simple as checking off anything appealing. The tater tots are top notch too.  Stop in for food, drink, and hopefully catch some live music.  Happy Dog is a fun and filling Cleveland joint. Check it out."}
{"text":"Love the happy dog! Fun place to take friends from out of town, or to just go for a quick bite to eat when you feel like treating your body bad with junk food! all the different sauces for the tots or fries! AMAZING"}
{"text":"Put some peanut butter on my hot dog and I'm a happy man!!!"}
{"text":"Right off the bat - when someone gives you the ol \"Happy Dog has the best hot dogs ever!\", it is a coded way of saying \"I love make-your-own-salads they're so fun!\"  That's basically what people like about it - the 50-some topping options.  The hot dogs themselves are a cheap, tasteless, bottom of the barrel canvas, and the bun is even worse.  The food quality hints at twice-a-week GFS runs.  Beer selection is relatively average.  The atmosphere isn't bad.  They used to have good live shows here, but I haven't had a reason to go here in the last couple of years."}
{"text":"I was in Cleveland visiting.  My friends took me and my toddler out for hot dogs.  The dogs were good.  And having the ability to customize your hot dog how you like it is great.  My issues are that there isn't a kid's sized hot dog.  I wasted $6 because what little kid eats a giant hot dog?  Not mine! While Happy Dog has a bar atmosphere, there were 5-6 other kids there at the same time we were.  It would be terrific if there was a smaller sized hot dog for kids. The other thing that bothered me was that when I asked them to turn off Planet of the Apes and put on something more kid friendly, the choice of the stoner behind the bar was Lord of the Rings. Come on man.  The guy that took our order was nice, professional, and articulate; while the other workers seemed like ninnies. Too bad he lift in the middle of our meal."}
{"text":"happy dog has changed a bit since i used to jaunt over for some music and beers.  the change ain't bad, either.  my love of the tater tot has no bounds. well, it does.  being a broke ass student means bags of tater tots spanning several meals across several days.  booo.  but happy dog tots?  those are a different story.  they make tots fancy.  napolean dynamite would take the happy dog's tots, shove 'em in his pockets, and then have a jacket side pocket for the myriad of dipping sauces they now offer.  ah, the happy dog.  so many hipsters.  so many dipping sauces. ...for the tots.  not for the hipsters.  between myself and my partner in crime, we split about 11 of those side sauces.  here's the deal:  you can order as many as you want.  you don't have to pay extra.  and you want to try them.  they're as diverse as a sf muni ride in the middle of tourist season.  ...and non-tourist season.  of the handful of choices we picked, my favorites were:  the saffron aioli, the garlic-tomato-basil jam, and the thai chile and garlic sauce.  i mean, c'mon.  a place that can class-up tater tots is an a-ok place by me.  take in a few beers, dance to some music, laugh with some new friends you meet over tots.  you'll probably see alexis and i there then next time you venture in.  'cuz if i'm in town, i'll be here at least once."}
{"text":"Happy Dog is a dream in tube form. The bartenders look like the love children of Jack White and Dave Grohl and the bar looks like a first year art student rented out a VFW.  The walls are dressed in framed posters and wood paneling that's one step up in durability from cardboard and one step lateral in appearance. It's like Happy Dog stopped moving with the earth's axis after The Fumble and remained too scared of what Cleveland sports might bring in the 90s and aughts to move forward. I wish I would've followed their lead on that one.   Get at least two hot dogs here: One you create and one from the suggested list. I'd go with the Chef's choice: Louisiana remoulade, bacon spiked southern greens, smoked gouda, and a fried egg that was both crispy and runny. The bacon greens give it a nice, almost potato-chip like crunch and the poppyseed bun holds up well enough considering it looks like the Octomom's pregnant stomach trying to hold everything in. (And If you've never been treated to that visual paradise, be thankful or Google image search \"Octomom pregnant stomach.\")  The dog itself has a slight reddish tinge to it and juices of sodium and fat rush out and cascade down the meat when your teeth cut through the casing. My unsophisticated palate couldn't really find the gouda but my stop at Happy Dog did find something I haven't been able to find in NYC or Philly: The best hot dog I've ever had.   Cherish this place, Cleveland."}
{"text":"GREAT Food!  Drinks are a bit pricey and it's gotten a little too \"hip\" lately.   Tots are amazing and worth it though!  Love all the dipping sauces available with them for FREE!  The only complaint is they do live music upstairs all the time when they do have a venue for it downstairs.  It's too loud in there.  Plus the do some weird thing on Tuesday nights with classical music and expect people in the bar to BE QUIET for the music.   No thanks, I like to talk in a bar and chomp my tots!"}
{"text":"Insanely awesome.  some of the toppings aren't as great, but choose different ones next time, you wont run out any time soon.  Awesome selection of beer, tots rock, and if I had to complain, the hot dogs are too big.  They should offer normal sizers in addition to the half pounders so I could try more of the awesomeness that is their toppings.  PS the chimichurri is the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Absolutely no complaints.  You get what you pay for, then some.  I've always had really solid service.  Completely happy dogger here!"}
{"text":"This review is after two visits. My experience was good both times. Food is good. The various combinations of toppings means you can always try out things or stick to your favs....whatever suits your style. Personally I liked their fries better than the tots.  Again, the variety of dipping sauces keeps every bite interesting. They do have a very good selection of beer on tap. We have had good service both the times. The bat area was crazy busy.... I can see how easily the bartender can accidentally ignore you in the crowd. I don't care about the live music as much in this place.  It is a very small place and the speakers blaring in you ear does get annoying.  Luckily the first time we went we were early and got done when the band was just setting up. This time we were in the basement so we could not hear the loud music. My concern: the basement. It is low ceiling basement, dimly lit. I did not see any sprinkler system. And the only exit is through the narrow stairs that lead upstairs to the main restaurant. In case of a fire you are doomed if you are in their basement. Its very dimly lit....so u can't see how clean your table is. The parking is also very limited. No dedicated lot. Basically an average place in terms of food and service.  But comes with a potential of a death trap if u happen to be in the basement and there is a fire. If I go next time, its gonna be upstairs or I m walking out."}
{"text":"The hot dog was delicious, I had 22 toppings.  The service was terrible, my wife's hotdog came missing a couple of ingredients.  The order was remade incorrectly - we all finished before they said she needed to reorder. She will finish at least 30 minutes after the rest of us- boo!  Update - they comped the meal to make up for the poor experience, glad they took positive action to address this - thanks!"}
{"text":"This review was dangerously close to being a two...I mean I had a full paragraph written, but had to leave my review as a draft to come back and finish it. I was initially unimpressed with the service since I was basically ignored for the first ten minutes while 5 bartenders pretended to look very busy. I told several friends about this experience, and read others reviews before deciding to return and actually eat this time...I'm really glad I did.   We were automatically greeted by a bartender who welcomed us back. Followed up with the most generous pour on a glass of Merlot ever...I mean more than I fill up at home. You know from all the previous reviews about the menu and the ordering process, so all I will say is that the Vegan dog is simply amazing. It's not that I'm Vegan, I just try to cut fat and eat relatively healthy, so many times I leave less than satisfied with my choices, but full nonetheless. Not the case this time. I would have eaten and enjoyed that vegan dog even if it had not been smothered by toppings. The great service continued on as the spot got busier on a Saturday night. More bartenders came in and they constantly walked around the bar and checked back in.   Only tip I'll give is to get in before 8ish if you're going on a Saturday night. Both times we were there a live band was playing and a cover of $5 went into effect. Dude, that's as much as a dog!"}
{"text":"I. love. hot. dogs. period.   I was surprised that I lived in Cleveland for as long as I had before even hearing about this place, then it took even longer for me to get here! Crazy!   Everything you've heard about the tots is true. They are fabulously crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and they made me forget about fries even being an option here. The truffle honey mustard was my favorite sauce the first time I came, but the second time it tasted less like honey mustard with truffle and more like straight horseradish...weird. I don't know what was happening. It was still good, but not what I remembered or expected.   Now, the dogs. I am a horrific decision maker. Seriously. So, this list of toppings is, in one way, superb, but in a much larger way, a huge problem for me. I want everything! And I know it won't taste good, so my first dog was a simple one and a variation on a suggested Chicago dog. It was delicious!! Love those sport peppers! My second hot dog was in a whole different world of good. It was another \"suggestive weiner\" with Brie and pineapples and other good stuff. I seriously can't stop thinking about the perfection of that hot dog!!   The beer selection here is great! I also have trouble making that decision...  As far as service goes, I've discovered that it really depends. My first visit was pleasant and utterly unremarkable in a good way. The second definitely fell into a 2 or 3 star service experience, but I don't expect perfection in a place that's organized in a way that doesn't really promote great organization/efficiency and especially when they're bustling ALWAYS. But, I also get the feeling that this way works for them and they're not going to try to fix something that isn't entirely broken.   Alas, worth noting:  1. We got another table's dog, we returned it, then our server brought it back and REALLY tried to convince me it was mine. I clearly spotted nacho cheese, not Brie. I don't think she fully believed me until a neighboring table discovered we were discussing their hot dog.  2. Our server made a seriously disgruntled sound, face, and rolled her eyes when I asked for another drink before the table service for the night ended. 3. Our server also seemed to be incredibly frustrated when we wanted to order more tots and another hot dog after our initial order. Hey! We were hungry and this is an eating establishment, right? Let us get our fill, please!   Anyways, despite some hiccups, it was well worth it and it obviously didn't change my rating!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Happy Dog. Their menu is easy to order from & their specialty sauces are amazing. The food comes out really quickly. The drinks are decently priced & the guys behind the bar have always been nice to me. There is always a live band playing & it's always good entertainment. The food portions are an excellent size for the amount of money you pay for them which is not a lot. There are a lot of different options for their menu, also."}
{"text":"Hot diggity dog this place is good.   I have to confess, when we pulled up I thought I was at the wrong place. I totally was not expecting a bar. For some reason I had a black and white diner vision in my head. Anyways...  The menu is fun and there's like a trillion combinations you can choose from.  My combination: I went with the beef dog, kraut, nacho cheese, mustard, ketchup, and pickles (I love condiments!)   The tots are a must (golden & crispy)."}
{"text":"Guess I'm just not a huge gourmet hot dog fan.  Don't get me wrong, the meal was good, and it was fun to order and try their millions of dipping sauces, but just not sure I'm running back here anytime soon.  Dogs are $5 each with no limit to the type and quantity of toppings applied.  they have some \"pre-designed\" selections (like the 1:45am and Chef's Special) that we tried...others at the table made up their own concoctions.  They also have some killer tater tots, but we warned...their serving size is HUGE and could easily be shared by two people (we took a bunch home).  They also offer just about any kind of dipping sauce you want (at no extra cost!).  Some of them were pretty good (like the honey mustard), and others were just meh (like the homemade ketchup).  Overall a fun place to go for some wacky food choices, but as i said before not someplace I'll be frequenting regularly."}
{"text":"Such a great environment and friendly staff! Started off with the fries to split between two people and even that was a lot of food. For only having hot dogs, fries, and tots on the menu the options are limitless. Portions are a good size and the price is even better. All around a wonderful place that I'm sure to visit often!"}
{"text":"They have FIFTY different hot dog toppings , regular and vegan hot dogs and tatter tots with about a dozen toppings and dips.  I'm here on the first Wednesday of the month to watch \"Keep Talking,\" a cool new $5 show in the basement."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's really chill, all of the people who work there are really nice, and I love that it's vegetarian friendly. Good for sitting in, or calling ahead to pickup."}
{"text":"This place is so much fun! Their hot dogs and their fixin's are awesome!!! Trivia night on Monday's are great! Their vegie dog is super yummy!"}
{"text":"Happy Dog is my jam. We go most times that we are in Cleveland and we enjoy it every time.  Pros:  *Straightforward pricing. You don't end up with a $10 hot dog because you add lots of stuff that you can't keep track of that's all different prices. It's a flat price for a hot dog and you can get allllll kinds of toppings.  *Easy menu to navigate. It's a checklist and you just check off what you want.  *Delicious hot dogs. Their toppings are also well-seasoned and taste good.  *You can get lots of toppings on your tater tots or fries and the pricing there is also straightforward.  *Full bar, baby! And a cool bar, to boot. Most of the room is a long, oval bar. It's got a naturally-retro vibe (that sort of ageless, classic bar thing where you know it probably hasn't changed much since your parents sat at a similar bar) and I even heart the sign out front.  The only things that could use any improvement are some of the menu descriptions. I don't know what \"alien\" relish is and I don't really want to ask what every single thing is that has a creative name. Having a menu-menu with descriptions scattered around the bar in addition to the checklists would be awesome. That's not most of the items, though--most things are things you can recognize and are delicious. I especially like getting the chorizo chili on anything. (Chili cheese tots yeaaaaaaah!)  Everyone is also really friendly when we go. We've never had bad service and it's lovely."}
{"text":"The HD is a cool place, I've been a handful of times and I've always enjoyed my food. The waiters/ waitresses have always been Friendly and attentive but I seen nothing but rude and unattentive bartenders which is a bummer. The hot dogs are good but my only complaint is they serve the huge poppy seed bun cold?? I like my buns toasted, oh and every time the bun splits in half which and all toppings fall out is annoying. $5 for a hot dog is alittle pricey, but its a bar so...  There is a great selection of toppings for your dog and tots which is def a bonus, oh and if you are a guy trying to pick up chicks, this place is always packed with um ha!"}
{"text":"I love the ability to customize all aspects of your meal. You have so many options to make your perfect hot dog, or go a little crazy with a peanut butter and fruit loop hot dog (Check out Michael Symon's favorite - chunky peanut butter, siracha, alien relish). Not to mention all the sauces you can get, unlimited choices! I believe it's about 50 options of homemade toppings (again, unlimited!) The cost is completely reasonable. $6 for hot dog with your choice of toppings and sauces. $3 for tater tots with unlimited sauces and then additional toppings like cheese sauce and chili for additional $1. Great beer selection as well! Plenty of micro brews. I HIGHLY recommend the chimichurri sauce for the tater tots... My favorite!! Also, the service was great!"}
{"text":"So good ! Where else can you basically create the hot dog of your dreams -- with over a jillion of options . I had the dog ( minus the bun) with slaw, bacon, cheese, hot peppers, and some incredible sauces. Ditto the same for the tots we had- we smothered then in cheese, chili, and drenched them with sauces on the side. My son managed to create  the tots of his dreams- with bacon and mac and cheese. Super yummy. The prices are so reasonable- 6 dollars and 4 dollars for the hot dog and tots. The beer selection was great and I was happy to have a gluten free beer- yummy. Overall, we love and will be back often ."}
{"text":"Cleveland was an interesting part of my road trip and Yelp reviews gave me strong urges to try Happy Dog. How can all these reviews be wrong? Hint: They are right!  Happy Dog is basically a big bar with a lot of people because it's hugely popular for obvious reasons - beer and hot dogs. The beer selection is golden, so many microbrews on tap to enjoy. The hot dog is a unique experience.  I would not say the hot dog itself was particularly memorable. I would only say that the crazy topping possibilities makes it unique and fun. The tater tots are no joke, they are amazing.  Happy Dog is a relaxing place, you will have a good time here. Have a game plan for the hot dog toppings or you'll be sitting for hours figuring out what is a good combination."}
{"text":"Vegetarian hot dog!!   I was a little skeptical about the whole thing when I heard about this highly recommended place in the west side so never visited. Finally for a friend's birthday party, I had to go there. I am glad that I did. This place is very nice. The parking is across the street and there is plenty of parking on the street after business hours. The ambiance if of a typical old time bar.   I ordered tater tots and honestly I did not like it that much. I am not a big fan of deep fried potato snacks. The sauces were nice overall I enjoyed it. I will order their french fries next time. The main dish, vegetarian hot dog with suggested 6 toppings combo was what made me a fan of this place. I have always wanted to try hot dogs since I came to USA. This was my first good vegetarian hot dog. Actually it was very good.   It is my highly recommended place for friends to hang out with cheap food and drinks , where you can make a lot of noise."}
{"text":"This place is super.  I was only in Cleveland for 48 hours and I could have stayed here the entire time.  Great Vibe, Cool folks and fantastic beer and food selections."}
{"text":"Visited here on a trip to Cleveland, based on a referral as a spot with vegan options. Ordered a field roast veggie dog and got served a real hot dog instead. First time tasting meat in over 20 years... Spent the remainder of my day vomiting thanks to the careless kitchen staff. Fuck this restaurant. Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"We LOVED eating here! Great options for both vegetarians and meat-eaters. We will definitely be back soon. I'm still craving the Tater Tots."}
{"text":"Ok ok so I know I just went here, but I couldn't stay away!! This time got the fries without cheese (gasp I know!) but I wanted to get to enjoy the sauces to the fullest. As far as sauces we got wasabi aioli (odd color, but tasted great), balsamic bacon marmalade (not a marmalade consistency, but holy amazeballs so good!), Brazilian chimichurri (also amazing!). And I had to return to my fave chipotle hollandaise! On my dog this time, everything bagel cream cheese (which tasted EXACTLY like an everything bagel!) buffalo wing sauce and a pickle! So good!!  Once again a stellar experience, thanks Happy Dog!!!!!"}
{"text":"For those who dare (or in my case as it were, for those who are drunk)... try the following combination:  Veggie dog (or non-veggie - whatever floats your boat here) Egg Cheese Peanut Butter Whatever Jam they have at that point Fruit loops Ketchup (not necessary, but I need ketchup with my eggs)  I call it the drunk breakfast dog - you get your sausage and eggs with some cheese and ketchup, Side of toast (the bun) with peanut butter and jam, and some cereal as well! Salty sweet fatty carby goodness (or at least that is what I am convinced it was)... :D"}
{"text":"Happy Dog makes Amy a happy camper. The bar is perfect in every way, except it is not within walking distance to my home. (In case you missed it, the laws of the universe state that everything must revolve around me). Besides that one downside, I can't think of any reason this bar shouldn't be on the top of your list. Live bands? Check! Gourmet hot dogs with 30 different topping options? Check! Tater Tots? (my personal fave) Check! Fries? Check!   Plus, they have a super retro décor including shellacked wood paneling, sweet vinyl stools, and a center, open bar so you get a great view to people watch."}
{"text":"I went to The Happy Dog to see the band Martini Five-O, a group whose genre is similar enough to my jazz foursome that I figured it would be worth exploring trying to get a gig there myself.  I didn't have any food there, but had a few beers and was impressed with the bottled beer selection.  They also seem to have quite a variety of spirits available for cocktails, but unfortunately there was no draught beer available.  Still, the 1950's diner design (complete with old linoleum and wooden booths, and a pretty nice bar seating area) won me over, and the wait staff and patrons were extremely friendly, and it was a great setting for watching a low-key jazz / surf-rock group."}
{"text":"$5 hotdogs with any number of topping combinations and plenty of beer choices, this is a hotdog lovers heaven.  If the hotdog combinations aren't enough to keep you choosing, grab an order of tater tots with a variety of toppings and as many dipping sauces as you want.  From sweet to spicy the each of the sauce flavors are unique.  My personal favorite is their top secret fry sauce for both my dog, tots, and fries.  The atmosphere is super casual and cozy, but with such a small space its not ideal for larger parties. Being such a popular spot parking can sometimes be troublesome, there is a designated parking lot but you may be better off finding a spot in on the street or in a public lot.  With each visit I try and pick a new topping to add or try. Each visit is a new taste surprise. So go on a get happy, Dog that is."}
{"text":"Well I'd give it 5 stars if it was a little more comfortable atmosphere here. Seems to be a LITTLE too much of a locals-only vibe. Still a good place to get a off-the-wall microbrew or weird hot dog or just for a change of pace but meh....."}
{"text":"So after reading all of the hype we went last night for dinner, we had great service and had a nice rapport with our bartender, we ordered and got out food in a timely manner and then it was like we evaporated into thin air!  We had to wave our arms for another beer and our empty plates sat in front of us so long that we got up and walked to another part of the bar....the service was AWFUL!  We consider ourselves to be very friendly and respectful and this was just blatantly bad.  We will never go back, and aside from the hot dogs being way too big the food and beer selection, as well as the place itself is really good.  I hope you have a better experience or at least a different waitress who isn't taking her bad day out on her patrons."}
{"text":"If you ever typed the phrase \"endless toppings on hotdog\" into Google, then this review (and restaurant) is for you. Happy Dog is apparently considered a Cleveland institution, and it shows! This place has a ton of character, and so does the food! Whatever your heart desires, you can put on a  meat/veggie hot dog. Wanna put an egg on a hot dog? You got it! They let 'em do it in pizza and burgers, so why not, right? Think sloppy joe chili is for burgers only? Think again! Food quality is pretty great and the beer selection isn't bad at all. The best part is that they have either a live band or some other event (when I went it was a storytelling session) entertaining you as you wolf down your loaded hot dog and tots. A fun stop if you're in Rock n Roll town for sure!"}
{"text":"Excellent Dogs.  Great Music. Good Beer Selection. Perfect place to hang with friends  'Nuff Said!"}
{"text":"This a cool, fun place to get a good beer and a big hot dog.  The toppings are obviously a huge bonus.  And the tater tots... hoh boy... so good, especially with a few choice dipping sauces.  I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"I hate to interrupt the love fest that is happening among Yelpers about Happy Dog, but here goes...the good, the bad, and the ugly.  The Good Cool list of unique toppings for the hot dog.  This is an inspired list ranging from house-made ketchup to chunky peanut butter to carmelized onions and the list goes on and on.  I think there are 50 toppings to choose from.  The tater tots were some of the best I've had.  The interior has the feeling of an old-school bowling alley bar.  The Bad I think the hot dogs roll around on a wienie roaster like you see at 7-11.  I wish they would grill them.  Given the low cost structure of this place, I wish they'd offer patrons a way to customize how they want their wiener prepared (boiled, grilled, etc).  The quality of the hot dog wasn't that good.  We've had better.  These are definitely NOT Vienna Beef hot dogs.  The Ugly The bathrooms were absolutely FILTHY.  Whenever I see a restaurant with filthy bathrooms it immediately raises a red flag to me and I was instantly repulsed.  The food here leaves an aftertaste in your mouth that screams, \"this food has been cooked in OLD GREASE.\"  We made a beeline from Happy Dog to Tremont Scoops to get the taste out of our mouths.  Sorry fellow Yelpers but you let me down on this one.  I won't go back."}
{"text":"For the price variety and quality presented here, its nearly impossible to find a better place anywhere.  The hot dogs are tubular, and the toppings are mindboggling. The bar is also one of the most well stocked that I've been to. Some beers get a little pricey *cough*ThreePhilosiphers*cough* but theres so many that it doesn't matter.  I haven't been there long enough to see how good the service really is, but seeing as I went there the night of the NBA finals and got checked to see if I was taken care of by about 4 people, I'll assume its good. Also, a li'l funfact is that a good number of bartenders there are in some excellent local bands, and the bar itself is host to plenty of great shows on a fairly regular basis for a really low cover.  The music choice is really wide with leanings toward folk and old country (so I hear), but the crowd is more of the Plaid n' PBR set. Say what you will about the crowd or how \"hipsters are taking over\" and what have you, the Happy Dog is just plain quality."}
{"text":"First, let me say that I am not a big fan of unhealthy food, and hot dogs definitely qualify. I went here to see a show. I knew there would be nothing good to eat, so I didn't go here hungry. I also wanted to see what the food was like, since I am trying to get some reviews under my belt.  The server was pleasant enough for a corner bar, if a tad disinterested. I asked if I could have my hot dog toppings on the side, and she told me they don't put things on the side. I didn't want to pay for a hot dog that would be covered in something I might not like so I opted for their house ketchup and mustard. I also got the tater tots and the fries, because I wanted to be thorough. I asked for them to be crispy. My date wanted to drink, so she ordered a vodka and tonic.  The food came out and I wasn't disappointed very much. In fact, I couldn't be, since I figured it would be a hot dog, some tater tots and fries. The tater tots and fries were not crispy, but I expected that from a disinterested waitress. The hot dog was a hot dog. I can't believe how people can get excited over a hot dog. It's a tube of disgusting \"meat\". Throwing peanut butter on it doesn't make it better.  The real disappointment was my date's drink, there was almost no alcohol in it. I mentioned it to the waitress and she basically shrugged. I ordered another one, and told her to make it a double on the alcohol. Again, there was almost no alcohol, but there was an added $2 to the price of the drink. What a rip-off!  Will I be back? Of course not. This place is a neighborhood bar with a lame gimmick and watered down drinks. The music was good, though."}
{"text":"The rave reviews are for a reason, folks!  At Happy Dog, you can do no wrong.  Grab yourself a craft beer or PBR, some tots and go to town on your (veggie) dog.    Some tips:  - Change things up!  If you find you weren't drooling AFTER the hot dog you just ate, try something different next time!   - Order at least 5 sauces with your tots.  The plates that the sauces are served on handle 5 perfectly - any less is a waste of tasting opportunity.   - After 9, expect a cover charge for the band that is playing.  On Sunday, when the Amazing Food Truck Race is on, expect all the TVs to be showing that and the speakers blasting for the local home team:  the Hodge Podge Truck.   - Most importantly, tip your waiter well!  All of the bartenders also serve as waitstaff and most of them are there all days of the week.  They pull tips and have a good memory of patrons, so pay it forward for the next time you visit.   Go, and go often!"}
{"text":"Why 5 stars? Because this is how hot dog eating should be.     ---   ---   ---  With fully customizable hot dogs with tons of niche toppings/condiments to choose from, every hot dog experience since Happy Dog has been ruined.   Some of my favorite toppers are as follows:  Spaghetti O's, \"Froot\" Loops, Mac-n-Cheese, Andy Capp's Hot Fries, Peanut Butter, and a sunny side up egg. There are 18 freaking sauces that you can choose from as a condiment, mostly consisting of ketchups, mustards, bbq sauces, etc.   I don't know how anyone could say that they don't like Happy Dog, unless you just don't like hot dogs in general."}
{"text":"Hot dogs, tater tots, and alcohol. What more could you ask for?  This place can get pretty loud when there's live music (obviously) but otherwise it's easy to have a conversation with friends.  I usually get the same dog - bacon, cucumbers, and a fried egg. The tater tots are great with the top secret fry sauce!  It's walking distance to Cleveland Public Theatre, the Capitol, XYZ, Sweet Moses, and some cute shops in Gordon Square."}
{"text":"I was visiting my girlfriend in Cleveland and we decided to grab lunch at Happy Dog. The hot dogs were great and I loved that you could put whatever toppings/sauces you wanted on them. There were so many delicious sounding toppings that I ordered a few too many and had to eat mine with a fork and knife, but I was entirely okay with that. If you eat here, you MUST get an order of tater tots, they are incredible."}
{"text":"Happy Dog is a weird, weird place. And I say that in the most flattering sense of the word. Located on the eastern end of Gordon Square, this bar/hot dog stop looks like your favorite neighborhood bar. Happy Dog boasts a solid selection of local brews and a surprising array of ways to make a hot dog a meal, accompanied by tater tots or fries with an impressive assortment of condiments for both.  Being from Chicago I can never pass up an opportunity to make a mess by ordering a Chicago Dog. Purists would object to the celery salt being optional but everything was there, and it was delicious. These are delicious, butcher shop quality dogs (there is a vegetarian option also), quality buns and a dizzying number of combinations for toppings. I also had fries with an aioli mayo...and a platform brew called \"Kishka\" that was also featured at the Dyngus day festival.  Events at Happy Dog are also weird in the good way. Music, sure. DJ, sometimes. Pop physics lecture? Regularly scheduled. There was a presentation on wind power for Cleveland the night we were there.   Happy Dog is community engaged, fun, but responsible. It's like a college bar that grew up and it's totally worth a visit.   www.happydogcleveland.com for the menu, schedule of events, beer list. You will have no regrets. Dedicated off street parking, too!"}
{"text":"When I came back to Cleveland, I was angry at myself for not having \"that place\" that I had to go to visit.  And then I remembered Happy Dog's tater tots, and I made sure that I stopped in one night and had myself a Jack and Ginger and tots with a couple of dipping sauces.  You can't go wrong with a places that prides itself on letting you mess up your own food with ordering a topping you might not like.  Everything is great.  (I have never enjoyed the acoustics for bands, though.)  One star off, though, for not perfecting a ketchup that, in my mind, rivals even the largest of competitors (which, in my mind, is not hard to beat.)  I'd recommend looking into organic ketchups that capture the flavor of the tomatoes.  Or, make your own that doesn't resemble something of steak or bbq sauce.  It's the only flavor I'd say is missing from the menu that I, personally, would enjoy.  But, it doesn't stop me from coming back."}
{"text":"Happy Dog is exactly what you would expect a bar serving custom made hot dogs to be like: awesome. Go if you are interested in checking out an absolute dive (in the best way possible), complete with pinball machines and a relaxed attitude from all the staff.  My wife and I went and absolutely loved the experience. I ordered a meat dog, and went nuts on the toppings. They give some recommendations, but be prepared to struggle with what you want to add and what you are going to leave off your dog. We also ordered the tater tots, and let's just say their generosity with the sauces was appreciated.  The only reason that I dropped the rating 4 stars instead of 5 is because the vegan dog that my wife ordered was surprisingly mediocre. I don't necessarily need a vegan dog to taste like meat, but I do want it not to taste like a chemical.  All in all, this is a heartily recommended joint when in Cleveland. Order a meat hot dog and tater tots, skip the vegan dog, and thank me later."}
{"text":"This place is the best! If you don't eat here, you haven't experienced Cleveland.  Awesome value for what you get - There are tons of different condiments (look at some of the pics), and you get to pick & choose which you want to have.. Everything is delicious, the ambience is fun, the owner (who unfortunately just passed away) seems like a great guy, and they've often got live music.   Check it out, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I almost feel bad holding at four stars for Happy Dog, but feel that its many charms are held in check by fairly high prices for a dive bar.  So, many positives here: it's the got that postwar-diner charm that about half of West Side Cleveland dives have, it's got pinball, free parking, occasional live music, a cool jukebox, a really solid selection of crafts and imports, and friendly, competent servers, some of whom are themselves local musicians.  And then let's talk about this bar grub: the main thing is the hot dog, available in beef or veggie form (the latter premade, but definitely good). You order via a card full of check boxes, letting you add pretty much as many toppings and sauces as they can fit on the damned thing. (Forget about picking it up; unless you've got ninja-like dexterity, you're going to need a knife and fork for these.) Options range from sriracha to fried eggs, saurkraut to garbanzo bean chili and Spaghetti-O's, the latter in case you've decided to supplement your alcohol with that other drug everybody does these days. It's about the most fun experience of this kind of food that you could ask for. Same goes with the tater tots: they're good if fairly standard until you load them up with the weird and wonderful assortment of add-ons (charged per item for the tots) and then dip them in the wide variety of tasty sauces like thai chile--none of this catsup, ranch and blue cheese nonsense holding you back.   But $6 for an a la carte hot dog is a bit rich for the 'Land, as is the $6-$8 most of the craft brews run. I like Happy Dog, dig its rock n' roll ethos, and will happily visit again next time I'm in town. But I feel that it's just not quite five-star value."}
{"text":"Dang close to a perfect hot dog. Both the chorizo chili and sloppy joe fixings were amazing. The sauce selection is amazing too. Great local spot to eat, definitely not every week if u kno what I mean."}
{"text":"We had two types at Progressive Field. Very good but the ordinary less than nutritious bun ruined it. We are the dog and filling with a fork!"}
{"text":"Pretty cool dive bar that I would definitely return to, especially anytime that I'm looking for a hot dog. Solid draft list running from local and national craft beers, to covering the bases of standard domestics available. Bartenders were friendly, and readily available. I could imagine the place getting pretty loud when a live band is playing, so personally I'd avoid during these times, but if you're into that, perfect place to see local acts. Big fan of their food menu. Just take a sheet, check off whatever you'd like on your dog. This method leaves no concern for miscommunications. There are so many potential toppings that anyone can find a dog that will make them happy, and that they probably couldn't get anywhere else. My fiance chose to get a burger instead of a hot dog, and was happy with her choice. We also split a side of tater tots, and were pleased, especially with the many choices of dipping sauces (we chose the garlic aioli). Definitely a place that we would come back again to get the easy, laid back, dive atmosphere, to go along with some outstanding hot dogs and drinks."}
{"text":"I came to Happy Dog with high expectations, so my experience here while visiting Cleveland was quite a letdown. Looking at their menu and yelp reviews, I expected foodie hot dog heaven. However, it was not to be. I ordered one of their signature dogs, the east meets west. The concept was great: peanut butter, bahn mi veggies, chili oil, and garlicky escarole on a hot dog. I'd had something similar a while ago, but this sounded like it would even one up that wonderful dog. In actuality, it was kind of bland, egiven all those ingredients. The escarole was way out of proportion to the rest of the elements and dominated the experience. I pulled some off, but then was treated to a mouthful of poorly pickled veggies and bun soaked through with chili oil and escarole juice. I think if the proportions had been right, this may have at least been acceptable, but I just couldn't get that bite to happen for me. Also, the bun was cheap... It's touted as being locally baked, but it's just like any other 6 for $2 type of cheap white buns you get at the grocery... Certainly nothing to brag about. I will say that the hot dog was fantastic... Thick, meaty, and juicy with loads of flavor. I'd write it off as a poor menu selection if my wife's Alabama Homewrecker wasn't equally wanting. Also, the tots were rather disappointing. I ordered them with a sunny side up egg, sriracha, and chipotle hollandaise. Portion size was good for the money. The hollandaise was pretty good... Not real heavy on the chipotle flavor, but still enjoyable. However, the egg was a bit overdone and just sort of plopped on top of a mound of tots. There wasn't enough yolk to coat more than a handful of the tots, so the rest were left lacking my selected flavor combination. When I could capture the flavors on one bite, it was yummy. However, leaving off the modifiers, the tots were basically the same ones I had growing up in the cafeteria. No special seasoning or anything, not homemade, just frozen tater tots. I honestly expected more based in their foodie pretentions. Service was almost nonexistent and ambience is that if a local dive bar hangout (which, apparently, it was). All in all, Happy Dog simply can't live up to the promises it's menu makes."}
{"text":"My sister is vegan and she's been trying to get me to trek all the way from the Eastside to the Westside to visit this place. Well our cousins from out of town visited and we decided to go here for lunch one afternoon. Now I seriously regret not going here sooner! This place has some of the best hot dogs and the selection to put on the hot dog is outrageous. When I first got the list of what I could put on my hot dog I was overwhelmed. You could go here every day and try a new combination. Everyone loved their food and this has become one of my favorite places to eat in Cleveland!!! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Loved it....good hot dogs...endless options of toppings to add to it. Great spot to hang out after work and grab some good food!"}
{"text":"DON'T EVER GO HERE UNLESS YOU WANT TO RISK YOUR MONEY BEING STOLEN FROM YOUR BANK ACCOUNT! It saddens me that I have to give Happy Dog 1 star, so let me explain. I used to talk this place up and send all my friends here. Until one evening I had a very bad experience, an experience that will require me to never step foot in this establishment again.  I had the worst service by a male server ever...Let me begin the list: very rude, short answers, would answer our questions as he walked away, no refills on drinks, didn't ask if we needed to-go boxes, didn't ask how we wanted the check (it was myself and a friend) I paid with my debit card and was so displeased that I only left him a $2 tip.  Then to my dismay - after checking my bank statement a week later, it seems that he changed my tip into a $9 tip! HE STOLE MY MONEY! I attempted to call and speak to a manager or the owner, but one was never available. If he stole from me, then I'm sure he's doing it to others.  What a sick individual. I will NEVER go here again and make sure that I let EVERYONE I know to also follow suit."}
{"text":"This has been a favorite and you won't be disappointed.    Very diverse toppings and wonderful atmosphere.  Two minor things.   1. As a long time diner here - why change your fries? They where perfect and crunchy and they paired well with your sauces.    The fresh cut fries were not as good.    Also did you go with a smaller frank?   Just an observation.     Please don't let anything I said negatively influence you."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend both attended this place a week ago because all we heard was great reviews among friends. It was crowded, but we were able to walk around to get a place at the bar to sit. The bartender was prompt in coming to us and asking for our drink orders. I of course had to ask about their IPA selection on draft. They only had a couple, but they had plenty more in bottles. I was overwhelmed with the topping selection that they had for this place. The bar tender was more than willing to give their opinions about their favorite topping selections. They have everything ranging from stadium mustard to a fried egg. Combinations that you will never figure would taste good together, were pretty delicious. It was like a experiment of delicious goodness. They have the normal beef franks and veggie franks to choose from. Paying min $5 for 1/4 lb beef frank might sound crazy to some, but the experience here is something that all must try."}
{"text":"I had heard about this place for over a year, and finally I decided that it was time, especially because I had a craving for a hot dog.  The trip was definitely worth it.  Parking a little tough to come by, but that may be because it was a Friday night.  I took a seat at the bar and there were plenty of choices to be made from the get.  First decision to make is what to wet the palate and accompany the food that will soon enough be shoveled into your mouth (I chose the North Shore Scrimshaw Pilsner which didn't disappoint).  Next, you had to decide what toppings you wanted on your hot dogs (you'll definitely want more than one--$5 per dog)...this can take a while and I think you just have to go with your gut and try whatever combination suits your fancy.  I didn't get the fries or tots ($3 per order plus $1 per topping), but looked very tempting.  The last decision to make is how you're going to eat your hot dog...fork n' knife or with your hands....no judgement here on which way you go.  In the end, I think most people are happy with whatever combination of orders they make...I know I was quite happy with my meal.  The only downside I can see to this place is that the service is a little slow, but it's a bar as well....so you might just have to be a little more aggressive in getting your orders in."}
{"text":"Happy Dog never lets me down. It's a bar that serves hot dogs and tater tots. The awesomeness of Happy Dog is that you can choose between a different bunch of toppings from Andy's Hot Fries or slaw to fried egg. The tater tots comes with all kinds of free dip - chipotle ketchup, garlic aioli, sriracha, truffle mustard. It's not gourmet, but it's good.  Trivia some nights, Classical Revolution once a month, random acts throughout the week. It's a Cleveland landmark in my opinion."}
{"text":"It takes a lot to get me out of the house to socialize with other humans.  But the promise of a $5 vegan hot dog with unlimited topping choices (from a list of a gazillion) is enough for this girl to get her butt out the door and into the world.    I had been there once before but I was not aware of this magical hotdog menu and I thought it was just another crowded bar with lots of tall young men with curiously thick beards and girls with tattoos.  (No offense to those people-  my boyfriend is tall and has a beard and I have tattoos) Not until I read on Greendogwine.com (the fun website of a local foodie chicks' adventures) that this place was not your average bar.  I took a friend of mine to Happy Dog on a Saturday night.  The place was packed wall-to-wall.  Like, hard to move or breathe packed.  We each had to pay a $5 cover charge to see a band I wasn't interested in seeing, which is kind of annoying because I just came for the food but I was on a mission and nothing was going to stop me.  Except ALL THESE FREAKIN' PEOPLE IN MY WAY.  There was no place to sit, not really even a place to comfortably stand without being way too intimately close with a stranger BUT the hotdog gods were watching us that night.  We lucked out and got 2 seats at the bar that a guy was saving for some friends that didn't show up.  Hallelujah!  Food:  We ordered beer (don't ask me what kind, I only drink beer with intention to loosen my uptight ass up a little- or a lot) and got our hotdog checklist and little pencils.  This moment felt so sweet, I was giddy.  I got the vegan dog with kimchi, a pickle, tomato and something else that I forgot and fries with 4 different dipping sauces (I would have gotten all the dipping sauces but I didn't want to look too greedy).  My friend got the regular hotdog with kimchi, a pickle and a fried egg on tip and tator tots smothered in cheese. I expected to wait awhile since they were so busy but I was surprised and pleased when we got our dogs in about 10 minutes.  My vegan dog was everything I wanted and more.  A few bites into it I thought \"Damn, I'm gonna need another one\", but I actually got full really fast and couldn't finish my last bite.  The fries were great and the dipping sauces were fab.  Service:  Nothing but smiles all around.   They were appropriately staffed on such a busy night with the sweetest tattooed lady bartenders.  We never once had to wait for a beer refill, someone was always right there to swoop in and get us more drinks.  I was very impressed with the tight ship they run there.   I would be so overwhelmed with that crowd but they worked it like pros.  And the speed in which my dog was delivered to me was exceptional.  I will be back.  Soon."}
{"text":"Fantastic place- wish I lived closer by.  I loved making two Frankenstein hot dogs with totally random ingredients on top.  Couldn't believe I was paying $5 each.  I felt a little guilty but shoved the feeling down with a mouthful of Frankendog.  If I lived around here I would be here all the time."}
{"text":"Laid back environment with a great beer selection and an as-adventurous-as-you-dare menu of hot dog toppings. Also, the vegan dog is delish (and I'm not even a vegetarian). Beers are a little over priced for the area, but all in all this place offers a good bang for your buck. I've been here 3x so far, and each time the service was attentive and ready to make recommendations on the next round. My closing advice is to try every last sauce on the menu. They are all so good."}
{"text":"Stopped in with my wife and was pleasantly surprised with the menu and food.  The hotdogs were fresh and kosher the tater tots or crunchy the toppings were fantastic and the dipping sauces were superb. I highly recommend this bar because it's really fun and it has really good food."}
{"text":"Went here late last night for a quick bite. Have some opinions of this place that aren't fully percolated... need another visit to get a better impression. But for now, it's four stars. Why? Well, on this night the service was fast and friendly. The bar area was cool, in a dive bar kinda way. The beer list was decent. The food was not awesome but it was good. One of the dipping sauces tasted very similar to one of the sauces from bspot... Forget which one, the mole I think. The Elvis lamp deserves a higher rating on its own. I need to return for a better review."}
{"text":"I'm not always a huge Hot Dog fan but the condiments to top your Dogs is insanely awesome!!!  You can't get better than that so between the selections to personalize your Dog and the Beer selection is pretty solid as well plus you might be able to check out a band or two or even DJ's depending on the night is solid!!!!    Both West and East side locations have something to offer.  West side is cool but you definitely feel like you are walking into a 70's UAW hall.  East side will always have a special place in my heart from the days of The Euclid Tavern and I'm glad that Happy Dog kept part of the name to keep the history intact with that spot plus that whole area is coming along quite nicely!"}
{"text":"Great place...when there's not a band playing too loud. Great service usually. Parking is decent and they have a Bike Box."}
{"text":"It is extremely rare (I think it may have only happened once) for me to give 5 stars on a first visit.  I think 5 stars should be reserved for places that are excellent on a consistent basis.  I was here with my daughter who has been here many times and she and her friends all confirmed that Happy Dog is consistently excellent every time so it just didn't seem fair not to give it the 5 stars it deserved on my visit. What is Happy Dog?  It's a neighborhood bar that serves hot dogs and fries.  It puts pretty much anything on the dogs that you could think of.  A variety of cheeses and veggies, goofy items like lucky charms, blue cheese coleslaw, pickles, chili, kraut, condiments... You sit at the bar (or a table if that's your style) and they give you a checklist like in a sushi place.  You pick out how you want your dog and give the server the slip.  Now enjoy a beer while you wait for your food. Oh, you only gave them one slip?  What's wrong with you!!!!! Get off your butt and fill out another slip!  You can't just try one crazy dog!  Expand your horizons and your waistline and get no less than two awesome happy dogs!!! Next time I return I'm ordering 3 happy dogs.  I'm staying here for a couple hours and I'm drinking at least 4 beers.  There's almost no reason to leave a place like Happy Dog and certinly no excuse for being in the area and not giving it a try!"}
{"text":"Delicious! My husband and I love this place, but I think is missing some spicy toppings, like jalapeños or some kind of spicy sauce. The tots are amazing!! Don't let go the sweet potatoe fries too!!"}
{"text":"AMAZING.   As a vegetarian, I was thrilled to find somehwere with veggie hotdogs. And the toppings! Oh goodness, there are so many that your head will spin. That's the only bad part, it's hard to decide what to get!  The food is great though so you can't go wrong.    Solid beer selection and live music some nights, which is very fun. A must see in Cleveland. I recommend it to all of my friends."}
{"text":"What a fun time! My family and I headed here from Brunswick to give it a try. We'll be back, the food and staff were awesome. Our waitress/barmaid was friendly and helpful with menu selections.  The food was a pleasant surprise, yep, the tater tots were good but the dipping sauces for them made it really fun. We experimented with the dipping sauces and loved all 8 that we tried.  The hot dogs were excellent and the vodka sauerkraut was killer!"}
{"text":"Like I said before, If they were a little more accommodating to first timers then I'd give them a five.  I guess sometimes I just don't pay attention because in fact they do have a suggestion list.  I personally didn't really care for any of the suggestions, but it gave me something to go off of.  I will still stand my my thoughts that they need to give a little more description on some of their toppings.   It is nice to know that you can get a massive dog and tots for $7.50.  Toppings are free so you can load up on them and fill your tummy to the max.   My dog this time consisted of alien relish, bourbon baked beans and some fancy pants mustard that I can't remember the name of.  It was fantastic.  I have also in the past gotten the crunch peanut butter and chocolate mole which was also fantastic.   Who knew hot dogs could be this good.  I think they might even surpass Jacob field's all beef kosher dogs."}
{"text":"I think Happy Dog probably is a lot better after a couple beers than at 11 am on saturday. I came here for lunch last week and it was just okay. Picking out the toppings (its unlimited for $5 per hot dog) was super fun and I may have gone a bit overboard. The hot dog didn't really taste that good but it could have been my fault due to bad topping combinations. The tots and dipping sauces were yummy. Maybe picking different toppings would have created a better dog. Overall, It was a fun experience. The beer selection is great. Lots of local stuff on tap and in bottles. If I came back, I would come at night for more of the bar aspect."}
{"text":"I give it two stars because I think the service is good and they have a decent beer selection. Any true hot dog lover couldn't possibly like this place, right?  Their ketchup isn't even good.  Poppy seed bun does not work for me either.   I agree w/ the other guy who says it really isn't even a 'dive' bar which it is trying so hard to be.  Go to steve's or the other great hot dog place on Lorain for some good hot dogs."}
{"text":"For just \"a hot dog shop\" this place has got it. Every topic imaginable you could put on your hot dog! I went ona. Sunday afternoon but I hear sometimes there is entertainment. Definitely a place you need to go if you are spending some time in cleveland"}
{"text":"Great food, live music, fun ambiance, and delicious (but not necessarily healthy!) food! If I lived in Cleveland, I'd probably be a regular. And I'll probably go back next time I'm in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Location is a little iffy, but the food and service top the list!   Any dog you get will be amazing! I had the sloppy joe dog with yellow mustard. And some tater tots with 5 different dipping sauces.  Great selection of beer, wine selection is red or white, not the best, but most people don't go hear for the wine selection.  Great for groups, every 3rd Tuesday of the month is classical music day."}
{"text":"Happy dog is one of those places you go for a new twist on comfort food and good beer. There are so many different, unique toppings to put on your hot dog, it would be crazy to get the same thing twice. The tater tots are great too because they come with a choice of dipping sauces and you can get as many as you want! It is a pretty simple concept but the food is always excellent! They also have great music pretty much every night so it is also a good place to go for happy hour which turns in to a night out. I would definitely recommend Happy Dog!"}
{"text":"I am not a hot dog fan, however, the burgers and shuffle board in the basement are truly awesome... over 50 toppings to choose from and don't forget the TOTS!  My buddies all love the hot dogs, so I'll take their word for it.  Only issue with the place, the bands are to loud on saturday and they need to install more shuffle board tables."}
{"text":"Great staff, cheap food, good beer, fantastic juke box.  If I died in Cleveland, hopefully it would be here."}
{"text":"I'm so happy to be able to finally review this place! I'm pretty sure I'm the last Clevelander to go to the Happy Dog.  First of all, they get 5 stars simply for having Original Sin on tap.  Yum!  I'm not a hot dog fan.  The Happy Dog changed my mind.  I highly doubt you'll ever see me chowing down on a hot dog at Jacob's Field but the hot dogs at the Happy Dog are so well made and fresh.  I love the variety of toppings as well.  I look forward to going back and changing it all up again.  The tater tots!  I could give a whole 5 star review just on those delicious tater tots!  I look forward to returning!"}
{"text":"Went to Happy Dog on a Saturday cuz me and the girlfriend were dying for a dog with Everything Cream Cheese.  Seriously, you guys are geniuses for thinking that stuff up and I have stole that recipe as my own for a party dip. BUT When we showed up there was a band playing, that was loud on the outside and when we got in, had to shout to the guy at the door 3-4 times about getting in, that there was a $4 cover ($8 for the both of us).  I COULD NOT HEAR THE GUY A FOOT AWAY. I COULD NOT HEAR ANYTHING. I left. I'm not paying extra to go deaf and I'd like to talk to the person I go with.  I wouldn't mind the cover if the band was playing at a volume that didn't cause instant ear damage. We are 20-somethings, I love metal, rock and rap so loud music is normally not a problem.  But if you actually wanted to listen to the bad, stand outside. Happy Dog, you missed out on a $30+ check from booze and food because your band was too loud and you wanted to charge us to go deaf.  Your establishment is too small to necessitate amps, or at least don't let the band turn it up so loud. Your place is small, you don't need it that loud.  We went to the Melt instead and it was fantastic.  I will rate you guys again next time I visit and that rating will be about food and service.  This one was about how I was unable to eat here."}
{"text":"I was thrilled when I got to this place for my friends birthday and found out their gimmick was a hot dog with over 50 toppings!  It was surprisingly good and so were the tater tots with quality nacho cheese all over them.    But then, and I hate to base this on one \"special\" night, this guy got on stage to introduce \"Visual Night\".  All of a sudden there were horrid home made films on the screen with people just screaming on the top of their lungs on film.  You couldn't talk over it and the films themselves were honestly the grossest things I have ever seen.  It totally killed her bday.  Luckily we were all good sports about going elsewhere but they lost a lot of business that night.    Just the fact that they never mentioned to my friend who planned her bday there that this would be the theme of the night and there was no warning whatsoever, nor an apology to anyone was really a turn off."}
{"text":"This is an awesome local joint.  It is a little pricey for a hotdog, $5, but you do get to put a ton of stuff on.  Tator tots were great too.  I am a bigger guy and one hot dog, tator tots, and a coffee porter were enough to keep me from starving.    The biggest hazard here, I would say is a lot of beard and thick rimmed glasses.  This is not said to put anyone down, but to warn suburbanites venturing into the cityish areas what they will encounter.   I also went on the night when there was a band.  The band was decent, but it is a very small venue.  I would not reccomend going if you do not like who is playing or are not in the mood for a very loud evening.    But service was awesome, even at a packed bar and I will definatley go back next time in need a huge hotdog.  Also the roasted garlic aeoli (probably spelled wrong) is awesome on the tots."}
{"text":"YES!!!! So delicious! I was very happy about this place! Delicious dogs and burgers with fun toppings and sauces. Warning: the portions are generous. You will need to knife and fork the dogs. And if you order a side of tots or fries, it's enough for 2 very hungry people or four people who just want some tots. Um, also you can order crushed Bugles and everything bagel cream cheese as toppings. Sold."}
{"text":"Happy Dog is one of those places that if your order sucks, it's your own fault.  But chances are, your order won't suck.  Happy Dog has four main menu items: hot dogs, veggie dogs, tater tots, and french fries.  Of course, there are over 50 topping to add to said main items.  If you're overwhelmed like I was, they have a handy cheat sheet of ideas to choose from.  This is the route I went for.  Everyone else at my table just picked their own toppings.  And go figure, they all LOVED their choices while mine was just \"okay.\"  I don't blame the restaurant.  I blame myself.  My dog had crunchy peanut butter, red chili chocolate mole sauce, and applewood smoked bacon.  If I could order all over again (which I hopefully will soon), I'd get the peanut butter and their jelly sauce.  I tried the jelly sauce on my tots and loved it.  No idea why I didn't think to put it on my dog alongside the PB.  Silly me.  The problem was that the mole overpowered everything else.  My boyfriend topped his dog with chili, bacon, a fried egg, potato chips, vodka sauerkraut, bakes beans, and nacho cheese.  It was a monstrosity but he loved it.  I'd get sick if I even attempted the thing.  He has a stomach of iron.  I wish I could tell you what sauces I tried for the tots, but as it was a Yelp meetup, our table shared at least 10 different sauces.  My favorites were the grape jelly and chili sauce,, the black truffle mustard, and the chimichurri.  It's really all a matter of personal taste, though.  My boyfriend and I have decided this is going to be our \"go-to\" place when we want a cheap dinner away from home.  A hot dog and fries will run you a mere $7.50 total, and the dog is pretty big.  All toppings are free of charge, so if you load up like my boyfriend did, you'll get more than full from your meal.  Beyond the food, i love the feel of this place.  It's down-to-earth and full of real, laid-back people.  No prissy atmosphere here.  The staff are super friendly, helpful, and patient (which is saying something when you have a group of 20).  Highly recommend this place for good comfort food and a relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"great food and the prices are reasonable. beer list was solid."}
{"text":"The music and I have a love/hate relationship.  Sometimes the music is amazing, other times it's a loud screamo, can't talk or hear anything.  But I loved the set that played last time.    I love the low-key, college divey bar with 80's arcade games.  It makes the atmosphere feel so much more comfortable and laid back- slightly reminescent of Cheers dare I say?  The hot dogs are so so good- deep fried heavenly goodness.  They had toppings galore and with the imaginative sauces.  Plenty of spicy sauces- although, I am a little disappointed with the less than hot Momocho habanero sauce.  I was hoping for some kick to it.  But i loved the fried egg, bacon, wasabi mayo, siracha sauce, truffle mustard, sport peppers, pickles, cucumbers and roma tomatoes (I need some vegetables to balance out the meal haha).  I could take or leave their house made ketchup though (their ketchup has a large honey component that gives a different flavor- something to be tried at least once).    The tator tots are to die for- 3.00 for a mound of tots and unlimited toppings.  I recommend getting the wasabi mayo, nacho cheese, truffle mustard, and their ketchup isn't bad with the tots.    Don't even get me started on the beers-  I love their selection of beer- some mainstream beers, but lots of harder to find/uniquely flavored beers (I LOVE their peanut butter cup coffee beer!!)  I wasn't amazed with Bell's Winter Ale though, surprisingly light for a winter ale.  I would get the Bell's Two Hearted Ale and the Centennial one again though!"}
{"text":"Writing my review last week prompted me to give Happy Dog another shot. I talked my fiance into ditching our diets for the night and stopping in for some dogs on the way home from work. And I am really glad I did! First improvement: they were actually open! YAY! We settled into a table, ordered some dogs and tots, and started people watching. The Happy Dog sure does bring in a mixed crowd of people. At one table you have a young couple with kids enjoying their meal, at the other table there are two business men chowing down on some franks over paperwork and at another table a group of middle aged stoners were celebrating a birthday... \"Duuuude, I'm gonna get kimchee on my wiener...for real, man\". It was great entertainment. Our server was sweet and attentive even though she was pretty busy. For our first time we both ordered one of the suggested combos on the menu. I had the one with baked beans and my fiance had the one with the chocolate mole. They were both great combinations! We were almost tempted to order a third with our own combination of toppings to split, but we were kind to our waistline and didn't. My only, and minor, complaint was that the dogs and toppings could have been a little hotter, tempurature wise, when they reached our table. We shared an order of the tots with a couple of dipping sauces. The chimichurri was delish! I'm thinking I will actually add it to my hot dog on our next visit. All in all, our 2nd Happy Dog experience was what we were hoping it would be the first time around and we can't wait to go back.   PS - one of the owners sent me a message after my first review to acknowledge the mistake with the hours and apologized. I guess they went to a 1pm open after the Super Bowl and never changed their site. I appreciated that. They reached out to me in the appropriate way (PM instead of attaching some lame response onto my review like others have done) and were not at all defensive or angry about my initial review. Well done, Happy Dog."}
{"text":"The Happy Dog East/Euclid Tavern is a kindly cousin to the other Happy Dog on the West Side. The dogs are good quality and delicious, the toppings, tots and fries are premo, the bar well stocked and the service is good. .Along with that, this one being a watering hole for the CWRU crowd, there are no shortage of bands as well as talks and mini-symposiums for the nerdy crowd (present company included.) I recently got to sit in as, amazingly, a bar full of people cheered not at a band or a randy comedian, but at the fact that we'd finally reached the planet(oid) Pluto with a probe.   The Happy Dog East makes me happy:)"}
{"text":"Damn! Damn! Damn! What a crazy awesome hot dog. I got the Southern Dog with pulled pork, greens, beer cheese, and grilled onions. The dog was unique and tasty. It wasn't a gimmick food with unique toppings, it was a quality product with unique toppings and I will return!"}
{"text":"Very good food! Especially if you like delicious sloppy hot dogs. The one bar tender seemed stressed out and overwhelmed. Maybe could have had a second person to help out."}
{"text":"Happy Dog serves hot dogs, and veggie dogs, french fries, and tater tots. That's it. But they do it so well! You create your own dog by selecting from a long list of toppings. They all make a variety of sauces for the dogs and tots/ fries in house. Trust me, it's hard to just pick a few!  Happy Dog is certainly on my Top 10 vegan-friendly place to try in Cleveland! http://veganhostess.com/vegan-cleveland-restaurants-coffee-shops-more/"}
{"text":"I am not a hot dog fan at all and I try to avoid eating them. However, this is the only place where I'd want to order more than one hot dog! There are so many toppings and sauces to choose from which is super fun. The food is delicious. Top your hot dog with a fried egg and order a side of tots and you'll be wanting more soon"}
{"text":"We were in Cleveland for a concert and wanted to try a local spot for lunch so we decided on Happy Dog and we're so glad we did! With all the fun crazy toppings, the really good hotdogs and the tater tots this joint is everything it's supposed to be plus some! If you've got a craving for a great dog you've gotta try Happys."}
{"text":"College dive bar ambience (reminds me of columbus!) with staggering array dips and sauces.  Next time, I'm getting extra chimmichurri, and I'll be sure to go early, since I'm there for the food, not the scene."}
{"text":"Hit this place up one afternoon in the summer (last week) with friends. I can't say I hated it, no really, the place was awesome.   The crowd was a decent size mix of after work and hipsters from the neighborhood. The staff were very friendly, knew the menu and beers really well. I would go back again even if I didn't like the food, which was not the case.  I got the Brazilian Chimichuri Dog? and tots with a couple of dipping sauces. I was very pleased and stuffed for well under $20. This place is a great stop if you want something casual with a good vibe and good people. I will go back."}
{"text":"The hot dogs are really delicious and inexpensive and it's a lot of fun picking out what to put on them. You can go crazy heaping on toppings, so you're unlikely to leave hungry."}
{"text":"Not much to say about Happy Dog that hasn't been said yet, but here I go anyway! Food is not exactly gourmet, but still tasty and goes great with some friends and beer. The list of toppings for hot dogs and sauces for the tots is pretty awesome, and any place with vegetarian and vegan options wins extra points in my book. Service can be a bit iffy, and there have been a couple times when my friends and I felt like we were being ignored. But this is usually on the busier nights, and it's not enough to put me off coming back. Trivia nights are more fun than expected, and the Hot Dog University events are a great way to expand your brain while you trash your liver. All in all, not flashy, but still a great hangout spot!"}
{"text":"How can you not love this place?!  Check it out if you haven't by now."}
{"text":"First, let me say I managed a Hot Dog Restaurant in Chicago. I thought that place was good- but Happy Dog is better. I went last night around 7pm. It was a little packed, but that's OK. The music was loud, but not too loud. Had that comfy feeling of a neighborhood bar.  The service was good. I am a service freak (too many years managing restaurants) and I wasn't expecting much. I was very pleasantly surprised. It was pretty prompt and very friendly.  Now, the food. If you look and think $5 for a hot dog, $3 for fries or tater tots is a little high? Then you're not alone. The prices seem high- until you look at the toppings and dipping sauces. My mind boggled when I saw the 50 different toppings to choose from. I ended up with chorizo chili, smoke Gouda cheese, sauteed onions, and a pickle. It was heavenly. I didn't remember what dipping sauces for the tater tots were chosen, but they were yummy!  The tater tots were good tater tots, but next time I am going to get the fries.  Overall, a great experience."}
{"text":"Yup. Great food, great prices, great dive bar vibe. Order the Jeff- all beef dog, bacon, cream cheese, habanero pickled onions, and chimchuri. Yup."}
{"text":"I like to come here for a reasonably priced drink with a friend.  Not a fan of dogs, or tots, so eat before you come if you're not a fan either.  Not sure why everyone who works here wears ugly plaid shirts, but hey, I'm judgey."}
{"text":"It's such a simple concept but oh so amazing of one. Build your own hot dogs. I made my good ole regular frank into a southern heaven by adding smoked greens, beans, Mac n cheese, and a fried egg. It was so delicioso.   But the best part was the beer. The Willoughby Brewing chocolate peanut butter cup coffee porter has to be the best thing I've tasted in a long time. I was so saddened to find out that the brewery doesn't can or bottle their beer. Guess I'll just have to return to Cleveland to have it. (PSA: that porter does in fact include coffee, so drink at your own discretion...I was awake way longer than I cared to be.)"}
{"text":"This to me is a serious west side institution.  I lived here when I was a WESTIE I mean seriously every Friday night after work we would stop for happy hour beers a five dollar dog if we're gonna be out all night to five dollar dogs and we would hit the strip of bars and restaurants all divey but HIPSTER DIVEY.  Like where you think it's a local dive but you are spending $6-$8 on a beer - so not divey.   This place has the hipster culture in full force - pinball machine, random Elvis lamp, and bartenders with hoodies, slouchy hats and that poet-esque skinny jean.   The suggestion menu is there for folks that I think are afraid of getting a nasty combo when they've not thought about 108 toppings they could mix n match for a dog of perfection.  For me I am sure I've never made the same dog twice - in fact before my trip to the east side location in February the only yes I must have was a fried egg - even I've now branched out and I'm a self admitted foodie  banshee - and I won't eat the calories after having kids unless every bite is worth it (as it's sticking with me).   But I digress so - delicious toppings that are must tries in no particular order...obviously the aforementioned fried egg, the spectacular southern bacon spiked greens, the pimento Mac n Cheese, that ridiculously good white cheese fondue, spaghettiOs and don't judge yes I said SpaghettiOs, Momocho mole sauce, homemade in-house sloppy Joe, Bourbon baked beans, just pick some numbers and try it out you can't go wrong!   Prop shout out to the employees who didn't freak out when her 15 month old twins really made a mess no matter how much we cleaned up! Xo"}
{"text":"Visited on a whim while looking for Polish Boys. I'm glad we found this instead. Each order is a slip where you can choose unique and delicious toppings for a burger or quarter pound hot dog. What's incredible is that all hit dogs are $6, regardless of topping quantity.  I got a dog with pimento mac n cheese, marinated cremini mushrooms, cheddar cheese, top secret fry sauce, bourbon pork-n-beans and bacon-spiked southern-style greens. Basically a hot dog topped with a soul food kitchen. Every ingredient was savory and delicious. Easily top of the list in my hot dog eating experiences.  Ye olde girlfriend got a dog with spaghetti-os and cole slaw. The cole slaw had a bit of kick to it and the spaghetti-os gave a unique richness to the dish.  We also got a side of tots with BBQ dust and 3 dipping sauces. The homemade ketchup tastes like it was sweetened with applesauce, a welcome change from the common ketchups. This was my favorite. The top secret fry sauce and porter honey mustard were good too.  As a bonus, I was able to score a cream ale for $2. Bottom line: if you swing by Cleveland, don't miss this place."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING. I love the idea of putting everything you can on a hot dog. The hot dog is such a simple food, but Happy Dog really transforms it into something delectable.   Every person who goes can be a chef. We get to create our own combinations from their crazy list of toppings and so every hot dog that comes out is perfection for the person eating it. It's also got a great bar and lots of beers on tap. It's great for fun night with a lot of friends or just a relaxing date-night for two. You could even make the journey alone (I saw a guy reading at the bar enjoying his dogs), but so much more fun sharing the tater tots and chowing down with others.  Trivia night just makes the whole place even more fun. I can't wait till one opens in university circle."}
{"text":"I'm sorry. I am just not a dive-bar type of person. I recall the dog I ate at Happy Dog quite some time ago was good. I mean, it's a hot dog, what do you want?   I do not go for the atmosphere of the Dog because it just sort of drags me down. It is not cheerful at all. Not that a dive bar attempts to be cheerful, but still, this place sort of puts me down in the dumps in terms of my emotional response. So there, I said it.   Three stars based on nice staff and good dogs."}
{"text":"Drinks, hot dogs, and tater tots. If that's what you want, this is the place to get it. They have hot dogs, vegan dogs, burgers, tater tots, fries, and sweet potato fries (that's it) and to go on each of those is a list of 50 toppings to choose from. They have a list of their signature combinations if you're not in the mood to be creative or you can create your own! The food is delicious and this is a great unique place to bring out of town guests.  They also have live music multiple days during the week and tons of beers on tap so it's a good hangout. It's dark and divey but not in a bad way, it has character. The service is fast and polite and you will definitely be happy with your food and drinks."}
{"text":"Bar: strong mixed drinks and a large selection of beers. Also the staff is great at working a bust circle bar.   Food: hot dogs upstairs and burgers downstairs. Hot dogs are dogs they make there, either regular or a vegan \"sausage\". THEN toppings galore. Anything from baked beans to black truffle honey mustard. There are 50 options and for 5 bucks you get a hearty hot dog worth 5 bucks alone PLUS as many toppings as you want (even all 50). Tator tots and fries with dipping sauces (also as many as you want from that selection for 3 bucks).  I don't know much about the burgers except that they have them and I'm pretty sure they work similarly.   Atmosphere: very busy on a Thursday. All I will say is that the Happy Dog is a HIP place to be with a lot of HIP people. So if those aren't your kind of people... Suck it up because the hot dogs are great!"}
{"text":"What an awesome concept. For around five bucks you can get a juicy wiener (heh) Or a veggie dog with literally any topping you can think of. Are you drunk or high? Great: Get frootloops on your hotdog! Once I got peanut butter, relish, and siracha on my hotdog (apparently Michael Simon's pairings) and it was DELICIOUS. Who knew peanut butter would taste so good on a hotdog?! Oh, and GET THE TOTS.   It's definately divey inside and kinda smells funky. Needs major renovation, but really, who cares where you are when you choose hotdogs this good as your dinner item.   All in all, this place just rocks."}
{"text":"Happy dog might be my new happy place. My boyfriend and I got lucky and snagged two bar stools Friday night during happy hour. But not just any happy hour, Polka Happy Hour. I come from a Polish family, so this was music to my ears! Such a fun and different happy hour. The place was beyond crowded so this definitely must be a crowd pleaser.  And talk about some awesome hot dogs. Definitely hands down the best veggie dog I've ever had. Topped off with some veggie chili, slaw, and caramelized onions...what a stunner. Plus the portion was huge...luckily the boyfriend had no trouble finishing off mine for me.  Also, just get the tots. Just do yourself the favor and order the tots. They were deliciously crispy fried little bites of goodness and I couldn't get enough. We picked a bunch of dipping sauces to try, but I kept going back to the rising star coffee and ancho BBQ. It was outstanding.  Great selection of beers also, the boyfriend chose a beer that he said he hasn't been able to find anywhere else around town.  And the service was quick friendly. We were able to get refills fast, despite it being super crowded, and our food came out in less than 10 minutes. The bartenders were all smiles and checked in with us often to make sure we were okay.  My one and only criticism was the live music that came on later. It was LOUD. Like ear shattering loud. And I love live music. But the place is pretty small, it was hard to even speak to one another. It wasn't terrible, the music was pretty good. But I know it wasn't just us. Almost everyone sitting on the bar side closest to the band either relocated to the other side of the bar or went down stairs. I might make sure no ones playing next time we go.  All in all, happy dog made me a happy girl. Ridiculously cheap eats, delicious dogs and tots, and a fun atmosphere. What more can a girl ask for?"}
{"text":"This place has so much character! Character as in low key, gritty dive bar offers great music and interesting tattooes.   I first tried to come here on Dyngus Day (look it up... it's a Polish holiday) and it was insanely packed with tons of people dancing. However, I was able to come back on a Sun afternoon during Weapons of Mass Creation weekend to share a meal w/ some friends.   You can choose out of 50+ toppings what to put on your hot dog. I had a veggie hot dog with kimchi, fried egg, cucumber, tomatoes, wasabi peas, and thai chili sauce and a side of tater tots. We tried lots of the sauces... chili grape jelly sauce is amazing, garlic aioli was good and the truffle mustard (?).. delicious.   It's hard to talk over the noise, music and bands, so it's a nice place to just be w/ your fav people.  It's just such a fun place that I'll be back."}
{"text":"The best vegetarian (vegan, actually) hot dogs in Cleveland.  With all the vegan options, vegans will need some extra time to figure out how to top their deliciously cooked Field Roast dogs. I went crazy with vegetarian mac and cheese and pickled something on mine, and it was delicious.  The tater tots are not to be missed. For $5 and so many toppings, it's a real bargain.  My only complaint is that the buns are wrong. They are very soft, and when you add any kind of sauce to the dog it soaks right through, making it impossible to eat without a fork.  I only took one bite and the whole thing fell apart. I'd rather have a heartier bun, or a choice of bun (pretzel would be good) that holds up better under the weight of many toppings.  If you're not looking for a loud experience, go here during the day. At night it can be sceney and loud, which is fine, but not for me."}
{"text":"This place is my introduction to Cleveland's food culture. It is beyond-my-imagination wild.   Checklist menu makes me wonder if their servers are all lazy or if the owner wants to save money by cutting down more trees. Then putting sunny side up egg, peanut butter, pork bean sauce, fruit loops, Spaghetti O's (and a million other things) on hot dog makes all their hot dogs struggle because they are having identity crisis. They do not know if they are hot dogs, or hamburgers.   Same thing with Barrio in Lakewood. Their tacos do not know if they are tacos, or burritos.   The pinball machines, on the other hand, are classy and saving this place.   Please put yourself in the shoe of a hot dog, and let them be simply happy hot dogs instead of mutant hamburgers."}
{"text":"The vegan dog is shockingly good. I had it with at least 4 delicious toppings. Loved the garbanzo chili and the pickled toppings. It's a delightfully divey spot with a very good thing going. Excellent beer selection with plenty of local brews on tap. The service was fast, friendly, and helpful. Fries with a gazillion dipping sauces are a must. The Momocho sauce brings the heat. Great spot for kids and hipsters and hungry peeps from all walks."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Friendly staff and a great way for the kids to get creative with their food! Good prices, great beer selection and good food. Will definently revisit when we come to town"}
{"text":"Happy Dog rocks! Great selection of beers on draught. The pours are absolutely amazing. Beer to the top of the glass, very little foam, just the way us beer lovers like it. Even though the menu is limited, both the veggie dog and the regular dog are awseome. Great taste and very juicy. The toppings, well what can you say but fabulous! Same goes for the dipping sauces for the fries and tater tots. Prices are reasonable, bar is huge (goes all the way around) and the service is very good. Very comfortable place to down a few and have some food."}
{"text":"There is nothing else to say, this place is great!  Excellent Hotdog, Excellent Bun, Excellent Sides(50 Plus), and Excellent Fries and tater tots!    Try Happy Dog, you will not be upset, just very full!"}
{"text":"I've heard so much about Happy Dog and was finally able to check it out a few weeks ago. It definitely lived up to its hype!   I ordered one hot dog with a bazillion toppings on it :) I tried to order everything I liked on the check list and was at first hesitant about whether everything would taste good together. But it turned out to be super delicious! The fried egg is a definite must-have on every hot dog.   You should also order a side of the tater tots with a few of their sauces (garlic aioli and chocolate mole were some of my favorite ones!)"}
{"text":"There is so much I love about this place from the AMAZING hot dog menu, the depth and value of the beer selection, and the awesome, entertaining, personable service. The hot dog at Happy Dog is a game changer is in competition with Stuggy's in Baltimore for the best hot dog I've eaten. It is definitely on my list of \"Best Bars in America\".  I cannot wait to get back to Happy Dog.  Let's start with the hot dog. The dog itself is a hefty size with a really nice bite to the casing. It is seasoned very well and would taste great just on its own. However, there is no way you can eat a plain hot dog with more than 50 high quality toppings. The best thing is that you don't have to pay extra for certain toppings like an egg, bacon or chili. I LOVE that because it seems like they just want you to enjoy your food, not nickel and dime you to death. Since there are 50 toppings, you could never eat the same dog twice. There are  117,600 combinations of 3 toppings. To put that in perspective, if you ate 3 dogs a day, every day for a year, it would take 107 years to eat all the combinations. Therefore, every trip to Happy Dog is a new experience. Using the check off list make ordering a breeze and ensures accuracy. I even took home a list as a souvenir to show off to my friends! This menu is either the result of an indecisive and generous cook, or the product of a insane marketing genius!  The beer menu includes a lot of local and regional beers. Its satisfying, but nothing extraordinary. However, even a beer snob like me can still find a good number of interesting brews. Also, the prices are extremely agreeable. It was awesome to see Genny Cream Ale on tap for $2. LOVE IT.  All of the bartenders who waited on us were so welcoming and friendly. They made fun of us for our Yankees hats and even advised against ordering all 50 toppings because the cooks hate making it (and with good cause). They playfully teased us about being out of towners but not in a way that made us uncomfortable.  The bar is a huge long oval set up with lots of comfortable seating. The place just has that feeling of a classic bar from like the 1940's with the wood paneling and tile ceiling.  If you can't have a good time at Happy Dog, then you really should go to a therapist because it doesn't get much better than this!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here for take out...Got a solid veggie dog. (I don't eat a lot of beef and was a little weary of getting the veggie dog at worst but I was happy with it.) So basically, they have plenty of options for everyone. Menu consisted of hot dogs, tater tots, and alcohol. I didn't have much interaction with staff but everyone seemed friendly and nice. Would definitely come here again and recommend every one to stop by at least once!! Oh, and I recommend you don't make the same mistake I did... get more than just 1 dog if you're hungry, not because it's a \"small portion\" or whatever, but because it's so good and you're going to want more!!"}
{"text":"So many choices! We got the Happy Dog recommended dog and the Michael Symon one or something like that. They were really good. and the tots were great. But it wasn't one of the best dogs I have ever had and it didn't leave me with a desire to return. It's a sort of hipster place so you have to be in the right mood for that. But the beers and food were great. Hard to find a place to sit though. And I'm taking a star off for the general atmosphere of just being uninviting."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in Cleveland.  It is a chill bar but I've never had bad service.  You never know what kind of excitement the crowd will elicit. The food is great and well priced.  I find myself crazy happy dogs and making the trek from the east side.  You can also find an interestingly curated selection of craft beer. They do not disappoint."}
{"text":"Tots  truffle honey mustard - yum!"}
{"text":"Best local non chain place to eat that my whole family enjoys! The dipping sauces are made there which I love, plus the live music. My children love the staff, the tater tots with tons of toppings and the pin ball machines!"}
{"text":"I came to the Happy Dog by way of their identity as a music venue, but stayed for the hot dogs, tater tots, and dipping sauces. In 2010 I saw a good chunk of shows at the Happy Dog -- the cover charge for shows is inexpensive (typically $5-7) and they bring in a variety of local and touring bands. The Happy Dog has a simple menu, serving quarter pound all-beef hot dogs, vegan field roast sausages (these are spiced like sausages and tend to have a drier texture, they're not your typical Yves or Morningstar veggie dog), french fries, and tater tots. The real variety comes with their 50+ toppings -- my favorites include the saffron aioli, alien pickle relish, and house made ketchup (the ketchup is not for everyone, though, it has almost nothing in common with traditional bottled ketchup and is more sweet than vinegary with a rustic texture.) My partner favors the Oaxacan mole and Kansas City bbq sauce.  The decor of the Happy Dog reminds me of Al's from Happy Days, if Al had decked out his join in photos of The Replacements and Elvis Costello. There's ample seating (tables, booths, and a bar), pinball machines, a jukebox with a great selection, and a Ms. PacMan/Galaga table. The waitstaff is friendly, but fast-moving. If it's later in the night or if there's a band playing, you may have to be assertive in flagging someone down. The fact that you place your food orders by filling out a card simplified the ordering process and cuts down on the chance that a confused/overextended member of the waitstaff might get your order mixed up.  If you're a vegan, be sure to ask a member of the waitstaff about which toppings are vegan as they're not marked on the menu. Some things that might seem vegan (like the thai chile and garlic sauce, for example) actually aren't due to the inclusion of gelatin. They do keep their Facebook page updated with a list of their vegan toppings, so if you're vegan, it may be worth your time to scope that list out before dining.  It can get crowded and loud at night (especially if there's a band playing), so if you want a quieter dining experience you may want to plan to eat there earlier in the day. You can also check the calendar on the website to make sure that there isn't anything going on. Though I love seeing bands and eating at the same time, there are some nights where I just want to have a quiet, cheap meal, so it's nice that they have an up-to-date calendar available.  I've generally had very good experiences at the Happy Dog -- the only blip I can think of is that in the past my partner has noticed odd charges on his debit card after dining there (we think that someone else's order may have been attributed to his tab.) Since then, we've tried to stick to keeping things simple by paying in cash."}
{"text":"5 stars for knowing its a neighborhood bar that only serves hot dogs, fries and tator tots. But they bring out the big guns and do it right. 50, yes that is a five zero, different toppings. From the normal ketchup and mustard to the delicious chirizo chili. You can get down right crazy with the toppings. How about an egg on that dog or slap on some peanut butter for a 1-2 punch.   Neat little place, with a great twist on the hot dog. A must go eat for everyone. Not a hot dog fan, then get the veggie sausage. Winner winner, wiener dinner!!"}
{"text":"I love the idea behind this place... Picking your own toppings from a list of 57 is quite a daunting task! There are some really creative and palate-pleasing options.  I chose to go simpler with my hot dog, getting pimento Mac and cheese, cheddar, bacon, buffalo sauce, and a fries egg as my toppings.  The bun was soft and fresh, but it stood no chance against the sheer amount of goodness inside of it; It was definitely a fork and knife kind of food.  I wanted to LOVE the hotdog, but the actual dog was kind of hard and slightly overcooked for my taste.  The toppings made up for it, but the tater tots were really the star in my book! The sauces that they have to go with them are incredible.  I would make the trek back there just for an order of tots and the garlic aoli sauce... Yum!   The service was a little slow and jumbled... We never had the same person come to our table twice, and a few of us tried to order a beer (they have a pretty extensive selection on tap) but no one came back until they brought the food and by then we were content just to sip on our water."}
{"text":"Heard about this place and was dying to check it put-and I'm very glad I did! Decent beer selection and kind of a hipster vibe, but $8 for a loaded hot dog and tater tots has got to be one of the best deals in town. Tons of unique toppings to pick from and delicious dipping sauces for tots (secret fry sauce was my fav). We were there early and had no problem getting a seat at the bar, but I can see how during prime time or when live music is on how it could be kind of tight. If you're going for the food is get there earlyu because that loaded dog would have been super hard to eat while standing."}
{"text":"I've been to some good shows here, and the bar is great. In theory, the hot dogs are a fantastic idea, and the toppings are high quality, creative, and fun, but the dogs just don't deliver. The Happy Dog would be a 4 star establishment in my book if they just improved the quality of their hot dogs! Call me an east coast hot dog purist, but if it doesn't snap when I bite into it, I'm over it."}
{"text":"Best hot dog place in CLE! The set amount for one hot dog is $5 . But there are so many toppings and sauces you can put on your hotdog! And the tater tots ate so good! Nice and crispy! Service was nice,easy and quick! Only downside was that you had to pay with cash if you wanted to get your hotdog..if you want to use credit you had to buy a drink (or something like that)"}
{"text":"Hot diggity dog, I'm kinda in love with this place.   Big hot dogs with about 50 different toppings to choose from. You want fruit loops? They got 'em. I stuck with smoked gouda, oaxacan red chile & chocolate mole, marinated portobello mushrooms, and applewood smoked bacon. Pretty good combo right there and it was damn tasty.   Tater tots and french fries with lotsa dipping sauces. It's really sort of heavenly.   Beer list is extensive and sure to make anyone happy.   The second best part of the Happy Dog offerings would be the live music and dj's. Last night was so much fun with DJ Kishka. I brought a friend of mine who is really into polka and she made me dance with her. I never thought I'd be doing that kind of thing at the freakin' Happy Dog. It was totally fun. I apologize to the nice lady whose foot that I stepped on. I can't polka for shit.   The surroundings are pretty sweet, too. There's an Elvis lamp. 1,000 cool points for that alone.   I don't understand how anyone could not like this place. If you're one of those people, dude, you're a square."}
{"text":"I rave about Happy Dog to everyone I know! In fact, I convinced my entire office into going for lunch here. Everyone enjoyed and I got to see in action 8 different dogs, 4 different fries, and 2 different tots.   So in my opinion a bar that only serves dogs, tots, and fries is good. But when they tell me I can add any and all of 50+ toppings I just about double-over with joy.   Service is good. Beer selection is perfect for anyone's tastes. And Live Music on weekends to boot!  Go. If you've never gone, then just go. And if you have gone, then go again... I'll meet you there in a heart-beat."}
{"text":"I would like to congratulate the owners of Happy Dog for finding great new buns. They are soggy no more. They have also made a few other changes to the condiments and toppings so that was fun too.   And I would like to congratulate myself for ordering a hot dog and not being disappointed with my selection. I got baked beans, bacon, coleslaw, tomatoes, house made ketchup, and saffron aioli. Two thumbs way up!"}
{"text":"Apparently the staff here doesn't like people in their establishment. I work management in the service industry and would never allow these attitudes in my staff. Super inappropriate. Band choice was great, but both encounters from the bar staff and front of house door guys was unpleasant. As if they don't want any customers to come there. Was super rude to me. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"My first experience at Happy Dog was not just just an ordinary experience, it was a Polka Happy Hour experience! I walked into a very busy restaurant with a warm welcome over the microphone to the 'pretty ladies in pink'.  And the Polka music played all night!   Luckily a friend of mine was there first so he snagged us a spot at the bar so we each had our own stool which was perfect.  We were promptly served and asked what we wanted to drink, and from then on my glass was never empty - unless I chose for it to be!   My friend explained to me that I just take the piece of paper and fill out what I want.  A lot of times in these instances I get very overwhelmed and either end up putting too much stuff on top or not enough, but when my dog came I was EXTREMELY satisfied and will probably never change my order.   I topped mine with, onions, hot sauce, nacho cheese and a fried egg and I felt like I had went to heaven.  It was definitely an eat it with a fork and a knife kind of hot dog, but I wouldn't have had it any other way.    A friend and I shared the tatter tots and several dipping sauces (which may have been my favorite part that I could have as many as I wanted).  I am not the biggest tatter tot fan, so I think I should of went with fries instead but they were good.  One thing I would not recommend would be their house ketchup - it is not good and will ruin anything you put it on.  Their 'special sauce' is a keeper though.   If you plan to attend for Polka Happy Hour, expect a wait or to be holding your dog while you eat it.    I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Happy Dog is the best. They offer not only a great selection of toppings, but they also ave great vegan/vegetarian and gluten-free options! The vegan sausage in particular is fantastic. Prices are great, staff is friendly and helpful. Can get pretty busy, but as long as you're willing to sit at the bar, it's rare to have to wait for a table. Gone with groups here before and it's generally great, the only issue is possibly needing to split up if you're not cool with that."}
{"text":"Ashamed I've driven past this a million times before experiencing the best dig I've had ever!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome from start to finish. Drink ~ peanut butter porter (good stuff)  2 dogs (1) hot fries, spaghetti o's, house sloppy joe mix, jerk mustard (2) vodka kraut, habanero relish, pickle spear, garlic....something ball park mustard. We travel a lot for our kid's soccer and this is my favorite spot yet. Just go!! Cheers"}
{"text":"Holey Moley! I can't believe I waited this long to try this place. Their hot dog concept is a really smart idea. Choose any toppings on their list which is more than twenty, all very interesting ones. I found vegetable chow mein, peanut butter, and they even have siracha sauce. If you're Asian, you know what siracha sauce is. So anyhow, I ordered their recommended weiner combos from Michael Symon. Gourmet hot dog with alien relish, siracha suace with homemade peanut butter. OMG!!! This was soooooo good. I think I could've ate another one if I wanted to. For only $5, it's a  really good deal.   In addition, they also have a nice selection of draft beers. Guiness, Left hand milk stout to name a couple, I like this place already. I went with a friend of mine and it's a really chill place. Sit yourselves at the bar and order by using one of those sushi look-alike sheets. They had the Browns and Packers game on too so definitely a great place to grab something small to eat and watch the game. It's by Gordon Square and across from Spice so definitely a great place to bring a group of friends with you."}
{"text":"Bar, live (and loud) band, and unlimited toppings on a hot dog. This was my first experience in Cleveland but I got the feeling that this venue is part of what defines Cleveland.  We came in for a hot dog at around 12:30 in the morning and in all honesty I expected a hot dog stand. Instead we saw a bar at the corner of the street with a few people standing outside just hanging out. Right when we entered there was a live band playing probably five feet from us and I seriously thought we were in the wrong place.  The band was good, albeit a bit loud for my old ears.  The best part though has got to be the hot dogs. We sat at the bar and was given a sheet with probably 50 different toppings to choose from. The bartender said we could choose as many toppings and it will be $6. There were literally dozens of choices but the fried egg caught my eye.  The dog itself was good but I think it was the concept that was the best and most unique part of the experience.  We left with stomachs full and ears ringing for the rest of the night. Thanks Happy Dog!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent service! Love this location much more than the other one! Don't be afraid to add on many toppings as they all somehow seem to come together! I absolutely love their veggie dogs here with bacon, Carmelites onions, cream Cheese, and fruit loops!"}
{"text":"This place is KING. If you're in the mood to pig out on awesome food, the Happy Dog is for you. Literally the only things they have to eat are hot dogs, taters, fries, and toppings and sauces. Loads of them too. From mushrooms, bacon and Brie to fruit loops and peanut butter, the Happy Dog's menu has you covered to chow down for less than $20 (a dog is $6 and taters/fries are $3.50). I loved how fresh and homemade the toppings tasted, and combined with the great local beers they have on tap and awesome service, it's gonna be hard to find a better hot dog in the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this is not a review about the food. I have never come to this place and been like \"Meh, the food is ok... Eh.\" This is about the service I received.  Me and 4 other people from my cast got there are about 3:30PM after our show. We got a booth and were sitting there a while for a few minutes. We assumed it was because it was a little busy (I've seen it busier). We noticed that most of the people around us had already ordered so we figured things would get moving soon.   When our server finally came to our table she asked us if we wanted water, we said 'yes'. She left and it was a while before she came back, we were done with our order slips by then. She then asked if we were going to want separate checks when we said yes, she sighed kind of rolled her eyes and then said that she would prefer us to go and order at the bar and start a tab instead of taking our orders at the table since that would be easier/faster since it was so busy... we were a little taken a back as a table of actors, there were more than a few former and current servers at the table and that didn't really make sense to us. The bar was full and unless they have the most outdated POS system, it isn't that time consuming/hard to split checks, especially since we weren't getting a lot of stuff.   It took almost 10 minutes for the 5 of us to order at the bar and we felt bad because we were crowding some of the customers sitting there because there wasn't much space for us to order.   Of course since they were separate tabs all of our food came out at different times. It took about 15-20 minutes for our food to come out once the first item came out and then she only came by once during the hour we were there to see if we wanted anymore water. When she did she refilled the water for everyone but me, and when I tried to wave her down she basically ignored me.   I've had bad service before but this was burgeoning on rude, I definitely will be back but another experience like this might have me rethinking returning."}
{"text":"This place has a really cool idea of just putting whatever you want on hot dogs! They even have peanut butter and cocoa puffs, along with a bunch of other delicious items. I actually really enjoyed all the hot dogs I created and the atmosphere was really chill and the waitress was nice and gave good service. Definitely recommend this place if you like hot dogs or if you just like trying cool new foods."}
{"text":"Best hot dog offerings in Ctown with most original condiments.  The buns are fresh and both styles of dogs are delicious.  You won't believe all the variations to build a one of a kind dog."}
{"text":"I really don't understand how anyone could not like this place. It's fun and tasty. Beer list is great, hot dog options awesome and the vibe is laid back.  Will be back."}
{"text":"ok, I have discovered the joy of the breakfast dog......I'm a huge fan of brinner and my ability to smear my dog with peanut butter, spanish onions, mole sauce and to top it all off with an egg makes me extremely happy!!"}
{"text":"This place is so chill - trapezoid bar in the center of a small dance hall-dive bar, serving up big hot dogs, burgers and brilliant baskets of tots made to your own custom specifications across varying categories of toppings and sauces. Tastiness may vary according to your own culinary imagination and knowledge of what tastes good with what, but Happy Dog does have some pre-selected combinations for those who just want to drink beer, eat good food, and let down their mental load. Awesome place. I could easily imagine hanging out there all weekend."}
{"text":"Had to check this place out for our day spent in Cleveland! It's a simple no frills establishment, dogs and tots. As others have said you build your own dog and there are so many toppings to chose from.   The three of us each ordered a dog. Of our creations the pimento Mac and cheese with bacon, grilled onions and fry sauce was the favorite. We enjoyed the everything cream cheese on our second dog that also included bacon, siracha sauce, grilled onions and hot fries for a little crunch. For us our chorizo chili dog was disappointing, chili was too sweet for my preference. The dogs themselves are nothing special just an ordinary steamed hotdog. Tots were just okay we added shredded cheese and were dissapointed it was not melted over top but trying all the sauces with them was fun!  All in all its a cool local spot to check out. Being from Dayton, I'm a huge Zombie Dog fan and this place didn't top them. Still the options are endless and prices reasonable for a quick bite!"}
{"text":"I would give Happy Dog 5 stars if the place was spruced up a bit. I love their food and variety, but the inside just doesn't do it for me. There isn't enough seating when it is super packed and I think they would do a heck of a lot better with it in a bigger space. I was offered to get seated quickly in the basement, so I went down there and immediately turned around to go back up the steps due to the dungeon like feel.  That being said, the tots are great, the wieners with all the topping options are spectacular, and the price is definitely right. I will go back the next time I am craving a hot dog and some greasy food but if I go on a weekend, I will be sure  to eat a snack before coming and be ready to fight with a fellow waiting patron for a table that is getting ready to leave!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times. Food is always good.   Recent trip in my hot dog buns were stale and so were the Andy Capps hot fries I had on top. Come on guys!!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed our food, we ordered hot dogs and tots.  It was delicious.  Only disappointment is that we ordered a hot dog for our son who is 3, with no bun or toppings and it was still $6.  Like literally a plain/naked hot dog.  Seems like it might be reasonable to have a kids option, when you know they aren't going to utilize the \"all you can top it with\" option.  Like maybe a plain dog for $3 or something?  A topped hot dog is definitely worth $6... a plain hot dog is definitely not.  Still, the food was good and worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great atmosphere, staff, drinks and fries. The dogs are good, but every time I get one, the bun is so soggy it breaks open on the bottom. The fries, staff, love music and drinks keep me coming back."}
{"text":"I'm glad I live  down the street! love the food here, the variety is endless and the fact that they have options for the dog itself is great. Being a vegan, you can only hope for the best of some restaurants, as some places aren't as veg friendly as others. Happy dog does not disappoint.  The drink selection is also varied and delicious. And, I'm a fan of any place with quality tater tots!   My only critique is how busy they get on nights with live music (which is not as great as it could be.) There is no where to sit and they don't seem to address this. If you want to watch the show, get there early. If not, just go on another night."}
{"text":"Another place you have to attend if visiting Cleveland.  Fun place with great beers, a \"couple\" toppings for their hot dogs."}
{"text":"Nothin' fancy about the Happy Dog and that's just why I like it.  The neighborhood is a bit rough but once inside you'll never know you're far from home. This place has two specialties - draught beer and hot dogs. The selection for both is extensive, especially the hot dog toppings. You check off what you want on your hot dog, give it to the waitress, and 5 minutes later there's your dog.   We weren't sure what we wanted so we went with the \"Suggested Combinations\" . I ordered the Chicago-style toppings (relish, onions, mustard, pickle). Yum! My husband got a chili dog. Even yummier! At $5 per dog no matter how many toppings, it's a good deal. We'll be back!@"}
{"text":"Happy Dog makes me happy. How can you not like a place that serves beef hotdogs with your choice of fifty toppings. HELLS YES FIFTY! Like where do they even do that at. Make no mistake Happy Dog is a straight up dive bar so don't worry about coming dressed to impress. Its definitely not that type of place. In addition to the hot dogs which did I mention they are $5 - no matter how many crazy insane toppings you put on them. But I digress, they also have tater tots. Who doesn't like tater tots?!?!? Maybe  Satan I'm not sure. But they have a number of homemade sauces to dip those things in so you can't go wrong there either. They have a fair amount of beers but plenty for a hot dog place. They also have quiz night on Tuesday (last I heard) and feature bands throughout the week. I typically do not go on band nights. If you are looking for cheap eats and a fun atmosphere check them out."}
{"text":"Hot dog was cold. The topping were all cold. Some are explainable. I don't want warm cheese. But cold bacon kinda stunk. Dog was loaded. First bite was bread. Hot dog broke the bun immediately. Overall I can honestly say that I'd rather a hot Dairy Queen hotdog than a cold loaded $7 dog. I was really excited to come here too. Very disappointed. Good luck."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, full bar, hot dog combinations go from wierd to wonderful, not at all pretentious. A true Cleveland original. Often crowded, especially during frequent live music."}
{"text":"I waltzed into Happy Dog with the highest expectations, largely on account of my friend who would not shut up about it. Well, guess what: he was right.   For $5, the same price as a naked Tribe hot dog, you can get a hot dog and over 50 different toppings. That's right. FIFTY. These toppings change periodically. I ordered \"the works.\"  Just Kidding; actually, I ordered Siracha, Thai chile and garlic sauce, a pickle spear (gotta order the pickle spear), Yuengling-flavored sauerkraut, and garlicky escarole. The bun quivered under the weight of the all-beef weenie and toppings, but my oh my! Party in my mouth, fire in my mouth. A vegan dog is also available for those who took An Omnivore's Dilemma too seriously.  Obviously, I also ordered the tator tots, squeezing my wallet dry at a hefty $3. This comes with a choice of however many sauces you want. The secret French Fry sauce is so delicious that I'd probably go on Fear Factor if the winning prize was the French Fry Sauce Super Secret Recipe. The house made Ketchup is not shabby, but for $3, you might as well sample the housemade sauces. I didn't care for the Red Chile and Chocolate Mole sauce, and was scolded for \"not know what I'm talking about.\" Haters.  The beer selection consists of local beers and old man beers to compliment your fancy schmancy dog. Order a couple, then head downstairs to test your mad skills at Pinball. Look for my record, it's probably second from the last. Happy Dog also has a shuffleboard, but for some reason we couldn't use it when we were there. Drats! Next time."}
{"text":"A good hot dog can be a revelation - a good hot dog with YOUR choice of 50 toppings can become a religion.   Happy Dog blends this elevated hot dog experience with the dark, somewhat run-down local band bar atmosphere that might make your shiny diner dog loving friends a little nervous. Tell them to look past the revolving cast of artistically tattooed severs - many of them wearing coats like they're coming in from a smoke break - who often overlap with the same questions ... And focus on creating THEIR perfect dog. Then add the crispiest, crunchiest tots and a beer - or Frostie Root Beer served in the bottle - and the whole place is bathed in the glow of favorite foods done right.  With 50 ingredients to choose from, for Dog 1 I went for Ballpark Mustard, Bacon Balsamic Marmalade, Guiness Sauerkraut and French's Fried Onions ... it was smokey, tangy fantasticness. Dog 2 was a New Englander - Ballpark Mustard, Bourbon Baked Beans, Spanish Onion and Dill Pickle Spear - smooth and rich with the bite of the onions & pickle. I cannot begin to describe everything my husband put on his dogs - but he was a happy man!  If you are a hot dog fan, Happy Dog will take your love places you have never imagined. With the tens of thousands of combinations I can create with their menu, I'll be testing many more Happy Dogs in my future."}
{"text":"Polka Happy Hour, people!  On some Fridays, DJ Kishka spins traditional polkas like there's no tomorrow. Freakin' genius! This was the most fun I've had at a bar in a long time.   A place called the Happy Dog that serves dogs... how apropos. I'm a big fan of toppings and dipping sauces. I love building my own (sometimes scary) hotdog masterpiece. I haven't really had a topping or sauce I didn't like. They are all great. And tots rule.  The beer selection is amazing. If you're feeling particularly hipsterish, you can get your Genny Cream on draft. But be prepared for a massive headache the next day.  Ice cubes and beer!"}
{"text":"Great hot dogs ^^^ perfect tater tot's * I stopped in for lunch*** vegan dogs are the bomb :) fantastic quality and amazing sauces and dips . ok so they took over an old 1960's bar which is cool, but unfortunately didn't put a much into the place. The drop ceiling looks like it's ready to cave-in...I love gritty+ grunge but it's seriously like having an awesome hotdog in a run down \"Elks club\". It would be nice if they put a little more into the atmosphere."}
{"text":"yeah i love happy dog. the dog is ok. actually, being vegetarian, get the vegan dog, with lots of non-vegan things. like mac and cheese. i love mac and cheese. alien relish (it's neon green for some reason). i love dive bars and this is a dive bar. i asked for jameson once. neat. yeah it was a glass of delicious liquid. their bloody mary's are pretty good too. they have this awesome program called the classical revolution, where you get to watch a few hours of live classical music performed by very talented musicians. my friends run it. it's awesome and it's on one tuesday a month. they also have a great draft selection, and everyone is super nice. i heard one of the pinball machine is the best pinball machine like under the sun. maybe i'll try next time. also it's nice that they have a parking lot."}
{"text":"If you like hot dogs and tots then you'll love this place!  It's not haute cuisine but really good hot dogs with endless toppings.  You have to get a plethora of dipping sauces to share with your tots.  We came during a Polka Happy Hour with DJ Kishka unknowingly and it turned out to be a blast.  Luckily we snagged seats at the bar before the place filled up to the brim with jovial Polish Clevelanders."}
{"text":"Like hot dogs? GO HERE. Don't like hot dogs? GO HERE. Want one of the best experiences of your life? DEFINITELY GO HERE.  On business in Cleveland, a friend took me to Happy Dog and I had no idea what to expect. Pulling up, the place is very unassuming but once you step foot inside, you are overwhelmed by a place with almost too much character to handle (in a good way). This place is pretty hipster, but as a non-hipster I felt like I fit in just fine. I was fortunate enough to visit Happy Dog during \"Polka Happy Hour\" where I was delighted by the first (and probably only) Polka DJ I have ever heard. Such a fun atmosphere and I can only imagine it gets better as the night goes on.  Enough about how cool this place is, let me talk about the food. With a build-your-own, checklist style menu you get the chance to be invested in your meal. Everyone starts with a hot dog but after that, your possibilities are really endless. With all sorts of meats, cheeses, and other toppings (as normal as bacon or chilli and as obscure as fruit loops or spaghettios) you can create a culinary masterpiece. For me, I went with bacon, mac n cheese, sauteed onions, garlic aoli and siracha. I was super impressed and very satisfied. Pair that with the tater tots, also topped with anything you'd like, and all sorts of beer options, there is not much negative to say about Happy Dog. OH and did I mention the hot dogs, with anything you want on top, are only $5??! Such a steal.  Basically, if you want to have the time of your life in Cleveland, make sure to hit up Happy Dog."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for a good vegetarian hot dog, so when I found out that Happy Dog not only had veggie dogs but that they also used my favorite Field Roast sausages I was sold! The food is delicious. The tots are always crunchy on the outside and just the right amount of tender on the inside. Not worth it to add cheese to them though, as they don't melt the cheese. It's just cold shredded cheese on top and is actually kinda gross. The list of toppings is A+ and their sauces are amazing! My only complaint with the sauces is that they don't come labeled and every waiter we've had never knows what is what and I never get the sauces I chose served to me. NOt a big deal since they're all delicious, but I would like to know what is what so I can order it again! Not a fan of the house made ketchup, but I love the sweet chili sauce! My only beef with their list of toppings and sauces is that I wish they would add a ranch dressing to their menu! Also, the veggie chili is bangin'!!"}
{"text":"So glad they are now open for lunch.  Were they not before?  Got a vegan dog and a normal dog.  There are a trillion toppings and they have a special menu so you can figure out what topping gs are vegan, gluten free...  takes the awkward \"what's in this\" conversation out of the equation.   Two beers, two dogs and a basket of tots, we were stuffed.  It was delicious.  And we didn't go broke.  Yummmmm."}
{"text":"I dig the Happy Dog and it's downstairs brother, Under Dog.  Happy Dog is a nice dive with tasty dogs that aren't expensive.  The beers are good and the bartenders are cool/friendly.  Sometimes they have live music, which is also fun.  Oh, and the $5 hot dogs with unlimited toppings is a huge plus.  I'm not talking about the junk hot dogs you get at dollar dog night Indian's games.  Hell, I'm not talking about the hot dogs you get at any Indians game.  These are big and plump fatties made with all beef--the kind that have some texture and actually taste good.  And the toppings menu is long and varied with awesome ingredients. One $5 dog with a slew of amazing toppings is more than enough for dinner... I promise.  While it looks a  bit like a hipster-focused dive at times, don't let that deter you.  It's not some exclusive place meant to cater to only the most stereotypical of hipsters.  Everyone is welcome and that's part of the fun.  I've seen families in the afternoons, groups of women in their 60's in the evenings, average Joes and Janes, metal heads, punk rockers, front runners, real hipsters and their less hardcore snappy-dresser-only counterparts, and all sorts of people from all sorts of walks of life.    The Under Dog in the downstairs is also great--it's got a small bar, some old arcade games, and a sweet shuffle board table.  It reminds me of the drinking man's bars my dad would take me to as a child while he engaged int he regular maintenance of his alcoholism.  No, it's not a bad memory.  I know these sorts of places as being friendly and welcoming.  The kind of joint where you focus on your drink and the casual conversation of a few strangers you just met.  It's a fun thing."}
{"text":"I never would have thought hotdogs would go so well with such diverse ingredients, but I have to admit I am impressed. I try to put 8-10 toppings on my dog, although one day I just might ask for all 50. The tater tots are really good here too, and the garlic aioli sauce is TO DIE FOR! I am gonna have to start making my own! I am really digging the Peanut Buttercup Porter they have there, absolutely delicous."}
{"text":"First off a disclaimer. I really dislike hot dogs. They usually are not my thing. But Happy Dog showed me the light.   The hot dogs are big and juicy and there are literally as many toppings as you could ever want. Let's start with the sauces. They have mustards ranging from your standard yellow to black truffle honey mustard (which is mana sent from heaven for this chick). The barbecue sauce is smoky spicy and great on the tater tots. Not to mention the mole, chimichurri, catsup, and ginger currant chutney. The more substantial toppings range from chorizo chili to chunky peanut butter. The alien relish was a little disconcerting as it was grass green but the taste made up for any color aversiions. The sauerkraut is made with Yuengling and is still crunchy when served. May I recommend a dog with sauerkraut, ballpark mustard, sauteed onions, cheddar cheese and a pickle spear and some tater tots.   ZOMG the tater tots are heavenly puffs off fried potatoey goodness. Get them dusted with the barbecue dust you won't be disappointed. On top of their fried potatpey goodness there is a plethora of toppings and sauces you can choose to go with them.   Now what more can I say to convince you to go. Great neighborhood, awesome food, oh yeah beer. Domestics, draught, craft or imported they have a great selection and knowledgable staff. They carry a lot of local brews you usually don't see. Including selections from Fathead's and Willoughby Brewing. The list changes so often I won't even try to suggest a brew.   And last and almost least there is the price. Dogs are 5 bucks. flat. No matter if you get chorizo chili and sloppy joe and 4 cheeses or just some mustard. Yes please.    Go. Right now. Do Not pass go do not collect 200 dollars just go to the Happy dog. You will be a happy dog after."}
{"text":"Great restaurant! We got 2 hot dogs and tater tot. Everything was very good.  I really like the Alabama Sauce.  Came for Happy hour in July and hot dogs were half off.  I can't believe how much you can get for $5!"}
{"text":"don't overdo it on the toppings  tots are a must  bacon and cream cheese - great combo  booming beer selection  overdo it on the dipping sauces  a little for a lot"}
{"text":"One of my first stops when I moved to Cleveland in 2013, I instantly fell in love with this place on my first visit. Greeted by a swarm of young folks outside smoking cigarettes upon entry to a local live indie rock band playing music 6 feet from the front door. I was slapped in the face with it's awesomeness the second I walked in, only to one-up itself with the food menu consisting of hotdogs or tater-tots with unlimited free toppings. With this many choices, the possibilities of combinations are endless and usually ends up some form of meat-soup in a hotdog bun bowl. I'll admit some of my concoctions here were painful in my stomach later in the night, yet it could have been the booze since you can get Black Label's for a few bucks which seems to be the go-to for the Happy Dog crowd. It's safe to say I've ordered everything on the menu here, including the t-shirt, and everything is great, however I personally prefer the veggie-dog. Great people, great food, cheap drinks, pinball machines and live music - could you possibly ask for more?"}
{"text":"The happy dog is my \"neighborhood/go-to\" bar, and Im currently living in the burbs.  The atmosphere reminds me of my days partying in Parma basements, I absolutely love the diverse crowd that patronizes this business.  The wait staff is always attentive and kind.  Three cheers!"}
{"text":"I am not a fan of hotdogs, I hadn't eaten them in years until I came to Happy Dog. Well, everything changed for me right then and there. These are some of the best hotdogs I've ever had! The dog itself tasted amazing, juicy and flavorful, and you could tell that it wasn't some prepackaged mystery meat. The fact that for $6 you can get one of these with anything you want on it is phenomenal. Their polenta mac and cheese is delicious, and is fantastic on top of their hotdogs, alone with bacon and their cremini mushrooms! Also, their tots are bomb, get a giant basket of them.   Go here. Grab a dog, a beer, some tots and enjoy your night."}
{"text":"I. Don't Get. It. That about sums up my two experiences at Happy Dog. It's a gimmick. The place basically serves two things, tater tots and hot dogs, with the rest of the menu a mishmash of pantry items and sauces that you can then throw on top of said tater tots and hot dogs. It's that simple. Oh, yeah, and it's pretty damn cheap. That, in a worn down, old VFW post nutshell, is exactly what Happy Dog is, my friends.  Step 1: Walk in and seat yourself. Don't worry about being greeted by anyone, because it won't happen. There's not even one of those \"Seat Yourself\" signs. I guess you're just supposed to wander around looking like a dipshit until one of the employees takes pity on you and eventually comes over to inform you that \"you can sit anywhere\".  Step 2: Pick fries or tots. Pick beef or veggie hot dog. Choose toppings. It's not rocket science but the two times we've been there the server had to ask if we knew how it worked. Really? Like I can't figure out what the little check box lists and golf course pencils are for? That without your gentle guidance I might end up wandering around the floor, drooling and babbling incoherently about aliens and my tin foil hat? C'mon. You've got three menu items and a bunch of toppings. I think I'll be OK.  Step 3: Lower your expectations. Complacent service has been elevated to an artform at Happy Dog. The servers we had during both of our visits had managed the perfect combination of \"I won't look directly at you\" service and \"I know I work here but I don't like you or your face\" attitude. It's not really unfriendly it's just, well, vacant and unpleasant. Imagine if April Ludgate from Parks and Rec got a job there and was told to \"be nice\" to the customers. During one visit my wife asked for a glass of ice to go with her orange pop. It never happened.  Step 4: Play \"find the beer we actually have\" bingo. Shitty hipster beers on your beer menu isn't a good thing. I don't give a rat's ass that you serve Schlitz or Blatz or whateverthehellelse you think your patrons want to spend $2.50 on to drink ironically while contemplating the demise of the middle class and how \"last year\" the recent (insert painfully average unknown band name here) album is.   Both times I was here I randomly selected beers from the menu and both times they were out of several of the beers I wanted. I wouldn't be surprised if the list was just for show and that in the basement all they had was a sixer of Great Lakes Dortmunder next to a case of Miller High Life all hinging on the hopes that nobody would ever order any of the other 60 beers on the list. And don't bring me a craft beer without a glass and then appear annoyed when I ask you for one.  Step 5: Respect the Food Guy's boundaries. Don't ask the guy that brings your food to the table for anything that's not specifically food-related. Seriously, don't do it. During our last visit when he asked us if there was anything else he could get us I inquired about the aforementioned glass of ice for my wife. He simply replied, laughing \"I'm just the food guy\" and walked away.  Step 6: Enjoy the delightfully average food. Don't be tempted by the seemingly endless selection of toppings. Besides, 80% of the things on their list are items you'd never consider putting on a hot dog in the outside world, and there's a reason for that. Just don't. If you get Fruit Loops, alien relish, pork and beans and vodka sauerkraut you will regret it. I'm sure if they added monkey turds, used band-aids and belly button lint someone would claim it a \"must try\".  Because I felt I had to, I opted for the Michael Symon's favorite -alien green relish, peanut butter, sriracha hot sauce. In keeping with the theme of this review, I didn't get it. The relish turned the bun into a sopping, wet mess. The tater tots are good, sure, but anyone with an oven and Oreida can pull that off, and the dogs are good but nothing special. The Kobe beef dog at Beer Engine puts them to shame.  Step 7: Enjoy the show. I'm not talking about live music, either. God knows a live music event at this place is spelled NIHL, I'm talking about the other customers. They're the best thing about coming here. White guy with cornrows wearing a sleeveless Slayer t-shirt, Chick at the bar with her thong out a full 4 inches over her waistband. Clearly uncomfortable Ethnic family that apparently wandered in by mistake but didn't want to bring shame upon their houses by leaving. The people-watching is worth the price of admission.  I know what you're thinking. After reading this review why the hell would I ever wanna go to Happy Dog? Well, my friends, don't let my hyper-realistic account dissuade you from trying it on for size. It's a gimmick, definitely. It's got that grandpa's basement feel to it. Friendliness? Not so much They do have live music and trivia though, not that I'll ever experience those. Maybe it's your thing. If so, we probably wouldn't get along anyway."}
{"text":"Hot dogs here are amazing. You can be super creative with them! I like sloppy joe on mine. Beer selection is decent and live bands are good. Only thing keeping it from 5 stars is the nasty soap they have in the bathroom. I think it is floor cleaner. I'm serious that is not soap."}
{"text":"Happy Dog is truly a corner dive bar in all sense - from its corner store front location to a dark motif interior complete with wrap around bar and a performance stage. What truly drew us to Happy Dog, is it's reputation for serving up Hot Dogs with up to 50 types of toppings ( all included in the price ) as well as a very diverse list of beer - one of them a recent favorite of mine - Magic Hat number 9.  The ordering consists of picking your choice of beer or mixed drink, then filling out a bubble sheet - nope not for a test. You pick the regular hot dog or veggie dog, pick any of the included 50 toppings - they will give you all 50 if you wanted to be crazy, pick a side of fries or Spicy tots, dipping sauce. We decided to try a veggie dog and a regular dog. The bar tender was absolutely right that their veggie dogs are awesome. The toppings ranging from the traditional affairs to sweet ( jam ) to spicy mole, Caribbean slaw or habanero sauce, provide something for almost all taste buds. The spicy tots provide a creative spin on these over-looked side dish. For the non hot dog lovers or variety they also offer chili on their menu both as a standalone item or as one of the toppings.  There are side bar tables that are placed on one end of the wrap around bar proving some darker cozy corners as well as booths to larger open tables providing dining space for larger groups on the other side of the bar. The serving staff are bar tenders themselves. During our visit I noticed at least three bartenders manning the bar as well as the tables. I found the staff to be very helpful in educating us about their ordering process as well as with recommendations. Happy Dog keeps their food menu simple yet something to crave for again and again. There is parking in a poorly kept parking space with only about 10 spaces, across the street.  However there is ample parking on the side streets."}
{"text":"Loves the flavor, but it was messy to the point of unedible even with fork and knife. Flavor still makes it worth it but messiness brings it down a star"}
{"text":"Wow, not being a hot dog eater, I don't know what to say other than : it's the 21st Century and modernizing the HVAC would probably be a good idea."}
{"text":"So I wasn't quite sure what to expect from a \"hot dog\" place but I was actually pleasantly surprised. The ordering process was very simple and straight forward. Many options for trimmings but not a lot of options outside of that.   The all beef dog was delicious. I ordered it without a bun, pretty flexible in that regard. The veggie dog that I tried was pretty tasty as well. I would have given this place a 5 if it had more options beyond a hot dog and hot dog trimmings. But for what it is, it's a pretty cool spot and a nice place to grab a bite or two.   Check it out!"}
{"text":"I thought this place was cool. You can put just about anything imaginable on a hot dog here. It's a little pricey considering these are hot dogs, but I'm sure your paying for the experience. The neighborhood that this is located in is not the greatest, but the food and experience is great."}
{"text":"So it's 2am, you're hungry, and liquored up...Where to go? Happy dog it is!  I've been here on many occasions that dealt with the scenario above. But don't get me wrong, it's always the happy choice! I don't know if it's knowing that you can get a delicious hot dog creation 2 in the morning or you're just happy to have some food in your stomach after a night of drinking; but this place is DAMNED good!   So you start off by taking a Happy Dog scantron sheet and fill in the circles (yes I order like I'm taking the SATs) with any of the 50 toppings you want on your $5 hot dog (I suggest getting the sunny side up fired egg). If it's your first time here, you might want to fill in as many circles as you can, but don't over do it, otherwise you'll be left with a messy gulp on top of your dog with confusing flavors! You then flip the scantron over and definitely fill in the circle that says \"Tatter Tots\", trust me you want this. Don't forget to pick your sauces; beware that the Monocho's habanero sauce is pretty damn spicy.   Once your creation arrives (along with your tots), dig in and enjoy it with fork and knife! If it doesn't taste good, blame yourself for being too greedy on the toppings and cut back next time!  Oh yeah, there's a great selection of beer as well. From local brews to micro brews all over the country. I usually wash down the dog with a glass of LH milk stout :)"}
{"text":"Hot dogs are my favorite food. Yes, out of everything in the world, nothing quite does it for me like a delicious old-fashioned hot dog. So naturally Happy Dog would be the ultimate place for me. Not only do I drool over even the possibility of going to Happy Dog, I very often dream about it.  Believe it or not, but I even went to Happy Dog for my college graduation \"celebratory dinner\" back in May. Our outfits may have been a tad overkill, but that didn't stop us from stuffing our faces with delicious hot dogs."}
{"text":"There tater tots are so fun, crispy perfection. And I was allowed to put nacho cheese, chimichurri and an egg over medium on top without judgment, my kind of place! The bar itself it awesome, old and has great personality...staff was nice and very quick. Good beer selection and great topping selection for you dog...tots were my favorite part."}
{"text":"I like the concept. But, I did not enjoy Happy Dog. I got a chorizo chili and cheddar hot dog which was ok. I tasted a sloppy joe bacon hot dog and I did not like it. Tater tots with cheddar were mushy. Coke was watered down and melted the ice almost immediately. TVs, music, and interior had a 1960s-1970s drug vibe which I did not like. Prices are fair $6 and its cool you can get froot loops or spaghetti o's and the secret sauce is ok, service good, casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place is really cool! It was my first day in CLE and I was invited by a group that I have been working with on some event business out here. They asked if I like hot dogs..I thought, who doesn't? I wasn't really sure what to think but this is a total do your own dog kind of place. There are a ton of selections for toppings, and if you are feeling overwhelmed, they provide you with a list of house suggested combos.  They also offer a vegan dog, which I thought was such a cool addition. The tots were crispy and hot and the portion was enormous. I tried a couple sauces, the chipotle ketchup, top secret house sauce and garlic aioli and they were all delicious. Also, the chimichuri sauce was super fantastic! If you are in CLE, def try this spot."}
{"text":"If you've ever seen Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives this place would be a Guy Fieri dream! It was a typical dive bar serving dogs and fries (or tots) with an astounding 50 topping selection. For the dogs, you pay one price and pile on as many toppings as you want. The fries and tots did have a few items available for an extra cost. For a Saturday afternoon, between lunch and dinner, I was surprised at how many people were there. They have a great beer selection and the NCAA basketball games were on - great place to hang out. Try the fries topped with the churizo chili and cheddar cheese - super yum!"}
{"text":"I love hot dogs.  I especially love hot dog diners.  This place is so cool.  I went on a Saturday afternoon for lunch.  There was a good crowd of people.  The best part of the experience is deciding what toppings to get on your dog, and this is NOT an easy decision.  I decided to go big and weird - - I topped my dog with a fried egg.  It sounds disgusting, but don't knock it until you try it, cause it was delicious!  I definitely suggest you stop by this place if you are in Cleveland, cause it is fun and unique."}
{"text":"A magical place where a confluence of choice brews on tap, an array of topped hotdogs, and a hip vibe that can't be beat. I give Happy Dog props for having an extensive madlibs of delicious and exotic toppings. All daring dog downers can quest to find the topping combo that compliments their taste buds."}
{"text":"There was a lot of hype over this place when it opened. The food was just horrible. The chili looked and smelled like it was canned. French fries were soggy and service was nothing to talk about."}
{"text":"This place is so unique. What I love about it, is you can decide what you want on your hot dog (or vegan dog) by checking off items on a list. It has almost everything you can think of putting on meat, even fruit loops. I had the refried beans, egg, and curry peanut butter. It was an explosion of flavor. I recommend this place to anyone looking for a casual dining experience."}
{"text":"I was visiting Cleveland and searching for a good food to eat and found this place and what a experience ! .  I tried the vegan hot dog and oh boy !! Was it delicious !.the best dog you will ever have .  The place has no pretense ."}
{"text":"Divey, dog goodness.   With the live music, the dive bar atmosphere, and all the beer how can you go wrong? We actually came here for a corporate event for work to show some of the new interns some local Cleveland hotspots. It is a perfect example of what the Cleveland culinary scene is. Comforting non-pretentious and downright fun.   I got the tots with their special house sauce and a dog with some greens and some other spicier toppings. My only word of warning is go easy on all the toppings. Think balance instead of just taking everything that you like. It won't end well. Keep it simple and you'll be impressed.   If anyone hasn't been here I would highly recommend it. It is a fun cool little place, almost everyone will enjoy as long as they go knowing that at the end of the day it's just hotdogs!"}
{"text":"Happy Dog is Cleveland's answer to Chicago's Hot Doug's. One thing- hot dogs, done up in thousands of different combinations with various toppings, condiments and sauces, from the everyday to the exotic.   My first time here, I went with the suggested combination of Korean ingredients including cucumbers, kimchi and chili paste. My dog, was this delicious! As another reviewer mentioned, the bun became soggy and inedible very fast and normally that would be enough to shave off a star, if not two, right? In this case, not so much because the spicy, vinegary Korean toppings and the perfectly done all beef dog was one of the most sublime flavor profiles I've experienced. My wife had a dog with a Mexican mole theme and it was just as mouth wateringly tasty - with less collateral damage on the bun to boot!  The fries and tots here are both amazing - be sure to pick out some interesting sauce for those as well.   It should be no surprise the food here is so good as this is partly the brainchild of Momocho's Eric Williams.   The space is an old bar - probably looking no different than it did in 1950 and I love that kind of time capsule ambiance even with the hipster vibes."}
{"text":"Whatever you order, you must be sure they slap that sunny side up egg on your dog. I put the Brazilian Chimichurri sauce. On it and it was a delight. Tater tots were good. Didn't care too much for the house ketchup. It's more of a bar style dive than a restaurant. Disappointed by their coke because it tasted flat."}
{"text":"I didn't quite find out what the hype is about this place. That's why I went there, because quite \"frankly\" I don't like hot dogs, I just wanted to see if it was as good as everyone says. I love the build-your-own concept and all of the toppings sounded great. The hot dog just didn't taste quite right. I don't think there was anything wrong with it, but it did not taste right. I ate all of the toppings and left most of the dog and bun.  I also ordered tots, with pimento mac & cheese on top. The tots were great! Overly greasy, but that's how people like them, I guess?  The menu is self-explanatory. You pick which dog you want (all-beef or veggie), and select unlimited toppings, which include all kinds of sauces, meats, egg, veggies, pickled stuff, etc.  Same with tots or fries, you can top them with whatever you want. I loved the extra dipping sauces.  They have a great beer selection. I didn't order a drink, but they had several beers on tap too. And a huge bar.  Its kind of a hole in the wall place, but its been updated and has somewhat of a trendy feel to it.   They do have a small parking lot across the road and some street parking nearby.  The price was right. $6 for a dog, $3.50 for tots/fries, a couple extra dollars for select toppings on each."}
{"text":"Best hot dog in Cleveland. My standard is a beef hot dog with mole, bacon, habanero pickled onions and tots with ketchup, more mole, garlic aioli, and habanero sauce. A couple of PBR's or #9's and good music to round a perfect evening. The Underdog is also a cool experience, if you want a different type of atmosphere."}
{"text":"Omg why have I not been here before! This place is freaking awesome! First you would never know they had food. The place is a straight up drive bar. But once you get that menu dive bar concept goes out the door. The food here is damn good. Happy dog menu rocks you design you own hot dog. So you know what that means do what you want and they will make it no questions asked. I mean damn after some drinks this place can be dangerous and I mean that in a good way. The food is fresh and the portions are large. Mix that with good music and you have a hit! The crew and I ordered a few different dogs with different toppings to try. None disappointed that is freaking awesome. This place is must if you live or are visiting the land."}
{"text":"Love this place! Reasonable prices, good beer (and cider!) selection, and of course the hot dogs. Both the original and the veggie dog are really good.  If you get their fries, I highly recommend the chipotle hollandaise dipping sauce. So good!"}
{"text":"So good. I love the chill environment and the food. I love the ridiculous variety of hot dogs! What a creative business idea."}
{"text":"My sister insisted we go to the Happy Dog and man am I glad she did.  I am going to go on record to say I am not the biggest hot dog fan.  And at the Happy Dog the actual hot dog was not my favorite- but I knew that going in.  What I DO love is an infinite amount of topping and dipping sauces and that is exactly what the Happy Dog provided.  They have a list of over 50 toppings that you can put on your hot dog.  If that is not cool enough you turn the page over and the same options apply for your tator tots!  This of course was overwhelming but with my sisters help I prevailed.  Between our group we got tator tots with gravy, tator tots with chili and cheese and plain tator tots.  We got like 12 dipping sauces and they were all bomb.  I liked the asian chili one and the fry sauce.  We all got some form of chili/sloppy joe dog.  Our groups favorite toppings for the dogs were the hot fries and the sport peppers.  This place is a dive but dives are the most fun.  They have a great wrap around bar and an incredible beer list.  Such a bargain too!   The reason I did not give this place 5 out of 5 is because the bun is of such low quality.  I was warned about the bun by my sister but I rather pay an extra dollar for a quality bun than have one that dissolves on the way to the table.  Also the bathroom was gross.  Another complaint is out of the 50+ options jalapenos were not one of them :(  When you have chili, nacho cheese, etc you want some jalapenos with that.   Complaints aside this place is still completely awesome and delicious! Great food, great deal and dipping sauces!!!"}
{"text":"If your a vegetarian or vegan and miss your hotdogs this is the spot for you. There are so many topping options for you to include that are vegetarian friendly.   I also think the atmosphere was really relaxed and cool. The dj was spinning actual vinyl records that consisted of mostly 90's favorites."}
{"text":"Fantastic place with a cool atmosphere,  great selection of alcohol, and the best dogs you've ever created yourself!   You are given a \"fill it out yourself\" menu and get to choose from tons of different toppings that don't cost anything extra on your hot dog.   There are some combinations that are pre selected, but you are encouraged to explore and have fun building out your own dog. I was skeptical coming in here but absolutely loved it! And the server who helped me was very friendly and helpful. After about 9000 understand they have live bands set up and play, and the only potential downside you may still have to pay a cover charge.   Also be warned it doesn't open until 4:30 p.m.. I made the mistake of coming too early for lunch, and ended up walking away with my tail tucked between my legs.   That aside great spot!"}
{"text":"Just when I thought Happy Dog couldn't get better, they surprised me with awesome service on a pretty bad day.   This visit was probably the best I've had. We decided to head out for hotdogs, beers and relaxation to help us out of our funk. We greeted and chatted with, which felt great after a pretty darn awful start to my bf and I's day. Drinks served immediately, maintained throughout our visit and overall, we were just taken really, really good care of.   I went with my usual Chicago dog with Sriracha and even though they don't have poppyseed buns, the Orlando ones are delicious (and a secret shout out to CLE.) Once again, so delicious. We also put in an order of nacho cheese covered tots (don't you dare judge--like I said, it was a bad day) and our server recommended some additional dipping sauces she thought we'd enjoy--and we did! The green, chimichurri stuff and the hollandaise were both winners, and I would have never known!    I have to admit--I can't do Happy Dog when it's crammed with people and loud music. I think I'm getting a little old and crabby, because I hate not being able to calmly approach the bar to order a drink and relax... but anyways. This visit was slow, easy, relaxing and perfect. AND we hit happy hour so this tab was super-small, which also added to our mood improvement."}
{"text":"Great dive bar with amazing hot dogs with a huge selection of crazy toppings. You gotta get the tots. The hot dogs are big you will be tempted to get more then one dog, if you do bring your appetite. This place has a great selection of beer too."}
{"text":"There probably isn't much to add. This is a great kind of quirky divey bar, with an upstairs where there is music and a downstairs bar with pinball machines. You essentially eat meals served on on top of a hot dog. Traditionally, I would prefer to eat a hot dog by hand but there's a lot of creativity and deliciousness to be had here. Just to repeat what everyone else has said about the tater tots as well, they are awesome and come with a variety of creative sauces."}
{"text":"Good selection of beers, on tap and in bottles, and a very interesting assortment of possible toppings for your hotdogs including chimichurri, spicy aiolis, chipotle ketchup, etc.  They even have vegan sausages which I found to be quite good.  My only complaint is that the buns are dry and cold.  A warm soft hotdog bun makes all the difference!  We'll return.  Chris"}
{"text":"Amazing- hot dogs with Mac & Cheese or just about anything else you want as a topping!    Don't have any creativity? They've got a list of house dogs or suggested weeners. Give them a try!   Huge beer selection too!"}
{"text":"Place rules. Perfect actually.  The burgers on Thursdays are AWESOME. Pinball machines, good food, good live music with a subwoofer the size of a bathtub,  people with class which keeps the PBR punx out of my face.  TRY to criticize this place - you'll look like a dunce."}
{"text":"Good hotdogs and vegan options. It's so packed you'd think there were no other places around to eat. If you're over 30 or over huge crowds, you probably won't care too much for the Happy Dog atmosphere. It's more like college kids being overly excited that there's something good they can afford instead of ramen all the time."}
{"text":"The palace of hot dogs is Happy Dog. Every flavor combination under the sun can be had here, all the sauces taste house made.  I personally really dig that they have a truffle mustard and some spicy asian based sauces as well.  Don't think id be adventurous enough to try fruit loops or spaghetti Os unless Im baked out of my mind but if thats your thing go for it!  The dog itself is excellent, bun absorbs the flavor combo you choose. Pick the alien relish! The only thing Ill say is they can get a little more creative with the offerings than just dogs, fries n tots, potato salad/ coleslaw. Maybe add a bad ass chilli. I get thats part of the simplistic appeal but generally when I think of a hot dog or burger joint I gotta think malts, shakes, etc.   Anyhow all in all a nice hole in the wall joint."}
{"text":"Believe what others are posting (the positive reviews). This place is also on my top dining establishments when friends and family visit Cleveland. However, I do agree with the lack of urgency on the part of some servers that other reviewers are writing about. You probably won't get the kind of attention one might find at a \"jacket and tie\" establishment. If your goal is to catch a bite to eat before the show, than you may miss your show.  With that said, just sit back, have a drink, and indulge on a custom made-to-order hot dog with a list of toppings that would make a psychometrician feel inadequate. Do yourself a favor and order the restaurant made tater-tots. They have a great selection of beer and a classic \"friendly neighborhood\" ambiance that makes Happy Dog my happy place.  PS-Parking can be difficult at times due to its location and popularity.  PPS-Monday nights are trivia night, but don't let the word \"trivia\" fool you. At times, the questions can tax even the best of a \"Jennings-esque\" wit. But don't let that scare you away. If dummies like me can survive, than I'm sure you're more than capable.  PPPS--They also have loads of events happening through out the week (i.e. live music and lectures), so be sure to check a schedule or give 'em a call."}
{"text":"Worlds greatest experience! Happy Dog is for lovers. Oh and the hot dogs are awesome. I swear you can't go wrong with any combo you do."}
{"text":"HappyDog!!! Happy Dog!!! Happy Dog!!!  YUM YUM YUM!!!   Maybe a trifle hipster poseurish but yummy hotdogs, ff and tots. Great beers and SUPERB pinball!!!! We were there before the band started but I am sure would have been enjoyed regardless.... Great little Cleveland gem!"}
{"text":"i didn't even want to give this place 1 star. i went in around 11:45, i asked if i could get some food while the bar keep was bringing out fucking food. he declined me food without even checking with the kitchen staff of a hot dog joint. then i still tried to give this place a chance and ordered a beer. i didn't leave a tip but, oh was i surprised when i got my bank statement. the fucking thief of a bar keep gave himself a tip. so you have been warned never go to happy dog and use your bank or credit card because they will rob you!"}
{"text":"I'm ashamed to even discuss how long it took me to discover happy dog.   Wow - have I been missing out!  I'm so impressed with how wonderfully a simple concept is executed.  I do not eat meat and try to avoid any dairy or eggs, unless I know the source.....and there were plenty of toppings for me to choose from.  I think 33 of the 50 hot dog toppings are vegan.  The serving of tater tots is very generous and they will let you try as many dipping sauces as you would like.  I really loved the whole fill out your own ticket idea, to avoid any confusion.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Woke up craving a chili cheese dog and lucky for me I had a willing partner to indulge on this delicious idea with me later that same evening. We showed up at Happy Dog a little after 5 and got ourselves a booth. This time around I enjoyed the atmosphere so much more because there was no band playing or crowd to fight through; I could actually talk to my date without yelling across the table! But, if we are going to be honest here there was not much talking, more so there was shoveling of hot dogs, tater tots topped with mac & cheese, and craft beers down our gullets.   I keep messing up at this place because I want to try something different so I order this fancy concoction of a hot dog and immediately regret my choice. Thankfully my date got the chili cheese dog and offered to switch with me. So the lesson here, for me at least, is stick with what you know tastes good! No need to step outside the box and put craziness on a perfectly good all beef wiener. However I do recommend putting the mac & cheese on those tots, mmm so good.   Our bill came to $25 for two hot dogs, two beers, and an order of tots and I have no complaints about the price. No issues with the staff either, they were all friendly and attentive. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"The \"newer\" Happy Dog is good, I will say that.  BUT.... the old Happy Dog with a normal menu, and less of the hipster thing going on was MUCH better.    I had lived in Cleveland for a lengthy period of time and the Happy Dog was once one of my favorite places to go.... great service, great beer selection, and good food.  That was until it went to the all hot dogs and choice of tots and fresh fries thing."}
{"text":"Dog #1: pimento mac & cheese, bacon, special fry sauce.  Dog #2: nacho cheese, chorizo chili, fried egg.  Tots w/gravy and cheddar cheese.  Three pints of GLBC.  (Drops mic from food coma.)"}
{"text":"Flipping fantastic.  Vegetarian friendly and more than decent prices here. Service rocks, music rocks, atmosphere rocks."}
{"text":"So I had heard quite a bit of chatter about this place for awhile (I live in California now, but am from Cleveland originally, so the foodies in Cleveland keep me in the loop from afar). But really, I thought- hot dogs? Okay, don't get too excited.  But boy! As soon as I sat down at my seat and took a look at the menu, my mouth started watering. I love me a wide selection of choices (who doesn't?!) and this place has it. I opted for a hot dog (meat!) with black truffle mustard, bacon balsamic marmalade, dill pickle spear, Guiness sauerkraut, sport peppers and Caribbean coleslaw. Anddddd, my mouth is watering again at the typing of this memory. Needless to say, the combination was so fantastic and oh-so-satisfying. My sister and I ordered 6 dipping sauces and an order of fries. We had an absolute blast. I believe my favorites were the bacon balsamic marmalade and Jamaican Jerk Mustard Mojo! But seriously, I was on flavor and sensory overload here.   I can't wait until I'm back in the CLE again... this will be one of my first stops!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place on earth, or at least in Cleveland!  Any place that offers a veggie dog option is ok in my book.  Add unlimited toppings, tater tots, and craft beer to that list and its a match made in heaven."}
{"text":"This is an awesome place if you love hot dogs! Its a simple place so don't expect anything to extravagant. You can get your hot dog with pretty much any kind of topping and you can't go wrong with basics like beans and eggs along with some hot sauce to spice it up. The combos are endless. Do give it a try if your ever around in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I love a good hot dog joint.  You don't go for a dog you could make at home; you want something different and delicious.  So what toppings make it unique?  How about collard greens, beer cheese, neon green relish, fruit loops, BBQ, etc.  The southern dog was my favorite, but I'm not sure you could go wrong with any of them."}
{"text":"Normally I would write a good review for this place but for the second time I have come here for the great dogs and tots and I've been told the kitchen is closed because they weren't busy enough. In my world if you advertise that you serve food till closing then you should serve food till closing. I have given this place a lot of business and have introduced many people to the great and simple food here. Now I'm not so sure I will recommend this place to people anymore. We even called ahead this time and were told the kitchen would be open until 12:30. We got there at a few minutes before 12 and were told rather rudely that the kitchen was closed. When we told the bartender we called he said he was the only one there and he never talked to anyone and told them the kitchen would be open until 12:30. Not coming back here for awhile and not recommending it to anyone either"}
{"text":"Oh happy dog.   You bring me so much joy.   If you are looking for a fun place to eat with a very laid back vibe, this is your spot.   They take the hot dog and let you get as creative as you can ever dream. I love that you can design your own, or you can look at some of the recommended combos they have. I opted to try the Breakfast of Champions dog. I'm still thinking about it.   You have to get tots while you're here too! We did one basket that was topped with pimento Mac and a cheese and another basket plain and picked 7 sauces to try. I love that you can have as many different sauces as you want-- for free.   The beer selection is also fantastic. Everything from miller lite to craft beer from Colorado. The place is no frills, fun for kids, and the prices outstanding. We had lunch for 4, (no drinking we were with the kids) and our bill was $42."}
{"text":"Go here, seriously. Even my 90 year old grandma likes this place! It's a great little hipster hangout :) Cheap and amazing, what more do you need to know? You can choose 50ish toppings for your hotdog for one price! Vegetarian? Don't worry, they have great veggie dogs :)"}
{"text":"This place is so amazing! I have so many good memories here with a couple of close friends that just moved to Florida... They still talk about how they wanna come here! The hotdogs and tater tots are unbelievable, especially with the list of toppings. The possibilities are endless! The live music can sometimes be a little out-there, but it adds to the charm.  Every time I've been here the service has been relatively quick, unless it's suuuuper busy, which is understandable. I would totally recommend this place to anyone who loves hot dogs!!!"}
{"text":"Simple great food! Love the tots with that dusting on them and trying all the dipping sauces! Can't beat happy hour either!"}
{"text":"Have been here for lunch, dinner, drinks, and at the end of the night - every time is a party. Order some tater tots and all the sauces and you won't be disappointed. AMAZING live music (with dancing!) on weekends."}
{"text":"5 star wieners here! We sat down at the bar, started a hotdog tab, and ate the night away.  And don't forget the sloppy joe and Nacho cheese covered fries. Don't forget!  What I really appreciate is the creative combos they offer up for your dogs. We loved the over-hard egg, hollandaise, bacon, and cheddar dog. Soooooo good. But there are so many and you'll be back to try another - or make up your own.   I left very happy, happy dog."}
{"text":"I was here for the first time ever a few months ago, so I really don't remember what dog I got, but it was amazing and I got tater tots with it.  I believe I got the house ketchup and the local coffee BBQ sauce with the tater tots if I'm not mistaken.  This place is incredible.  I will be back, I just haven't made it back yet.  The service was great and the quality of the dogs are awesome.  These are not ball park franks, they have to either house made or locally made.  The flavor, the snap when you bite in to it, just perfect.  The way I describe this place to all of my friends is that it's the Barrio of hot dogs.  They have everything and anything for the toppings of the dogs.  Happy Dog, I will be back!"}
{"text":"I love the all of this place, Build your own hot dog !!! hmmmmm nom nom nom"}
{"text":"Some Friends and I went here a week ago and I want to go back.  Best Dog Ive had in a while.  They offer something like 30 topping but I stuck to the basics this time.My only complaint is that the place isnt bigger, it was completely mobbed on a Saturday night but I guess most places worth going to are that time.  Might head back there this weekend."}
{"text":"So this place blew me away.  I was in Cleveland for the weekend on a day trip and we had heard good things about this place.  When we drove up, not going to lie, I was a little freaked.  But inside! Oh my God!  So cute and homey.  Added bonus: three pinball machines.  Enough to make even Tommy the pinball wizard happy.  50 toppings for your wiener (the bok choy coca-cola stir fry was AMAZING) and a decent amount for your fries or tots too.  The staff was attentive and knew a lot about dogs.  I really like mustard on hot dogs but I wanted to try the bok choy SO BAD I wanted to make both happen.  And our waitress totally led me The Way.  Boyfriend went with the warm pineapple ginger currant chutney and he also was not disappointed.  Our toppings made the bread a bit soggy and our hot dogs fell through but WE DIDN'T EVEN CARE because we were so busy shoveling food in our mouths.  And when we first walked up, we had been talking about how we weren't all THAT hungry.  Uh-huh, apparently we are when we're eating at Happy Dog."}
{"text":"Awwww, Chicago Style dogs, almost.  First visit to the dog and I liked it. Big all beef dogs with lots of options for add ons. Picked their suggestions for a Chicago style dog and it came close to those that we'd get when we lived in the city.  Loved the tots with a variety of dipping sauces. The garlic aioli was my favorite."}
{"text":"We love it! So cheap! I'm a vegetarian, and the veggie dogs are soooooooooooooo good! It's the best place to go for the money. WE LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"Great food, great music, staff is awesome. Beer list is very good for a small venue. The downstairs \"underdog\" bat has a great throwback feel. The only bad thing about this place is the fact that I'm not there right now!"}
{"text":"I admit, the times I've gone to the Happy Dog are the one Friday each month when DJ Kishka spins old polka LP's and rocks the place. Even if you're not Polish- (I'm not either) GO! A great crowd of a maybe 75% younger crowd and 25% very interesting oldsters and neighborhood characters. Where else can you go that has only 3 things on the menu-Hot dogs, fries and Tater Tots, each with about 50 available toppings. Places like these are what makes Cleveland great."}
{"text":"A bit torn about this review. Hot dog = 2 stars but service/tater tots/sauces = 5 stars.   So hot dog. I ordered a vegetarian hot dog (I'm not a vegetarian) with brie cheese, garlic aioli, Vietnamese sauerkraut, bourbon beans, and tomato.  In hindsight, these flavors were NOT a good idea. I should have ordered based on the recommended dogs instead of randomly picking flavors I liked because I ended up with a very weird, funky dog. I would definitely stay away from brie cheese in a dog and I would stay away from a vegetarian sausage if you are not a vegetarian and don't have the acquired taste for fake meat...  But aside from the dog that I couldn't finish, the tater tots with the unlimited sauces were awesome! Standouts were the Korean BBQ, chimichurri, and Momocho's habenero sauces.   Onto service, my beer took awhile to come out because it had to come from a new keg so our server offered a free beer while I waited. Excellent :)  Come and order from the recommended list and definitely have fun with the tater tots and sauces!"}
{"text":"Hot dogs are as awesome as you want to make then. Tots with chili and nacho cheese are the best. Good beer selection as well. Love this place"}
{"text":"In Columbus, we have Dirty Franks. In Cleveland, they have Happy Dog. We call these \"Hipster Hot Dog Joints.\" What a great dive this place was. Great selection of combinations for your hot dog. I had bourbon baked beans, brie, cheddar cheese, and roasted garlic aioli on mine...soooo delicious!  They also have a great craft beer selection with a fully stocked bar. Gotta check it out!"}
{"text":"The people are super friendly! And the food super good! It's a great concept! I actually had the Vegan sausage-hot dog. It felt right to do so considering the hipster feel of this Gordon square restaurant It was so good! And I can't wait to o back to try more on their menu!."}
{"text":"The sprite here is pretty good. It had the appropriate amount of lemon flavor. The only thing lacking was the amount of spice in the sprite. It only had an \"after-taste spice.\" Overall, good sprite."}
{"text":"I must first preface this by saying that I was fully aware of the \"divey\" atmosphere and poor service before I ever walked in the door. I went expecting a new dining experience that would be unique to the taste buds and fun for my soul. I got just that. The hot dog and tots were the best. The beer was great. The music was fantastic because it was not the standard Winking Lizard playlist. The juke box had all kinds of music I have never heard. Loved it. The patrons were a great mix of all sorts. My only disappointment was that I didn't have more time to spend there."}
{"text":"Great wieners and great booze! I went there on a night with a live band and had a blast. The toppings are plentiful and the options and combinations are endless. A cool and playful spot in town."}
{"text":"One of our favorite after work dinner and a drink places! Being in Gordon square makes it all the better since we can walk to some of our other favorite places!"}
{"text":"I've been to The Happy Dog twice and I really, really wanted to like it but I just can't see what the fuss is all about. The dogs are just \"ok\" and for $6 I expect something a little tastier. The second time I went I'm guessing I was sitting under a vent because my food got cold relatively fast. We were actually there to see DJ Kishka but before he appeared we were forced to listen to the piped in house music which caused my ears to bleed. I am not kidding. I am older than the staff there so maybe I'm just not hip to what's cool on the music scene these days but I actually almost walked out due to their music selection. I decided to play the jukebox but after only one song it stopped working so I just had to suffer. Anyway...I guess my point is that the service is ok, I like the atmosphere, but the hot dogs and toppings are just mediocre. I'm not a tots fan so I won't comment on those...but I thought the fries were really good."}
{"text":"Oh, Happy Dog. You are cozy and delicious and whenever I'm happily bopping to the music next to that Elvis lamp with PBR in hand, I know I'm home.   Like everyone else has mentioned, those tater tots are just ridiculous. You need them. The veggie sausage is super tasty, and I love that most of the toppings are vegetarian unless otherwise stated. Ordering in a loud bar can be a terrible experience, what with all the yelling and awkward hand gestures, but the Happy Dog has a system where you just check off your dog (regular or veggie sausage), toppings (a TON of yummy choices), and tater tots or fries. For the most part, drinks are very cheap; and the bartenders are great.  It's a great spot for live music, and the bands that play are very diverse - I really think there's something for everyone.   One thing and two teeny-tiny ~suggestions~ keep me from giving the Happy Dog 5 stars:  - That damn cover charge. Listen, I have no problem paying $5-$10 to hear live music and have a nice night out. But there are times that I'm just popping in to get a veggie dog and some tots, and I sort of resent paying that $5 cover when that's the case. I wish they'd either have no cover for parts of the evening or refund the charge when you order food.  - I would love to see the addition of a regular veggie hotdog on the menu - it would complement certain toppings better than the sausage does (not that the sausage isn't fantastic!).  - A patio! Do want!"}
{"text":"I have to be honest.  I didn't like one thing about this place.  Went there on a Sunday evening because Old Fashioned Hot Dogs/ The old Hot Dog Inn in 41st and Lorain was closed.  Me and my son really wanted a hot dog so I said why not.  Now I say NEVER again.  To start the service was nothing worth while,  I could tell they could care less for children, sorry I'm a widowed father and need to take my son out once in a while.   The noise was rediculous, you'ld think they where setting up for The Who.  They where just starting to set up for the nights entertainment,  soooo much for having a nice dinner.   The dogs where average at best,,, Come on you can't even have regular Ketchup for a kid,,,  poppy seads on the bun do not work for kids as well.  Hate to say it but don't take your kids.  Keep your expectations low then they might deliver."}
{"text":"With an incredible bar and a simple menu that features \"build your own dogs\" (which are HIGH quality dogs, by the by) and tater tots made of (probably) crack, a good time and a full tummy are guaranteed at the Happy Dog.  Part of the charm is the very \"neighbourhood\" bar feel of the place. It doesn't end there, though! The crowd is as diverse and eclectic as the the entertainment and activities that they host. For those of you who don't know, Happy Dog hosted one of the Cleveland Orchestra summer events when they did their residency in Gordon Square. This is not just a place that rocks or sings the blues, it is a place for ALL people."}
{"text":"I came by here the other day with some friends for lunch after hearing great things, and it was quite a lunch!!!   It's definitely a unique hot dog experience, although with all the toppings, it's less about the hot dog itself and more about what you put on it.  There are so many toppings to choose from that it got a little overwhelming, but it was quite fun picking some crazy hot dog with mac and cheese, baked beans, some kind of spicy ketchup, garlic aioli, etc. on.   I also had a side of tater tots that came with a long list a dips that could be tried with it (I enjoyed the garlic aioli).  With so many toppings, one hot dog and some tater tots was actually too much for me!  Luckily my friends finished off the tots, haha.    Because you get to pick your own ingredients, I think the end result can be a hit or miss depending on what you choose, but then again I suppose it's your own fault if that happens.  I had a tomato tampenade that didn't quite mesh as well with my other hot dog ingredients, but really I only have myself to blame.  It was a fun experience going to Happy Dog, but also likely a pretty fattening one, so I'd need to wear my eating pants next time.  It's definitely worth taking a trip to check out this place if you haven't been there yet, though."}
{"text":"Stopped by 3 Fri ago. Walked in about 4:15, sat at the bar. 10 minutes later I left after no one noticed me. Barmaid sat behind bar with her feet propped up & never moved. Bar guy was texting for 5 minutes, then went into the back never to return. Stock boy put beer under the bar where I was sitting but ignored me. So I went to River Dog for really good service and a great hotdog. Too bad HD. One star not low enough."}
{"text":"A guest and myself rolled up to Happy Dog on a weekday at about 9. We did not expect to be hit up for a cover charge. I am overall not holding that against the \"Dog\" in my review. I sucked it up and paid the cover at my guest's encouragement. I will say if it is past \"get in free time\" I would pass it up and go somewhere else because it essentially made my hot dog a 10 dollar hot dog, because honestly I wasn't feeling the band that was there that evening.  Now, to the food and the experience. my hot dog was exactly what I expected which is awesome because that so rarely happens. It was tasty the toppings were silly good and I felt appropriately proportioned. I had the hot dog sauce, bleu cheese coleslaw, truffle mustard . I also liked I could drink a tasty Black Label for only two dollars. Overall I look forward to going again. I hear that \"The Underdog\" is cool. I will just make sure I go in before cover time."}
{"text":"Only my second time at this place a couple weekends ago. My girlfriend and I stopped in after a football and were surprised to find it not so busy. The dogs and tots are delicious. Vast choice of toppings and they are plenty good. Not to mention the seasonal beers and full bar. Bartender was excellent and the only complaint both me and my girlfriend had was that the buns just could not contain the Happy Dog goodness. They were soggy from the time we got them. Invest in better buns!"}
{"text":"I don't drop 5-stars that easily but I thoroughly enjoyed this place.  I was visiting Cleveland for the weekend and heard about this spot.  So worth it.  Price was right,  food was yummy and only a short drive from downtown.  Plus, I love a good dive!   I loved the originality of the toppings they offered...especially because a few made me think, \"Really??\"  So, to answer your question: Yes. Chunky peanut butter and hot dogs totally work.    Leave immediately if all you want is a hot dog with ketchup.  You'll be shaming Happy Dog with an order like that.  BRING THIS PLACE TO NJ!"}
{"text":"Oh, I could come here over and over and over again because there are so many options to choose from.  I topped my dog with chunky peanut butter and chili, and it was an excellent choice.  The other excellent choice I made was ordering my tater tots with BBQ dust.  In all honestly though: is there a bad option to put on these dogs and tots? Yeah, I didn't think so either."}
{"text":"Coming after a visit the previous day to Old Fashioned Hot Dogs also in the area, comparisons were inevitable. I wish we had a Happy Dog equivalent here, where you can build your own hot dog.   I have a huge thing for \"build your own\" anything. Wait, I have a huge thing for \"build your own\" huge thing, so it goes without saying that what I ended up ordering, or 'creating' rather, was a massive piled collection of no less than SIXTEEN ingredients, but with only one sauce -housemade ketchup-, and if I were to rate this place purely on the uniqueness of the dish, I honestly couldn't give them the full five stars.   However, all but two ingredients on my plate were ace, with the unfortunate two ingredients being the fried egg there was hardly any white because of burnt edges- and the buns -unsalvageable by the time I got to the bottom due to the pile of stuff sitting on them-.   If I ever went back, I would be much more in control of my eyes which tend to get bigger than my stomach, obviously. I might even order from their separate menu of recommended combinations.  We had a side order of tater tots with six dipping sauces. Tots were good, and my two favorite sauces were Brazilian Chimichurri and Chipotle Mayo. They also have a full size bar and a spot with live music facilities."}
{"text":"Hot dogs, many toppings, tater tots, large beer selection, hipsters, oh my!  This place is great. Crowds can be an issue, sometimes the live music can get loud,  but Happy Dog is a tasty novelty that brings great character to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"The hot dogs at Happy Dog are far from your Sugardale dollar dogs at Progressive Field.  These dogs make my mouth water and the seemingly endless list of toppings (from garlicky bacon escarole to froot loops to spaghetti-os) makes every experience unique. Don't forget their list of delicious house sauces, including a special guest appearance by some of Momochos salsa! The tator tots with the aioli are a hit every time. Pair your dinner with a craft beer and live polka music and you're set."}
{"text":"A unique Cleveland gem! It has a bit of a dive bar atmosphere and the food is both fun and delicious.   I recommend the veggie dog to any vegan/vegetarians out there. It tastes like Italian Sausage and the texture is spot-on, unlike a lot of meatless options. Topped mine with Pimento Mac & Cheese, Bugles, secret fry sauce, & pickle relish.  The tots are also fun with unlimited sauce choices. I recommend the garlic aioli & secret fry sauce."}
{"text":"I was only in Cleveland for one night and this seemed like an appropriate choice. Great service, yummy dogs, and we got there halfway through trivia night. If I ever come here again I would get MORE TOPPINGS because it is a flat fee and these guys are clearly pros and could handle it."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! A small \"dive\" bar with a retro vibe, a decent beer list, and fantastic hot dogs. Literally, the hot dogs are one of-a-kind. If you're a \"foodie\", you have to checkout this place out.   The beef is high quality, juicy, and full of flavor. You can choose from a laundry list of divine toppings including multiple kinds of cheeses, pickled veggies, house-made condiments, meat toppings, and unique items all for one flat price. You can order as many different kinds of dipping sauces as you want, free of charge as well (I highly recommend the chipotle ketchup, garlic aoili, and this one spicy mustard which I forgot the name of)  The servers and bartenders were all friendly, we were greeted promptly and our food came out quickly.   If you're looking for a casual and inexpensive date night or a place to meet up with friends to share great food and drink, while supporting a local pub, check out Happy Dog - another great local spot here in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Cleveland knows WHAT'S UP. This hot dog joint is so awesome, I don't even know how to begin my praise..  - $5 for a huge hotdog with UNLIMITED toppings - The craziest toppings in THE WORLD, like spaghetti o's, soba noodles, sriracha, chunky peanut butter, froot loops, hot fries, etc. - Awesome beer selection - LIVE MUSIC! - The friendliest bartenders ever  If you're ever in Cleveland, this is the spot you do NOT wanna miss!"}
{"text":"Great hotdogs and as many toppings as you can fit on the hotdog for only $5. They have 50 different toppings. Some of them are pretty interesting like coco puffs, hot fries, peanut butter, etc. I definitely recommend getting the Vegan Sausage. It tastes just like an Italian Sausage.  Additionally they have tater tots or fries for $3 with as many toppings as you can fit on them. The fries and tots themselves were crispy and potatoy.  When we visited Happy Dog, the place was currently reserved by some senior citizen organization. There were still a few tables left for walk-ins. It's nice to see that no matter what age you are you still enjoy a good hot dog at a local bar."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a unique place that gives you lots of food for your money, this is it. You fill out a little checklist of anything (and really everything) you want on your hot dog, fries, or tots. You can really get creative and come up with some crazy combinations, or just play it safe. The portions are huge for the price and you definitely won't leave hungry. Family friendly during the day and often featuring live music at night. The beer selection is great and pairs well with whatever creation you come up with to eat. Parking is available in an adjacent lot or on the street. Definitely give it a try!"}
{"text":"If you love hot dogs (vegetarian/vegan options available too!) and variety, this is the place for you. The toppings/dipping sauces are what makes this place unique. Craft beers and the occasional live bands only add to the awesome atmosphere. Not feeling the hipster vibe? This place is fairly family friendly and casual."}
{"text":"Happy Dog makes me a happy lady!  Okay, I'm sorry for the bad pun, but it's the truth!  Like all the other reviewers mentioned, you can get a regular hot dog or a veggie dog with a large variety of toppings, all for $5. You can't get more bang for your buck! You can go for something light or heavy, traditional or wacky (hot fries or fruit loops, what?), whatever suits your mood. I have tried many different combinations here. I would recommend the dog Michael Symon mentioned on the Food Network show, \"The Best Thing I Ever Ate:\" regular hot dog with alien relish, sriracha, peanut butter (it sounds seriously weird, but it is fantastic)! Last time I was here, I tried the veggie dog for the first time, and I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked it! It has a \"meaty\" texture and a spicy flavor, and I think I may even like it more than the normal hot dog (gasp!).  Happy Dog also offers fries or tater tots as sides. Both are average, and I consider them as more of a vessel to sample all their tasty dipping sauces (chimichurri and special fry sauce, oo la la!). When my friends and I get the fries, we usually get sloppy joe meat and melted cheese to make chili cheese fries.  Monday nights, Happy Dog has trivia. My team and I always fail miserably, but we keep coming out to try! Make sure you come early enough to find a place to sit, because space fills up pretty quickly.  On most other nights, the Happy Dog has live music. And even though some bands are definitely better than others, hanging out and listening to the music is always a fun way to spend the night, and a great way to find out about new bands.  Happy Dog is a Cleveland gem that's for sure worth checking out!"}
{"text":"LOVE Happy Dog. How can you wrong with make your own hot dog creation for a couple bucks? They have an insane list of toppings from nacho cheese to fruit loops.  The French fries are awesome. I wouldn't suggest the veggie dog, stick to the beef dog. They have a great beer selection. The atmosphere is a little uncomfortable but the food makes it worth it.   They offer trivia (which I've heard is fun) and host a pinball league (which I've also heard is fun). This is a Cleveland MUST DO."}
{"text":"Great place, great service, great food. Happy to have found it during out short stay. You must try peanut butter on the hot dogs. It's amazing."}
{"text":"Really brings back some kind of nostalgia that made me want to order a Shirley temple and look to the stool to the left and see my grandfather sipping a PBR. I ordered the mobile home wrecker.  A all beef dog with pork and beans, caramelized onions, cheddar cheese and Alabama white bbq sauce. It was good quality, a little messy but not too messy. (There was 2 napkins wrapped around the silverware for good measure) I also ordered a side of fries with the house ketchup. The fries were okay, the house ketchup was really good!! The ketchup made okay fries fall in the background of the ketchup that had a little bit of zip ( not so much it was overbearing). I will probably commute the 100 blocks again to have another dog and to remember sitting on a bar stool next to my grandfather."}
{"text":"I love the vibe and the food! Not often I go out for a hot dog, but it's worth checking out! The beer selection is great and the hot dog condiments and add ones are amazing!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my hot dogs, there are tons of options for customizing your dog, and the service is one of the best."}
{"text":"While this \"hot dog\" bar isn't fancy, it sure is fun. The hot dogs are delicious and the toppings, .... wow! I got a veggie dog which was perfectly cooked with lots of vegetable and vegetarian toppings. Everyone -- including my picky 10 year old -- got into the fun and loved their meat and/or veggie meal. The tater tots were perfect and the sauces delightful. Definitely worth the drive into Cleveland from the interstate."}
{"text":"I know every Larry, Darryl, and Darryl have been here already, so I'm not about to write anything revolutionary.    I do want to say I had a fantastic first time at Happy Dog on Friday, April 11.  Polka Happy Hour with DJ Kishka was underway when I entered, and the room was rockin.  All types of people, young to old, of varying ethnicities (and even a few children) were kicking back with beverages and looked to be having a fantastic time.  I sat down at the bar, and was able to promptly order an Okocim.  Even with a full room, the bartenders were very efficient and kept me happy the entirety of my stay.  Now, I had heard many a great thing about the dogs but I was skittish this night, as I do keep a Lenten abstinence from meat on Fridays.  Fearing a vegan dog that would be a bland tofu turd, I was pleasantly surprised to find that my dog had a nice sausagey consistency and was spiced to give it a bit of a kick.  The incredible list of toppings allows for terrific flavor profiles, and I'm sure can lend to some creative \"chefery\" after a few beverages.  I went with chunky peanut butter, pickled carrot & daikon, cucumbers, and hot chili sauce.  I was in heaven.    I'm looking forward to spending many more evenings here, and pushing the boundaries of hot dog possibilities.  What a great place to have in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Such a welcoming bar. Quick service,  and plenty of beers on draft. Made the trip from Columbus worth my time."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love a hot dog?? Weirdos. Especially if they don't like these. This place is always delicious and hits the spot."}
{"text":"Great local bar with a good beer selection.  They support so many local bands and host a variety of other events that it always makes for a very friendly atmosphere.  The hot dogs and toppings are delicious, but I am personally not a fan of their vegan dog.  The only problem I've ever encountered is that most (not all!) of the bartenders seem a bit slow and unambitious, and it really shows when they're crowded."}
{"text":"This is a fun place. Create your own type menu with lots of topping. Cool atmosphere. The only downside is the waitstaff. They seem to think they are in an elite click.... That work at a hot dog joint. My friends order arrived with bacon which she didn't order and the waiter said \"I just won't charge you for it\" she said I really don't like bacon and his response was \"who doesn't like bacon?\" and it wasn't a playful response he was actually giving her attitude about the fact someone had messed her order up and he had to fix it. Our service drastically declined after that."}
{"text":"This is the kind of place San Francisco needs!  Awesome high quality BIG all beef dogs with an almost endless assortment of toppings at reasonable prices.  I had Kimchi and Brie on mine and it was great.  The home made condiments where super as well.  Great selection of local craft beers (just wish they had some descriptions of them) and the staff was super friendly.  The trivia night sounded like the kind of trivia I'm good at.  Dirty.  Next time I'm in Cleveland I'll be stopping back."}
{"text":"We had happy dog at the Indians stadium and loved it... so tonight while at edgewater live with our out of town friends we decided it was way to hott outside and left to go to happy dog.. when we finally got there we walked in and this insanely drugged man told us it was a $5 cover charge.. I said all we wanted to do was eat plus we didn't have any cash...He barley could keep his eyes open to tell us \"sorry man there is a band playing tonight give me $5 if you want to get in\"  needless to say we left.   We would have spent more money between the four of us on food and drinks than the $20 they wanted for us 4 to get in..."}
{"text":"Good food, awful service.  Went for a late lunch on a Sunday.  No less than five people behind the bar but it took over five minutes for anybody to take a drink order.  Couldn't get a refill on water, but the bartenders all had time to do at least one shot (a few had more than one).  Food was awesome as always, but maybe sit at a table unless you know one of the bartenders."}
{"text":"Trivia night at a hot dog stand? Youhav lots of drafts and bottles from a good selection of local breweries?  You have my attention. $5 dog with over 50 available topings you say.  I am intrigued.  What's that?  I beg your pardon.  I can get all 50 topings on my dog?  That's got to be one pricey hotdog!  No extra charge for the topings?  You sir, are a mad man.  I like you, but you're MAD I say!  Great dogs, and with a seemingly endless possibilty of combinations, they'll never be the same."}
{"text":"Alright, so I've been to Happy Dog twice. Once, just to hang out and catch up with a friend over beers, and the second time was on trivia night. Gotta love trivia. The first time my friend and I were sort of forced downstairs because there was a band playing upstairs. I'm fine with the basement's grungy-type feel, but honestly it was still so loud from the music, it was still difficult to have a conversation. So, not the best for us there. The bartender downstairs was super nice though.  When we went to trivia a few weeks ago, I was excited to finally try one of their famous dogs and some tots. The food was fine - there was a little bit too much aioli on my dog, but otherwise everything was great. Loved all the different sauce options, of course, especially the Alabama white BBQ and thai chili and garlic sauce. I'm not into PBR or Genesee Cream Ale (call me a beer snob, I don't care!) so we racked up quite a bill just on beer alone, pretty much leveling out the cheapness of the food. They do have a great beer list, although it apparently needed to be updated. I asked the bartender what the \"seasonal\" specials were and she said they really didn't have any seasonals at the time. So that was pretty weird, but we sat at the bar the whole time and overall service was friendly enough and quick.  Trivia night is ridiculous. I know this place has a hipster reputation, but even as a group of educated, relatively culture-savvy 20-somethings, we felt out of place. Lots of obscure music questions, and not a whole lot of variety. I love when trivia nights are actually challenging, but this was just ostracizing. Might be back for beer, but not on Monday nights!"}
{"text":"I eat here WAY too much! But I love the atmosphere and the the prices. Be a champ and get the pimento mac and chesse and a fried egg on your hotdog. The black truffle honey mustard and the coffee BBQ sauce is amazing for the tots. Be careful when you go to just eat though, because at too busy of a time and they get skimpy with toppings or forget them all together! Pretty good beer selection too!"}
{"text":"This hidden treasure in CLE is becoming a little more mainstream.  The food is quick, cheap, and delicious.  What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Everything you could want on a Hot Dog and more can be found at this place.  Also, they have some of the nicest bartenders in the city.  And they have a great line up of bands playing here."}
{"text":"This place has a wonderful vibe. Think about a place with great confort food, amazing choice of toppings for your hot dog (you can be brave on a scale of 1 to 50 toppings), large selection of beers and add some live music, nice service and big TV screens showing live sports. This is a great place to go, specially to hang out with your friends on a late afternoon."}
{"text":"What a great deal! Loved all the sauces we got for the tater tots (chimichurri was very memorable). Amazing staff and great selection on tap. Hot dogs were delicious."}
{"text":"Decent place. It's always really hot and sweaty there. Usually pretty crowded on the weekends. A good selection of drinks available but no Fireball.  Live music is great. The downstairs bar is more my cup of tea. Smaller and darker and less crowded. I have gone back."}
{"text":"This place seemed awesome until me and my boyfriend got violent food poisoning from it. And I got the vegan dog...with vegan chili so I'm really confused about this one. The cheap local ipa was nice. Waitstaff was adequate for the crowded night we came into. Environment is hipster/divey. Just go for a beer."}
{"text":"Best dive bar in all of CLE.  I've been there numerous times and have never been disappointed.  Don't be afraid to order a ton of different sauces on the side to try out for your next visit.  I have never had anything but stellar service and the hotdogs are amazing just by themselves.  The tots are the best!!!"}
{"text":"These folks have the dog and tot experience down.  Fast and friendly with great music bookings and sports on the TV.  Always a good value and you can easily find parking, even though we often walk when it isn't weather unconscious. They don't need another review from me, but I like this place quite a bit and will miss it when we move. Never forget Hamburger Thursday in the Underdog.  They had a retro-gaming night set up the last few times we did this You know the legacy consoles with Mario Kart and Mortal Combat etc. Pinball tournaments weekly. Place is a cool as it gets."}
{"text":"Love the vibe, love the list to build your own dogs and tots, love the old school bar and mod lighting, love it all. Would recommend to anyone who likes something different but good. Bravo."}
{"text":"Loud trendy bar and hot dogs joint onWest Side of Cleveland.  Menu includes veggie and beef dogs and a monster list of toppings- I had the veggie with egg and hot salsa- a breakfast treat- I also tried a great local beer called Holy Moses- named after Moses Cleveland.  Bar tenders are great- I like the long bar with is semi circular with attached stools. This is a good spot."}
{"text":"Great hot dog and tons of unique toppings this place is awesome. Tater tots are also great with plenty of sauces for dipping. This is the Best hot dog spot in Cleveland"}
{"text":"Happy Dog has recently went through a series of significant upgrades, with all tweaks being for the greater good....  A few months ago, Eric Williams (chef/owner of Momocho) jumped on board, bringing with him the \"hot-dog\" theme over the previous Eastern European fare. It's now open 7 days a week (4 p.m. to 2:30 a.m. daily, opening at 11 a.m. Friday for lunch), with talks of adding a Sunday brunch and outdoor patio in the future. The décor was cleaned up a bit, but still maintains a hip, yet cozy vibe. When the Quentin Tarantino-esque tunes aren't serenading the crowd from the juke-box, live local acts are. Well, Thursday thru Saturday at least and with a minimal cover.   The bar now features a greater variety of craft beer offerings. For a list of suds offered, wander up to the bar and browse the chalkboard. I settled for the Dogfish Head IPA draft.   The menu is minimalistic only at first sight. 3 things are offered: Hot Dogs, Fries and Tater Tots. Then things get downright crazy! SAT-test bubbles on the menu are used to create your order from 50 hot dog toppings and 19 dipping sauces for the tots/fries. Don't worry, #2 pencils are at each table. The combination's you can create are basically limitless and unique to each diner.   The regular dogs are 1/4 lb. all beef franks made by Cleveland's Blue Ribbon Meats. They also offer homemade veggie dogs and most all toppings are vegetarian unless conveniently labeled with an asterisk.   I ordered the regular dog with bacon spiked southern style greens, ancho chile bbq sauce and potato chips. My wife had her dog with chunky peanut butter, bacon, warm pineapple ginger-currant-chutney and topped with sprinkles. With two plates of tots (perfect for dunking btw), we ordered 6 dipping sauces: chipotle ketchup, black truffle honey mustard, brazilian chimichurri, chipotle hollandaise and a few others.   While unconvinced at first, as soon as I dove into this glorious creation, I was instantly sold on the concept. It was pure genius. I love the vibe of this place too. Can't wait to come back. This is the perfect dive bar that I'd love to call my own. I just wish I lived closer. Westsiders, consider yourselves fortunate. You have a real gem on your hands!"}
{"text":"Quite the dive bar.  Good beer selection, super casual atmosphere, and the best dogs in Cleveland. They have at least 50 different things to put on top so it's totally customizable. Get whatever you want as long as you get the fried egg. So good.   They also have a bunch of random event lineups, from mathmaticians talking theory, to classical music concerts, polka, experimental electronica and more. Find something eclectic that suites you!   If you wander in and there is nothing special going on upstairs, they have shuffleboard and some other games downstairs"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. After one night, I am a huge fan.  First, I was struck by how unassuming this place is. The sign outside is rather small and on walking inside it looks like any corner bar you'd find in Old Brooklyn or Parma. A few booths, a few tables and plenty of red, swively bar stools. Very low-key and very comfortable. With the success of Momocho, Eric Williams really could have made this place into something much more trendy - but he didn't, and I respect him greatly for that.  During the day you'll see a mixed bag of people: families, couples, blue collar workers, white collar workers. After dark, the hipsters emerge like vampires and fill the place up. If you arrive to watch the transition you'll have some great people watching.   The menu is simple: hot dogs, veggie dogs, falaffel. Your sides include fries or tater tots. Toppings are another story.  50 hot dog toppings ranging from bacon to \"alien\" relish to fruit loops. The guy down the bar from us got fruit loops and nacho cheese. No joke. I had chorizo chili, blue cheese slaw, relish and potato chips. Amazing!   Now, normally I am all about the snap on a hot dog, but here I didn't miss it. The hot dog is so thick and so flavorful and so full of toppings that you don't miss it. You kind of need to result to using your knife and fork anyway. If you get past bite 5 without your bun eventually seizing from the weight of the greatness on top, you are a) a faster eater than I or b) totally unadventurous and didn't get any fun toppings.   High marks for the fabulous tater tots (with chipotle hollandaise and a fried egg, in my case) and a great selection of beers."}
{"text":"Live music, awesome new beers to try, basement is pretty sick.... but build your own hot dogs?!? I say yes!! Kid friendly during the week and before 9 p.m, pricing is pretty fair and I highly recommend the tots!"}
{"text":"Happy Dog is a great example of a dive bar in Cleveland. They have live music that can get pretty loud, but the beer selection was great and the hot dogs you can get are fabulous. For $6, you can get a fully loaded hot dog with everything from macaroni and cheese to pickled items.   I think it's a great value for allowing you to put pretty much whatever you want on it and the service was fast and attentive. While the location isn't the most convenient, it's a great place to grab a quick and casual bite with a reasonable beer selection.  Bottom line, if you want a dive bar, this one should check off all of the best parts of the dive bar with great hot dogs, but possibly a bit loud when the band comes to play."}
{"text":"hotdog?   check.  TONS of toppings to choose from?   check good drinks?   check friendly bartenders?   check good music?   check  what more do you need?"}
{"text":"Happy Dog is a very clever concept - lots of eclectic topping choices on a hot dog.  It's a divey place located in a very hip part of Cleveland, Ohio, which we visited on a recent roadtrip to the Midwest in mid-October.  I saw that it got A LOT of reviews and seemed fun, so we decided to stop by.  I would love to have given it a highter rating than a \"3,\" but there was something about the food that didn't set well with me and made my stomach feel a bit uneasy (though thankfully not sick).    The toppings ranged from the relatively normal, like chipotle ketchup, black truffle honey mustard, and sriracha hot sauce to the truly insane toppings like warm apricot-cherry-currant chutney and Oaxacan red chile and chocolate mole.  Oh, and you also have the option of soba noodles, which I ordered on my hot dog.  It was quite a strange combo...  I personally ordered roasted garlic aioli, kim chee pickles, hiosin soba noodles, and applewood smoked bacon on my hot dog.  An odd but interesting combination.  I can't say that I would order it again.  They're also famous for their tator tots, which we ordered.  We got a few dipping sauces, including the roasted garlic aioli and the \"coffee\" dipping sauce, which was quite strange!  Again, maybe my experience here just wasn't the best, but I can't give it any more than 3 stars, as much as I'd like to and as much as I appreciate the concept."}
{"text":"Brought my daughter here after a day at the beach. Awesome selections of toppings. Way cool ordering system. If you love loaded tots, fries or hot dogs this is the way to go!"}
{"text":"Super unimpressed with this place, although the service is good. They do provide several options for toppings, but the price did not seem worth it. I'd rather spend $30 elsewhere. I do recommend the tots with \"dust\" if you must go."}
{"text":"So fun! Love going here on Saturday nights with friends, listening to live music and grabbing a bite to eat. Everyone is really friendly and I always leave with a smile from a nice time."}
{"text":"I've had decent service in the past but today was bad. I had placed an order with my friend and waited a while. My friend got served and I noticed other people that came in after me were getting their food. I finally had enough and told them to cancel my order. I was then charged for my pop and was given nothing for the inconvenience. If I would have at least been comped the pop I could chalk it up to a busy night but its apparent this is the type of place that has the attitude \"take it or leave it.\" I'll leave it and urge friends to try other places around town."}
{"text":"Great place for live music, junk food & booze. Truly, an exceptional CLE experience."}
{"text":"A few of my colleagues and I drove about 70 minutes round trip to try Happy Dog out for lunch...and we left happy.  My personal opinion is that the spot itself is a bit questionable. I am not a fan of the bar scene - and this place is definitely a bar - but it was clean, well laid out, and well staffed.  The ordering process left a bit to be desired: paper tablets where you configure your hot dog that, to avoid the confusion some of us suffered - should be considered as one page per hot dog. There was a list on the front of toppings and sides were presented on the back.  I went with two dogs and the tots:  #1 - hot dog with pimento mac and cheese and bourbon baked beans #2 - hot dog with yuengling kraut, truffle mustard and cheddar  Both were tasty (I only made it through 1.5), but #1 won me over and will be the reason for my return.  I also tried the tater tots with the dusting of something-or-other and would recommend them as well.  The verdict overall: good dogs, inventive toppings, worth the trip for sure!"}
{"text":"Happy Dog is a Cleveland institution. If you don't try it at least once, you're not a true Clevelander.  The pictures on here may not do it justice, but it's always a good idea to put random things on a hot dog. Or at least this local watering hole of general coolness plays gypsy mind tricks to make you THINK it's a good idea. Anyone can find something they like here, and if they can't, then they are lying to you and probably not really your friend.  The concept is so unique in a Cleveland way. Pile your hearts desires of interesting toppings atop a veg or non-veg hot dog with your write-in sheet. On mine, I typically put an egg, various cheeses, and a slaw. I also suggest a side of tots, and choosing an array of their locally inspired sauces. This is the place to experiment! They also have a pretty rad beer selection, so drink up.  I realize this all sounds nuts, but you won't regret your decision. On certain nights, you can even catch live bands, poets or other artists. I love a bar/restaurant that also cares about cool, culturally relevant and local programming. Via La Happy Dog!"}
{"text":"It's little joints like this that make me more than happy to call Cleveland my adopted hometown.   1. This place is foremost a great bar, with a top-shelf liquor selection and a range of beer including a few brews I have actually never heard of. And I drink a lot of over-priced beer, mind you.  2. There's a huge framed photo of the Replacements hanging out with a giant Domo. That is fucking hysterical.  3. The food. Damn you, the food. Huge-ass hot dogs with your choice of about 50 toppings. I went conservative and got chorizo chili. A dude across the bar got chili AND a fried egg -- all of this on top of a quarter-pound wiener. Sweet Jesus. Also, the tater tots are to die for -- perfectly fried like mom could never make them. Get a side of nacho cheese. Trust me.  4. Look, just go here."}
{"text":"Been here many times.  Love their field roast veggie dog (actually, it's the veggie sausage) and all of the combinations that are available.  Also, their tots are amazing.  The service is much better here than the University Circle location."}
{"text":"The. Best. Once my friends and I found out this place existed, we came back probably once week. For $5 you get a hotdog with any one of 50 interesting toppings ranging from ketchup, to coco puffs to chimmicurri.  Note to newcomers: you will want to put 800 things on your hotdog, but restraint is key - I aim for not more than 5-6 toppings. I will also echo other reviews that say they should look into different buns. These never hold up, even with my small amount of topings. Perhaps grilling the buns would also help.   There are also tots or fries. I typically love tots, but here I find that the fries are much better. They come with free sauces as well, and they are on the side, so if you are interested in trying some, get it with the tots instead of on your hot dog.  Beer selection is pretty good, and most are in the $5-6 dollar range.  This place gets packed, for good reason. Sometimes you can find a place to sit if you go downstairs. But, do avoid polka night. I've yet to figure out why, but people get super into it, and the place is even busier than normal."}
{"text":"Good if ya go on an off hour or Sunday brunch.  Staff is mostly cool.  Some act like they are too cool for school though.  Check before ya go on weekend nites...sometimes they charge a fee for hipster band or \"movie\" nite...  GREAT HOT DOGS and KILLER BEER SELECTION!!  Great poster on wall and cool old school bar feel.,,"}
{"text":"This place is a Cleveland gem.  I have been countless times and love trying different combinations of hot dogs, which area always delicious.  It can get crowded so search for a good barstool and don't move :)  Great beer list!  Love playing the pinball machines and the arcade games in the basement.  They started serving tator tots before everyone decided it was cool again."}
{"text":"this place basically rules. not too many places in cleveland that you can just go and hangout/possibly eat without mister defend cleveland t-shirt gettin in your face and ruining your night with their ignorant opinions and stanky PBR breath. the food rocks- maybe a little too hard considering after i took my mom there (yes, my mom) she has cravings for it. cool draft selection, and now they have good humor ice cream for dessert."}
{"text":"Happy Dog is honestly better than any hot dog joint has a right to be.  My friends and I went there and each got a hot dog with the side of gator tots, and it was so good and filling we left very satisfied.  When you first walk in and take a look at the menu, it can definitely be overwhelming. I decided to try my own design, and got peanut butter and alien relish with the garlic escarole.  It was really good, but next time I am going to order something else to find that perfect combination.  The hot dogs can be hard to eat sometimes, depending on what kind of topping you get too.  When we went, we also didn't order any drinks, but hopefully next time I can try out some of the beers they offer as well.  All in all, I can't wait to go back and try my next creation!"}
{"text":"I loved everything about Happy Dog, except maybe the way my stomach felt the next day. Truly, my only regret was that I could only consume a hot dog and a half! I wanted to try everything.  I went with two \"suggestive weiners\" recommended by the Happy Dog staff. The first was chunky peanut butter, onions, mole sauce & bacon, & it wasn't too overstuffed. To die for! It wasn't nearly as gross as I suspected it might be and was, in fact, quite delicious.  Second up: red onions, BBQ sauce, cheddar cheese, cajun corn stick and chorizo chili. Also amazing, but I could only eat about a third of it. It was a little soggy, too - the buns aren't great - and didn't make for great leftovers, but I guess I could've expected that!  We each got an order of tater tots & a different dipping sauce to share - saffron aioli, Thai chili sauce and BBQ sauce. All SO GOOD - one subtle, one spicy, one sweet.  Also: two PBRs in a can.  In other words? Rarely have I been so happy in my entire life."}
{"text":"Though I was a little shocked by what I had to pay for a hot dog and two beers, I'm glad I finally made it out to the West Side to check out Happy Dog. That food was delicious, the homemade condiments are an inspired touch, and the atmosphere of the place is so effortlessly cool."}
{"text":"$5 for a great hot dog with up to 50 toppings, wow what a treat. I visited a college friend last weekend and she and her husband love this great hole in the wall local bar. They told me stories of the combinations they've come up with and their kids love putting peanut butter & jelly on, yes a hot dog. I tried a dog with sriracha hot sauce, friend's husband's suggestion, Yuengling sauerkraut and blue cheese colesaw - mmm good. I liked it so much I had to order another. The tots are top notch and we ordered a variety of sauces and we decided the Brazilian chimichurri was the best. Great variety of beer on tap and bottle. I tried a Willoughby Peanut Butter Cup Porter, interesting choice more of dessert, but I'm always up for trying a beer I've never tried before. They have pinball and pool in the basement. Definitely stop by and enjoy the next time you're in the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"Happy Dog is a small divey bar/restaurant tucked in Cleveland's west side. It's fairly accessible to both east and west siders, so the location choice is pretty nice.  I went with my friend, seeing how this restaurant has an average 4.5 rating on Yelp with so many reviews. I wanted to give it a try to see how I felt about it myself.  The service is a ok, though I had to wait quite a while to get served. It may have had to do with the fact that filming was going on that day for a commercial, but the wait still was an upwards of 20 minutes even with plenty of open seats.  I find it pretty cool that you can order a hot dog and put as many toppings as you want on it. You can also order the tater tots with as many dipping sauces as you'd like. I wanted to try something different, so I got a vegan dog with chorizo chili, mushrooms, sunny side up egg, tomatoes, onions, chipotle ketchup and \"Korean BBQ sauce.\"  The resulting hot dog was so large that I was unable to hold it with my hands - I had to knife and fork it or make a mess on myself. While I do like the high levels of customization, I found the flavors to be... fairly standard. The hot dog didn't stand out to me as anything extraordinary. It was still tasty, but didn't taste any different from any hot dog I could get at any restaurant.  A cool restaurant to visit, for sure, but as far as the flavors go, fairly standard."}
{"text":"You get what you go for.  I love the concept of the menu. If you're craving dogs, tots and loaded fries, go to Happy Dog. The menu is not difficult with too many options. You go for the dogs, the tots and the fries. That's it. No fuss, no hassle, no \"oh no, there are so many choices I don't know what I want\" type of visit.   It's a decently sized bar and there's usually live music, which is always a point gainer for me. You order your food at the bar and when it's done they bring it to your table, if you're lucky to get one.   TIP: PUT AN EGG ON IT. You won't regret it.   I go here when I'm craving quality dogs and a side of tots with unlimited dipping sauces."}
{"text":"Love the veggie dog with the chimichurri sauce. I wish they carried the bleu cheese coleslaw and hot fries like the one on the east side, but I will keep bugging them and I'm sure once they realize I eat there once a week they will keep a special container in the fridge just for me."}
{"text":"What's not to love about a restaurant with vegan dogs and tots?  I stopped in on a blustery Saturday afternoon for lunch and was overwhelmed by the smell of a cleaning solution. I know that some older establishments can get a little funky, but all I smelled the entire time I was there was this cleaner. Not the delicious tots or anything else that might have been more pleasant.   Service was fast and the people who waited on us were really nice. I had to use my phone to look at the online menu to figure out what was and wasn't vegan, but that was no biggie. I ordered a vegan dog with chili, kraut, and alien relish. I honestly might have liked my \"dog\" more if I'd just had the bun. I like Field Roast sausages and all, but...it kind of overpowered the toppings.  The tater tots were...tater tots. I ordered a bunch of different vegan dipping sauces to try out and I especially like the BBQ sauce.   Overall, I think this is a decent place to grab a quick, gluttonous lunch. Not sure I'd eat here all the time, but...I'm happy that CLE has a hot dog joint with some vegan options."}
{"text":"A fun, quirky little spot and a 4-star for what it is. I wasn't as impressed as I was hoping I was going to be, but for the price and being that it's a hot dog, it's definitely right. I don't really know how you can make a hot dog \"gourmet\" but I am assuming this is as close as it can get. I definitely don't get the hype as much as other people play it up, but I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Oh Happy Dog, how I love you and your cheap ($5) hot dogs that includes a plentiful amount of toppings.  I love how this place has vegan option that don't suck.  Field roast dogs?  YES, PLEASE!  They are on the west side but not too west far west of the river so us east siders can go there and not feel terribly guilty.  Yeah, the place is normally 75% hipsters but who gives a damn when you are eating heaven sent hot dogs."}
{"text":"So I admit, the reason I took so long to visit this place is because I once I had an internship in a bio lab where we studied food-borne infections (salmonella, etc).  Long story short, I did not have a particular urge to eat hot dogs for quite awhile afterwards.  That being said, I liked this place because you can basically cover your hot dog with so many \"toppings\" that it really no longer looks or tastes like a hot dog.  The sunny-side up egg is key, of course.  I don't think I'm ever going to eat any more hot dogs unless they have sunny-side up eggs on top.  You might have to play around with different combinations until you find one that works for you, though.  Some toppings are significantly more prominent (read: overwhelming) than others, so you need to find that perfect combination of flavors that works best for you.  The tater tots are pretty decent too.  Try the top secret fry sauce (I swear it's thousand island dressing made with white ketchup)."}
{"text":"This is what hipster feels like, but in a good way. The bar is stocked with a decent beer selection, the patrons aren't shy from trying out the orphaned pinball machines in the back, and plaid is suggested. It's dive-y enough to not care why you're there, but entertaining enough to bring you back. And, of course, the hot dogs are to die for. Bleu cheese cole slaw and garlicy escarole veggie dog, how I love thee!"}
{"text":"Happy Dog was awesome (if you can get past the hipsters)! They had a great craft beer selection with several local and draft beer selections. The wait staff/bartenders were friendly and attentive. They knew about their beers as well. The food was yummy! Loved all the topping choices and dips. Knocking 1 star off because there were only two dog choices and only a plain, standard bun. I would definitely come back and am glad we stopped here on our way through town."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, diverse entertainment, delicious hot dogs, and a never-ending list of toppings to satisfy even the pickiest of eaters. One of my favorite locations in CLE and a must-visit at least once a month."}
{"text":"it isn't too complicated: just a hot dog or taters... its the dips, toppings, and sauces that make this place one of a kind.  I opt for the taters, I love the crispy fried goodness of the tater tots, they're perfectly crunchy and golden in color.  I love piling it on the tots, with chorizo, sloppy joe, pork n beans, plus bacon, cheese and an egg!  you'll be stuffed with just the tots.  Personally, I'm not as big of a fan with the dips since I load it on the tots, but they are all very very tasty.  There's a decent beer selection, good music.  try to go for a DJ Kishka night...it'll be packed but so much fun!"}
{"text":"if u just wanna chill and get some reasonably priced drinks, this is a good place. also the hot dogs with unlimited toppings - AMAZING if you're a meat eater. tho some vegetarians have told me to avoid their vegetarian hot dog."}
{"text":"Looks like a bar, but always seems to have a cover charge like some sort of club or concert, so I didn't make it through the door on my first 4 visits. I wanted a beer way more than I wanted to hear drums & guitars. When I actually felt like having a band right by my head so I wouldn't have to talk to anyone, I headed down for another attempt at this highly reviewed spot. I read that members of the Cleveland Orchestra was doing shows there once in a while so I tried to get in early to see if I could check the schedule - they weren't there. What I did find was an overwhelming amount of hipsters. The mildly chubby people stretching the seams on some thrift store flannels, skinny jeans, and Pabst soaked mustaches made me sick.  If that's your vibe, it's probably a 5 star deal. Everyone seems to be down for the hot dogs and tater-tots though. It's also a good place for older patrons to have a beer and \"see what the kids are doing these days\" or something."}
{"text":"Great bar. The bartender was attentive and friendly. The beer selection was great, and featured brews from around the country. And most importantly- the hot dogs were awesome. I love the assortment of things you can pile on top, and the fact the hot dogs cost a flat $5 rate, regardless of the number of toppings you choose.  My personal recommendation, if you can't decide: Hot dog with chorizo chilli (not spicy, which I was relieved about), caramelized onions, brie cheese, and some fresh Spanish onions.   My only complaint would be the hours. I wish they were open until 2am every night. But I suppose I can't exactly blame them for wanting to close earlier on a slower night."}
{"text":"What an amazing little place!  The veggie dog.... Amazing!!!!  The tater tots...Perfection:) My kids had the regular dogs with various toppings and french fries; three days later they're still talking about their food.  This place is a must visit for anyone that travels to Cleveland.  There's free restaurant parking across the street but if the lot is full I'm sure you'll find a spot on the side streets.  This place is self seating so make sure to get there early if you're visiting with a large group.  Also, make sure to look for seating behind the bar.  We did not realize there were tables back there until one of the employees pointed them out to us after standing in the entrance for 15 minutes.  Make sure to ask for relish on your dog: it's the best I've ever had.  They should probably make it by the bottle:)  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Got a hot dog with fried egg and hot fries. Also came here another night for some cider ale. Music is not my cup of tea here though."}
{"text":"Happy Dog is a master class in dive bar ambiance, extreme foodie innovation, and exceptional customer service. The bar is large enough to fit a football team and outfitted with swanky red swivel stools. The hot dog/tater tot centric menu is diverse--some fifty+ toppings strong--and even includes some delectable vegan items. At $6 a dog, these puppies may seem pricey, but wait until you load them up with brie, spaghetti-o's, mustard, fruit loops, and truffle mustard. Then you'll see just how filling they are, and superbly crafted quick as can be. The bartenders are courteous, funny, and quick on the draw. Expect the PBR to really fly at you (not literally of course as that would not be pleasant unless you are a flying drink fetishist). In the basement, Happy Dog sports a second bar, where you can play arcade games, catch weekly comedy, or just escape the crowd upstairs. The art in the place--including one or two pieces by Mike Sobeck whose stuff has been featured in the Akron Art Museum--is exceptional as well, lending a class-tastic element to the otherwise semi- stark, VFW of yore vibes of the place. Overall, if you live in Cleveland or are just visiting, put Happy Dog on your list. Mondays are a great night to take a look as they have a devilishly difficult trivia night."}
{"text":"A remarkable street-corner spot that has glorious hot dogs (with tons of toppings to choose from) and fries/tater-tots (with lots of dips). The beer selection is also great.  I tried their tater tots and a hot dog--their \"suggestive wieners\" list is helpful for beginners or indecisive minds like me. The tots are, as everyone else said, perfection served on a plate: crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and brings in all of the toppings together wonderfully.  The place was packed, but the food, the service, and the experience in general made the wait (and being pushed and squeezed from all directions) well worth it. And if you can enjoy live music, scrumptious hot dogs, and wonderful company, while sipping your Guinness served by wonderful staff, what more could you want?!"}
{"text":"Uhhhhhh I have been a lifelong hater of hot dogs. So of course when I requested to go to Happy Dog after Edgewater Live, my hot dog loving sister obliged. I just really needed to finally try a place I've heard so much about! Well, let me list the why's of giving them four stars:  1) Price. So cheap! $6 hot dogs and $3 tator tots or fries with whatever toppings. 2) Location. Hole in the wall places are just my favorite. Sketchier the better.  3) \"Meat\" variety. They are so vegetarian friendly! I'm a meat eater, but I do appreciate when restaurants care to cater to as many people as possible. 4) Topping variety. When there are so many delicious toppings I always have to take a breather and remind myself that piling on everything could be disastrous. 5) Topping quality. Every single topping was prepared and tasted great. I absolutely loved my marinated crimini mushrooms, \"everything bagel\" cream cheese, and top secret fry sauce.  However, reasons why I didn't give them five stars:  1) I still don't really like hot dogs.  2) The bartender/server never asked us to sign our receipt. Pretty sure she was drunk as well (based off of additional comments/behaviors/overall confusing conversation). We had to ask them after our meal to dig up the receipt so we could sign it.  3) No live music! But that's my fault, I need to figure out their schedule for music."}
{"text":"A prime example of taking a simple concept and executing it flawlessly. Awesome beer list, great hot dogs with even better toppings, solid live music, and a laid back, attentive, and non-pretentious staff that knows it's product and what they are doing. It's refreshing to visit a upfront and non-stuffy place that executes what it promises at a good price.   Not every place needs to claim to be a 5-star dining establishment, and this place doesn't, which is simply awesome."}
{"text":"I was a little wary when I heard about the menu revamp, but I think the dog-and-potato formula works. You just have to know what you're getting into before you go. The dogs are pretty solid, but I got spoiled on Chef's Choice (which, sadly, no longer exists) dogs, so I can't rave about them, but they are beefy in both flavor and heft. I had bacon, egg, and chipotle hollandaise on mine, and the creole remoulade with my tater tots. My memory is failing as to what exactly my husband had on his, but I do know that the tomato was refrigerated, which is a huge no-no. Otherwise he enjoyed it (and his fries- not a tater tot fan).  The draft beer selection is outstanding; I had a Great Lakes Edmund Fitzgerald and a Bell's Oberon.  Overall, the topping selection for the dogs is pretty great. If you can't find something that strikes your fancy on the enormous list, you have problems.   I will say that I shan't be going back around dinnertime. The place was crawling with small children wreaking havoc on the stage when we were there. I will save my long rant about kids and bars for another medium, but suffice it to say I'll be returning after their bedtime for my next visit."}
{"text":"Can't say enough great things about this place!  It's hot dogs, tater tots, and fries with unlimited amounts of the most unthinkably delicious toppings and dipping sauces!  Plus, their beer selection is pretty decent and they often have great live music.  I also have to say I am OBSESSED with their truffle honey mustard.  I would drink the stuff if I could!"}
{"text":"Ugh... What just happened... We have been told for months that this was the place for hot dogs.. there was nowhere else like it..Hole in the wall with amazing food and live music... Being a \"eastsider\" it took us a while to get here but were so happy when we finally had a reason to venture out to this west side establishment. So we walk in and not only is the hot dog menu large, its also hamburger night with an equally large menu of toppings. Great so excited to try it we take 10 minutes going over all the options and finally get 1 hot dog and 1 hamburger each and i got regular tots and the fiance got cheesy tots.  So the service has been ok, we never expect much from dives and honestly it will never effect my rating unless there is no reason for bad service that i can tell. So after we flag down a waitress and get our food in we wait and wait. Tray of other peoples food keeps coming and not ours.. Then finally our hamburgers arrive.. Mediocre at best.. The assortment of toppings make it bearable but not what i was hoping for... Yet i have to ask another server where our hot dogs are.. Yup they were forgotten under a weak on non existent heat lamp.. How do i know... they were cold.. I try to never send food back but these were cold... but by the time i was able to flag somebody down we were half way thru them as our hunger outweighed out need for hot food.. hoping this was an off night for them and we may try the Euclid tavern just to see if the service is better, but probably wont venture out here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Love the hot dog toppings, especially the chorizo chili.   Love the beer selection. Mt Carmel is really good  Love the place, neighborhood and clientele.   The only negative is that the parking can be hit or miss."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were in Cleveland from West Virginia for the Browns game a few weekends ago and I was very excited to check this spot out. I had done my research and clearly this was the place to eat. I cant say that it lived up to my expectations. First off, we were charged a cover to come in and eat, $5 for each of us. I understand that a band was going to be playing later, but I explained that we were eating and leaving. They still charged us. Fact is that I do not know my way around the city and was starving after having not eaten in hours. So, we dealt with this ridiculous BS and ate there anyways. Our table and seat were filthy. Fine Ill deal with that as well as long as the food is as great as they say. That didnt even happen. The dogs themselves were fine, but the toppings on mine were not fresh and really just underwhelmed. Maybe it was just an off night, but when coupled with the door charge and dirty seats ad long wait, this was a complete bus. A damn shame as excited as I was and for my first time in Cleveland as an adult."}
{"text":"Man buns and vapor exhaust!!! I would have given this unusual hole in the wall maybe 4 stars had it not been for those pesky men with buns on there head, smoking vapor cigs and blowing their chemical clouds in my face while trying to eat. This place apparently didn't get the memo that the hipster movement has up and moved on a couple years ago. The service is very slow and unfriendly. As I was paying the bill I said thank you and the response from the waiter was \"yeah\".... The greasy hair and beards huddle around the bar trying to act cool while I sat there for twenty minutes waiting for someone to bring me my check. This place has a pretty cool menu and lots of unusual toppings but no one to explain or recommend anything."}
{"text":"Hot dogs, French fries, and tater tots. This is the menu at Happy Dog.  With each of these items, you can pick from a large list of toppings and sauces, ranging from mustard and sauerkraut to habanero sauce and chorizo chili.  There's no limit to how many toppings you can put onto your $5 hot dog, although some of the tastier add-ons for the fries and tater tots will cost you an extra dollar.  For people going to Happy Dog for the first time, I would recommend sticking to the kitchen recommended combinations. Not all of the toppings go together well, and you may not like your hot dog if you mix the wrong things together.  The toppings can make the bun extremely soggy, which makes it difficult to eat your hot dog without a fork.  Also, I'm not a huge fan of the sauces available for the fries and the tater tots.  In my opinion, the house ketchup is too bitter.  I feel that a lot of the other sauces are good hot dog toppings, but not great tater tot dipping sauces.   The atmosphere and unique mix of music, however, makes Happy Dog a good place to go for a beer and snack after work. Guests should be aware that this establishment has a $10 credit card minimum."}
{"text":"Super groovy place. Great music!Old school bar with some killer food. Invent your own hot dog/hamburger. Tons of toppings, sauces and condiments. I had the all beef hot dog with bacon spiked southern fried cabbage, crunchy peanut butter, everything bagel cream cheese, and grape jelly-chili sauce. One the side, I had tater tots with spaghettios and cheese. Loved it all!!"}
{"text":"For the price, I can't complain.  $5 for a hot dog with as many toppings as your heart desires, then $2.50 more for tater tots is tough to beat.  The beer selection has everything from the cheapest of the cheap to microbrews.    As for the atmosphere, it's a little tough to know when a show or anything is going on, but there's a chalkboard up front that spells everything out.  That, and they always run an ad in Cleveland Scene, which is everywhere.  The service can get slow when the bar gets busy, but that's nothing outlandish at all.    I wouldn't say it's an exclusively hipster place, though, and I don't think it would ever go that direction.  The whole restaurant is about having fun."}
{"text":"Loving the menu changes with new topping options, and despite past confusion as to whether or not the buns were vegan (and some snarky responses on social media explaining that the joint doesn't specify what is vegan because there's too many varieties of vegan) lo and behold they have a separate veg menu now!   Fave toppings include: garbanzo bean chilli, chipotle ketchup, pimento mac & cheese, & momocho habanero sauce. not necessarily all on the same dog. oh and chimichurri for the tots."}
{"text":"Their hot dog choices in regards to meet are pretty simple.  All beef hot dogs or a vegan hot dog.  I figured if you come to a place like this you shouldn't be to health conscious right?  Right.  The menu ranges from toppings of Macaroni and Cheese, Sloppy Joe, Froot Loops, Caribbean Cole Slaw, and/or Jamaican Jerk Seasoning just to name a few.  Do you want to know the best part of these hot dogs?  All of the toppings are FREE!  You know how much I love FREE things?  Name me what you love the most and why, and I'll debate you with the word FREE.  Of course, not all free things are good, but you can't go wrong when you have a plethora of options to put on your hot dog.  Two hot dogs were ordered.  The first hot dog of choice was an all beef hot dog with Bacon-Spiked Southern Greens, Nacho Cheese, Marinated Cremini Mushrooms, and Jamaican Jerk Mustard.  This hot dog taste like it was made with love, forgiveness, and matrimony.  Okay, I'm going a bit overboard but this hot dog was absolutely fantastic.  The greens had the right amount of seasoning and weren't too soggy, the nacho cheese was hot, the mushrooms were sautéed correctly, the egg was perfectly cooked sunny side up, and the Jamaican jerk mustard was the perfect topping on this beautiful dog.  Words can NOT express how well this dog was, and even though it was falling apart as I was biting into it, nothing could stop me from putting it back together like nothing happened. The second dog that was ordered was a Hot Dog garnished with Bourbon Baked Beans, Caramelized Onion, Alien Relish, Vodka Sauerkraut, and Jamaican Jerk Mustard. OH. MY. GOODNESS. The bourbon baked beans tasted like the guy with the dog in the commercial was back in the kitchen making them.  They really packed the right amount of spices with the baked beans and the alien relish set it over the top.  The vodka sauerkraut was a little tart but worked well with the other sweet and hot flavors.  This dish was anything short of spectacular. Last but not least I had to get some kind of potatoes to go with the dog, it was only right.  You have options of fries and/or tots.  It's been so long since I've had tater tots that it brought me to my grade school days when you would have tator tots with the dry pizza that public school provides you.  Hey, it kept you alive right?  Well, sometimes.  I ordered the tator tots with sloppy job and cheddar cheese.  I figured if we're going back to school, we might as well make the whole dish a grade school dish.  The sloppy joe was amazing.  It had just the right amount of peppers in it and it wasn't too \"sloppy\".  It was full of flavor, seasonings, and consistency."}
{"text":"Such a unique spot to go to. Tried a hot dog with peanut butter and it was awesome!"}
{"text":"I give this three stars mostly from a vegetarian perspective- meat eaters may think much differently.   Pros-having a vegan/vegetarian selection at all, laid back atmosphere, friendly staff, good beer selection, nice choices of hot dog toppings.   Cons-overcrowded most nights and can't get a table (tried four times previously, all different week nights) which is GREAT for the establishment. The vegan dog is not a dog at all, it's a faux sausage. And there is no dog option. Sausage mixed with all the hot dog toppings just doesn't always work. And the actual sausage product is mediocre. I ended up cutting off the ends of my second \"hot dog\" to avoid eating anymore. Visitors-consider this as well, $5 may sound cheap in theory, but realistically, you need to factor in most people eat two ($10), tots/side ($3), and a beer or two, and you've got yourself a $20+ meal vegan hot dog mediocrity.   Would I return? Eh... Maybe if a friend REALLY wanted to try the place out and there were actually seats, but I wouldn't recommend it as a first choice for a vegetarian or vegan visitor.   For what it's worth, it's a great neighborhood bar with a lot of fans."}
{"text":"Very nice retro style place. Friendly staff friendly people and vegetarian options are available.  This place also hosts concerts, and civic events posted on 90.3.  If you want to have fun and eat good food and a good selection of Beers on tap.  This is the place."}
{"text":"Vegan hot dog from heaven! Absolutely the best veggie dog I have ever had. My hubby said the regular dog was stellar as well. The menu is tiny: hot dog, veggie dog, tots, fries but the huge number of sauces and toppings are what make this place a star. There are lots of  free dipping sauces to choose from like chipotle hollandaise, garlic aioli, mole', sriracha, house made ketchup ( i will scan the list later for you).  It seems like you can choose as many sauces as you want.   The atmosphere is good, they have music at night and cool bartenders. They had 15 or 20 tap beers many of which were good craft varieties. The prices are really fair for the very good quality of food and drink. I wish this place was in New York so I could become a regular!"}
{"text":"Never been here after 10pm, but very relaxed atmosphere.  The dogs are quality and BIG. The variety of toppings transforms one item into a limitless combination of flavors. Never had a bad dog yet, and I like to do some random combos. I dig the blue cheese coleslaw... at least I think that's what I'm tasting, haha.  I will be back, with friends."}
{"text":"My order was wrong the first time it camw. My toppings for two hot dogs came on one. The waitress was really good about fixing our order. She took the hot dogs off the bill which was not by any means necessary. We left her a nice tip for her efforts and to cover the hot dogs."}
{"text":"Friends picked this place out for a meet up while in town for Christmas. I didn't know what to expect coming here. It's basically a bar that serves food. Hot dogs and hamburgers. You pick from a large variety of toppings to make your own hot dog. It would have been nice if they had suggestions of toppings that go well together since the list was so large and some things were bizarre. Alas, I created a hot dog and it was pretty tasty. It was off putting that the bun was cold. Like ice cold. Weird. The tater tots and dipping sauces were amazing! May I suggest Buffalo! :) They do have a pretty decent beer selection, draft and bottles. This place is dark, divey, dingy, and feels like a college bar. I'm not mad we came here and we all had a great time, but I would not be mad if I never came here again."}
{"text":"I came to town for Sweet Moses ice cream, but since you shouldn't just eat ice cream for lunch, I decided to stop at Happy Dog first. I am so glad I did! There are over 50 toppings to choose from and they have a list of recommended combinations. The best part: all hot dogs are $5 so you can go nuts with the toppings! I tried the Mediterranean dog which comes with feta, garlic aioli, onions and garlicky escarole. It was fantastic! I never would have thought to put these toppings on a hot dog, but now I wish more places did! My fiance tried the Chicago Dog and tried one topped with mac and cheese and pork and beans. Everything was delicious. They also had a great list of beers, I would love to come here at night sometime. The atmosphere feels like a dive in the best way possible and the service was friendly and quick."}
{"text":"If I lived any closer to Happy Dog I would be in danger of going there everyday. I've been here several times and it has quickly become one of my favorite spots.   For $5 you get a hot dog (or vegan sausage) with unlimited toppings from their mouthwatering toppings menu. With a plethora or homemade sauces, chilis, beans, etc. you'll be tempted to just order everything on the menu but try to limit yourself. Don't worry about picking the perfect combination, the menu is made as though you cannot choose wrong.  One hot dog of endless toppings is more than enough to fill you up but it wouldn't be a proper trip to the Happy Dog without an order of tots (again with however many homemade sauces you are willing to try). And if there's a topping you were too afraid to get on your hot dog now is the time to try it.   As if all of that weren't enough, Happy Dog also has a pretty decent beer selection.   Be Aware: They also have live music quite frequently and if you get there after 8:30 on one of these nights they do charge a cover and it will be very loud."}
{"text":"I'm a bit biased for this one: I haven't been a fan of hot dogs since I saw Ralph Nader speak as a teenager [sorry, Paulius].  That said, I like what they do.   A lot already has been said about the place. I've been here three times. The crowd is a mix of hipsters, old folks, regular, suburban families, and white blue-collar workers.   The service: Last Friday, the service was good, considered the seating was 90% capacity. The workers were like drone bees and they never stopped working while I was there. I applaud them for that, though I wondered once or twice if they could have had another one behind the bar.  One time on a friday during their happy hour [4-7 pm, $1 off domestics], they had country (old stuff like Hank Williams) playing in background instead of polka.   The food: On one visit they gave my order without the correct toppings, but returned with a correct one within 2 minutes. I didn't read the reviews before coming here, but note that the vegetarian dog is sausage-like in its texture and taste which I didn't care for. The tots don't taste oily.   There's great beer selection, over 20 micros (probably about 10 on draft) and over 10 domestics [even Ballantine, I've only seen it here and at Prosperity] as mentioned. The prices, beer wise, are average for the Cleveland area.   Note, it can be difficult to hold a conversation if there's live music playing.   [review #100. Duffman says oh yeah!]"}
{"text":"This place has simplicity of a hot dog shack with a great atmosphere. Check off what you want on your dog and they'll make it so. Nice beverage selection to boot."}
{"text":"Very good food. Fair price. Lots of topping options. The decor is a little too bar-ish for me but I am sure others would enjoy it. The night I went a band was there and I didn't stay long."}
{"text":"happy dogs are here  hot dog extravaganza  tater tot tail wag.    Cool,cool,cool. Lot's of beer, live music, a Friday Polka Happy Hour! Young and hip crowd, Dogs with 50 hot dog toppings. FIFTY! ...but no char-dogs... boo hoo...  Actually, the hot dogs are good. Kinda big, so you can't eat two and really get into the garnishes. The meat itself has that nitrate filled goodness that only mechanically separated meat products can provide. A bit salty, I'd give 'em a solid \"7\", but if they were charred, a \"9\" would be within reach. And yes. There are tater tots deep fried to a golden, amber like crust.  Crunchy on the outside, for excellent ketchup retention.  Carry on."}
{"text":"Very good hot dog joint. Also a great dive bar with good beer options. There's a lot of character in this Gordon Square favorite. Locals love it and people make the trip to this bar, as it's known for its crazy hot dog combinations."}
{"text":"I had never heard of this bar/restaurant before I had been invited to go, so I didn't have many expectations. When I walked in, I wasn't expecting much - It looked like every other neighborhood bar I'd ever been too. But the food and the kindness of the staff made up for it. I had a hot dog with tillamook cheddar, chorizo chili, sriracha sauce and caramelized onions and I honestly think it was one of the best hot dogs I've had. We tried 5 different sauces for the tater and they were all unique and great! I would definitely go back again. The only reason I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 was that the restaurant was unbearably hot (It is July) and the decor wasn't the greatest."}
{"text":"Why isn't their a place like this in Brooklyn??   For $17, we both got a veggie-dog, a beer and fries to share. God bless America. My husband is a bore, and doesn't like tater tots, so I was forced to oogle the neighboring tables. The BBQ sauce is insane. The spicy-stuff is no joke; its spicy. However, the housemade ketchup wasn't for me.    The interior of this place is so rad, nice and open, friendly staff, the appropriate lighting one would want while shoving a peanut-butter-topped dog in their mouth.  Happy Dog will surely be a pit-stop for us any time we're cruising along 80."}
{"text":"This place was awesome. Yes, it's a bit hipstery, but that should deter you. I was a little worried that I'd gone overboard with the toppings, but my dog came out nicely balanced and delicious. Everyone I was with got something different, and we were all really impressed with our hot dogs. Before we ordered, we'd debated getting 2 dogs apiece, and let me tell you, I am so glad we didn't. We'd have exploded.  Those tots are outstanding, and I love the selection of house-made dipping sauces.   We tried their house-brewed peanut butter cup coffee porter, which was really yummy and awesome.   Loved everything about this place. Will say that the beef gravy was kind of really salty, but other than that everything was out of this world."}
{"text":"The Happy Dog rocks!! You can't beat a vodka and soda for $4, plus a hot dog and tots all for under $8. There are so many different sides to choose from, its almost overwhelming. I tried the vegan dog, and it did not disappoint. I topped it with some blue cheese coleslaw and chipotle ketchup... YUM!!  There is almost always a wait here, so be prepared!! You can always get lucky though. We had a group of 4 and only had to wait about 5 minutes on a Saturday, but that almost never happens! It is absolutely worth the wait though!"}
{"text":"Maybe my arm tat wasn't showing enough the day the bartender added an extra $10 to my already 20% tip."}
{"text":"Always a great time at the happy dog! Good atmosphere, awsome beer selection, and it's always a plus when local band Shit-box Jimmy is playing. Can never go wrong with a place with great dogs and music!"}
{"text":"Happy Dog is crazy in all the best ways. You make the food what you want it to be. Your hot dog can be all business (ketchup, onions, mustard), all fun (fruit loops, fried eggs, wasabi peas) or a gourmand's dream (brie,, black truffle honey mustard, Momocho's habanero sauce). The tater tots are pure nostalgia but the dipping sauces are just amazing. Did I mention the great variety of good beer?  My only complaint: once the band starts playing, all conversation end. The space is small. The ceiling is low. The bands love to get very loud. On busy nights, the problem only gets worse as everyone in the bar thinks they can talk over the band.  So, get there before 7 or 8pm when the band starts to play and layer on as many delicious flavors onto your hotdog as you can stomach - I promise you will enjoy even the strangest combinations."}
{"text":"This may be one of the best culinary ideas I've ever seen. It's just so simple! Take an all-American dish and throw a bunch of junk on it for a reasonable price. It's brilliant and delicious.  First of all, I love a \"seat yourself\" establishment. For some reason we always get stuck next to the rowdy party on date night and spend half the meal staring at each other since it's too loud to talk. So we were able to nab a quite table near the kitchen and thus began our jaw dropping experience. There's just so much to choose from! A whole list of toppings with a dietary chart to boot. We honestly had no idea where to start.   Second, the waitress brought us extra napkins right when we sat down which is awesome when dining on messy foods.  Lastly, I can't believe the amount of food I received for such a little price. I topped my hot dog with sautéed onions, bacon-balsamic marmalade, feta cheese, chorizo chili, and a fried egg. It was absolutely delicious! I mean, who knew?! All that stuff piled on a hot dog being that good. Oh and did I mention all that was $5? That's right, $5. We also got a side of tater tots with 3 dipping sauces for $3. Crazy! Usually, the bill we ended up with is what we would pay for one meal, not two.  This is definitely a place I would recommend for an \"out of towner\". Very fun and a Cleveland gem."}
{"text":"WHY THEY DESERVE MORE THAN 5 STARS I LOVE this place! It caters to no one, everyone is welcome at the Happy Dog and everyone loves it, because everyone loves a hotdog - even vegans love this joint because their vegan sausage dog is ah-maze-balls. They have plenty of topping options. You will never want to eat a plain dog with just ketchup ever again! Their food is cheap and good!  Descent Service, they do their best to be speedy but, this place can get crowded! Friendly Staff, always willing to tell you their fave toppings. Awesome Beer Selection! Extremely Affordable! Welcoming, Non-Pretensious, Divey, Hipstery, Welcoming, Music-Driven Atmosphere - Fun for everyone! One of the BEST places in CLE to check out local music.  Here's a tip if you have sensitive ears bring ear plugs because this place gets loud! :)"}
{"text":"Eh. It's okay. It is very inexpensive, so its good for the prices. The hot-dog-to-bun ratio is off. The have a huge variety of toppings for your hot dogs, so you get to be very creative. The owner of momocho's and el carnicero also owns this place, so I would expect the hot dogs to be better than what they are. This place was awesome to go to before Dyngus Day Cleveland became so popular, but now on Dyngus Day you can't even walk inside, it's so packed :( If I want to grab a quick inexepensive bite to eat somewhere I would go here, but otherwise...ehhh."}
{"text":"Vegetarian hot dogs available!   The scene at Happy Dog was not what I had expected - a bit of a dive bar (dark/old style bar & restaurant scene) - likely because they invest in awesome food, drink and staff instead of ambiance - and I am totally cool with it!  It's make your own hot dog style - like Barrio for tacos, with loads of amazing options.  Same for tots (which were freaking amazing).  Super reasonably priced, around $10 for hot dog & tots, and you get a ton of food for your $$.  Well supplied bar & beer menu as well.  We ordered food to go and ate at Edgewater Beach nearby."}
{"text":"Happy Dog: Please get the smokers away from the doors, vents, and HVAC!  Otherwise we all leave the bar stinkin' and wheezin' like it's pre-2006.  Aside from that, this bar is classy and casual, cozy and spacious, simple yet busy with things to do.  The beer list is quite robust but not laughably long.  (Looking at you, Winking Lizard.) Good for a date but be sure to sit far from the door in the wintertime. Love the intimacy of a wrap-around counter.  There's parking a-plenty and a huge turnout when they host the \"Keep Talking\" storytelling show."}
{"text":"Took the kids and they loved this place. It's dark, divey and unfussed with CLE.   We sat ourselves and began working on picking toppings and dipping sauces. Giggles all around when the kids saw fruit loops. They had Mac & cheese, spaghetti-ohs and bacon. I decked mine out breakfast style and had a nice light beer.   The server was great and no complaints about the food from any of the kiddos."}
{"text":"I've had my first experience with Happy Dog recently and I came away very impressed by the food.  They only serve hot dogs, tater tots, and fries and they are all very good. The tater tots were def. better than the french fries if you have to choose.  With over 50 toppings for the hot dogs there is no limit to what you can come up with. They also had an outstanding beer selection of local craft beer and nationally known brands.  The only thing I can nit pick about it the service.  The food took a little longer than I would have liked.  The staff also didn't seem to be that happy to be working on a weekend when it was so nice outside, which I could hardly blame them.  The prices are also a little steep at 5 bucks per hot dog which isn't all that bad considering they don't charge extra for toppings but if you only want a plain dog you might think it is too much. All in all I would def. recommend paying a visit sometime soon.  It was definitely delicious!"}
{"text":"Stopped in last night after the First Yelp Elite Party for a hot dog and couple beers, boy was this place NOT what I expected.  This does fall into the GOOD WAY category.   The bar was completely full and the band was just starting up.  Thankfully we were able to get our food, eat, and finish our drinks before the band started because they were loud....I mean can't talk to your friends loud.  The band was good though, caught myself head bobbin to the music on multiple occasions.  I love the fact that this place only has hot dogs, both vegan and regular.  Who turns a huge bar into just a dog joint?!?  It's obviously working and is getting fantastic reviews.  I would absolutely love a place like this in my neighborhood.  Personally I went with a 'recommended' slew of toppings topped off with a fried egg.  I was pleasantly surprised the texture and flavor the egg added to the whole dog.  I would have preferred my hot dog to be a little warmer but that's not saying much coming from a guy who ate raw hot dogs as a kid.  C'mon, they are fully cooked already....right..Ha.  Bonus for me, if the hot dog wasn't enough, TOTS!!  Loving the tot comeback except here you can pick dipping sauces....yum.  Mine were supposed to come with cheese on top but they were good without.  My friend got the vegan hot dog and he said it tasted like burnt soy, I never tasted it, so I can't comment.  Great selection of beer, lots of taps, HUGE bar, and good food.  What more can you ask for?  Please don't say chicken wings ;)"}
{"text":"This place goes immediately from a 3 to a 5  - star rating the day they get Vienna Beef hot dogs. Simple as that. The toppings are great, the tots are fun, beer selection awesome. But yes, it's THAT important. When you could be serving the best dogs in the world and you choose not to even offer them as an option, I don't really get it. Get the Vienna's in there and we'll be in there every week guaranteed. As it is, it's ok but just could be SO much more."}
{"text":"It's not the hotdogs that are so great, its the ridiculous amount of toppings that you can get. I will never eat tater totes without Gouda on them ever again. Oh and I love their chutney as a side.  All of their toppings are made from scratch, including the ketchup :)   The only downfall is it's dive bar atmosphere.  That parts not really for me."}
{"text":"Im more a hamburger guy but you can't go wrong the combination of toppings The Happy Dog offers. There's something for everyone. Use your imagination but be careful not to over do it. Only downfall of the place is its size."}
{"text":"people either love it or hate it. hot dogs with many toppings (or all if you want). live music. an old neighborhood bar revived as a hipster and wannabe-hipster hangout. like it a lot."}
{"text":"I never went here as I was always scared that the hipsters with tattoos would beat me up. Then one day, in my fancy work suit, I told myself I'd be the outcast because dang it, I wanted a hot dog. Best decision I ever made. If you're a vegetarian, I highly recommend trying this spot as well--- the veggie dog is delicious in its own way. Build your own dog with tots on the menu. Yes my friends, tots. I personally prefer cheesy fries but who's to judge? I usually have a hard time finding a seat during peak hours--- if you're comfortable eating at the bar, that's usually where my friends and I end up eating. A must for all Cleveland tourists."}
{"text":"Happy Dog is amazing. Love the dive-y atmosphere, love the music, love the staff, considering proposing marriage to the tader tots. I can't wait to go back so I can try more of the delightful and ingenious toppings."}
{"text":"AOK. Exactly what i thought about here. I had a good time. My bourbon pour was pretty nice and they had two options for dark beers on draft!  I am not a fan of country music, however, so the live band did little for me! The crowd was nice though! They also had tvs set up, though they werent HD it seems and they werent properly set up so i had to check my phone to find out the score of the hockey game as i watched it. I didnt get to try a hot dog, but wish i could have had some space in my stomach to do so! Looked like great dogs.  So...i dont want to discourage anyone from coming here, so i will put a 4, but for me, really, it was a 3 experience"}
{"text":"Great Hotdogs.and Service but the best thing was they had Crooked Tree IPA from the Dark Horse Brewery in Marshall Michigan"}
{"text":"I visited Happy Dog with my father for Father's Day. The tater tots are to die for, and the restaurant has all kinds of cool toppings for hot dogs. The restaurant also has some cool local bands play every once in a while. Would definitely recommend checking it out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Wow, really good stuff. Great draft beer list and of course a wide selection of dog toppings. I did one dog buffalo (wing sauce + bleu cheese slaw) and another chili (with pepper jack, pickles, and mustard) and they did not disappoint. Generally, when people talk about one actual hot dog being better than another, I sort of roll my eyes, it's all just hot dogs, but the meat itself on these was absolutely great - big and juicy and perfect.   Also I apparently happened into some sort of happy hour (I was there pretty early on a Tuesday) of which I was unaware, because my two hot dogs (shown as two on the receipt, so I don't think it was an error) came to only $5. Haven't seen any mention of this on other yelp reviews, but if this wasn't an error, it's a great deal!"}
{"text":"Ahhhh......The Happy Dog. Here's the deal people. You have to know what you're getting into when you come into this place. If you've never been here, experience it. If you've been here before and hated it, don't come back. For those that haven't been here, this is what you can expect. Beards, trucker hats, skinny jeans, tattoos, dark rimmed glasses, pea coats, knit caps, chain wallets, Vans sneakers, suspenders, wool sweaters, etc...... The service? It's good. Well, it's hipster good. Like I said above, you have to know what you're getting into here. It's definitely NOT Applebee's with a pushy, pimple faced 19yo girl asking \"How's everyone doing todaaaaaaay!!!!!\". If you don't get a drink right away, just do your coolest hipster wait and it will come. The food? It's good. Well, it's hipster good. It's hot dogs and tater tots. They're made well, pretty cheap and come out relatively fast. Mortons Steak House? Um, no. This is not it. The food is pretty good though.   They run out of beers occasionally (which is wayyyyyy hipster cool, btw) but show me a place that doesn't. I like this place. I really do. It's all about expectations. If you go in with the hopes of a world class experience, you will probably be let down. If you go in wanting to have a hot dog, drink a beer and get your inner hipster on, I think you'll love it. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan! There is a vegan hot dog option on the menu! The toppings list seems endless and the tater tots are delicious!!! There is usually a couple people behind the bar, so quick refills on beer and water. I've never been to the Happy Dog for music but I've been there a couple times for their science lecture: Life, the Universe and Hot Dogs. I always take my out-of-town visitors here."}
{"text":"I just wanted to put it out there that I cracked the code to the best hot dog.  I've been to happy dog more than a handful of times, and I always get so excited by all of the choices that when my dogs comes it's covered in a huge pile of 6-8 ingredients and sauces that don't go together. It's still good, just not great.   Remember this rule- three toppings....4 max. 1 sauce. I started using this rule of thumb and these hot dogs have quickly become my favorite.   Last time I went I had a dog with pimento Mac and cheese, blue cheese slaw, and bacon. And secret fry sauce as well.  It was so good, and I could still pick it up (a plus).   The hot dogs are an awesome deal, but your tab will run up quickly from the beer prices!"}
{"text":"We stopped here for a late dinner on a drive through Cleveland and it was AMAZING. Delicious. Perfect. Yes.  Also, do you realize you can literally put an unlimited amount of toppings on your hot dog and it still only costs $5?   We did fries with nacho cheese and sloppy joe... A 1:45am Special (basically breakfast on a hot dog) ... And a Mobile Home-Wrecker (BBQ-y happiness).   Really cool vibe, live music, a full bar... If we find ourselves in Cleveland again, we'll be back."}
{"text":"The possibilities are endless. I personally don't like pork/beef hot dogs, but they have a better option: Vegan Italian sausages!!! 50+ toppings and only $5!!! Plus the fries/tots have 20 some dippers to choose from $3?!?! Are you kidding? I have never been there for live music but I follow them on Facebook and they get some great local and touring bands. I love to stop up here anytime I'm in Cleveland for a concert or sporting event. Friendly knowledgeable staff and quick order times! Thanks you, will be returning over and over again."}
{"text":"Talk about a great chill place with awesome dogs and great staff!  I ordered the veggie dog and was SUPER impressed.. in fact have been craving one ever since.. great fun relaxed atomsphere.. it can however get loud if a band is playing because it is an intimate space.  Will go back there again!!! and again"}
{"text":"There isn't much that I can said that hasn't been said already, but here it goes, anyway. Years ago, when I was first being introduced to Cleveland, it was Happy Dog that made me fall in love with the city. Well, Happy Dog and West Side Market, but for similar reasons. It doesn't matter who you are, what you look like, how much money you make, or where you're from - Happy Dog is the place to be. Sure, it's \"hipstery,\" but not in an exclusive sort of way. On any given day, you'll see the stereotypical \"hipster,\" but you'll also see a couple people in suits, some people who looks like your grandparents, a lot of normcore people, and the occasional rough & tumbley group. Everyone loves a wiener, and Happy Dog loves everyone. Just...just go. Don't wait. Go now. Happy Dog is love. Happy Dog is life."}
{"text":"The Happy Dog was another \"Best Thing I Ever Ate\" spot, and also a Michael Symon recommendation. This time, though, we didn't get his favorite menu item of hot dog toppings - peanut butter, Sriracha, and relish. Firstly, the menu is really fun - pick your toppings and sauces on a nice checklist, and hand it over to the bartender.   To share: fries and tater tots His plate: hot dog with mustard, pickle, vodka sauerkraut, and more mustards on the side Her plate: hot dog with caramelized onions and Jamaican jerk mustard mojo  Overall, the sauces were really good, but we were underwhelmed by everything else. These are steamed hot dogs, and we would've probably loved this food if they'd been grilled. The steamed texture and lack of grill flavor was just not appealing after a bite or two, not to mention that they cooled down super quickly. The tater tots were too greasy, and tasted too much like fryer oil."}
{"text":"I'm just glad I came during the day...  Pulling up with my girlfriend at about 6:30, we were a little taken aback by how crappy the area was. Every city has their armpits, and this area may well be one of Clevelands -- I don't quite have the kahunas to come around this area at night, so I'm glad the sun was still high.  Alright, so anyway... walking in, the place is a total dive. Smells a little musty, the building's a little small, there might be a little mold on the walls... hey man, it's all good. In my experience, the dumpier a place appears, the better the food is. I mean, it's not a RULE by any means, but it's something I tend to live by.  The menu is extensive -- not in food options, but in topping options. Coming in here, you get two options: dogs or tots. If you haven't looked at any of Yelp's pictures for Happy Dog yet (you know ya did ya lil' bastard), you'll see just how massive the list of toppings is here. You could spend all day trying to dream something up, but I just winged it and checked off some of the first few things I saw to come up with my own brilliant dog:  Beef dog Chorizo chili Pimento mac 'n cheese \"Alien\" relish Black truffle honey mustard Fried egg  Bom-chicka-wah-wah! As good as it sounds (and looks... see: picture). The alien relish I assume is called that because it's neon green. I may have imagined it, but it also seemed spicy -- that could have been coming from something else though. Either way, that stuff was a lot of what \"made\" my concoction.  The other dog I got was the East Meets West ... I was too intrigued by the idea of peanut butter on a hot dog not to try it. Turns out, it's pretty decent. The thing is though, against the dog I came up with, it just wasn't as good ... then again, it was an entirely different sort of flavor. I'd recommend it to those adventurous enough to go for peanut butter on swine, but not quite wild enough to go for artificially flavored circular fruit cereal on it -- eek.  The tots were alright -- I got them with just bacon and nacho cheese on them (the cheese was forgotten, but we got it on the side after wards without issue). The jerk honey mustard and chipotle hollandaise dipping sauces were both tasty little accoutrements.   I'm gonna go and say the one thing that made me a little sad about Happy Dog is that the IPA I ordered was a month past its best by date ... it still tasted fine, but it definitely didn't taste as hoppy as it normally would have. Old beer in a bar? Not okay. Shorten your beer list if you aren't moving enough -- especially if it's IPAs. Minus 3/4 of a star for that.  Get ready for me to be petty to the max with this next bit -- minus 1/4 of a star for the fact that I couldn't bring myself to visit this place at night. I admit it, I'm a pansy -- this place is just creepy enough during the day that I can't imagine it being anything short of terrifying for my thumb sucking self to visit at night.  Happy Dog on the whole is a bitchin' place that does what they do extremely well -- hot dogs. The bar part? Whatever ... maybe it was just a fluke, but I can't excuse a bar selling \"old\" beer. I'm certain that I wouldn't have gotten any crap if I pointed it out to any of the workers (everyone seems laid back), but I just went with the flow and decided to bitch about it on the internet instead... how white of me, huh?  Anyway, can't really recommend Happy Dog enough for any hot dog lover. An awesome option in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Awesome Bloody Mary and even more awesome Hot Dogs. If I lived here, I'd go once. A week. Toppings ranging from house made \"alien relish\" to spaghetti o's to peanut butter to pimento Mac and cheese. Totally unique and awesome."}
{"text":"This place is unique and fun. My boyfriend and I went here with another couple right before the Indians game for some beers, tots, and hot dogs. The sauces you can order are memorable. Make it fun and order a bunch! I enjoyed their tater tots but only because of the sauces. Besides that, they weren't too memorable. They have an excellent beer selection and their hot dogs are unique. Give this place a try and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Happy Dog was one of the first to open in the city during what I've come to know as a sort of culinary renaissance for Cleveland. Don't let the appearance fool you-- when you cross the threshold of Happy Dog, you should get ready for some awesome service, great food, and one of the best beer lists in the city. The menu is do-it-yourself; you choose what kind of sausage you want (1/4 pound hot dog or vegan italian sausage; both excellent) and whatever you can imagine to put on top of it. They have some preconstructed suggestions on the menu, but you can take your pick of the 50 ingredients in whatever combination you want. Everything is excellent quality and a lot of it is local. I recommend peanut butter, momocho habanero sauce, and peanut butter (made in house). Bacon, egg, kimchi, and chow mein is another good one. Honestly, it's hard to go wrong. Pretty much anything you throw at them is going to come out excellent. The fries are good (tots are better), but they don't stand up to the rest of the menu. You can get whatever you want as a side for your fries as well.  Bottom line? Happy Dog is the best place on the west side for great food on a budget. The atmosphere is divey, but it's clean, and the service is great. Check their schedule to see when you can catch some awesome live music as well."}
{"text":"Just got into Cleveland and saw good reviews for this place so decided to give it a try. Veggie dogs are delicious. So many good topping choices. Tots are ridiculous - wish I had gotten my own order and not shared with my boyfriend... Highly recommend!! Oh the michigan beers on tap were a plus :)"}
{"text":"I doubt I will ever go back, but I have to give Happy Dog 3 stars anyway. It's one of those local restaurants with too much character to pass up. They have tons of unique toppings and combinations. Heck, they even have live entertainment... often on the eclectic side. I would give them 5 stars (and eat there again) if they had more than 2 options for the most important part of the menu - the hot dog.   Happy Dog has always had a limited menu and I have no problem with that. I actually think it's ideal. Problem is that I can't eat beef and I'm not really into vegan sausage. They don't offer chicken, turkey, or pork hot dogs or sausages and almost everything else on the menu is essentially an accessory to the hotdog. Every time I have eaten at Happy Dog, I ended up eating tater tots for dinner. Needless to say, that wasn't exactly fulfilling.   I think it's reasonable to expect that they offer multiple meat options for the most important item on the menu. Even 3 options - beef, turkey, and vegan - would meet the needs of most people who don't eat beef but aren't really down with vegan sausage. If you like beef or vegan sausage, you'll likely experience Happy Dog as a 4 or 5-star experience, depending on how much you enjoy the ambiance. The rest of the menu is great.   I'll update my review if I learn that they have addressed my primary complaint."}
{"text":"Not much to say, they have enormous hot dogs with hundreds of topping options and their tater tots are really good too. The sauces are awesome- try the grape jelly chile sauce and garlic aioli. The best part is you can get as many toppings as you want and the price doesn't change!"}
{"text":"I love the regular hot dogs at the normal happy dog locations.  Obviously things would need to change for a ball park to expedite service, but there were only 3 pre-made dogs and that was a bit boring. It took away from the fun of making your own with a million different toppings. The stand will be something fun and different."}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't already been said? They hot dogs are incredible and the toppings are top-notch (pun intended). I had the all beef dog with chunky peanut butter, Saracha and applewood smoked bacon. It was awesome. I also had the vegan sausage with Jamaican Jerk Mustard sauce, Cramini mushrooms and sautéed onions. It was just as excellent. The atmosphere is laid back and has a dive bar feel to it, especially when there's a live band playing. All in all, it's a great time and I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Love Happy Dog!  They have a great beer selection (including Downtown Willoughby's Peanut Butter Coffee Porter on draft!), awesome hotdog toppings, friendly staff, and great music (shout out to Polka happy hour with DJ Kishka).  I always have a hard time choosing what toppings to add to my vegan dog and normally pick the first 8-10 that come to mind.  No matter how many you choose, it's only $5!    This is one of my favorite places to take my out-of-town friends when I want to show them how awesome Cleveland is!"}
{"text":"What a concept!!! I LOVE and have a complete adoration for hotdogs. May sound weird but it started in college as a late night bar snack and now it's just an obsession. That being said - I tried to go to happy dog a few weeks ago around 1:30 and they said the kitchen was closed even though their posed hours say the kitchen is open until 2am. I reallly do not like when places close before their posted hours. It's not like the place is in the middle of the action. Regardless, about a week later I went back during normal dinner hours.   The \"menus\" are cute checklists where you select what you want on a hotdog. They range from the ordinary to the very crazy. I chose to go with mac'n'cheese, \"everything bagel\" cream cheese, bacon, and Momocho's Habenero hot sauce. HOLY ----!!!! It was delicious --- however almost inedible toward the end due to the concentration of hot sauce (my own fault). They also have suggested combinations if you are a hot dog novice. Lively atmosphere. I know they have live music as well (did not catch that). And their tots were delish! Fun experience with lots of beers to choose from. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Sadly I didn't even try the food, because the customer service standard ruined it! I stopped in a little after 1:30pm today (March 1, 2015). My son was just born, and we got out of hospital, and I finally had the chance to try this place that I was wanting to try for a while. I was excited to try the Happy Dog Restaurant  I saw on tv. There was probably a few tables of people, and some people at the bar. I noticed there was no waiter to take order or seat me, so I sat at the bar. A few seconds later a guy with red hair and a short red beard came over and placed a coaster and said \"Hello.\" I saw the coaster (which I thought he assumed I wanted a drink) and replied \"Oh, I wanted to order a couple hot dogs to go.\" He said in a sarcastic tone \"Okay, whatever!\" And walked away. He walked over to another worker with longer black hair and mockingly (very mockingly) said \"I just want a couple hot dogs!\" Followed by \"I am not even going to f*cking deal with it, f*ck that!\" Now I am unsure what it was he was \"f*cking dealing with,\" but I was not in any way rude to him.  This was my first experience with a place that had looked amazing on tv, but not amazing enough to be treated like that! I walked out without ordering. I understand that you embrace individuality of the workers, and don't want the corporate vibe, but I hope that this behavior is not something encouraged by the owners. A very sad, and disheartening first experience!"}
{"text":"These hot dogs and fries are extremely overrated bar food.   Let's start with the service. From what I could tell, there were three main servers. The two that served our table were very neutral. I will say the only plus is that they kept our waters full. It was blatantly evident that they didn't like their jobs.  Now...the food. I will admit that this place has a unique and large selection of toppings. I enjoyed the checklist in which the toppings are presented. And before I go any further, I think the sauces we ordered were very good (the garlic aioli, habenero, and secret fry sauce.) But that was honestly the best part.   It's clear to us that most of these toppings (if not all of them) are easily mass produced, stored, and then just thrown onto the hotdogs. For example, we both ordered caramelized onions on our dogs... and it came out as a soggy mess. Are you kidding me? Do you know what caramelized onions even are? Oh. And they were cold. Now that I think about it, the entire meal lacked any sort of heat, besides the tator tots.   I honestly think that there's an excellent concept here... with better service and better ingredients. Right now, this is just another sports bar with \"fancy\" ingredients thrown onto hot dogs. I've had gourmet hot dogs before. This place doesn't even come close.  On a positive note, this place is very cheap. The price point is perfect for bar food, so all in all, I didn't mind it that much. I was just very underwhelmed by the food and the ambience."}
{"text":"Classic bar....great music and food....must see to get a feel of ctown...highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Tots, dogs, and all the toppings you could ever want. Does it get better than this?  Yes it does -- the service is great, they have a nice beer selection AND veggie options.  The only downside I can think of is that it's seemed drafty/cold every time I've been in there.  Definitely get the chimichurri."}
{"text":"The hot dogs and tater tots were amazing and the prices are great too. I love this place and I will continue to come back."}
{"text":"If you're a hipster you'll fit right in. Otherwise be prepared for an awkward environment that smells like cat pee. The hot dog was good but we couldn't get out of there fast enough."}
{"text":"Amazing food. I can't believe they let you pick whatever toppings you want for only 6 bucks. It's such a reasonable place. Helps that the food is amazing too. Plenty of beer on tap too (15 I think) that range from $5 to $6 bucks. Worth checking out if you're in Cleveland. And they have vegan dogs too!"}
{"text":"I think Happy Dog is good. Amazing? Eh. But good.  After hearing immense raving reviews of this place, we decided to pay it a visit.   It's a low key bar. We sat down and looked at the crazy list of things you could put on your hot dog. Peanut butter? Really? I asked the waiter what \"garlic escarole\" was. He was like, \"let me ask the chef\"..came back and stated, \"it's garlic shallots and escarole.\". Um. I didn't know how to respond. Thanks for clarifying, I suppose. haha.  The mix of stuff just sounds weird...but we ordered anyways. He got this raspberry chutney with frito chips and onions on his hot dog...it was an okay mix. I got the garlic escarole, saffron aioli, toulawook cheese, and something else.....  Want to make an interesting hot dog in a Cleveland classic? Stop on down to happy dog.. :)"}
{"text":"Have been eyeing this place since they opened about 2 years ago, and finally found the time and occasion/right people to come here with.  Love the concept of making your own hot dogs. I'm all for weird out of the ordinary combinations, and Happy Dog lets me make whatever permutation of food I want.  Toppings: Get the cucumber and kimchee pickles. They definitely add that freshness. Get the sloppy joe. This was so tasty and better than the hot dog meat itself. Get the alien relish, the garlic escarole; so tasty. Get the egg and the bacon!!! All for only $5!!!  Hot dog meat - was not a big fan because it tasted like bratwurst.   Tater tots - tasty, but nothing out of the ordinary.  Pear hard cider - very refreshing.   Was stuffed at 1 hot dog + 1/2 tater tots, but had to be a glutton and left feeling way too stuffed after 2 hot dogs.   Get here before 10pm; I think after that, if they have live bands playing, there's a cover fee."}
{"text":"Best hot dog joint I've ever been to. The bar selection is outstanding, the food is addicting, the service impeccable, and the cost just can't be beat. I've been a regular for years and that won't be changing any time soon."}
{"text":"Basically a build your own jail food joint.   Tater tots taste great and the beer selection is  expansive. Atmosphere is dark and dive bar-esce.   It fits a niche and gets the job done. No complaints."}
{"text":"Absolutely best hot dog I ever had. I think the Alien relish is overrated and don't see what all the fuss is about. I loved the sloppy joe topping and the fried egg was awesome. The sweet potato fries were just alright; next time I will try the tater tots. The black truffle mustard aioli dip was to die for. What was also great was that practically before I'd returned to my table after ordering at the bar, the server was their with my order. Even the hot dog bun was nicely crisp and toasty."}
{"text":"This place wins with its creativity! This is possibly a treand in Cleveland - every thing is \"make if your own\" with the weirdest thing in the world.  For example, I used sunny side up egg on my hot dog and some of my friends used mac and cheese. As weird as it sounds, they were very yummy.  You do have to have a rough idea of what you wanna go for, cuz otherwise you are going to be lost in their a million options and may created something that really tasted weird..  Overall, a good casual place to have some creative hot dogs that are not that expensive!"}
{"text":"Happy dog is an steady awesome place to eat a delicious, substantial hot dog meal or drink some Kentucky Bourbon Barrel ale-or do both.  The service seems uniformly good, the food is always great, each time we visit.  Being the thrifty person that I am, I appreciate that you get a $5 hotdog with your choice of about 20-30 different toppings.  From bacon spiked greens to brie cheese, to blood orange marmalade, to blue cheese cole slaw...they have \"normal\" ones too-carmelized onions, mustards, different cheeses, relish, and sauces.  Again, tons of options which I appreciate and never get sick of trying different combos.  My husband and I are not vegetarians but we opt for the veggie sausage every time because its more delicious and deceptively meat-less than any other type of meat alternative I've ever tried.  Its big.  Get the tater tots for a few extra dollars and also various toppings to choose from.  The \"dusting\" of BBQ stuff is kinda dumb; not recommended....as it sounds more exciting than it actually is.  Who knows, you might love it though.  Happy Dog has great burgers downstairs in the Under Dog on Thurs. nights.  Good and big beer selection.  We recently visited Hot Doug's in Chicago and while it was tasty, we were comparing it to Happy Dog the whole time and maybe that is a little unfair for Hot Doug's.  NOTE:  I'm not talking about the \"Chicago style\" dog, but the gourmet hot dog aspect that Hot Doug's plays up is no match for Happy Dog's exciting options, low price, and large size."}
{"text":"Yeah, Yeah they have hot dogs and tots and like a million toppings.  That's really good and interesting and we all know that.  It's hip.  That's cool, too.  Except I don't really like crowded places.  I feel like the setup here is weird, as in not really room to mingle.  I tend to always keep to my group when I'm here.   However, I went this past Monday during Trivia night and just about 1/3 the bar was full and one or two tables.  It was perfect.  I loved that night.  We all giggled together at the answers on our trivia sheet (i.e. turtle head/prairie dog, Greg Brady and Bukkake) and threw back some beers.   Good thing Mondays and Tuesdays are my days off.  I'll be back for that."}
{"text":"Most unique hot dog joint I've ever been to. Drive up to the spot and the area is kind of shady, but food is amazing. Unfortunately, there was no live music when we got there. You can add so many things to your hotdog, and some weird things like peanut butter and froot loops. I ordered a hotdog with onions, alien relish, macaroni and cheese, beans, coleslaw. One of the biggest and best hotdogs ever, had to eat with a fork. Also ordered fries and tater tots which were great. They had different dippings which was good to try. Good beer selection plus. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I love how crazy you can be with the dogs. There are just so many great, and slightly strange, toppings, bit they're all delish. The choices are endless so go wild and enjoy that delicious dog.    The tots tho."}
{"text":"We had a great dinner here tonight. The menu is quite extensive with 50 different hotdog/burger toppings. They are all build your own. They also do build your own fries/tots.   I loaded mine up with chili, man and cheese, sauerkraut, buegals, bacon, cabbage, cherry pepper relish, better cheese fondue, Spanish onions, success diced tomatoes, and black truffle honey mustard.   All of us loved our hotdogs, but the service was not very good. The food came out fast, but everyone was missing toppings. My mom had to send hers back to get the rest of the toppings and they had to remake it twice so the rest of us finished eating before she got her food. Normally I would give a lower treating for this, but they gave all four of us out meals for free.   They also have a couple of pinball machines at the back of the restaurant.   If you're looking for cheap and delicious food, this is your place. We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"By far one of my favorite places to go when visiting home.  They always have one of the best beer lists in Cleveland, interesting bands, and most importantly: the BEST hot dogs ever.  I recently moved to Chicago, and I would die to find a place like this near me.  I highly recommend going earlier in the evening, especially if it's your first time.  When bands play, it can be tricky to get a table.  You don't stand a chance eating a super messy dog if you're stuck standing! Their topping list is constantly changing. Recently I got hooked on the mac and cheese topping (for obvious reasons) and any coleslaw they have is phenomenal.  The coca cola bok choy was my old favorite but they took it off the menu :(  The one bad side: I tend to overdo it on my tot sauces so sometimes i have no idea which sauces I really like. The Top Secret fry sauce was everyone's favorite last time we went....but it's hard to tell if that's what we were actually eating..."}
{"text":"There are so many options that I don't even know where to start with. The hot dog I ordered is pretty good but not as amazing as some of the other reviews described. Need to come here again"}
{"text":"Used to LOVE this place! Service sucked tonight. Cold dogs. Attitude from servers. Very disappointing. Brought Family visiting From Virginia, After RAVING about It. Oh Well, The Beer Was Good."}
{"text":"Just want to say that as a woman who's approaching something in the later 40's... I am starting to suspect that the servers at HD might be a bit more friendly if I were 28 but looked 45, had a long beard and thick-framed glasses. Shouldn't be like that guys. Step it up and realize everyone loves you, even moms."}
{"text":"Ok, fun hot dogs, great tots, chimichurri, oh yeah.  The thing I love most about this place is the bartending staff.  One bartender in particular-- a woman with short hair and tats, always in some flannel-- is a beer genius.  Tell her what kind of beer you like and she will come up with amazing, on-point suggestions."}
{"text":"Pretty good bar down in the emergent Gordon Square area.  As stated in other reviews the core of the food menu is just a few items, with dozens of embellishments available to suit your tastes.   I'm not a drinker, but the beer selection looks to be better than average, and the vibe is relaxed, and the service was good.   Bands were playing while we were there.  Sort of a strange layout to the venue for that purpose, but it works.   You should go there."}
{"text":"Ask for Beth Marie she's HOTT and pours a great beer!  I always get the beef hot dog with peanut butter and raspberry jalapeno chutney and Coco puffs or I get a beef hot dog with blue cheese coleslaw hot sauce chili and then throw other crap on there it's only five bucks it's amazing"}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't been expounded on already? This place is awesome!!! The vegan sausage is sooooo delicious. I love Field Roast veg sausages, but mine are never that delicious when I make them at home!! Last time I went, I got my veg sausage covered in veggie chili, apple bleu cheese slaw, BBQ sauce, cheddar cheese and a sunnyside up fried egg. Perfection!!  The tater tots are delicious too, especially dipped in the housemade aioli and ketchup."}
{"text":"I guess it depends on what you are looking for.  If you are looking for a good dog that has the opportunity to have almost endless toppings you have found nirvana.  They have other stuff but dogs are their main deal.  On top of that they do have a real bar. Our waiter was very attentive.  When my son went he got the dog with fruit loops, I was not that adventurous."}
{"text":"Sweet Jesus! I found chili in Cleveland that isn't that disgusting Cincinnati-style!  Happy Dog has saved the day for this WV girl who is used to eating chili dogs (aka chili on a bun with no hot dog!)  Happy Dog is a happening place with tons of beer and hot dogs toppings. It's a small place that gets very busy - so come early or at a non-peak time to avoid the crowds. We took forever to decide on what to order on our dogs - and while we were waiting, I think we saw every possible concoction come out of the kitchen. So for those of you that are indecisive, just sit and watch - something will come by and catch your eye!  The tater tots remind me of junior high school in a good way - perfectly crispy and a serving big enough to share. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Had a great dinner with family tonight at The Happy Dog. Everyone needs to take a trip to the near west side and try this place out. This place only serves dogs but you will never look at hot dogs the same again. Tater Tots with great dipping sauces and a nice selection of beers. Trust me you will love it!"}
{"text":"I went to Happy Dog in Cleveland with my friends Kohl, Maurice, and Yabo. We all ordered hot dogs and tator tots, like adults. The food was amazing. The atmosphere was great too-- a ton of girls slowly eating hot dogs while making eye contact with me, which is totally normal for me everyday. During our meal, a group of nuns walked in, looked around, and then walked out like a colony of angry penguins. This was really confusing to all of us. In retrospect, it makes sense though, because part of being a nun means you can't put any wieners inside you. I wanted to compliment the chef, but I couldn't think of anything that didn't sound sexually suggestive (e.g. \"Your wieners taste amazing\", \"You should charge more for your wieners\", \"I'm definitely recommending your wieners to my parents\"), so we just ended up leaving. I made sure I left a big... tip. Happy Dog: Fun for your family, fun for your friends, a nightmare for nuns."}
{"text":"I randomly found this place on yelp after looking for places to eat while in Cleveland for a concert. I don't have any complaints about this place. The sauces were amazing, the hotdogs were jumbo (my fav), and the beer was all craft! I got pimento Mac and cheese, Jamaican coleslaw and bacon on my hotdog (sounds crazy) and it was perfect. The staff was great too! Our bartender gave us like 7 sauces to dip our tots in and I did not mind at all! Hallelujah hotdogs!"}
{"text":"Comfortably dirty bar.  Serves Little Kings.  Excellent."}
{"text":"I'm really not sure how this place has so many good reviews. The food here is subpar at best. I definitely know that hot dogs aren't supposed to be 5 star meals but there food had no flavor at all. I got the hot dog with sauerkraut, sloppy joe, queso sauce, and mustard. The queso sauce was clearly homemade because it tasted like nothing but water and flour. The sloppy joe had no flavor and even the sauerkraut didn't have that crisp vinegar punch to it. The \"homemade\" ketchup for the tots tasted like straight tomato paste. Definitely won't be making a trip back here"}
{"text":"I have put my anger aside. I was kicked out of here on an unfortunate night. Normally I let things roll right off. Happy Dog is a really cool, old school bar. The Elvis lamp is awesome. The pinball machines are worth going for alone. They have Willoughby Peanut Butter Cup Porter which is a great, easy drinking 5.5% ABV dark beverage. And they have that awesome picture of the smiling dog that I love so much hanging up by the staircase to the bathroom!"}
{"text":"This place is just so much fun! Happy Dog has a great beer selection, a wacky atmosphere, and some crazy-good topics for the dogs! I love the variety of sauces and dips - seriously fries just exist as an excuse for me to have condiments and their homemade sauces rock! The place can get busy and sometimes it can be hard to find a seat, but it's a Cleveland must-do! Also, check out the downstairs for a completely different vibe. Beware of events and nights with a cover charge."}
{"text":"Loved it. Loved the options. Loved that all hot dog toppings were included. People were nice. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This was the last stop on an unintentional tour of various American hot dogs for me. Before this, I went to Wurstkuche (LA), Biker Jim's (Denver), and Portillo's (Chicago).  As much as Portillo's is close to my heart, I have to say that Happy Dog was the best hot dog I ever had. I'd like to believe that it wasn't the Asian instinct screaming \"unlimited toppings, 50 to choose from?!?!\" I'm not even a mustard person, but I can still taste the perfect black truffle mustard complementing my hot dog. I got fried egg, cheddar, bacon, chorizo, pickle, and sauerkraut (maybe some more, I can't remember it was so much) on my hot dog, and man was it heavenly. If I had room, I would have loved to order another one, but one was just so damn filling. For $5, the deal is just ridiculously good.  In addition, I got the tater tots with nacho cheese on top. I tried four of their sauces... I was personally a fan of their KBBQ and Alabama-style white sauces. The tots were also probably the best tots I've ever had. Crisp to perfect, but still soft on the inside.  God, what an amazing deal for even better food.  (I will have say however, their service tends to be a little slow.)"}
{"text":"The world doesn't need another Happy Dog review, but i just went for the first time since the remodel and menu change. It's way more professional now. The central bar reminds me of the vibe at Ballantine. They kept some of the kitsch(Elvis lamp), but made it a bit more contemporary.   I had a Carlsberg on tap(flat), a Lagunita on tap(perfect) some Bud bottles and a veggie dog with truffle mustard and onions. Oh yeah, and the world famous tots. I've never been a huge fan of tots, and i'm still not. The house made ketchup is fruity and more complex than a traditional ketchup. Very good. The dog was big, sorta dry, but a good deal for the price.   Rocked out to the righteous Cleveland sounds of the New Salem Witch Hunters with fellow Yelpers. All the local rock dignitaries came out. Record shop owners, college dj's, PD reporter(not sure), other bars' bartenders and my pa. Sound was really good for a place like that. Compared to say the Beachland Tavern, where shows sound like they are being played thru an answering machine directly into your ear canal.  The scary gauntlet to the corner store? Gone. The whole block is gentrified and pretty. Standing on the corner to smoke does not seem half as bad as it did a few years ago. They just need to steal all the Grog's shows now, so i don't have to drive to stupid Coventry."}
{"text":"They have The Addams Family pinball machine.  That is all you need to know.  (ok - ok  - the hot dogs are delicious)"}
{"text":"I love hot dogs. Full disclosure, even as a kinda foodie, hot dogs rank in my top five favorite foods. I've had them everywhere that they serve them, from New York to Chicago, Happy Dog is still by absolute my favorite. The ambiance, the selection of beers the surplus of toppings.... it is hot dog nirvana. Go there and enjoy yourself!"}
{"text":"Believe the hype- the Happy Dog is THAT cool! Large bar, great beer selection, unbelievable hot dogs with unlimited and numerous toppings, and a great atmosphere in the middle of the Gordon Square district. If you haven't been to Classical Revolution every 3rd Tuesday, make a plan to go to the next one. It's a truly special experience. I've never had a bad time at the Happy Dog."}
{"text":"It doesn't get much better (in the hot dog world) than what Happy Dog offers.  I don't traditionally like hot dogs but when you add mac & cheese to anything it is damn good.  I can honestly say this place offer the best hot dogs I have ever had the chance to eat which is why I continue to visit this place on a Monthly basi"}
{"text":"Happy Dog has a sold veggie dog and so many toppings and sauces! Very affordable prices for both their dogs. I liked their fries more than tater tots, but both were good. Sometimes they may have events going on so you might want to check before you go."}
{"text":"I am taking one star away after my last visit. I used the bathroom, WOW. It smells like I'm going to catch every communicable disease under the sun in there! Clean that bathroom guys!   The food is still phenomenal."}
{"text":"I wish there was a Happy Dog in Detroit. The idea of this place is brilliant. Prices were excellent and the tater tots were the best ever.   As for the hot dog; it was pretty good. I added baked beans, mustard, and onion to mine and it was a meal in itself. My bf added slaw, peppers, onions, etc and he said his good too. And as mentioned before, the tater tots were awesome! There were many, many sauces to choose from and each one was really good. The bartender brought us his favorites and we picked a few of our own. Very interesting blends and all were really tasty.   They had a ton of beer too. I am not a beer drinker but I can see a beer drinker being excited by their selection. The local area was pretty quaint and the decor of the establishment was cute too. I like this place A LOT. I will go back.   P.S. I ordered a mixed drink and it was STRONG. I like a stiff drink so that was another bonus. Oh, and parking down the street is free and felt safe."}
{"text":"Good lord -- hot dogs!!$#@!%*&!  I never thought visiting Cleveland would be so delicious! Now I know better and cannot wait to go back!  Happy Dog has the makings of the best of corner bars: Great Beer, music, ambience - and delicious cheap FOOD. After agonizing over the convenient check-box menu/ordering slips, I decided to trust in the pre-engineered fat kid menu on the back and ordered two hot dogs at just $5.00 a piece.   A Muey el Popular (Red Chile & chocolate mole sauce, Spanish onions, chunky peanut butter & Nueske bacon) and a Chicago Style (Yellow mustard, \"Alien\" pickle relish, Roma tomatoes, Spanish Onlines, dill pickle spear, & sport peppers) hot dog were my final picks. I also relaxed into my Sunday morning, pre-seven-hour-drive-back-to-Philly yoga pants and ordered the fries with bourbon baked  beans on top.  Add in a pint or two of Willoughby Brewing Peanut Butter Cup Coffee Porter and prepare to bask in the food coma about to ensue in 3...2..."}
{"text":"Mabel... Black Label... Carlings Black Label beer. If you remember that little jingle you must be as old as me. I haven't seen a Carlings Black Label beer in like 40 years. I did notice it's now made in Canada. This is just a great neighborhood bar. You can't help but have a great time here. The staff is great too. They also have a pear cider the taste of which is hard to describe. It kind of taste almost like champagne. The hotdogs are just fabulous. They have every topping you could think of and plenty you would never expect. Believe me that's an understatement. Anytime I'm in the area I'll make it a point to stop in."}
{"text":"I love this place for many reasons, there's things I don't particularly like. I'll get the don't likes out of the way first, there's very few and their not big problems.   - there is live music, which I love, but its so loud in there when there is. It may be the layout of the place and the echo it creates off the walls, or the gigantic speakers that are inches from the bar when you're trying to sit and enjoy during your stay.   Actually, other than that little complaint, it's all smooth sailing from here on out. Sit back and enjoy as I take you into the wonderful world of Cleveland's own Happy Dog!  I can't believe I'm just getting around to my review of This establishment \"ashamed\" (PW knows what I'm talkin about) hahaha. Anyways, their hot dogs are amazing. You're supplied with a hefty checklist consisting of toppings ranging from chimichura to peanut butter. They even had fruit loops once upon a time, they still might..? That's for all you adventurers.  For simpletons such as myself, there is different ketchups and mustards, hot sauces, onions and plenty of other toppings. I don't want to spoil the initial surprise of your first glance at the list. After choosing this wonderful creation you're about to eat off of an all beef hot dog, or a vegan sausage, you choose tater tots or fries for a side. Tots are awesome, I recommend them. To wash all this down they have a Willoughby Peanut Butter Porter beer. I normally wouldn't be a fan of something like this, but its gooood. I prefer Bell's Two Hearted Ale(my personal favorite beer).   The bar is an old school feeling bar, I still want to get a shirt someday, possibly, I live 30seconds from the pace, so it may be a bit tacky of me. They have a bar downstairs also, which I think I've been to once in all my times there. The old logo of the dog is awesome, best thing about this place possibly. They replaced it on the outside, but the old one remains in front of the staircase to the downstairs bar/bathroom.   So, to wrap up the mental tour of Happy Dog, if you're looking for a laid back place that has good eats, a good variety of beers, standard full-bar and a wide variety of people of all ages, races, religions, political beliefs and even social outcasts(hipsters) come to this spot right there on the corner of 58th and Detroit. It's a Happy Place!  Hit Dog - caramelized onions, egg, bacon, cucumbers, tater tota and a plethora of sides..."}
{"text":"Wet buns totally diminished what could have been an epic hotdog eating experience. On the very first bite, my gorgeous looking hotdog and carefully selected toppings plopped into the basket below, leaving me with only a soggy, saturated goop of a bun in its place. This seems like such an absolute detail you have to nail, but the bun seems to be an afterthought here."}
{"text":"Lots of beer to choose from. Lots of toppings to choose from. My Libra self had a hard time choosing! Was recommended to try the vegan dog instead of the beef, wouldn't have known it was veggies if no one told me!  I'd eat here again if I'm in town."}
{"text":"Amazing hot dogs and tots. Variety of toppings, but I highly recommend getting a fried egg on top of your hot dog regardless. The creamy yolk complements the hot dog well. The variety of dipping sauces for the tots are excellent as well. Food was always warm and served quickly. Unpretentious atmosphere and very good prices."}
{"text":"I think they had the best tater tots i've ever had, and according to my bf i'm a tater-hater since I prefer french fries 10/10. The place reminds me of a hole in the wall college bar, complete with band stage in the corner--this by no means is a bad thing and it just meant that they were all about the food and drink (lots of beer btw) and not so much about the ambiance. You order your hot dog ala carte and mark up which toppings that you want which run from the ordinary (homemade ketchup) to what (kim chee). The waitress was really helpful in giving us some advice, like you probably don't want more than 4 toppings on your dog otherwise it tastes mushy, and recommending breakfast tots (see below).  The one hot dog I got was filling and had black truffle honey mustard, carmelized onions, potato chips, and an egg. Delicious. The black truffle flavor got a little lost but that really wasn't a problem. Now, breakfast tots are a must have-smoked gouda, bacon, and egg served with a side of homemade ketchup. My only complaint was that I was hoping the gouda would be more melted so it would stick to the tots but in the tots defense, it kept them crunchy for the whole meal. We came right when they opened on Saturday and the dining area filled up fast. I also appreciated the waitress didn't rush us at all and in fact encouraged a little loitering even after we were done eating."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here on 5/11/13 and were able to eat all we could and our bill ended up being $20.  You can't ask for a better place to stop in for a drink and food."}
{"text":"I'm Happy to be Under the Dog!   Is that how it's supposed to work?  Either way, the Underdog is rocking.  I love how it has the same vibe and feel as upstairs but more so.  The TV's don't show sports (upstairs) but do show awesome vintage kitsch movies.  They don't serve hotdogs (upstairs) but I heard a rumor they'll be doing burgers.  What they do have in common is the same quality staff, drinks and with more games to boot!    I can't wait till they get the rules up on the chalkboard for bar shuffleboard.  Otherwise, there is a very good chance to get into a fight with a team of rugby players.  Just sayin."}
{"text":"I FREAKIN' love this place. The vibe of laid back \"hey man, everything is everything just be cool\" is how I wish the world were. How many toppings can you put on a hot dog? Let your taste buds run wild at Happy Dog because the list is a whole page ling with even more on the back. And, please do me, no, do yourself a favor and get the tater tots.   And if you think this is your grandfather's hot dog you are so far from the truth I can only say....nope. The 1/4# locally made \"hot dog\" is a beautiful blend of whatever top end of whatever does get stuffed in that meat sleeve.  So I say stuff your own gullet and wash it down with one of the many rotating craft beers. Mm'....Mm'....good.  Invite me when you go."}
{"text":"Mmmm, hot dogs.  Maybe the novelty of 50 toppings hasn't worn off yet, but I love having so many options!  True, there is a very real potential of creating something truly foul when Fruit Loops and chipotle hollandaise are among the choices, but I've been really pleased with the dogs so far.  And you can also order off a menu of pre-screened topping combinations.    Some of my favorites: collard greens cooked in bacon, vodka sauerkraut, and the fresh cucumbers, potato chips, and pickle spears add a nice crunchy texture.  Also, the tots and dipping sauces complete the uber-processed food extravaganza.  Loving the chimichurri, Momocho's habanero hot sauce, saffron aioli, and the deal-sealer is usually any place with Sriracha.  Happy Dog is divey, but not so divey where you think twice about ordering food.  Great selection of beers on tap, although I would kill for a happy hour that went beyond domestic drafts."}
{"text":"Strangely enough, I cannot speak for Happy Dog's food. I've never tried it! Stupid, I know. Next time, I promise ...  But I have come here on a number on occasions and taken in some sweet shows. It is a place that makes you feel right at home... or at least makes ME feel right at home, I don't know about YOU...  The sound is pretty good and the layout is not too shabby. I live far, far away from the Happy Dog now, and I can safely say I miss it."}
{"text":"Love me some happy dog. As of yesterday I decided to venture out of the box from my norm. Usually, I am boring and I get the house made ketchup (to die for!), stadium mustard and sauerkraut.   When I was there yesterday, I went with pimento mac and cheese, bacon, sauerkraut and siracha. My only regret was siracha because there was a lot on it and my mouth was on fire the whole time.  I have a lot of combinations in my head that I want to try but I get cold feet every time the list is handed to me.  GREAT FOOD, FUN ATMOSPHERE!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing - a total dive but who cares? Made to order hot dogs and tater tots with beer! It doesn't get better than this"}
{"text":"There's nothing like a solid neighborhood hot dog joint. I love going to Scooter's Dawg House out in Mentor, but that's not exactly in my neighborhood...and while I really wanted the hot dog place in Coventry to be my neighborhood hot dog place, it never seemed to be open when I wanted to go there! (That place was sorta like Guns 'N Roses--when they're doing their thing, they're amazing, but they don't really do their thing with much regularity!) Fortunately, I think that I've struck gold on the west side, because The Happy Dog serves up some of the best hot dogs that I've had in a long time.  Honestly, my biggest problem with The Happy Dog is deciding what to get on my hot dog! There are SO many different toppings--I think there were at least 50! I spent at least 10 minutes deciding, and my choices were chorizo chili, smoked gouda, and grilled onions. My wife Sheila F. got chocolate mole sauce.  Both of our dogs were delicious. One nice thing about The Happy Dog is that the dogs themselves are substantial--people go nuts about Skyline Chili, and while I enjoy it for what it is, I always feel like a treasure hunter when I eat there because it's always a rewarding experience to find the miniscule hot dog in the bun amidst the chili and cheese. Fortunately, The Happy Dog serves 'em up thick and meaty.   For side dishes, my wife got the tater tots and I got the fries. There's a wide variety of dipping sauces for them too; I had the chili grape jelly sauce and my wife had the garlic aioli (which was glorious).   This place also serves up a wide variety of beers and drinks at decent prices; we didn't have one when we went, but I'm sure we'll grab some in the future.  We were told that there was supposed to be live music, and my law school classmate who we saw while dining spoke very highly of the band, but by the time we were done eating, both my wife and I had such serious food comas that we decided it was best to head out before we fell asleep at the table. From what I've seen on the website, they have live music pretty often, so maybe we'll hear it on the many future visits that we will make to this establishment in the future.  The Happy Dog definitely makes its patrons very happy people, and you'll most likely be happy as a clam if you go there!"}
{"text":"This is the best dive I have ever been to. Brought my daughter and son-in-law here for the hot dogs... It was memorable... for those of you who are conflicted. Do you want hot dogs or steak. We were in a hot dog kind of place... and we loved it. A bit of Americana... no frills just good eats."}
{"text":"Happy Dog is where you go to get greasy tots and cheap hot dogs paired with a $3 well drink. It's no frill, divey, and fun. I would highly recommend going here to hang out with your friends or chat over some cheap food"}
{"text":"Create your own hot dog, chili dog, siracha & fritos dog...Any Dog! They have so many toppings to choose from that if you were to limit yourself to just 3 toppings (you're allowed as many as you like), you could create 25,000 different hot dogs. (trust me I'm a math major) This place has great tater tots too.  And even more importantly, I've heard some of the best music I've ever heard in Cleveland here at Happy Dog.  LOVE THIS PLACE"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of any place that takes vegetarians into consideration, and happy dog is one of them!! I'm always sad when my friends get hot dogs at ballgames and I can't partake (tho trust me, I am quite content with my nachos and pretzels). And, I'm glad I can enjoy a hot dog outside my own kitchen! And, Happy Dog's veggie dog is delicious!!   If you're new to CLE, I'm sure every review touches on this - but basically you build your own hot dog from a checklist of normal hot dog toppings to not-so-normal hot dog toppings. These range from pickles, relish, and onions to peanut butter, fruit loops, and spaghetti-o's! The options are endless and if you're too stressed out about picking toppings, they have their suggested dogs.   I personally like their fries more than their tots - weird, I know. AND, I love that they have veggie chili so I can make chili cheese fries without the meat!!   They have a countless number of sauces to choose from. And, they all come on the side, so if it sounds good and you want to try it, check it off! what's there to lose?? The top secret fry sauce, chipotle hollandaise, and the chimichurri sauce are my faves.  It's all an amazing value too- each dog is $5. They always have drink specials- I drank 4 yuengling's for $2 a piece the last time I was there!   Overall, I'm happy :)"}
{"text":"I'm not really a hot dog person either, but I make an exception a when it comes to Happy Dog.  Best hotdogs in Cleveland!  You can pick from a regular all-beef dog or a veggie dog, with your choice of about 1,000 toppings.  Well not really, but the variety of toppings is unreal and leaves for an endless number of combinations! Chorizo Chili, a few kinds of coleslaw, a plethora of cheeses, fried egg, Alien relish, chunky peanut butter, Spaghetti-Os, Fruit Loops, a whole bunch of sauces...it's insane!   Two dogs is enough to fill most people up, but if you add in a basket of tots, you're done for.  Any of the hotdog sauces are available for tot dipping sauces as well. I wish the tots were homemade, but they look like the frozen Ore-ida variety...still tasty though, especially when drunk.  The inside is very casual, hipsteresque with the bar in the middle and tables and booths surrounding it. There's a stage right by the entrance for live music and it gets pretty loud on the weekends.    Overall a great, layed back place to come for an epic cheat meal or a few beers.  Steve L is lucky to live right by Happy Dog."}
{"text":"I'm confused! Did I not review happy dog yet? Well either way, 5 stars baby! because I love all the toppings on the dogs. Finally for once got enough sour type toppings - sometimes my dog is too rich. Food was a mess, but so good. I got the vegan dog but with tons of toppings and bacon. The dog tasted more like meat than a hot dog! Wanted a Lako beer but they were out of it so I got the delicious peanut butter porter. Food was almost instantly out. Love the chimichuri (sp?) sauce. Go to happy dog. But your car might get swallowed by the parking lot. I could have filled in all the holes with the tots I can't finish at happy dog tho - what a waste!"}
{"text":"Such an awesome atmosphere. If you love a great selection of beer this is the place to go. The tots and all the sauces are da bomb!"}
{"text":"Diggity dog. This ain't your street corner hot dog pusher.  Here's what i ate. Muey el popular: red chile and chocolate mole sauce, Spanish onion, chunky peanut butter, nuske bacon.  Anyone who can pull off peanut butter on a hot dogs and can make it taste great with the other toppings is ivy league IMO.  Tater tots with five different sauces.  This place is so unique. Very diverse crowd, yes even you with your bathrobe or 3 piece suit can fit in here. Waitresses were all tattooed, all tastefully done so nice to see this difference that went along with the very great service. Bathrooms were not the tidiest.  But it's a bar, we're not at a fancy hotel.  You can hold it til you get to the lobby of the ritz."}
{"text":"Oh Happy Dog - how have I not written a review of you yet???  Of course, I'm a little glad I didn't because now I can also write about the cool bar the opened downstairs!!  A friend of mine first brought a group of us to this paradise after a wedding and it was dead, dead, dead inside....but you could still FEEL the ambiance.  I don't know if it was DJ Kishka or the Hipsters taking over or if people just finally realized how cool this neighborhood is - but the HD has taken off!!!  First of all, let me just compliment DJ Kishka - Polka Happy Hour is the best idea since...hot dogs!!  I grew up with a Slovenian mother who played the button-box (I am not going to explain what this is - if you are true Slovenian Clevelander you already know - the rest of you need a Polka education so look it up and read about the history of Cleveland!!) so coming in to listen to old Polka records was like walking back into my childhood...allbeit we added beer.  If my mom was still alive she would be here dancing away!!!  And yelling at DJ Kishka to play less Polish and more Slovenian Polkas!!!  Secondly, the hot dogs.  Yum, yum, yum!!!  The hardest part is choosing the toppings - I always want to try something new but I already love the toppings I have tried in the past.  The best I can do is a mix of old and new and someday I might get through the menu!!  My husband had the peanut butter Symon hot dog.  In theory, disgusting...in reality - delish!!!  Thirdly, the tots.  HELLLOOOO childhood - if the Polka wasn't enough...how about some tots???  Fourth, the new bar downstairs.  Games?  Old movies that should have been on Mystery Science Theater 3000??  A break from the huge crowd upstairs????  YES - thank you HD for once again raising the bar!!!  ...er adding a bar??  Fifth, and I'll stop here - the beer selection.  I had a tear in my eye."}
{"text":"Honestly not sure what all the hype about this place is about. The food is nothing special. The atmosphere wasn't anything special either. I really wanted to like this place but it was just so-so. The toppings are extremely overwhelming on your hot dog and everything just seems to get lost when mixed together. My tots were cold and try. Possibly willing to try this place again?"}
{"text":"While attending WMC Fest in Cleveland, my husband and I had to try Happy Dog. We are from Columbus and absolutely love our Dirty Franks Hot Dog Palace. Obviously we needed to compare! My pros/cons lists reflect that in a way.  Pros: - A LOT of options when it comes to dogs and beer - Large space  - My husband loved the spicy/peanut butter toppings he ordered  Cons: - Not the most friendly staff (especially since we were clearly clueless)  Again, we are biased but Happy Dog was great. If you ever come to Columbus...come by Dirty Franks and compare them for yourself!"}
{"text":"For what it is, Happy Dog is pretty spectacular.  This is one of those extremely specialized / limited menu kind of places... regular or vegetarian hot dog, fries/tater tots... and that's about it.  If you don't want that, you should probably try elsewhere.  If you do want that, then you've come to the right place.  The vegetarian dog is very very good.  The list of toppings is huge and makes the ordering process quite the adventure.  It's a sushi style select things from a card type ordering system, which works pretty well considering all the possible topping combinations.  Some of them seem a bit odd, like fruit loops, but to each his or her own.  The fries come with a selection of sauces, and they all are quite good.  The nacho cheese sauce that can be added to the fries or tots is definitely worth it... yum!  Not the healthiest place in the universe, but tasty.  The draft beer selection is also excellent, though a little above average on the prices.  The seating is pretty meh in here, and its a seat yourself kind of place... I recommend sitting at the spacious bar.  All the food can be ordered right from there, and the service seems to be faster.  There is also 2 free but very crappy small parking lots for the place right next door, which is nice.  Tis a bit far away, but they are going to open one in university circle where Euclid Tavern was, which is much much closer!  Hurrah!"}
{"text":"I make better hot dogs at home.  I guess it's cool with a group of people but the actual hot dog has a weird (not good) taste.  I prefer a Hebrew National."}
{"text":"Good prices. Unlimited toppings free of charge for a $6 dog, can't beat that! And they had vegetarian dog for me, even better!!!! There wasn't live music when I went. The place was a little too dark to my liking and definitely just a bar type feel, even though children are allowed. Service was ok, not greeted upon arrival and was hardly checked on, felt more awkward having to ask how to order. Didn't get details on the restaurant being that it was our first time here, let alone the state. The servers weren't very helpful nor were they informative."}
