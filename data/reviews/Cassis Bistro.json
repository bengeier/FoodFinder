{"text":"Romantic ambience, scrumptious food, friendly servers, an intimate & cozy setting... what more could you ask for, espessially if you are one of zose peeppul who love ze cuisine a la Francais et wondering ou aller au Calgary. Cassis Bistro - c'est tres bien! All the items we ordered were very well made: lamb merguez, lobster bisque, and duck confit. Everything looked and tasted mouth-wateringly good.  The place was small and packed, so I highly suggest booking in advance. Oh, and like Foreign Cinema in SF (check out my previous recommendation), this place had a movie projected on the main wall! Totally cute."}
{"text":"Went to Cassis for the first time for brunch.  Such a great find, the food was fabulous, the ambiance was perfect, the service was great.  If you are looking to try a new brunch spot that will become your new favourite this is the place!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent little French bistro with a simple menu. I love their seasonal ratatouille, salads and brunoised vegetables.  The seating can be cramped."}
{"text":"A few posts ago I went on a rant about food in Calgary and how we need to demand better.  I \"might have mentioned\" that Cassis was not really a bistro.  I had eaten there once and had not given it a proper chance.  Maybe I was just being a fuckerass that day!  Last night I went back to enjoy a meal with my lovely wife before leaving for another medical conference.  I was hoping to be blown away.  I WAS!  Cassis truly is what a \"moderne\" bistro should be.  Modern and warm ambiance, delicious traditional french bistro cuisine.  The menu is small and changes at very good intervals.  There are no wines over $100.  At least I did not notice any.  The food is simple, fresh, elegant and melancholic... I don't know if any of you have watched the animated picture Ratatouille, I have many times with my son.  Regardless, there is a scene where a food critic eats a simple, yet perfectly prepared ratatouille (eggplant, tomato and courgette stew: peasant food) and we see images of his past as a boy, remembering the feeling of safety and love his mother gave him when he was served that ratatouille.  Bistro food should be like that... I remember mostly Italian cooking from my youth, but the sentiment of well cooked, simple things that make us feel warm and fuzzy regardless of wine should be in every bite!  Cassis does this and does it well.  MENU    Tartare de boeuf    Cassoulet de Canard et Porc Salé  The tartare was remarkable.  Very traditional and served with croutons and a raw egg yolk on the half shell.  Extremely well seasoned... The menu mentions \"au couteau\" which means it was chopped by hand with a knife.  It was.  You can just tell the difference.  All condiments and seasoning were chopped with it, giving the tartare a beautiful energetic taste.  I do not normally like tartare... I would order this again and again as a main course.  The cassoulet was excellent.  Cassoulet is a slow cooked dish from the south of France.  Different regions of Southern France have different takes on cassoulet, but they should all be a white bean based stew.  This variation is Chef's signature dish.  He has very good caligraphy!  The cassoulet was tomato based, a very common thing in Southern France.  The proteins where \"EXTREMELY LOW FAT\" salted pork and duck confit.  ** Confit is a manner of slow cooking an item in a fat of some sort.  Duck confit is usually duck thigh slow cooked in duck fat... Yup... Sounds disgusting!!!! Fucking delicious!!!  We were eating some pretty bold flavors so we opted for a Bordeaux wine (CAB SAUV).  I was really really happy when I left.  FELICITATION À MON NOUVEAU BISTRO PRÉFÉRÉ À CALGARY!  Go and eat..."}
{"text":"Excellent French restaurant in Calgary. The beef tartare  is divine and the service is second to none!"}
{"text":"What a cute little place this is! Was in the area with a friend who just bought a place down the street and decided to try it out, since im never in this particular part of town. We strolled around Market 17 (like a completely organic Sunterra Market) and around the other side of the wall is Cassis..no doors, you can stroll right in. The restaurant itself is not very big, but nice, clean and simple. They offer water for $1, it comes still or sparkling and they do it in house. Its a big bottle people, but im sure if you wanted just tap water they would oblige. I had the Pissaladiere and my friend had the Quiche which was mushroom and carmelized onion. Both came with a salad, that was made of butter lettuce (my fave) and green beans. Our meals, are quite similar, mine being more simple, a whole buch of carmelized onions, a few roasted peppers and anchovy on a flaky pastry crust. The anchovy was suprisingly not overwhleming. Both were to DIE for. All the ingredients were fresh, and you can tell its home made. For dessert we had coffee(i believe they have only americanos) they serve you warm milk, so it doesnt cool your drink. Very good, not bitter as I always expect americanos to be.for dessert, we had two pastries, shaped like beignets(french donuts).One had a traditonal cream the other a hazelnut filling. ... crazy delicious! The fillings were not too sweet, and smooth. Just the right amount of filling to beignet ratio. I also love that the menu isnt too big, which can be overwhelming...now to try everything else on offer!"}
{"text":"I've been there for dinner. It's excellent! The real French food.  Great atmosphere, a bit noisy though. The place is small and I recommend making a reservation ahead. Great spot."}
{"text":"Had an extremely enjoyable meal at Cassis.  The French Onion Soup was truly French - delicious.  The sea bass was cooked to perfection and the Iles Flottantes dessert, shared by all four of us, was quite delightful.  How do you make meringue that melts like that?"}
{"text":"I discovered this place by chance one day when the food trucks were parked in the neighbourhood. And what a pleasant surprise! The dishes are do die for, incredibly tasty and delicious, with high quality ingredients and a master chef hand to prepare them! It reminded me of Paris...and that French people always go for quality rather than quantity...the decor is also beautiful, what a great place to be! I will definitely return- it's a great place to meet your best friend over a coffee and a light meal, or for a romantic dinner. Simple perfection!"}
{"text":"Cassis offered wonderful food, and very expert servers, who know a great deal about what they're serving, and about their wine selection. This is no small accomplishment; too many restaurants want to \"push\" a particular wine, and servers often have no knowledge of food pairings. Cassis has this down to a science.  Now for the negative: it is a small, packed place, and noise level is unbelievable. Much like when a live band sets up and overpowers the enjoyment of everything else, the din of everyone crammed into that small space made normal conversation almost impossible. Also, they have an interesting design element of a screen showing silent movies -- we were seated right next to the screen, and if you are the unfortunate diner facing the screen, you will get motion-sick trying to focus on your companion while attempting to ignore Yves Montand and his antics on film.  I'll be back when their patio is open, or at a \"slow\" time when it's not quite so populated. I know they were trying for the vibe of a busy French bistro; when the noise level detracts from the experience (and the food), then you've got a problem."}
{"text":"The chef is unaccommodating. He refused my simple, starch free variation to the steak tartare: slices of cucumber over Frito Lay potato chips. For the main, my host ordered the steak frites, as did I, but I wanted no fries and double the salad. My plate arrived with the regular portion of salad; my friend's had the same size salad, but his plate was overflowing with fries. I guess I learned who calls the shots at Cassis, and it sure isn't the customer!   One risks embarrassment by taking an out of town guest to Cassis. Calgary has better, friendlier choices. Although the atmosphere at Cassis is pleasant enough, the food was only average: something I could do as well at home. And the service, though obviously under stress caused by the unhappy tyrant in the kitchen, was first class."}
{"text":"If you are looking to eat the best food in the city, look no further.  I absolutely am not over stating...  This is simple, fresh, expertly created/crafted, DELICIOUS food - period.    Each time I sit down at this restaurant, my mouth waters with what awaits me.  Maybe today the plat du jour is beef bourgeon, moules frites, or an omelette!  I am never disappointed.  The experienced, knowledgeable and lovely servers make sure you are always making the right choice for your meal and pairings.  The cozy atmosphere has 2 experiences - the bright cheery, maybe you are in the south France, delightful feel during the day OR the intimate, energy filled, sexy, fun feel in the evening.    You should make a reservations, but the amazing owners Gilles and Andrea try so very hard to get everyone in and will never rush you out of your table.  This sometimes translates into some waiting, but your patience will be rewarded 10-fold!!  While you are waiting you may be offered a glass of rosé or bubbly and most likely you'll make a new friend waiting with you.   Come with family, friends, large or small groups, young or old - Cassis will make the experience more than memorable, I promise you.    There is plenty of parking - either on the street out in front of the restaurant or on the streets in the neighbourhood, there is also underground parking for a small fee ($3.00) in which you are escorted at the end of your meal if it is after hours for the Marché.  Get yourself over there!"}
{"text":"Beautiful food, friendly service, great wine and lively atmosphere.  Good for two or a group."}
{"text":"I have been to Cassis twice now, and both times had a great time. Great atmosphere in the place. The food and wine are both fantastic. Services is top notch too. A great spot."}
{"text":"I love this resto.  It delivers in all the ways you expect, and reminds me of the 2 weeks I spent in Paris.   Food:  Delish starters. Try the steak tartare, tapenade. We had the pickerel (fish) as an entree, and it was cooked perfectly. I grew up eating fresh pickerel from the lake in Saskatchewan, but never like this! Excellent wines, good desserts.  Service:  Our waiter was fantastic and took great care of us.   Atmosphere:  We had our anniversary dinner here, and it was lovely.  Not loud - we could hear each other across the table. It was not busy (Wed evening) so we were pretty much on our own for most of the meal, but if it was busy it would not be as private.  Question:  When it's very hot out, and you have a patio outside, why not turn some air con on for the diners inside?  Sticking to the plastic seats was not comfy."}
{"text":"This has become one of our favourite restaurants in Calgary for special occasions. The service is excellent and the staff are very knowledgeable about the food.  Everything is rich and flavourful, but we have to plan ahead so we have room for every incredible course.  For French cuisine particularly, I would recommend this as a splurge that is totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Lovely resto.  I'm not a huge fan of quiche, but since it was the daily special, I gave it a whirl and am so glad I did.  The handmade pastry crust was buttery, flakey yet soft, and one of the best my mouth has ever experienced.  Service was near flawless.  The only complaint is that this tiny space is quite noisy with a few tables sat, causing us to strain to hear conversation during a business lunch."}
{"text":"I am arguably the laziest restaurant \"critic\" (read:enthusiast) in Calgary. To be sure, it took me 5 months to complete my 300-word review of the Living Room. In my own defense, as a parent of 2.5 kids I don't go out very often. (I have been out for dinner exactly twice since April-I owe you all a review of Bonterra, which I will work on recalling through the alcoholic haze-the short review is \"meh\")  Chalk it up to coincidence, then, that my salubrious experience at the Cassis Bistro was thanks in part to the same waiter (Gilles?) I raved about at the Living Room.  I think he owns/manages this particular joint. The dude (homme) seems to know what he's doing (though he didn't wait my table this night)     Cassis is in a new medium-rise condo building about 4 blocks from my house-I have been to this location a couple of times to check out the neat but blatantly overpriced Market 17 ($17.50/lb for Kicking Horse coffee? C'mon.). You'll find the (equally expensive) J Webb Wine Market there as well.  Cassis is located neatly at the back of the market, and they've done a good job with the small space (I guessed it would seat 30-40 people at full capacity). It's a bistro, remember...which means \"hurry the hell up\" in Cossack. Seating was prompt, but we were the first ones to arrive for dinner at the decidedly unhip hour of 5:30  (had a talk to attend at 7:30, though). It's a buck for still or sparkling water, but it works and it keeps the wait staff attentive somehow. Plus, you should drink more water anyway especially when you're boozing it up.  Speaking of which, I ordered a bourbon to get going...unavailable. Aw, dammit, that'll cost half a star. Got a scotch instead, then switched to so-so wine, and after that ordered an even worse draught beer to get the taste out of my mouth. ( the one draught beer available is 1664 Blanc-it was the first, and only time I will ever try it-no man could like this beer) On to the menu-it's a one-pager, which I do like. Very (tres) French. There are about 4 entrees, several appetizers (which I skipped that night but made a note to try next time) And a \"bites\" menu, which is antipasto etc, for two. My ladyfriend and I shared the roasted red peppers and the lamb sausages, both were very good. She ordered the trout, and I the pork chop. The kitchen got it out to us quickly. The pork was very, very good, well-plated, in a creamy hot mustard sauce. It came with whipped potatoes. Also had a side of roasted potatoes to share, which may have been a trifle salty for some, but they worked well for my deadened tastebuds. By all means check Cassis out, I doubt you'll be dissappointed. Service is very good. They need a bit of work on their bar menu to satisfy a liquor enthusiast like myself (really they just need to get a bottle of bourbon or two). Allons-y!"}
{"text":"My favourite French restaurant in Calgary. They always play black and white silent movies on the wall inside, and they also have a lovely patio. I particularly like their approach to French classics: steak frites, salade niçoise, croque monsieur, etc."}
{"text":"Excellent service, small and can get a little crowded, but has a nice atmosphere and although the menu is small the food was excellent, and attention to detail showed. Highly recommended if in Calgary, but reserve ahead."}
{"text":"Best steak frite outside of Paris.  The other best part was the attentive service by the French waiters - our group really enjoyed the attention.  This is a great room that is beautifully decorated.  The menu is simple and the wine list compliments that.   Make sure to reserve as it is a smaller room and fills up quickly!"}
{"text":"A very special day deserves special food. It was the first time we been to Cassis and let me tell you, it won't be the last.  From the moment we stepped in to the minute we left we had an amazing experience. We got sat at a table for two at the back and at times I felt like I was transported back to Paris for the evening.  Ambience was romantic with the soft lighting, French music and black & white movies playing in the background.    Our service was one of the best servers I have ever had. Very accommodating and just went out of his way to make sure everything was fantastic.   We ordered the beef tartar, scallop & lobster salad and mussels with fries... After enjoying the tartar and salad (which were amazing by the way) a couple friends that we haven't seen in months stopped by to say hi on their way out.. we ended up talking with them for about 30 minutes, which made our mussels and fries get cold. (This didn't stop us from continue to eat them) however our server came by and says \"these are best enjoyed warm, I'm going to take these away and get you some fresh hot ones and new fries\"   In shock of his kindness I say \"oh no no, it's ok please don't inconvenience anyone on our behalf\" and he says politely \"it is our pleasure, we want you to have a wonderful experience, and this is what we do at Cassis\"  Well, just with that I was sold. The food is excellent, the service amazing and the space adorable. I want to go back time and time again!   PS - the French 75's have a kick to them! (esp after a bottle of wine)"}
{"text":"The service was terrible, food took about 40 min to come out, the server never came around to ask if we needed drinks or anything else and we saw she was dancing in the back with another customer which was really weird. Also same server yelled at one of the other service girls in front of everyone to get stuff done which was really inappropriate and awkward. Once the food got to us steaks were well done not medium rare and the sides were mistaken but we didn't send the food back as we were just hungry at that time. Finally server asked about drinks but never got them to us. She was just ridiculously bad. At the end we left really upset about choosing cassis and will never go back."}
{"text":"Today I had the pleasure of going to Cassis Bistro Located on 2505 17th Ave SW in Calgary or incase you prefer to go off of landmarks, it's on the main floor of Casel Marché. The Bistro is small but quaint with tables nicely lined along the walls and in the middle, some tables with half side of a booth or tables each with a metal chair accompanied with a soft pillow to sit on. It is really cute and quaint.  Our waitress was lovely and super friendly, on the ball and attentive. For a starter we ordered Champignon a la Grecque, which consisted of Lemon, olive oil, Thyme, White wine, tomato and coriander seed with freshly sliced baguette to go with it. It was delicious. We ran out of bread before we ran out of food, so the waitress kindly gave us more (without us asking). We both ordered Americano coffee's to drink, and let me tell you it was so delicious that I had to order a second one. I had anticipated paying about $6-8 for the coffee, and was pleasantly surprised to see the each drink was $3 each - had I know I may have requested 6 cups more; just delicious!  For a main I had Croque Madame (warm sandwich) that had béchamel, ham, cheese, friend egg with a mixed Salad on the side. My first bite, I tried it without the egg and it was delicious, the bread was toasted to perfection and the cheese on top was still warm and savoury. Second bite I tried with the egg and broke the yolk. Unfortunately the added flavour of egg yolk kind of ruined the deliciousness that I had originally tasted, I removed the egg afterward and continued to eat it without it. As I made my way to the end the bread had become a bit soggy, and the wet taste of bread along with the cheese and béchamel was really unenjoyable. Maybe because I'm a slow eater and should have been eating faster and stopped talking to the company I was with, that it turned out that way. Nonetheless no one to blame for that but myself. The salad was delicious as well, it complimented the flavours nicely.  For a dessert I shared the lemon tart. I was really looking forward to be blown away by it but it kind of fell short. I really wanted that real taste of lemon - it was there, just not a big enough pop of flavour in my mouth, the sourness of it was perfect though. I half expected the lemon to kind of \"melt in your mouth\" although that wasn't the case, it was too cold from the fridge that it had been sitting in. Would I have it again? Probably not, but it was good enough to have, and to say I'd tried it.  Overall the experience and service was excellent. The food was great, and it was well worth the money we spent. I'd strongly advise anyone looking to have a delicious, authentic french meal to go here, you certainly won't regret it."}
{"text":"I really enjoy European food so when I read about Cassis Bistro in a recent FFWD review, I was very eager to try it out. My last experiences with French food have been disappointing. Most of the French food in Calgary is usually very salty, fatty and served with a lot of heavy sauces.   The FFWD review suggested making reservations... I did reserve a table for 2 for Friday night but we were late so we ended up waiting for a few minutes. While we waited, the owner (Gilles) graciously gave us a complimentary beverage of choice (I enjoyed a Rose Brut and my boyfriend had a small pint of Kronenbourg Blanc 1664, a white, lemony-tasting beer perfect for summer sipping)   Cassis' menu is well-thought (not too many items) and combines simple, regional ingredients to produce simple, clean tastes on your palate. I like that their ingredients are available to purchase at Casel Marche (the adjoining market). To start, we tried the prosciutto stuffed calamari and the Alberta beef tartare. The calamari and bacon flavor of the prosciutto were a perfect pairing with the butter leaf lettuce salad and its light vinagrette. My boyfriend loved the beef tartare served with toasted pieces of thinly cut baguette: It had the right amount of acidity/ caper/ salty balance. Probably the best tartare we've had in the city!  Our mains were also a great success: Manitoba pickerel with potatoes and green beans and chicken basquaise. Both proteins were cooked perfectly. Again, there was an emphasis on clean, fresh tasting notes and plating. The decor of Cassis compliments its dishes well; simple grey walls with framed photos of French landmarks and floating maple shelves adorned with French books/ decor and fresh flower vases. There is also a touch of humor with the projector silently playing French black and white films with subtitles on the back wall.  Service-wise, Cassis reminds me of Una's style of \"team\" serving (btw, Una recently won best service in the city). Our waiter was attentive and pleasantly friendly. He made an excellent wine recommendation from the Bourgogne/ Burgungy region of France for our meal.  Cassis is a great bistro for a first date, an intimate meal or a small group gathering. It definitely adds a fresh take on French food in the city. I look forward to trying brunch, lunch and another dinner (or more!) at Cassis."}
{"text":"This little French restaurant has lots to offer.  Firstly, the service is excellent. All the staff & owner are very knowledgeable about their menu & take the time to explain any questions.  TheIr house cocktail is a must try! The Entrées are few but each goes beyond your expectations.   And don't leave without trying the desserts.  I'll be sure to go back again!"}
{"text":"Words simply do not do enough service to describe Cassis Bistro, and to document this evening via Instagram would simply dilute the purity of what this small, but incredible place represents. Simple, farm-fresh ingredients paired with the kind of passion for food that owner, Gilles Brassart has had since he was a child, result in the kind of French dining experience that's in store for you.  The moment you walk in the door, you are warmly greeted like you are an old friend. The atmosphere of the space is cozy, very French with a little contemporary styling to bring it all together. The servers are very knowledgable and friendly and have intimate knowledge of the various selections on the menu in addition to the techniques used to prepare them. This is a good sign since the worst thing a restaurant can do is not let the servers try the food.  The food is seasonal, using whatever is fresh and the preparation is simple, yet very technique driven. For example, the stuffed squid salad (a family recipe from Gilles) is an incredibly flavourful dish which highlights the delicate flavours of prosciutto, parsley and garlic, which is stuffed into the squid then quickly seared. It is then simply served in slices with a bed of fresh greens. Phenomenal.  The lamb chops are cooked to blushing perfection, served with a classic ratatouille which has been refined for the times. The texture and composition of the individual vegetables in the finely diced assemblage are on point and consistently even. Nothing is too soft or too hard. Chef Dominique Moussu has some serious skills.  Nothing fell short on this visit to Cassis Bistro. If you are looking for an upscale casual evening of dining on food driven by passion, you are in the right place."}
{"text":"Great little location, make reservations as it fills up quick.  Parking onsite and surrounded by a market and a great liquor store.  Food was very good, nothing great, but still good.  Prices are as expected for such a place.  This place absolutely shines with its great service, the best I have had in Alberta in a very long time.  A very nice date place."}
{"text":"I have had the pleasure of dining at Cassis twice now. I knew the owner as a pleasant server at The Living Room so wanted to try his restaurant when he ventured out on his own.  The location is funky-sort of off the beaten track but centralish and the room is funky in its minimalistic way.  Our last visit was a table for 10 and they accepted a reservation for us on a Sunday.  On the phone they suggested we accept the chefs dinner. I commented that it would be 8/10 peoples first visit and they would surely prefer to decide from the menu. Again when we arrived there was pressure to order the 5 course chef's menu.  I was told by the waitress that the kitchen was small and for a table of this size it would be best to order the chefs 5 course menu.  I informed her that there were many tastes at the table and that we would prefer 'a la carte'.  This is not a problem but we know next time that they prefer large groups to go from a set menu. We appreciated that they would make a concession to this 'rule'.  The menu was perfect and offered something for everyone. The wines we chose were amazing and paired perfectly with the food. The service was fine acknowledging that we had upset the flow so to speak. I am a fan of Gilles and his new restaurant and look forward to having a lunch there next time."}
{"text":"The food was excellent.   But.   Pushy service, very pricy short wine list ( 9 selections of red, highest over 1000 dollars), very tight quarters, strange layout with a grocery store open to the public, poor signage on the building, u will not find it on your first try, never again"}
{"text":"This is an excellent, excellent French restaurant.  I love it.  My cousin and I went there in the summer.  Beautiful French decor.  I had the duck.  It was rare but I loved that.  It was perfect.  A lovely chocolate cake dessert to die for.  One of my most favourite restaurants in Calgary."}
{"text":"I was blessed to find this great little restaurant.  It's French influenced with great service.  I started with the foie gras served with caramelized apples.   My  main meal was the sea bass served  on top of oyster mushrooms and greens.  They also had some unique deserts that is not so typical and it was great.   I highly recommend making reservations."}
{"text":"Exceptional atmosphere and ambience.  The food is a work of art, and the staff are great. This is my favourite 'special night out' restaurant.  It over delivers in every way, just make sure to reserve your table a few days in advance."}
{"text":"I had dinner at Cassis again with three of the most beautiful women in the world, my Mom and my Aunts. Awww ain't I bag of sweets?  But honestly, rarely do the four of us get a chance to get together for some fine dining and when my aunts demand a place that'll impress their frou-frou palate, one that has been refined with hours of Food Network viewing, I skipped hours of combing through Yelp (and Travel Advisor...NEVER URBANSPOON) and decided to come back to Cassis.  Gotta appreciate personable engagement from everyone at Cassis. From the reservations I made to selecting a wine to pair with my Lamb Provencale, theres no right amount of wax poetic I can use to describe how amazing everyone is.  Our Charcuterie starter and their Bites selection make a great combo and the most engaging appetizer experience. Their Lamb Provencale was rich and I thoroughly enjoyed it with a glass of wine- and I'm not much for wine but when the occasion calls for it, I do it up!  For dessert we all shared the mousse and this amazing meringue dish that floated on a creamy custard with almonds sprinkled."}
{"text":"Caillatte- pork meatball, sliced with a cauliflower cream pot and a side salad  Wow soo good  great service, bright location, a little hard to find but worth the search"}
{"text":"This is seriously as good as it gets! The quality of everything about your experience here is nothing short of the best. The staff become your friends, the food takes you on a journey, the store is everything you could ever want. I just love it! Love it ."}
{"text":"Easily the worst dining experience in Calgary. Here is why in 7: 1. Entrance and ambiance : as loud as a bar on playoffs, be ready to shout for 1 hr + irrelevant 1930 movie  2. Service: pretentious, way over the top   3. Menu: very limited choice, half french (ok guys, if you do not get it: it helps you feel being in Paris)  4. Waiting for food: 37 min (our server told us it is because one of you asked for well done steak. It is obviously our fault. It takes 3-5 min for a medium rare steak and 32 for a well done. Your know your heat transfer, calculate conduction coefficient and heat capacity in that piece of meat.    5. Food: Duck confit with skin on, how greasy that would be! Very salty (have a big water jar beside your bed), masking every flavour with garlic sauce   6. Price: you get less than a 6 oz steak for 37$! (j'ai oublie les frite!, Elles sont magnifiques)  7. At the end you get a goodbye and a fake smile form the guy with moustache."}
{"text":"Visited Cassis tonight.  It was outstanding.  Was greeted at the door with a nice white Kronenbourg.  Had the house Bourgogne with dinner.  The soup was HOT and delicious. My main was cod melded into mashed potatoes. A very unusual and tasty dish.  The service was unobtrusive but timely and helpful.  All in all our party of 6 had a great evening at this fine Provençal  spot in Calgary."}
{"text":"Reservations a must. Locale is comfortable. The food is excellent and very well prepared. The service was excellent. Very friendly as soon as we walked in.  The menu - small and very focused on fresh food of the day. I liked it. We started with mussels and steak tartare and finished with duck confit and the plate of the day pork chop. All the food was excellent. The duck confit is by far the best I have tasted in Calgary or any other French style restaurant in North America.  The dining in Calgary has declined in my opinion but there are some great gems in the city. This is one of them."}
{"text":"Excellent meal with friendly, knowledge and helpful staff. Enjoyable ambience and will definitely return"}
{"text":"Phenomenal, this bistro is one of the top places for me, the vibe, the atmosphere, the music, all just right. Outstanding service, very prompt. The food always speaks for the place, everything is amazing on the menu. I Always have the Tar Tar as a starter, and mains are all great, the duck, the steak-frites, seared scallops, and feature fish of the day.  Great for any occasion, but nice for a Date Night. The cocktails are delicious, and nice selection of wines."}
{"text":"My fav spot for an indulgent French brunch. Croque Madame is delectable, rich and balanced perfectly with some fresh crisp greens on the side. With freshly squeezed orange juice and smooth creamy espresso this place has never disappointed."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Small menu but excellent dish quality and quantity. Will definitely go back if I'm in Calgary again"}
{"text":"Probably the best fish I have had in Calgary so far. It's a cozy French Bistro, great for small groups, or if you are on a romantic date.  The service was flawless, the chef was very professional and I could not find anything wrong with the whole experience. Try this place for Brunch, lunch and dinner, safer to make a reservation, it's rather small."}
{"text":"Review #29 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012  Cassis was hittin' some home runs when it first opened. And now? Well... now, it's weathered the Calgary climate and has successfully earned it's right to my 5-stars (which are getting harder to earn these days I might add...).  Consistently tempting me with daily specials made based on what's available in the attached market that day, Cassis always serves up something delicious. I remember one meal last winter, it was like -30 gazillion outside, and Gilles talked me into this duck shepherd's pie kind of thing. The ideal comfort food I believe he said it was. And he was right! Not that it took much to talk me into it.  On other occasions, I've enjoyed the daily fish, or the moule and frites on special on Fridays (double check that, I haven't been in on a Friday in awhile). And of course, there's always some kind of dessert to tempt even the fullest of tummies.  Always in a class of it's own, full of style and taste, you can't go wrong with the Southern French flavour Cassis brings to Calgary's food scene.  Tip: Heading in on a weekend? Make sure you make a reso. Cassis is tiny and popular!"}
{"text":"I've had lunch here a couple times now and the croque madame is soooo good. :) I also had a moules frittes today and it was a large portion and deeeelicious!   I haven't come here for dinner but I do recommend the lunch/brunch.   Tips:  - make reservations as the place is small - its a small menu, & may have a few changes seasonally"}
{"text":"A foodie's delight on date night; from the veggie phyllo anchovies appetizer, trout on a lentil base, the lamb t-bone on polenta, and the topper of a great hazelnut cream pastry dessert... all a treat of high quality, careful preparation, and great taste. The service was excellent as well! Not cheap but not over the top expensive either."}
{"text":"Delicious french food with friendly staff. Love the husband and wife duo! Food was great. Wish there were more vegetarian options, but they were very accommodating. Definitely a regular place for me!"}
{"text":"Went for the fish. Got fish, a very pretentious waiter and a very hefty bill with no liquor. Never again, go to a place where you are appreciated as a customer."}
{"text":"Close to home , didn't get in on the first try reservations help, went early ,just after opening no reservations again and were quickly seated for one the best early dinners we've ever had. Absolutely on the return and recommend list!"}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant!  Next door is a French market and next to that a wine store that specializes in old world wines.  Let's get my foodie on.  Fois gras parfait.  Followed by pan seared fois gras w/ green apple and fig. Ok, twist my hand. Decadent as hell. I pre ordered my cheese so it would be at room temperature. Tonight was pure fat, I'll be back tomorrow for proteins  Back for day two to taste what I missed croquettes AU frontage we're perfect. The owner recommended the steak frites. Alberta beef is special I was told. Anyhow this place was perfection in day two"}
{"text":"Cassis IS my favourite restaurant in Calgary, I always dine here during the Christmas season to enjoy black truffle season. Can't say enough about everything that this restaurant has to offer. The service the ambiance and the food! This is the true French experience in YYC. If you haven't been, you're missing out."}
{"text":"Visited this spot with my boyfriend on a whim after having it recommended by a local.  Managed to get a spot at the bar (I strongly recommend making a reservation - we didn't have one). Staff are very friendly and helpful when it comes to explaining any menu items. Both of our meals were absolutely delicious. He had the steak frites and I had a goat cheese salad. Probably one of the best meals I have had in Calgary, if not the best!"}
{"text":"Given 9 out of 10 by John Gilchrist on 7/10/11 - well deserved. Unique cuisine.  A bit noisy with the open plan. But delicious. Parking a bit odd around there."}
{"text":"Wow, what an incredible place!  It's a bit out of the way from downtown if you want to walk, but a quick drive if you have not downed too much wine.  I came expecting to have the duck confit, however was not available on the menu - not a problem at all!!  Instead they had a lamb confit which was an exquisite dish - simple ingredients but done perfectly.  Back to the start, upon entering in was greeted quickly by the staff behind the bar, and was seated quickly.  We were next to the back wall, which plays old black and white french movies - no audio but nice touch.  The set-up is very modern, and the tables are spaced so you are not on top of the one next to you.  Wait staff was great, a place where any waiter will check in to make sure everything is going well, pour your wine, etc.  For starters got the soup du jour, which was a puree of carrot, ginger, and a lot of cream :-).  Portion was perfect, and was very tasty.  Also got a mixed green salad, which was fine.  Entrees were amazing, as mentioned the lamb confit was a dish I will not soon forget.  The lamb was braised in duck fat, and served over polenta with some brussel sprouts and mushrooms - very rich, very tasty, very addictive.  Also got the pork dish, on the bone over a creamy (apple type) sauce which also had brussel sprouts.  The dish also came with a small side of potatoes in an au gratin type style which were perfect.  Both dishes were very good, the lamb confit was certainly the star.  Desert was okay, got the chocolate tart but they clearly had some better ones but the calorie limit had been reached by desert so did not get some of the other intriguing options.  The Bordeaux on the menu paired perfectly with the entrees, look forward to having it again sometime.  Very happy with the meal and feel fortunate to have it been recommended to me - I WILL be back."}
