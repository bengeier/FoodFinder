{"text":"Our all time favorite restaurant in the Mesa area!  We've never had bad service or food we didn't like.  They always have a wonderful choice of daily specials.  There pizza is very good and the breadsticks are over the top delicious!  We especially like the fresh fish options on the daily specials.  The servings are very generous so usually we end up with 2 meals.  Nice added touch is the personal door service."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza place. Last week, we went for our monthly Meet-up group dinner and it did not disappoint. Everyone raved about the food and the service. The waitress described all the specials (there were many) in great detail and we wanted to try them all. The portions are huge and the prices are reasonable. There is a nice variety on the menu from soups to salads to dinners and dessert. I highly recommend this place. And although they do not take reservations, we had no problem getting a table for 8 at 5:45."}
{"text":"Great place to eat.  Everything is good.  Problem we have been going there for years for dinner.  They have had two major increases is prices which I don't think is justified.  Guy's you better get out of the 18-24 dollar range for a meal or we as long time customers will stop coming.  100 dollar bill for 4 people to eat is too much..."}
{"text":"Have eaten here several times. Food is good, not great. Server was horrendous and acted like it was beneath her her to serve us, which was kind of sad really. If you go on a weekend prepare to wait at least an hour. Took 15 minutes for drinks and at least another 15 minutes beyond that before any food order was taken. If you want to eat at a similar type restaurant with good food and great service go west to downtown Phoenix or Northwest to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Everyone's reviews on this place hit the nail on the head.  It's a great eatery that just happens to be located in East Mesa, but it could be located in Scottsdale or Phoenix or Paradise Valley.    If you're hiking, biking, boating or fishing as most East Mesans do, you're sure to pass this place on the NW corner of Power and McDowell, which isn't too far from the Tonto National Forrest and the Salt River.  I swear they pump out heavenly kitchen smells every evening to draw in unsuspecting, hungry drivers.  It works.    The restaurant is right off the street facing South on McDowell.  It's a hop, skip and a jump to a Starbucks (that's 100 paces) and has a nice porch with misters for the summer months.  However, you won't be craving Starbucks afterwards because \"The Brew\" as we call it really pushes the fluids.    CAUTION: If you're bringing someone who has trouble with balance or is disabled or if you are trying to decide which heels to wear when visiting, just note that the floor surface tends to be quite slippery.  I'm not sure in which category the cuisine would be placed, but I'm going to say it's probably predominantly Italian American.  I say that because of the dishes, the pizza selection and sauces used and because this is the one place in Arizona where I would order a Cannoli.    Real, authentic Cannoli are illusive things.  They can either be filled with cream or custard or Riccota or a combo, which I prefer.  There should really be chocolate pieces and Italian cinnamon and maybe a couple Maraschino cherries inside.  The shell should be crisp and have a certain doughy cinnamon flavor, but not overpowering.   I don't go for adding alcohol or bits of dried fruit, but that would be an authentic version as well.  Red, White & Brew offers the custard/creme Cannoli with chocolate chips inside (no cherries except for one on top) and the shell is 100% authentic with the Italian cinnamon flavor.  It's something to split with your date.  It's rich like cheesecake and goes quite well with an after dinner coffee or spirits.  I'd jog in place for an hour for one of these, is all I'm sayin'."}
{"text":"This review is based on my visit on July 23rd, 2015.  I went here for my birthday and was extremely pleased with my meal.   We walked in on a Thursday evening, probably around 6:30PM. For once, midweek, this place was packed, which is very strange during the summer. We waited for about ten minutes before being approached by a couple in the bar asking us if we would like to have their table, a very sweet offer that got us out of that thirty minute wait. Our waitress was one that we've had before, a very nice, sweet lady who remembers our preferences on our orders.   When it comes to food, Red White & Brew has it all. Not only do they have a menu that features a huge variety of food, they also have a specials menu encompassing about ten entrees, two soups, an appetizer, and a dessert that change at least daily. The day before I had seen a Roman Gnocchi on the specials menu, and inquired if they would be able to make that still, even though it was off the menu. Our waitress visited with the kitchen staff, who gladly accommodated my request, something that isn't done at many restaurants. I also ordered a bowl of chicken, spinach and tortellini soup, which has always been a favorite of mine. Finally, for dessert, I had a huge slice of bread pudding, comped by our waitress given that it was my birthday. The food was absolutely fantastic and I left absolutely filled to the brim. I'm certain that the same can be said about the other members of my party.  The bottom line: I love Red White & Brew for being so close, being so inexpensive, having so much variety, and having some of the best staff around. I will always come back here when looking for a hearty, inexpensive meal right by my house."}
{"text":"The staff and the food were EXCELLENT. The Chicago pizza was very tasty. I am not sure whats in the crust but it only added to the pizza! Thank you RWB!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love coming here! Great good and great service! Yesterday we went there to celebrate our Anniversary! Our server Jennifer was amazing! Excellent service!!!!!"}
{"text":"love the brew ! been enjoying this. restarunt. for years!.....this. place has a real hertbeat. the food is fantastic .....same. great service as always real restarunt. feel try the daily specials. they r. assume!"}
{"text":"THIS IS A MUST TRY LOCAL FAVORITE!!!!!! Visited over lunch on a Friday. It was very busy and is regularly very busy according to the server. The locals LOVE this place!!! Really good Italian food with a casual environment. You MUST try the MUSSELS on the appetizer menu. The mussels were AMAZING! The best mussels I have eaten in a restaurant and they FAR exceeded my expectations. Usually mussels and clams in restaurants can be hit or miss and often disappointing but they were AMAZING!!! My mom ordered the pasta with sausage and fresh mozzarella; looked very good. They deliver garlic breadsticks to every table and they are sooo yummy!! Restaurant does offer carry out and the entire time we were there the carry out desk was busy. THIS IS A MUST TRY LOCAL FAVORITE!!!!!! Dish cost $10-$20"}
{"text":"Very nice, upscale.  They only offer a full menu for lunch.  Went there around noon on a Sunday and had to have a full dinner for lunch.  They do have burgers, so maybe that's there idea of lunch.  Service was very good."}
{"text":"Excellent, make sure you try the garlic bread. Beet salad with candied walnuts mmmm. Pomagranite dressing. Meatballs delicious and marinara sauce to die for. Will definitely go back and try more dishes from here. The walleye looked very good."}
{"text":"Love t Red white and brew! This is a great spot to relax on the patio.  I highly recommend it! We go there regularly."}
{"text":"Our family loves this restaurant. We go frequently and have never been disappointed. It's clean and their daily specials menu is always unique and delicious. We especially LOVE their fresh halibut cheeks!! They have very friendly servers and staff that even take time to talk directly with our children - something I think other places overlook too often. I would recommend them to anyone!"}
{"text":"Love R,W&B....The food is great the service is great....They always have all kinds of different specials and soups.  I have had pizza to salmon and never been disappointed!   There is a reason the line is out the door!  Thanks to all the employees for all their hard work to make this little pub a great success!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite neighborhood place for dinner. Bartenders are fabulous and the  atmosphere at the bar is friendly. We get great service and enjoy the variety  of menu items in addition to the daily specials.  My favorite salad is the Blue Cheese Salad with candied walnuts and dried figs but they have wonderful pizzas, burgers and a lot of great seafood specials too.  Red White and Brew is my favorite GO LOCAL SPOT in Mesa, AZ."}
{"text":"We came in with a party of 6 and it was our first visit here. The food was great. Pasta dishes are huge, delicious. Burger and wings awesome! And they have some good beer on draft supporting local brews from four peaks. Most of all Paul was our server and he was so good. He was attentive and on top of everything! What a polite gentleman and we couldnt be happier with our visit. Thanks Paul keep up the good work and thank you for creating a memorable dining experience."}
{"text":"the local north mesa restaurant. after 5, prepare for a wait.. daily. happy hour and a small but ok variety of craft beer and mixers, wine of course. bar is crowded usually, service is fast, staff is friendly, a nice place to take the family. i have been at least 5 times, and won't discourage you from going. fare is decent, specials keep it interesting. fun to watch the kitchen in rush hour. nice, open, friendly, and carries local craft beer. 4 stars!"}
{"text":"The halibut cheeks are amazing!  Great service and the food is delish.  The French onion soup is  a must, as good as Outbacks. They also have long zucchini strips from time to time and deep fried asparagus with a tastey dip!  The restaurant is pretty and it has a nice patio."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of the restaurant.  Number 1, its locally owned and directly competes with the chains.  Needs to be supported by everyone and is deserving of your support. Number 2, the food is good American fare that is very full flavored and pushes the boundries on portion size.   If you like your plate to runneth over, you'll like RWB.  Its consistent, good and filling.  Wait staff is usually pleasant and attentive (when they are not totally slammed).  The atmosphere is nice and there is a small bar to get a drink while you wait for your table.  Items which we order consistently and enjoy are pizza, mussels app (during the winter only), the steakhouse salad, seafood pasta, flat iron steak and yes, even the chicken parmiagiana which my wife and I ALWAYS split and still bring home leftovers.  They always have a good selection of specials and we try them often. Beer and Wine selection is pretty good for Mesa.  I prefer my beer hoppy and their selection on that front is limited.  Sometime's they'll rotate in a good IPA or at least have one in bottle.  Need more hops.  Enough said. Not bad on the wine list and its value compliments the menu.  No Lafite Rothschild here.  Usually a few rotating wines-by-the-glass as well.  Drawback is usually the wait for a table as they do not accept reservations.  Especially for large groups and especially in the winter.  During the winter, coming early doesn't even help as the 'winter residents' love the early table. I've suggested many times that they should set aside one large reservation per weekend night but alas, no such luck.  If you are here in East Mesa and need a solid, go-to option for dinner, RWB is your place."}
{"text":"Kim K is an amazing and attentive server which adds to the entire dining experience.  We just had lunch the food was very good."}
{"text":"Good food but high-priced for entrées.  Pizza is also good but pricey.  Nice ambience."}
{"text":"This is one of my haunts when I'm up in northeast Mesa.  The food is good, the menu has a nice selection and the prices are decent.  It is also conveniently located near the 202 freeway."}
{"text":"We visited this past weekend and although the food was very good, I did not enjoy the experience.  The service needs to be monitored better.  Our server was Nicola who was friendly and nice but needs some coaching. First, the restaurant was only 1/4 filled. I would like to suggest to find a better place for the servers to \"loiter\" than right at the kitchen counter area, in full view of the customers. They really had nothing to do and the wait time in between them moving from the kitchen area pickup area to the tables was considerably long.  My best suggestion is to pls find something useful for them to do.  Otherwise, they should be circulating the room.  I really thought it was off putting to see most of the servers there with down time.  I don't want to see that! If they have so much time, then the beverage refills should be automatic.  Instead, I had to ask for any refills.  The place was 1/4 filled only so no excuses-- this should have been automatic on their parts. Next, I don't appreciate the server, Nicola, clearing the table and putting food in take out boxes right at the table.  This is awkward at best and frankly disgusting at its worst. As she clears the food into a box, what does she do with the then dirty plate? She piles it next to me so that I can wait and watch while she does the next person's take out.  Mind you---I am still eating! Pls train the servers to be more aware of how and WHERE they clear the plates and how they move food from dish to box. Next, pls train servers--particularly Nicola--on approaching the table at the right time. I was still eating and she decided to bring a box to the table for my food.  I can't tell you how much this bugs me.-- other restaurants also do it. Pls train servers to monitor the right time to approach table and see if they are done. If one person at the table is still eating (in my case two of us were still eating)--THEY ARE NOT DONE NOR READY FOR A BOX!   It is pretty simple. This seems like a good suggestion esp when on our visit they had all the time in the world to stand by the kitchen service counter and chat. My suggestion---find something for them to do! Anything! Although  I do like coming to your restaurant but this past visit was lower in service quality than I have experienced before."}
{"text":"Very nice establishment!   Took a bunch of corporate folks here for lunch.  Great Menu and Great prices!   This was my second visit.  Keep it up."}
{"text":"Food is excellent. They always have great seafood specials that are always fresh. The halibut cheeks are a must order when they are on the menu. The service is excellent. Ask for Michael Bowen. He has been there for ever and always provides the best service and really makes the experience!"}
{"text":"The decor is a bit 'hometown buffet' style. Too much on the walls, over done. However, the food and service were great. They had 20-25 minute wait so we sat at the bar. Really fun bartender. She seemed to know all the regulars really well. We had the cheesy bread and shared a couple kinds of pizza. All was really good. No complaints."}
{"text":"I moved here from Seattle over 6 years ago, and this is one of the first restaurants my co-workers took me to.  I love this place.  It's consistent in the quality/portions and the garlic breadsticks are to die for.   Favorite dishes include: Chicken pesto pasta tortellini Grilled Chicken Sandwich Pizza's are all excellent!"}
{"text":"the service in this place is great. A little slow but that's to be expected when it's as crowded as it is and only having 2 computers for the wait staff to put orders in. Sometimes the servers are all lined up waiting to put orders in and it crowds up the bar area.  (Which is always crowded)  The food is for the most part pretty good! Sometimes the mashed potatoes tasted boxed and gross.  Staff is friendly, the manager however is the main reason for the 2 stars. He does not seem warm and friendly at all. He seems miserable. he dropped off one of our plates and smelled of cigarettes. Pretty gross.  As we left the restraunt we saw him repremanding an employee. He came off very degrading. The employee looked like they were going to cry. It just seemed like he was creating a hostile environment. It was uncomfortable.  Managers have a tough job- they have to make sure everyone leaves happy...including the people who work for him.  I never like seeing power tripping managers, they're basically bully's. (And who likes bully's?)"}
{"text":"I really really love this place and have been eating here for a while!! Everyone in my family loves it and its not too far! It disappointing that anytime we get take out, we always have the worst experience. Nicole has always been very rude and short. We go in there hoping for a different out come, but seems to be quite  moody each time. Its too bad, this is a great place and not so great customer service."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better spots in the area. Daily specials are usually great. Reasonable pricing, similar to nearby restaurants, but serving better quality food for it. Recommended."}
{"text":"The food is always amazing, as well as the service. Never had a bad thing here. The portions for dinner are huge, so I always have leftovers for the next day. Pizza is great for take out."}
{"text":"I like this place it is fun and nice portions. they have amazing pizzas servers are a little washy but that happens. deffinitly comeing back"}
{"text":"Everything was absolutely delicious. Service was on point all night. Very clean, warm & inviting atmosphere."}
{"text":"We've been going to rw&b since it opened, we live in Las Sendas never had a bad meal.  Alway enough left over for a second meal."}
{"text":"Dropped in with friends after hiking.  We called ahead to alert them that we had large group, but they refuse reservations.  On arrival, the lunch manager, Chris, was clearly not happy with the size of our group and verbably rude.  In the end, they accomodated some of us on the patio, and a few took a small table inside.  We were dissapointed that we couldn't dine together, but Chris commented that we were lucky to even be there,  Lucky to have the pleasure of eating at Red, White, and Blue?  Really?  Is that their attitude?   On to the food and service.  Our waitress, Jordan, was cheerful and extremely efficient.  The menu was ample and veryone was very pleased with their lunch choices,  A plus for sure, but doubtful that I will return."}
{"text":"Red White and brew is Amazing. Its owned by a local family and it shows. The service is great. The food is amazing. There are specials here that rotate, always something new to try! The regular dishes are just as amazing! Everything from the pizza and pastas to the steaks and seafood dishes are always beyond satisfaction!"}
{"text":"Soooo good! You can close your eyes and point to anything on the menu and it's delicious! Try the fried asparagus to start - so yummy! If you like garlic, the chicken RWB is a must! Great service and authentic atmosphere."}
{"text":"We love going here with the family.  The food is always great and the prices are reasonable.  I would give it 5 stars but the service is not always the best and the long waits for a table can be annoying."}
{"text":"Went there on our trip, should of done this review then. Everything was good here. Food was decent. The steak was a bit overcooked. The beer was good. I got a Stella... Should of had one of there house beers though. Service was on point. Manager came out towards the end of our parties meal to make sure everything was good, and our waitress was the best. Actually asked us how our food was when we didn't have a mouthful of food."}
{"text":"Never have had a bad thing here! My family and I come here very often and love it! Awesome specials every day, I have loved every soup I have tried here. When they have the Halibut cheeks on there special GET THEM, they are delicious!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We love this place. The food is outstanding a great place to the in-laws for wine and fine food. There is not a bad thing on the menu. Service has always been on point."}
{"text":"Nice service but the food is very greasy. Lots of cheese on everything. Also the bread they bring out is soaked in butter. There isn't too many options in this area so I've ate here a couple times, but don't think I've really ever liked the food. Lots of locals though come here. If you like the greasy stuff this place is perfect for you."}
{"text":"I was randomly in Mesa with two people who also have no knowledge of Mesa. We ended up here and it was fine - but probably not the place we had in mind.   Red, White, and Brew is like a glorified Applebee's. Lots of families, lots of wood booths. Based off the name, I was hoping to be blown away by the beer selection, but it was pretty standard.   Maybe the real problem was that our server was a little odd. Very friendly, but odd. He stood a little too close, came over a little too often. One of the odder things was that he snatched my full glass of water because there was no ice in it anymore ... that had been intentional - I don't like ice in my water and had been waiting for it to melt. Again, not ill-intentioned, but a little odd.   We ordered the pita pizza appetizer and it was cold - the cheese partially melted. Meh. The mains were all fine - but again, very comprable to an Applebees.   I don't live anywhere near here, but if I did - I wouldn't be back."}
{"text":"I Had The Linguini RWB Shrimp and Mushroom. The Shrimp and Mushroom where good the Linguini had No flavor at all there was no sauce at all I guess It was my fault for not reading the whole thing I just assumed that it would have some kind of sauce but It's ok this was the Second Time I been here first time I was disappointed too I had the \"No Bones Buffalo Chicken Breast\"  and to be honest if it didn't cost 10 bucks I wouldn't ate as much at I did and I still didn't eat it all. My friends said the pizza was good, I had a slice I wasn't impressed.. But to say something nice and the reason I gave it two stars not one was the service was not and the atmosphere was nice too."}
{"text":"Really good food.  Their pizza, chicken parm and spaghetti with meatballs are favorites.  There's often a wait but good things are worth waiting for.  Really large portions, usually good service, casual fun atmosphere.  Also a fan of their garlic bread."}
{"text":"Great food! Haven't had a disappointing dish yet. The pasta, fish, salads, pizza and chicken that I've had is great, along with the breadsticks...you will leave full.  Tip: It's busy every night! We mostly call in and get take out.   The worst part about this restaurant is having to wait for a table."}
{"text":"Let's get the negative out of the way: Kinda pricey always Busy(crowded)....... But the portions are generous &... The Pizza is Awesome, The French onion soup is YUMMY!!, & they give you these garlicky, warm bread sticks (FREE!), They have a great beer selection and the bar side has a great atmosphere. Been 3x, had same waitress twice, Great Service!! Just moved here for IL and this is our new favorite go to spot!!"}
{"text":"Second time here, food is great lot of choices,  services is good too. But maybe it's little over priced. Last time I had pasta with seafood and this time I took a ceasar salad and I added a 6 oz Salmon  blackened. (It was excellent! ) I recommended this place to my friends!"}
{"text":"We have been coming to this restaurant for 13 years and it never disappoints us. The food is fabulous with a large array of choices. Our waiter Michael is the best and this restaurant is always busy. We will continue to go back. We have never had a bad Meal."}
{"text":"Jan, 2012:  I went in and ate w/my daughter and best friend in 1/12 as RWB was suggested by a previous employee.  The food was so/so, but the service was AWFUL.  After an hour and 1/2 wait, we were seated in a drafty corner booth that was placed in front of a door.  The cold air poured around the door, which made my adult daughter uncomfortable. However, when they started chucking things at the door from the other side, we couldn't take it anymore.    When we asked to move, we couldn't find our waitress and another waitress standing nearby was very tentative.  She checked with the hostess, which wouldn't give her a decision, and then started to say no, as we saw two tables in front of us starting to leave.  We had to demand to be reseated, as they were about to seat someone that had just arrived (after we'd waited over an hour!!!).  So, we moved to another booth.  We received our food (which had huge portions), but the flavor combos were off.  The pesto pasta I had was covered with (approximately a cup) of sundried tomatoes, which seriously overwhelmed everything else.  At the finish of our meal, I was less than satisfied, and told our waitress.  She listened very attentively, and suggested we talk to management.  The Mgr came over (short caucasian lady) and listened to our story.  She said she'd get to the bottom of it, but we just wanted to leave.  She came back and said that the server we spoke to was new, and said no because she didn't know better (what?  Where's the training???).  She offered to comp my meal, but I had already had my $45 plus (for two entrees eaten and one to go) charged to my card.  So, she said she would put a credit down under my name.  When I complained about the wait, the poor service, and the food, she defended the food saying that they have tried to change the dish several times but the regulars just wouldn't have it.  About the wait, she said \"come back once the Snowbirds have left, and give us another chance\".  April 30, 2012:  It is already getting hot in AZ, so I thought I'd take a chance that the Snowbirds were gone and try to get my comped meal from RWB.  We waited just 5 minutes, were seated in a tiny booth, and when the manager (very tall African American man) came by to check on us, I explained that I had gotten a comped meal from our poor last experience, which was supposed to be under my name.  The Mgr asked how long it had been and I replied \"I don't know, a couple of months ago?\"  and he left to get the comp info.    The Mgr returns a few minutes later to tell me apologetically that the comp left was \"only $15\".  The interesting thing is that I had not told him that I was expecting a $45 comp, so it sounded fishy from the start.  I explained our terrible service, how I was going to be comped, and that the previous Mgr said that she would take care of us next time.  He flat didn't care.  He actually kept referring to the fact that it had been longer than a \"couple of months\" since my last visit (okay, it had been 3 months----big deal).  He finally said \"well, since it's been more than a couple of months, I have to go with the notes left by the other manager.\"    I told him to tell her that she has no integrity, and that we won't be back.  I took my $15 comp, and used it towards a fettucine alfredo w/italian sausage, which I found to be poor (too saucy, and the sausage had skin on it, which was wierd).  The bread brought to the table was good.  The waitress was excellent, and I gave her a fat tip ($11 on a $14.15 check), but told her we wouldn't be back and why.  She was sad....I am through with them."}
{"text":"at least the portions are big....the food is ok of the main menu, the specials are much better.  very noisy and often a LONG wait due to a lack of seating.  overall not bad, but they could improve a lot very easily if they wanted to."}
{"text":"Oh Red, White and Brew your customer service  needs so much work.  We had a group of 10, person #1 arrived at  4:40 and was given a pager and told we couldn't be seated until everyone arrived. At 5:15 8 people had arrived and you still wouldn't seat us.  After a discussion with the manager, he agreed to finally seat us but only a table for 8!  Within minutes, the other 2 people arrived with no where to sit.  Long story short, after an hour and 20 minutes we finally got an extra table (after being told they were too busy to give us that extra  table).  Food was good...but customer service is just as important. I won't be back!"}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp on our way home from Canyon Lake.  It was a good decision! Our server Kim was phenomenal and deserves a raise. She was very accommodating, funny and wanted to make sure the food and everything was good!  Definitely would go back!"}
{"text":"Consistently delicious food and reasonable prices. Try the seafood scampi- a delicious and garlicky platter of scallops, shrimp, clams, and mussels served over a bed of fettuccine. To die for! The complimentary garlic rolls are addicting, too!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service.  The onion soup is one of the best onion soups out there.  Prices are about average."}
{"text":"Insanely rude staff, been eating here for over 5 years. Never treated this badly. We came in with friends a party of four. We waited over 20 minutes, a large inside booth opened and was empty. We waited till it was our turn, asked about the booth and was refused it. We asked if we were in fact next to be seated and confirmed we were. Apparently the booth was being held for another group that came after us. When I said that was not right the manager told us \"if you don't like it you do not have to dine here\", while this was going on the other girls were laughing at us. She then told us it's our restaurant as we will do what we want, that's how it is!! She looked right at us, challenging us to suck it up and deal with this abuse or pound sand!  Extremely disappointing to be treated like this. We suggest some more mature management who understands how to treat customers. We left and had a fantastic night someplace else!"}
{"text":"This place has been a family favorite for 10 years! I grew up going here, had Ron cater my wedding, and now I bring everyone here! Great breadsticks, chicken Marsala, salads, pasta, pizza, and great service! Come early or late to avoid a long wait."}
{"text":"What I like about this place is that it is consistently good food, generous portions. It's one of the few restaurants in East Mesa that I know I can take visitors for a good, non-chain, meal.  I was there on Saturday and this is how it played out: Our attentive and friendly waiter immediately brought the super-soft, right-out-of-the-oven garlic buns. I ordered a Shock Top Belgian Ale and  the coconut shrimp with a baked potato and steamed veggies. My friends ordered Fettucini Alfredo with Meatballs, Steak Salad and a vegetarian pizza. I tried the Steak Salad and will definitely order that next time. Not that mine was bad. After all, the shrimp were more like prawns and there must have been 8-10 of them. The steamed veggies (varieties of string beans & carrots) were perfectly tender-crisp. It's just that the flavor on the steak was surprisingly, uh, vibrant. I don't know what they marinated it in, but it tasted like it might have had some kind of citrus in it. Yum.  We ordered two desserts - the cannoli which was properly crispy and the baked apple dumpling was cooked enough to soften, but not make the apple mushy. Yum yum."}
{"text":"Food is great. Service is great  However, the Manager named Greg is the most unprofessional manager I have ever experienced in the restaurant business. After two light beers, my wife and I were given two waters and told we could not have any more drinks after being seated and ready to order appetizers and dinner. Without any reason other than one of the bar tenders reportedly told Greg that we had to much to drink,?? I have never been insulted like this in my 55 years of life. If I didn't know better,  I would think that this place has been bought by an LDS investor. I will never recommend this place to anyone in the future..."}
{"text":"We went only to enjoy dessert and a glass of wine. So let's dive into that, shall we? I had the caramel creme brulee... it deserved 4 stars on its own. Deliciously creamy custard served cool with just the right amount of caramelized sugar on top. It needed more... snap to the first break of the sugar, however, it was incredibly good. I. Ate. It. All. By myself. ALL of it. I'm not ashamed.  He had the peach cobbler crumble. It was a 2 star dish at best. What tasted like and had the mouth feel of canned peaches with cinnamon added were covered in nothing more than granola. And there were so many peaches!! TOO MANY peaches. It was the ramiken where peaches go to die I think. The dish is served ala mode and where the scoop of ice cream is... there's no cobbler underneath. He felt a bit jilted by this. As if the canned peaches weren't enough, you're going to scoop out a hand-balls size piece of it for the ice cream?  We both enjoyed a glass of Riesling. The list is small, and nothing particularly eye catching... but they do cover all of their bases with a wide range of deep reds and light, fruity whites. I was particularly excited to see that they serve New Age!   All in all, we'll definitely go back. Hopefully next time for dinner :)"}
{"text":"Went for dinner.  Seated fairly quickly.  After our drinks were served, another waiter came to our table to ask us if we want bread.  Confused as to why we were being asked, because we have never been asked when it comes to complimentary items?  Anyway, our food came out also fairly quickly.  I ordered a salad, 3 stars and my husband ordered the bourbon salmon, salmon was okay, it was the sauce that was horrible.  Unfortunately, He did not enjoy his dinner whatsoever.  Our waitress also never checked on us once after our meals were served.  We most likely will not be back."}
{"text":"My family and i had dinner here last night and really enjoyed the food. The server was not warm though, he was in a rush and when speaking seemed aggressive, but not in a mean way if that makes sense. I wish the server or waiter in charge was little warmer. Other than that we will return soon. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Simply put...good quality food, large portions, great value. Staff is very friendly. Usually a wait at dinner time."}
{"text":"The food was great. We ordered pizza and an appetizer. The drinks were very good. Service was timely and friendly. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"3 stars for: gluten-free pizza crust, gluten-free beer and a great waitress  don't think i'll sit down here to eat again, costs a pretty penny for \"a-ok food.\""}
{"text":"This place is great! We ate on the patio. The bread they bring as soon as you sit down was fabulous fresh and hot. We ordered the coconut shrimp and the baby back ribs. Both were awesome. Service was very good. Will be back ."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. My only complaint was that the pasta was a bit over cooked but I really like my pasta Al dente, so this might not bother other people. The waiter was very friendly and has great recommendations."}
{"text":"I had wanted to come here for awhile because I live in the area but I was a little disappointed. I got the beef and reef. The steak was not very good. The shrimp scampi was delicious however. I would probably try the pasta or pizza next time, if I come again..."}
{"text":"My entire family loves going here. . The have many gluten free options and are always nice about modification and answer any questions"}
{"text":"Every time we've eaten here we've been very satisfied and most times we take home leftovers for the next day. French onion soup is excellent and of course the pre meal breadsticks are mouth watering."}
{"text":"Stopped in this afternoon for a meal before heading to the airport. Seated outside near the bar entrance.  Waited nearly 15 minutes for someone to even greet us.  Finally walked out.  No one greeted us either on the way out.  Poor or no customer service all around.  Went to another restaurant."}
{"text":"We were traveling in the area and our first visit we both ordered seafood dishes and were less than impressed. My brother's shrimp gnocchi dish was fishy smelling and tasting, my crab fish dish tasted like cheap frozen fish or old fish. However, the 2nd night we ordered Italian and were very satisfied. We enjoyed both the Mediterranean and the Caesar salads and then a pizza and a stuffed pizza (their version of a calzone). Definitely go Italian."}
{"text":"We don't have a lot of dining out options in the area, so the variety on their menu is wonderful.  Always good food and friendly service.  They don't take reservations so be prepared to wait.  The portions are huge and reasonably priced since you usually have 2 meals in one.  The place isn't fancy, it is crowded and noisy but there is something for everyone on the menu.  The bar is open seating so we usually end up eating there and still get same great service as the dining side.  They also cater and do a great job with that too."}
{"text":"Fantastic portobello, grilled veggie ,  cheese spinach sandwich. Chocolate cake with ice cream also great. We split it four ways. Why can't other bar establishments serve delicious food like this place does? If I didn't live so far away in Tempe I'd be a weekly visitor."}
{"text":"We love this place! The service is great and the food even better. We really like their Meet the Meat Calzone! It's usually busy at dinner time and you could wait up to 40 minutes, but it is worth it!"}
{"text":"Great service, food is excellent, bread is addicting.  Nice atmosphere.  very busy often a wait for a table."}
{"text":"Been to the red white and Brew numerous times for dinner never been there for lunch. Stopped in today and glad we did their lunches are excellent the special today was chicken livers with mashed potatoes it was awesome , my wife had. Lettuce wedge and enjoyed it very much. Also had the asparagus soup which was exceptional."}
{"text":"This place was jumping on a Sunday afternoon. Thought it was good, not great. The beer was delicious. The food average. I had a huge gourmet burger which was tasty but bland. The side salad option was boring too. Dining mates burgers were a smidge overcooked and their sides; fries and onion rings were better. I would return for the beer and perhaps some pub fare."}
{"text":"Call me crazy but I come here for the broccoli. They have the best broccoli in the valley, as well as an awesome selection of wine and beer! You also can't go wrong with their pizza or seafood plates. As far as service goes, the staff is always very friendly and attentive. The man that owns this place clearly knows what he is doing!"}
{"text":"Ate on the patio since it wasn't too warm.  The server was pretty confused at the beer offerings and couldn't explain them.  A little preparation is a big plus if the word \"Brew\" is in your name.  The waitress was adequate once we got past the beer debacle, but not tremendous.  Had the Sea Bass with a side salad, and corn polenta.  The fish was a little over cooked, the salad good, and the polenta was excellent.  All in all, worth another try, since the seafood menu was extensive for the region, and a restaurant of this size.    Could easily give them 4 stars if they tweaked the fish prep and the beer knowledge.  In fact, giving them a second shot tonight, and I'll be surprised if they can't garner 4 stars.  Give them a try and see what you think."}
{"text":"Incredibly busy - which translates to popular - hour long wait on a Friday night. Service was good, food was good, but over priced. Beer selection was good though they were out of the first choice. Wouldn't go back if someone else suggested, but otherwise wouldn't choose it."}
{"text":"Not as good as it use to be. We use to love going here, but the last year or so, the quality of the food has gone down while the prices have gone up. They also got rid of their wonderful onion rings!   We have done mostly \"to go\" orders because the place is so small, noisy and crowded during the winter months. The \"to go\" service is pretty good and friendly, but their area to pick-up is small and cramped."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely wonderful! We have almost gotten to the point where we didn't want to go out to eat anymore because we were always so disappointed with the food. Red White and Brew delivered with service and amazing food. We started out with the asparagus fries ( delicious!) and then shared a Chicago pizza. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"A very busy place, which says a lot about their good beer and gourmet food selections. Priced reasonably, and staff was very courteous as well as attentive. I've tried their pastas, and pizzas mainly and all have been excellent.  Not the place to go with a date for a quiet candle lit dinner, however."}
{"text":"o ya, they do really nice job and the food, ya buddy. Good pizza and service!"}
{"text":"I've been a few times, okay like 200 times and it's still just as lovely each and every time. The food is always consistent and well, the complimentary garlic bread is scrumptious. (Get yourself some of that until you can't move any more.)   I'm the boring customer that gets the same thing each time but hey when it's good why get something else?!?!  I get the RWB pasta, and to reward myself the creme brûlée. I did try the peach cobbler once but it wasn't my favourite, rather it tasted like warmed up cobbler that wasn't made that day but sat in the fridge for a day. But this is my opinion so, take it for what you want.   Back on the topic, this place is great and worth the wait. Heads up: You can always stalk the bar area and I've been lucky to have people leave after 5 minutes in the bar area rather than the 20 minutes for the dinning area. Oh and don't forget to sign up for your Southwest rewards to get some bonus points for your yummy food!"}
{"text":"This is a popular place and it gets crowded. The menu has a wide selection of food, the service is good, and overall it is an enjoyable dining experience. I'd go back again!"}
{"text":"Best Gluten Free Pizza I have ever tasted.  The staff here is the sweetest too.    I usually just zip in for a pizza to go, but their entrees smell and look fab.  Definitely the place to check out in Mesa,AZ if you like Euro cuisine."}
{"text":"I would give this 1 star if I could.  I've been there many times, and overall the food is bad and the service is worse!    The food is terrible, I ordered a cobb salad with extra avocado, that cost me over $15, and the avocado was spoiled so the whole salad was inedible.  It was to-go so I didn't bother to call, but when I told them a couple weeks later after the waitresses forgot our sides on two separate occasions, they told me they didn't believe me about the avocado!  The service gets 0 stars.  Twice in one week, both of the times we ordered to-go, the airhead waitresses forgot our sides (a salad one time, and veggies another time).  When I called, they suggested I go all the way back and pick it up!  Since I was at home, they told me they'd give me a $2 credit!   After these 3 horrible experiences (not to mention the bad food on prior occassions that I just ignored), I finally spoke to a manager, Eric, who offered me a dessert to cover it all!  (The sides were worth $2 each, and the salad like $15).    When I told him I'm diabetic and about the avocado, he said he couldn't credit me for $19 without talking to the OWNER!    Are you kidding?  This place has always sucked, but we go there since it's close to where we live.  Now I find out that they are cheap and don't even support their regular customers.    Stay away, and go to cheesecake instead.  The food, ambiance, and the prices are all better there!"}
{"text":"Great food. great staff.  great atmosphere... The moment you walked in you feel very welcome and they give you lots of food. Paul was the best service. Beef and cabbage soup was out of this world. Chicken club was awesome.  We found our new place."}
{"text":"The food touched my soul! lol  There is always a first to everything and guess what? Yup, you guessed it! It was my first time here and mmm mmm mmmm...  On a Sunday past 9pm, it is  kinda difficult to find a restaurant thats open a lil later than 10pm on the east side of town.   But not for Red White and Brew, they happen to be open till 10:30 which is awesome And they are easy to find. When we had arrived there it was about 9:45p ish, we were welcomed warmly with doors wide open my an elderly gentleman who also happened to be our waiter.   We had chosen to sit at the booth and they are comfy. But, for some reason their lighting was directed right at us. A little too bright that it felt like we were under the spotlight. lol. moving on...  The menu was presented to us with American classics with a twist of simple but yet great selection of dishes."}
{"text":"RWB is a good quality restaurant, regular menu items are always good and the garlic rolls are on point!   Has been a little inconsistent especially when they are extremely busy. But still better than any chain restaurant. The pizza is very good.   Our favorite regular item is the flat iron steak ."}
{"text":"My favorite local restaurant. Five stars across the board. I had veal Parma over linguini with peach cobbler alamode for desert."}
{"text":"Always one of our favorites!  Consistent and very good wait staff.  Food is always great no matter what you order. Be prepared to wait, they're always busy."}
{"text":"Great food! This place is amazing food is great and the prices our good!  Be ready to take home the left overs portions are huge! Happy hour at the bar is a great place to wait for your table.  Four peaks on tap!"}
{"text":"Red White and Brew is the perfect example of how a restaurant should be run!  The quality, consistancy, food portions, food choices, staff, cleanliness etc is absolutely impeccable.  Ron, the owner,  should give classes to other local establishments on how to run successful business.   My family has eaten here for the past 9 years at least twice a week, sometimes ordering to go food as well as having them cater many large private parties for us as well, I have never come across a better place to give my money.    The first time I ever ate heree (9 years ago) I remember be \"put off\" by the location, but please, if you are petty like I am, give it a chance.  You will have it on your weekly dining out calendar once you do!   :)   Cheers!"}
{"text":"Visited based on Red White & Brew's convenient Las Sendas location, the service was great! The menu is smaller, but still has something for everyone. We arrived early for lunch but by the time we left there was a line out the door and nearly every seat was filled- it's a popular spot!  Average price point between $8 and $15 for a meal- I think they can expand their menu a little bit, but other than that we loved it!"}
{"text":"Food was good. But name is very deceiving. We went in there thinking it was a hamburger and beer place. We ended up staying and enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"It was our first time at the restaurant however they did cater an event we attended at Christmas time.  It was very busy and we were told the wait was 30 minutes.  It was 45 min to 60 minutes however, so plan on the time frame given being off.  The food both then and now was wonderful.  I has the cheese pizza.  It was fresh, flavorful and nice NY style crust.  My husband had fettuccine alfredo w/chicken.  The portion was large and he said it was very good (he is a man of few works)  The rest of our party has the coconut shrimp and the penne w/sliced meatballs.  Both were very much enjoyed.  For dessert we had caramel creme brulle and cheesecake.  both are made on premises and very fresh and flavorful.  We will most certainly be back as there are other items we want to try."}
{"text":"Wow from the fried aspergrass  french onion soup  thru the perfect rare steak and shrimp disk to die for."}
{"text":"Have been going here ever since it opened. It is our go to place. Have never had a bad meal or lousy service. I have had just about everything on the menu, all wonderful. It has that small neighborhood restaurant feel to it. Specials are always top notch and different. Saturday they had a Shrimp and Avocado appetizer that was one of the freshest and clean tasting appetizers that I have ever had. Thanks for the great meal once again."}
{"text":"We visited Red White and Brew on a Saturday at 6:30.  My wife, two year old daughter and myself were seated immediately even though the restaurant had a full parking lot when we pulled in.  The greeters and waitress were friendly.  We were waited on shortly after we were seated. We enjoyed fresh garlic butter bread while we decided on our meal. My wife had the top sirloin and coconut shrimp and I had the olive crusted ribeye.  My steak was one of the best if not the best ribeye I have had and my wifes was tender and tasty. The vegetable sides were perfectly steamed and seasoned and were delicious.  Overall we were highly satisfied with the experience."}
{"text":"Fresh & good tasting food!  I have been wanting to try this for the past year and finally had the chance to.  It was a 20 minute drive from where we live but it is worth it!  Service is fast although they were packed. We've found a place where I think everything in their menu will taste great and satisfying as well!!!"}
{"text":"Wasnt that great of a place and I was really hoping it would be. The food was rather bland in flavor and was quiet frankly over priced for what it was. Haven't gone back since my first visit to give it another chance yet"}
{"text":"They have great soups and pizza! Their bread stick are addicting so be careful you don't eat to many of those before your meal gets to your table. Everyone is very friendly when you walk in the door. Good food:)"}
{"text":"Arrived with nine in tow.  We were expecting an hour wait.  Turnover at the bar opened up three stools and there was a bench outside.  Great selection of local drafts, also a nice Malbec."}
{"text":"Do NOT order pizza here if you want personally selected toppings on it.... kitchen totally messed my pizza up even tho I told ToGo gal twice exactly what I wanted... could not wait for another pizza to be made as I had people coming over to eat... so disappointed..."}
{"text":"This place is a must try !!! I have never had a bad experience, the food and service has always been good ! Every time I come here I find myself wondering why it has been so long!  The Chef is always funding new things to have on special that you don't see in every other restaurant which is so nice !!  My favorite thing is the salmon and sweet potato ravioli's !!! YUMMY!!!  Give it a try ... You will not be disappointed !!"}
{"text":"This place appears to be headed down hill, the food is still good but the bar service on Sunday afternoon wasn't good."}
{"text":"The most fabulous dinner at Red, White & Brew in Mesa AZ  Peach Sangria Half Salad - Mango Chicken and Avocado Halibut Cheeks flown in from Alaska with melted butter on the side Loaded baked potato Garlic bread  Very attentive wait staff!!!!!  Definitely enough for two plus meals!"}
{"text":"Excellent chicken Marsala and the chicken RWB is delicious!  Wait staff is attentive without being obtrusive... Thank you, Katie!"}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Cut the Stromboli in half and still couldn't finish it. Large variety on menu. They need a craft dark beer or two rather than Guinness. Did try the Orange Blossom beer even though I don't usually drink lightly colored beer anymore and it was pretty good. Still prefer a good craft Stout, Oatmeal Stout, or Milk Stout.   If we move here, I hope to make this a regular."}
{"text":"Red White and Blah. Went for the first time tonight with my family. Food wasn't so terrible that RWB needs to earn just 1 star but the menu was obviously designed towards people who favor size and quantity over quality and authenticity. Portions are humongous!! If that's what you're looking for then this is your restaurant, but if you're wanting something that isn't smothered in cheese to hide dull Italian food then look elsewhere. Unfortunately I haven't found anything that's decent which isn't in Scottsdale or Phx. Bummer. The search continues..."}
{"text":"It pains me to give a bad review to Red, White and Brew but after three bad experiences in a row I don't know if I can justify spending $40-$50 per person to be rushed through my dinner any longer.  First let me say that the food is excellent but quality does suffer from time to time due to the pace they try to maintain during busy times which gets me to the point of my review.  I would like to order a drink and converse with my companions a little while before being hounded to immediately order dinner and then when we do order appetizers, salads and an entrees we don't want them all to arrive at the table within 15 minutes of each other.  Which is what happened again this past Friday. We had to tell the waiter twice that we were not ready to order, when we did order the appetizers came out then five minutes later here come the salads (still trying to enjoy the appetizer).  Then while half the table was trying to enjoy their salads here come the entrees.  So while the food was good except for an over cooked linguine with mussels it would have been nice to have been given the time to enjoy it.  I get it, the restaurant business is about turning tables but it has to balanced with providing a pleasant dinning experience which has been lacking lately at RW&B."}
{"text":"Food was not spectacular, service was good but over priced for under whelming food. Won't return."}
{"text":"The food is decent and the service is fine but it's packed all the time mainly because there isn't a lot of choices in the area. Dinner time you will see a line out the door. I think it's a little over priced but not terrible. They've over packed the capacity a bit in my opinion. When its busy your elbow to elbow with all your neighboring patrons. If it was a little less crowded and a tad cheaper I would give it 4 stars."}
{"text":"My chicken sandwich wasn't as good as other things I have had. My better half had the special...meatball stuffed pizza - it was delicious! Service want as good as it has been in the past!"}
{"text":"Large portions. Great bread sticks. Chicken parmesan was top quality."}
{"text":"I found the best kept secret in Mesa on Valentines day. I was actually celebrating my birthday (belated) and happened upon this restaurant which I heard so much about from other Yelpers. I started my meal with the best martini that I have ever had and it was full to the brim, James Bond would have agreed too! The mussels were plump and briney swimming in a white wine garlic infused sauce that still lingers on my palate as I write this. The entree I choose was a 16 oz boneless rib-eye steak incrusted with capers,shallots,garlic and asigo cheese. WHAT A STEAK !! The baked potato was BAKED and not steamed and the side of mixed green beans were crisp and cooked the way veggies should be. I forgot to mention that the side salad with blue cheese was great along with the school of anchovies I requested on the side. My dining partner (female) had a great meal too, but she will have to tell you about hers because her satisfaction went unheard because I was too busy enjoying my meal, not the first time her coments went unheard (if you know what I mean). I had a great B-Day, V-Day combo and will visit again soon and it won't have to be a special occasion, just HUNGRY for food prepared by creative chefs."}
{"text":"First off, this is a great restaurant that knows how to take care of large crowds.  It is very highly rated (#1 in Mesa) but it should be rated in a particular category like brewhouse.  It is very noisy (we were there on a Friday night so it may be better on other nights), and we had to wait 50 minutes for a table.  The bar scene is lively but, again, very noisy - you shout to be heard by the person standing in front of you.  The selection of beers is great, and they have a full bar.  My wife and I were with a group of friends making a total of 8.  Fortunately, we were given a table on the patio outside the restaurant.  This was a godsend because it was cool, calm, peaceful, with stars over our heads.  The food was very good and served in Italian restaurant portions: BIG.  My wife's coconut shrimp was somewhat overdone.  My linguine with meatballs was very good. The salads were generous and fresh.  Our waiter was very congenial and efficient.  We might go back, if we are in the mood for crowds, noise and big portions; in other words, for a boisterous and fun evening.  I suggest you have the same criteria."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good on the weekend nights.  It has a good atmosphere and is pretty busy most weekend nights.  The weekdays are a bit different as I think the chef has changed or something.  I hope they figure out the inconsistency between weekdays and weekends because I would come here more often."}
{"text":"Holy mother of god this place is amazing! We came in for lunch very hungry after hiking all day and they did not disappoint. Very generous portions of amazing food!! My fiancé had the chicken parm and I had the shrimp Monaco. I also started with the chicken tortellini soup. Everything was incredible, the shrimp were big and they gave me lots of them. The chicken parm was crispy and the sauces for both were from scratch.   On top of the amazing food, the service was quick and very friendly and the place was very clean with great decor. We'll be coming back again and again, I've gotta try out the whole menu!"}
{"text":"Really good food with a large menu selection. The restaurant is pretty open and busy. Service could have been a little better as our waitress always seemed to rush off and seemed like she just wanted to get out of there. I would like to see happy hour until 7."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this restaurant, the food was fantastic, an I would love to go back again, But.... It is incredibly difficult to get into as well as being able to dine comfortably."}
{"text":"Their Gluten free pizza rocks. The food is consistently good. Place is packed all year round and both lunch and dinner. Wait staff is efficient but spread a bit thin despite every table full. Otherwise this is a 5 star place."}
{"text":"Hey!  I LOVE this place.  The two regular daytime barkeeps, Tracie and Pamela, are spectacular.  Most of the stuff I get here is just extraordinary - especially the soups!  THE FREAKING SOUPS JUST ROCK!!!!  Dudes.  I cook, and I can't get near their soups. Their simple Caesar lunch/side salad rocks, too, but needs a bit of extra dressing to be right.  Sad to say, today I had the \"Mulberry Street\" sompin' or other sandwich.  While it was mighty good, it was so salty as to be inedible.  Did they add salt?  I doubt it (they MIGHT have, with the vinaigrette that was spoda be on the side, but was not.)  It was likely just the combination of the Italian cold cuts they put on it that made it nearly inedible; it was DELICIOUS, but so salty as to be inedible.  How unfortunate?  I could not get thru half of the sandwich, and am not sure I will ever eat the half I took home.  The good news is that the \"cream of\", or whatever, sausage soup today was just OVER THE FREAKIN' MOOOOOOON, ALICE!!!!"}
{"text":"We have been going to RWB since it opened, about 14 years ago.  My husband says they have the best pizza and that is what we usually order but everything I have ever had there great.  We had introduced many friends to their eatery and all love it.  In the winter time the winter visitors usually have it really crowded from late afternoon to well after dinner time."}
{"text":"Met some friends here on a Wednesday night and this place was busy. Our party of 6  took quite a while to be seated. After  a few inquiries we were seated. I had a white sangria made to order by the bartender which was great! The place smells of garlic and bread even tho the menu is quite extensive. I had the pizza roll with meat and was it great. Wonderful marinara sauce I could only eat 1/3! I did have a salad first. Everyone was pleased with their food. A very popular place."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for many years. the salads and soups are so delicious. the garlic bread sticks are to die for.  the ambiance is great. a great place for pizza too. the bar area is fun with tv's but this is definitely a family place too and good for big parties.  you can also sit outside.  highly recommend - you can't find food like this everywhere.  the owner is originally from New York so he knows his pizza!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times, usually for lunch. Stopped tonight for dinner and had the Halibut and it was really good. Cooked perfect and good flavor.  Great service too!"}
{"text":"Red White and Brew is pretty incredible! Beer selections are wonderful and the food is consistantly excellent! Service and wait staff are good as well. I usually get the eggplant dish and it is awesome although when the swordfish is available, that's awesome as well. Apparently everything is wonderful there because everyone I've ever been there with has always been very well satisfied with their meals.  We first went there last yr. after my husband spoke to a restaurant inspector and he said it was very clean and the food was good.......the rest is history."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. My wife loved their hot dog sliders. By the way this is a very unique item. The hot dogs seemed to be of better quality then most and I've never seen hot dog sliders on any menu before. This item has bounced around from menu to menu to no menu and no they're not available.  Sorry to say but this gives us one less choice when we go to happy hour."}
{"text":"RWB has a nice, varied menu with daily specials that are a cut above.  They feature a variety of Italian items including pizza. The menu features many non Italian style foods as well.  The \"specials\" menu is outstanding in both variety and quality.  The food is very good with large portions and nice presentation.  The staff is outstanding.  They are friendly, professional, and efficient.  The management is caring and conscientious."}
{"text":"this place is near always on point.  huge lines but that tells you the food is good and worth the wait.  my only issue is sometimes when they run out of a side item they substitute something else similar without your consent.  i ordered the cheddar mashed and was given a baked potato (wasn't loaded even) as a sub..  but other then that tiny issue that happens from time to time the food is great!  how can anyone not love their \"poor mans lobster\"."}
{"text":"Hard pressed to find a better place than this.  HUGE, generous portions, great service, awesome bartenders, worth the wait to get in.  Comfortable, tasty dishes.  Good wine selection and a great place to meet up with friends, family or just a quiet night out.  It fits it all!"}
{"text":"Restaurant is very dirty and dingy.  Service was poor - food was poor - price was high.  Did not enjoy this place at all.  I will not go there again - hard to throw away hard earned money."}
{"text":"I was really pleased with my visit to RWB.  The service was excellent - our server took great care of us start to finish.  I ordered the stuffed pizza roll with meatballs.  I saw how large it was, but couldn't resist.  It was perfectly cooked with a great crust.  The meatballs were excellent and it had plenty of gooey cheese inside.  The marinara on the side is delicious, so much I had to ask for more.  I definitely will come back when out this way."}
{"text":"Our waitress was Mary and she did a fantastic job for us.  Along with the receptionist we were made to feel at home and welcome.  The dinners were fantastic which caused me to eat way too much.  Everything from the veal cutlets to the meat loaf to the best walleye I have ever had in a restaurant.  Thank you all for making our Christmas dinner an enjoyable experience.  Merry Christmas"}
{"text":"One of my favs tucked in a strip center off Power and McDowell.  Open grill cooking area, great bar area along with indoor and outdoor seating.  When temp residents are back for winter it is packed...although it is busy all the time.  Worth the visit or take out (especially the pizza).  It is a hot spot for this part of Mesa.  Always good and consistent."}
{"text":"My most FAVORITE veggie burgers & baked potatoes in all of the world! Oh wait, did I mention their garlic bread?! I can't say enough about how delicious 'the brew' is! Plus, the gals that work the front are the sweetest."}
{"text":"This is by far the best restaurant in Arizona. Everything is fresh made and you can tell in the quality. It's basically impossible to not eat a million breadsticks before dinner they're THAT good.   Get the chicken tortellini with creamy pesto, it does not disappoint.  Always great service and delicious food but the venue is a little small so expect to have a wait time. It's worth the wait. The outdoor seating is great when the weather is nice!"}
{"text":"We just left this place and I can only say it was very disappointing.  Saturday early evening dinner service (4:30pm).  Upon sitting, our VERY aloof waitress sulked over to get our drink order.  No greeting. No \"Hi my name is...\".  What she DID do was tell us she'd come back when we ALL figured out what we wanted to drink because she didn't want to make 5 trips.  Ummm...honey...it's your JOB!   After a bit, she brought our drinks with no conversation at all and left our table.  For a while.  Her whole attitude the entire night was like it was beneath her to wait on us.  (I think someone else mentioned this in a review, so we must've had the same girl.). The food was just okay.  Nothing spectacular.  On one of her few trips to our table, my father-in-law mentioned to her that it was our anniversary.  No \"happy anniversary\".  Nothing.  She just grabbed a couple empty dishes and walked off.   Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Popped in again today, with mon ami Monsieur.  Service was solid (Kelly??) and the blackened salmon was decent, but not outstanding and the peach cobbler was deelish, however, Hayley was worth the visit, as always ;-)   Pat Benatar got nothing on her fo sho!!!"}
{"text":"It's a fact I give a lot of 4 stars... The food is good and creative, they have good pizza and wonderful specials. The service has always been great and the lunch is really good.  I take out of town guests here, visiting relatives and one time a wayward monk and all have been pleased.  OK I jest about the monk. Try it, have a special, enjoy some wine - don't go to a chain restaurant...."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant!  Recommendations on dining would be the surf & turf (the shrimp is amazing and they should really think about making it a full meal) or any type of steak!  The bread sticks are absolutely the best I've ever had!  My one and only complaint would be the one time my husband picked up pizza for carry out - they were slightly rude to him while he waited.  The pizza a pretty good deal considering the quality."}
{"text":"The best place in Mesa for pizza, seafood pasta and ambiance. The seafood pasta dish with mussels, shrimp and scallops was fab. The kids loved the pizza and the Sparticus pizza was amazing!"}
{"text":"You just about can't order anything that is bad on the menu. Anything with meatballs is a great choice. The service is really good even for how busy they are. If you are in the neighborhood, this is a must try in Mesa."}
{"text":"One of our favorites. We order pizza here a couple times a month. Dining there is always tasty. Nice variety of items on the menu. Gets very busy and a little noisy but worth it!  Highly recommend their catering services for parties. They work with various dietary restrictions, make excellent dishes for large groups.   Try to save room for true New York style cheesecake."}
{"text":"Up until tonight we ate here weekly. No more! Service was poor, did not EVER bring my wife's salad and my baked potato was only partially cooked. They took a whole two bucks off the bill, never brought the salad, and the server never apologized for not bringing the salad. Maybe 1 star was too high a rating come to think of it."}
{"text":"My wife and I were in the 'hood after coming from a local business and were looking for a place to eat dinner.  I had previously did a bit o' searching on Yelp and this place looked like a winner.  So we checked it out.     As soon as we got out of the car, the beautiful smell of garlic wafted to our noses.  Mmmmmm, heaven (if you love garlic!)  It was a Wednesday night and when we got inside, we found it would be up to a 40 minute wait for a table.  We put our names on the list anyway and checked out the other option: no wait, if you can find seating at the bar area.  After maybe 15 minutes, a table opened up there, so we wound up sitting near the bar.  No big deal--there was a TV on, which wasn't loud, and the bar crowd wasn't noisy.  A waitress came shortly and took our drink order.   Shortly, a waiter delivered a plate of their signature warm soft garlic bread sticks to our table.  A delicious start to the meal!   We looked at the appetizers--several creative options.  We ordered the Calamari Steaks fra Diavlo, which turned out to be about the size of steak fries, covered with breading with a spicy tomato sauce.  The sauce wasn't too spicy, but we also asked for marinara.  Both sauces were tasty.  The calamari came out nice and hot to the touch, which kept them very warm, at least, throughout the eating.  They were nice and tender.  The only thing was I thought the breading could have been a bit lighter.  For an entree, I ordered baked cod with orzo tossed with spinach and sundried tomatoes.  It was a large enough serving for 3 meals (yes, I took the rest home).  The orzo, spinach and sundried tomato combo was colorful and tasty, and the cod was moist and flaky.  My wife ordered the strip steak with optional gorgonzola cheese melted on top.  It came with a triple serving of mashed potatoes--the real thing with pieces of skin in it, plus a bit of blue cheese on top, and some broccoli.  It was supposed to come with fried onion rings, but they weren't initially brought out.  When we noticed them missing, we notified the waitress and she brought them as soon as they cooked up some more.  I tasted them--the onions were nice and sweet.  And my wife's steak was cooked just the way she liked it.  We made room for dessert, getting the flourless chocolate cake, which was like eating a wedge of not-too-sweet fudge.  It was served with strawberry sauce and whipped cream.  A chocolate-lovers dream!  Throughout, our waitress was very cheerful and, while the place was busy, she was available when we needed her.  Nice, fun, casual place, with some creative and different ways of cooking some of American favorites in food."}
{"text":"In the past I would have rated this restaurant 5 stars. We used to order from this place weekly. Lately, however, I have been disappointed in this place.   The food is always five stars, that's in the event you are actually able to eat there. My wife and I enjoy eating at this place but realize that it is small, and often busy. Another option is take-out which we often opt for, because we live close, and can still enjoy the food at home. That hasn't been an option the last two attempts that I have made to order take-out because the line was busy. The first time it happened, I had to go to the restaurant, order the food, and wait 45 minutes to get the food.  I tried again on Friday to order food, and again the line was busy. After many call attempts, my wife and I decided to see if we could get a table. When I got there I was told that there was a 35 minute wait for a table. I went into the bar to see if there were any tables available. There was one available, however a woman who was waiting for a table in the main dining room was occupying it. We decided to eat elsewhere.   If there aren't ever any tables available, and I can't get through to order take-out, I can't see any reason to attempt to order from here again."}
{"text":"I don't know what all the hype is. Perhaps because it's the local hand out for the geriatric community of Mesa AZ. The food quality is on par with Village Inn, which is one of the nastiest places you can eat at. I'm beginning to think Midwesterners and Arizonas have zero idea what quality food is."}
{"text":"Great Pizza !!  As a Jersey Boy who grew up on the best pizza in the world, RW&B  can certainly compete with the best."}
{"text":"Great family place and awesome food always. Nice beer selection. Friendly staff always on the ball."}
{"text":"Great food fresh tasty with healthy ingredients. Presentation of food at the top of the list.  I definitely recommend this place to anyone.  Their menu has something for everyone.  Service is fantastic. Ambiance great.  Please open one in Arrowhead"}
{"text":"They were fairly busy but we were seated within 3 minutes after saying it would be 5 min The service was top notch and a very attentive server  3 of us each had a different menu item and each of us liked their choice   We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"This place was ok. I wasn't much of a fan of the atmosphere or the food. It was just all ok. The service was slow, but very friendly. The servings here are HUGE. You'll immediately recognize the regulars because they are the ones sharing one entrée. I ordered a pasta dish and they had to have emptied an entire box of linguine in the pot for my dish. And it came with two whole pieces of chicken breast. It was just too much food for one person. I wish instead of offering such large portions they would just give me a little less of something really good instead of a whole lot of something forgettable. The gourmet burger was pretty boring as well. But the onion rings were pretty good, plus!  I actually regretted not having just gone to Olive Garden instead. We won't be back."}
{"text":"My food was very good.  I had the meaty  stuffed pizza roll.  The servers were friendly,  and checked on us frequently. My dinner was plentiful and delicious! With all my favorite meats.. yummy. I  definitely would go back."}
{"text":"This seems to be a local favorite, however it was unimpressive and uninspired. We ordered a salad that was bizarre and carried a variety of conflicting flavors. It was akin to a toddlers mad creation. We also ordered a custom pizza with cauliflower crust which turned out well for the crust and average for toppings and over all flavor. For claiming brew in the title one would expect it to also hold a brewery but I did not see any evidence to support that and the beer was below average."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Phoenix - especially Mesa.  Always above and beyond.  Best menu and add additional weekly dishes.  Only problem long wait when the snowbirds are here.  Their prices are very reasonable and service is quick."}
{"text":"Always a nice dining experience. The staff is so nice and helpful. It's busy for a reason and the wait usually is not too long. Great pizza and fancy dishes too. Grab some desert and a few drinks and it makes for a good night.   Never been disappointed here."}
{"text":"Pan seared scallops, bourbon glazed salmon and fresh, hot garlic bread makes life worth living. I'm a native New Yorker so I've had some quality Italian food. This place ranks up there with some of the best spots the Big Apple  has to offer.   Flavorful garlic sauces, homemade tomato dishes  and fresh seafood is the staple of a good Italian restaurant. Please go and enjoy immediately!"}
{"text":"Great Food, Good Service...and to show up on a Friday night at around 7 and be sat in 20 minutes..wasn't bad...We will definetly be back..."}
{"text":"The brew crew was fantastic! Everyone was so attentive. Delicious garlic break and water at the table within seconds of sitting down. The chicken pesto tortellini has been my favorite for years. RWB is the staple of great, eclectic dining on the east side of Mesa."}
{"text":"A must visit for casual dining if you're in Mesa. Great food, burgers, etc. I had the mussels which were very tasty. Also a great selection of microbrews. Had the Tilted Kilt scotch ale. Very good! Come early or come late. During the dinner hour 5:00 to 7:00 they are always busy. Though wait times aren't too long."}
{"text":"A very nice place good food and drinks.we go alot well worth it. Very friendly people that wait on you and make sure all is good.. Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Wow is all I can say. I'm a total foodie and this place has so many unique dishes, I could eat here every week and try something new, knowing it will be amazing. I never order pizza when I go out to eat but their chicken and artichoke pizza is to die for. Oh, and don't get me started on the desserts! Portions are hefty. Great value for the price."}
{"text":"After months of trying to go here, I finally did.  I must day, it was worth the wait.  The chicken sandwich that I had was had a pesto-mayo that was fantastic, and the chicken itself was cooked perfectly.  Wash it down with an ice cold beer and you've got the makings for a good Sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"I have to say that I wasn't excited about going.  I'm not a fan of big places like Outback, Claim Jumpers, and the like.  But I was so not prepared for this menu.  I had Halibut Cheeks...and they were SO delicious.  Our waiter, Jacob, helped it to be an enjoyable evening sitting outside on this beautiful autumn evening.  His brew suggestions were spot on as were his menu tips.  There was not one person at the table who went away with a full, satisified tummy and a big grin on their faces.  My husband had a delicious bourbon soaked salmon with sweet potatoe ravioli.  I can't wait to go back and I have a feeling 5 stars are in its future."}
{"text":"I have been going to the RWB in Mesa since it opened and the food is pretty darn good.  As a vegetarian I have tried every possible combination of food on the menu that is vegetarian, but I typically will just stick to the pizzas and salad. The eggplant Florentine is very good too, but the serving is enough to get you through 4 meals!  That is true with most of their food, the portions are large, so don't be turned off by the prices.   I would have to agree on the comments below on the service; it's nothing to write home about. The only thing I will say is that I know several people who are regulars at the brew and they are treated like gold... so maybe there's something us occasional patrons are missing.  If you are area, I would definitely recommend RWB."}
{"text":"One of the Best places to dine in east mesa, the food is always good and service. My ultimate favorite is the chicken chipotle Chowder among many other menu items! Specials are usually a great pick!"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place. I definitely don't live in the neighborhood but if I did I would be a regular.... No Doubt ! I have only had the pizza which I thought was amazing! Not quite as good as LGO but you can taste quality. I would definitely recommend if your in the area. Props to East Mesa.....Never thought I would Yelp those words... :)"}
{"text":"Best garlic bread hot out of the oven & the Chicken Marsala was tender and cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"So so good! Diverse menu with sandwiches, soups, salads, pizzas and even phenomenal seafood dishes. Well-crafted daily specials along with a savory assortment of classics (burgers, appetizers, etc) and unique entrees (Bourbon Glaze pecan Crusted Salmon is amazing!). Definitely a neighborhood jem! Small dining room means get there early, or be ready to wait, especially During the winter months"}
{"text":"Add me to the list of people who love this place. Food was very good (I had thin crust pizza) and the service was truly outstanding. From the first greeting to being thank as we left, everybody was on point and seemed to actually like & enjoy having customers. My boss had the curries chicken and he thought it was great too."}
{"text":"Hadn't been to RWB in several months, celebrating my birthday with the Mrs.   Got a table right away on a Saturday at 7:00 PM. Amazing!  Server greeted us promptly and offered the specials menu.   My wife ordered a glass of wine, Beef & Reef with a side salad and baked potato. I over ordered, knowing the value of leftovers. I got a Papago Brewery Orange Blossom beer, Onion Soup, Wings and a BYO Pizza.   The Beef and Reef was good. Cooked just right and seasoned properly.  The Onion Soup was outstanding. Not too salty, oozing mozzarella cheese and a big French bread crouton. The pizza and wings were good, not great. I told my wife that I could find better pizza at a pizza place and better wings at a wing place but they were good for a sit down restaurant.   Our waiter then remembered our drinks and brought them, apologizing. The beer was excellent and a great compliment to the wings and pizza.   Overall, good dinner with a couple of slips."}
{"text":"Best place my boyfriend and I had in a long time.  The food is amazing.  We decided on starting with the Sheppard pie egg rolls.  Amazing.  A meal in itself.  For the main meal we split the special which was the halibut.  We have no words on how deliciously fresh the fish was.  We ended the meal with the creme brûlée.  My favorite dessert.  The best we ever had.  Service top notch.  Cannot wait to go again.  Perfect date night restaurant for us because of the amazing atmosphere."}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD! The service is super. While we waited for our table on a busy evening, the manager came over and sat with us a minute talking to our 13 year old. Made him laugh. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We found this place while visiting the Phoenix area and out adventuring. The service was friendly and prompt. We had all our items off their specials menu. We had a shrimp appetizer, tenderloin medallions, and swordfish. Everything was very tasty! They also had one of my favorite Rieslings so that was another plus. We enjoy finding something that is not one of the usual chains. I would definitely suggest giving this place a try for a delicious casual dinner."}
{"text":"My husband and I were in town for a wedding and were so happy to have stumbled upon this joint!  Their menu had great variety and as a vegetarian I had no problem finding options.  My husband liked the variety of beers offered and I had a delicious créme brûlée for dessert. The staff was friendly and attentive. If ever in the area again we would definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing. The hostesses, servers and managers are always attentive and very professional. Everything we have tried off the menu has always blown us out of the water. It gets busy during certain times of the day but it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Service is excellent: friendly and timely. Food selection is great with plenty of healthy options along with the other good stuff. Never had anything I didn't like."}
{"text":"Great food and great service...we were pleasantly surprised by the menu, everything we had was great.  The mushroom soup is a must if they have it.  Will definitely be back when in the area"}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to go when we are in the area. Always very crowed especially on the weekends.  Wait staff has been excellent in the past, but today  we have sitting for over 10 minutes.   Our waiter finally arrived and apologized for making us wait. As usual our food was perfect. Get the bread, It's like heaven.  I love their Cobb salad with home made blue cheese dressing. The portions are always huge, I always have to take some home. I wish this restaurant would open other locations.  Their location at Power and McDowell is so far from me. Would I go back? any chance I can I eat here."}
{"text":"When my wife an I want to splurge, we prepare for an epic journey.  Tempe doesn't have anything quite like Red White & Brew. The food is Americana... pizza, burgers, steak, pasta, seafood, etc... but better. Sooo much better. Everything has a little twist and is done really well, even for a vegetarian (its often tough to find good vegetarian food in the suburbs of Phoenix).  The half-hour drive is well worth the effort, and the 202 Eastbound at 7pm is conducive to just cruising and talking with the love of one's life.  There are no reservations, so be prepared to wait, as the locals know the place well (and I'm surprised that this is the first review).  They have a good selection of beer and wine, but since they have Four Peaks on tap, that is all I care about.  Some highlights, food-wise:  * Toasted Jalapeno Raviolis. These normally come with Ranch/Salsa dipping sauce, but we always request the Chipotle Mayo sauce. It's to die for.  * Blackbean Burger (with Chipotle Mayo)  * Eggplant Florentine. It's huge!"}
{"text":"Love the food here. Went for my birthday and they did not disappoint. The portions are more than enough for one person to eat in one sitting. Leftovers are always a good thing. YUMMO!"}
{"text":"After arriving in Phoenix, I met a group of other runners here for dinner the night before our race. I knew nothing about Red White & Brew previous to walking through their front doors, but I can now say it is somewhere I'd definitely visit again if I was local.  Naturally, it was busy since it was a Friday night, but our party of six eventually got a table inside (there is also outdoor patio seating) soon after I arrived. Having flown all afternoon from the east coast I was ready to chow down!  With many varied menu selections including steaks, chicken, seafood, pizza, pasta and salads, RWB challenged me with making a dinner decision. So, as a runner, I did the sensible thing: Complimentary breadsticks. Carb loading Build your own pizza. Again, carb loading Local Scottish ale. Umm...sure, carb loading  The 12\" brick oven pizza with pepperoni, mushrooms and bacon was excellent. I ate most of it with no problem and took the last couple of slices to go. This was of course after doing my part to assist the group with the tempting bread sticks that wouldn't seem to go away. Everyone else's meals looked very good as well, including the coconut shrimp, so I'd classify our group visit a pre-race success."}
{"text":"I recently went there with my husband for dinner at the spur of the moment.  Like many women I am always watching my weight but that night I was craving something I rarely eat.  We always wanted to go there so that night we went and enjoyed everything, thoroughly!  I ordered a beef burger with. Sweet potato fries and an iced tea.  The burger was cooked perfectly and my fries were sweet like pie!  I haven't eaten so well.  For so affordable in a long time!  In addition, my waiter, Michael, was amazing!  He brought us extra condiments, was so helpful to my husband on the beer, and ended my husband's meal with a complimentary little dish of vanilla ice cream!   I will go back there in the future and I would also recommend that establishment to anyone!"}
{"text":"I am sad to report that I was not real happy with the meal l had today. I ordered the ribeye medium rare, and when I checked it as the server brought it out the one end of the steak was more medium than medium rare, but it still had some pink in it. That was the only part of the steak that had pink in it though. The rest of the steak was more than medium. It lacked flavor as well. Most ribeye steaks are rich in flavor because of the marbling in that cut, but this steak was not flavorful at all. The other issue that is one of my pet peeves is that their salads have large chunks of everything. I should not need a knife to eat a salad, but so many places fail to shred the lettuce into bite size pieces. Since they serve the salad on a small flat plate it's tough to cut it up and keep it all on the plate.   Now my wife was very happy with the Mediterranean pizza she had, and since it was her birthday they gave her a cream  brulee, which we had to bring home because she was already stuffed. That was nice of them.   In the future I think I'll stick to their wonderful seafood specials. They've always done a great job with their fish!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to the establishment but my family comes here frequently. I was forewarned that the serving size was very big. Typically, my sister and her husband split their dinner and the same goes for my dad and his significant other.   We arrived here about 4:20pm and were seated quickly. With drink orders taken, the task of deciding what to order is at hand. I finally settle on one of the specials of the day. It was a  spearfish with mango pineapple salsa. This is a risk for me as I don't normally order fish when I am eating out but this one sounded so good. The rest of the table ordered their usual dishes.  I was pleasantly pleased when my dinner came. While the sides were plentiful, the fish and salsa were just the right size. I was even happier when I took the first bite. The fish was moist and flavorful but not fishy. I was able to finish off my fish for dinner but had to bring home most of the sides.  When I am back in Mesa, AZ, I will definitely make another stop at the Red White and Brew!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant, great service.  They have something on the menu for everyone and their prices aren't too high.  Make sure you get there early, or you'll have to wait in a long line.  You can call ahead and order food for take-out if you like too, but make sure you get some of their great breadsticks."}
{"text":"Haddock with scampi butter, sweet potato raviolis & a good glass of wine.... Yum Very good Americana, specials were just that- special !"}
{"text":"Thankful Red, White and Brew has stepped up their customer service! Received great care today and appreciate the attention to detail when caring for our table."}
{"text":"Great meals and you absolutely get your money's worth.  We usually get two meals from every entree.  Restaurant is always busy so expect a wait especially during the winter months."}
{"text":"Fun name, mediocore food.  While visiting friends his summer, I investigated on \"yelp\" to find places to eat. My friend Bobbi suggested this place for their pizza and brew. And, upon inspection of other tables near to us, the pizzas looked good.  Unfortunately, the taste offered less than what my eyes observed. Our party ordered a variety of pizza, pasta, salads, steak. Flavoring for the dishes we had were all consistent in tasting bland. Food portins are large.  Staff are nice, pleasant, and fun.  Save your pennies and search elsewhere for eats and drinks."}
{"text":"Great food- nice people and just a generally nice dinner out with friends.  Menu has variety and food is well prepared- big portions- so take home leftovers.  Ask for ~Trevor~ as your waiter- he's great, really nice, polite and helpful.  A+ You've made us regulars~thanks."}
{"text":"I hope you are hungry when you visit RWB! The food is cooked fresh and they give you large portions. Love the turkey burger and everything they have on the menu. I also had the chicken gumbo which was off the chain!!!!! Be careful of the garlic bread they bring out before your meal, oh my!!! Friendly staff and the place is clean and a great place to eat. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and have always gotten the pizza which I would recommend. Others in our party ordered fish and chicken dishes  and they seem to enjoy their dinners."}
{"text":"I thought the prices were awesome and the food  The food actually impressed me! And I'm hard to impress.  I like."}
{"text":"what i haven't reviewed this place yet and iv been here 100 times ...no serious at least, it is the best eatery in the east valley but my friends at Corbin's could really help spice up there menu. the food is good here but once you get use to the menu it gets old quick. there pasta dishes are over sauced or buttered chicken wings are some of the better ones iv had pizzas are good ect all the times i have been there and the owner has seen me he has never said hi,thanks for coming,good to see you AGAIN.........get out......... oh this place is usually packed between 5ish and 8ish again because its one of the few and far between better places in the east valley....they do have a great beer slection"}
{"text":"I've had the pleasure of visiting a few times. My family has been here dozens of times and love. I have to agree. It's a nice neighborhood type of place with a lot of class. Food and service have always been top notch. I love that they have a thin crust 'deck baked' option for their pizzas. My last visit I tried the chicken parmigiano with pasta. It was perfectly done and huge!   A simple touch that I really appreciate is that the hostesses spend their limited free time wiping down the menus.   They have great specials- my mom's favorite is the crusted Walleye Pike filet.   Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Good food and kid friendly.  Their kids pizza was enough for both my boys.  The lunch pasta was HUGE I could have split it with my wife.  Burger was just the way I ordered it.   Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Do you like great food, great service, and friendly environment? Than Red White and Brew is for you. I've been going the this restaurant for years never once left hungry or unhappy. They have amazing pizzas, calzones and seafood. If you want some place to bring your future in-laws to this is it. Their is something for everyone. Bring the family mom dad grandma grandpa even the little ones to Red White and Brew. I recommend the Meet the Meat."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Tends to be popular and reservations aren't accepted so it can be a wait to get in but, once seated, it's very, very good."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Twenty minute wait....not an issue , well worth it and will definitely return."}
{"text":"Casey was a 15/10 server.  We had a huge group of 15 people and she did an amazing job.  She got all of our orders on point, kept our drink orders in check, and constantly paid attention to our group.  We visit from Hawaii every two years and are planning to come back just because of her stellar service!  The food was awesome, but the service was even better.  Thank you, Casey for your hard-work and enthusiasm !"}
{"text":"RW&B is one of our favorite restaurants! The food is always fantastic and everyone is always so nice :) I just wish they would build one on the west side of town!"}
{"text":"This is our second time eating here.  Fantastic sirloin steaks that tender, not mushy, killer coconut shrimp, and the garlic bread warm-up to the meal is pure mouth joy.   Top it off with quick, in-tune wait staff, the manager will check to make sure everything's okay after your food is served.   Will be back again and again"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went here the other night for happy hour. We had the $4.00 house Cabernet, which was really good considering it was a house wine. We split the avocado crab and mango salad. The salad was OK. The crab was pretty tasteless, and the mango was not very ripe. I give the food just a B. Although our service there was an A+! Our server had our food and drinks out fast. I eat there frequently and the other night the restaurant didn't seem like it was on it's \"A game\". For sure I will go back they always have a really good happy our, yummy specials and delicious deserts!"}
{"text":"One of my Favorite places! The service is good and so is the ambiance. Love the Steak Salad."}
{"text":"This place is hit and miss.  Some items are amazing while others are 'meh'.  So far, I have really only tried their pizza and pizza rolls.  I would definitely recommend their sproccoli pizza roll (tons of cheese); it is yummy!    Keep in mind their portions are big.  To be honest, you could probably split a meal between two people.  I am pretty sure there is an additional cost there to split your meal though (a couple bucks), which is lame.  I would go there again, but I am not dying to go back either.  It is worth trying, but you may want ask your waiter for recommendations to make sure you get the right stuff."}
{"text":"We got takeout. Order was correct. Portabella pizza was good, but I'd probably leave the blue cheese off next time. Salad was good and more than enough for two people. They gave us a ton of breadsticks and the cannoli came with chocolate sauce and chocolate chips! I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"We ordered a couple of pizzas and salads for take out from here for the first time. My wife has eaten here before and had much better tasting food. This was my first time and the pizza was good not great. The salads were decent, but the pizza was pretty bland. Fresh ingredients from the taste of it, and it wasn't greasy. I've yet to find good pizza west of Chicago. We'll probably go again since the reviews here are solid. Maybe, it was just an off night."}
{"text":"We love the pizza here. I am from New York and it taste like it was made there. The server are all wonderful and very polite.  The garlic bread is to die for."}
{"text":"First, Jacob was our server and her was really excellent. Second, pizza was perfect for the six of us as an appetizer. Third, salads were great and plentiful. Fourth, my husbands favorite dish at other restaurants, linguini diavola, had the best scallops I have tasted in a long time. The mussels, shrimp and clams plentiful and cooked just right. We are from out of town on our way to a Styx concert and this was a great find! (Btw, I always appreciate when a manager stops by and checks on things and she was really sweet too. )"}
{"text":"Love this place. We moved out of the area 6 years ago, and we've missed it! All-time favorite: Gorgonzola salad, scallops oreganata, spaghetti (it's actually linguini) and meatballs, and their bread pudding is the only bread pudding I'll eat anywhere. We had a chance to stop in today, and the food and service are just as good as it was years ago :)"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch with great micro brews from Scottsdale especially the Northwest Crazy Bitch IPA!"}
{"text":"What else can you say about the brew? The food is always delicious and the staff is always professional. If you are ever there when they have the halibut cheeks you must try them! They are absolutely delicious. The only bad thing for locals is you can't get in the place in the winter because of the snowbirds."}
{"text":"Great beer selection! 3 IPAS to choose from, among other fancy beers! Great service! It seems all of the bartenders truly like their job. Great food! Really great food! This place has it going on!"}
{"text":"I stopped at Red White & Brew on the way home from floating down the river and let me tell you - this hit the spot!  The beers were cold and the food was hot! Everything I tried was good and the servers really know the beer. I tried several recommendations from our server and was more impressed with each.  I don't live on this side of town, but next time I'm out on the lake or floating down the river, I will be back!"}
{"text":"All time favorite restaurant.  The best quality, quantity, and price.  They have the best eggplant Florentine I have ever had.  (from a pure-blooded Italian).  I would recommend this place to anyone.  +1 for carrying four-peaks brew."}
{"text":"Red, white and brew is one of our favorite dining destinations. From the well crafted cocktails to the wonderful daily specials, it has something to please everyone. Service had always been terrific and the food is well crafted.Favorite menu items : mussels, flat iron steak, caramel creme brulee,smoked salmon, halibut cheeks and Yankee pot roast (when they are on the daily special) ,and pizza  It's been my go to place for ten years and will continue to be well into the future.  One little ding: they need to stock more premium gins."}
{"text":"Unbelievable food! We got there and were told 25 minute wait. We went to the bar and sat down immediately. We decided to stay at the bar and eat our dinner there.. service was top notch and food was great and huge portions.. this was the leftovers"}
{"text":"Worth the wait!!  Enjoyed the entries. Service was great!  All around a good experience."}
{"text":"Having been going to \"The Brew\" since it opened.. food is great.. location is good..  Problem is that it is loved to death.. needs a face lift.. it's kinda of like that favorite pair of jeans you just hate to trash.. but not ready to accept reality.   Way to many folks here.. and expect to wait at least 35 to 1:15 min especially during Friday to Monday during the winter season.  Also, forget trying to call in for take out... all you get is a busy signal or get hung up, on as the staff is working as hard as they can..   Need a larger place, more staff and a much better take out system.  4 stars for food.. 3 stars for service, 1 star for take out and minus 2 stars for size and overcrowding..  Sorry.. just have to say it like it is...."}
{"text":"The wait times get a little long because they are always busy, but the food is so worth it! It's delicious. We have been there twice. Once inside and once outside. I would rather sit outside than inside when the weather is nicer because the inside is super loud and there's so many different mixtures of smells! Service both times were great."}
{"text":"I'm a major fan of RWB, and not just because I met my husband there.   First, it's locally owned and operated. I like supporting local business when I can.   Second, the staff is generally great. Knowledgeable, friendly and helpful.   Third, the food. Oh my god the food. Let's start with the addictive garlic bread sticks you are given when you arrive. If they are straight out of the oven, you'll be in love. Ask for a side of marinara to dip them in and you'll be petitioning the state legislature to sanction human/breadstick marriage.   Craving mussels cooked in a white wine broth? These are so good, and definitely NOT what I expect to find in suburban Mesa. The salads are large (the wedge salad is more of a head of lettuce with the top and bottom shaved off), fresh and well made. I'm a huge fan of the no-meat steakhouse salad.   Their French Onion soup is great - but don't let that stop you from trying the daily soup specials. I have probably had about 10 different soups there and found them all incredibly well made. Their sandwiches are good, though I admit I rarely eat them. I tend to veer towards their seafood, pastas, and the pizza roll. Their egroomato is one of my favorites, but have them hold the garlic if you're not a garlic fan.   I think what keeps me going back to RWB on a regular basis is their specials. Their chef seems to love to mix it up, both for lunch and dinner. If you are there and they have halibut cheeks on the menu, order them, especially if you have a love for lobster. You won't be sorry. Just glancing at today's lunch specials, they have everything from a BBQ chicken salad to a cattleman's steak sandwich to filet of orange roughy veracruzana. You'd think that trying to play so many palates would leave you stretched to thin - get ready to be surprised.   I have only eaten dessert here a few times, and found it generally to be rather \"ok\", not spectacular like the rest of their food. As I am generally so stuffed (and taking home leftovers) from my meal, it's something I'm willing to live with.   Only major issue with RWB is the no reservation clause.  It really is my only gripe with the restaurant.  So either go early or really late (though even sometimes that doesn't work) or be willing to wait."}
{"text":"Alright my friend and I came here for dinner because its fairly close to my house. Our waiter was fantastic! Always was there when our drinks were running low, didn't have to ask her twice for something and she was just very polite and professional. The food was so amazing too, the specials are always delicious as well. I seriously recommend this place if you want tasty food with a nice atmosphere. Ive come here multiple times and its nearly becoming my favorite place to eat out at. :)"}
{"text":"Nice Atmosphere, Good Food, A Bit Out Of The Way.  So location is everything and for people who live in northeast Mesa this is probably good, but for everyone else it may be a bit of a drive.   The service was polite and attentive during my solo visit here.   I had the lasagna manicotti? It was actually quite good. It was a lunch special for $10 so I have it a whirl and was not disappointed.   The best thing about this place is the ambiance. It is a nice looking and feeling environment to dine in. It's very clean and tastefully arranged.   Stop in if you are in this side of the world...."}
{"text":"We moved to the area in January and a friend of mine recommended Red White and Brew. We expected that it must be excellent because there has been too long of a wait for us to try it. My wife and I went on a Sunday about an hour after they opened and we were able to get right in. However, there were people waiting when we left and even people eating on the patio on a 98 degree-day.   The reason: Crème Brulee. My wife's favorite desert and she said this was the best she ever had. I had the fresh Icelandic cod with macadamia nut crust and jeweled rice with garlic spinach that was better than my grandmother used to make. My wife's burger was not well-done, as ordered, but she really enjoyed it. Lots of good dishes on the menu and we just stared at the excellent food that was coming from the kitchen to the other tables.   The service was even better than the food. If you can get Rhonda as your waitress, do it. She will make you miss your mother, if your mother was an expert waitress. She had a bunch of tables, but I felt like she was just out of sight staring at us in case we needed something. My drink never became empty, her and her assistant Joey both couldn't believe we didn't want the complimentary bread - so they each asked twice. Checked on us often, prompt with the check and cashed it out before dessert was over. The hostesses open the door for you coming and going and are sweet as Crème Brulee.   It is very clean inside. I like places where you can see into the kitchen. Then you know it is clean.   Life's too short to wait - but I am definitely going back, often."}
{"text":"Food was good.  Service was great.  Decent wine list, creative menu, and really good deserts!  My husband ordered the enchilada meatloaf and really enjoyed it.  He recommends it.   It gets really crowded on Friday and Saturday evenings but it really is worth the wait.  I think everyone enjoyed their meal."}
{"text":"This is a local restaurants it's always very busy the staff and the owners are wonderful it's been in the neighborhood for about 20 years staff is always very attentive portions are large food is delicious the garlic Parmesan rolls are delicious we love everything that we get here normally on Fridays after 430 usually have a wait there's open seating in the bar tables are small but you can make them do if you're in a hurry they serve lots of fish dinner is here but the restaurant never smells like fish every single time we come we have a great time I would highly recommend this restaurant you can call ahead and pick up a delicious pizza if you don't have time to cook for dinner they also make a ton of salads The pizza roll is huge feeds three people easily my favorite is the meatball chicken wings outstanding taste like they were delivered from Buffalo New York  it's nice to have such a great restaurant in the neighborhood highly recommended"}
{"text":"While visiting relatives in Mesa during Christmas week, we went to RW&B for dinner one night.  My first time here, but definitely not my last!  The service at the bar was good, the IPA was delicious, and our meals were outstanding.  Our server went out of his way to provide excellent service to our group of six.  Cool place, groovy vibe... Thumbs up all the way!!"}
{"text":"Everyone  loved their food. The chicken RWB is amazing if you love garlic  mushrooms  and  cheese.  My hubby is pretty  picky when it comes to pizza and he really liked it. The garlic bread given out individually with the water is delicious.  Great selection of beers and vino.  Will be back when in that area again."}
{"text":"We came to Red White & Brew as a quite large group and they were very accommodating. I was a little hesitant to come here since I don't drink and it had brew in the name, so I didn't know if the food would be any good. Well I was wrong. I had the meatball calzone and it was amazing, probably the best I have had.  The complimentary garlic bread was awesome. I have heard the pizza is great but have not yet tried it. I will for sure be coming back ."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night. Ate at the bar. Great bartender and excellent food. Felt a little rushed but all in all, nice place to eat and good service and more importantly good  quality food. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I have only ordered Pizza to go from Red White and Brew, but I gotta tell you, I love this place!  The Pizza is fantastic!  Traditional crust and great, fresh ingredients.  Another nice touch is the free garlic bread they send home with you!  Pizza is priced a little higher than most, but always great pizza!  The restaurant is small but nicely decorated.  Full menu as well as full bar.  I would recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"Stopped here last Saturday and was pleased with my visit! Was excited to see all of the different options, they had a bunch of vegetarian stuff and also gluten free. I'd like to come back and give the cauliflower crust a try. We of course started off with the breadsticks and I feel like I ate about 12 of them..oops. For lunch I shared the eggromato pizza (I think that's what it's called). We got 12\" for 2 people and it was more than enough because the pizza was so filling. The pizza was a tiny bit bland and needed a little more sauce, but not bad! We got extra sauce on the side to dip it in and that improved it. Reasonable prices here too. My only complaint, aside from slightly bland pizza, was that our server seemed mad at us. I'm not sure why but I noticed that as did the person I was dining with. She still did a good job, got us everything on time, just seemed frustrated for some reason. Overall a good experience though and I'd come back."}
{"text":"I go here at least twice a month, if not weekly on tuesdays, with a large group of  regulars. It's always packed and for good reason. The \"meet the meat\" is AMAZING! If you have not had this, and give this place a poor review... You fail. It is seriously one of my favorite spots for a Good casual diner and a tall Blue moon."}
{"text":"Raising my previous rating to 4 stars, primarily because the bulk of great service and great meals as dine-in have overshadowed the hit-or-miss takeout experiences I've had. I've had a few mediocre meals and a few outstanding ones. Never a bad meal, which is a pretty good accomplishment after 35 or so visits."}
{"text":"I was thoroughly impressed with Red, White, and Brew. The portions were gracious, the service was unbelievable, and most importantly, the food was great. I would definitely recommend this to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"We recently had lunch here. Despite being quite busy, we were seated right away. Our server was very helpful and friendly. Our meals were brought out quickly. We both ordered fish & chips, portions were generous and the fish prepared just right. We plan on visiting again."}
{"text":"I don't think I can say how much I love this place! Flat iron steak for lunch and mussels for appetizer.. Wow! Not too pricy either, which I was surprised. My new favorite place.!  My sisters had a chicken sandwich had juicy chicken, a large slice of buffalo mozzarella, half a roasted red pepper, and pesto spread on ciabatta they also ordered the kilt lifter  beer, which went great with their meal. ( I don't drink so I couldn't say for myself ).  I want to come back for a date night with hubby :) great service, great food, and just when you want something a little special. We came for lunch so there wasn't much of a crowd but dinner gets very crowded, they don't take reservations which  is the only bad part, you have to just wait."}
{"text":"The bourbon salmon is so so good! I get it without pecans and end up sharing it with my son, and we love it. The kids meals include fish also which is amazing! My kids have tried several types of fish here and liked them all. They have great pizza and a flavorful Caesar salad also. Don't forget the garlic knots (lots of power behind that garlic). They are always so so busy! My only complaint would be that they need a larger space and more staff so you don't have to wait an hour. Worth the wait tho!!!"}
{"text":"Took my staff in today for lunch. When the food came we began to pray. The waitress took this moment to fill up water glasses. When asked if she knew we were praying she said yes and that she was trying to be quiet.  Have visited here many times, have never had such disrespect from a server before."}
{"text":"RWB is definitely a go to spot in northeast Mesa. It's a well-run restaurant that caters to locals, families and the snowbirds.  The pizza is the best in town.  They have fish specials every day. They have an amazing pickled chicken sandwich special that they don't run enough. The bar is really nice and their bartender Pamela is number one."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is a nice pub like setting. We got the pesto chicken and bolognese and it was very good. It was served with warm garlic Parmesan sticks. The best part of our dinner was the Paul our server. He was super attentive, and friendly we absolutely loved him."}
{"text":"Gluten free buns, pizza and a couple dessert choices are offered. This restaurant definitely has seafood and side dishes that are above and beyond burgers at most suburban bars. Friendly staff. No wait mid afternoon on a Thursday."}
{"text":"How can anyone rate this place less than 5 stars?  We have been coming here since they opened.  Even when we moved to gilbert we still tried to find our way here a few times a year, just to get our RWB fix.  The food is excellent and kinda unique for the area.  Definitely not bar food. I honestly cant rate the actual menu because i almost always order one of their specials, which vary weekly.  Service is always attentive from wait staff , hosts and even the busers.  The only negative is the restaurant is way too small for how popular they are.  Getting in during peak times is usually a very long wait.  So we do try to visit during off times."}
{"text":"My parents live in the neighborhood behind Red White and Brew and thus we have eaten here many many times. In my opinion the best thing they have is their pizzas, we would always order in and pick them up. They are large and thin with great crusts and sauce. I love the garlic bread nubs that come with the pizza. When we dine in I like to get the black bean burger with their chipotle mayo, it is spicy and hearty. I love their specials, my favorite thus far has been their asparagus fries. I also enjoy their selection of beer, my favorite being a blueberry brew they once had and an octoberfest beer. I like RWB but I wish they didn't get so busy and had a larger building. There is almost always a wait at dinner, hence the calling in pizza."}
{"text":"I don't understand how this place got such rave reviews. I really don't.  When hubby and I went, it was some of the worst food and service we've received in a long, long time.  The beer selection was deplorable (by hubby's standards) and the food fell even worse. I think our server knew hubby was going to be fussy because she made sure she was never available. She took our order and literally ran away, only to reappear to put food on the table (an extra star was given because she didn't PLONK or slap it down onto the table) and then...give us our check after we'd been left thirsty. She never asked how food was and was barely civil.  I'll tell you how the food was - forgettable, like the rest of this place.  Will we give this place another chance? Nope. What a pity...I thought this place was so cute when I walked in. Too bad service and food won't entice me back."}
{"text":"I love this place. From the time we walked in to paying the check the whole experience was super. The girls at the door were focused on moving people to their seats. The waiting staff were busting it to each table. Taking order as well as drink orders. The food was out standing as well. I will be back."}
{"text":"Too long of a wait for a Monday night. They should take reservations. Nice selection of drinks and food but really inconsistent quality of the food. Our impossible burger came without cheese or sauce so we had to send it back and then they put cheese on it and over cooked it so it was very dry. Bun was super dry too. Others in our party had good fish and burger though so hit or miss it seems. Service was up to standards but nothing special. So, it's ok but not overly impressive."}
{"text":"Okay...so you get a HUGE portion so make sure you're hungry when you go! The bread sticks and sauce is SUPER tasty, but to be honest, the chicken parmigiana was so-so. the breading on the chicken was mushy and the flavor was bland. The pasta was perfectly cooked, but I wish the meat and overall flavor was better. The waitress was pretty much MIA for most of the meal which wasn't helpful.  I'll probably go again to give this place another try, but I'm hoping my experience will be better."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch on a Sunday after hiking at Usery park.  I liked the fresh garlic butter rolls they give you before your meal, better than the food I ordered.  I had the Portobello Sandwich.  Didn't care for it.  So much liquid poured out of the sandwich.  Made the bottom bread soggy and was also very salty and rich tasting, which is strange for a Portobello sandwich.  The BF loved his Chicken Jambalaya though.  He can never order Jambalaya because it always has shrimp in it and he has a seafood allergy.  But they had one without shrimp and he said it was fantastic.  My mom enjoyed her veggie burger....even though it was the chipotle gardenburger from Costco.  Service was good and the ambiance was nice enough.  Wouldn't make a special trip to go back though."}
{"text":"A fantastic place with a great atmosphere, prompt friendly service, and delicious food! It can be super busy for lunch and dinner so plan ahead."}
{"text":"Great service. Great good. Fabulous clam chowder and French onion soup. Great steak salad and amazing coconut shrimp.  Portions are large and price is reasonable."}
{"text":"Very friendly and relaxing establishment Great Service you will be happy inside or outside. Lunch or Dinners. You can't go wrong either way."}
{"text":"RWB is NOT just a beer joint, don't let the name fool you. They have great food selections and good service. We have had a couple of uh ohs, so I couldn't give them 5 stars...but we still love it and will go back.   Their special recipes are delicious!"}
{"text":"On 9/11 my boyfriend and I ate dinner here and had an awesome experience.  We were seated in only a few minutes and Colton asked if we wanted garlic bread.  It was great.  We had Rhonda as the waitress, Jacobo brought our food, and Josh and Edwardo were on the grill.  Amazing service from all.  Rhonda has the best smile and was so nice.  Our appetizers were Asparagus fries and Jumbo coconut shrimp.  Perfectly cooked.  Our dinner was Beef and Reef and the Broiled Captains Platter.  Again perfectly cooked.  Nicole the manager was very attentive. The building was clean and the restaurant while a little loud you could still talk to your partner.  Thank you for a great meal!!!"}
{"text":"I had first heard about RWB from a co-worker. It was also featured on \"Check Please\" and we were not disappointed. From the bread they started with to the Chicago pizza, Coconut shrimp and a side of the spinach all were a large portions, piping hot and and full of flavor. The menu is huge and Michael our waiter was very knowledgable and helpful with our choices and even brought samples of some of the special without us asking. Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"First time in, went for lunch and had a short wait that was more than worth it.. the service was great and the food was better than I expected. I'll definitely return again and again! So happy to find this gem right in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"This is our neighborhood place to go....and we only go here 2-3 times a year only because we can't get in.  The wait sometimes is so long we go elsewhere.  So, we manage to come the  \"in between\" times.  The food here has always been consistent...which is what you want.  Large portions and they have daily specials which is great.  The food is great!  I love their salads, we have had their fried asparagus, onion rings-yum and my most favorite coconut shrimp.  Their chicken anything is always good and pasta.   This place has great comfort food.  The staff....always wonderful.  They are top notch and always friendly, great suggestions, not afraid to tell you...my favorite is....  The bar serves great brews and a good wine selection.  OH...and if it's your birthday nice little touch, dessert is on them."}
{"text":"I tried red white and brew for my first time today. The food was delicious although the service was terrible. The server took about 15 minutes to get our drink order.  She never refilled our drinks,  our food took a long time, and we had a huge beetle land on our food (we were sitting outside). My co worker did not get to finish her food because of the beetle. The server than told us she will take the meal off the bill. and did not. Instead the manager only took half of the meal off. Overall, not bad food."}
{"text":"Everyone at our table raved about their meals, the appetizers were wonderful and our deserts were amazing.  Glad we found this place-it was worth the 25 mile drive! We will come again next time we're in the valley."}
{"text":"I was starving for a steak-- a friend said to try RWB. I brought my daughter and we were not disappointed. I had the ribeye and  she had the sirloin with coconut shrimp. The waiter (Michael) suggested we have the steaks crusted. We did, they were cooked perfectly, crusted with a garlicky olive tapenade then broiled. Pure perfection. Bread was delicious as were our sides. In truth though, the salad was just so so, not 5 star but the rest of the meal made up for it. Ended up seeing friends there and having a wonderful night. Thanks Red White And Brew for scratching my steak itch."}
{"text":"After hearing about this place, we checked it out on St. Patrick's day! It was filled with revellers, all of whom were partaking in the festive atmosphere and  enjoying the fine food. We were not disappointed. Fantastic!"}
{"text":"This place is really nice! A lil bit small but we didn't wait too long. Our server was really nice and knowledgable on her beer selection. The food here is big!! You do get what you paid for. I ordered the Alfredo Fettichine with sausage and it was delicious and I had left overs the next day. They also give you complimentary bread rolls and they are heavenly. We also ordered a Creme Brulee and boy, oh, boy was it good. Overall, I like this place, might be a lil bit more expensive. Definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"We have been coming here since it opened but stopped going over the past few years after a couple bad experiences with service and quality of food going downhill. Last night brought back hope. We were seated within 20 mins of waiting at 5:00 on a tues. Staff immediately brought garlic Parmesan sticks to table. Waiter was quick and checked back often. Had 2 employees/managers on top of waiter stop to check on things one even asking my 6 yr old how she liked her meal. French onion soup was fantastic. My go to meal since they have opened has been the chicken Romano. It had gone downhill for awhile but seems to be almost perfect again just needed a little more lemon flavor. Their pizza used to be excellent so looking forward to giving that another shot soon too to see if that is back up to par. Happy to be back!"}
{"text":"Been here once. Didn't expect the atmosphere. Based on the name we expected a sports bar environment however very surprised with the winery bistro feel. Very limited menu. Wasn't in the mood for a burger but that's all there was."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times for work lunches. So far, I have not been impressed. It is very noisy and the food is just okay. I don't think it is bad, but not good.   The first time I had them, it was a working lunch at the office and we had someone pick it up for us, two of us ordered hamburgers and one ordered steak. They did not include any condiments for the hamburgers and the steak was over cooked. I chalked that up to us doing a to go order at a place that is not made for to go orders.   I have since been there a few more times ordering either a hamburger or a steak salad and the food is what I would consider normal, not bad, not good. I would not personally choose to come here, but if I am feeling indifferent and someone else wants to go, then that is fine.   Today I went for lunch and ordered the steak salad, but the steak was very tough. I literally broke out a sweat trying to cut it up. It tasted fine, and looked like it was cooked medium rare like I asked, but almost impossible to cut.   I would still come here, but like I said, it would only be for lunch and if someone else suggested it when I am feeling indecisive."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Just had one of the best lunches ever. We walking up to the door and it swung open with a wonderful greeting by the hostess. We were sat immediately and our server, Kyle, was prompt and extremely friendly.  All of the food was too good, I had the pizza and it was one of the best I have had. My mother enjoyed her spaghetti and meatballs and my father tried the halibut cheeks and they were unbelievable!  The beer was ice cold and brought out quickly. This restaurant knows how to make customers happy. We are already planning on viviting next week. Way to go Red White and Brew!"}
{"text":"I have been hearing about this place for months now, but it is so far from where I live I just haven't been able to get out there. So when I had to meet up with someone in East Mesa, she suggested RW&B.  We got there early for lunch on a Thursday (11:30) and glad we did because it filled up quickly! The service was great...the manager was opening the doors for people and welcoming them when we arrived. Our server was prompt and pleasant. We checked out the menu, and although this place is known for the fish, I had the California Turkey Burger and my friend the house salad with chicken added. The burger was perfect and served with provolone, roasted red peppers and avocados along with a delicious garlic/sundried tomato aioli on the side.  Although this place is far far away, I know I will be back to try the dinners....can't wait!"}
{"text":"Usually I have really amazing experiences here, but this time it was a totally different story. I love this place, their ever changing seasonal menu is something spectacular. The whole kitchen staff should be proud of what they create, and this has nothing to do with the kitchen staff.   Decor: Very modern, warm, and overall welcoming. They have seating in both the patio, bar, and dining room tables/booths. Love the entire feel of this place, relaxes you as soon as you walk in.  Food: This is one of the main reasons I will come back. I love the food here. The flavors are always spot on, and the seasonal menu makes me always want to return. I usually have the Halibut cheeks whenever possible. Something you'll have to try!  Customer Service: This is where things fell apart for me. I came in tonight, 6/20, for my birthday dinner with my 6 year old daughter. When the waiter arrived, the normal routine kicks in. This time around, it completely felt like I was not wanted, or he didn't care for the table. As someone who is a chef, I know how customer service should be. My daughter was supposed to get ice cream, didn't happen. No happy birthday at all from the waiter. I asked for a box for myself, and the check came as my daughter was still eating. I wasn't even asked for dessert. It felt so much like he wanted me out so a new table could be sat and turned for a bigger check. This really threw me off. I NEVER have any bad experiences here.   Overall: I really hope this gets addressed because this is the type of service that can cost a local to never come back. I shouldn't be judged by the amount of people, or who comes through the door. Everyone is a customer, regardless of the check/tip ratio. I know the game, and it's sad it felt like this was the more important factor. I really hope my next dinner isn't as bad, or else I will never come back."}
{"text":"We've been going to RW&B for years and have always loved the place, but the last two times we were there have been a downhill experience. Customer service, which was previously top notch seems to be slipping. They used to have a guy who did nothing but run around and make sure everything ran smoothly. He worked hard and did a wonderful job. Not sure what happened to him. Now it seems chaotic. Our waiter (who was new and inexperienced) didn't take back the menus after taking our order. Apparently they ran out of glasses (although everyone else had them?) so he our served drinks in styrofoam cups and one leaked all over. When we were finally able to catch the server's eye to tell him about the leak he replaced the cup but never even thought to wipe up the obvious mess on the table. We had to request their famous breadsticks which are usually brought out immediately, and when we asked for seconds they took our used plates up to replenish (community tongs touched our dirty plates; one that included a wad of gum!) rather than just bringing a fresh plate like they usually do. The ingredients in the calzone were tasty, but they weren't spread equally throughout so the ends were mostly bread while the middle was overloaded. I ordered my usual, the fettuccine alfredo w/chicken and asked that my side (broccoli) be cut up and added to the pasta. Instead of cutting it up nicely like they normally do, the chef just plopped huge clusters of broccoli on top, and the alfredo was lacking in flavor. Not sure what's going on here, but this used to be one of our favorite places. While this restaurant is always very busy, they typically handle things smoothly and professionally. Lately, the wait staff seems stretched and stressed. Sure hoping things get back to normal!"}
{"text":"Meatball Strombolli was huge, fresh and perfect crust, excellent ingredients and huge (did I say that?).  Eggplant and mushroom Strombolli lacked spice and real flavor but then again those ingredients typically do - so not a complaint, just an observation. Wonton nachos were tastey but I really loved the Lofah (?) with gorgonzola, mozzarella, bacon and sweet fig bits.  Will try the pizza on next trip.  Beers were good too.  Happy to return !"}
{"text":"Based on the nam eighties place I would expect Otto be bar style food. However, their menu is a little fancy compared to what I had expected. Their salads are very good and the service has always been great. There's not a lot of parking close to it but at least it's located in a shopping center. Wait times are sometimes very long and there aren't many seats for people who are waiting. There is also a massive bird problem if you happen to sit outside. Sometimes their specials are to die for and I really wish the buffalo chicken dip was an actual menu item. I did get food poisoning once from the buffalo chicken so I no longer order chicken from them."}
{"text":"I cannot give it 5 stars because the service isn't always amazing and the wait can be pretty long. But definitely 4 stars worthy because of the delicious garlic bread they start you off with. They have a decent wine and beer list. The salads are good, even better if you add chicken or salmon! I haven't had anything on the menu that wasn't worth trying. They do have some great Specials daily. The halibut cheeks are quite a fav! But I do wish they had more of a routine schedule because they have a great broccoli cheese soup (try it if its on that night). Enjoy your meal, just don't fill up on garlic bread!"}
{"text":"Nothing was bad for our visit, but nothing was great either. The bar has nowhere to stand if the seats are full, there were 4 beers on tap despite brew being in the name and the food was ok, but not great. I don't think the food was better than a Chilis. I would say for the price point that it was uninspired."}
{"text":"MY WHOLE FAMILY GOT FOOD POISONING!! We came here this past Sunday 4/15/18 around 3-4pm in the afternoon. We ordered a pizza for our family to split. This is the first we had eaten all day after spending the whole day at Goldfield. Hours later all of my kids starting throwing up. It lasted all night. We had to keep them home from school it was so bad. This is our first time coming here as we have heard good things- this is going to be our last time for sure. I'm disappointed in the quality and it saddens me that my kids had to eat this poor quality food. Disgusting. I will be making a call to the health inspector to check this place out."}
{"text":"Always good. Lots of food, plenty to share. Plan on a moderate wait."}
{"text":"I thought for sure I had reviewed RWB before as it's my wife and my \"go to\" spot when we want a great dinner near our house or want to pick up a quick bite to take home.   I have so many favorites here that's it hard to choose what I want :) Love the flat iron steak, the pizza is very good (and they have gluten free crust which my wife loves) and enjoy their fiesta chicken salad (that's not the exact name but the name slips my mind at the moment).   If you're up for dessert, try their chocolate cake - it's heaven!"}
{"text":"My wife and I came down to Az for spring training and came here twice. Once for dinner and once for lunch. We had great food and great service. They give you garlic bread which is fresh and warm when you sit down. The bartender, male, not sure of his name, was so attentive when we ate at the bar the first night. He knew the regulars and poured their drinks as soon as they sat down as well as made us feel welcome and gave us speedy and kind service. Will definitely come back to this place next year for spring training. The only downfall is that the patrons are typical wealthy white republicans, which was slightly uncomfortable for us being a young lesbian couple from Oakland, ca. The prices were very low by the way - great food and drink for the low price."}
{"text":"This is a quaint place for lunch. Love the seasonal lunch special(Dover sole flown in from the East coast this morning). The staff is friendly and attentive, prices are awesome for the portion size. Definitely would come here again."}
{"text":"Excellent food and stellar service. Great menu selection. It's a gem! Busy during snowbird season."}
{"text":"Excellent!! If you want great service and good food This is a nice Mesa gem of a place . Everything we Have ordered has been good! The staff is always spot on and nice !"}
{"text":"This place is WOW!! Awesome service,  delicious food, great prices! I ordered the Cajun blackened salmon- very delicious, not at all \"fishy\". The atmosphere is lovely... music not too loud, great decor, very friendly staff.  I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The name of this place is deceiving: it sounds like it's a dive bar, but their goal is to be a nice restaurant. I've been here for lunch and have enjoyed the majority of the dishes I've tried and the service has always been better than average. The place feels cramped no matter where you sit and it gets pretty noisy when it's full. Expect to pay a lot for lunch, but the portions are fairly large depending on what you order, so here's a tip: you can split a dish with someone and they'll bring it out on two plates for you. This makes it more reasonable and you still won't leave hungry."}
{"text":"RWB is always exceptional and tonight was no different. Exemplary service and delicious food. Great nightly specials all on display when you walk in. Always able to \"customize\" food and meet dietary requests without issue. Simply put, our go to place in Northeast Mesa."}
{"text":"Formidably Worthwhile?  If you really understand that there is no 'REAL' Italian big-box food to be found outside of New York or Chicago (probably even Italy itself), then you'll appreciate the fact that RW&B is somewhat decent for its moderate prices, family ambience, food value and respective adherence to the semblance of 'American' Italian food. Although everyone's taste is different, this stands above many within its reasonable price range. When visiting Phoenix and in the mood for above average run-of-the-mill Italian, we'll return to here!"}
{"text":"Wishing for the Halibut cheeks, but no luck. Dinner salad was huge but not very interesting, we will go for a baked potato or veggie next time.. Angle hair pasta with meatballs was very good. Think we will try a pizza next time since they look amazing. Love the service and personal attention of the waiters. This is on our Restaurants list to take visitors to. We think it will be on yours too. Already looking forward to returning for another food adventure."}
{"text":"Came here for the wings. Heard they were good. They were just \"okay\". BUT we found some awesome pizza. Brought me back to the city, great crust, perfect sauce/cheese ratio. I was surprised none of my peeps ever told me of this. One of my guests got the  Captains Broiled Platter. Everything was top notch except the fish, but we let that go, the shrimp was as big as a chihuahua, cooked well. Soup was delicious, obviously made fresh. The salad was great, no wilted stuff in there. They serve bread and salad with meals, a- friggin'- men. This may be my biggest pet peeve here in AZ. Seems the owner is East Coast and brought some restaurant etiquette and great food items with him. Beer selection good. We will be back, bringing more friends next time so we can try more items off the menu."}
{"text":"Ok I was skeptical about the expansive menu that spans from bar food to legit entrees.  This place delivers.  Our waitress was worth her weight in 24k gold.  Experienced, efficient and brought our dinners out super hot.  I'm so impressed with the quality, quantity of food and an owner/manager that greets customers that I give this place an great rating.  Work on your ceiling lighting (spots are s bit annoying) and it may be time to remodel to upgrade your ambiance."}
{"text":"Spent the early evening at a nearby lake.  Read the reviews and give this place a try.  Money well spent on all around good food and service.  The appetizer with the ravioli was tasty.  I had the steak and shrimp.  Steak was perfectly cooked and super good.  For dessert?  The bread pudding dish is the best in AZ.  No one comes close."}
{"text":"Obviously a popular restaurant that people love. There were people waiting for a table when we left. I agree with another reviewer, the name of the restaurant is misleading. Dirty and hungry after hiking, I was expecting a brewery type setting and menu. It's really a mid-range Italian restaurant. There were just a few sandwiches on the menu. None sounded very exciting. I had the marinated chicken sandwich which was bland chicken on a bland roll. The highlights were the free warm garlic rolls and sauteed spinach. Be careful, dining room floor has a weird, slippery,greasy feel."}
{"text":"The food is good but the customer service is the worst. I called ahead to let them know we'd have a party of 12 at lunchtime- well they don't take call ahead and won't put you on the list until everyone is present. So when we got there they said it would be an hour before they could accommodate us. They could have had a nice sized check with 12 people if they had just put tables together ahead of time. And to make it worse, the hostess is rude about it!! What a waste of a restaurant with good food!"}
{"text":"This restaurant caught our eye when we were in the plaza across the street. I saw it had a good rating on Yelp, so we decided to try it out one night when I had to work late and this type of food sounded really good.  My husband had the Gourmet Burger and I had the Marinated Grilled Chicken sandwich, with their bread pudding for dessert. (I'm a sucker for bread pudding. If I see it on the menu, I have to try it.)  The Gourmet Burger was a nice, simple burger with really yummy meat. I loved my sandwich particularly. It was served with a side of pesto mayonnaise that was absolutely delicious, and the chicken and mozzarella were so yummy.  The bread pudding was good - different than many places. It was dense, and I felt it could have used a little more flavor or more variety - it was a little hard to eat after awhile.  The service was very good and attentive. It was less expensive than I expected looking at the prices on the menu, but we did choose cheaper options.  Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Wow pretty much given up on finding a decent restaurant out this way and saw this place on yelp. Was not disappointed.  Crisp fresh salad, good drinks, giant portions and fair prices for a meal that turns into lunch and possibly dinner the next day."}
{"text":"I ordered the \"Signature Martini\" and it was the worse martini I've ever had. It tasted like cough syrup. We ordered the Buratta cheese appetizer. It was very bland and served with un-ripened tomatoes. I ordered the Pomodora for my main dish and it was also bland and stale tasting. The only positive from this night was the sangria drink substitution, the complimentary bread, outdoor atmosphere and friends. We will not be returning here."}
{"text":"Great place to come with your family and consistently good. Danny was our waiter and he couldn't of been more outstanding. Food is varied  Great seafood and wonderful wood pizza. Outstanding manager really listens to his customers and your satisfaction is important to him."}
{"text":"Enjoyed dinner on Thursday and it was nice to get a table immediately as it's usually a long wait.  The Jalapeño appetizer was a unique creation and pretty tasty. First time having a pizza with cauliflower crust and I do recommend it. Dylan was our exceptional server and he deserves acknowledgement!  The only thing that turned us off was watching a female waitress wipe up a spilled drink on the floor with a white towel then proceeded to wipe the chair and lastly wiped the table with the same towel.....WOW!!!  What kept us from being totally grossed out was the bus boy came with his own towel and wiped down the entire table. I guess this is why I never eat anything that falls onto the table as one never knows if or how they get cleaned!"}
{"text":"i ate here for lunch today, the food wasn't bad but the service could have been better, after my waitress disappeared after delivering food, i had to track down the cooks in the back just to get some ranch! however i did enjoy the food that's why i'm giving 3 stars."}
{"text":"Randomly ended up here after not being able to decide what to eat and just driving by it.  It looked busy so that's usually a good sign.  No available table's so we sat at the bar.  The bartender an lady in her mid 30s to early 40s was extremely nice.  My gf wanted a certain drink she had never heard.  She said she would go look it up, I offered her my phone and within a minute we googled the recipe and she had already made it.  We ordered food and were both very happy.  The chicken club damn near perfect enough said.  Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I have a strict \"no spending money in Mesa\" policy. (I avoid Mesa the same way I avoid nests of black widows, but that's a separate issue.) I admit that there are a FEW places in Mesa, and I mean a FEW, where I will spend my money. Red White and Brew is one of those few locations.   Mesa doesn't have many restaurants like this, especially not in north east Mesa. The floor plan is open, airy, well lit and feels roomy to me, even when the place is jam packed. I like the décor, it feels urban and modern. They bring to the table little buttery garlic bread things, which are good but filling. I have to have one and stop. I'm still impressed with their delicious barbeque chicken pizza and it's my default choice if I can't decide on anything else. I have tried a number of other dishes: pasta, steak, fish, salads and have enjoyed every one. The portion sizes are pretty damn enormous and I find it best to share with someone. The dessert menu is always a temptation as well.   They have a nice wine bar and I like their selection of draft beer. (In the winter, they sometimes carry Pumpkin Porter from Four Peaks. It's a seasonal favorite and if I wasn't so paranoid about calories, I'd drink it all the time.)  I've never had an unpleasant experience with the staff. They have always been friendly, helpful, and professional.   The last time I checked, they don't take reservations, which makes going with a group a bit difficult. Depending on the time of day and the day of the week, the wait to get in can take a while. I hate waiting (especially to eat at a place in Mesa!) but Red White and Brew is usually worth it."}
{"text":"Christmas Eve dinner - The food was magnificent and served on huge platters! We have eaten seafood all over this city and never had better, fresher seafood!!! We ate outside under the warmth of heaters on the patio. The wait staff was efficient, kept our glasses filled, but was not intrusive. I had their shrimp scampi with linguini. The shrimp were large and perfectly cooked, served over a generous portion of toothsome linguini. My cousin had muscles marina and hubby got the seafood al diavolo. There had to have been 15-20 huge muscles on Cousin's dish and hubby's plate was loaded with large shrimp, sea scallops, clams, and muscles. Our server arrived seconds later with a large bowl of fresh shaved Parmesan cheese to top off our pasta. Each entree came with a choice of sides. My side salad was a crisp variety of baby greens and the house's chunky blue cheese dressing was just tangy perfection. We will be back and have already started spreading the word to friends and family members about this gem in the far East Valley--well worth the drive, too."}
{"text":"Amazing food and staff. The variety in the menu always makes you coming back for more. Our favorite place to eat in the area. Everything is DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow, what a disappointment.   Pizza appeared to be their specialty and we went with a nice four topping pie and the $7 house salad to split.   The pizza was the equivalent of a bad frozen pie.   Horrible.  We ate one and a half of the 6 slices and could eat no more.   The waitress mentioned a new pizza cook that day but did not offer to comp this mess.   Oh, and the salad was the pour out of a $1 bag variety with a pile of shredded carrots on top.   Don't waste your time on pizza.   Could not comment on any other food at this place and never will as I won't be back."}
{"text":"Too bad there aren't minus stars. Asked for a table for 6. Policy is everyone has to be there to be seated, which is fine. Since we had no idea when #6 would arrive, we asked to be seated ... \"No. I don't have a big enough table yet, anyway, so you're just going to have to wait.\"  Wait, what? Really? I'm just going to have to sit and wait.... My son asked to speak to the manager who didn't care a fig that his staff was rude, but did point out that we didn't have an 'argument' because our party hadn't all arrived. There are several other reviews of the same tone, so I'm going to play armchair psychologist and hazard that they enjoy doing this to folks they don't know and we made their night!  If the last snippy snot remark hadn't been made we would have actually waited ... and been back."}
{"text":"This place has great soups and delicious halibut cheeks when in season. Also the portions are large and ingredients are fresh and flavorful. My favorite was the salmon appetizer with flat bread. Excellent!"}
{"text":"We ordered a bowl of the beef with barley soup.  The beef barley soup contained a surprising amount of beef, and the we very much enjoyed this.  We thought that the beef barely soup had great flavor and enjoyed the different vegetables contained within it.    For an entrée, we decided to split a entrée special which was a jumbo Canadian lobster tail.  The lobster tail was hot, well seasoned and presented nicely atop the tail shell.  The lobster tail mat was slightly sweet and firm, and won over both of us.  For the price charged, we felt  that this was an excellent value for the price.    The baked potato was split open and sides of sour cream topped with chives and butter pats were provided.  The vegetable of the evening was a mix of white and orange carrots and they tasted sweet, lightly seasoned and well cooked to a nice tenderness.  A side of butter in a tea light heater was provided to dip the lobster into.    After dinner we decided to split an apple dumpling for dessert.  The dumpling was served in a white bowl and presented nicely in its pastry pouch.  Caramel sauce was drizzled over the apple dumpling and vanilla ice cream was provided alongside.  We both enjoyed the apple dessert, and the  found the sweetness of the apple dumpling paired well with the cool vanilla ice cream."}
{"text":"I have typically liked the food from here when I've gotten pasta or pizza and the coconut shrimp and awesome. However, the last time we went here I ordered a steak and it was seriously under seasoned. It tasted like they did put any salt on it at all. For the price the food should always be on point in my opinion!"}
{"text":"I would probably give four stars except the wait time here is ridiculous and they won't take call ahead reservations. The food is good but not good enough to warrant the wait. That being said, I do love their garlic bread (complimentary) and their daily specials are innovative and provide options to those of living in Mesa (where good restaurants are hard to come by)."}
{"text":"I love it here!  I could say it's the best place in Mesa, which it is, but there's not a lot of competition, is there?  Haha.  But it is better than many restaurants in Chandler, Tempe & Scottsdale.  The food is better and the prices are lower. My favorite items are the New Zealand mussels and the sirloin steak.  I love that they have whole wheat pasta.   I have a lot of food allergies, and they always prepare my meal flawlessly. The bar is great too.  Sometimes I make up my own concoction and they are happy to prepare it.   The only downside is they don't take reservations.  If you come on a weekend during snowbird season, you'll wait 45-60 minutes.  Often the wait is shorter than the hostess predicts, so don't be discouraged."}
{"text":"Not a super well known place & its tucked away, but I love the pasta here. It's one of my favorites hands down!! The smoked mozzarella is unique. My kids love it too!! If you're in the area I recommend you make a stop in!!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice and been impressed with their food both times. I can't recall the name but we ordered a meat lovers pizza on both occasions along with a salad to share. The portions are very generous and the food is great, I would definitely go back again and I have recommended to many already."}
{"text":"Best bartender ever!! We came for lunch after shooting and not eating all day, we were both on the hangry side. The doors were not open yet, however there was huge crowd outside...why? Well, because this place is great! The service is stellar, the awesome bartender, sweet black lady was awesome. I hope no offense id\s taken to that, I just want to clarify that on this Sunday she had an immediate 30 orders fly to her and she handled it like a champ, she also made me the best Bloody Mary to date.  Our food was great! Not at all wishing or wondering what we could do to tweak was we were presented with. They also service this super 'diet friendly' (totally kidding) greasy amazing bread that is sooo good! The atmosphere is great, love the open kitchen and the service was above par, we will return after our next shooting adventure I am sure :)"}
{"text":"Living in NE Mesa, there are not a lot of good independent restaurants.  (Especially having been in Chicago).  This place in an exception.  Great food and a quality atmosphere.   While I enjoy all their food, the choice of local draft beers make it all the better."}
{"text":"This place is the Bomb!   Try the Eggplant Florentine, it's 16 bucks but seriously can serve 4 people easily!!!!!! You need to split it.  All dishes are huge, including the kids meals. Have your kid order a pizza slice on the kids menu and you will see what I mean!!!  Love this place but it's alwaysssss busy.  No wonder right?"}
{"text":"RWB is our solid go-to. Here in the East valley we're deprived of good food options, but we are never disappointed with a visit to the brew. They've always got a fresh special if you want to try something more seasonal, and they do their staples consistently well. If you leave hungry, it's your own fault. My favorite is the Chicken Marsala, big enough to feed at least two if you order it over linguini, it always ends up my lunch for the next day. We also recommend ordering a side of marinara to dip the garlic bread in and we have never been disappointed by a soup du jour!"}
{"text":"If I could give 4.5 I would.  Bumped up to five partially because there are very few restaurants like this in mesa.  By that I mean local,  non chain, nice decor.  Basically it has a Scottsdale feel in east mesa.  I usually get the calzone, it's enough for two to split and get full.  Don't get me started on the bread. .. the poor waiter always has to bring me a couple refills.  Pricy,  but not overpriced.  A good place to celebrate."}
{"text":"My wife and I eat out a lot and she chose this place tonight. It has a ton of reviews on Yelp and Google so it worked for me. When we got there they said an hour wait, which normally means I turn around and find somewhere else. But I couldn't talk the wife out of it this time. So, we finally got our table and by this time I'll eat anything. The wait staff was attentive and had good timing. They have a large selection of beers and wines as indicated by the name. I ordered Boneless Ribyeye steak and she ordered the seafood sample plate. I was very impressed with the quality of a steak especially since this place seems to be pizza and beer at first glance. I also tried my wife's shrimp and scallops and they are also top notch. I am very pleased with the quality and the experience in general."}
{"text":"No wifi??? Only 2 TVs at bar. Smoked salmon salad $12 was very good."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service, excellent drink selection- I adore this place. My parents have a taste for great food and they have never been wrong - I can add this to the list! I've actually never met anyone personally who doesn't love the Brew. Start out with the Asparagus fries, you'll be glad you did. Save room for dessert, too! On a side note, I was there with my Dad and sister one night and all our food arrived at the same time- I felt like we were descended upon on by the staff, anticipating and attending to the smallest detail, and then they were gone to leave us to enjoy our meal. It made me feel like a million bucks!"}
{"text":"Just read bad reviews, (especially managment responses). Same happend with us. Guess they just don't care. Let them know they need to change. Maybe someone can reach the owner."}
{"text":"Excellent, a neighborhood jewel with perhaps the best steak in Mesa!  I love eating here for the variety, daily specials and consistently good food and service.  The hot bread that comes with the meal is scrumptious, salads are served fresh to order with delicious dressings and the menu offers a nice variety.  Red, White & Brew is proof that you can't improve on perfection!"}
{"text":"Tried calling for reservations yesterday for our group of 7 for lunch. No reservations taken and no call ahead on the day. So I got there at 11:20 today with the others to arrive at 11:30. I said we'd need a table for 7. They refuse to seat parties over 4 unless all are there. OK. Soon afterwards 2 more of our group arrived and then another one. So now we are 5. They would have to put 2 four-tops together for 5 or for 7, so we asked to be seated so we could order drinks and one would order the meal as she had to leave earlier. Nope, they refused. I asked the for manager and tried to point out that we would need the same sized table so why not seat us now because the very small waiting area was full of us old people with bad hips, standing in the uncomfortable SMALL area near the door, waiting for the rest of their groups to arrive. There is seating for at most 6 people in the waiting area.  He said we could go to the bar and eat there, open seating. We DO NOT WANT to eat in the bar. He would not budge so we left. My parting shot was to ask him when he thought I'd be back--the answer is NEVER. The other partial groups were complaining too but did not think to leave I guess. Well the moronic manager actually did us a favor--we went across the street to Pacino's and had a great lunch with reasonable prices.  From now on we will bypass RWB and go directly to Pacino's when we eat in Mesa. And my husband and I will not go to RWB again--we live in Mesa but we will go farther to chose a restaurant that is properly run. How ridiculous to act as they did. I can see not giving away a table for 8 if only one person is there in case some others don't show up. But to not have one grain of common sense is crazy.  When we left there were not that many tables left so I suspect that by the time the last 2 in our group arrived (and I had explained they are coming from farther away and were on their way) there likely would be no tables available and then there would be a wait for a table to open. Pacino's was calm and quiet and cool. A nice respite from the noise at RWB. Someone should tell RWB that their open kitchen thing is no longer the latest thing--very noisy. But they can do what they want as far as I'm concerned since I won't ever go there again."}
{"text":"I had high hopes based on the reviews but I was highly disappointed. The food was subpar at best and not that inexpensive."}
{"text":"This  place is always busy, and many people I know consider it the best restaurant in NE Mesa. The service, and ambience is excellent.   However, the food is where I change my opinion. My husband and I have been there 3 times, 1st time pizza, second time lunch, and 3rd dinner. And, we have found the menu items sounded really good but the food was bland.I believe we are in the minority though. Everything tastes okay, just nothing really stood out as delicious."}
{"text":"I love this place; they easily have the best food in a short radius to my house. Here is Red White & Brew in a nutshell: excellent food, quick and friendly service, extensive drink pairings, and consistent quality.  RW&B is probably the best restaurant in East Mesa. They are as good as most any fine dining restaurant, but it has the price tag of an Outback or a Cheesecake Factory. While they have great pizza, steaks, pasta, burgers, chicken, and weekly/seasonal specials, the big surprise is their fish. Fresh, quality seafood is hard to find in AZ, and is almost nonexistent outside of big chains that can fly theirs in cheap. Thankfully, RW&B is close to home and is decently affordable. For the money, this is the best food in eastern Mesa."}
{"text":"One of our favorite non-chain restaurants. Awesome food! We have never had anything we didn't like. The eggplant parm is amazing!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The pizza was fantastic and could feed an army and the calamari was perfectly crispy and flavorful. The service was so-so in the dining room but the bartender was really super cool. We stuck around the bar for a couple hours to watch the game and talk with her and the many regulars that hang out around the bar area. The manager was one of the most on the ball and helpful managers I have ever witnessed within an establishment.   I would highly recommend this place for anyone in the area as it is in East mesa."}
{"text":"RWB is a staple of my diet now. Their normal menu is great but they never cease to impress with their specials. If you want a casual place to get five star meal this is the spot."}
{"text":"The food and service were amazing. Definitely on my regular rotation now! Their RWB chicken was fantastic."}
{"text":"My life partner/husband and I went to eat lunch/dinner today at Red White &Brew McDowell.  We arrived at 2:30 on Friday, and were seated right away. Great waitress and amazing food.  We ordered the Mediterranean salad and Chicago pizza.  The salad was crisp, fresh and served chilled. The pizza was hot, crunchy and delicious.    You can't go wrong eating here!!! We ordered the large pizza so we ended up taking most of it home."}
{"text":"Overall the food is consistently good, unfortunately the inside is terribly loud. It makes it difficult to have a conversation."}
{"text":"Always delicious!! Started off with the garlic knots and marinara!! So yummy:) Kids got the chicken tenders and fries that come with a drink. Good size for bigger kids too. I got the sausage sandwich which was ginormous!! We also got the grilled chicken club which was very good, not as big as the sausage sandwich. The sides were sooo good which was the ceasar salad and garlic sauted spinach!! So yummy"}
{"text":"This is our 2nd time here and the first time was great! Our waiter, Justin, was very friendly and helpful. Had the Italian sausage hoagie and wings before so are back to try the pizza!"}
{"text":"Best place to eat in NE mesa.  Great Staff and Service.  Any Daily special on the menu is always great and in very large portions.  Have been going here for years and is always a great experience.  Pizza is also the best in the area and worth the extra few dollars."}
{"text":"We went for lunch based on a recommendation and were not disappointed! Huge menu and many daily specials. Our server was very helpful and gave recommendations. The only thing that was slightly hard was they would not seat us until our entire party was there  (we were missing one) and we ended up having to wait for a table once she arrived."}
{"text":"came here because the rv park owner told us it was THE BEST Perhaps our problem was we came for lunch. Very disappointing in the quality and flavor of the food."}
{"text":"I live in Texas and winter in Mesa at my daughter's. I travel the country for a living as an antique dealer and by and far this is my favorite restaurant in the country! I look forward to my winter stay and visits to RWB. We even had my daughter's wedding catered by them and it was fabulous. Food is always fantastic and innovative, service is fabulous too. Kudos!"}
{"text":"My father-in-law lives in Mesa, and we go to RWB every time we visit.  Everything on the menu is great.  My wife particularly loves the creme brulee."}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal here! I've been coming to Red White and Brew since it opened, and my family and I keep coming back! Out of all the years it's been opened, I've tried so many things on their menu and I have nevvvver been disappointed. They have garlic bread that they give every table and it's and it's so delicious. I always get asparagus fries (the dipping sauce that it comes with is amazingggg, i always keep it when I get the veggie burger) and muscles. Both are always delightful! (Dipping the garlic bread into the muscle sauce is a necessity!)  I have tried so many items but I love the shrimp RWB, the black bean burger and the coconut shrimp (the shrimp are hugggge!!) are my go to's! Sometimes on the specials menu they have grilled plantains and I always get them if they serve it, so sweet and has a little crunch!   This restaurant has so many memories for my family and I. We will always come here for all occasions or just to have a nice lunch/ dinner. Amazing and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"This was my first meal in AZ, after I flew in to meet my new boss. It's very good Italian, especially the garlic bread. I like the beer selection too, an important part of the menu as their name indicates. I wish the prices were a little lower because it's near my job so I am more likely to go for lunch, but the food I've had to date has always been good. Their NY style pizza is good, and they have nice desserts too."}
{"text":"Second time there both times on vacation about a yr apart . Staff is very friendly! Food is fantastic and good size portions ! Highly recommend !"}
{"text":"This is one of the best restaurants in Mesa. We have come here for years. They have a menu that everyone can find something they like. The staff is always wonderful. We always try to sit in Michael's section whenever he is there. He is always amazing at taking care of us. There is always a wait, but good things will come to those who wait. Once you sit down though, it never takes long to get your food. The portions are large so be prepared to take some home. I always have to get dessert to go. Everything I've tried on the menu is great. Whenever we have guests in town, this is where we take them."}
{"text":"This is a place worth driving to. The gang and I spent an enjoyable Friday night dining at Red, White and Brew. The food was wonderful and the portions so large that we all left with \"doggie bags\". I had the Eggplant Parmesan with homemade marinara. The eggplant was tender and the marinara tasty. This was piled on a heap of pasta and covered with mozzarella cheese. I would say that the pasta wasn't necessary, however. Others had steak, shrimp, and pizza. I highly recommend this place, but you should split the entree."}
{"text":"Four of us came here the other day, and  had an overall good experience. The bread they serve is really good. My friend got the cream of mushroom soup, which I did not try, but she was absolutely in love with it. I enjoyed my French Onion soup very much. For my meal, I got the spinach empanada special, which I thought were terrible, but our server was great and when she noticed I barely ate them, said she would give the feedback to management and didn't charge us. I also tried the chicken parm pasta dish, and that was pretty good. Really appreciate the customer-centriv service!"}
{"text":"Fantastic.  Every single time I go!  (1 time a month).  So darn good.  Nice job all around."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!! I stumbled onto it and now frequent often. Pamela, the bartender, is amazing !! I ate the best Antipasto salad of my life and quite frankly I have loved everything I have gotten here.  Thank you RWB for giving us a great place to gather, having awesome folks like Pamela there and serving some awesome food !!!!"}
{"text":"We had a great date night here. Attentive and humorous bartender, sangria and a blonde lager (Rodeo something) while we waited for our table. Yummy garlic bread served warm. Had table on patio. One and only negative is when cars pulled in and out of spots over half wall from our table the headlights could be bright. But even then had one gentleman apologize in advance when they went to leave. Jen was awesome server. Knowledgeable with a great sense of humor. Had the cod special with a scrummy almond crust and delish lemon honey butter glaze. Super good. House salad served chilled. Big bonus in my books. Bf had steak and mashed potatoes. Generous portions. Good pour of Merlot for price. Excellent all the way around. Will be back."}
{"text":"It's been a while since we've been here... They no longer have the onion rings on the menu? What is the world coming to??"}
{"text":"Oh Red White and Brew...what has happened to you?  I have been coming to RWB for a few years now but the last couple of times I have dined here I have noticed their service has really started to slip.  Their menu has changed slightly over the last couple of years and they took the crab cakes off the menu and they were my favorite thing to order.  However, their menu does offer something for everyone and the quality of their food is very good.  However, their service has gotten so slow and inattentive.  I think they have possibly had a turnover in their staff.  I would really hate to see this restaurant close due to their service issues.  They need to take time to have new servers shadow veteran servers before starting alone on the floor.  I would recommend giving RWB a try because you will get a tasty meal.  On most Friday and Saturday nights they also offer great live music in the bar too."}
{"text":"Saturday night dinner special was Bairdi Snow Crab Leg Clusters a 18 ounce serving.  This is by far the sweetest crab I have had in a ling time.  Check out the dinner specials on line.  If you never dined here you will never be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food ...awesome selections. If you can't find something you like on the menu... then you are not hungry! Our server was an older gentleman ( wish I could remember his name ) was so engaging and funny. He said he had been there for more then 5 years, really knew his stuff. The tomato soup they had that night we were there was out of this world."}
{"text":"Went Christmas Eve.  A bit of a wait so we ate on the patio next to the heater.  Service was good.  Specials were terrific.  Deserts were great.   I've had their pizzas before.  Never been disappointed with the food or the service, even though it is always busy."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my top 3 favorite restaurants. The food is EXCELLENT, big selection from American to Italian to good seafood (for Arizona at least). The portions are large, get a TOGO box and have a full meal the next day. I've eaten here at least a half a dozen times, never had a bad experience. Cost is VERY reasonable. I have nothing bad to say about this place, no complaints.   Park in the subway lot and walk over, lot gets congested with cars and pedestrians."}
{"text":"Their lunch and dinner specials are always different! I have never had a bad meal here! The waitstaff must have changed because everyone is smiling and happy. Best pizza around. And if you like chicken get the RWB."}
{"text":"Had dinner here Wednesday night, sat in the dining room area. Paul was my server, I've never had such an enjoyable experience at a restaurant in my life. He was smart and funny, really made our night. I loved the wine he recommended. Honestly this server deserves a raise, maybe promotion. Will be back for sure just to see Paul again. And dinner was yummy too."}
{"text":"I have yet to eat here,  but next time I am out that way I will be sure to give their pizza a go.  The girl next to me was sure enjoying hers.  Their beer selection is excellent and the atmosphere and decorations inside would make it a great place for date night."}
{"text":"I have been here twice.  Sat outside twice and had walleye twice.  Hmmmm, I guess I am not to adventurous.  The first time I went the walleye was fabulous.  The second time it was a little crispy but still tasted good.  I like the outside because you can actually have a conversation without fighting the bar noise. This is a very casual restaurant.  It has a very large menu which I think is a negative.   Can they really cook all of those different entree with high quality?  By the way the hot garlic bread sticks are outstanding and I sampled the pizza which was pretty good also.  I will come again."}
{"text":"We always had good experience here, if something goes wrong they take care of it swiftly. Very friendly, quick, attentive service and yummy food. Lunch specials are must with $10-13 range including soup or salad and yummy house made bread sticks."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food and service. Just wish they would accept reservation because it gets to the point it's not even worth trying to go there."}
{"text":"We have been going to RWB for more than 10 years. We're not there every week, or even every month, but it is somewhere that we are always comfortable taking out of town visitors. Frankly, I am surprised I haven't ever written a review of this place.  I am not much into sitting art a bar and watching sports, but it has always looked to me like people who enjoy that sort of thing really like this place. For me, it is mostly about the food, but also about the service and atmosphere.  Expect large portions -- usually enough to share. For your first time, or if you are with younger kids, you might try one of the pizzas or pizza rolls. I really like both of those options, although my wife says they are just OK. My kids order the pizza slices off of the kids menu 99% of the time, so they're with me on this one. In my opinion, the hamburgers, sandwiches and desserts are fine, but the entrees really are the stars of the show.  Keeping that in mind, you can order off the regular menu, but I highly recommend at least taking a look at the daily specials. There is usually something for everyone on that list, and each one is a combination of high quality ingredients with an interesting preparation and/or sauce. I can't remember ever being disappointed with a selection from this menu.  Of particular note are the Halibut Cheeks. If you have never had these, you really should give them a try. The cheeks are a little like lobster from a firmness perspective (at least, that's how they were described to me) and do not have a mild taste. How can you go wrong when a dish is served with drawn butter?? With an order, you get a baked potato and a side (salad, soup, veggie, or fries). Unless you're REALLY hungry, get an order and split it. This is a seasonal thing and usually the supply is limited, so you have to hit it on the right night if you want to order them. I think they're flown in fresh from Boston. My wife watches the RWB website for these to show up on the menu and they usually trigger an immediate \"RWB night.\"  From a service perspective, our servers have always been very attentive and the front desk staff have been friendly and welcoming: they say hello when you show up and usually hold the door and thank you for coming in when you leave. Be aware that the place gets VERY crowded during peak times, so you may have to wait a long time or come back another night.  Just do it!"}
{"text":"This is one of those restaurants where everyone that goes there and works there have been doing so for years. It's like the \"Go to.\" place to eat if you live in NE Mesa.  They care about quality and making sure everything is done right. If you make the slightest comment about what you get not being what you expected they will want to fix it or get you something else. Customer service is a major MAJOR priority there.  The owner seems to be both creative and OCD at the same time. Daily specials are really, truly specials. It isn't like they take an item and put it on sale. They actually will buy some higher end element of a meal and build a special around it. So, the specials are really special.  The place seemed pricey when I first went there but the quality of food and service completely justifies the price. I would go here for any special occasion and I would recommend my son takes his homecoming or prom date there."}
{"text":"Whenever we have out of town guests...we visit RWB.  Everyone is always impressed and always LOVE whatever they order.  Be sure to check out the specials - there are some yummy, yummy things listed there!  The portions are HUGE!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of the best I have EVER been to!!! The bread is amazing. So is the food. I had the angel hair pasta with Alfredo sauce. IT WAS THE BEST THANG EVA!!!!! GURL, EVERY ONE SHOULD GO HERE! *-*  And my boring parents shared a Caesar salad and the chicken over linguine with mushrooms, capers, and artichokes.  They raved about it."}
{"text":"I work up the street from RWB and get their soup for lunch 2-3 times a week via the to-go counter. The girls that help me couldn't be nicer and the soup & breadsticks are to die for.  For the first time last night, my husband and I went into the restaurant to have dinner. It was the best dinner I have EVER had. I had the halibut cheeks with asiago scalloped potatoes with a bowl of cream of mushroom soup. I have had the soup before, and it is one of my favorites. It is nothing like the stuff you get in the can. It is full of very large sliced mushrooms and is soooo yummy. The halibut cheeks were amazing. They taste quite a bit like crab, but with none of the work of trying to pry the meat from the shell, and they are served with hot butter. My husband had the boneless spare ribs, and they were also wonderful. The breadsticks you get with your meal are also wonderful. We will definitely be back for dinner again soon."}
{"text":"I ordered a takeout pizza in January of 2016.  1st time there and it was a Friday around 730pm.  It was a madhouse but surprisingly I got my order in at a separate to go stand and got my pizza in about 15mins.  The staff was super nice and very efficient for being tht busy and the pizza was great.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Just went for the 2nd time. We had visited here back in 2016 and remembered enjoying it so we figured let's go back! All 6 of us enjoyed our food. I got the ribeye, it was good for the price! Not top quality steakhouse but it was still tasty. The portions on every dish was very generous! Would recommend if in the area."}
{"text":"Marginal at best. Food was ok at best. Service was ok at best. I will say the peach cobbler was pretty good."}
{"text":"Red White and Brew is a family favorite! We've been coming here for over 10 years and it's always been great.   Tonight was no exception! Right as my husband and I sat down, hot bread was immediately brought to our table along with ice waters! Our waitress was very helpful with the menu and even brought us a sample of the soup of the day!!  I ordered the bourbon salmon and my husband ordered the bone in pork chop. My meal was incredible! I loved everything! He enjoyed his as well, but wasn't quite blown away.   Overall, our experience was top notch. We will keep coming back year after year!"}
{"text":"I didn't like this place much. After reading all the excellent reviews I decided to go there with my hubby to celebrate my graduation and was disappointed.  I ordered the seafood platter over linguine and my hubby got some chicken with artichoke over linguine platter. The seafood on my platter was mediocre and the linguine was swimming in a oily puddle of bland tasting sauce.  It tasted like plain vegetable oil poured all over the noodles and for $20 I was regretting this choice. My husband's was also alright, his sauce was a bit oily also, but it had a little more flavor than mine. The portions are ridiculously huge also...and I mead ridiculous. It would be very wise to split an entree with someone if you go, but I don't recommend this place and will not return."}
{"text":"I think this is the best restaurant I've been to since I moved here.  You walk in and it smells as if you are bathing in garlic.  They bring out a warm, buttery garlic bread that is delicious, save some for the meal.  One of the best French onion soups I've had.  The salad was also awesome.  Very fresh and flavorful.  Portions are very generous.  Great selection of brew.  Will definitely have to go back!"}
{"text":"I don't understand the line to get into this place.  The food is mediocre at best.  The prices are a bit high for what they are.  However the portions are huge.    The wait staff was great and my Margarita was excellent.  I may make it back to the bar but I will skip the restaurant."}
{"text":"Was really pleased with my meal and the excellent service.  Waitress explained menu very well and gave some suggestions. Will definitely be back again with my friends!"}
{"text":"Love this place dearly, have been here a half dozen times and food, service, prices, and personalities of the staff and management have been great. Just want to let management know that I took partner for a birthday meal today (Sunday). His ribeye was really good but I got Ipswich fried clams and they really were not good, and I was born 50 miles from Ipswich and know of full bely clams my clams.  There was one belly in the lot and they were extremely dried out and tasteless. So  managers, please check into this. Thank you and it's something I wanted to point out to you and we will always go back."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood watering hole that serves great food at a solid price!!  Friendly staff and consistent quality have made us regulars at the Brew.  Their pizza is really good, can't go wrong ordering any of the speciality pizzas!!  Their complimentary bread is so so delicious, ask your server for a side of warm marinara to take those breadsticks to the next level!!!"}
{"text":"I have to say, the first couple times I went there. It was about a 45 minute wait and I do not like waiting in line to eat. So that always throws me off of a lot of places, but I have to say after the 3rd time we finally got in within minutes. The food was pretty good and the prices were reasonable. Eventhough I don't like lines it was well worth it to finally get in there. Remember it is out in East Mesa and a lot of snowbirds go there and they are on there way if not already here."}
{"text":"The food is normally hot, tasty, and filling.  Their green bean fries and bread are amazing.  Seems like a wide range of beer.  I remember once they had blueberry beer.  For some reason, this place doesn't stand out to me too much.  I only go when someone else suggests it, but I normally don't regret it."}
{"text":"Great place. I have been here at least 20 times and no complaints other then sometimes have to wait 20 minutes. But that's going to happen when it's great service and great food. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Very nice family restaurant! Food for everyone and very accommodating! I've had the gluten free pizza and the Beyond Beef burger both of which are really good. My girlfriend gets the Gluten Free Chicken and Spinach Raviolis. I dont know about you guys but where can you go out and get that?? They have a full bar. They also do not take reservations and will sit you only when everyone in your party has arrived."}
{"text":"Our favorite place to eat in Mesa in the winter...yes we are snowbirds.  I have eaten the same thing forever, Shrimp Monaco, but tonight got the seared scallops.  Usually you are lucky if you get four....there were about about 7 or 8.  Delicious.  Hubby loves the bourbon pecan salmon....he cleans his plate.  We have never had a waiter or waitress that is not professional and very knowledgeable about the menu.  Michael was our first waiter and it is good to see him still there....great waiter.  Love to sit and watch the workers take care of the patrons, just all done so well.  And we live watching the kitchen staff, how they manage to get the meals all ready for one table at once is amazing.  And the best part, the person that brings the meals to the table knows where each meal goes.  We highly recommend this place to everyone we meet and our friends we have taken there love it too.  See you in October RWB!"}
{"text":"Great staff. Had me comfortable and laughing all night. Not one bad thing on the menu. From pizza and wings To steak and mussels. Everything was top notch"}
{"text":"My wife and I joined our friends for dinner on a Friday night.  We arrive just before 5pm.  We sat outside on the patio.  Our timing was perfect as it immediately began to crowd up.  As usual we were greeted almost immediately and received our drinks and hot bread in short order.  Our friends ordered surf and turf which they split, I ordered the penne with vegetables, my wife ordered steak with garlic mash potatoes.  Everyone enjoyed their meal and service.  I unfortunately forgot how huge the portions were and came home with lunch for the next day.   We have never been disappointed with this restaurant and would highly recommend a visit."}
{"text":"If this place were closer to where I lived I would be a regular for sure ( I'm in South PHX) I met a friend for lunch and was impressed from the minute the door was opened for me and I was greeted to the moment I got my ginormous, tasty steak salad and wine. My friend got the trout lunch special and it was top notch presentation and quality - especially for the price. The menu is fairly extensive with everything from salads, flatbreads, sandwiches, steaks and fish. The service was extremely attentive too. All around a great experience - just wish I lived closer."}
{"text":"Nothing short of outstanding. Great service. Great food. Great ambiance. It'd be a crime not to try their succulent shrimp bisque, their stuffed portabella, their coconut shrimp, and their porterhouse! I flew in from Miami just to come back to this place. Been coming here for 14 years from whenever in the world I could be."}
{"text":"Service is excellent. We are regulars and enjoy the garlic bread and special dishes of the night. The drink selection is fair. It's not a great place to watch sports it's a better place to get to know people and socialize."}
{"text":"I had RWB cater my wedding. The food was EXCELLENT. Every guest had something positive to say. The food was delivered on time, and the price was very reasonable. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"One of the best local restaurants in Mesa!  Food is always delicious.  Service is always wonderful, even the waitress in training was great!  Very friendly and great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Very impressed with this place. The name makes it sound like a sports bar or a brewery. But it's casual-Fine dinning. And I am so surprised it's been over looked or not given as much credit as it deserves. We had coconut shrimp to start and these were the biggest shrimp I have ever seen!  And the sauce was a jalapeño pineapple aoli or tartar. It wasn't what I was expecting but it was to die for.  We then decided to get steak (and 14 oz New York and a sirloin) both cooked just right and both being a great cut and quality.  So glad we went here instead of an overpriced steakhouse bc it was lovely. Great service. Nice ambiance for a tues night.  Oh and the complimentary breadsticks were on point. Could use a dipping sauce of sorts but I'm sure they would be more then accommodating if we asked. Def be back to try more menu items."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Love the coconut shrimp and free garlic breadsticks. But the prices are a little steep"}
{"text":"The unlimited bread they give you with your meal is DELICIOUS. My boyfriend and I shared the Mediterranean pizza here. It was so garlic-y (in a good way) and yummy. I would definitely order it again. The service was good. There was a wait but it's been like that every time I've been here and I take it as a good sign :)"}
{"text":"Had a small wait, but that tells us something about the restaurant.  Food, service and atmosphere was 5 Star.  we will definitely become loyal customers."}
{"text":"ENormous portions. Food was just ok, service just ok. Most of the menu is pretty unhealthy. I know, I know- what did I expect from a bar style restaurant? Well, their menu, on the surface, doesn't appear like bar food quality. But it is. After two visits, we won't be going back. There are just too many other yummy options around."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Got seated immediately. Many Gluten free options, pasta, salad dressing, cake and more. Wait staff was friendly and competent. Wide variety on menu!"}
{"text":"We have been to Red White and Brew numerous times and have never been disappointed. They have a wide variety of entrees to choose from with everything ranging from succulent steaks to savory pizza and pasta dishes. The coconut shrimp is very good and the portions will definitely leave you full (although it's tempting, don't eat too many of the breadsticks). Don't miss out on the dessert options either!  The creme brûlée is spot on. The only downside is it can be a bit busy on weekends but it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, delicious food and doesn't break the bank. The menu has an option for everyone and everything and sounds so good I couldn't make up my mind, our entire party was blown away and pleased. I can't wait to try all of them! (I LOVE all the creative and unique vegetarian options THANK YOU!) top notch care from our server, super nice and friendly, excellent atmosphere and lovely patio seating. Don't even get me started on the dessert menu, just do it"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood spot. Really good service and food. If ever I've had a problem with a dish, they take care of it. No questions. Oh, and they have really good selection of regional micro and craft brews."}
{"text":"Red White & Brew...oh, how un-Mesa of you to exist...  Sometimes I call RW&B the only real restaurant in Mesa, but that's usually when I'm being a bit snarky over the fact that it feels like (or in most cases, not only \"feels like\" but is completely true) every single thing out there is closed down by 8pm.  There's also a big lack of non-chain-non-crappy dive-restaurants in Mesa.  Red White & Brew fits the bill for a spot to grab dinner with my parents when I visit them.  This is usually how the RW&B experience plays out: My mother and I go to dinner.  I get an iced tea, she gets a diet coke.  We devour the yummy garlic-y buttery rolls (note: extremely uncharacteristic of my mother to \"devour\" anything, let alone something described as \"buttery\"...I told you, this place is magic).  I order the French Onion soup (SO DELICIOUS, my favorite place to get French Onion Soup).  I also order the coconut shrimp with mashed potatoes and steamed veggies.  My mother eats the shrimp (so big, so good, so juicy--totally makes me miss seafood) and  I eat the sides.  We commence with deep conversation over various topics: Sex, Politics, My Sister, Our Family...my mother and I are very close, but especially over dinners here do we have some great conversation.  We take the leftovers home to my dad or sometimes order to-go for him and my sister.  The experience of course varies depending on who I'm with, but the experience is definitely always good.  I always leave extremely full...even if I just eat a little bit (I think it's because I always drink so much tea).    PS Wide Beer and Wine selections along with the full bar.  Seasonal imports from far away places (like Nicaragua) and AZ Microbrew favorites of my father's.  PPS Now there's a second location in very South Chandler."}
{"text":"Went for the first time tonight and absolutely loved it. It helped that our waitress Jeannine was fantastic.  She could tell I really wanted to try the chowder but just didn't want a full bowl.  Next time she came to our table she had two samples for me.   Drinks were good, service was just right (there when we needed, but not annoying).  Food was fantastic.  There were also little things, like how my wife and father in law split a dish and it came out already split on two plates,  or how our server packaged up the leftovers for us. Just that extra touch of class. We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I love this joint so much! I come in a lot and rarely order from the menu as they always have amazing specials! Great drinks too!"}
{"text":"We have been there on 2 occasions.  Both times we had very slow service even though there was hardly anyone in there.  The food was good.  I had the fish and chips the first time.  They only have them on special days.  I felt like fish and chips again so my son looked up the menu on the Internet, called and yes it was the special of the day.  Went in at 3:00 p.m. where they seated us and took our drink order.  The waitress didn't come back!  She was busy chatting to other customers.  Finally she came back over to us as she noticed that my husband's drink was empty.  Then she asked what we would like to order and we all said fish and chips.  She said there were out of them and also out of one of the other specials of the day.  Then she tried to serve us the wrong order.  Slow, slow, slow.  Next time we are going to order carry out."}
{"text":"I always get amazing food here. Never fails, the wait is usually kinda long maybe like 45 min. but its a good thing because thats how popular they are in our are. Their service is amazing and so are the breadsticks. We actually had them cater our wedding. They are the best in the area."}
{"text":"Very good food and service.  Large portions served.  Rhonda was our server, very attentive, kind, and fun to interact with.  I certainly recommend this establishment to anyone wanting an excellent meal and cold adult beverage."}
{"text":"I didn't write a review the first time I was here. The review I wrote was for the 2nd time. The first time, I was with a friend and we had a wonderful time. I was excited to go back."}
{"text":"A good indication of a great experience is wanting a repeat ASAP. My husband and I came here for dinner after a long drive from So Cal to our new home in Mountain Bridge. We were immediately impressed with the attentive staff and blown away with the portions of delicious food. (I had such a plentiful plate, we split my leftover pasta for lunch the next day!) A few days later, we went back for happy hour and were just as impressed. Dan at the bar was pleased to share recommendations on local brews - just what we were after, being fresh  Arizona residents! Food is delivered from the kitchen piping hot... wonderful. This place is run like a tight ship. We had a quick chat with the manager, Demi, who stopped by to see how dinner was going. She was really cool and obviously very involved in ensuring guests enjoy every aspect of their meal, which we did. We've lived here just over a week and have already found our new local! Awesome."}
{"text":"Loved, loved, loved this place! The service was top notch, (I believe our waiters name is Mike), the menu was diverse and super tasty. We wanted to try more than we were hungry for! The cocktails were done just right too. As soon as I'm back in the area we will be returning."}
{"text":"Very good food, nice atmosphere, efficient wait staff.  My only complaint would be that there is always a wait for a table. Get there early people!"}
{"text":"Plenty of food, great specials and they have a frequent visitor card you can earn points and use toward your future visits.  Food has always been great and service friendly.  You won't be hungry when you leave this restaurant!  They also offer take out and the pizza's are great!"}
{"text":"This is an East Mesa secret - a great restaurant with great service. I hate leaving a review this good because I'll have to wait for a table - but they are worth the wait."}
{"text":"We just start having dinner in R, W and B restaurant and have change a lot for better, the food and service is much better, very bussy but is word and the best in the area. We are going back there again and again."}
{"text":"Canolis are the reason this is getting a 5 star review.  I have enjoyed their pizza, but the fact they get their canoli filling from the East Coast made my wife extremely happy. She has been looking for someone to do them right and getting them from the source is what made her happy.  The staff is extremely nice and when we came in with our 10 month old, they were helpful in every way to make sure he was happy and if they needed any help."}
{"text":"Hands down, best steak in town!  Okay, so it is high time I finally review this place. I go here with my sister maybe... once every two months? Sometimes more frequently. We love it here. Originally, I was referred to this place by a very cheery funny and friendly Walmart Cashier on a shopping trip where my mother, for no real reason, had gotten noticeably stressed out. She suggested the place for a drink to calm her down - I didn't point out that we don't drink, but I filed the name away in my mind for future reference. It was possibly two years after that that I actually went here, and immediately loved it.  Alright, so lets start with some slight flaws. Every place has them, and RWB is no exception. Mainly, the place is so popular, parking can be difficult at times, and the waiting area is lacking. So, if you go here on a busy night, you might be standing outside for a bit - BUT even with this, the food is worth it.   Every time I come here, the staff is wonderful and the food is amazing... but, I confess... I usually get the same thing every time. Medium marinated 10 oz. flat Iron steak with potatoes and a salad.   Best. Thing. Ever.   My first few times here, I tried a few other things, but after giving the steak a try... I can't pass it up. And, let me say, I hate steak. I never eat it anywhere else because I hate chewing on boot-leather, and have never been pleased with it. Here, though, it is amazing - and the price can't be beat! Some other things on the menu are pricey, but the 10 oz. flat iron is an amazing deal for a fantastic steak. If you haven't tried it, you need to. I love it that the kitchen is viewable from the main dining room, which not only makes you feel a bit more secure about who's handling your food, but you can also see the head Chef working and maintaining his line of cooks - such a professional kitchen!   And, of course, if your food is ever not how you ordered it, they take it back and fix it for you, no questions or fuss. Once, my sister's medium steak was clearly well done, no pink at all to it. When we pointed that out, the server took the steak back, we had another out very quickly, and were given an apology for the hassle. The service here is always a delight.   So, yes, once again best steak in town! Go try it. Now."}
