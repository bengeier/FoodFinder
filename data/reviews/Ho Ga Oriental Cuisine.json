{"text":"Great go-to place for lunch in the Path. Good meal at under $10. I'd recommend getting kampungi or chicken katsu w/ curry sauce on top.  Heads up: Cash only and their kimchi is pretty salty and not what you will be expecting."}
{"text":"One of my go-to on Fridays when I don't bring lunch...authentically Korean...  Fish katsu or traditional bibimbap (comes with bowl of broth as well) are my usual order. Portions are decent for the price.  Go early to avoid lineups that usually starts around 11:45am.  Limited seating, but most people are there for takeout."}
{"text":"Delicious quick serve Korean food. The serving sizes are perfect and are priced very well for the financial district. You don't feel gross after polishing off a meal here, but you won't be hungry either. Deep fried items are not greasy. The bibimbap and fish katsu are my go to meals.  You get 2 sides with most meals. Their kimchi is amazing! It's the only kimchi I have been able to eat on its own. Not too strong, but still full of flavour. I also really enjoy the glass noodles.   Don't worry when you see the line. It moves quickly and it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Probably the best lunch option inside the PATH. Their traditional bibimbap is my fave so far."}
{"text":"When I first saw the prices on the menu board I had to squint to make sure that there wasn't an extra \"1\" in front of all the numbers ($5.64 and not $15.64?). Then I told myself that this place must be serving snack portions. Or maybe there's an extra charge for rice or water or something equally ridiculous.   No such thing! I was quite astonished to see the server stuffing the regular sized styrofoam box with quite a bit of meat and a variety of colourful sides. The food was very tasty - well balanced on the flavour side - although perhaps not the most high quality or super fresh. I found that the rice was slightly clumpy, the noodles pretty greasy, and a large percentage of the chicken was fat. But I was so excited at the prospect of a filling and delicious meal at such a low price I may have overlooked all this. :P  Service is...kind of mixed? Young guy serving us food - very friendly and helpful. Old guy manning the cash register - rather unfriendly and impatient. You'd think their attitudes should be switched, but ah well.  Connected to the PATH! Can't be sure of the name of the building this place is located in (is it Standard Life?) but it's linked directly to the TD Centre and to the Exchange Tower (also steps away from FCP)."}
{"text":"Ridiculously well-priced ($6.42), despite the fact that there wasn't much tempura or bulgogi in my Tempura & Meat combo.  If you get just the bulgogi, however, the beef seems to be piled much higher on the rice.  No wonder there's such an insanely long lineup during the lunch hour - the wait time was roughly 15 minutes from the end of the line to the front.  Quality is so-so, but very fair for the price.  The place is very small, with only maybe 6 seats total, so be prepared to take away your styrofoam box.  Make sure you bring cash, as it's cash-only!"}
{"text":"Really delicious and fair price. Only have gotten beef bulgogi a few times but it's great. Not the healthiest but tastes great. Try to go earlier to avoid the long lines."}
{"text":"Great little shop for lunch time takeouts in the PATH. A good menu pick there is the fish katsu. Cash only is bit of drawback."}
{"text":"Tasty and affordable. This place offers good value.  I always get their vegetable soondobu and can never finish all the food. Service is fast but not very friendly, especially the cashier. He always make you feel like you are bothering him when you're the paying customer...lol. and he always seem like he's in a rush even if you are the only customer there. If they work on their customer service, this place will definitely get 5 stars."}
{"text":"I thought it was not possible to pay $7-$8 for lunch nowadays in the downtown financial district core of Toronto. Ho Ga Oriental Cuisine definitely made it possible. This place is even cheaper in terms of price than fast food places. No wonder it draws huge crowds during the weekday lunch rush hour.   They have many different choices from chicken katsu to bulgogi to curry. I usually order the chicken katsu and they offer 2 sides choices like coleslaw, pasta, jap chae noodles, salad, etc. I find that the earlier you go before the lunch rush around 11:30am, the more choices you have for sides.   Good portions. Cash only though."}
{"text":"Easily one of the best lunch spots in the financial district!  Ho Ga has been around for years, since before I started working in the area as a student in 2009. They rennovated the restaurant in 2014 to its current state.   In short: It's cheap, tasty and filling. You can't even get these prices in many suburb restaurants in Markham/Scarb anymore! $7 for a rice, beef, tempura combo with side jap chae and salad? STEAL.   I've always liked their bulgogi here. Chicken teriyaki is okay, its their cheapest option but I'd rather \"splurge\" an extra dollar for the beef. I've tried their curry and its a big hit for my coworkers but I always stick with the beef+tempura combo.   There's even seating in the little restaurant and they offer free water but it's always very busy for a table so come early or come late.   The only small con: They are CASH ONLY. It's a tad annoying, but that's how they evade taxes and keep prices low. Not an unusual tactic anyways.   Strongly recommend this if you're working in the financial district and feeling some Asian foods."}
{"text":"I passed by around 11:40, knowing that there will be a huge lunch rush coming up. There were already 5 or 6 people queued up, but that's alright it's better than 20.  But service is pretty fast: there are usually 2 or 3 people filling orders. So even a long line dwindles down pretty fast.  When I left 3 minutes later, there was another 15 people lining up.  A sign at the front says \"cash-only\", so be wary.  == Menu  Menu comes with an assortment of dishes including teriyaki, katsu, donburi, chicken curry, bibimbap, udon noodle soup, along with some appetizers.  Most of these options include two sides of your choice, such as sweet potato noodles, kimchi, bean sprouts, green broccoli and some other options.  Everything on the menu is under $7. The most expensive items go for $6.99, but they average $6, and there are a couple items going for $5.10, such as a box of teriyaki chicken.  == Food  Asked for the chicken teriyaki, with noodles and kimchi on the side. Comes with white rice. It didn't look like much in the take-out box, but after plating it, it's a pretty good portion.  The chicken had a particularly interesting flavor. I don't know if it was just the sauce they used, or the way they prepared it, but it had the distinct chicken flavor that you would get when you boil chicken as opposed to grilling or frying.  Basically the chicken tasted like chicken. The sides were fillers for the most part. They really pack it in though.  It's a good place if you're on a budget and don't like to bring in homecooking."}
{"text":"Cheap and yummy, perfect for lunch.  I enjoy the tofu soup here very much although I wouldn't say the food is authentic. For $7 I got the tofu soup with rice, jap char and chickpea salad. Was very satisfied."}
{"text":"Went on Black Friday and beat the lunch hour rush by going just before noon! Definitely great value, with lunches being either $7 or $8 after taxes, cash-only and a small seating area.   Service: Line went pretty quick, with 3 people serving food and a cashier, portions may vary depending on which server you get. Looks like a family-run business, friendly people.  Food: Bibimbap was decent and a good portion size, and the gochujang was flavorful. Only wish the food was a bit more warm, but obviously it's not fair to compare it against one served in a stone bowl at a restaurant. Fried eggs were pre-made and a bit cold. DIY sauce bar for condiments (sriracha, gochujang, etc.). Glass noodles tasted good, and good variety of veggie included in the dish.  Overall: Great value for take-out lunch, would definitely recommend when craving Korean food."}
{"text":"It's a quick serve korean restaurant and cash only place.  There are decent amount of food items on the menu but the quality is absolutely sub-par. The price on all items are quite cheap but I feel that the quality is still below its price in my opinion. Considering this is the only korean resto near by my work and I hoped it could be my go to but after trying it out for 3 times, I've decided that I will never return back to this place.  The service is sub par as well.. very difficult to any of the workers smile in this place."}
{"text":"CASH ONLY. THEY DO NOT TAKE CARDS OR ANY FORM OF DIGITAL CURRENCY.  Food is a 4 / 5 considering the PRICE. I find it a bit too oily, but regarding the portion size, it is perfect.  I had the Korean Chicken, Jap Chae, and kimchi. The Kimchi was NOT what I expected and it was more of chopped cabbages. Aside from that, the rest were decent.  Price is probably the lowest I'll find within a reasonable walking distance. 1 Main, and, 2 sides  for approx. $6.  You can tell that they are a popular place to go because even at 1:30 they still had a line up.   They serve manly Korean dishes, so you will be able to find bulgogi, chicken katsu, fish katshu, bimbimbap (But it was in a Styrofoam and I wouldn't order bimbimbap unless it's in a stone bowl), and tempura. Spice level was good. I would come back here again for sure.  Environment: 3 / 5 Service: 5 / 5 Food: 3 / 5 Price Point: 4 / 5  It's a cheap lunch and does the fix."}
{"text":"Taste is authentic homemade and location is great, also the low price makes the whole thing taste better!"}
{"text":"Korean style Asian food. The food is relatively good and the prices are very reasonable (Chicken Katsu with rice and two sides comes to $7.50, tax included)  Be prepapred for the long lineup!  Cash only!"}
{"text":"Great price for a cheap Korean fast food meal in the PATH. Most of the items come with rice and two sides and can fill you up for around $7 with tax.   Don't get the potatoes, they're kind of crappy. I usually get the japchae, broccoli or pasta salad as a side."}
{"text":"How is it possible that no one has written about Ho Ga yet?  This is an awesome place to hit for a (rare) cheap lunch in the Financial District!  My fave here is their kimchi fried rice.  SOOO good.  I've tried to replicate it at home and I just can't.  I probably don't use enough oil.  But the fried rice at Ho Ga is super savoury and fragrant and deliciously salty (but not too much).  However, it's not for health nuts because it is OILY - especially if you go late and get a serving from the bottom of the pan.  The pan (and your lunch box) will be covered in a thick layer of bright red oil.  It's delicious, but not for every day.  It also comes with chunks of chicken breast (*sigh* so sad they cater to a multicultural crowd because chicken thighs would be so much better!) and squares of juicy bacon.  The kimchi in it comes in large pieces.  So, so good and just for $6.50 (plus a choice of 2 sides)!  Where else in the Financial District could you find a meal for that price, and such a high yummy factor?  The fried fish is also good, but heavy.  They're generous with the portions though (which is not the case for fried rice orders).  To substitute the white rice for kimchi fried rice is an extra $2 only, which is very satisfying.  I can't remember how much this is though - I think maybe $6.75 with plain rice?  You also get a choice of 2 sides.  I've yet to try their donburi but to be honest, I'm happy to just keep eating the kimchi fried rice!  TIP: *I'd recommend against choosing kimchi as a side because they seem to use long, thick pieces of regular cabbage that hasn't been fermented long enough (traditional nappa cabbage is far superior!) *go early (I once arrived at about 12:30pm to a massive line; 20 minutes later when it was my turn to order, they were out of kimchi fried rice and weren't planning to make more so I was super hangry)"}
