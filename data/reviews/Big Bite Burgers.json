{"text":"Been around for a while, and always have good eats.  Lots of side to choose from, but they aren't all hits.  The burger is exquisite, and always cooked to order.  The interior is nostalgic, sure, but really just cluttered and painful to look at.  But for a summer's day lunch while shopping, this spot cannot be beat."}
{"text":"Oh Burgers, how do I love thee? Let me count the ways. Starting from your juicy charred meatiness inside, to your fresh hot and cold toppings all the way through to the tip of your toasted buns *wink*. Some say were not good for another, but I know inside your right for me.
My ardent love for burgers made my recent trip Big Bite Burger all the more disheartening, as I felt that past the fun exterior signage and cheeky table tops with giant bite marks taken out of each corner, the heart of the establishment (their burgers) struggled to beat. 

This is not to say that the little burger shop located on Eglington Ave, West of Bathurst made a bad burger, heck no burger is a \"bad\" in my books, just in need of some minor tweaks.

My recent midweek visit had me hungry and cruising for satisfaction. Drawn into BBB by their décor and signage I addressed the menu ready to chow down. I ordered the #1 (a burger with fries and a drink), added bacon and cheddar cheese and some \"gourmet\" toppings (sautéed mushrooms and onions) at an incremental cost - CUZ THAT'S HOW WE DO. In addition I subbed my fries for sweet potato fries. 

After paying I was asked to have a seat while they prepared it, and after several minutes I was asked to come up to pick my toppings. One thing I noticed was that the sweet potato fries were not fresh cut as they were advertised on the menu and in fact frozen (I know a definite TSK ). Also, my \"gourmet toppings\" were not freshly prepared or hot for that matter and were sitting pre made in a bowl to be added with my other burger accoutrements (TSK TSK).

The burger then came off the grill and it was added to my topping selection with some slightly overcooked (ok very overcooked) bacon. I decided at this point that I would stop nit picking and that this must be how they do things here and I would judge the finished product as a whole. 

Sigh... final judgement was not much better, points for providing a sizeable pattie that was well cooked internally BUT charred black on the exterior. The Bun wasn't toasted, and do you remember the cold/supposed to be warm toppings? Fell flat. Over all the taste was pretty good - but I cant be sure if that was because of how hungry I was at that point. 

As I mentioned earlier, it was an OK burger, not my favorite, so I will venture back in the future and given them another shot and hopefully they can change my mind. I'm all about second chances after all :)"}
{"text":"Really nice staff. Long wait. Decent, but average burgers. Meh."}
{"text":"Decent burger, bun was a bit crusty. Fries are ok, not bad for what seems to be a home style burger. Great customer service."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've ever had especially for it's price. Patient, friendly staff and nice interior to eat with friends."}
{"text":"The name of the restaurant should serve as a warning because Big Bite burgers are as big as they come! Big Bite Burger is your typical neighborhood burger joint: cheap prices, fast service, and tasty burgers.

I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to health conscious foodies out there. Their burgers are quite greasy, and their fries are fried in the same oil that is used for frying the meat. There's a veggie burger option, but I can't attest to its healthiness. If I were on a diet, I would definitely skip this place."}
