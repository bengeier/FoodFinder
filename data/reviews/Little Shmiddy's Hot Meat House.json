{"text":"Charming service ,intimate room and great food! Depth and complexity beyond the local neighborhood place that it appears to be at first glance. It will become a regular spot for sure. Worth going out of the way for!"}
{"text":"After several visits I had to finally write up a review on this place.  I have this thing where I can tell if my dinner was cooked with love.  You know it because you can taste the details, the freshness, the layering of flavours and spices, the presentation.  
At Little Shmiddy's every plate is on point ... you can tell that every recipe was thoughtfully planned out. What you think of as the most basic fare always has an element of a pleasant surprise.  Let's take the burger and fries with it's maple glazed onions (at least that's what I think they are) and the most amazing cheese (I got to ask what kind it is b/c even though I shouldn't be eating cheese, I don't care, it's that good).  Yesterday I tried the fried chicken... it was curried fried chicken!!! Very different but extremely delicious.  There has not been one item on the menu that has disappointed me.
The appetizers are just as wonderful as the mains, the beet salad with goat cheese is crazy good (yes I know cheese again .. but goat cheese is ok).  The shrimp cocktail is a meal in a glass.  After chowing down on the most perfectly grilled and seasoned shrimp you get to enjoy the most amazing salad and salsa.  
The portion sizes are perfect, you won't be taking home any doggie bags but you will be leaving fully satisfied.  When you look at the artistry and the quality of food being served, you are getting great value for your money,  
The ambiance in the restaurant is cozy and warm and lots of fun.  The servers are extremely friendly and helpful and the kitchen is eager to please.
You have to try it.  I'll try to remember to take some pics to add to this review.  \"Chow\" for now."}
{"text":"I'm a fan. I'm a huge fan. 

I arrived at this small, cozy restaurant for a private bday dinner last night. I was completely blown away by our 9 course, 3 hr long meal. There were so many amazing delights throughout our meal! 

From the perfectly pickled beets  and thinly shaved flowers of amazing cheese in the charcuterie plate to beef cheeks so soft it makes you want to cry, and... ohhhh the perfect crunch when you bite into the pork belly. The main pieces were amazing, but Little Shmiddy's knew how to up the experience even more, by throwing in these perfect little surprises and flavorful delights on the side. They know how to cook their veggies and dessert just as well as their meat!! I can go on and on, but I wouldn't want to spoil all the fun. 

The owners and waitress were all extremely friendly and wonderful, making the night an even more memorable one. Hands down one of my favorite dining experiences in this city. Check it out!!"}
{"text":"Michael is a fantastic chef. His dishes are always inspiring and interesting. The specials are KILLING. Each experience has truly been transcendent. 

The atmosphere is great, the staff are great. It only gets better and better with each time we go.

I can't say enough good about the place. Check it out and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is a perfect example of why a restaurant cannot solely depend on good food alone. Although their dishes were good, they were nothing overly special; subpar for Toronto's standards from my experience. 
The staff and cook were very disorganized, and the cook was extremely rude to the guests. He insulted one of the guests on her way past the kitchen and accused a table of losing him money for the evening.
The cheese plate was unimpressive. The beef cheek was very well done. I couldn't tell you how the salad was because it was spilt over one of the guests before she had a chance to try it. 
Understandably it is a new restaurant. They need to work on better consumer service, because at the end of the day, a good menu draws you in but the atmosphere is what keeps you coming back."}
{"text":"I'm somewhat reluctant to write a good review here because the restaurant is a bit small and I want to be able to get in on a regular basis. 

A nice cozy spot with well priced, very good, food."}
{"text":"Hands down the best food in Cabbagetown!  Their burgers are amazing and they definitely have the best Reuben sandwich you will ever taste.  So freakin good.  Even their salads are to die for.  Everything is prepared to perfection and with obvious care.  The seating is very limited so make a reservation or come early.  It'll be worth it!"}
{"text":"OK y'all. You gotta try this place!! The food here was freaking off the hook, all super reasonably priced. Recently opened in cabbagetown, this hidden gem was one of the best meals I've had in a long time! Started with the chatcuterie board with homemade saucisson sausage, tete de moine cheese and pickled beets. The cheese was shaved off from a cheese wheel by rotating the blade on top making a light airy shaved ice texture which was super cool, rarely is cheese served like this. Everything worked so well together.

The braised beef cheek was fantastic. Melt in mouth, flavorful, paired nicely with the demi glace, broccolini, and bread pudding. 

Overall vibe was great. decor is so nice and homey, and the owners are just simply so passionate about their food. 

This place was so good, wow. Seriously. Go."}
{"text":"Amazing service and even better food, walked by the Resteraunt a couple times and decided to try it out and I am very happy we did. 

The potato wedge appetizer was beautifully seasoned with just the right amount of salt and fresh thyme. For the main, I ordered one of the specials; pasta with brisket and a tomato sauce. It was delicious and the portion size was perfect.  My friend ordered the beef cheeks, which came with an au jus, potato pur√©e, warmed spinach and pesto. Also delicious. We would definitely order everything we ordered and come again.

The atmosphere is warm and cozy and the staff is very hospitable. Call ahead to make a reservation as there is limited seating."}
{"text":"Space is cramped and uncomfortable. Our group of 5 arrived when the place was nearly empty and was given a small table for 4, even though there was a table for 6 which was later given to a group of 3. When the food arrived, the server handed the plates to us (not placing them on the table) and left us holding them since there was no way to actually fit them on the small table.

Service was horrible and the waiter was unpleasant. One friend asked if he could have some extra veggies instead of the potatoes that came as the sides to his beef cheek, and was told absolutely not.

Food was delicious! We had a number of different main dishes and starter dishes and they were all fantastic. It was more than I expected to pay, and longer than I wanted to wait, but not unreasonable."}
{"text":"Great place!  The small space allows for fun interaction with the staff.  RSVP is highly recommended as they only seat around 18.   The duck confit was great, but a tad on the salty side.   I would definitely come back - probably for Brunch !"}
{"text":"The food was excellent and of a standard one would expect to find in a high-end restaurant or hotel. It is a charming, cozy, rustic little place that holds only about a dozen patrons. That said, i found it pricey ($13 for two small coffees and two refills) and i felt the server came on a little strong with her repartee."}
{"text":"Torontotarians, this is what you call a hidden gem! This little cozy restaurant blew my mind with both incredible food and service. We had reserved the place for a personal event; therefore, the items ordered may be different than the menu. I would highly recommend this restaurant hands down!

Charcuterie (5/5) - This is easily one of the best charcuterie I have ever had. The texture of the shaved cheese was surreal. The meats were extremely fresh. A perfect start to the night. You have to try this! It is simply amazing!

Tartare (4.5/5) - Extremely fresh and flavourful. A little splash of pesto olive oil makes the whole dish work so well together. 

Braised Beef cheek and pork belly (5/5) - Oh my god. The most tender and juicy piece of meat as it just melts and falls apart in your mouth. The texture from the crunchy pork belly added depth to the plate. 

I had lost count after the third course because I was too busy eating and savoring the flavours. One of the best restaurants I have tried yet and defnitely has the \"Wow\" factor. Highly recommended!

Note to self and a warning to all customers. If you attempt to do pullups on the moose antlers, wear a helmet."}
{"text":"Incredible food!!!! Amazing cosy environment. 
Pork, brisket, beef cheek, chowder, fries, potato skins.... all amazing. 

Wine is reasonable, 24 for a bottle of sangiovese. 

Chef makes it a truly personable experience for guests..... wonderful all around."}
{"text":"Great little place in Cabbagetown. Charcuterie board was perfect for two and the burger was amazing. Great food at a decent price. Our server was also excellent."}
{"text":"First, this place is teeny-tiny. There is no back room. We just wandered in on Valentine's Day morning and lucked into a table, but that's only because it was so so cold we were the only idiots outside. Make a reservation.

I got the open faced brisket sandwich, because what else would you get? It was exceptional. Everything was just so. The plating was beautiful. The service was on point.

Even though I was super happy with my food, I kept looking longingly at things other people ordered. We were told that the menu changes pretty regularly. So this needs to be part of your regular rotation or you are missing out."}
