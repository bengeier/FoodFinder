{"text":"I have been going to this bar for 10 years it always was a mixed fun bar to drink and dance however the bar is nothing like it used to be..its no longer a fun club it has turn into a ghetto bar, underage drinking, fighting and police there every weekend... I will not be going back anymore.. can't believe the owner let his bar turn into a dive it will be closed down soon...."}
{"text":"Friday and Saturday nights they play rap and r&b, if you're into that sort of thing you'll love it here. If not, go somewhere else. 

The Latino looking bartender (feel bad I forgot his name) is great. He's so hot.

Bathrooms--disgusting. 

Smoking and pool in the back of the bar, big dance floor. 

Not my scene, but it's a typical sweaty nightclub. However, if you're square then I can guarantee you will hate it here. If you like smoking, partying, dancing and loud rap music, this place has everything you're looking for. Including a gritty hotel attached. 

The bar area doesn't have tables setup for the 'grown and sexy.' I think that would help. Also, it would be nice if they served food, especially something that would help you avoid the worst hangover the next day (because you were dragged here by you're friend, completely out of you're element and drank yourself into a coma)."}
{"text":"I made the mistake of stopping in here one night with a friend for no other reason than to satisfy our curiosity.

I immediately knew I was way out of my element as the place was filled with what seemed to be teenagers.  I'm no cop, but I spotted several illegal activities occuring in the short time it took to finish my drink.

From the bartender having a wonderful white ring of crust around their nostril to the plethora of underage kids getting fall off their barstool drunk.  This is a place that I fully expect Carl Monday to investigate one day in the near future.

The music was extremely loud, and there was an overuse of black lights throughout the, er, establishment.  I suppose this helps make all of the tanerexic Snooki wannabes look 40 rather then their presumed 17 years of age."}
