{"text":"Extremely overpriced for the amount of food you get. I used to go here all the time. The food was delicious. 

What changed was the portion of food. Most places increase prices when they need to. Not this place. No, what they did here is a disgusting disservice to the customer. They instead lessened the portion of the food by more than twice it was. It's less than the kids portion compared to some places. Yes! So now if you want the similar portion that you had before, then you have to pay for it twice. I think it would still be less than what one portion was though. Which makes this restaurant now grossly overpriced. 

For example, the last time I went here I had a combo plate that was the beef and chicken teriyaki with spam. I asked for no beef and replace with more spam. This is what I usually used to get. So you know what they gave me? 2 tiny pieces of spam! The chicken portion was also minuscule. And a tiny scoop of rice too, not even a whole scoop. 

I eat at many places in Vegas and around the country as I travel all the time. I mostly use yelp to give great reviews for amazing places that need more attention from customers. This place though, I logged in for the first time in a long time to give this one star review. It is that bad compared to what they used to be. It is way more expensive than every Manhattan non-waiter place I have been to, along with Chicago, Boston, Seattle, Miami, Toronto, etc. 

Guys, if this portion issue has changed please let me know. I will then try it again and see for myself and update my review accordingly. I used to love this place, but now it just still gets me mad when I think about what I paid for and then got.

UPDATE: May 2017
I want back again to see if they changed anything. I went back again to see if it was a fluke. It looks like they did raise the portions. Not as big as it used to be but this is much better then before where I gave a one star review. Food was still delicious!"}
{"text":"I am from Dallas Texas, visiting my aunt and uncle and had the most enjoyable experience at Aloha Kitchen. You walk in and are immediately greater by an employee with a smile and welcoming hello. The friendliness is matched perfectly with the good portioned and delicious food. I asked a couple questions about the menu and the cashier had wonderful answers and advise. I had the teriyaki chicken and coconut shrimp and would highly recommend trying them.

Awesome experience!"}
{"text":"I've never been disappointed with Aloha Kitchen...well, other than showing up on a Monday ready for lunch and then remembering they are closed on Mondays. My personal favorite is the Mix 1 plate...lightly battered fried mild white fish, teriyaki chicken, rice and salad. Time to update the decor though, been the same for a couple decades now."}
{"text":"I ordered the hamburger steak, one of my favorite foods. I got really excited to see a huge hamburger patty, like the size of your face huge. The I cut into it and the coloring was kind of funny.. I inspected it better to come to the conclusion that about 98% of the patty consisted of some type of filler. bread maybe? I have no idea, it's like the color of breakfast sausage patties. I feel kind of grossed out eating this. I can see areas where there is actually hamburger in there to compare with the filler. I don't understand why anyone would have the audacity to make a \"hamburger\" patty this way. I am extremely disappointed, still hungry, and grossed out. Hamburger Steak is NOT recommended, it is NOT hamburger."}
{"text":"Very good food. Very little wait time. My favorite was the Kalua Pig. It was a little salty just like had it in Hawaii. Soooo Good.  The ribs were great and my very hungry family all filled up for just under $28. Atmosphere was fun and friendly to families.  And the booths gave us plenty of space to sit and talk story a while.  Best plate in town. I will return often."}
{"text":"Damn that was good. I got the mini sweet and sour chicken and it was enough for two small lunches. Great sauce, rice and chicken. The mac salad was some of the best I've had from a restaurant. Not a single complaint with service. All were nice. It was cool to be given a piece of cantaloupe with my lunch. Highly recommended. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Over priced with a small portions on your plate.  I got the mahi mahi plate one time i went there and i im eating 99% egg and 1% fish!! im like are you serious? worst hawaiian food restaurant in vegas....go somewhere else where you get what you paid for! go to Ross J's on Sunset...Decent price with alot on your plate."}
{"text":"First bite was a winner! Chicken katsu melted in the mouth and the bulgogi tender and tasty. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Sometimes the wait is a bit for some katsu.. but this place is sooooo good.... I stip by for loco moco or katsu almost weekly for lunch...."}
{"text":"Good Food! Conveniently near UNLV! Awesome place to go chill and hang out. I like their chicken teriyaki bowl and katsu chicken! The musubi is great as well. Definitly recommend for casual dining."}
{"text":"I wouldn't go here, they have the worst service ever.  My girlfriend and always go here. but not anymore. This is the the 4th time the girl at cashier doesn't even acknowledge us and she always mad dogging us for no reason. When it was my turn to order, I was saying what I wanted she just stand there and she didn't even say I'm not taking you or anything. She just look to the other cashier. On top of that they alway cheat on the plates. We weren't welcome when we walked in and obviously they didn't acknowledge us leaving. That lady cashier is perhaps one of the worst cashier I've ever dealt with."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to get dinner here because it was still open at 9pm, but on retrospect it was a bad idea. 

To start, the dish we ordered was way too salty. We ordered a pulled pork dish with cabbage that was basically lathered in soy sauce. The thing that really bothered us was when we told the server that the dish was too salty, she just looked at us and told us there was nothing she could do about it because her boss made it that morning.  

Basically if you want salty pulled pork that will raise your blood pressure, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Hands down, most delicious Hawaiian food I've had since moving to The Phoenix area. I have dreams about the macaroni/potato salad."}
{"text":"First time here and the cashier was very rude . The food wasn't to bad either but I wasn't impressed at all ."}
{"text":"Frequented this place often when I used to work on Nellis AFB.  Brought a katsu/kalua pig mixed plate back to the office one day and everyone wanted to try some on first scent.  It turned into a weekly affair and people would actually get mad (one of my coworkers wanted to throw down once because we didn't let him know we were going) if they weren't notified.  The teri chicken/teri beef plate was a general favorite along with the aforementioned katsu/kalua plate.  My favorite though, was the fried rice omelette.  I used to go so often that as soon as I walked in, the girls would already order it for me.  I miss this place a lot."}
{"text":"The adobo fried rice omelette is so good (thanks for all the recommendations, yelpers!).  The adobo meat is really tender and there are big chunks of it throughout the fried rice.  I could eat this every day!  Sometimes I get the adobo on its own and it's really good too.

The chicken curry is also really good and full of chicken and veggies.  When you order take out, you get a really big container full of curry and a large plate of rice.

This place gets really busy around lunch and dinner so you may want to call in your order beforehand."}
{"text":"If you want very, very good \"local\" food, this is the place to go. Located in an easy to miss strip mall, this is no 'upscale' establishment. It doesn't need it. The food is superb. I have eaten here numerous times and tried just about everything on the menu. One must have: manapua. They are melt in your mouth good! Their teri-chicken is flavorful and always comes with \"2 scoop\" rice. You will not go hungry here. Even their \"mini\" plates are plentiful.

If you come on a lucky day, get the haupia (coconut pudding/cake). 

Perfect for a lowkey, great meal, any day of the week!"}
{"text":"Food was good, but customer service was bad. Not enough water jugs, expected to take water jugs from other people table to just get water. Says aloha kitchen, but no aloha given."}
{"text":"Tasty food (I had the mixed sampler plate), large & satisfying portion, good service, economical, and VERY friendly!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff. Loved the Mahi Mahi plate with rice and Mac. Grilled to juicy perfection. The teriyaki sauce was spot on. Will be back to try more selections."}
{"text":"never disappoints!

the adobo fried rice omelette keeps me coming back!  everything is else (chicken katsu, adobo, lumpia) is good too but not craveable.  that omelette tho, IS CRAVEABLE.  

see you guys there!"}
{"text":"I love the food at this place.  One of the most authentic Hawaiian restaurants in the valley.  

I highly recommend the food at Alpha Kitchen to anyone craving \"plate lunch\" from The Islands."}
{"text":"Well this WAS one of my favorite cheap eats in town... Until today.  First we order our usual lualua and kalua pig.   EVERY time we have been here prior there was cabbage in the kaulua pig.  After questioning the guy says not on this plate.  Basically telling me I have no clue what I'm talking about.  Ok fine.  Moving on to eating.  I ventured out and got the wonton soup.   The ramen noodles in it made it a winner.   The overpowering taste of rotten fish made it a loser.   I didn't last more than two bites and I was back at the counter ordering my usual Kalbi.  He ignores my saying three times the soup was horrible.   I even took the soup bowl and put it on top of the trash still hot. I pay for the Kalbi and wait.   When it comes out It looks great but It's chewier than normal.   My boyfriend eats a bite and I eat another.  We realize it's raw.  I take it back to the counter. The girl there is super sweet and takes it to the kitchen.  The cooks seem upset at her as she's showing them it's raw.  The go to cook it and I ask for my money back.  I get just the money for the Kalbi not the soup too.  My boyfriends Hawaiian plate was fine despite no cabbage.  He leaves full.  I leave hungry and prepping for a hospital visit.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Decent Hawaiian BBQ. Giving 3 stars because it was comparable to franchises such as Ono Hawaiian BBQ or L&L.  I expect mom and pop shops to be more unique in flavor and this just didn't have that extra kick I was looking for. Siamin bowl was bland and broth was salty like the packaged ramen noodles.  Mixed plate with bulgogi and teriyaki chicken was good and portion was plentiful. Friendly and clean atmosphere."}
{"text":"Food and environment here are amazing! I'm from out of town, but I would eat here everyday if they had one close to me.  The island hot wings are my personal favorite."}
{"text":"Great place if you are craving local Hawaiian food!!! I am going back home to Hawaii soon but had a craving for mac salad and chicken katsu. Gotta say I was very happy with the food!"}
{"text":"Service can be slow, but they have da kine, you know.  Good island food.  Plus, where else can you get good LauLau pork in da desert?

5 coconuts"}
{"text":"Great service, wait staff is cheery and helpful. Plenty of condiments available, BBQ bread is fantastic. Menu is reasonably priced. +1 for having sriracha!"}

{"text":"Have you ever had their wings here??? It's a must. Some may say it's a little sweet, but it has the sweet and tangy mixture fried to perfection. I LOVE their wings. (it's their special sauce ;) ) 

We also had the salmon platter, which was ok. Standard. I liked the macaroni salad. I always enjoy that here. 

They say they don't sell the manapau (sp? - char sui bao/sweet pork bun) on Sundays, but we asked, and they had it and made it for us. I remember it being a little better before, but maybe because we didn't eat it right away... it got a little hard and wasn't as good as I remembered. Oh well, lesson learned - eat the pau right when it comes out - hot and fresh. 

Employee at the counter was very friendly. I was with a big group and she was very accommodating. It's a nice simple, casual place to eat. Good for a laid back place. Homey feel. Me likes!"}
{"text":"Aloha has a special place in my heart. Their food is what I crave. From the teriyaki chicken to the shrimp, it's great food. I love the potato mac salad and they always have little side items for sale like masubi or coconut cake. I'd have more to say about their other items but you'd have to pry me away from the teriyaki chicken plate first--good luck with that. The atmosphere is casual and the staff is always cheerful and welcoming. The prices are quite affordable as well! I have been eating here once a week for months. They don't do extended hours though so get here early!"}
{"text":"Ho, brah...heard dis place was da kine, went here wikiwiki at pau hana time....Finding ono grinds in Arizona is tough, yeah. Evens do, Arizona has choke local people. Whadda gives, you say brah? Do local people stop liking Hawai'ian food when dey come to da mainland? Ho don't look at me, brah, I'll nevah forget my first time grinding at Rainbows, washing down my plate lunch with a slush float...but anywayz....

Aloha Kitchen ain't Rainbows brah. It hints at da Islands with a linoleum floor and basic tables and chairs. (Dis assumes brah you come on a day other than Mondays, when da Kitchen is pau.) But as you walk around don't expect to see like shave ice, or spam musubi, or some guy with a wet okole.  Still, it's casual and relaxed and usually not loud n crazy.

Not that I know fo sure brah. I always get da kalbi to go, and don't stick around der long. So you says to youzeself, brah, dis fella order one thing on da menu and he's gonna tell me how dis place broke da mouth? Brah, fo reals. Da proof is in da mac salad, scoops of rice, youze name it. Go to a chain like L&L or Ono....you see what I mean, bumbye. 

Aloha Kitchen is strictly a counter place. Da grinds may come with a touch of ohana...but don't expect anyone to serve you. You order, you pay, an den you grind brah, An wen you done, you talk story until you're pau. Still, da girl at da counter is choke friendly, and never rude.

Whuzzat youze say? Doesn't everything in Hawai'i cost more? Especially grinds? Fo sure brah...a trip to a supermarket in Hawaii can give you chicken skin. Good news is brah, da Kitchen won't do that. As of yet, nothing is over $10...but den again, is it gonna stay dat wayz fo evahs? No ways, brah, no ways. 

S if it is take out you crave, and you don't feel like Subwayz, or Mickey D's, den take youze opu to Aloha Kitchen, You'll be hundred of miles away from da beach, or waterfalls, or an ABC Store...But...you'll be full...an not just of aloha brah."}
{"text":"Ever since my cousin introduced me to this place, I have to make a stop.. every time I'm in vegas.

Adobo Omelet.

It can feed 2.

It's AMAZING.

That's all :)"}
{"text":"Food is really good! Service is quick. Prices are good, especially for how much food they give you! My favorites here are the katsu chicken, teriyaki chicken and there macaroni salad is so good! An all around good place to get some yummy Hawaiian food"}
{"text":"Been going here for a while so I tried many of their items. While the musubi and manapua seem a little expensive, their loco moco is reasonable. The servers are always polite and are able to substitute some items (ask for teriyaki chicken instead of teriyaki beef)."}
{"text":"I love's me some real Hawaiian plate lunch...

whenever I'm in Vegas, I'm sure to get my fix here.  (I kno, I kno, it's not Oahu, but it's usually the closest I can get from NYC)

not far from the main strip, you just take Tropicana Ave east until you hit Maryland Parkway. 

these guys seem to close fairly early (10pm) but I hear that the overly touristy one on Decatur Ave stays open til 5am!"}
{"text":"Aloha Kitchen is great Hawaiian food at a great price! I got a Local Plate for a little over $8, it had Terriaki chicken and beef, 2 Spam Masubi's and Mac salad mmmmm goooddd ;) I think this is a newer location and not many people are here when I go but spread the word if you want Hawaiian food in the Sunset Station area! Its well worth it :)"}
{"text":"AK hits the spot every time! I normally drop in for lunch once a week. I usually get the chicken curry, loco moco, kalbi beef ribs or the chicken wings. The chicken curry is delicious but it's more like a stew with a heaping of potatoes and not enough chicken imo.  The loco moco is the best I've had outside of home cooking. And you can never go wrong with the kalbi here. Not a lot of fat on the bone, but just enough to give the beef that nice flavor. Those kalbi ribs make me want to slap somebody's mama because they're delicious."}
{"text":"Food is so Ono and Josie is very very friendly  to everyone she check our table and some other tables too making sure everything is ok very very nice young lady"}
{"text":"Great hawaiian food, like being on the islands.. exactly what a hawaiian place should be, cheap, great food in a friendly atmosphere, simple dishes with plenty of mac salad and spam. good stuff. its a few miles off the strip so it'll give you a feel of what vegas is like outside the glitz and glamor.

there were locals, college kids, and regular, blue collar people eating there (that says something... it's good)

i highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is kinda awkward, but their food is great. Their mac salad is really good, I wish they would use a little less Mayo. Don't get me wrong I eat every last bite! 

The only thing that is annoying about this place is that they have this sign that says they accept visa but they prefer cash because they are a small business & so on & so on. It makes me feel bad when I use my card here. For that reason I have to pass this place up A LOT because I never have cash! Its either your going to accept cards or not. & for me that sign just tells me to not come here w/out cash."}
{"text":"I was first introduced to Aloha Kitchen in 2012 and honestly since then I've been hooked every time I go to Vegas! If you have a craving for Hawaiian BBQ or Filipino food I would definitely recommend coming here! 

My favorites would be the Adobo Fried Rice Omelette and the Chicken Katsu combination plate and for a snack I would suggest ordering a spam masubi or two (LOL).

Coming here is definitely a good choice especially when you have the \"drunchies\"! The workers there are very nice and give suggestions if you haven't been there before!"}
{"text":"Drab location in an unassuming strip mall. Bathroom was so dirty. Service was mediocre at best! We had teriyaki chicken, katsu, and fish. The fish tasted like egg. The chicken was really good. The salad was a store bought bagged salad with thousand island dressing. Katsu was decent."}
{"text":"By far the best place in AZ for Hawaiian food. The staff was friendly, easy to order and you know it's fresh when it takes awhile to get the food. Hit up this place before noon because it gets busy when everyone arrives there for lunch."}
{"text":"After living on plate lunches on Maui for over 25 years, I miss them greatly here in Texas. Went to Vegas last week and ONY BROKE DA MOUT ONO BRAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I wanted to eat there every day, but the wife wouldn't allow it (5 out of 6 days), Food was great!!! Can't wait to go back-extra rice and mac salad everytime!"}
{"text":"The 5 stars are for the food. The restaurant itself is unassuming. You place your order at

 the counter and they bring it to the table when ready. The reason to go to this restaurant is the food. The chicken teriyaki was very tender and flavorful. The coconut shrimp were a nice size not greasy and tender and flavorful. The portions are large so even ordering the \"mini\" portions are more than adequate for most people. In total well worth a trip."}
{"text":"Food is good but service is horrible
 Called in our order still waited 35 mins.  My entire lunch break was wasted waiting. All of the dine in orders that came in after us were served first."}
{"text":"This place is so ono ! Whenever I want local food , it's definitely the go to && the workers are always so nice . I love that they have specials for UNLV students !"}
{"text":"Can we talk about the pricing vs portion size here? One of the best values in Vegas, and the food is always delicious. The chicken curry was literally like double the portion I expected when I got it, and it was delicious. The combo plates are good too."}
{"text":"We are going to play a little game called \"Whats the most important part of a plate lunch\"....any answers? No? I will tell you, It is the rice. Yes, the rice. People like me, who are from Hawaii (Maui) to be specific do not even consider food without rice a meal. So imagine my disappointment when opening my plate lunch and seeing the travesty that was under my kalua pig...it was closer to mochi then it was to rice. Other than that everything was awesome.....it would of been amazeballs if the rice was right."}
{"text":"I love this place..great food workers are very nice and courteous..always show me respect...NEVER had a problem here....that's why I keep coming back they really know how to \"get it right\" the FIRST TIME!!! I tell all my friends and family about how great this place is..2 thumbs up"}
{"text":"I want more delicious chicken teri; it's so good again and again. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Hands down best Hawaiian food I have ever had.  This is legit.  It's home cooked Hawaiian food.  Try the bulgogi and the katsu chicken.  It will blow you mind.  If you are starving and want a pre dinner or maybe just extra delicious foods get the manapua.  This is a sweet bread bun with sweet and sour pork inside.  I'm getting hungry just writing this."}
{"text":"Seriously,  this is my absolute favorite Hawaiian food restaurant. I recommend everything I have every had there. I especially like the Bulkogi, fried saimin, island hot wings, and the best potato-macaroni salad ever.

They have pickup for catering too."}
{"text":"Seriously good Hawaiian eats.  The kalbi is delicious,  the loompia are amazing.   The kalbi sauce is good on everything (except maybe the kimchee).  Good prices for the amount of food you get as well.  Aloha soy sauce is way better than kikkoman!  Nuff said."}
{"text":"First time ordering for myself and my finicky hubby.....WOW, it was all so good.  The beef, short ribs, chicken , scallops, mac salad, rice and the crispy cabbage. And the portions were great especially for the really great prices.
We order take out 1-2 times a week and we will order from here again.

Oh, and the delivery was 25 minutes sooner than quoted!"}
{"text":"Don't believe the other reviews about going up the street to the other place.. The quality of the meats at Aloha is quite a bit better."}
{"text":"Truly delicious and close to authentic Hawaiian plate lunch you'll find on the mainland. Ono's is a great Hawaiian plate restaurant but aloha kitchen stays true to it's menu without getting too franchise-like the way ono's has.  Pork bun rolls. Chicken katsu. Teriyaki chicken. Potato-macaroni salad. Bulgogi pork. Even the cucumber mint water in the dining room water jug is fantastic. Hidden gem in mesa too."}
{"text":"I actually really like this place but at the same time I do have my issues with it. Fisrt of all, let me say that the manapua is to die for. Beyond that the menu is fairly standard Hawaiian. The saimin lacks flavor, the katsu is a little bland, the macpot is macpot.

I will keep going back for the manapua (it's like crack), but I may just skip the rest of the menu"}
{"text":"Best chicken katsu in Arizona.  Been goin here for years, and i guarantee you wont find better hawaiin food anywhere"}
{"text":"I thought the beef stew would b made in a gravy?! It was more like a soup?  I love spam musubi but the last time I ordered.. I could tell the musubi was sitting out for awhile,  corners of the spam were dark n dry n the rice was crispy?  Plus I ordered a side of macaroni it was frozen in the middle."}
{"text":"Super Yum!  We were on our way to a lecture on Art Appraising and I wanted Hawaiian food, so I looked up a place near where we were going and found Aloha Kitchen. 

Gary had been there numerous times before and said it sounded it good to him, so we went!

We shared won tons, and ordered chicken teriyaki and bulgoki and had 2 pineapple orange juices. 

Everything was really super yummy!  Our dishes also came with macaroni-potato salad which was delish! 

AND!  They have a recycling bin for the juice cans! yay!  I'd definitely hit this place up again if I were in the area."}
{"text":"My favorite piece of Aloha in the desert.  We drive from the far West Valley to eat here. Wish we could duplicate them, but no other compares. :)"}
{"text":"this spots on point with the local grinds... i'd say i agree with Melanie A. when she says it's better than L&L... at least the ones here on the mainland...  i checked this spot on a thursday once for some hip hop function... not bad... thanks DZ kids... 

the loco moco... come the fuck on... if you haven't hit it you better get on it mofos... stop sleepin on it... get yours and enjoy..."}
{"text":"Macaroni salad is the best! Also they have different variety of meat. Chicken , beef, and pork. The price is incredible . Try it you are going to love it ..,"}
{"text":"Aloha Kitchen - a true \"Hole in the wall\" or \"mom & pop\" type of place. I've driven past this place many times and always said I wanted to give it a shot. Finally I did with my g/f and it was a joy. The ambiance is very chill and relax. But you come here when you want to eat good food. Good comfort Hawaiian with a bit of Asian flare.

The mix plate combos are the winners here. I guarantee you won't leave the place hungry. So are the specials. 
The Manapua or pork buns(Sipao) are me and my g/f's favorite appetizers. In fact during Saturdays, if me and my g/f are out n' about and we want to get something to snack on, we get the Manapua and some Spam misubi. LOVE IT! We both love spam  misubi and the way it's done here...Awesome.

If you are in the neighborhood and want to get a great meal with a very low key and simple place, come to Aloha. Parking maybe tight since it's a very small strip but again...you come for the food."}
{"text":"AaaalooooHa!  Five star best Hawaiian food right next door to the BEST Pizza (see my Nello's review) in Metro Phoenix!

All in all I first visited the Aloha kitchen next to Nello's as I was craving and on the hunt for some juicy Kalua Pig:  A very tender Hawaiian specialty slow cooked pork normally in an underground pit over coals for at least 5 hours or more! It's got that slightly addictive smoked tast.

{"text":"love their teri chicken and mac salad, brings me right back to hawaii"}
{"text":"I had dinner at this place yesterday. The Chicken well cooked good flavor. The service was great as well attended great place for a family dinner."}
{"text":"I was very surprised when I realized the location of the restaurant and that I had not happened upon it before  This is definitely a 'no-frills\" type of place so it lacked much on decor.  On the Saturday afternoon that I went, I ordered the \"Hawaiian plate\", which if memory serves me right included rice, cabbage, lomi lomi salmon and pulled pork.  It was very disappointing as I found it very bland and dry.  The other dishes looked pretty tasty so maybe I just ordered the wrong item for me on that day.  I will return but will something else."}
{"text":"Service ok. Food not so much. Rice was hard had to take my food back to be replaced. A guy named Kalib was not so helpful at all. The only reason I would come back is because of Joelle. Nice & helpful lady. First time here I got Combo bowl, hamburger steak. Way to much sauce on the bowl."}
{"text":"Ive been going here for 15 years and still love it. Its one of my top 3 lunch places. Personally, I think this ranks up there with \"plate lunch\" style food you find in Maui.

Make sure you try the Manapua - it's a meat-filled bun."}
{"text":"Adobo omelet! Food is definitely delicious, but the service is not so great. After we ordered, we looked for a table, but two tables still had dirty dishes and the table we ended up sitting had didn't have dishes, but had bit and pieces of old food. We asked them to clean the table and they didn't end up cleaning it until we got our food. As busy as they got, I feel like they should hire more people. They needed the help."}
{"text":"I'm giving this restaurant 4 stars because I had only one experience and that was ordering platters of food for a party which ended up quite delicious, I must say.

I was in Vegas recently for a birthday party and decided to have the party in our room instead of at a restaurant and ordered 3 platters.  Teri Chicken, Fried Noodles, and Egg Rolls.

Let me backtrack by saying that I came across Aloha Kitchen by accident, just driving around looking for somewhere to buy the food since I really didn't do much research beforehand.  After having bought a few things from Vons down the street, Aloha Kitchen caught my eye as I was driving along and since I was in a crunch, thought why not check it out since I was sure I'd be familiar with the food.

I asked if they sold platters and was given a party platter menu.  There were quite a few choices but I was a little hesitant at first because of the prices.  $60 for a large platter of Teri Chicken and Fried Saimin, and $40 for 100 pcs of Egg Rolls.  I was expecting 30 people.  I asked how long to make them and was told 30-40 mins.

I ordered and went about my business taking a little less than an hour before going back to pick up my order.  When I arrived, my order was ready and to my surprise, it was a lot larger than I thought it was going to be.  Of course I had to sample them and found that all items were quite tasty.  The Teri Chicken was lightly breaded and the sauce served on the side, every piece of Egg Rolls were cooked golden brown and crispy with a sweet chili sauce served on the side, and the Fried Saimin were mixed with a surprising amount of Charsiu Pork, as well as cabbage and egg.  

I ended up pleasantly surpised, having a lot of left over food and felt that it was well worth the price. 

In summary, considering the fact that I stopped in by chance and had no idea what this place was like, I was quite satisfied with my experience and would eat there again based on the food alone and would definitely order platters from them again.  The next time, I'll probably sit and eat in, and after reading previous reviews, I sincerely hope the service issues has been resolved and that my experience will be just as satisfying."}
{"text":"Love the staff- Joseph and the chef are awesome. Our family loves the BBQ chicken with Mac salad. It is so good. Kalbi combo is also delicious. 

Would be great if the owner would invest in more high chairs. One is not enough for a family restaurant. 

Love the food. Very clean and fresh tasting."}
{"text":"Staff is always friendly and the kalbi is great. The spam musubis remind me of Hawaii."}
{"text":"Let me first start by saying that I have never been a big fan of Aloha Kitchen. Being born and raised in Hawai'i, I am familiar with Hawai'i cuisine and Aloha Kitchen has always been just OK, nothing spectacular.  Living in Las Vegas, Aloha Kitchen has always been the \"last resort\" when wanting to eat Hawai'i cuisine. After my experience yesterday, I felt compelled to write this review. My boyfriend chose to eat here yesterday after visiting the UNLV campus. When we arrived, there was no one in line ordering, so we did not have to wait to place our order. We ordered saimin, adobo fried rice, a cheeseburger and a side of corned beef hash, There was one family of four who just received their food as we sat down. Every occupied table at that point had their food. The restaurant started to get busy as we waited for our food. After 15 minutes, we received our side of hash. Five minutes after that we got the saimin and cheeseburger. The adobo fried rice omelet took 30 minutes!!! RIDICULOUS!! How hard is it to make fried rice with already prepared pork adobo?!! Then about half way through my saimin, I found a hair in the soup!!! SO GROSS! At that time, the waitress was delivering food to a table next to us as I was telling my boyfriend about the hair. I know she heard what I said but made eye contact with me and walked away. I then took the bowl to the guy working the cash register. He apologized and then offered to make me a new bowl of saimin. At that point, I was so disgusted, that I declined offer. He did not offer any other compensation! He just took the bowl and turned away from me and walked to the kitchen. If I could, I would not give any stars but being that I have to select at least one, one it is. The food is a disappointment, the customer service is a disappointment...what more can I say!!!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years. The quality has gone down recently, but it's still the best hawaiian good I've come across in Arizona.  Recommend the bulkogi or the coconut shrimp. Everything cooked to order and authentic."}
{"text":"I grew up in Ewa Beach, HI so it's always nice to find good Hawaiian food. We've heard this was a great place if you're craving Hawaiian cuisine. Kahlua pork and Laulau tastes great! BBQ is great too! Will be back!"}
{"text":"What a fun place!  We were visiting Mesa, and chose Aloha Kitchen based on the Yelp reviews.  What we got was great food, tons of it, and a spirit of aloha!  Will definitely return if we're back in Mesa!"}
{"text":"I wish they had filled Malasada and shave ice with traditional toppings. ( hint hint ) ( that would be a great business move  it would increase revenue popularity and profit. Thier Adobo Omelette is something of inovative splendor and awe hahah. Love their  Laulau its my favorite dish. Although their  rinds are out of this world good for being so far from hawaii the amount of rice does'nt exactly fullfill the filipino/hawaiian/ any islanders palette hahah give a bigger scoop, rice is cheap geez lol, The bar right next door (aloha bar) is an okay kick back spot.... if I could change something about the bar it would most definately be  the smell I know people smoke indoors  in bars but  if you had the smell of the tropics in a bar and maybe play some smooth jams  with better lighting during the day  you increase business in the daytime. well thats  my two cents on this jewel from the Ninth Island Grind spot"}
{"text":"Two stars for the chicken... I am glad I read the reviews to prepare me for my experience. 

We walked in and the cashier is standing behind the counter with her hands on her hips, just staring. So I said, \"Hello, were you waiting for us?\" She just continued to stare with no reaction.

We ask, \"What's good?\"  She says, \"I don't know.\"  A long pause then says, \"Do you have any questions?\"  We replied, \" We just asked you a question.\"

Oh boy.... So we decided to share a meal. 
The fried chicken strip things were good and thats about it. 

And she brought us our food and said if you want an extra plate they're over there. Oh you mean over where you just walked past the extra plates. 

Don't think, pretty sure we wont be back. Mostly positive I will not be craving anything on the menu.....ever. 

Just being honest. When service is this bad personally I don't think it is worth the experience."}
{"text":"Kalbi Ribs are always good. Would like to try other things...but I just order the same ting overtime i go!"}
{"text":"First time here,and the last time going there.order Hawaiian combo plate.it came with a small piece of chicken and thin slice of pork meat and some chop up beef.two small sides of steamed rice and one small mac salad . terrible portions and steamed rice was old and mac had no tuna in it.side of lumpia,and i swear it came out the freezer. Not worth $14.85.i could of made better Hawaiian food at my house.two thumbs down"}
{"text":"Been coming here for 5 years and the food is very tasty. Always recommend them. 

Cons: dining room looks old and staff could show SOME enthusiasm. :) 

This place is under marketed ... More for me."}
{"text":"Best Hawaiian Grinds at affordable prices!"}
{"text":"Strip mall, family owned casual quick serve. Exactly what you would expect for the 'environment' of this restaurant. 
What you might not expect is the flavor!  Excellent dish - mix plate with Bulkogi and Teriyaki Chicken. Absolutely fantastic!"}
{"text":"YUM YUM GIMME SOME...adobo fried rice omelette. (is spell check really telling me it's spelled \"omelet\"?)... If it's just me and the wife, we'll split the adobo fried rice omelet (you win, spell check)  and we might even have some left over to bring to the hotel for a lil snacking later. If it's me and my bro, one of us gets the omelet and the other gets the loco moco and that's usually enough for the both of us. They haven't made me pay extra for asking for a little more adobo in the omelet but please don't ask for this yourself. I feel special. =P To say the food is delicious is an understatement. Since being turned on to the place by our friends, we've yet to make a Vegas trip without stopping here at least once. 

I have no complaints whatsoever about anything here.  Parking is plentiful in the lot out front. The service is friendly from the cashier to the serving of your food. The bathrooms are clean. Yes, I've used both (couldn't wait). There's lots of food for the price you pay, which BTW isn't much. Try it. You'll like it."}
{"text":"5 stars for the galbi platter with l.a.cut ribs chicken katsu and chicken jun. great stuff not too greasy and can feed two"}
{"text":"The food is GREAT! No question about that, I just hope the employees get our orders in a cheerful or welcoming manner, the small lady, asian/pacific islander looking, takes orders sounding like taking orders  as  obligatory  for her...without a smile.... Smiling wont cost the management anything right?"}
{"text":"I come in here a bunch, and always get a Kalbi Rib plate or a side of Kalbi Ribs with extra cabbage. I absolutely love this place. I get great quality of food (& a massive amount) that is inexpensive. The people working always seem to be in a great mood. If it's slow I tend to have great conversations with the cashiers while I hear the kitchen laughing. If ever I go in with a bad mood, I always leave with a smile. :]"}
{"text":"I used to eat here in high school..i graduated 2001..lets say ive been craving it ever since...theres NO Hawaiian restaurants in the tristate ny nj area....google maps says it'll take 35 hours to get there if i start now...thinking about it.. :)"}
{"text":"When you have lived in Hawaii, when you have experienced and understand the Aloha spirit and all that it contains you also will understand that food is important to the culture.   I can tell you stories about trips planned to infamous restaurants and eateries all over the islands based on lengthy conversations with many who live there.  Yes, good food is appreciated by the island folks.....so lets transition to Arizona where you can still find some folks from the islands.  As was the case there, the conversation quickly turns to great places to eat, and where to find that great island style food that we grew to love.  I was so excited to find that this place was good, and super close to where we live.  We have been there often since.  We have even used them to cater our oldest sons Hawaiian stlye Bday party last year.   Food is great, local style.   Just what the Dr. ordered.   A bit of Aloha in Arizona, cant get better than that."}
{"text":"I have been going to Aloha Kitchen for years, both this one and the one on Maryland Parkway and Tropicana. They always have excellent service, a clean dining area and great tasting food!
I recommend the adobo fried rice omelet and he BBQ chicken plate, my two favorite dishes that I can order time and time again and still love like it was the first time eating them.
There's minor things I could complain about, but really, Aloha Kitchen has done so well over the years to provide such good food and customer service that I keep coming back. Mahalo!"}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for a while, finally managed to get there before they close which is 8. Really good food. More like traditional Hawaiian food rather than these Hawaiian BBQ places around town. The beef was really good, a little salty but the rice and mac salad takes care of that. The coconut shrimp was excellent too. Portions were pretty large, even the small size would be good enough for me. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Had the shrimp and teriyaki chicken special. OMG it was good. Everyone was very nice and friendly. Dan had the rib special. It was awesome also."}
{"text":"I am sorry but this place is so good. It is super large inside and the staff is always friendly/helpful. My fav is the bento box, it is about $8. They also have student deals and a water cooler with glasses next to the counter if you do not want soda. Cool and relaxing place."}
{"text":"I really had high expectation for this place or maybe i Just didn't order the right thing.

Pro's:
-Friendly
-Parking
-Quick

Con:
Adobo fried rice was lacking that adobo flavor, or maybe it was just for that day?"}
{"text":"They are disorganized. If you dont wait right in front of them they will skip you over and make you wait an hour. Food is average. Gold Hawaiian has EXTREMELY better food and customer service."}
{"text":"Still the ONLY Hawaiian food place that sits well with me.  They are amazing over at Aloha.  Really nice people as well.  Wish they would deliver!!!"}
{"text":"Yummy!! The staff is always super nice and the food is delicious and cheap. Love the teriyaki chicken and shrimp"}
{"text":"We've been in Arizona for over 3 years, and when my husband and I need a taste of home (which is often!) we head to Aloha Kitchen. The owner is a local boy born and raised in Hawaii, and he had it down. The hubby and the daughter always get a saimin (noodles in soup) each, then we get Manapua (a Chinese steamed bun with pork), fried won tons, and then we each get a plate. My new favorite is the JR Special. It's fried chicken with the spicy-teriyaki wing sauce. Ummm. Husband gets the chicken katsu with bulgogi (thinly sliced BBQ beef). Yummy! They also have Aloha Maid drinks (which we grew up on!) and guava cake (which is amazing!). If you get the chance, go here."}
{"text":"This is the place for freshly prepared, ono, local Hawaiian style fast food.  Pricey for what you get, but it's fresh and authentic (it's not non-hawaiians \"trying\" to make hawaiian style fast food)."}
{"text":"Being from Hawaii, I've been looking for a good plate lunch place in Arizona.  I FINALLY FOUND IT!  Aloha Kitchen gets an A+.  The owner, Ray, is a really cool relaxed dude and all the aunties in the back are from Hawaii.

Very authentic Hawaiian style food.  All the classics from the islands within a 10 minute drive from my apartment!  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I had ordered the bolgogi beef :)  To be honest it tasted somewhat like soy sauce or something similar.. maybe teriyaki..  I like my bolgogi with a sweet ginger flavor and a great sauce.  However it was still good and Ill be back again!

Try the tea with your meal..  yum.

I wish they had kalbi short ribs!  If they do at some point I would be a regular.  

Would have been 4 stars if everything wasnt served on styrafoam. :)  And please put more mac salad on the plate."}
{"text":"I love this place! I can get the same thing every time and never get tired of it. Their food is quite cheap and I love their Lumpia!"}
{"text":"Im realizing I have a total thing for Hawaiian food.  I wonder if its because most of my friends are Filipino and Japanese?  I was introduced to this place a couple of Vegas trips ago and now its a requirement that we eat there before we leave Vegas.  Adobo Fried Rice Omlette!  Never heard of it?  Me neither.  I think this is the only place in existence that thought of the magical idea.  
Im assuming the low ratings are due to people ordering less impressive dishes on the menu but you really cant judge a place by its worst dish.  Thats like going to a Seafood joint and giving them a low rating because you're the idiot that got the chicken. True you have to curtail your expectations a little when entering this place because it aint no Lawry's but on a level playing field, this spot has a few unique charming dishes that make we want to come back.  Its cheap, the tables arent too sticky and Im always in a state of shame due to overstuffing myself."}
{"text":"I have been eating @ Aloha Kitchen since it opened. I worked right next door at Nello's. I was very excited when Ray opened his doors. I could only hope the food was as good as I remember when I lived in on the Islands, and it was. 

I have been going here ever since. Especially since they offer Manapua. You have to try it. (Steamed buns, stuffed with pork)

Most other Hawaiian food places don't offer them and if you ever lived in Hawaii, particularly Oahu, you know what Manapua are and know what they should taste like. 

The only thing I wish they had added to the menu, over all these years is \"Pork Hash\", Mmmmm I miss those."}
{"text":"I had the teriyaki beef bowl and was very pleased with the sauce, vegetables and rice. I also had their spam musubi and loved it. Their sauce is sweet and flavorful. I will keep coming back."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I usually get the chicken teriyaki, which is really good.  But lately, I have been ordering the Chinese chicken salad ( hold the oranges) .  I get an extra container of dressing, and it makes the salad great.  It's a full meal for a warm evening when you don't want to cook."}
{"text":"I greatly enjoy their chicken Katsu and Bulgogi mix plate.  And their manapua is great as well (I always order two and give one away to whomever's with me).  I've been several times over the last year and have yet to be disappointed.  

One late Wednesday night we walked in on the surreal scene of ukulele lessons.  There was a veritable sea of ukelele enthusiasts from the Mesa area filling the left half of the restaurant, and between instruction some nice live music."}
{"text":"The food was very reasonably priced. They service was overall good. The ribs were very tasty and the they had a smooth sauce that I poured over my rice. I tried to go ahead and makes some changes to my order though and they weren't very accomodating."}
{"text":"Good food. Clean favility. Nice staff. 

Richard E. is soooooooooo effin' gorgeous! I wanted to order a side of him to go. Total eye candy... didnt need a dessert after seeing him. LOL"}
{"text":"I love this place! We always have to eat here whenever we go to Vegas! I recommend the adobo fried rice!!"}
{"text":"It's not just great Hawaiian food, it's just great food. Period. Everything is so fresh and authentic with lots of the specialty ingredients flown in from Hawaii. There's a reason this place has been here for 28 years!"}
{"text":"I ordered tapsilog - it was so raw and rubbery. If you're afraid to cook tapsilog the way it's supposed to be cooked - take it off the menu. You  have no business with it. The meat was tough even after I asked the fry chef to recook it and the eggs were old. I asked who the manager was and the cashier did not know who it was. Imagine that. Disappointed because I go to all the other kitchens and have great food .. grand opening ?? Better close it down ."}
{"text":"This is the best Hawaiian food I have had in Arizona.  We usually go once a week to pick up dinner after work, usually ordering to go.  I have only had to wait for my food once, but the whole restaurant was packed on a Saturday for dinner.  We will continue to eat at Aloha Kitchen for every Hawaiian meal we need."}
{"text":"Good food, decent prices, and pretty casual. Best of all, they have a ton of space so groups are fine and they are never packed."}
{"text":"I am born and raised in hawaii, and when im not visiting home(oahu) i go to aloha kitchen for my hawaiian food ,with local portions and alot of aloha spirit its like im at home so when my family and friends come and visit me we always make a stop at aloha kitchen first ."}
{"text":"I have been going to aloha kitchen for 25 years now.  Wow all I can say is in all those years I don't have one complaint.  The food is amazing because all the food is prepared fresh not like Onos where they store buy their food.  So if you like store bought food you might as well go buy it yourself.   The staff are always friendly and make you feel welcome Everytime I go.   I am very upset when I see bad reviews to my favorite place    as far as the yelp menu i don't think people understand that it's not their fault it's wrong because it was put their by someone else who did it.  People you need to ask or do your research before you complain about the misleading information if you have enough time to write a complaint.  As far as the atmosphere it's a mama and papa place.  Do people not understand what that means.   It's not a fancy place that's why it's called that.  If you want a fancy restaurant go to a fancy restaurant or get off your lazy butt and cook yourself.   I don't put any pics up because I'm not a teenager.   I hate it when people complain about my favorite place to eat.   I don't understand why people listen to people's comments because everyone is different and like different things.  You can't please everyone.  Try it for yourself.  Get your own opinion"}
{"text":"Da best and ONOliscious island cuisine in this area.  We love the food and the great service..:"}
{"text":"Tried the mahi plate. TERRIBLE!!! It was wrapped in something like egg, and the fish itself was way overcooked. Also, it was so bland!

Not impressed with the rice omelette, the adobo was shredded into tiny pieces. BBQ combo was ok, but the chatsu was super sweet."}
{"text":"We've been craving some authentic island food for weeks and knew Ono's Hawaiian BBQ would just not satisfy it! We ordered the Hawaiian Combo and Saimen and it was just like eating with the ohana!! The laulau, kalua pork, long rice-- all Ono!! Can't wait to go back to get another fix!!"}
{"text":"Aloha Kitchen definitely satisfied my longest craving for local Hawaiian food.  Living on the East Coast does take a toll on the Local when it comes to food, and I knew that one of my biggest priorities when visiting Vegas was to find good Hawaiian grinds.

I found Aloha Kitchen on a random google search.  It was also the place of choice because it's about a 10-15 minute bus ride from the airport on the 109.  This is great for those of us who are cheap and like to save money by not renting a car and utilizing public transportation.  And, it literally drops you off right across the street.

The food selection was plentiful, so I had a really hard time deciding on something.  I ended up ordering a Hawaiian plate that included laulau, kalua pig, and the usual scoops of rice and ono mac salad.  In addition, I also ordered a couple of manapuas.  I tried to order poke, but they already ran out--and it was only noon!  You know when something runs out that quick, it has to be good.  Great for them, bad for me, I guess!  The funny thing is that I kept thinking \"you can't screw up laulau and kalua pig\", but then I had to remind of myself that you CAN.  It wasn't dry, too salty, or even mushy, which are sometimes an issue.  It was just like how it is back home in Hawai'i.

My partner had the katsu/curry plate really liked it.  Unfortunately, I was too much of a pig indulging in my meal to sample from his plate, so I personally can't attest to its goodness.  

Would I go back there again?  Absolutely!  Great location, great price, ono food--what else do you need?  Oh yes, the employees were very nice, too!"}
{"text":"Always get the same thing. J.R special, never disappointed. The potato mac is off the hook!"}
{"text":"Soooo good. I've been coming here for years, and all I ever order is the local plate, which is kahlua pig with cabbage and chicken Katsu, along with rice and macaroni salad. All you need is a Hawaiian Sun drink, which they have, and you can just picture hearing the waves!"}
{"text":"Food is good, but we literally waited 30 mins for adobo fried rice omelette to come to our table!!"}
{"text":"Good food & service, however floors and booth seats need to cleaned on a regular"}
{"text":"First time there and the food was good. Not crowded which I liked. Fast device and large portions."}
{"text":"Ate there for lunch with the family. We had the teriyaki combo, the bento teriyaki, and the Loco moco. All was good but I thought they went a little over board in the teriyaki sauce. Other than that, the did was good."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Love the teriyaki chicken and sweet and sour chicken. Everyone in there is always so nice."}
{"text":"My friends and I had lunch here today.  It was exactly what other Yelpers described... Nothing fancy about the decor but the food was good and the staff extremely nice and helpful. We ordered wontons as an app and should have gotten 2 orders.  Entrees were Bulkogi, which was tender and flavorful, JRs chicken, similar to a spicy sesame chicken, teriyaki chicken, no surprises and chicken katsu, sauce was good but don't fry it in the same oil as the fish items.
We all decided it was worth coming back and would be even more excited if they delivered!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for a quick bite on our way through Vegas.. didn't want a burger or Mexican food and found this little spot which turned out to be very good! Had a teriyaki chicken and teriyaki beef bowl: both we excellent and very reasonably priced! To top off the delicious meal, we became acquainted with Neal, the Big Kahuna at this location. Extremely friendly and service oriented, I highly recommend stopping in for a bite to eat. Mahalo!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I tried the Local Plate and it was delightful! They have a variety of dishes, really feeling and affordable. Can't go wrong with the mac salad, it was delicious! The ambience was nice and relaxing. A great place to stop by with your friends. The staff was really nice and knew the menu. I wish there was one in SoCal."}
{"text":"Long overdue review.  I've been coming here for over 9 years.   The food is great.  Recently they repainted their walls, added a nice touch to remind you of their Aloha spirit.  We try to come here early on Saturdays when they have their laulau plate and poke.  There's always a line and sometimes nowhere to sit on that one day of the week.  

But I haven't been disappointed yet.  If they're out of laulau, their bbq chicken and bulgogi is just as ono/yummy."}
{"text":"Off Off the hook. Real good food. Everything I have ate here is up to par. I suggest the adobo fried rice omelet.  It's It's so good I forget it's 110 degrees outside ! !!"}
{"text":"We've been coming here twice or once a month or depending when my kids wish too.. though we usually have great decent food and great service, I simply do not understand what is wrong when it comes to napkins... how come they don't give enough??? There is a difference between frugal and being morally and ethically cheap and they definitely are the cheapest of all!!! Hello?! Please give us napkins!!!!! 

The second thing would be the cheap Styrofoam cups which are too fragile.. other than that we like it here and it breaks my heart seeing that they don't even care or take the step about improving. Please management. It's quite embarrassing Pinoy talaga.."}
{"text":"This place is not too bad; haven't tried many Hawaiian food places while I've been here except for the marketplace cafe in the California hotel, and the lnl on S. Maryland. Out of all three, this was prob the furthest from tasting like the food from back home. I got the local plate which consisted of 2 spam musubis, Mac salad, and Teri chxn/beef.

Musubis: they were okay, but nori and spam were quite soggy prob due to the over use of Teri sauce

Mac salad: not that great..lacked flavor and had a salty base..texture of noodles were nice and firm though! 

Teri chicken: usually Teri chxn is bbq'd or something..but idk, the one from here was fried (I'm guessing) which I found interesting, and it was covered with gooey overpowering Teri sauce, which was extra sweet and salty  

Teri beef: same as the chicken in terms of that gooey overpowering Teri sauce..the texture of the beef was good though 

Overall this place was literally not bad nor was it good. Lol. I mean nothing can compare to food back home, but honestly I would prob goto lnl or the California for better stuff !"}
{"text":"Fantastic and authentic food from a local small business. Good stuff, worth trying; worth repeating. Very reasonable prices as well!"}
{"text":"Since I live in Georgia, I have to get my Hawaii food fix whenever I'm in Las Vegas. This place did not disappoint. Had the adobo fried rice, yummy!! Great food and great service. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I gave this a fair review because it is not the place or the food that is bad, it is me. The food was just wayyy to much for me and I felt really sick after i ate it. I guess it just doesn't sit well with my stomach. Now don't get me wrong the food was BOMB, but I don't care to ever go back there!"}
{"text":"Classic Hawaiian food. Teriyaki chicken student special comes with a drink a lots of rice for under five bucks."}
{"text":"Just ordered Laulau the worst ever, I opened it to find 1 piece of meat the size of a table spoon that's it the rest was luau leaf.  My grand daughter ordered saimin and a group of 10 came in 10 min after us. They got their food before she did. I asked the girl why did they get their food first?  She said because we bring it out when it's done.  She's still waiting for her saimin.  They need to go to Ross J's or 808 Plate to learn how to make luau luau."}
{"text":"Horrible, just horrible. The one closer to my house is muuch better. (Charleston and Lamb) 
I was there at around 6:30 on a Wednesday, and i was the only person in the place. It does have cute decor- it's all bamboo'ed out and has tropical plants everywhere.
 I ordered 2 different combo plates to go from the snotty guy at the register, and the  food was ready pretty quickly. But it was really disappointing. The chicken Katsu was the best part, but how do you mess that up,right? 
The teri chicken was very funky and gross (i was worried that it was going bad,it was so funky), and the pork-with-cabbage (i forget what it's called) was weird too. that is usually our favorite, so i was pretty sad. The worst part? My macaroni salad was in teeny little styrofoam cups (What!) and was soo gross.
 I will never go to this Aloha again!"}
{"text":"Whenever I am craving Kalbi ribs, I go here. It's right next to UNLV and a great alternative to the fast food burger joints that saturate the area. I usually call in an order and pick it up on my way home, which is very convenient and very quick: 10 min at the most. Everyone is very friendly and the restaurant is simple and clean.

I have heard the adobo friend rice omelet is awesome. I still have yet to try it. But I trust the hype. How can you go wrong with adobo and fried rice?? 

Oh, don't forget to look out for the specials and UNLV student discounts. They also sell delicious Hawaiian Sun drinks to quench your thirst. Yum!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Hawaiian restaurant! I love the teriyaki chicken, chicken katsu, fish, macaroni salad, saimin, musubi... just everything!"}
{"text":"I don't know what all the fuss is about this place. The beef bulkgogi was dry and salty. The manapua was very flavorful and soft but the only thing that saved the meal was the saimin, it was unbelievable. Otherwise this place maybe gets two stars. I was there on a Wed. night around dinnertime it was packed! This was my  first time here. I don't know if I will be back, maybe if I lived closer, or maybe when I get cravings for saimin."}
{"text":"Do you like any of the below?

(a) rice
(b) adobo
(c) eggs
(d) feeling full

If you picked any of the letters above, adobo fried rice is a must."}
{"text":"I'm giving this restaurant 3 stars based of a few things.  Had this food not tasted so good, it would have gotten 2 stars.  

What I ordered: Tapsilog (beef, rice, and 2 eggs)
How it tasted: delicious! So good, it made me miss home.

Issues:  The portions were really not what I expected.  I ordered it to-go, so it came in a styrofoam container.  There was SO much rice that it filled the whole bottom of the container and they gave me about 7-8 TINY pieces of tapa.  I ordered my eggs over-easy and when I opened my container, the eggs were broken and yolk was everywhere.

Would I come here again?  Maybe not this particular location, but I would order from Aloha Kitchen again.  Expect an update on this review from another location."}
{"text":"Love it! That's all I can say, been coming here for years sorry no pictures since  I'm usually so hungry I don't get a chance to take a picture"}
{"text":"I went to Aloha Kitchen with my boyfriend on a Monday morning because we wanted it to be our last stop before we head back to LA. This is our normal routine when we close out an awesome Vegas trip. 
When we arrived, there was one party waiting for their to go orders, and one person waiting for his food to dine in, so we figured that our food shouldn't take long. I ordered my loco moco with over easy egg, and my boyfriend ordered an adobo omelette. 
We sat down at 10:10 and waited for our food. At 10:40 the loco moco finally came out (it's an egg on top of a hamburger meat on top of white rice all topped with gravy). At 10:50, my boyfriend wanted to check on his order, he said \"Can I follow up on my order, it's been 40 minutes?\", and the server says with a hint of sass, \"You're order is being made, I'm still waiting on other orders\". Finally after 10 more minutes of waiting, the server drops off (more like slams) his food on the table and says, \"sorry about that\" (sarcastically) and walks away without giving him any utensils to eat with. 
He eats two bites because he lost his appetite, and I go grab a to go box. What i see is a bunch of people waiting for their to go orders, tables of people with no food on the table, a long line of people waiting to order, and all the servers turned their back on them talking to the cooks looking flustered. 
Aloha Kitchen, I understand being backed up in the kitchen, may I suggest some sort of appetizer (chips and dip) while customers wait, or more sympathetic servers. 
The food was okay, I think the service puts a damper on the actual eating experience 

Not a great way to end a Vegas trip, but I do suggest Kung Fu Tea if you love great boba and great service."}
{"text":"If it wasn't 110 degrees outside i wouldn't know I was in Arizona. This place reminded me exactly of a spot I went to in Honolulu. Food was perfect, atmosphere is laid back as expected, and the price was on par with the experience."}
{"text":"Great Hawaiian food at a great price! Love coming here and ordering the student special never fails to disappoint me!"}
{"text":"My friends and I dropped by Aloha Kitchen for lunch to try the infamous adobo fried rice omelette before leaving Vegas on Sunday. The 4 of us ordered 3 adobo fried rice omelettes (my boyfriend and I shared one). We didn't realize how huge they were! We were trying to imagine how good the omelettes would taste if we were drunk late at night. We all didn't finish ours and ended up getting boxes to go. 

My boyfriend and I also ordered the adobo katsu combo plate. The chicken katsu was great, very light (the way it should be). It seems like the adobo was slow-cooked. The meat was very tender and full of flavor. I can't wait to go back and try out some of their other menu items. I also can't help but also be curious about how the other Aloha Kitchen locations measure up.

Watch out: Don't even try to take a cab out here because you'll have to take a bus back to the strip."}
{"text":"Aloha Kitchen is one of my go to spots for local Hawaii food.  I used to come here once in awhile just to get that Hawaii flavor.  

But now I come here often for the OXTAIL SOUP.  Buggah is winnahs.  The soup is very tasteful, lots of ginger.  The rest of the menu is good too.

Service and customer service is above average.  The restaurant is always clean when I'm here."}
{"text":"adobo fried rice, yes, please!  okay, maybe it's not the best adobo in the world, but it feeds the filipino in me and makes me long to be in hawaii all at once.  and hell, they have spam and corned beef on the menu!  feels like home...w/o having to do the dishes."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Came in during a break from class by myself. Was greeted, very polite! Had the locomoco, it was great!"}
{"text":"Everything I had was unimpressive and bland. Adobo fried rice omlet was ugh. Mahi was meh. Shrimps were shrimps. Scallops were half battered and over fried. They looked like machine cogs. Hard and hideous. Inedible. I uploaded a picture of them - two of them sitting on a styrofoam lid. Check them out for yourself. No good folks. No good."}
{"text":"Great Kalbi plate!!!! These short ribs are marinated well. Awesome flavor. The Teriyaki plates are pretty good too,  the sauce needs a little sweetness, I think. The macaroni salad is the bomb. I like this place, good food for a good price. I tried the chicken wings...not worth it.  The appetizers are not that good and cost almost as much as a plate. Stick to the combination plates."}
{"text":"great service and great tasting food. try the garlic chicken with gravy, tapsilog, chicken bbq and stir fry vegetables with chicken. also the banana pancake with the vanilla cream is highly recommended."}
{"text":"We had a party of 14 people and they were able to accommodate. Food came out quickly and everything was so tasty! I tried the mixed combo, loco moco, sesame chicken salad. Our group ordered a ton of food - chicken adobo, Pork adobo, curry dishes, kalbi plate, adobo fried rice omelette, just to name a few. The adobo fried rice omelette was the group favorite. Will definitely come back the next time we are in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This place was great. I had the chicken salad. And it I enjoyed it. The place is clean and the worker are friendly. Thanks aloha kitchen"}
{"text":"I get the coconut shrimp with teriyaki chicken every time and it never disappoints. The service is great as well."}
{"text":"I've only ever been to the aloha kitchen near UNLV. The quality of food is so much better than previous times I've had it. 
I had the chicken katsu plate. It was great. Everything was delicious and the portion size was plenty. Im never a huge fan of mac salad anywhere. It is actually very rare that i eat it but if thats something that you enjoy then you get a solid scoop of it on the side. 

most of the time at aloha kitchen i enjoy the student special, its a five dollar, ( actually a little less, 4.96!) chicken teriyaki and rice bowl with a cup for a fountain drink. i think that is one of the best deals for food that you could possibly come by. especially for a broke college student, that is one heck of a special. And the quality of their chicken has definitely upgraded recently and i for one appreciate it greatly."}
{"text":"Excellent Lunch of Coconut shrimp & tempura chicken was more than enough for two seniors. They don't take reservations but do allow BYO. Their great rating on Check Please was right on!"}
{"text":"I've been going here for about 10 years now.  Every once in a while I used to forget that they were closed on Mondays, but now I remember.
I always order the mixed plate #4 with potato mac salad and leave stuffed and satisfied.  It has always been excellent.

The place has a unusual feel since it's kind of a strip mall setup and not that easy to spot, but when you are there it's like everyone knows that they are in on the secret."}
{"text":"This is probably my least favorite location thus far. I grew up eating at a Aloha Kitchen and I was super excited to see one open near me, however, I was disappointed that it's not as good as the other locations. They just opened recently so I do expect change for the better. Currently this place is just the restaurant, but soon there will be a bar and gaming.

My favorite thing about this place is that the food is fresh. Everything is made to order. I love coming here for all things Spam. Their spam musubi, their spam saimin soup, and especially their spam and eggs for breakfast. Their adobo fried rice is good choice if you'd like a big order. It is fried rice wrapped in eggs. Their salad isn't great, they use cheap lettuce so it's tasteless. Their macaroni is really good, I love to add it to my orde if they don't already come with it. Their lumpia is decent if you're craving it, but it can be over fried sometimes.

Their staff is friendly and they really pay attention to their customer's needs. I have to critique this place because they are new and I hope they can improve. Their food portions are very inconsistent. One day their is too much food for me to finish by myself and other days, there is literally nothing on my plate.  I love their recipes, but I think they need to uphold the standard that the other locations have left. Quality of cooking needs to be improved. I will be gladly returning to hope they take note of their customers demand."}
{"text":"The food is AWESOME!! I looooove the Manapua and the Bulkogi or however it's spelled. It's the best!! the mac-potato salad is worth the trip alone!! I'm so glad my friend made me try it because I always go back when I'm on that side of town!! OH! and the fried wonton appetizers are the best too!! I love the sauce it comes with!! ALOHA!! :D"}
{"text":"Seems a little pricey for the menu or the amount of food you do get with the order but the food is absolutely Amazing!"}
{"text":"I've been here before and had relatively good experiences, but today these guys really dropped the ball.

My wife is in school at UNLV, and she has exactly one hour for lunch. I picked her up and took her to Aloha Kitchen. We were in line by 12:10, waiting to place our order. Plenny time for a great island lunch, yeah?

No.

It took the counter guy 10 minutes to take care of the one person in front of me. Half of that time he was standing with his back to the register, waiting. Finally took our order at 12:20. Still plenny time, yeah?

We waited. And waited. And waited. I got up and asked whether they'd forgotten us. The counter guy assured me our food was \"next.\" Waited some more. A very polite busboy asked how long we'd been waiting. We told him almost half an hour. He checked, and told us our food was \"next.\"

At 12:45 I got up again. My order number was 58, and I saw that people with 60 and 66 had received their food. I told the counter guy we needed to take our food to go, because we were out of time. He got pretty snippy with me, telling me I was \"next.\"

\"You've been saying that for half an hour.\"

\"Whatever.\"

Finally got our food at about 12:55. To go. Dry katsu, no sauce. Mac salad instead of the kimchi we ordered. Everything separate, so there was no rice in with the curry or kalua--it was in with the bone-dry katsu. My wife tried to eat some of it on her way back to school, but burned her tongue on it because it was so hot.

The food was pretty good. I ate the katsu while fantasizing about having sauce. The mac salad was good, even though it wasn't what I ordered. If I had a two-hour lunch hour, I might consider coming here again. But only if they get new help. Seriously--the service we received today was atrocious."}
{"text":"I came to Aloha Kitchen on two occasions.  The first was about 20 mins before they closed on a Saturday night.. Sadly the young man turned me away. He said that they have run out of food for the night, and that they were closing. No problem ill just have to come earlier next time. 
I called in an order about a week later, I asked for the most popular dish on the menu.  Bulkgori beef I think it was call (bad spelling sorry!) with a side of macaroni salad.. I also told him is like a side dish. I asked again what was the most popular- he replied another beef side and a few others but said sadly they had run out for the day. I settled for the fried wontons and sweet and sour. 
I arrive the chef had just put up my to go box in the window next to a plate for one of the guest that was dinning in. The guy at the counter opened and check the box and said something to chef about an order that wasn't right with the plate he had put up next to my box of food. He closed the box and left it in the window, waiting for the wontons. I paid and guy at the counter, he turned around and put the two boxes in a bag and handed them to me.. Oh BTW I had a 2 year old in tow on one of my hips. 
He handed me the bag and I left. For home and my order was wrong.. WTF
Thinking back I realized the guy at the counter was pointing out in fact my order had been switch with the food on the plate and he still gave me the plate.. No macaroni salad.. Just a plain soggy salad.. With a terrible ketchup dressing. The beef dish however was marinated in a very flavorful sauce. But defiantly not worth the 9 dollars for the dish.. Also had the wontons that were left in the deep drier to long.. They taste okay. I smothered then in the sweet an sour.. Ahh much better 
All and all I have these guys 3 stars. Probably will not come back.. But they have sparked my interest for Hawaiian food."}
{"text":"This place is the very essence of 2-stars.

The only attribute that could be awarded 3 stars would be the decor.

The plates were chipped, didn't feel clean. The food was mediocre. The service was anything but friendly.

I can think of no reason to go back, even for a cheap teriyaki bowl. I figure if the more expensive dishes are lacking, the cheap dishes will be downright frightful.

For lunch on a weekend it was nearly empty; two tables occupied in a sea of vacancy."}
{"text":"Meh. Quality of food was cheap, flavor was okay. Staff was friendly, but for the price it could have been much better."}
{"text":"This is definitely the worst location for food. I've eaten here numerous times it's always old food, yet I keep giving them a chance. The workers act like they don't want to be bothered and you are an inconvenience. Wouldn't recommend their food to anyone......."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat.  Literally everything is ridiculously good.  Favs are the Bulkogi, Salmon, Terriyaki Chicken, Mac Salad and the Island Wings.  Simple yet amazing food."}
{"text":"So good so fresh. Never tried Hawaiian kinda wanted something different and I got it. Plus the prices aren't bad at all. Be back next week to try something different."}
{"text":"I came to check out this place today.
It's in Henderson, close to Sunset Station casino. I was passing by, saw it, and decided to try this joint, as I have grown fond of Hawaiian food recently.

The restaurant is not small. It's a decent size and plenty of tables. The decor is nice, Hawaiian style and they play Hawaiian music too. Tables and floor looked clean.

I ordered the Aloha combo plate special. It comes with Teryaki chicken, katsu chicken and beef. It comes with rice and little cabbage. You also have a choice of a side of macaroni salad (why choose that, come on),  steamed vegetables or kim-chi (which is pickled and marinated cabbage). I chose the kim-chi and liked it. I liked all of the food. It was delicious. 

I also tried the fried banana desert, which is only a $1. That one was a lil weird for me, but I just wanted to try. I'm sure many people like it.

The customer service was very good. I asked the girl in the front some questions and she gladly explained everything. 

Overall I'm very happy with Aloha Kitchen and would recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"I reallyike the food the leaf they use for the pork is collard and the teriyaki chicken is bomb .. Nice flavor on the chicken, but it was a bit burnt.. I am coming back real soon"}
{"text":"Great food. Close to campus. Affordable prices. This place is the bomb dot com. I love the chicken katsu and fried saimin!!"}
{"text":"Just tried this for the first time. Good food and big portions. Food came out quickly. 
2 of my kids shared the teriyaki chicken and there was even left overs to take home. Will definitely try again."}
{"text":"The food is okay and the prices aren't bad, but I've gotten sick every time I ate here. Not exactly something I aim for when I go out to eat."}
{"text":"Another one of my recent Hawaiian food finds, this one, like many other Hawaiian restaurants around town, comes equipped with your standard foods and pleasant service (Why are Hawaiians so dang happy and friendly all the time? Clearly it's the food.).

There's two big differences about Aloha Kitchen that make it one of my preferred Hawaiian places:

1.) The inside is actually a really nice place to sit and enjoy a meal. You can take out if you want, but if you aren't in a rush, you can sit and relax a spell in a nice, clean, comfortable (albeit small) dining area, and enjoy your food at your own pace. Some Hawaiian places feel like they're being run out of a box, and that's fine when doing take-out or delivery, but sometimes you want to stay and enjoy the food right from the kitchen.

And

B.) There's something about the mahi-mahi here. It's amazeballs. Now, I'm not a big judge on authenticity, I've never been to Hawaii, I don't know how the locals make it, but I'm a big fan of their food and eye candy, and in both I know what tastes I like. (Heyooooo...) So while other places fry their mahi-mahi (and that's tasty, don't get me wrong, me and fried are best buddies), Aloha Kitchen uses, like, this egg batter, then kinda flash-fries it. It's hard to explain, but it's SO GOOD. You get the mahi-mahi, and you're like, \"Hey, Aloha Kitchen, you can't fool me! I ordered fish, not an omelete!\" It seriously looks like you ordered an omelete, but you bite in and it's delicious Hawaiian fish that's A-Mahi-Mahi-MAZING.

(\"A-Mahi-Mahi-MAZING\" trademark 2012 R. Bates, Inc.)

I seriously can't describe it any better than that. It just has to be tasted. So go taste some Aloha Kitchen. Then eat it, because just licking things is weird and probably unsanitary."}
{"text":"Adobo Rice Omelette, Spam Musubi, Mix Plate.  All on point.  No frills, Hawaiian restaurant just east of the Strip.  It's my second time to visit and will always come here when I visit Vegas.  There's tons on the menu I'd like to try next time, so I can't wait to visit again.

Tip: get some Spam Musubi to go!"}
{"text":"Use to live in Phoenix while going there for school and work.  Came back this past week and the food was great as usual.  I also brought a friend who's never tried Hawaiian food and loved the mac/potato salad, katsu bulgogi plate.  Keep up the great work guys and Mahalo."}
{"text":"I had better Hawaiian food in las Vegas. They have these combo plates but their menu doesn't say what's in it and when I asked the lady she seemed irritated when I asked what was in 2 different plates. Don't get me wrong the food was good but for the price I can go to island sushi or Ross j's for bigger portions."}
{"text":"Great food and plenty of it at a reasonable price. I come in several times a month and the staff is always friendly. This place is well worth the visit."}
{"text":"We stopped here for lunch this past Thursday, 1/25/18, on our way home from a trip to Arizona.  I was looking forward to having a bowl of saimin...must say I was not disappointed...it was a huge bowl and it was fantastic.  My husband had fried rice omelet with chicken...he was only able to eat half of it.  October 2016 we stopped at an Aloha Kitchen in Las Vegas on another trip to Arizona...the food at this Henderson location was much better...a bigger, nicer looking establishment."}
{"text":"Always hit and miss...and they are now charging extra for katsu sauce...really? I come for the food...not the sauce. I had the curry/katsu combo today...and it was awful. Last week it was the bomb...just don't know what more to say."}
{"text":"Moved from Hawaii about 4 yrs. ago. Missing the island flavor; I searched until I found a place that could serve up good and tasty Hawaiian style local food. I stumbled upon this place in Mesa. The people were so friendly there ! It made me feel like I was in the islands. I enjoyed the Hawaiian music/decor and hospitality. The bulgogi and fried saimin was so delicious ! My girlfriend and I wanted to order everything on the menu ! We had to have a piece of the chantilly cake too for our dessert. To top it off we recognized some local Hawaiian people who had moved from Hawaii to Arizona too ! We enjoyed the \"little peace of heaven\" and had leftovers to bring home for later.  :-)"}
{"text":"So another long overdue review

I've eaten at Aloha kitchen at least 6 times over the last three years.  It's a decent place - reasonable prices ( I've never spent more than $10 ) good service and the food is good - somewhat standard hawaiian fare so for me, since trying island flavor, i have to consider Aloha kitchen to be a cut below( i dig Island Flavor ! ) 

went with the terriyaki chicken plate - prefer to have two scoops of mac salad to the 2 scoop rice they give you ( and i asked for 2 mac instead of the rice ... oh well ) 

pic added."}
{"text":"Coming straight from Hawai'i this was our first local food place we ate and it was terrible. No seasoning on any of the food we had ordered. (2 loco mocos, 1 fried noodle, and 2 kalua pig and cabagge with chicken katsu combo) No rice came with our kalua pig. Not the biggest fan. Won't be eating here again."}
{"text":"Went with some friends who really like this place.  Maybe it's comfort food for them so they have some positive emotional associations I lack.  

Two stars for friendly service.  The food was slimy, poorly seasoned, and the ingredients were cheap.  Would not eat again."}
{"text":"First of all, bomb! We always come here when in Las Vegas. It gets tiring paying too much money for vegas buffets. This spot really reminds me of being back home in Hawaii. One main reason I come here is for of course, Adobo Omelette! I can finish the whole thing! The other menu items look good too, but my heart is with Adobo Omelette!!!!!! I tried the Spam Masubi. It was good, but I still love the Adobo Omelette!!!!!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent and quick. Food was yummy just like being back on the island.   We shared the Hawaiian Plate (Wed and Sat special) and the Ahi Poke. So many things to try we can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Foods okay. Service is better. 
Atmosphere is one of a fast food restaurant. If you're craving recent Hawaiian, this place will meet your needs but not exceed them. 

Also, mediocre macaroni salad."}
{"text":"I love Aloha Kitchen been going to them for years, so thinking this place would be the same I was wrong. First thing I noticed was the smell, Smelled like rotten eggs not just the first time but every time I go there. The food is the only thing that taste ok. Service is not the best but I can stand it for now."}
{"text":"I always get the local plate. The staff is super friendly, and the food is always great!"}
{"text":"Been looking forward to eating here since my husband said they have a Kahuku flag up \"so you know it's legit\" lol. I had the mix plate #2 and Hawaiian plate special. SO GOOD! Thank God we found a real hawaiian place to fuel my cravings cus no other place has been good and I've tried lots of places (i lived in Cali for 10yrs). I'm definitely coming back especially for that potato Mac! 

P.S. GO FARRINGTON GOVS! 
I'm from Kalihi hahaha"}
{"text":"I used to come here somewhat regularly but will never come back again. They served me with old spam in my spam musubi last night near closing time. I live about 20 minutes away. By the time I got home and started eating my food I noticed that the spam was old and crunchy. The beef teri was also old and tough. The only thing decent was the chicken and mac salad. It was already too late and too far away for me to get a refund or have them make me another local plate so I decided to save it until the next day. I couldn't stop by early enough on my way into work so it wasn't until later in the evening and I attempted to get at least another musubi and beef teri. I was told that it was already too late and I had already eaten the food. They could have at least given me another spam musubi."}
{"text":"Awesome always! Saimen salad, manapua - forgive the spellings but really Aloha Kitchen really brings on the Aloha spirit and fills you with breakjaw good eats every time. Check it out when you are looking for something really good that you can count on."}
{"text":"Only 4 stars because I gave Hawaiian Hale 5 stars, but this place is good eats too. I took a bite of my friend's Adobo Fried Rice, YUUM! Sometimes, the stew is good. And everything else is typical hawaiian, but definitely one of the best in LV."}
{"text":"Poor service, mediocre food, disorganized setup, not very clean. Won't go there again. 

We really didn't find this place appealing. When we walked in, it was not overly clear whether we were supposed to order and then sit or sit and have the waitress come to take our order... There was no menu actually posted - just a white board with some specials. It's not a very good place for people unfamiliar with Hawaiian food - and the staff wasn't particularly friendly to ask questions to. They were middling-busy when we went - there were a good number of tables filled but it wasn't slammed. We ended up standing at the counter while the cashier/order taker/whatever ignored us for a few minutes. There was confusion about their menu. The online menu in Yelp isn't overly accurate, by the way. Neither, apparently, is their printed menu. 

The food came out pretty quickly. The rice and the macaroni potato salad was pretty good. The chicken katsu was decent. Difficult to screw up steamed rice and breaded chicken, but I've seen it done before so props to them. The J.R. plate was tasty enough, according to my husband, but it left him with an upset stomach later. 

The cleanliness was the biggest concern. The table we sat at was dirty. The floor was smeared and filthy. The chair I sat in was sticky, and so was the counter where we ordered our food. I couldn't see into the kitchen but I was kind of wary about eating the food. 

I'm really not interested in going back, and neither are my husband or our friends that were with us. Find somewhere else to eat, save yourself the disappointment."}
{"text":"I eat at Aloha Kitchen roughly 2-3 times a week. I am a fan because the food is good, prepared in a timely fashion, the portions are nice and hearty, and the service is warm and friendly. (They even took the effort to remember my name and greet me by my name).

I would easily say that the quality and taste of their dishes surpasses that of L&L Hawaiian BBQ. 

They have a good atmosphere for dining, although I usually call in my order and take it to go. Staff is always friendly with me, which is a plus for me. 

They also have various filipino dishes, as well, which keeps it more interesting, IMO."}
{"text":"Great hawaiian food at a good price.  Best kalbi ribs I've had here in Vegas.  Another must try is their adobo fried rice.  Super yummy!  My kids love it! Portions are big too.  Clean place as well."}
{"text":"Had the combo bulgogi and chicken katsu plate... both were good as was the side of macaroni potato salad, but ... the bulgogi was WOW!!! F.L.A.V.O.R. ExPloSiOn!!!  Place was packed on Saturday for lunch even at past 2PM.  Best Hawaiian I've tasted  in Arizona."}
{"text":"Aloha Kitchen is... FANTASTIC! I had the chicken katsu combo plate. Comes with the chicken katsu, teriyaki chicken, two scoops of rice, and a YUMMO scoop of their potato mac salad. 

We also had the Manapua... really good! Its filled with bbq pork, and streamed. ***Be warned... it is wrapped on the bottom with a thin paper wrap, you would never know its there unless someone points it out or you do what I did... take a bite and realize you bit into something you shouldn't have. 

The restaurant itself lacks ambiance, and doesnt have outdoor seating. Place gets very busy. When I got there, (and had my order called in prior to arriving) I was the last person in line... which was outside. Moved fairly quick though. 

All in all... great experience."}
{"text":"I've been here the last 5 or 6 times I've been in town.  I always want to try something different.  But I can't seem to get away from the adobo fried rice omelet. The adobo is good and the egg is crepe thin.  It doesn't need ketchup, but I'm Filipino, so I put ketchup on it anyways. 

Stop by, try it.   And try some other stuff too and let me know!"}
{"text":"Very fast service! Portions are big too. We had the adobo omelet, Portuguese sausage and eggs, and spam masubi. The omelet could probably feed 2-3 people. Love it here and will be coming back."}
{"text":"Aww Damn! This place....how did this one get by me for so long. The food here is fantastic portions are huge and service is wonderful. Had the beef and teriyaki chicken combo and it was ..... There has to be a better word than delicious it was superb. Live on west side and this is one trip that's worth the drive. Definitely one of my new favorites, it's refreshing to see a mom and pop business succeed..... Awww Damn!"}
{"text":"Aloha Kitchen is a hole in the wall restaurant offering Hawaiian Filipino comfort food. Food is greasy and filling (isn't comfort food usually that?). This location is located in a strip mall with the university theater (doesn't look like they are currently in business) and a vape store. But don't let the run down area discourage you because the food here is wonderfully tasty and quite cheap. 

Anyways, my husband and I stopped by here this past Saturday evening around 8:25 pm and made a to go order. This place was nearly empty with the exception of 2 small tables. While we waited for our order to be made, we saw a handful of people come in to pick u their to go orders. We only waited maybe 15 minutes. This is what we ordered:

Mahi Mahi & Katsu Combination Plate, $7.99 prior to tax- The katsu served is chicken. This combination meal comes with 2 large pieces of Mahi Mahi (white fish) and many tender pieces of chicken katsu. Also included is 2 scoops of white rice and a small side of macaroni salad, which was good and creamy. I didn't like Mahi Mahi that much because it was bland. It was coated in egg and fried. I think there should be added seasoning to this (but the tartar sauce, on the side, that comes with the fish helped). With the generous portions, this meal was made into two. 

Mix Plate, $7.99 prior to tax- This combination plate comes with Mahi Mahi, teriyaki beef & teriyaki chicken (2 scoops of rice and macaroni salad too). My husband was not a fan of the fish as well and agreed that it was rather bland. Both the chicken and beef were good but it would have been nice to have the chicken or the beef cooked differently (maybe swap out the teriyaki chicken for chicken katsu or something) to really give more variety to this meal. My husband (I had a few bites) ate this whole meal and felt pretty full afterwards. Just like the portions of my meal, this was pretty large as well (which could have made for 2 meals too). 
---------------------------
(Total= $17.27, includes tax)


After we placed our order at the register, immediately the cook in the back got to work with our food (love that it was made to order and not just waiting around, ready to scoop into a styrofoam to go box). They also have sriracha available if you want some with your to go order (just have to ask for hot sauce, which is the famous brand, Huy Fong, in case you wanted to know.. not that it matters to me because I don't like spicy foods). 

Wait time for our food wasn't too long and food was pretty good. It was pretty cheap and filling. We will definitely make sure to stop here again the next time we visit Las Vegas. 

By the way, there is free (unprotected) WiFi and they do not take anything larger than a $20 bill (they also take credit card if you didn't bring cash)."}
{"text":"The food here is good for the price! My go to's are the Kalbi plate ($9.99), Kalua pig with cabbage ($7.99), or the Kalbi combo ($11.99). All have flavorful meats and give a good portion; and the combo I can usually separate into two meals. It's a quick restaurant when you aren't in the mood to cook dinner and they have multiple locations."}
{"text":"Freezer burnt lumpia, nasty Mac salad, I was so disappointed after a 20 minute wait for my food. Surely if they were going to throw everything in the microwave it should have been faster considering there was no other customers there. Booooo!"}
{"text":"The one and only reason I am giving Aloha kitchen two stars is based on the service I received last night. My Bestie and I walk in around 5:45 pm and wait about 5 minutes in line to place my order. No biggie. It was pretty busy in there. I place my order of Two Saimen soups, Loco moco and lumpia at 5:50 pm.   My bestie places her order of a Mixed plate right after me. As we sit down and wait at a table my Bestie gets informed that they were out of beef for the day. So she negotiates an alternative and we proceed to wait. As we wait a couple orders a wonton soup and combo plate and they sit down. More people are served thru the line when about 6pm a large family comes in that knows one of the cashiers and places an order. In their order there were two Saimen soups, a wonton soup and a Loco moco. Guess who gets their food first? Yep not me or the couple after us. My bestie received her food, and the couple received their combo plate but we had to wait for them to serve their \"friends\" first before we got our soups. The couple complains to the cashier around 6:20 by this time they have been waiting 25 minutes and we have been waiting 30. They get the manager on the phone who offers them a refund but the cashier can't do it because it was on a card... in all this we are still waiting for our soups. She finally gets my order ready places it on the counter... It sits there. I have to go up to her and ask her if that is my order. She gives me a sacastic yes. When I told her that I have been wait for over 40 minutes she barked an apology and said there is nothing else she can do. When we pointed out that the large family that was almost done with their meal got served before us with the same food she said again \"all I can say is sorry, nothing else I can do.\" For the record when we finally got home the order was wrong. I got one Saimen soup and one wonton soup. She gave me the soup the other lady was waiting for."}
{"text":"Honestly some of the best food around...staff is always very pleasant and helpful. Lots of food and prepared quickly. Very solid establishment! Makes me happy just walking thru the door!"}
{"text":"BOMB. 

I ordered the kalbi ribs, and my friend got the adobo fried rice omelette. Both were really great dishes. Plates are share-able because portions are so huge."}
{"text":"I work in the area and there's a really good Hawaiian BBQ place nearby. I discovered this place by people in my building were talking about this place, so I wanted to give it a try. Well, I'm glad I did. This place is excellent. Friendly staff, mom and pa operation.  Outstanding food. They have variety of mixed plates, soups, and great salads. I always get mixed places, they consist of Katsu or teriyaki chicken or their beef. Macaroni is good and you get two scoops of rice. Great lunch spot, check it out."}
{"text":"Aloha Kitchen is Mesa's best kept secret.  I've been coming here since I was a toddler (so about 20 years! !) It's my favorite food in the world, literally better than anywhere else. I always get the teriyaki chicken plate with the potato mac with a manapua, yum!"}
{"text":"When we go to Aloha kitchen, we usually share the platter (Luau Plate) - that has lomi lomi salmon, chicken long rice (clear glass noodles that have a strong ginger flavor), kalua pork, lau lau (optional), and some rice. I usually don't like the clear glass noodles because they often have no flavor, but the strong ginger flavor infuses the clear glass noodles with a discernible flavor. The lau lau is pork wrapped in a lau lau leaf - the meat comes out soft and tender. The lomi lomi salmon often doesn't have a lot of salmon in it. I think customers might get confused when they order this, because they are expecting to have more salmon than one or two dime sized pieces. I had their haupia (coconut dessert) once, I really liked it, but they only serve it sporadically so I haven't been able to try it again. The restaurant is a bit small and crowded because it is so popular.  The mixed plates are also delicious."}
{"text":"I've been going to Aloha on Charleston & Lamb and always get the Kalbi Combo! Over the years it's changed and it feels like it's getting more expensive but the portions keep getting smaller. The rice sometimes feels like it's old but other than that it's a great place and good customer service!"}
{"text":"No as good as the first one i bee  to on decatur but they have a good gravy on the loco mocos!"}
{"text":"Thirty years of doing business and they've got it DOWN! Good food that may be different than you've seen other places. If you like Hawaiian you will love Aloha. Got spam? A recent remodel is done and looks great and still preserved the previous feel... just nicer. Service is always with a smile and consistent between trips. Truly a family establishment with homemade dishes, sauces and even potato-mac... Oh you HAVE TO try the potato-mac! So good! Hawaiian comfort food at its finest."}
{"text":"We tried this today and the chicken is over cooked and not flavorful. The sauce isn't sweet at all. It's bitter and taste like A1. The macaroni salad was good."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised! I ordered a chicken teriyaki plate and a chicken katsu plate to go. When I got home and opened the boxes it looked like they weren't gonna be all that great but I was wrong. They taste soooo good!!! I'm glad I found this spot since I'm new to Henderson."}
{"text":"This restaurant is an awesome family owned business. Many people I work with frequent here regularly. They have multiple meat choices all of which are good.  There's enough food to share with someone, huge servings!"}
{"text":"So I got off work really later after 2 am and I needed some food.  The doors were closed but this place is open 24 hours.  But there was this retard mopping the floor and he knew I was trying to come in but he did nothing about it but continuously mopping the floor.   He clearly wanted no business so I took my business somewhere else.  Bad customer service and I will not come back.  And that fucking scrub  can mop the floor all day without getting any business"}
{"text":"The only place besides the L&L that closed down in Mesa that I have found saimin (haven't been to Happy Valley L&L).  Unfortunately, sometimes the broth is WAY too salty (like inedible, makes you sick to your stomach salty) and the filling on their wonton is too \"crunchy\" when soft in the saimin (Water chestnuts inside?  The filling texture is fine when they're fried...)

The fried wonton are tasty and the spam musubi are delicious.  They seem to run out of musubi fast some days though.  Even with their specials, their menu is very limited, so don't expect anything similar to Rainbow's or even L&L.

When I last came in they had done a refurbish/redecoration on the interior and spruced up the walls.  If looks better than what they had before.

Definitely a step above the likes of Ono Hawaiian Barbecue.  If only it wasn't so far from me now!"}
{"text":"Didn't care for the teriyaki chicken plate. Having lived in Hawai'i for 12 years I know what it should taste like for the most part.  The chicken tasted like a combination between pork rinds and some kind of other meat. The chicken was overcooked and had way too much teriyaki sauce on it. The mixed vegetables was all mostly cabbage. If you want some good teriyaki chicken I suggest Ross J's Hawaiian or hell even Teriyaki Madness."}
{"text":"Aloha kitchen use to be one of my favorite fast food joints. Unfortunately in the past year it has taken a downward spiral. The service is terrible the food is mediocre. I live close to this location and have tried multiple times to grab something to go. They ALWAYS close early. The sign on the door says 10 or 10:30, so why are they closed at 9pm?  Today I attempted to purchase a seaweed salad. I was super hungry waiting for my boyfriends dentist appointment to finish. I walked on over to Aloha and waited about 5 minutes for someone to come to the counter. My total came to $4 and some change. I pulled out my card ( i never carry cash) and the woman told me I need to have a minimum of $5 to use my card. I mean really?? Yes I could have purchased something to drink but it was the principle of the thing. So i just said never mind and walked out. No apology no nothing! horrible will never return"}
{"text":"One of the best places to get Hawaiian food in Vegas.
My favorite dish is the Adobo Omelette. I always try to stop by when I am visiting Vegas."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to visit when I come to Vegas. 
Adobo fried  rice omelet is what I suggest. 
The rest of the menu is good too!"}
{"text":"It looked vacant but as I opened the door the aroma quickly hit me . i had the teriyaki beef and sum lumpia , both were good !! although i had sum of my co workers beef (which is what brought me here) from the one off of Sunset i believe and it was tastier . lumpia were small i must say but i think they give u approx. 6 so not bad for the price but my lumpia put theirs to shame . the beef over a bed of rice made it feeling . nice meal for a decent price a +"}
{"text":"I'm Born and raised in Hawai`i and this quaint little fast food &/ casual sit in restaurant can definitely cure my local cravings! Walking in, your order at a counter and seat yourself. When your food's ready they bring it to you at your table. The staff is always friendly and helpful.  I've been here on multiple occasions and tried various meals; the taste and quality of the food is superb and can't say that I have a particular favorite.  I've only wished that my stomach was large enough to enjoy all the dishes in one sitting! 

I've had the Bulgogi and chicken katsu kixed plate, Fried Saimin, Hawaiian plate special (kalua pig with cabbage, Lomi Salmon and Chicken Long Rice), Ahi Poke', and Char Sui Won Ton Saimin, and always take home 2 char sui manapuas for later; all of these have met and exceeded my expectations. 


While the decor and ambiance is simple and nothing fancy, the quality of their food is amazing and customer service exemplifies the aloha spirit; this quaint and simple restaurant reminds me of home.  For that I've become one of the regulars at Aloha Kitchen."}
{"text":"Great food, excellent service! Took my daughter and her friends here to try katsu chicken and the potato macaroni salad. They loved it! Mahalo, Aloha Kitchen!"}
{"text":"Great Place to eat while in Vegas! Wholesome food and awesome vibes! \"Adobe Fried Rice Omelette\" delicious!"}
{"text":"Aloha Kitchen is relatively easy to find, just look for Sunset Station and it's right off on Sunset Road next to Rubio's. When entering the restaurant, every person gets an \"Aloha\" greeting. You walk to the counter, order your food, and they ask if you want Sriracha or Tobasco sauce. Then you fill your drink, find a place to sit, and wait for your meal. The restaurant is clean, the interior décor is bright and tropical, and the environment is design to bring out the islander theme. The music in the background is upbeat and a lot of the songs they play are a mix of R&B and alternative rock.

I chose Chicken Katsu ($8.49) and it comes with two scoop of rice and you have a choice of kimchee or macaroni salad. I chose kimchee with my meal and ask for a side order of Macaroni which cost $2.49. Usually I prefer to have brown rice, but it's not available at this location. The way I can tell if a restaurant is food quality approve is by seeing if they can make a really good Chicken Katsu. Chicken Katsu is one of the most popular items in Hawaiian cuisine. There isn't any way one can go wrong with deep frying chicken, unless it is deep-fried way too long and then it becomes burnt. 

Unfortunately that is exactly what happened with the order. I appreciate they give good portions of meat, but I am not happy that the Chicken Katsu is overcooked. You can totally see the difference how dark the meat came by comparing it with the previous order I had with L&L Hawaiian Barbecue. The texture of the Chicken Katsu is very crunchy and the meat taste dry. I had three different sauce: tobasco, katsu, and gravy. The gravy taste good, however it didn't make the meat taste any better and it's taking me awhile to chew it. Now the macaroni salad appears to be heavy on the mayo, and the kimchee taste watery and bland. The person who attended to my order is nice but once your meal is serve, they don't check up on you to see if you need anything else or if the food is okay. You are pretty much on your own."}
{"text":"Sorry AK, maybe I was just grumpy that day since I hadn't eaten for a gazillion hours....c'mon, I'm not the only one who goes all Beast Mode when hungry, right?...but the food here just did not hit the spot for our Hawaiian food craving. Let me start by saying the place itself looks like a legit Hawaiian restaurant with it's low key vibe and simple style. The menu has a lot of choices which is great. I, for one, have a go to meal plan when I nom Hawaiian style which includes chicken katsu and mac salad, of course. The food did not taste bad in any way...it just wasn't my style. The Katsu was thin, dry and chewy and the sauce was the tangier kind vs. the sweeter kind that I like. The mac salad was okay but the more I ate the less I liked it...when normally I order an extra side of mac salad to devour with my meal. Again, I may have just been grumpy gal that day but I still find myself craving my Hawaiian spot in the OC."}
{"text":"The food was good ESP the banana nut pancakes and the adobo fried rice omelette (wish it had a little more vinegar taste). The only issue we had was the service, which is EVERYTHING. There were a few rude individuals while dining here and I've heard a lot of good reviews about how excellent the service is here but I was quite disappointed. For the name to be \"Aloha\" I would assume that the service would show some Aloha but nope, don't be fooled. Oh and there's only 3 water jugs you're allowed to use and that' means sharing with the entire restaurant! Which sucks if you're dining in with a large group of people. So if I were you, I would bring your own water."}
{"text":"The food here at Aloha Kitchen is good compared to other Hawaiian restaurants in the area, they are quick and I always get my food hot and correct.

The service here is ok, the only words we get out of them is \"is it for here or to go\". For some reason Aloha has opted out of running its AC during the summer months but instead they have about 10 fans going which just circulate the hot air around and make for dining-in during the hot months very uncomfortable, not sure why they choose to do this but it keeps me from going more often. Overall an ok place to go for some island food on the east side."}
{"text":"The best spot to eat before leaving Vegas! 
Great staff and amazing food! Pork adobo fried rice is the way to go."}
{"text":"It's no Ono's.... they don't carry Katsu sauce...
The grilled chicken is just ok. And the kalbi is just \"Okay\" not the place to go to for authentic Hawaiian food.
The staff aren't very warm, and upon the multiple trips I've come in, desperate for Hawaiian food, sometimes I've gotten the dreaded lazy employee in the evening, who'd rather tell me a sauce isn't available then walk back to fill up a container. 
I'm being salty, sure, but that experience only dropped them an additional star - hence the 2/5"}
{"text":"Aloha Kitchen is a new Hawaiian restaurant that is located on the Southeast part of town close to the Green Valley area. This is part of a larger local franchise that has several well known locations around Vegas. They had recently opened and I wanted to check them out.

They are located on the corner of Maryland and Windmill, right off the 215 exit. The interior is really clean with booths and tables. They are in the process of being approved for gaming and a liquor license, so hopefully they will be allowed to get that, which would be interesting because that would be a first for me to see such a concept. They have the standard menu that all the Aloha Kitchen's have. I ordered the Kalbi combo and waited. They also gave me some free lumpia as their grand opening special.

Lumpia - the lumpia were hot and crispy. And they were not greasy at all. The meat filling was well seasoned, and I enjoyed the taste of them.

Kalbi Combo - I thought it was good. The Katsu was crispy, yet tender. The teriyaki was moist, and the Kalbi was cooked well. I thought the Kalbi was sliced a bit thin, and the rice and Mac salad were average, but overall, it was decent.

This is a good option if you are in the area and are digging some Hawaiian food. I thought the value was fair as well."}
{"text":"Aside from the loud college students over on the corner (at that bar, dunno the name), chillin outside, and hanging out inside waiting for their ONE friend who decided to actually eat.. I liked this place.

It's cozy, the people are nice, and they even bring your food over to your table.

I ordered the Bulkogi Plate ($8.50) which is marinated ribeye w/ 2 scoops of rice, salad, and macaroni salad.  MMMMM, soo good.

We got spam masubi on the side (rice, spam, and teriyaki sauce wrapped in seaweed), and is definitely worth a try if you've never had it before.

Um o yea, free refills!"}
{"text":"This place is bomb! The JR specialist my favorite. Sometimes is better than other days and sometimes it's different. It depends on whose cooking the food! It has it's pros and cons. But over all, the service is great. And the food is okay!"}
{"text":"No beating around the bush on this one! Delicious and Affordable. It's around the corner of my house and I go often and have NEVER been disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place quite the bang for your buck!! Its easy to miss if you aren't looking for it. It was very calm inside, not much noise at all. The food was great! Not the best but it's worth more than its priced. Its good overall"}
{"text":"I had the mix plate #4 (teriyaki chicken + bulgogi) and fried wontons and wasn't impressed. The portions are huge, and each plate comes with rice and your choice of macaroni potato salad or a salad. The bulgogi was a bit a tough, but the chicken was cooked well. The flavor of the plate was all a bit too one-note for me, and there aren't as many options (in terms of protein as well as sides) as other places. The fried wontons had a very miniscule amount of filling - probably about as small as a quail egg (for scale). If you're starving and looking for a big plate of food, this will work for you."}
{"text":"I love Aloha kitchen, I've been going for the last three years now, and it is fantastic. I always get the beef bulkogi, with a side of coconut shrimp and teriyaki sauce. The beef bulkogi can be hit or miss, where as the teriyaki chicken isn't necessarily as good, but is more consistent on taste. I love this place, and will go for years to come."}
{"text":"The food was good for the price. My girl and I shared a plate of regular mix plate # 2. It was enough for both of us. Does the job. Im a Native Maui Boy so it doesnt beat home, but close enough for being in Arizona. I wouldnt go out of my way to eat here, except for maybe on wednesday and saturday, when they actually serve Hawaiian style food like their Hawaiian Plate or Pork Laulau. If you're ever in the area, its definitely worth stopping by."}
{"text":"We moved to Yuma 2 months ago and we were already missing some good local food. We escaped to home for a little bit after visiting this place. I ordered the chicken katsu plate and it came with rice, mac salad, and a slice of cantaloupe. No complaints here! The mac salad was on point and the katsu sauce tasted just like zippys. It's only been a couple of hours and I'm ready to go back for more."}
{"text":"I love coming to Aloha on my lunch break! The food is excellent I love the combo with the katsu chicken and teryiaki chicken. Its big enough that I can take some leftovers to my 3 year old who also loves this place! Its fast, good cheap and service is good!"}
{"text":"I have no idea where the boyfriend found this place but he suggested for us to go here and we all loved it! 

I had the bulgogi and katsu combo and I loved the katsu. It came out hot and crispy. Bulgogi was okay because I was expecting it to be Korean flavored but it wasn't so it threw me off a little. I would go for the teriyaki next time instead because my boyfriend had that and it was amaze-balls  

All in all, we all enjoyed it and would definitely come back. The service was good and it didn't bother me that the decor was non existent but just wish the place was a little bigger because with all the tables, I felt a little cramped."}
{"text":"Delicious! My friend and I ordered the combination plate that has two different kinds of chicken, ribs, rice, and macaroni salad. Yum!! Lumpia Shanghai is really good too.

I like that you have the option of dining in and it's a nice atmosphere...not a fast food feeling. Other Hawaiian places I have ordered from have either only had a take-out option or didn't have a very inviting dining area."}
{"text":"My family and I were here for the Grand Opening. We came to watch our daughter dance. I convinced my wife to stay for dinner. We waited for over an hr for our food without being informed of the wait. In the process there was repeated accuracy mistakes made with missing items. I understood that there might be a long wait. But I wasn't prepared for the bad customer service we ended up receiving. You would think after voicing my experience that they would show some kind of customer service skills but it seemed they didn't care. I asked to speak to the manager about my experience and requested a refund. I even told the manager that I wouldn't be returning with my family. I told the manager that the meal should be free due to the bad service and experience. She left to speak to her manager and returned saying a refund is all she can do. You would think a restaurant that carries Aloha in their brand would practice good customer service but there is \"No Aloha Here\" I won't be returning and neither will my family. We roll deap 20 + people. I would recommend you to go to Island Flavor or Aloha Specialties for a great Aloha experience"}
{"text":"Aloha Kitchen is so yummy! Our food came out hot and fresh. Oh, and the customer service was fantastic! I did not expect authentic Hawaiian food in Arizona, but this place is run by Polynesians who do it right.

Beats L&L any day."}
{"text":"Excellent Hawaiian breakfast and food!!!  The teriyaki chicken is nice and crispy on the outside with good sauce."}
{"text":"This was and is honestly my go-to whenever I'm at school/work and craving Hawaiian. They're always efficient and have the basic dishes I loved as a kid. 
This past experience, I ordered for pick-up from work. By the time I got there (10-15 minutes after the call), my food was ready. 
LOL. Chicken Katsu's exterior was a little more cooked than golden brown, but that's fine with me. No complaints since the rest of the dish was still good along with their customer service. 
Only difference I noticed was the setting/layout of this location, but things are bound to change after like 3 years, right?"}
{"text":"This Aloha Kitchen is located right beside UNLV, easily accessed via walking through the bookstore / Student Union. In this plaza, you will also find Baja Bar & Grill, Firehouse Subs, and Smashburger. If you're looking for a quick Hawaiian fix, then Aloha Kitchen is the right choice!

I usually go for the adobo fried omelette, which is basically exactly what it sounds like. If they have it, sometimes I go for the oxtail soup. Some say it can be a little fatty, but I would say it's a lottle fatty. They give you a huge bowl with some piece of oxtail meat and another bowl of rice. Sometimes I can't finish it and bring the rest of it home!

This location isn't 24 hours like the other one in the Henderson area. There are plenty of tables and booths to sit in, however, it can get pretty busy during lunch time!"}
{"text":"I don't review often. But I do when it's definitely worth sharing.  My rating is based on a combination of the whole experience--food taste, quality, quantity, presentation and SERVICE. 

Three words:  ADOBO RICE OMELET.  

Ok, plus two more words:  LOCO MOCO

Ok, ok..... and the CORNED BEEF HASH was perfectly crispy and tasty, too!

Thanks, Aloha Kitchen!  Your service is great, friendly and quick!

I mentioned you in my article in the Asian Journal (Community section), but because I was in a hurry to submit it to my editor, I wasn't able to get the address info in.  But I did add it on our website :)

We visited your restaurant on July 4th, 2011!!

Thanks!!!

{"text":"I use to go here a lot. Since moving to North Las Vegas, NV I rarely go. I do notice one thing, actually quite a few things. It seems like the food has changed. It definitely is not for the better."}
{"text":"As teriyaki chicken rice bowls go, this place has an okay one at a reasonable price, especially on the student special.  It's nothing spectacular, but it's filling enough.  Maybe I'll return to try something more interesting, but I'm not in a huge hurry to do so.
I hate downgrading, but today's visit was kind of icky.  I had a student special again, this time with added vegetables.  They drowned the vegetables in more gooey teriyaki sauce (the chicken bowl last time had just enough to be tasty), and they were blah vegetables (celery and cabbage, just short of overcooked) at that."}
{"text":"ordered the calbi ribs and instead of rice switched it with two scoops of their macaroni salad. Pretty solid lunch if you ask me. Enough to get you satisfied and through the day. Although the ribs turned up a little burnt, but  it didn't bother me."}
{"text":"Technically, this is a short review because I only ordered one thing! My daughter and I have an affinity for Spam Masubi and I wanted to order a dozen or so for her graduation party. I attempted to order from the bigger chain Hawaiian eatery here in town but it was just too difficult to communicate with the employee on the phone. Hence Aloha Kitchen! They were closer, convenient and far easier and more pleasant on the phone. Didn't have to order too far in advance, in fact, they made them all fresh in less than 10 minutes while we waited. They helped make a busy day a little easier and very tastey."}
{"text":"There's something about this particular aloha kitchen location that makes it better than the others.
My favorites are the loco moco, aloha plate, and local plate. I usually come here in between classes to get enough energy to get through the day. I love their chicken Katsu and teriyaki and it's always the same great taste with great portions."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to head out to the Galleria Mall today and visit Best Buy and Costco.  We were there early and the stores were not open yet.  So, we decided to grab a brunch.  As we drove around looking for a place to eat, we noticed a small restaurant located on a strip outside of the Sunset Casino ~ the Alohoa Kitchen.  We figure it was a mom/pop kinda restaurant and thought it would be good to try and dine here.

Here is the good.  As you walk in, it is pretty clean and spacious.  It has a \"Tiki\" type built to it.  Pretty cool.  Also, from the menu offering, everything was reasonably priced ~ about $8-10 per plate.

Now, the bad... no customers were in the restaurant (bad sign).  I ordered the Teriyaki Chicken with rice.  And, my wife ordered the Ribs with rice.  It was served on a styro-foam plate with soft utensils.

Oh my, okay... breathe... while eating the rice, it was like grinding pebbles.  I had to turn to my wife and tell her that we are in Bedrock.  Call me Fred Flintstones and her Wilma.  We needed Bam Bam to hammer the rice and make it edible.  

Note to the cook:  How to cook rice... Pour rice into rice cooking pot, ADD WATER (I think this step was seriously missed), make sure you measure at least a 1/3 index finger size of water at the top, press cook, and wait for 30 minutes for beep.  Damn!  How hard is it to cook rice man!  I know we live in Las Vegas, it is in a desert, and we need to conserve water; but dog, just sacrifice and add a cup of water to your rice.  

As for the Teriyaki chicken, I think they served me \"yesterday's\" chicken.  It tasted like \"over-nuked\" chicken.  Extremely rubbery and very tasteless.  In order to hide this deficiency, the cook LATHERED the chicken in Teriyaki sauce.  The end result:  It looked and tasted like eating Molasses with uncooked rice.  yuck, yuck and ga-zillion yuck.

I ate 3 spoonful too many.

As for my wife's Ribs, it was tough as hell.  Again, it was obviously nuked.

Of note, there are people in the world who think they can cook, who are good cooks, who can open a restaurant, and survive...

And, then, there are owners like the Aloha Kitchen, who think they can cook, who have no clue how bad their food is, who still ends up opening a restaurant, and who probably would not survive.

Finally, I would not recommend this place.  We definitely will NOT return.  For two of us, with drinks, and tip, it amounted to $24.  Honestly, a better deal would be to go to Chili's -- have a decent appetizer and 2 entrees for $20.... 

I wished we can rate this a ZERO or negative star..."}
{"text":"Service service on POINT!  The food is OK and that is it. I ordered the teriyaki chicken plate with macaroni & potato salad mash-up, salmon ala carte and guava cake. The teriyaki sauce taste as though it was a bought product versus making it in house.  The Macaroni & Potato Salad mashup had too much vinegar for my taste. There was no cabbage and that is one of my favorite things when having Hawaiian food it's the cabbage and there was none. As for the guava cake and it's more like a poke cake with whipped cream and a jelly leather type guava paste on top. My daughter had the salmon ala carte and she was quite pleased and enjoyed it. I would only give this three stars but the woman running the cash register was fantastic and quite friendly so I upped it one more star because of her."}
{"text":"Good for a fast healthy meal depending on what you order. Get the to-go usually because the portions are a little bigger. Only 5$ for a chicken bowl combo which for me seems definitely worth the prices  you get some rice and chicken and some really good sauce so it's healthy and has a good proportion of calories but if you don't like it drenched in sauce then get it on the side."}
{"text":"The last 4 times in a row that I have ordered there I have had to wait 10 or more minutes after the given time to get my food after arriving at the restaurant. They used to be quick, not sure what happened. Will not be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place.. I tell everyone I know it it's authentic and delicious."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I love this place! We go all the time. Our recommendations are the mix plate #3, the saimin salad, sweet and sour chicken, and the teriyaki chicken. But the thing we LOVE are the manupuas. We are always so bummed when they run out. The staff are always so pleasant and friendly. We have never had a bad experience since we discovered them."}
{"text":"Are you hungry and in need of a hearty meal at a fair price?

Then Aloha Kitchen is the place you want to go.

I've been coming here for years, and my family and I absolutely LOVE Aloha Kitchen.  This is a place that my kids always want to go.

When I come here, I usually order one of these three dishes:

Chicken Katsu & Teriyaki Chicken Combo with white rice and the green salad.

or

The J.R. Special

or

Wonton Saimin Soup with a side of hot mustard to add another dimension to the broth.


Once in a blue moon, I'll order the Chinese Chicken Salad.  This thing is huge! (That's what she said.)  It's a bowl of salad of epic proportions.  It's also delicious.

Other than the food, the prices are fair.  (Please pay with cash, so they can keep their costs low and pass on the savings to us.)

The staff is always, ALWAYS friendly.

If you are in the mood to hear live Hawaiian/Polynesian music, go there on one of their designated Wednesdays.

Don't come on a Monday, since they are closed that day.

See you there."}
{"text":"Cute inside. Love the tropical theme. Even the ceiling fans complete the vibe. I ordered a combo meal because I wanted to try multiple things being this my first time there. I got the #3 which had katsu chicken and teriyaki chicken with rice. I have to say, this is by far the best Hawaiian food I've ever had. They grill the teriyaki chicken and load it with sauce. The sauce that comes on the side for the Kastu chicken is a savory mix of sweet and little spicy. Loved it! Definitely will go back for more."}
{"text":"If this place was at the Hawaiian Market place, I would go. But unfortunately, there are no Hawaiian food establishments there?! So, this is the closest place I could find.
It's okay overall. The mac salad isn't what I was used to (which is important with Hawaiian foods) and the quality of food itself was okay. Was it worth the $30 taxi ride to go back and forth from here? not really...

I like that the place is clean and roomy. Finding a seat was easy and of course, they had Tabasco available too. Great place just to have options to be able to eat Hawaiian food but average overall. It doesn't stand out or make me crave this place much.

The price is good for being closer to the strip but comparable to other Hawaiian restaurants."}
{"text":"All their food is very good, and their portions are very generous. Some of it isn't true \"Hawaiian\" style but it's all still delicious! My favorites are the Adobo Rice Omelette and any Katsu dish because their Katsu sauce is not overly sweet and \"high fructose corn syrup-tasting\" like L&L is. It is a little more expensive than Ross J's which is the best deal in town but I think it's worth it since there are a few items on the menu here that Ross J's doesn't have that I like such as the omelette I mentioned."}
{"text":"So I ordered food from Uber and being from Hawaii I ordered teriyaki beef and also the mahi-mahi. Mahi mahi ,  the breading was non-existent  and it looks like a piece of egg , tartar sauce?  let's just call it Mayo, the teriyaki beef the cuts were horrendous and the sauce was so pathetic. This was one of the most nastiest s*** that I have ever had in my life. So generic... I don't even know what else to say about the food here besides nasty"}
{"text":"Great customer service... convenient hours 24 ;) food cooked like it's cooked in the islands"}
{"text":"i don't get what people see in this place. dreary ambiance, stifling and muggy air (no airflow and circulation), inefficient staff (but nice) , average to below average food, weird and strange customers, blah, blah, blah.....katsu chicken was a greasy cutlet of breading with very little chicken served with cocktail sauce. i thought i was at pete's fish and chips. rather than the \"eat at pete's\" bumper sticker i'm going with the \"aloha aloha kitchen\" sticker. as in hello goodbye kitchen. never again"}
{"text":"Compared to Rick's fried rice adobo this omlet has its own standard of good. What I like about this establishment...I like the serving size and it's decently priced. The service is fabulous. Hope to visit again soon."}
{"text":"First off, I really enjoyed the food here! We got the chicken katsu and adobo combo, which tasted great and authentic. We also got the chicken teriyaki bowl which was very standard, and the banana pancakes with macadamia but topping, which was glorious!

I will say for all the flavor, I wish they put a bit more rice, and probably added a small side of salad or something to add some color but also alkaline/veggies to make it feel a bit healthier and more balanced.

I also wished the banana pancakes had like ice cream or some whipped cream, but it was still very delicious on its own.

Price-wise, it was decent. I forgot the exact prices but the pancakes were another $6, the combo was about $8 or $9, and the chicken bowl was about $6, so a little over $20 total. Not a bad deal.

Overall would definitely come back. I wish they added some more veggies to the combos but otherwise it's a great experience."}
{"text":"The price was right, but I left still hungry..... Let me start by saying that if I was more into greasy/ fried food I would have loved it, but I'm not. I ordered the mini plate of chicken (not sure how to spell it) and there was still skin on it. Yuck! At closer inspection it was also loaded with fat. About half of my chick plate was fat. I didn't eat any of it. I did however eat off of my significant others plate. He ordered a #4. That was pretty good, but he also would not touch my chicken. The side salad was good and the little bbq buns were good. I won't be back because this style of food is not for me. However, if you have a hangover and need some grease to counteract the alcohol poisoning this is a place I would recommend."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat Hawaiian food. I bring all my friends here. I always get local plate. Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Dis place stay serving local kine grinds since 1986 - that stay last century, bra. Everybody else went come late to the Hawaiian BBQ/plate lunch gravy train. L&L was one contendah but now they stay gone from da east side (still get da one in Flagstaff - oops no wait I mean North Phoenix). Ono Hawaiian BBQ, Moki's, Golden Hawaiian BBQ - they all ok but dis place stay da real deal for decades now. When dis blala get homesick dis is da place fo' kaukau li'dat. Even the staff working here speak da kine - pidgin to da max bra, buncha tittas and mokes. That's authentic, bra, I no shit you. So my favorite here is da combo #2 mix plate. That's da one with Chicken Katsu (deep fried chicken cutlet that they went chop up li'dat) and da kine - bulgogi (yobo kine marinated beef). Plus two big blala portion scoops rice and macaroni salad. Many places make da macaroni salad mainland style - this stay Hawaiian style, bra, cannot compare. For drink I went always get da kine Hawaiian Sun juice drinks but now opu too big so gotta get da kine water bottled in Hawaii and blessed by Madam Pele instead. Dis last time I also got da kine, Manapua. Was good - you can get something sorta li'dat if you go eat da kine place dat serve dim sum. Dis one remind me of da kine I used to get fo' twenty five cents from da truck dat came to my school fo' sell dat and rice cake to all da keikis way back in hanabata days. I went come with some folks from my workplace. Da wahine I went come with tried to order one Salmon salad. I went tell her you need either da kine glasses or da kine remedial reading classes. It's Saimin not Salmon. She went give me stink eye - bra, I was just trying fo' help li'dat. Anyway, dis stay part of da lunch rotation li'dat. Plenny parking, bra - same mall as da kine pizza place - Nello's I tink. On weekends they get mo' betta selection - poke and laulau li'dat. Check it out, bruddah! Mo' betta than pig, mo' betta than poi. I give this place da big shaka sign. Hawaii!"}
{"text":"This place is great for a quick bite to eat.. The food was good but not great.. We had the spam musubi, ox tail soup and rice adobo omelet.. There's a Karaoke bar in the next room so for those who want to eat and sing, this place would be great.. I'm not certain if I'm a fan yet but will gladly come back to try other food selection on the menu..."}
{"text":"I am in love with this place. I was driving by with my friend and she informed me that this place had really great food. I am always up for trying something new and delicious. 

When I walked in the restaurant looks relax, they have comfortable seating, the menu is pretty large. My friend recommended me to try the Local Plate witch includes Teriyaki chicken, teriyaki Beef, Hawaiian Macaroni salad, steam rice and two spam masubi for less than $8.

For starters this was definitely a plate to have, never had a spam masubi and man I tell you I dream of having one of those everyday. Even If you never been a spam fan this will definitely change your mind. One thing I would inform the seaweed that it is wrap with the flavor is a little strong but It goes very well. You must try and see for yourself. 

I can honestly say this place will have you addicted!!!!"}
{"text":"We stopped here for a quick lunch after doing some errands and shopping. The restaurants was pretty empty with two other patrons there besides us. The restaurant was clean and well kept, and the decor was much more subdued and classier than some of the other Hawaiian restaurants in town. We ordered two different combination plates with two scoops of rice and one scoop of macaroni salad. The chicken was thin and dry, and unfortunately the highlight of the meal. I couldn't stomach the beef as it had a very distinct, off putting, odor to it. The pork was also dry and had an off putting smell. I did not want to chance a food poisoning so I just ate the chicken and rice. The macaroni salad tasted like it had been marinaded in a cleaning solution. The price is fair for the amount of food you get, but in this case I would opt for quality over quantity. I don't plan on coming back."}
{"text":"I was a little weary of this restaurant just because I didn't know what kind of food it would be, but my husband and I came in on a whim. We did not regret it! The kalbi ribs were amazing. A little fatty, but still amazing. The rice was cooked perfect as well. There was a short wait time and that was it. We will be returning!"}
{"text":"Aloha Kitchen definitely makes the best Hawaiian food in Arizona- just make sure you go on Saturdays early in the day, because this is the only day of the week that both Laulau and Kalua pig is served, and they often sell out by early dinner time.    

I would recommend the Hawaiian plate that comes with Kalua pig, lomi salmon, and long rice.  The laulau is decent, however they add too much fat to this dish to keep it moist.  The saimin is pretty average, and can be described as bland.  All of the Aloha Mix Plates are really good and come with macaroni-potato salad (my favorite) or a vegetable salad.  Also, try the guava cake-it is so good!

The restaurant is pretty small, with about 10 tables in the entire restaurant, and one restroom.  Many of the tables were dirty, and several of the chair seats were worn out.  If you can look past the aesthetics of the restaurant interior, the food is really great!  Still giving this place 5 stars."}
{"text":"Adobo fried rice is so bomb. Service is great and food is delicious. Win or lose in Vegas I try to make my way here."}
{"text":"Best restaurant. My family has come here for years and it has always been our go to! The teriyaki chicken is the best (you could drink the sauce) followed closely by the potato mac (put a little teriyaki sauce on it)! And the price can't be beat! Taken many people here and never had anyone leave disappointed, even a friend from Hawaii that said it was supper authentic."}
{"text":"Had the Adobo rice Omelette and tapsilog. Sooo good!  The adobo fried rice omelette is a big serving - definitely worth the price."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been here and I just find myself ordering the same thing again!  The Adobo Fried Rice Omelet hits the spot once again after a night full of drinking.  The portion of this omelet is enough to feed two...... but who goes here to share?!?!?!?!  
From the first bite, you can easily tell the chicken has been marinating its its adobo juice.  The rice is there to just suck up all the flavors.  
I like to add a layer of Siracha hot sauce on top to give it a little kick.  This place is soo good!  The staff is really nice too!  
Ill be back in February so hopefully I have courage to try something different................ like their tosilog............then get the Adobo Omelet to go!! Hahaha!"}
{"text":"For a Hawaii born, I was pleasantly surprised. Tried the Teri burger, fried noodles, and chicken teriyaki. All of it was super yummy, especially when you miss home. Portions are generous for the price! Definitely another go to place!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went there a few times over the last month and every time one of us gets the chicken katsu.  We brought our in laws there and they liked it as well..given my wife and in laws lived in Hawaii and love this place speaks volumes.   Not too fancy and every time we have dined in, we noticed there seem to be a lot of locals/regulars...a good sign."}
{"text":"Great options for Hawaiian and filipino food! Environment is also nice! The place is clean and well kept, great music, and nice workers :)"}
{"text":"Hair in the rice!  The longhaired, ponytailed, non-hairnet wearer female ordertaker gave no apologies as she worked hard at pulling out the strand from the rice on my plate.  How disappointing to hear the excuses....\"Oh, I no cook rice and you can see the guys in the kitchen no mor hair.\" Does that prove anything?  No, it just emphasizes carelessness and lack of customer service skills
 saying you don't want my return business and that of others. 
No kokua, not kamaaina,  so, aloha oe."}
{"text":"I heard about Aloha Kitchen from Yelp.  Apparently, they've been at this same location for around 24 years, wow!

The service was good.  The person who took my order helped me pick my entree since it was my first time there.

I had the Bulkogi and Chicken Katsu combination for $7.95.  I wasn't overwhelmed by the quality of the food, but the flavor was nice and it was a good change of pace from the same old deli experience.  It was more than enough food for me, so I guess the price was right for the value.  Aloha Kitchen isn't going to become my new regular spot, but I'd go again."}
{"text":"Um, this place is delicious and reminds me of all the Hawaiian food of my youth when we'd head to Kauai. Great chicken katsu, teriyaki, tasty shrimp, excellent macaroni salad. Can't wait to go back to try more as I hear the Kalua pig and salmon are awesome! Super unassuming place, prompt service, lots of families dining over tasty food, I'm such a fan that I try to convince the husband to go every week!"}
{"text":"So it's been a year since I stepped foot in here and this time it was more pleasant as far as service.  Huge improvement in fact.  The guy working that evening was really cool and helpful.  They had some special deals on their menu.  $6.99 for 5 bbq pork sticks 2 scoops of rice (which I passed up on) and mac salad. The bbq pork taste wise was good, meat marinated throughout, just the cut of meat wasn't the best, so the texture was more on the tough side. But I'm still open to trying out other menu items next time."}
{"text":"Best Hawaiian food on the planet!! Except maybe in Hawaii, but you get my drift. I love everything here! Bulgogi and Potato Mac salad!! Yum!!"}
{"text":"I am very surprised at finding this good reviews here. Actually one of my co-workers referred me here.  However, it was not my taste.  I had Aloha plate.  Teriyaki was just like ordinarily Teriyaki sauce in grocery store, too sweet.  I wish it could be my favorite dining option because it is very close to my office and home.  Too bad, it did not come true..."}
{"text":"I'm happy they opened up at this location.. Ordered the kalbi ribs and I loved it, cooked perfectly.. Will definitely come again.."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this restaurant multiple times and have not been disappointed yet. I typically order the student special ($5 chicken teriyaki and a drink) but the rest of the menu is fantastic as well.

From the Kalua pig to the spam musubi, the food is flavorful and filling. The prices are reasonable and the amount of food you receive makes for wonderful next day leftovers.

This is one of those restaurants that after eating I always ask myself: \"why don't I go here more often?\" Good prices and even better food, I couldn't ask for more out of a restaurant."}
{"text":"Great food and service! We were first timers And Neil was very helpful to us and recommended the Adobo fried rice, chicken katsu and kolbi beef was bomb!!! Everything was great, will def come back!"}
{"text":"sigh... i use to eat here when i was in college. and now i ate there today and had good rice and spam... but what tasted like day old chicken and tough beef on the bento box. it did not leave a good impression on me. i really loved eating there during college. sigh how things do change.  sadly i know the aloha at the california hotel or ross j would have been a better idea to assuage my hawaiian cravings..."}
{"text":"OmGosh excellent customer service!  I must say Neil is one heck of a server!!!   Love the Kalbi Ribs, definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"So came here yesterday, because I was craving adobo fried rice. Of course I wasn't disappointed and my craving was definitely satisfied! What wasn't good was the kalbi combo plate that my honey ordered. For those who don't know, it comes with teriyaki chicken, chicken katsu and of course kalbi. Now what disappointed me is how it was cooked! All the meat was overcooked and dried! I understand that the place gets busy, but please pay attention to what you're cooking! Make all of your dishes popular and not just the Adobo fried rice. Just my take."}
{"text":"This place is a tough place to rate, just because we go here so often in every Las Vegas trip, we find ourselves here. I don't think this is the best hawaiian place ever, being that i've gone to Hawaii, but this is the best Hawaiian place in Las Vegas, at least it's my favorite. There are others, but not like Aloha Kitchen, in Vegas.

I do like to support your local Filipino's and they're here to help them. 

*Adobo Fried Rice over Egg - This place is famous for this item. If you eat this by yourself, you're probably a food eating champ, a teenager, or haven't eaten in a while. Very duable, but very heavy. It is a lot of rice. I recommend eating with a friend. 

PRO-TIP: If you get the adobo fried rice, it is likely all the other dishes will have rice as well. Try to get a la carte items you want or you'll have tons of rice left over. I've made this mistake many times. 

**Portuguese Sausage, eggs, and rice - Least to say, I love this dish, but they need to put more sausage on this plate for my big body. The rice to sausage ratio is overwhelming on this plate. They need to reconsider the amount of rice for the loaf of sausage they give. I personally want more sausage, but I can't complain. 

***Spam Musubi - The classic side dish, works everytime. I always think they over do the rice in every place that makes musubi. It must be a thing, but I could just use half the amount they put in musubi's. That will probably not change.  

There really is so much here to order and I love everything on the menu. I have a hard time looking and up and seeing if I want that today. It's tough being from california and having to pick only one for this one time of the year. I want to order everything! Thanks for the meal!"}
{"text":"A good spot to go for \" in a hurry \" situation Hawaiian food. Was my favorite in town but I feel like they are starting to go cheap in ingredients and you can really taste it in the food.."}
{"text":"Best Hawaiian in town, this place was a staple for me in the college years.  I could live off the manapua.  The humble decor leaves you in for an even better surprise when you taste the food.  Had a friend that lived in Hawaii for several years and he said the food here was just like home.  They have music on some days and advertise cultural events happening in the valley.  Fun, cheap, good eats."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst hawaiian bbq place I've ever eaten. I ordered the aloha mixed plate which the food tasted like it was microwaved and not cooked to order.

The bbq beef was hard and chewy like jerky and the sauce was over the counter. The teriyaki chicken was so hard I never even continued to finish the rest. The only decent thing on the plate was the chicken katsu which would be the easiest thing to make. The mac salad I had to ask the cashier for it because it wasnt on the plate. I wouldnt come back even if I am too hungry to think otherwise...

Please make the food atleast when the customer orders it because it gives a bad reputation to hawaiian food like back home. I dont normally give bad reviews but the food really killed my mood and the $10 plate seemed like it would be like a $1. Otherwise the cashier was friendly and the atmosphere was nice. Really like the bamboo decor."}
{"text":"I've heard the food is pretty good so I wanted to order catering for a birthday party of 30 people. I went to the store to inquire. Young man behind the counter was very helpful but wasn't able to actually take my order and had to go through the manager/owner who was at the time talking to some friends at a table. I completely understand and told him I didn't mind waiting and the young man suggested to have him call me. I said that was fine and gave him my phone number. Young man said he would call me As soon as he was done with this conversation. Today is Thursday 3:30 PM and still no call. I called on Wednesday to inquire I was told that he would call me the next day in the morning. Thursday morning came and went no phone calls. You would think if you were too busy you would either call the customer and tell them you couldn't for fill the catering order or tell you what employees to make the call. To make a customer waiting in limbo trying to put together a surprise 90th birthday party on the upcoming Saturday Is not professional and from my standpoint lacks extreme customer service. Guess I'll stay with old reliable, Mokis in Mesa."}
{"text":"Made this stop our last stop on our Vegas vacation before heading back home to  San Diego. Smart choice. The food satisfied our appetite! I ordered the adobo fried rice omelette, my daughter had the topsilog plate, my husband had the local plate...all were yummy. Fried rice portion is huge! The only thing I would change is the teriyaki chicken...it seems like it was fried and teriyaki sauce poured over it. Nothing compares to authentic food from hawaii, but Aloha Kitchen is pretty close."}
{"text":"Looooove this place! Blows the other Hawaiian places in AZ out of the water! Prices are on the low end and two can expect to eat for about $23. Only critique I have is that they should open later than 8p. I can't tell you how many times I've been there till close and there is a line till the last minute"}
{"text":"This place is okay. Chicken katsu is the standard crispy panko fried chicken. Avoid the mahi mahi, it tastes like its either not fresh or been frozen too long. I tried my friend's adobo fried rice omelet, which was good. 

Overall its an okay hawaiin place with hearty portion sizes."}
{"text":"Authentic Hawaiian style restaurant with Amazing food! Highly recommend their Katsu chicken and beef plate. Everyone is always super friendly. When I was there the owner was sitting out in the restaurant area and he was very gracious and thanked me for coming. Guy Fieri from The Food Network was there a few months ago and Aloha Kitchen was highlighted on the Food Network. The owner talked a little bit about that with me and the episode which was filmed at the location. I can completely see why Guy would have chosen this restaurant which has amazing food every time I've come and visited. Next time I go I will be sure to get the Manapua which is freshly made daily. It's is a Pork stuffed dumpling and has been highly recommended to me by several people."}
{"text":"My very first boss (from the island) would order us take-out from Aloha Kitchen, and almost fifteen years later, it's still amazing! Best Katsu in town!"}
{"text":"This place has some delicious Hawaiian food! Known for its fusion of Filipino and Hawaiian food, they offer both. I decided to go for the combo plate consisting of kalbi and chicken teriyaki. 

The kalbi. WOW. So tender with each bite and full of flavor. They offer plenty of it which was to my surprise. For the teriyaki chicken, it doesn't get any better. It's juicy and has a nice crisp to the skin. They only thing I would do different is ask them to make the chicken teriyaki crispier. For my plate, I opted for no Katsu and double the chicken teriyaki. 

I'll be back to try some of the Filipino food. They have 5 locations in the Las Vegas area. So I recommend trying one most convenient to you. The prices and reasonable and the portions are big."}
{"text":"The best Hawaiian fusion food in Las Vegas! Adobo Fried Rice is awesome! The oxtail soup is far better than expected. Lumpia Shanghai is crispy and tasty. Fried Portuguese sausage is Hawaii. Uncle\"s grilled pork was the best. Well marinated, tender, and grilled to perfection. The Korean ribs was actually better than mine... Hahaha! No, I make the best Korean bbq ribs. The best part is the food at aloha kitchen is tasty and plentiful. Definitely a go-to-place after a night of partying and gambling! Awesome place!"}
{"text":"I expect a lot from certain types of restaurants and Hawaiian is one of them.  I found the food to be authentic, the service we received reminded me of Island service.  We came in on a Monday before lunch and settled on breakfast.  The pancakes reminded me of our favorites in Hilo, although they do use a LOT of syrup.  The sausage, rice & egg combo was filling and on point.

It's not the Island, but definitely brings real Hawaii to Vegas."}
{"text":"Small mum and pop business that's been in the east valley for over 25 years.

The price and meal portions have been on point.
Aside from their usual menu, they also offer \"Specials\" for the day. 
Service is prompt, and warm... Yes, with the aloha vibe.
Food? Let's just say we have yet to eat something we do not like! ^_^

Just remember, it's very busy during lunch and most dinner hours. So be patient if you are in there round those times. Alooooooha! 

Xx"}
{"text":"Do not come here expecting L&L, the Loft, or Ohana. You will be disappointed. 

My definition of a mixed plate = mass quantities of outstanding comfort food. This place lacks in the quantity area, but the tastes are hit and miss. Thus my rating.

Details: 

Kalua Pork: excellent, not too salty. Flavor is right on. 
Mahi Mahi: pretty damn good.
Lau Lau: not bad, but not the best I've had. 
Chicken Katsu: maybe I got yesterday's. It tasted stale and heavy, with a strange aftertaste. 
BBQ pork: meh. 

Prices: average
Service: the people were friendly, and above average."}
{"text":"We've been coming to Aloha Kitchen for years. I most especially love the adobo omelette. Love this place! Always going to be our go-to touchdown spot when arriving to Vegas. Food is amazing as always!"}
{"text":"First time here wuth my family. Was in search of a quick bite to eat. The restaurant is connected to a bar, so we did happen to go through the bar instead of the restaurant. Which was a little confusing. Walked into the restaurant side and ordered our food. They offer a wide variety of menu items. From appetizers to ramen. The dining room is spacious and has ceiling fans as well. Our food was delicious! Spam musubi, Portuguese sausage and eggs, also had the loco plate beef and chicken teriyaki. I understand this is Vegas, but our food was served hot. And the ceiling fan just cooled the food so fast that it was a little disappointing. But still had a good experience here. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"YUUMMM ONO-LICIOUS!

mahalo for the great food guys :)

although it's not exactly the same thing as back on islands, it's pretty darn close if you ask me! i love this place and i'll miss it if/when i move out of vegas."}
{"text":"Ordered a student special, musubi, and side of Mac sal Togo, waited 30 min for the order, then decided to ask for a side of Teri, after watching about 10 people get their order before me! They charged me $0.27 for it, and I still had to wait! Now I got to get to class and eat my lunch after, so much for a hot meal! I still love their food, but this experience left a sour taste in my mouth!"}
{"text":"IF YOU COME TO VEGAS, YOU ABSOLUTELY NEED TO STOP BY ALOHA KITCHEN FOR THEIR ADOBO OMELETTES! 

I swear, nothing beats a 6am morning with adobo omelettes!  The best thing is that you can buy one and share it among your three tiny female friends or among your large self. 

it's off the strip, but if you drove to Vegas, it's worth the pickup.  I swear it beats the food court's overpriced pizza or pasta, more fulfilling and cheaper than the buffet at the Wynn."}
{"text":"Good, authentic Hawaiian food in the middle of the desert.  I enjoyed their Kalua Pig with Cabbage, Pork Laulau, Lomi Salmon, Chicken Long Rice and Manapua (steamed buns). This place has been around for years and there's a reason why.  

They should open another location in Phoenix -- preferably near 16th st. and Camelback.   ;)"}
{"text":"Mahalo Aloha Kitchen!!
We were recently there for dinner and a party of  20 for my daughters graduation. The food was ono, portions were just right, and your services were so pleasant and wonderful.. everything was perfect!!

We ordered small pans of Kalbi, fried saimin, teri chicken, katsu, and side orders of adobo omelete and french fries. Everything was delicious, authentic-local :)"}
{"text":"We had the Chicken Katsu and Kalbi and it was ok...until about an hour later, all 6 of us that ate the Chicken Katsu had MAJOR stomach issues the rest of the day!  Probably will not go back here again...Chicken was under cooked..."}
{"text":"This place is the heart and soul of my stomach. It hasn't changed in the 16 years I've been going there, and the staff is still the best around."}
{"text":"When you don't want anything from the student union or the DC, walk next door to aloha kitchen if you're craving for yummy local grinds. Unlike other chained hawaiian restaurants, aloha actually has that home cooked taste with yummy flavor. Especially with the 4.99 student special, this is definitely my go-to spot :)"}
{"text":"Quick service! Amazing food! Excellent prices! Fried bananas were outstanding. Unbeatable.  I love Katsu. Grew up on the stuff. just like mama used to make. Wow. Just wow. Beautiful staff, beautiful interior. I love it here. Have my children? Kidding. But seriously. Great food."}
{"text":"Always good , the katsu chicken is great, they ran out of manapuas, bummer, eating some fried saimin noodles this time, best Hawaiian with out going to the islands."}
{"text":"I would give this place 3.5 stars. The staff is really nice and the place has a good amount of tables and is clean. The food was just okay though. The macaroni salad had too much mayo in it and the meat was a little red and burnt too. I got a mini bulgolgi plate."}
{"text":"I'm giving 4 stars for the spam musubi and whatever my mom ordered last time (which might be chicken teriyaki). The adobo fried rice omelette is good, but the one in Babystacks is better. The Portuguese sausage is mediocre. Overall, probably 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Love this place. Love the food. My family and I love their katsu, bulgogi and teriyaki. Very tasty. The staffs are very nice and restaurant is clean. We usually come here on the weekends. Try their coconut dessert..its pretty good!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I eat here all the time and we noticed the sudden change in the quality and portion size of the food here. Normally, I would give this place a good review because the food is tasty but now its under-seasoned and sub par. The chicken katsu is much thinner now and they even skimp out on the katsu sauce. We ordered Loco Moco and basically got a small meat patty, severely over cooked eggs (we ordered over easy) and a measly amount of gravy. The whole box was seriously just white rice. Maybe its just better to dine in here instead of ordering take out? The staff is always really friendly and courteous. The restaurant itself is always really clean too. It will be awhile before we ever decide to come and eat here again."}
{"text":"I am annoyingly particular when it comes to Hawaiian food.  I spent some time in Maui, really immersed in quality local food.  A lot of people offer it here but not everyone does it right.  This place does it perfectly & authentically.

I was a little hesitant.  The location doesn't offer any frills, it's in a strip mall that seems a little run down.  But what it lacks in decor, it makes up in flavor completely.

I think it's really telling when a restaurant is packed for lunch, which it was.  Filled to the brim with an array of people from all walks of life... young, old, business people, moms & kids.  We ordered lunch to go, expecting to wait a while but service was prompt.  We were in and out within ten minutes.

Teriyaki chicken was perfection.  Charred & crispy, but moist & flavorful with each bite.  The serving portions were huge!  I had a couple of meals worth for about ten dollars.  The mac salad was also well done & only added to the meal, instead of being just a bland side dish.  We also ordered a pork bun, don't skip out on this!  It was the best one I've had in a while.

I can't wait to go back to try their Kalua pork which is only served Wednesday & Saturday.  This place really did remind me of Hawaii."}
{"text":"I gave this place 2.5 stars. 

Being a fan of Hawaiian BBQ, I was excited to check out this place after reading all these great reviews. However, I was quite disappointed with my visit. 

First off, the ambient looks old and tacky. The servers' straight faces while interacting with customers didn't help. I felt like they could care less about what they're doing there. 

Regarding the food, I wanted to try the manupua but they don't offer it on Sundays. Additionally, when I put in an order for fried saimin, they didn't have the charsiu originally (or spam to substitute either). So I ended up with a mini order of chicken katsu to go. 

The food came out really fast. The potato - mac salad is indeed flavorful and addicting. Chicken was crispy from the outside and juicy inside. Although it's a mini order, the portion is really good for the money you spent. I also like how they have two self-serve stations of water, one regular and one is cucumber infused. 

Overall, great food and portion! Not so impressed with the ambient or service though."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on Saturday and this was the first time here. Service was excellent! Informative and helpful. We ordered the 2 specials to go and were out the door in 15 minutes.  The food was excellent. We had the lau lau and Hawaiian plates.  I was skeptical of the cabbage side dish but it was so full of flavor! Very nice surprise for a hole in the wall place inthe neighborhood."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for the past 15 years and I love everything about it -especially the Manapua and Poke! The flavors are true to real Hawaii and the staff makes you feel like family.  The Chicken Katsu and Belgolgi Beef are must tries as well"}
{"text":"I love this place don't get me wrong. Great food great environment but today's service sucked! The server Christy slow and non caring of the service she provides. She Brought out our food with only one set of utensils after 20minutes of waiting with cold food I went to the front and asked for the utensils the cashier and  very nicely gave it to me as the server turned around giving a look like I was going to get them. Never got an apology from the server or anything. People were in the restaurant cleaning their own tables and sitting at dirty ones and Christy was never to be found or any other busser. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"I had the beef stew, rice and macaroni salad and it tasted like my husband cooking! My daughter had the chicken curry. The food is awesome if you like Hawaii home style cooking."}
{"text":"I've been coming here 10 years now and Aloha never disappoints. Staff is always friendly and the food comes out in a timely manner. 

My first time here, I asked the gentleman at the counter the difference between sizings on a mini and a regular plate. He told me the mini is if you're hungry and the regular is if you're really hungry. Very true. Portions are generous. My go to order is a mini chicken katsu plate and sometimes I'll order a manapua on the side. 

Only downside is that they close earlier than most restaurants, so this spot is perfect for lunch."}
{"text":"Beware... everything is so ono it will surely break your mouth! Translation: hurry up and eat here. It's sooooo amazing!!"}
{"text":"The only thing I get here is the kalbi plate with kimchee which is the best kalbi ever in my opinion because the short ribs are cut thinly and not fatty and cooked perfectly. But everything else I've ever ordered is disappointing. I definitely do not like their BBQ chicken or their teriyaki sauce. The kimchee is just ok. Taste like it's from a jar. The macaroni salad is decent. All in all I would eat here a lot more often if other items on menu were up to par. 

The kalbi plate comes with white rice and either a scoop of macaroni salad or kimchee. The last time I went I got the usual kalbi plate and didn't want the rice bc I wanted to eat it with brown rice at home. So I ordered it without rice and asked if I could get kimchee and macaroni salad, but the cashier said I have to pay extra for the kimchee. I said can't it substitute for the rice? No he said. Oh well. No biggee. :/"}
{"text":"You should really have the courtesy to update your hours on Yelp to specify that you're going to be closed on a regular business day for a \"special event\".  I drove 5 miles out of my way to try Aloha Kitchen only to find a paper sign on the door stating it was closed for a private event. I can't tell you how HANGRY I am right now.  

While I'm a big time Hawaiian food fan, not sure I'll be giving this place a second chance after the inconvenience and disappointment."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place since I moved to Phoenix from Philadelphia. In 5 years their quality taste service and options have been impeccable. Never had a bad meal here...never in 5 years.. Everything is awesome! I specially love their bulgoki sandwich when I am not that hungry. Else...plates with coconut shrimp..teriyaki chicken..Chicken Katsu ... Or bulgoki...everything is spot on.
Must try!!!"}
{"text":"Would've gotten five stars if the girl hadn't had an attitude and asked me to tip her. I would've if she had a good attitude it's not like it was delivery."}
{"text":"This place is my go to for some Hawaiian food but all that changed yesterday when I found a piece of hair in my fuckin food! I felt so disgusted and totally lost my appetite! They fucked it up! I will never ever coming back to this place ever again!"}
{"text":"The food wasn't horrible, but as a Korean, if you're going to serve Kalbi (beef short ribs), it'd better not be stingy.  The Kalbi I had was sliced paper thin and not very meaty.  There was chicken katsu, and terriyaki with the plate, both not too bad.  The plate and a drink came out to 10, a little overpriced for lackluster fare."}
{"text":"Good Hawaiian cuisine at decent prices. We were able to beat the lunch rush so the line wasn't too bad and we didn't have to wait for seating. I ordered a loco moco which was pretty good, but nothing too special. The gravy was good and I loved the soft, sticky rice that they serve. The burger patty was okay and the eggs were eggs. This location is a little ways off the strip, but worth the visit if you want some home style food that you can't find on the strip."}
{"text":"Glad we found a nearby place to fulfill my chicken katsu cravings. Staff friendly and offer to go menu. Wish they had apple ice tea! Nothing fancy but portions are decent for what you pay for."}
{"text":"Incredible! Absolutely amazing experience here. My boyfriend is from Hawaii and he was in heaven after the first bite. Everything smelled amazing and tasted even better. I can't wait to come back next week for poki."}
{"text":"My first time at this joint and I will be coming back. My boyfriend ordered the adobo fried rice omelette and it was delicious, a little salty but I'm Filipino and adobo is always salty. I definitely want to try more of their food, when I came here I wasn't too hungry and just ordered a manapua and some fried Mochi balls; it made me reminisce about being in Hawaii. The mochi balls here reminded me of the ones I use to get down the street from my house in HI, sooooooooo ONO!

I wish I had a bigger appetite so I could've ordered the oxtail soup but I'll save that for next time."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with a hefty Island meal $9 combos I love getting the mix plate, teriyaki chicken, beef, and mahi mahi served with white rice and mac salad. Listening to some nice relaxing island reggae while you eat too makes you miss home"}
{"text":"This is our favorite Hawaiian BBQ place. We drive from Avondale to eat there. The food is delicious, and they give you a lot of food. We eat the Kalbi plate, and the Tempura Shrimp w Teriyaki chicken. Love all of it."}
{"text":"Another place to get rice in Vegas!! Just off the strip, but worth the drive if you're craving some rice.

Kali's and Katsura combo $7.59 - everything was good, but the pork could have been better.

The Adobo Omlette is pretty good here. I need to go back and try the tapsilog."}
{"text":"Adobo fried rice omlette!!!!!!!!!!! Enough said. 

Friendly good ppl. 

intersection: maryland/tropicana. not too far from strip at all. 

I will hit this place everytime when Im in vegas now."}
{"text":"Yum adobo fried rice omelette! You gotta try it at least once. Haven't seen it anywhere else. Have to make this my go to whenever I'm in vegas now."}
{"text":"I randomly checked this place out for lunch one day after being told good stuff about it. I definitely would say the food here doesn't disappoint. I got the bulkogi and chicken katsu platter. Great flavor and even though it was lunch time the wait time wasn't long. This is a small restaurant so can be hard to miss and fills up quick. Especially at lunch time. So when going for lunch get there early."}
{"text":"A friend turned me onto this place and I love her for it! 

- chill vibes
- huge portions! 
- ono grinds / delicious food
- reasonably priced
- friendly staff
- good island music

THE best loco moco I've ever had, hands down! And the adobo fried rice omelet was bomb!"}
{"text":"I will go back here for sure!!! The girls in the front were so nice!!! They said hello right when I walked in and acknowledged me... They made me feel comfortable... The chicken Katus was so good!!! Make sure you ask for the other sauce"}
{"text":"The food was good and plentiful people was good I love itbetter then l and l not sure if they have landl in Arizona lol"}
{"text":"I drove 20 minutes to get lunch here (pregnancy cravings) and I am so happy I did. Best chicken katsu I've ever had. HUGE portions. Great service and atmosphere. Makes me want to go back to Hawaii.

Also, someone commented if you like rice, order extra. I disagree. They give you two HUGE scoops. Definitely enough in my opinion."}
{"text":"Excellent food for cheap.  It's off the strip but well worth the drive.  They renovated the dining area."}
{"text":"Some good shit here! Can't really go wrong in any of their plates!"}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time . They were very busy on mothers day.  We tried several dishes starting with coconut shrimp.  The shrimp was a little salty and could have used more coconut.  The beef was like Jerry and very salty. The teriyaki chicken was overcooked and salty. Service was slow. Best part of the meal was the chocolate cake"}
{"text":"My favorite take-out! My usual is the kalbi ribs with a side of macaroni salad. YUM. I've gotten the Kalbi combo, Tempura plate and spam masubi. I usually call and pick up an order. I noticed when they originally opened on Charleston.. they had bigger portions, but they still have great food when you're feeling to lazy to cook :P"}
{"text":"local hawaiian food...cheap.  i liked the katsu with green curry.  off the strip.  kind of fattening.  i think there are a few locations in las vegas."}
{"text":"All my friends who have been here make it a point to make a stop here at least once while they're in Vegas. We came here on our way back home from Vegas. I kept hearing all these great things about their adobo fried rice omelet which sounded so intriguing! I like adobo, and I like omelets so that sounded like a win-win already. It's a pretty decent sized restaurant with another room in the back with more seats. Our group of 12 was able to push together seats and tables so we can all sit together. We ordered separately and they give you a number placard to put on your table. So we all ordered one by one and sat waiting at our table. 

Service: Pretty disappointing. The food started coming out at the same time, some dishes took longer than others but for the most part people who ordered the same item got theirs at the same time. Then it started to slow down and about 6 people had their food already but only 2 people were given forks. We had to constantly remind our server to bring out forks, etc. to us. After 10 more minutes almost all of us got our food except for one person... when everyone else who ordered the same exact dish already had theirs and was halfway through eating it by then. No joke, it took another 10-15 minutes for his dish to finally come out. I asked our server, Ana if they had forgotten about his dish to which she replied no. mm hmm, because it always takes about 30 minutes to make one more tapsilog right? We got the food with no explanation or even acknowledgment that it was late. After that whenever I needed something I went right up to the counter so I didn't have to wait. I would understand if the restaurant was packed, but at the time we were there it wasn't. 

Food: This is at least the good part. The food was good here. We ordered the adobo omelet which was excellent on both aspects. I like to think of it as adobo fried rice with a better presentation of the egg portion. Like I said, you can't go wrong with adobo & an omelet. I also ordered the Loco Moco, which was also good. I thought it was very similar to L&L's Loco Moco, but then again since I waited for everyone to get their food it was cold by the time I ate it- still good anyway. 


Since I base my ratings on my overall experience at a restaurant (service, food, & ambiance), I had to knock off stars for the service portion.  Hey, what can I say, service can make or break your experience am I right?  At least the food was good enough for me to come back again next time I'm in Vegas.  Maybe I'll try one of the other locations though instead and hope for a better time."}
{"text":"Great food. Awesome wings!"}
{"text":"second time here & although the food is ok, it doesn't compete w/back home in Cali...

one thing I noticed on today's visit is that their credit card machine prompts you for a \"tip\"...now don't get me wrong but I tip when appropriate not when a machine \"asks\" me...

last but not least they charged me $1.00 for chopped GREEN onions that I asked for but what I got were uncooked chopped BROWN onions & just tossed on top as an afterthought because they forgot..."}
{"text":"First stop as i arrived in vegas with two of my boys. Recommended by friends so we decided to give it a try and it didnt disappoint. 

Pros:
- Largeeeeeeeeeeeee portions! Enough to feed two people easily!
-Cheap price! Plates i saw went between $7- $9. 
- Try the Adobo fried rice omelet. Gigantic omelet that comes with pork adobo (wish they had chicken adobo) garlic fried rice i think, wrapped eggy goodness. Just be careful, it comes really hot so you might want it to cool down a bit
-Parking easy
- Plenty room to eat
-Quick and polite service

Cons:
-my only con was that they had a variety of hawaiian sun drinks but no pog! how are you going to be a hawaiian place with no pog! that klnda disappointed but not enough to knock out a star

Definitely will make this a routine of making this place my first place to hit up when i get to vegas. I shall see you again aloha kitchen!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place. Everytime we crave for malasadas...we buy it here. The only downside eventhough when call ahead to place an order for malasadas. I still have to wait long for my order...frustrating it is!"}
{"text":"Food was good, and is a nice clean place, however the decor is very touristy and not very local to Hawaii"}
{"text":"It's clean. That's my main thing no matter where I eat, if it isn't clean on the inside I'm not even gonna order. Now besides the cleanliness, it has wonderful customer service! Prices are great and their Spam Musubi is to die for fam like it's really amazing lol. Stop by man it's a dope spot to eat!"}
{"text":"Tired of paying lots of money for mediocre food? Well look no further. Home style hawaiian food, huge portions, for affordable pricing. I wanna thank Aloha Kitchen for saving my life during this weekend. The service and food was great. Lots of room and i also love the reggae atmosphere."}
{"text":"The reviews were super great for this restaurant and I agree. You want to eat here. I had the coconut shrimp and teriyaki chicken plate. It was so good and the price is reasonable! You will not leave the table hungry. And when I closed my eyes I thought I was in my favorite place on Maui. A big hug to the cook! I will be back. I can't wait to try something else to eat here.

My only negative is the staff began to spray and clean tables near me and I could smell the cleaner instead of my food. This is a big big turnoff for me. I don't want those chemicals in my air or food. I want to smell and taste my yummy dinner!

Get there early since this restaurant closes earlier in the evening. Parking is a little crowded, but be patient you'll find something."}
{"text":"I was skeptical about the food here then I had that adobo omelette and it was game over"}
{"text":"Aloha Kitchen is my go to every time I'm in town. Get the Adobo Fried Rice Omelette!! So. Worth. It."}
{"text":"I love their Adobo Fried Rice Omelet."}
{"text":"I first cam here almost 20 years ago. The interior looks ugraded and different but it has the same great food."}
{"text":"the food we ordered was all very good, only the fried saimin i didn't care too much for. i ordered fried mahi mahi but it definitely wasn't fried; it was in a egg, reminded me of meat chun. i was iffy when i saw my plate but it was very tasty, i liked it. it was not busy at all when we went in around 3 on a friday."}
{"text":"Spend our Christmas party at Aloha Kitchen and service was good. I love their barbecue and chicken katsu! The look of the restaurant was néw and modern. All and all the service was good."}
{"text":"This my first time here. the place is nice and clean...food is great going to make this my new spot to get late night food. The guy that ring my up was nice"}
{"text":"You will have a good tasting meal served by friendly people at a reasonable price if you decide to give this place a try.

The cafe itself is comfortable. The decor of the cafe is fun, but you're not going to accidentally forget you're not actually in Hawaii.

The servers are always friendly and prompt.

The quality of the dishes range from quite tasty (kalbi) to good enough (just about everything else). There are some Hawaiian restaurants with much better dishes at the same price point, but not in the immediate area.

Their kalbi is their stand out dish. Definitely worth it to go there just for that."}
{"text":"This is a MUST eat in Vegas! D-licious. Adobo fried rice omelet is UH-Mazing!"}
{"text":"Was very excited to try another Hawaiian place in the area other then L and L. I had heard Aloha is better then L and L so I was eager to check it out. When I stepped into the restaurant there was one person ahead of me standing in line. As she left I stepped up to the counter and saw a display model of what a plate of food from here looks like. I got excited even thou I noticed the scoop of Mac salad was on a skimpy side. Oh well, I stepped up , ordered my usual fave at a hawaiian place ,chicken katsu plate. Since I noticed the skimpy display of Mac salad I decided to order a extra scoop of Mac salad, because for me the Mac salad is CRUCIAL to enjoying this dish ( I can get fried chicken and rice pretty much anywhere). $2 extra for a extra scoop! Oh well I love the stuff.
As I am sitting waiting for my to go food to get ready, I observe the predicament one of the cashiers is in. They forgot to give the lady that was in front of me the right order. They hurry and call her to ask her to come back so they can give her the right items. About 10 min later she comes back and hands over the \"incorrect food.\" The cashier (with no gloves or anything) opens up all her food boxes and looks at them, then opens up the one they said she is suppose to have. We have 4 workers looking at the open boxes arguing with each other ( all while my food already ready sitting behind the counter getting cold). They finally agree and close the boxes and hand the lady back the SAME items they told her to bring back and said \" oh, never mind we didn't mess up.\", And just hand her back her bag. No apology for having to turn around and drive back to a restaurant for a mistake of a mistake. I'm sitting down watching this just thinking \" man, that gotta suck.\" As she leaves the cashier calls out my order and hands me my food. I ask for a side of gravy which which she charges me 25 cents for. I pay and get in my car eager to enjoy my food. I get home and open everything up...... And there's only one small scoop of Mac salad :(.
 Now this would not be a big deal, but  the Mac salad is the highlight of a Hawaiian dish for me. Plus since it seems like they have a habit of messing up orders, I will not be returning. The food was good but not so amazing that the service shortcomings can be ignored.  I will not rerun to Aloha, instead I will continue to got to L and L, where my order is always spot on, my Mac salad is plentiful and my gravy is free."}
{"text":"This is a local joint for a quick bite of meat and rice and you should give them a try, good food. They have good cake and cha sui bao too. I love the options of mini plates. Honestly the serving portion is too big in most of the restaurant in the valley for my petite size so I can order anything here and not feeling like I need to take the leftover home for the next day as I don't like to waste food. The restaurant is clean and the food arrived quickly and tasty.  I ordered the teriyaki chicken and hubby had the Katsu chicken.  Both dishes were excellent in flavor and taste. We will be back again please don't change anything We love you the way you are. :)"}
{"text":"This location is not too far from the Las Vegas strip.  We usually go here in the morning (or when we wake up after a long night of drinking) to give ourselves some energy for more drinking.  LOL

This location has gone through a few renovations.  They completely got rid of the Hawaiian decor and updated the restaurant to look more modern.  The colors are a bit too dark for my taste, but it looks nice.  

I usually order the Adobo Omelette.  This is big enough to feed 2-3 people, depending on how hungry you are.  I've never been able to finish it on my own.  Also, they've expanded their menu.  However, I was sadly disappointed when I tried to order the 'Oxtail Soup.'  It's on their menu, but they don't offer it at this location.  Boo.

We, recently, brought our friends here for the first time and they liked it!  


Negative:  After finishing up our brunch, I noticed a big cockroach on the ground.  Yuck!"}
{"text":"I decided to try this place for the first time tonight. When I went in, I told the kid that it was my first time there and asked him what he would recommend and what's popular. He took the time to tell me about all of the different dishes and patiently answered my questions. I finally chose the BBQ chicken dish. Absolutely amazingly. One of the best dishes I've ever eaten. The place had both amazing customer service and food. I would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"I went kind of late at night because it's when i got off work and I think that may have been where I went wrong, but the food was just not good. I got teriyaki beef and chicken with spam musubi. The beef was awkward I should've taken a pic of it. It had a crumbly kind of texture and the teriyaki sauce was really thick almost like fish sauce or jelly. The service wasn't bad the lady at the front was nice, but the food wasn't good at all, probably wouldn't ever come back."}
{"text":"If you want to celebrate life right with your friends after a week of Vegas; this is the spot. Y'all need to have one in Los Angeles for us!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite location. Every time I want Hawaiian food(which is pretty often to be honest), I always make my way here. Food is awesome and the staff is even better!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I have an addiction to their Kalbi ribs. They are just so delicious!! Kalbi with an order of lumpia make my sad days happier. Today I'm getting a double order. I should be happy in no time."}
{"text":"I had the kalua pig and laulau (Hawaiian plate), as well as a manapua.  The food was very good, but I thought it was a bit pricey.  Will still go again if I get the chance."}
{"text":"One hour before closing, they started cleaning. I don't mind at first but when \"Cheryl\" (her nametag) started shaking off dirt from door mat (which is dusty and has some wetness left on the floor yuck!) I started getting a bad hunch. After that, she went straight to counter to get my order---without washing her hands!! She proceeded to put spoon, fork and napkin on the tray! Let's be honest, I don't expect them to be super clean but when clearly her hands is full of dirt that she just shaked off, don't expect me to use the utensils that she just touched and definitely won't be wiping my lips with that napkin!! 

Instead of dining in, I took it to go. I didn't wait for them to start mopping with pinesol while a customer is eating since they were so in a hurry to close! 

Food and her co worker is nice. Cheryl is disgusting. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I only have one Yelp check in here, however I have been coming here for years. Ever since the first time I lived in the area 10 years ago.  There is something on the menu to satisfy whatever you may be craving.  If you don't want to stray too far from the beaten path then the Mix plate is a good option. Teriyaki chicken and beef, plus some Mahi. All of the plates come with rice and mac salad, which you should try if you have never had it at a Hawaiian spot. Here is a rundown of all the other goodies I have tried there.

Chicken Katsu - On par with the other Hawaiian places I have tried. Usually fairly crispy and not too fatty. The Katsu is offered in a number of different combo plates.

Kalua Pig - One of my favorite things on the menu. The meat is not very fatty at all, I am not a fan of really fatty meat. The pork is served on a bed of shredded cabbage which gives everything a nice crunch.

Chicken Curry - My favorite thing on the menu. This is a brown curry, a little more like Japanese curry than Thai. It comes in a soup container and is full of chicken and veggies. Pour it over the two scoops of rice and it makes the perfect cold weather meal.

Mahi Sandwich - Good for a light meal, I like that the fish is not fried. Served with fries and only a little over $5.

Adobo Fried Rice Omelette - A ton of fried rice inside a cocoon of egg. If you like omelettes and fried rice this will be a revelation. 

Kalbi Ribs - Plenty of meat on the ribs and the sauce is what you would expect, with just the right amount of sweetness.

Lumpia Shanghai - Little eggrolls stuffed full of pork and deep fried. If you have ever had them before you know how addicting they are.

Loco Moco - Eggs and gravy served over a hamburger patty and rice. The quintessential hangover meal. It's warm, filling, and just the right amount of greasy.

Word to the wise, make sure you pick up a menu to see what is in all of the combo plates. The menu on the wall over the register doesn't explain what is in the combo plates. They offer a lot of combos and most of the above items are included in at least some of the combinations."}
{"text":"Walked in to high school looking students running the restaurant. Took while to get the food. Ordered three different things and later was told, \"apologies, we ran out\". WHY didn't they check and post \"out of____\". Coconut cake was moist, delicious and $4. Ate the Chicken Teriyaki plate., was filling and good. This place was recently named on \"Diners, Drivers & Dine\" so that would explain the business. Guess that's a positive. May try again on different day."}
{"text":"I really wanted to enjoy Aloha Kitchen! However, after convincing friends to join me for breakfast here, we ended up feeling disappointed with the lackluster food. First of all, it was disappointing that they were out of pancakes. While we were looking forward to trying the macadamia nut pancakes, alas -- it was a goal unaccomplished. 

The adobo fried rice omelette was a letdown for me. It was a huge portion that I would suggest sharing with a buddy. My friend and I each got one and we were both only able to finish half. The fried rice was lacking in flavor. I was tempted to put a lot of Sriracha in it. I had one little chunk of adobo and small shreds but the protein was fairly absent in the dish. 

The Portuguese sausages were large slices and were pretty good. I also liked how the spam musubi had a good rice to musubi ratio. I detest rice being heavily packed into my musubi, so I was really glad that Aloha Kitchen did not do that. They also had a nice selection of the Aloha Sun drinks. 

I think I'd enjoy this place more if I was really hungry or recovering from a night out from heavy drinking. The experience was not up to par with what we desired. With more options out there that I would enjoy more, I unfortunately won't be going back to Aloha Kitchen."}
{"text":"This place is what it is!!! They may have made changes to the dining room,  but service hasn't changed!! Horrible!!! Rude, Rude & Rude!!! The food is always great with an extensive wait, but I'd pay for better service plus the food anytime!!! There are better places way better"}
{"text":"Really wanted to like this place after browsing through all the Yelp photos, but unfortunately, I left disappointed.

Maybe they were having a rough day, but the female employees made me feel very unwelcome and one seemed irritated as she was taking my order. I told her it would take a minute or two to figure out what I want, but she just nodded and proceeded to stare at me while I browsed the menu :-(

I ordered the Adobo Fried Rice Omelette, and requested an egg-white omelette at no extra charge. I sat down at a table and waited about 30 minutes until I finally got my order. I don't understand why it took so long! The place was not busy at all. I was even more disappointed with my order...it wasn't even an omelette. It was literally just an egg white, on top of the rice. The fried rice was just okay and lacking in flavor; I had to add some sriracha and soy sauce to it.

I was only in the Vegas area for vacation, but next time I'm there, I'll pass on this location and try one of the other three. Maybe I'll have a better dining experience and actually get my money's worth!"}
{"text":"Aloha is my go to spot when I am on campus. The student special you can't beat $5 you get a big plate of chicken teriyaki with rice and a drink. My personal favorite is the Kalbi combo for $10. Comes with kalbi ribs, chicken katsu, chicken teriyaki, with rice.

If you want to order any apps I'd recommend the limpia egg rolls. Make sure to ask for the spicy mustard to go with that too. It's a must."}
{"text":"Another heart attack city! Hawaiian food and I love it!"}
{"text":"This place is a good escape from the hustle of the vegas strip. Overall, the food is good. I've tried the Oxtail Soup, Adobo omelet and the local plate. 
All portions are very generous, and pricing is below $15. Good place to fulfill your Hawaiian comfort food fixing"}
{"text":"I love how tasty this place is!  I'm a huge fan of Hawaiian food and you can't really find too many authentic Hawaiian restaurants in the valley, but Aloha Kitchen definitely is as close as you're going to get!  They have a great simple menu and offer mini and plate sizes for the meals, which is great for lunch and dinner portions respectively.  I absolutely love their bulgogi!  They serve it in huge thin slabs of meat tho, so every time I order I ask them to kindly cut it up into pieces so that it's easier to eat.  
Also their macaroni salad is TO DIE FOR!  I promise you, you can't go wrong with ordering it!  The employees are very friendly and helpful.  I brought my coworker along for lunch one day and she never tried hawaiian food before, so the cashier was kind enough to walk her through the menu and offer the best suggestions on what her taste preferences are as well as what are the most popular items.  Great customer service!"}
{"text":"This place is great for seasoned veterans. You can use this as a \"off-strip\" down-time meal, fill-up before the drive/flight back, etc. 

I went to this place early Sunday morning before heading home. No wait, immediate service. Which was sooooo much better than waiting 1+hr. in line at the buffet. 

So in short eat here instead and you'll shave time off your trip home because you'll be on the road while everyone's still waiting in line at the buffet. I just shaved couple hrs. off your trip home. You're welcome."}
{"text":"Saw a friend post a pic of their adobo fried rice omelette so when I went to Viva over the weekend, I had to get one. 

So delicious!

My bf and family enjoyed their food too.  Open one in California!!!"}
{"text":"They're OK. I use to right them off completely because the quality of food never compared to back home, price, frequently got bad service, and prefered the other hawaiian place that was down the road towards harmon ave (which closed down awhile back).  But they slowly improved and earned my approval. prices are mid range. lots of seating, pretty good menu selection. good location. short walk between clasess for UNLV students."}
{"text":"Honestly, this place was just okay for Hawaiian food. I came here for a snack and shared the local plate with my daughter. I asked the girl at the front about the serving size and she said that the plates were \"huge.\" I automatically pictured how it would usually be at any other similar establishment. The girl at the front was friendly, but the the plate was kinda small...otherwise I would've ordered another plate. I also think the food was lacking in flavor. I wouldn't say it was bad, just on the plain side. Oh, and later that night I felt queasy-ish...so I think it might've been from eating here :/ On a brighter note, I didn't feel stuffed after eating here and I did just want a 'snack' anyway,  but I probably won't go back to this spot or any other Aloha location."}
{"text":"A good place to eat adobo omelet. Highly recommended. Price is right. You need to try this when you are in the area. Big serving... One order maybe food for 2 people.

Just recommend the management to improve the cleanliness of the restaurant and the bathroom to be more presentable."}
{"text":"I have been here twice. The first time I ordered the adobo fried rice omelette. It was really good. The only other time I have eaten that was at Babycakes. Aloha Kitchen's is just as good, but makes a better lunch. I would definitely order it again. 

The second time I ordered the Kalbi combo and my wife ordered the mix plate. Both were good, but I think I liked the mix plate just a little better than the Kalbi combo. 

Aloha Kitchen has an impressive menu, reasonable prices, and good food. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"In relationships, sometimes the call of duty includes trying new things, such as ethnic foods. Although some might not consider Hawaiian foods as being \"ethnic\" this picky eater certainly does. 

With all foreign foods my only requirement is to have what I like to call, \"distinguishable meats\". This means, if I ask if the chicken is all white meat and they say \"yes\", I expect as well as look forward to distinguishable white meat chicken. 

Perhaps in foreign lands, and on deserted islands \"white meat\" could potentially have various meanings? I'm not sure, just trying to wrap my brain around what part of the animal I had my lips wrapped around this afternoon..much to my disappointment, it was NOT white meat chicken served in their teriyake chicken dish. 

Most folks that have an eclectic pallet aren't particular when it comes to the shades and textures of their chicken (or even meat in general), but I'm huge on knowing or having an educated guess as to what I'm eating. 

My better half enjoyed the food so that made me happy to hear, but as for myself, a return trip will most likely not be in the cards. 

How disappointing, two less than par meals in a row.. 

Suggestion: Aloha Kitchen personnel, lets work on learning the menu and adjusting to what the \"main land\" considers white meat chicken."}
{"text":"coworkers and i used to ditch outta the office for a taste of the islands...
and here it was - Aloha Kitchen...

probably some of the Best Saimin in town... throw a little more chinese hot mustard in your broth and go to work... i sweat when i eat, so this saimin always clenses me... ha.

the food is good and the price is even better... hook it up."}
{"text":"Aloha Kitchen has yet to disappoint. My coworker introduced this to me for lunch, and oh my gosh, I couldn't be happier. 

The serving sizes are GIGANTIC! He and I often split the Mix #3 (I think) with teriyaki and katsu chicken. This is accompanied by two huge scoops of rice, and your choice of side (I always go with macaroni salad). To top it off, you get a slice of fruit. Definitely some bang for your buck happening here.

The other day, we tasted the pink guava cake, and it was quite tasty. There is a gelatin-type layer on the top, which is tricky, as I expected it to be more like marzipan. However, this is not a bad thing, Definitely a fun treat (and bonus, it's pretty).

Thanks Aloha for helping me break out of the Subway/Jimmy John's lunch rut I had been stuck in! I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"I was finally able to drop in Aloha Kitchen today with my daughter and her Hawaiian boyfriend and we weren't disappointed. 

The restaurant is little more than a little cafe but we went for the food, not ambiance. After perusing the menu over, I decided to get a mixed plate, which had Bulgolgi (they called it Bulkolgi), chicken katsu, sweet rice and choice of salad. I wanted to try the 'creamy tropical salad dressing' on the green salad, so my daughter and her beau went with the macaroni and potato salad. She ordered the charbroiled salmon but he, being Hawaiian, had to custom order and made a custom mixed plate of teriyaki chicken and J. R. Special. AK happily complied. 

Our lunches arrived in 12 minutes, hot from the fryer/char grill/flattop. The plates were literally overflowing with food. My katsu and Bulgolgi were excellent. The katsu was crunchy on the outside but oh so tender on the inside. I was worried that my Bulgolgi would be dry but it was tender and juicy as could be. The sweet rice was, well, sweet rice but good! I tried the entrees from the other plates and they were outstanding as well. 

The Mac/potato salad was good but the green salad was just so so. 

The owner stopped by our table to ask about our meals and we offered him a seat so he could tell us about the prep. AK makes all of their marinades, sauces and garnishes by hand. The only bottled products are the condiments offered at the condiment station, plus the soft drinks.

He stopped by later as we were finishing to check on our satisfaction. For those who gave negative feedback for service, I think AK has been listening. 

We will definitely return but with bigger appetites. Had to leave half my rice behind :-("}
{"text":"It's been a while since I visited this place. This is a very late review, maybe 3-4 years late but I cannot forget the goodness that is adobo fried rice omelette. Twice I've been there and that's all I've eaten so far. Very good, huge, and filling. Perfect adobo taste (not too sweet, sour, salty). For the price, it's well worth it. Clean and good vibe as always - standard with Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders in general. Maori people especially. I miss my BF in New Zealand. :( I'm gonna go cry now."}
{"text":"I ordered the mini plate, for \"lighter appetites.\"  The regular portion would be great to take home leftovers. I was glad I could replace the customary  scoop of rice w extra Mac salad. It was a slower afternoon so there was no wait to order and the food was plated and at my table quickly:). 

The place itself is laid back and a homey feel, perhaps because I was feeling nostalgic.  It was also clean and well organized; take out menus are readily accessible above the drink cooler filled with cans of lilikoi and guava.  A hutch stands in the corner with straws, napkins, plastic utensils, wooden chopsticks, along with Nori furikake rice seasoning, Sriacha  and BBQ sauce.  Packets of Asian mustard soy sauce are also neatly placed for the convenience of customers.

My plate hit the spot and can't beat the price.  Bargain prices for taste of the islands can't be beat.  Aloha Kitchen still serves up delicious food after over a decade and still keeps their prices wallet friendly."}
{"text":"Wow just wow. Chicken katsu was great and I recommend the mini portions if you don't have a huge appetite. I still took home leftovers."}
{"text":"Completely lives up to the reviews as an excellent and AUTHENTIC Hawaiian food experience.  Fast friendly service too!

YOU MUST TRY: Kahlua Pork (Wed & Sat Only), Ahi Poke, and a Spam Musubi."}
{"text":"Great food at a great price. Always enjoy stopping here for lunch to grab the teriyaki chicken and potato salad. Grab a guava can of juice as well!"}
{"text":"They have Manapua! The girl told us it's hit or miss on whether or not they have it, but we got lucky. I also got the Kalbi plate which was a bit overpriced and very fatty, but had some of the best flavor! Just a heads up - bring cash for a tip, their card machine doesn't let you add it on."}
{"text":"The food was great and made fresh to order! Best musubi I've ever eaten!! Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"I ordered mix plate #4. Delicious! Serving size could be enough to share for a lunch run but for dinner just right. Eating area is clean but seating can get tight when busy. Workers were nice and knowledgeable"}
{"text":"Teriyaki bowl is great, but I absolutely love the macaroni salad. It's amazing."}
{"text":"Definitely not impressed. Staff was nice. The food took a long time and was not fresh!! Rice was dried out and that's half the dish. The spam musubi was completely old and totally dried out.  I didn't even eat it. I left it no way could I eat that musubi. Overall save yourself the trip and eat somewhere else. This is vegas!!! There is so much competition why come to a place with a high price for extremely poor quality food. I won't make this mistake twice!! The owner obviously neglects this place!!"}
{"text":"As an expat Hawaii guy, my family still loves \"plate lunch\" kind of foods.  So although Aloha Kitchen does not have great food, it normally is a relatively decent and passable place for us to pick up some plates when we are craving plate lunches and are too lazy to cook ourselves.  But in my opinion, this place is slowly getting worse.  The slight price increases are understandable and that is not the problem.  The problem is that they hire all these young kids who are sometimes more interested in farting around than paying attention to business.  

So yesterday my wife and  daughter wanted plate lunch stuff so they called in the order and called me at work to go pick the food up.  My wife warned me that I should open each box to make absolutely sure that the order was correct, since the last three times they screwed something up.  So when I got there, the food was ready and already all packed up.  I wanted to check the boxes, but the girl said the order was all there and read the order back to me.  Since she said the order was all there, I took her word for it and took the boxes home.  Upon getting home, my wife opened up the boxes and two out of four of the boxes were wrong.  Yeah, the entrees were seemingly correct, but the salads and sides were all wrong.  Boy did my ass get chewed by my wife for being so stupid for trusting  those young dufess kids!!

Further, my wife ordered the hot wings for her meal and the wings were not hot wings -- they were more like honey glazed wings and my wife said that they either changed the recipe or made a mistake.  My daughter ordered the bulgoghi, and that order was correct but apparently the meat was over-soaked in the soy marinade and it was super salty, super dark, and the meat was disintegrating due to being marinated for too long.  The order for teri-chicken was OK, but the order for fried saimin was disappointing.  The menu and the history of this dish at this place (like 25+ years) says that one of the condiments on the noodles is slivered char siu (sweet red roast pork).  But there was no char siu in the dish, only slivered, old, left-over, over-marinated bulgoghi....maybe that is why our bulgoghi meal was not very good -- they had a lot of old, leftover, over-marinated meat so they gave it to us and used some of it on the fried saimin.

There have been many competitors to Aloha Kitchen open Hawaiian style plate lunch places but most, if not all of them have gone under.  But as a plate lunch expert and aficionado, I can tell you that a good plate lunch place will be a gold mine here.  Not only expat Hawaiians and lovers of plate lunch foods, but even the other people will love those kind of menu items.  The problem with the other places and Aloha Kitchen as well, is that the food is not that good, and the menu choices are not typical of authentic plate lunch choices.  I understand the issue of cost control and menu standardization, but menu choices can be increased by  changing the menu for different days of the week, or, having a new special of the day each day.

Oh well, what do I know?  I have only run about 30 large corporations and small businesses successfully, so my ideas and opinions must be worthless!"}
{"text":"I'm from Hawaii and this is your typical plate lunch place. The food is good the, the portions are decent, service is quick and friendly, and restaurant is clean. I love the kalbi ribs, they have a great marinade. My son eats the loco moco and my sister likes the beef stew. This is our default restaurant when we can't decide what to eat. Only thing I don't like is the cafeteria style dishes, Yuck!"}
{"text":"If you're passing by Vegas, this is a little gem just off the strip. 

The most popular item here is the Adobo Fried Rice omelet. They got 8 orders of it over the phone when I went in.. Call in if you wish :P Haven't tried anything else on the menu, will definitely have to check out some of their other items next time! But the adobo fried rice omelet might overrule my decision. It's good, try it (:

The upgraded the seating area and decor since I was here last. Looks good and the booths are comfy!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Aloha Kitchen for about 3 years now, and have always had great food and great service.  Their lumpia are awesome, all nice and crispy, and the pork shu mai are little dumplings from heaven, but sadly they stopped serving them at the Henderson location.  Pork Adobo may be one of my all-time favorite things to eat, and Aloha's is spot-on, so moist and tender!  The Kalua pig is fantastic, and so is the garlic chicken. The katsu is never greasy, and they don't skimp on the sauces. If you don't like mac salad don't worry, you can have kimchee instead! I actually used to go to L&L all the time, until a racist person working behind the counter discriminated against me because of the color of my skin, so I refuse to frequent their business again.  So I am glad I turned to Aloha Kitchen. The staff at Aloha is always nice and cheerful, and they actually bring you out your food!  I'm moving to Florida in June, and am definitely going to miss this place...:( If you like your Hawaiian food with more of a Filipino flair, and great service, then Aloha Kitchen is the place for you!  Mahalo!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for my bro-in-law's B.P. in Vegas.  The tapsilog, pork lau lau, adobo fried rice omelette, and chicken katsu are to die for.  Wish they had this back in So. Cal."}
{"text":"Food was ok, they basically just drown it with teriyaki sauce. Patricia was great though. 5/5 for her"}
{"text":"Always crave \"local food' no matter where I am.  I was hoping for an authentic experience and Aloha Kitchen did not disappoint!  The curry was chicken but it was ONO.  Even the rice and mac salad were on point!  Call ahead and your food will be conveniently packaged and ready to go!  Several locations around the Las Vegas area."}
{"text":"Came in here after work Tom the bartender was really cool and gave me players card that allowed me to get $10 free play after I played 20(thank you tom!) Paris the server was awesome really hooked it up on the customer service. This is my new spot after work."}
{"text":"Foods always spot on delicious, I frequent here multiple times a month and it never disappoints!  Friendly staff and Family run!!

Sometimes theres a bit of a line but, its well worth it!!"}
{"text":"Try the adobo fried rice omelette & garlic chicken!!! 

Would've been perfect but they were out of the banana macadamia pancakes by noon. Will definitely be back every time we come to Vegas"}
{"text":"I had the Mahi Mahi burger and I really liked that the fish was grilled and not deep fried. It was a tasty sandwich if you like Mahi Mahi and it's pronounced fish taste. 

The fries were cooked with tempura deep fry on top. It was a little much for me but still tasty.

My companion had the oxtail soup which was a large portion that included rice.

This is a nice lunch spot."}
{"text":"I have been a regular at the Aloha Decatur/Sahara location for many years now, but I decided to try your new location at Maryland/Windmill because it is very close to work for me. I was very impressed with the design and atmosphere of this location as well as the friendly and excellent customer service of Bryann. I see Bryann on occasion at the Decatur location and am happy to see him at the Maryland location as well! I will continue to visit both locations as both have convenient business hours and locations!"}
{"text":"They need more structure. Back of house is a MESS. No formed lines, no nothing. Front of house could use some work too. A family of 4 and 2 who ordered after me, got their food first. Mind you, it was just me by myself. Lol. One order. Completely unacceptable. This is just based off the wait time, cause God only knows how long until I get my food at this point."}
{"text":"bring it on!

if you're in vegas and want some post drunken food the next day, then try aloha kitchen! it get's really crowded especially during lunch time on saturday. wait time is probably 20-30 min to get your food. flavor wise, i prefer \"back home in lahaina\". first time i tried this place, my friends recommended the adobo fried rice omelette - huge portion and greasy. what do you expect? i usually get the tapsilog and lumpia shanghai on the side. the pork adobo wasn't bad and the katsu was okay. will definitely come back again (it's a tradition) and try other things on the menu! check out the picture i posted."}
{"text":"Almost as good as the islands and much better than those other Hawaiian fast food places.  Lau lau was delicious and so was the Kailua pork.  Prices are low for what you get.  Ambience is good for ordering at the counter type of place.  Definitely would come back."}
{"text":"Now, this place is a staple for students.  Located right by UNLV, when school is session the Aloha Kitchen is always packed when lunchtime rolls around.  However, students also don't have the most discerning of tastes.  The big draw here is the $3 chicken teriyaki 'bowl.'  It's basically just a few pieces of chicken teriyaki and some rice, and for $3 it's definitely a steal and when you're done you're not hungry anymore.  The thing is, it's not that good really.  The sauce is kind of bland and I've found the chicken to be fatty.  But, hey, what do you expect for $3?

They have a no-debit-card-under-$5 policy which is super annoying when you live off of plastic like I do.  I was forced to get some spring rolls that I didn't want once because I wasn't aware of this policy.  The good thing was that the spring rolls were better than the chicken bowl."}
{"text":"Every time I am in Vegas, I have to come here. I absolutely love the Adobo Fried Rice Omelette. I have even taken it as part of my carry-on luggage on several flights from Vegas to San Diego / LA. It's a huge omelette stuffed with adobo rice goodness.

I'm hungry just thinking about it. So so so good.

Tips: Call ahead if you're ordering to-go! Service when you're dining in is kinda slow so just be prepared. Lots of other food on the menu but I never want to try anything else."}
{"text":"This was an awesome place to go to right before leaving from our vegas trip! Service was great, food was great! They give you a loooot of food. I do wish i had gotten something besides the hawaiian plate because i dont like laulau. The meat that came with it was slightly dry but it was still good. My friends all tried different plates and they were very satisfied with their choices. I would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome and cheap, especially for the amount of food you get.
You have to get the chicken Katsu, best thing on the menu. 
The staff is very friendly and you can tell they love where they work. Keep up the good work guys, there is a reason why you have such a loyal clientele."}
{"text":"The food was yummy.  However they need to learn the meaning of Aloha. We had a party of 4 for late lunch/early dinner, my treat. I spent well over $100, including food to go which included banana pancakes, we wanted an extra syrup, they wanted to charge us an additional $1.08. I said to them \"that's not Aloha kine style.\" Do you think that was representative of Aloha? I don't. I revoke their name Aloha.  They forget that word of mouth or yelp is the advertisement. My suggestion, learn Aloha and live pono or change your name otherwise your business won't thrive."}
{"text":"Can you say, 'Plate Lunch'? 
This place is pretty close to alot of the small family-owned shops in hawaii and they even have Spam Musubi and Haupia!!!....for those familiar with the 'ono-licious grinds' of the islands....I would suggest the kalbi ribs which are always my fav!!!!
This was a flash-back for me!"}
{"text":"Ive been going here for 30years!!! Ray is awesome and the food is real!!! I love the salmon teriyaki and saiman but everything is great. Mauna pua on deck also. I crave to go here it puts all these other generic Hawaiian restaurants in the valley to shame with it authentic lunch plate taste. You can get lomi salmon and lau lau here as well. Make the tripp!!"}
{"text":"When I'm missing that island  feel and having cravings.  Aloha kitchen opened up a few months ago a few blocks from my house.  When I'm craving a musubi I go for the Aloha plate!  It comes with not just one! But two!  YES!! Two!!! 1 and 2!!! Musubi's!  And if that's not enough rice for you it also comes with a scoop of rice, Mac salad, teriyaki chicken, and teriyaki beef.  I think the teriyaki sauce is a bit much so I order it on the side.  I don't like my meat swimming in teriyaki sauce.  I enjoy dining because they play the best island music."}
{"text":"Cant say enough about how good this place is, i love japanese, korean, chinese food and the hawaiians just turn it into comfort food which i think is there niche'. aloha executes that theme perfect. dont need any white tablecloth places when your talking comfort food because its about comfort in the palate and stomach so this is the place where you get your food and happliy dont look up till its gone. not going to keep you coming back with the decorum but who cares about that anyway when its this good. ive had three trips and counting. two for the curri and chicken katsu. flavorfull and plentifull. and one for the lumpia side and fried saimin as the main course. i looked at the saimin and thought ok ill eat half of this and eat the other half later to minimize the damage. didnt work, it was too good so i ate it all...wish i could have had a nap so thats something to think about. cant imagine they make anything thats not great so i might just run through the whole menu except the masubi which hasnt been my thing at other places. bring it on!!!"}
{"text":"This place has been around for quite a long time.  The food is delicious.  I highly recommend the beef bulkogi.  The rice and teriyaki sauce is also good as is the macaroni/potato salad.  The manapua are popular with my kids but they mostly eat the doughy outside and leave the pork chunks in the middle on their plate.

The prices are really good and I like that they have free water and lemons sitting out on the counter.

The only icky part is that the walls are really dirty.  You sit at a table and there is splattering of food and other debris on the wall right next to you."}
{"text":"My guy friends from Hawaii raved about this place so much, that I finally had to join them and I haven't ever looked back since. This place is in a strip mall that most drive by without noticing. I love love pretty much everything from them. I will cry from time to time, let's be honest, monthly, when I can't get my hands on their Mac salad. Any other Hawaiian place in the valley isn't as legit as this place."}
{"text":"Of all their locations not one if my favorite they don't give as much as the others they are a bit slow and not so clean food is good not great and I wouldn't call it hawaiian food it's more like wannabe like Hawaiian food"}
{"text":"One day food is great the next time I go it's mediocre some days they give plenty others I walk out still hungry food ok most of the time but slow this one is super clean and friendly but really they need to hire real Hawaiians or People from Hawaiian to get the full experience prices high for the area and amount of food u get I recommend not getting the hamburger steak tastes like frozen patties but try the katsu and the tempura the last time I went I could squeeze out the oil it was pretty gross"}
{"text":"I'll give a 4 star. Yes we love their food but the third time we went for dinner half of my bulgogi is burnt."}
{"text":"I don't usually call in my order but since I didn't want to sit and wait I ordered my food on the phone. We got the Kabli combo & Teriyaki Burger. My order was ready to be picked up by the time I got to Aloha Kitchen. But when I got home we noticed the Teri burger is not a Teri burger but a plain cheeseburger. I'm disappointed because they're usually on point. Hopefully they'll the get the order the correct next time."}
{"text":"This place is the best food I could ask for.... I always order the Bulkogi Plate and the Potato Mac OMG!!!!!!!!! Love it the whole office always has to place their order!!!!! This place better never shut down!!!!!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars rating.

I really enjoy Aloha Kitchen. Glad they opened up one on my side of the town. They are located right off the 215 fwy, in the Starbucks and Chevron (?) plaza. I usually phone in my order for pick up. I like how they always verify their address just to make sure you're calling your desired location. They're accurate on their ETA and my orders are always correct. 
Their Teriyaki Chicken Bowl is only $3.99 but the portion is perfect for small eaters. Enough to satisfy your lunch/dinner. Spam Musubi ($1.99) is a perfect snack/side and so is their Macaroni Salad ($1.99). Prices are pretty low and you get a good portion for your order."}
{"text":"Soooo good!!! Aloha Kitchen has amazing Hawaiian food, friendly people, all in a cute little restaurant! It's a charming \"hole in the wall\" - in the best way! Try the teriyaki chicken - amazing! And their cakes are out-of-this-world. Yum! I'm drooling just thinking about my lunches there!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for 17 years, always delicious. Everything is so amazing....I was disappointed when I tried other Hawaiian places years ago since Aloha Kitchen sets the bar, so I gave up and will only eat Hawaiian food from here. Try the mix plate #4 with Teriyaki & Katsu chicken with the potato mac, BEST potato Mac of anywhere ever. Also the best mana pua, spam musubi, oriental chicken salad.. Just go already, you're tummy will be happy :)"}
{"text":"This is a great place to grab some lunch for UNLV students nearby. The place seemed small at first from the outside, but once you get in, they have an extension dining room. The cashier had a smile on her face and welcomed customers as they enter the door. The price is decent, and their food is delicious, considering how they cook it upon order. This place, can't be compared to L&L, though, but they had more distinctive items on their menu than the latter. I suggest to order the mix plate, which is very tasty if you love both meat and fish.

The only bad thing about here is that their water comes from the pitcher, not the soda dispensing machine, which hints they're getting it from the sink, and their glasses are all stacked up in one corner. You have to put yourself your own water, and once it runs out, the busboy took like 10 minutes to refill it. The place is frequented not only by students, but also by some ghetto looking thugs that act like they own the place. Some of the tables and chairs are dirty and full of food crumbs, and the busboy doesn't go out of the kitchen to clean them right away. The Aloha Kitchen on Sunset Road is smaller, but better in terms of service and no wannabe gangsters."}
{"text":"YUM. Seriously YUM. Thanks to Brandi L for introducing me to this fabulous strip mall find.The potato-macaroni salad alone is worth the trip to this spot. I adore the bulkogi but really, everything I have had here is very good. Stop by if you are ever in the area. In fact... I think I might do a pick up today!"}
{"text":"So delicious! My family has been coming here for years, and recently I got my husband hooked on it too. Our favorite is the coconut shrimp, and the potato mac."}
{"text":"I was welcome the minute I stepped in and lady was nice. Appreciate great customer service and lucky my visit with my brother showed me this place. Had no problem with food everything was delicious. We tried the wings and teriyaki salmon and beef. The rice is amazing too. I will return!!!"}
{"text":"It's more like 3.5 stars I'm giving to Aloha Kitchen. I don't have a lot of options for Hawaiian food where I live, so I had high expectations for Aloha Kitchen. While I thought the food was good, I still felt a bit disappointed. I shared the Local Plate (combination of teriyaki chicken, beef and 2 spam musubi) and Kalbi Combo (kalbi, katsu and chicken teriyaki). My favorites were the spam musubi and katsu. If I ever go again, I'll have to try their other specialties and hope I have a better food experience."}
{"text":"I really come here for one thing.  That's the Chicken Adobo omelette.   It's so huge it could feed an entire family.   I've tried the version at Babystacks and it just doesn't compare to this one.  This version is much more flavorful with also more meat than its competitor.   

So what is it?   Chicken Adobo is a staple Filipino dish consisting of a meat (chicken or pork) cooked in a soup/broth of soy sauce, vinegar, garlic, and rosemary and eaten over rice.  

The adobo omelette they serve here is just that wrapped up in a thin layer of egg and green scallion.   The food comes piping hot and if you came by yourself, prepare to have leftovers!

I've also tried the kalbi ribs w/ kimchee and spam musubi.  Average.   There are other places that do it better."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and never have a problem, the food and service is always great. Their kalbi combo is my favorite order, I definitely recommend it if you've never tried it."}
{"text":"I frequent visit Hawaii yearly. I miss there cultural food! I have to admit today was my first time coming here AND I absolutely loved the food! So tasty! The best sticky rice ever! My new place to go to now! :-)"}
{"text":"Kalbi ribs are on point .. Nice char and all around great flavor. If you love to eat with your hands and eat off the bone you would love them."}
{"text":"Cashier looked like drummer from Kapena!!! Awesome food, cooked fast and very tasty. If you're in a budget this is the place to hit up. Good sized portions enough fill your mouthwatering appetite. They have four locations all around Las Vegas. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"The Kalbi ribs are sooooo good! Also the lumpia was super delicious! Great food to grab and go plus it's not super expensive. I get this like once a week now because it's close to me and really good! I get the ribs with the white rice and Mac salad. They also have a bar and karaoke from what I understanding you want to eat in and they are open 24 hours! Who doesn't want some teriyaki chicken or kalbi ribs at 2am! I know I do!"}
{"text":"Owner was a great guy...gave me a free BBQ pork bun just to let me try! Food was delicious!!"}
{"text":"Ono!  Love the Hawaiian plate and Chicken Katsu!   Our new favorite in Arizona!   No need to go home to Hawaii any more (ok, ohana is one good reason)."}
{"text":"So I don't know if this is the same place that I had gone to when I was in high school, but if it is it's gotten a WHOLE lot better. I remember going to an Aloha Kitchen on Maryland Pkwy right where this one is, and then I remember eating crappy Hawaiian food that I thought we could easily make better and cheaper at home, and then getting violently sick from food poisoning. But after overcoming my previous fears, and starting off slow with 1 spam musubi to go and then building up to their combo plates with no violent aftermath, I've come to the conclusion that it is now safe to eat at this place. 

The food here is decent, not bad pricing for some things, and they get it right for the most part. Their mac salad is a little lacking in the taste department, but after being addicted to Fukuburger's mac salad nothing comes even close anymore. The kalbi ribs are quite tasty, and at a decent price at $7.99 for a plate. The spam musubi is okay, cheap and quite big for $1.99, but they put a weird sauce on it that is kind of like a watery teriyaki sauce that I could definitely do without, and I think they need to roast their seaweed wrapper a tiny bit more. 

Overall, it's decent food for the price, but I am looking forward to trying their breakfast specials and see if they measure up to the breakfasts we make at home. Also, I did not get food poisoning here so that is definitely a plus."}
{"text":"I think I've become addicted to their Pork Adobo... I can't get enough of it.. Also being located right behind my house is a big time enabler. Always fast and friendly service too. The mac salad is awesome as well as the spam masubi. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Best kalbi ribs in da valley. Their adobo fried rice is ono too."}
{"text":"Been coming here for over 10 years, amazing food quality food which never disappoints. The couple who run this place are incredibly friendly and have given this place a very family friendly feel.  The chicken katsu and beef bulgogi are our favorites and are unmatched anywhere in the valley."}
{"text":"Every time I go to Vegas I have to stop by aloha kitchen. It has the best adobo omelette. Nothing else compares, stop playing yourself and go grab one. I get two omelettes"}
{"text":"I used to love going to this location, now I will never go back due to the price increase and the fact that they charge for extra sauce and they told me I would get double meat on the Teriyaki beef plate and it was the same amount of meat that comes on a beef bowl for double the cost and had less rice on it too!

I have been going to Aloha Kitchen for nearly 10 years and will never go to another location in the Las Vegas or Henderson area 

Another thing, the Beef tasted like a very cheap cut of meat, and was barely edible"}
{"text":"Uncle is so nice. He just gives the best customer service and makes you feel at home. He is so amazing and the place runs so smooth whenever he is present. It's definitely different whenever he is not around, but otherwise this place is better than the other aloha kitchen!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty darn good but too much Styrofoam is being used. Styrofoam plates and cups. Plastic utensils. That stuff is lousy for the environment. It takes like bazillion years for it to get into the water system."}
{"text":"Mmm loco moco! Totally hit the spot since I had been craving Hawaiian food for months now (haven't been able to find a place in Philly). 

Since they have a pretty big menu, I want to try more!"}
{"text":"i got the adobo fried rice omlet after reading all the good reviews here and it was indeed tasty. my friend got the mixed plate and it was pretty good.  large portions. good mac salad (simple but critical).  

but deep fried shu mai??  no, no, oh for the love of God no..    that shouldn't even be legal. 

over all a nice place to have friendly staff hand you a spam musubi"}
{"text":"This place is off the strip, but I refused to go back to the Bay Area without bringing home their Adobo Fried Rice wrapped in an Omelette. So yummy!"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this place a week or two ago and LOVED IT! Everyone was nice and it was busier than we thought. Didn't take long to get our food. AHHH ITS SO GOOD!"}
{"text":"I was a regular there since they opened .... However they have had a lot of turnover in bartenders.... in my opinion there best are now gone.... however I kept returning .... so I went in on a Monday to game and get food..... I was told while I was gaming that I would get 50 bucks for playing 50 points ..... well that did not happen when I told the bartender he said oh well and he will look into it .....to make a long story short.... he never looked into it.....I will not be returning EVER....  and would tell people to stay away...... only one good bartender left on days......"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. Don't let the modest surroundings fool you, this place has bomb food. Quick, friendly service and no fuss seating. You place your order at the register, sit, and they will bring your order out to you. Yummy yummy...I will be back, aloha!"}
{"text":"As far as Hawaiian chains go this one is off the hook! This is the second location I've been to. I still love the Decater location its just more lively. But as far as the food goes.... its exactly the same! 

Normally I get the teriyaki combo plate, which is yummy as yummy can be. This time I got the pig and katsu combo plate. I loved the pig and the katsu was yummy too. The plate was huge two scoops of white rice, a scoop of their delicious macaroni salad. Which btw is sooooooooooooo yummy. I normally hate macaroni and potato salads from every where! This one is so yummmm you wish that there were two scoops of this instead of the rice!

Everyone is super sweet and helpful. I feel bad leaving my plates on the table for others to clean up though."}
{"text":"My boyfriend loves this place. I think the food is really salty, maybe it is my tastebuds, I don't salt food so I'm not used to it."}
{"text":"I got takeout from this Aloha Kitchen location last week. It was deliciously average, but I should've consulted Yelp before I ordered.. looks like the go to item here is the Adobo omelette.

Being from Hawaii, my standard for local grindz is pretty high.  I got the teri chicken tempura combo, and was disappointed with quality of tempura.  I will say that this might have something to do with the fact that I got an order to go, but it tasted a little like those Costco shrimp tempuras.

Teri chicken was delicious, not dry, and charbroiled well.  

Overall, it was a great deal for the price, and excellent vicinity to my meeting at UNLV.  I would go there again out of convenience."}
{"text":"This place is A-OK. I wanted to try the adobo omlette to see what the hype was all about but it did not live up to the hype if you ask me. I had to add more soy sauce and vinegar to the omlette for more flavor. I will come back again but I will definitely try something else."}
{"text":"The chicken katsu tasted rubbery, old, and the breading was horrible as if it was reheated. As an Asian from California and having tasted all kinds of Asian food from the Bay Area to Los Angeles, this place was one of the worse Hawaiian places I've ever tried. I'm sorry but how can you go wrong with chicken katsu? They also didn't have spam musubi. Overall, judging from most of the bad reviews I can conclude that Asians know best. If I was ordering Mexican food, Italian food, or any other ethnic food and I see a lot of bad reviews from people of that culture then I would be very weary of a place. This place isn't great, so I don't know why there are 4 1/2 stars. I should've read the reviews instead of basing it off of stars like I normally do, I guess I was too hungry to check this time. There was also hair in my rice."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Great Hawiian food... Loved taking our children to eat Hawiian and being able to experience the taste of Hawiian island food that their father grew up eating on the island. Customer service is amazing!!! Food outstanding!"}
{"text":"The saimen was so salty.  The owner came and gave an excuse about how the boiling process of the seaweed and fish is done. He wouldn't make things right.  Even offering a refund or boiled hot water to dilute it. Kids couldn't eat it. 


The garlic chicken was good, however."}
{"text":"Went here and ordered the kahlua pork. I should of sent it back immediately but suffered thru it. There was so much water on my dish that my rice and macaroni salad turned soupy. When I asked for teryaki sauce they charged me $.27 for it. The combo plate was not much better. Over $26.00 for \"slop\". Very disappointing. I will not return!"}
{"text":"My favorite is the teriyaki plate. More than enough delicious food. Their spam masubi is my favorite."}
{"text":"Everything is solid. Customer services triumphs over the other locations. I especially enjoy the student special with fried chicken and gravy on the side. 

I often called in order to go and they are always ready when I arrive. It can get busy around lunch so be mindful of the times, great minds think alike after all."}
{"text":"My favorite and only place I will go for Hawaiian BBQ out here. Their teriyaki chicken is really good. The sauce is sweet and tasty. I also like their katsu. Nice, crispy and crunchy. Portions are big. I'm usually satisfied with a mini plate, which comes with: a meat of your choice, one scoop of rice and a salad (tossed green salad or potato mac). Their potato mac is really good. Sprinkle some black pepper on it and you're golden. Sometimes they have spam musubi at the counter. Yum. And also, they have hawaiian soft drinks in the little fridge by the counter. My fav is the lilikoi (passionfruit) regular or iced tea. The ladies here are super friendly."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my meal here at Aloha Kitchen as it was the first meal i got when i landed and picked up my friends at their hotel. I was really excited about the adobo fried rice omelette. i read here that the customer service wasn't that great and it takes a long time to get your order but, for my group our ordering process was smooth and the cashiers were friendly and helpful. our order came very fast and the food was steaming hot so, maybe we lucked out or it could be the time of day we came (saturday around 12pm). 

Along with the adobo fried rice we also got a bunch of lunch places including korean short ribs, katsu and chicken. All the meats we had was very tender and cooked perfectly but, you should ask for the sauce on the side as they did drench the katsu in sauce. the Adobo fried rice omelette was pretty huge and i wish they drizzled some adobo sauce on top of the egg or added cheese.. maybe you can special order it? the shanghai lumpia left us a little disappointed however.

All in all the food was extremely good and they give you very large portions for how much you pay for your meal. The staff seem friendly and they slap j boog, common kings and many island raggae which was dope. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Ok.so first visual impression was a regular drop joint hopefully with a good underlining\" food\".I got there mix plate#2 with beef and chicken katsu w rice and macaroni salad.the chicken tasted like boneless fried chicken cutlets w a side of Louisiana style bbq sauce\" instead of katsu sauce,not good,the beef was borderline beef jerky, thinly sliced over sauced beef,some of it was tender,alot of burnt ends and grisly bites,with a copious amount of marinate.left a coating in my mouth,the rice was sticky and clumped apart,the macaroni salad wasn't bad but wasn't good,had to add pepper and there were chunks of russet patotos in it,that was first,and I really wanted the lau lau,but only on Saturdays.as well as kalua beef.I will go back to try the lau lau but not anytime soon.stay classy yelpers"}
{"text":"The plan was to get sandwiches at Capriottio's next door, but they were closed, so what's the next thing to sandwiches, meat and rice. 

Disclaimer: I was pretty out of it when we came here to eat (damn you vegas), so my memory might be a little off.

First impressions, typical hawaiian plate lunch place with the typical foods; spam, teri meats, kalua pork, etc. but they also had filipino food which is an added bonus. 

I got the adobo and katsu combo - the katsu was okay nothing special, but the adobo was decent, wished they gave more of the sauce. The only disappointment was the mac salad, it seems as if I was eating straight mayonnaise, no flavor. 

Best part of the meal they have Fruit Punch. Cheehee!"}
{"text":"This place has great value especially since it is close to the Las Vegas strip. 

I ordered Chicken Katsu ($8.49) and it came with macaroni salad and two scoops of rice. I was given tons of chicken katsu (16 pieces) and it was way more than the rice scoops they gave me. The chicken was really crispy. The macaroni salad was interesting. It looked like there were carrot pieces in there.

I would come back if I was a UNLV student!"}
{"text":"Possibly the best meal we have had in Las Vegas. Great, very reasonable prices, decent portions (just right), tasty food and service with a smile. I wish we had this type of restaurant in Houston, too."}
{"text":"Whenever we're in Vegas, we try to make sure to stop by this restaurant. It's been awhile since we've been back and so we decided to stop by yesterday and again this morning. We were greeted both days by Travis, I think that was his name? It was the name on our receipt. We came in today and he remembered our order. We just said we're probably going to order the same thing and he remembered our order from yesterday. It shows great customer service when people remember their customers. The service is excellent and the food is seriously so good. We ordered the adobo fried rice omelet, the macadamia nut pancakes, and 2 spam musubis, which was shared between me, my hubby, and our 20 month old toddler. Our son loves the food and couldn't stop eating. The macadamia nut pancakes were so fluffy and sweet and the adobo fried rice was so flavorful. We took the musubis to go for the drive home back to CA. Everything we got was under $20, which is less than what we usually pay for breakfast. This place is definitely worth the drive away from the strip for some good food, fast service, and super affordable prices."}
{"text":"Definitely  try this place. There meat and sauces are always on point. The sides are delicious. Far and between to find awesome Hawaiian BBQ."}
{"text":"So good! Was looking for something different for lunch with my mom and this place was the ticket! The fried wontons are amazing! I've never had any this good! Spam masubi, delicious. Chicken katsu and sweet and sour chicken - check!  I can't wait to try the kalua pig - only available on wednesdays and Saturdays."}
{"text":"I am in Love with Aloha Kitchen, my only complaint is they got rid of the Turon  (banana sweet egg rolls), but they brought them back. 

My favorite dishes are the kalbi ribs, BBQ chicken plate, the macadamia nut pancakes, hell everything is delicious. 

Can't go to any other imposter Hawaiian joint."}
{"text":"One word... Disappointed. This restaurant has been going down hill for yrs now. I was at their opening for their others stores across town. But this just really disappointed me. The food was edible, you could tell it was not fresh. I ordered sausage, so that was cooked as I ordered it. But the rice was old. Eggs were fresh, cant fake that one. Lol. There was this dessert karioka... O.M.G. Do NOT eat it, it was very old because it was hard and the inside was undescribable. Im giving a 3 star because the staff was friendly and they were willing to replace the karioka with spam musubi (i chose that cus i knew they have to cook it) and the bathrooms were decent. Prices were high for the quality of this dinner. So we will not be back. Ever. So sad."}
{"text":"I had my first loco moco here. What an awesome dish.

So close to UNLV and reasonably priced. I will always have a special place in my heart for Aloha Kitchen. Awww."}
{"text":"We stopped here because we heard it was amazing, the food and service was incredible! We will undoubtedly be back and this is now our favorite"}
{"text":"...and the Five stars are not only because we've known the owners, Ray and Lynn for 20 years...as well as grinding there for just as long.  The food is always island style...which means broke da mouth, bruddahs and sistahs.  And Aloha Kitchen is always the busiest food kiosk at the Annual March Arizona Aloha Festival, for the past 8-10 years I can recall.  (The Aloha Festival is now held at Tempe Town Lake.)  So if you cannot get out to Mesa to check 'em out there, you can stand in line at the upcoming Aloha Festival...you won't be disappointed!  There have been many Hawaiian food establishments that have come into the valley since, Ray and Lynn opened over 20 years ago.   and, there are lots of good reasons (on their menu) why they are still serving ono-licious Hawaiian style food...its da sticky rice, brah....naw only keeding....Its da food!  Try 'em!"}
{"text":"Went here on the request of a friend visiting the Las Vegas area. It was conveniently located close to the Strip/UNLV and since it was early on a Saturday (with most people hungover), there was plenty of parking and I'm pretty sure we were the first ones in. Our party ordered 3 different items: Loco Moco, Spam (I know I'm boring) and the Adobo Fried Rice Omelet. Portions were good for the price and they offered your typical Hawaiian drinks. I feel like the Adobo Fried Rice Omelet is just the rice, wrapped around the egg and am not too sure why people go crazy for it... because if I'm eating Adobo Fried Rice, I'm probably going to want a side of eggs anyway (and I think over easy would be better so the yolk gets on your rice). Maybe it's just another Vegas thing I don't really get (I said Earl of Sandwich was just ok too). Comfort food and great company is always good, so if you're nearby, it's worth checking out if you want cheap eats."}
{"text":"Enjoyed brunch here with my daughter here, love that they play reggae music!! Gives it a real Hawaiian feel!! I wish they played reggae everywhere I went!! Will be back!!"}
{"text":"The girl that was working here tonight earned aloha a 1 star tonight. Working in retail I know what it's like when customers come in the store close to closing. We came in at 9:30pm and I asked if I could get some sauce so we could eat here. She asked me if we could eat here for only a few minutes because they were closing in 10 minutes. I immediately asked her when they closed because the door said 10PM. We ate here anyways. Thanks for ruining my experience here."}
{"text":"Great prices, super nice and helpful service, lots of food! Chicken was good. Beef, not as much. Veggies were fresh. Will come back."}
{"text":"Since Aloha Specialties at the Cal was closed for renovations, we found this place.  
Good food and BIG portions!  It's a good alternative, definitely better than L&L."}
{"text":"Sadly, I'm on one those New Year's resolution deals, but I still have to treat myself once in awhile, and it's only  a hop, skip and jump for me to step into the front doors of Aloha Kitchen.    Every step I take into this place is another extra 5 minutes of cardio as I'm headed in for another gluttony of starches, and fried foods!   Right on bradda, time to feed the shrinking opu, 

I usually get the Kalbi, Loco Moco or Garlic chicken when I grind over here, but one of the employees ordered a Teri burger with fries,  and it's looked damn good. 
I have say it was good burger, and it was a great deal for around 5.00.    Perhaps, they should use a King's Hawaiian sweet bread bun, and another burger patty and call it the Opu buster or a Big Kahuna Burger (why not ripoff Quinton's Pulp Fiction hamburger)    

I notice Aloha Kitchen has their original manager running this place, and things are moving pretty fast in the kitchen, and food is still very good...maybe better.   The gravy for my Loco has better flavor, and service is now more consistent.

I wish they had a Won ton min with a couple BBQ stick special...what the heck, maybe they will start one soon.

Good job Aloha Kitchen.....only thing, I wish you made some Madasada."}
{"text":"First time here and they have great employees that are very friendly. Had the Hawaiian plate. Omg it was so good cant wait tell we go back again."}
{"text":"I've been to the Sahara location a number of times and this is my second time here at this branch. I love that they're playing Hawaiian music, makes me wanna go back to Hawaii. Loco moco, kalbi ribs and their spam musubi are my favorites."}
{"text":"I'm a pretty easy reviewer. I liked this place because it reminds me of the filipino joints in San Diego (Tita's, Conching's, etc). We were in Vegas for my birthday and the day we were leaving, we of course had the munchies. We came here before starting our long drive. I ordered the Loco Moco and it was crazy good! I tried a bite of the Adobo Fried Rice Omelete and that was just as good! The food hit the spot and I slept half the ride back home lol. 

Now, if you come here, dont expect anything fancy smanchy. The decor is Hawaiian, it's a quickie in and out joint - grab your food and go. Food is served on foam plates and you use plastic forks and spoons. If you can't handle that, then pssh, you're missing out on some good food! Put the $100k silverware away and try this place out. Sometimes the best foods in town are served on foam plates and must be eaten with plastic utensils. =D"}
{"text":"Walked in and the place was hotter then An oven. I think they were having Ac problems. Come to find out there was no issue and they have it set at 83 degrees! How can you eat with the place that hot. We ended up walking straight out!"}
{"text":"Kalbi plate never disappoints but wish the portion was bigger instead of those thin thin kalbi slices :/ the flavor is good and service is fast! Will be back when I'm hungry for Hawaiian food"}
{"text":"Four of us ordered saimin; two got wontons wth their noodles. The wontons in one bowl started to dissolve and in the other bowl were not cooked. The shrimp broth was tasteless. The cabbage was cooked just right though.
Now saimin is Japanese food but it has become a favorite of Hawaii nei, it is an appropriate dish for this restaurant."}
{"text":"I can't think of a reason to not give five.

The adobo omelet was omfg drooooll.  Fiance was not as impressed as I was, but definitely was worth all the hoo-rah and praising we had been hearing from our friends - a MUST try, at least once.  Ours did not come with any adobo sauce, I was going to ask for some but he insisted to try it on our next trip, as to not 'ruin' the flavor experience he was having.

I got the Kalbi combo, which is only, like, the best combo ever (L&L listen up!  You MUST make a combo like this), duh!  It comes with kalbi (a tiny piece :/), chicken teriyummy! (yeah! because I generally don't like beef teriyaki) and chicken katsu (which was so nice and thinly cut and extra crunchy!

Wanted to try some saimin after my girlfriend ordered it, especially since it was cold, but we couldn't let our first time be tainted with soup instead of the infamous adobo omelet, so I'll save that for next time.

Will definitely be back here again.  Our leftovers didn't even make it back to LA - it was THAT good.

They also have a Christmas buffet that makes us wish we were going to be in town - it literally makes me want to duplicate that here!  Oh oh oh and please fill in your Glendale/Eagle Rock zipcode on the sign in sheet up front and get this eatery into SoCal!!!"}
{"text":"Good authentic Hawaiian food. Just like hawaii. I love how it's a family owned restaurant and the good is to die for!"}
{"text":"The wait was sorta ridiculous, I waited over 30 minutes for my food. I don't think the wait was worth the quality of the food. The ordering system was really disorganized. The waitress didn't know who's number belong to each food. If you're looking for mediocre food with time to spare then this place is up your alley."}
{"text":"One of the best things about Aloha Kitchen is that it's perfect for those days that you feel like a homecooked meal, but don't have the time or just don't want to cook at home. Yesterday was one of those days, so I stopped by before class to grab some breakfast classics. Corned Beef Hash and Eggs. I also recommend the Adobo Fried Rice Omellette."}
{"text":"I found out about this place from one of my friends a few years ago and every Vegas trip since I've come here to eat. I used to work in an authentic Hawaiian restaurant run by Filipinos back home in Elk Grove and this totally reminded me of it from the food to the decorations.

Over my stay at my old work, I've learned to distinguish authentic quality hawaiian food vs lesser quality (L&L). I must say Aloha Kitchen is up there! The typical food choices you normally see at Hawaiian restaurants can be found here such as chicken katsu, teri beef, teri chicken, loco moco, pork lau lau, mac salad, spam musubi, etc. Aloha Kitchen also adds in some filipino dishes like Silogs and their famous Adobo Fried Rice omelette (my favorite).

The staff is really friendly and the interior is decorated with all things Hawaii. The food is always fresh and takes no more than 10 minutes to prepare. The dining area has numerous tables and can even accommodate large groups. I enjoyed the hawaiian license plates, surfboards, paintings, and other decor."}
{"text":"I haven't tried Hawaiian cuisine since I first went to Aloha Kitchen, but I have after, and I must say, this is the best Hawaiian food I have ever tasted. Try one of the combos, I like Mix Plate 3 and 4. They have really good macaroni salad that I usually get with the combo as well."}
{"text":"A little slice of the Pacific Rim, caught under the broiling heat of the Arizona sun.

It's exactly as Island should be: Fast, fatty, surrounded by rice, and served in a styrofoam container with a side of macaroni salad.  This is food that you should be eating on a beach after spending a morning playing in the ocean.  I had to settle on eating it on my patio after working in my garden but the food tasted just as good.

I rated it 5 stars, this is definitely food that deserves to be eaten.  But make no bones about it, if you hate island food, food from Korea, or macaroni salad.... this probably isn't going to change your mind.  It's comfort food for people who think flip-flops should be year round footwear."}
{"text":"Two words - ADOBO OMELETTE

Your life will be forever changed. Order for yourself or to share or whatever. :)  

They also have other stuff on their menu, such as, katsu chicken, adobo combo plate, spam msubi."}
{"text":"I like the chicken Katsu here, but not so much the beef teriyaki. Maybe because I'm used to chicken teriyaki. Overall they have a nice, welcoming staff, a family friendly environment, and good food portions at a nice price."}
{"text":"Adobo fried rice omelette?? Who thinks of this stuff?? Aloha Kitchen does! As soon as my plane touched down we were on our way to carb up with some good food at Aloha Kitchen! I've been here only one time prior to this trip, but that was back in 2007 and I wanted to make sure this place was still good! There menu offered plenty of standard Hawaiian food style things like loco mocos and spam musubis, but people come here for the adobo fried rice! When my plate finally arrived the smell was intoxicating and my mouth was instantly watering. The fried rice did not disappoint this hungry stomach! There was a lot of flavors, albeit a bit salty, but it wasn't too bad. If you've ever had adobo on its own with rice and loved it the adobo fried rice will make you happy.

Three stars only because I've honestly only tried one thing there. But I look forward to future trips when I make my way back to Vegas and try other things on the menu!"}
{"text":"Sure it's not the best but it works when im craving some Hawaiian/Filipino food instead of burgers or when I'm sick of eating Chipotle due to it's location by UNLV. If I wasn't at UNLV all day sometimes, I probably wouldn't come here. Doesn't taste super fresh or that flavorful but I gotta get my rice fix sometimes and can't exactly carry it all day with me from home.
I usually go for the student special terriyaki chicken, loco moco, spam musubi, chicken katsu, kalua pork or sometimes saimin. Prices are right, service is friendly and location is eh unless you're a UNLV student."}
{"text":"I'd love to give them a better rating but the service absolutely destroyed any redemption their food could have given them. The food was pretty good; I'll give them that. I ordered the mix plate #2 and sat down waiting for my order. My brother's food came first, no big deal. I went to order a fish sandwich to go for my wife so it wasn't just sitting there while I ate. Next, I saw what was likely my dish go to another table and several other customers being served before me. I knew something was wrong. I asked one of the employees if she could check on my order and just as I had suspected, they sent my order to another table. Ok cool. Fire that bad boy up as fast as you can. I waited another 10 minutes before food came and finally just asked them to wrap mine up to go since my brother was basically done by now. The girl brings me a mix plate #1 showing me the ticket with our order #6 on it. Only problem is that that is what my brother ordered. Not me. I said ok that's not what I ordered but I've waited this long just wrap that up and I'll take it instead. They finally get everything right my original order is wrapped up. Thank goodness. I asked for my to go order and it was the one I'd seen sitting under the counter for a few minutes. Honestly just a mess. I wish a manager or someone in charge would have recognized what happened because they would have been able to see how poorly the situation was handled. If the food was absolutely amazing I'd probably be back. Unfortunately for them there are other good Hawaiian places to eat at. Good luck and hopefully this doesn't happen often now that you've been on DDD."}
{"text":"This is a MUST when I come to Vegas! Their Adobo fried rice omelette is soooo good! Everyone was really nice & I love their need remodeled look"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for the last 10 years and this place has never disappointed me. I don't understand how but the consistency of flavor is exactly the same which is hard to find with some establishments. It's been remodeled over the years and currently has a very modern and clean atmosphere. There's a good amount of seating and the staff is always welcoming. 

I usually order the teriyaki chicken bowl which is amazing and their rice is always perfectly cooked. You also have to try the banana macadamia nut pancakes, trust me they're the most fluffy and moist delicious pancakes I've had in Vegas after trying them in Hawaii. I hope this restaurant continues to grow and keeps serving great food!"}
{"text":"Best Hawaiian food ever! We will be sure to come back next time we're in the area."}
{"text":"Aloha Kitchen. I would say my number one issue with you, is consistency. One day, everything is stellar and my food is A+. Then, the next day, the service is just ok, my chicken is dry and my lumpia is still sitting on the counter when I leave. 
I love this place, and it works when I want something island style, or a quick miso soup. But I have also gone and been so mad. 
A couple things I love- The BBQ chicken, the lumpia, the mac salad, the miso soup.
Not too fond of the teriyaki beef, or any of the pork. 
Overall I think they should be using a higher quality of meat and the textures wouldn't vary as much. 
Also, I know a lot of the staff is family and been there a very long time. But that doesn't give you the right to not smile or have good service. Especially when a solid half of the employees are wonderful. If you have a great experience once, it sets a tone. 
I always come back to this place, because its decent priced, not horrible for you, and convenient. I just wish they'd step it up a notch."}
{"text":"Got the Hawaii flavors great portions and reasonable prices. There are now renovating to revamp newer look. The service is fast and pleasant atmosphere."}
{"text":"When I was a REALLY little kid, my family used to get take-out from here all the time. Then 15 years ago, I became a vegetarian, some other stuff happened and for some reason we just stopped going. Had nothing to do with the establishment I suppose, other than that there were a few closer options for take-out and we didn't go out all that often. I remember distinctly that the Manapua was my absolute favorite thing here as well as eating their rice covered in their teriyaki sauce.

Now, 15 years later, I eat chicken and fish again...and one of my first cravings upon visiting my hometown was to come back and try this place again. Finally got to go recently, and I'm hooked. 

Everything here is delicious. Really, you can't go wrong. I ordered a combo (number 4 i think?) which was teriyaki chicken and bulkogi combo, which comes with salad and rice and an orange wedge. The bulkogi is a pretty awesome breaded fried chicken thing that comes with a unique tangy BBQ sauce. Delicious. The teriyaki chicken is fantastic. It is the epitome of what teriyaki chicken should be, with a distinct hawaiian flare. There are sometimes a few, lets call them \"less than desirable\" cuts of chicken in there, but it hardly matters when you're scarfing it down like I was.

The rice brought me back, and surprisingly, so did the salad. The salad has, well, I dont know what kind of dressing on it but its delicious. I hadn't at all thought about it before coming, but when I tasted it I was instantly transported back to my childhood.

The only \"bad\" thing Id say about this restaurant is that its really almost better to get it to-go. There is absolutely no added benefit, taste or temperature-wise, atmospherically or otherwise to dining in. In fact the to-go containers seem to keep your teriyaki sauce out of your salad a bit better than the styrofoam plates you get in-store. The environment inside is very back-to-basics, no frills. I have no problem with that at all, but given the option, I think Id rather get the food to-go and just eat at home while watching a movie or something.

Anyway, this is really very good food, and probably the best hawaiian food in Phoenix--at least as far as I know. A definite keeper and locale to frequent when Im in town."}
{"text":"Haha what a cool lil place. The location we went to even had a karaoke bar next door.

The food isn't too expensive. I think I had the Kabli plate which came with slices of korea kabli ribs, chicken katsu (fried chicken cutlet), and macaroni salad, white rice, and teriyaki chicken for 8-9 bucks.

Everything was pretty good, and the kalbi was seasoned properly but just overcooked as some of the pieces are quite crispy and charred black. It definitely filled me up for not too bad of a price. Tacky Hawaiian hut themed restaurant but if I lived in LV I could see picking up to go's on the way to work from here."}
{"text":"I always stop by here before I leave from Vegas! The adobe fried rice omelette is a must try! Huge portion and I never finish it but it makes a good second meal hehe. Such a good combo and always served hot/fresh !

I would also recommend the katsu and the corned beef hash!

Service is great - they greet you right away and there usually isn't a long line to order."}
{"text":"Its okay at best.

Food is average. I order the kalua pork with cabbage its ok. there wasn't much food or flavor. 

If your looking for hawaiian food do not come here.....

Ive been to hawaii many times..."}
{"text":"By 11:15am on a Saturday this place was already packed. I snagged the last table for myself and my friend (she uses a walker, so standing to eat was out of the question). She had the coconut shrimp and chicken plate and I had the Hawaiian plate with chicken long rice (2 stars), Kahlua pork (4 stars), rice (3 stars), and salmon civiche type side in a cup (2 stars). My friend said her meal was average and my plate was not as good as the food that I ate in Hawaii. 

There is almost no service here. There are pitchers of water and paper cups on the counter and the expectation is that you will get your own drink. An elderly gentleman does tote your food from the counter to your table. You are expected to clear your own table, locate a trash can to throw you stuff in. By the time we left, the line was out the door and no tables were available. 

The pork was reminiscent of \"pig in the pit\" meat I knew well from Tongan friends, but instead of real smoke flavor, it tasted like artificial smoke (leaving me with heartburn for a couple of hours). Parking is very tight. We will probably not return."}
{"text":"Love this little spot! They always have great food and service. Always hot and fresh. This place is always busy!"}
{"text":"Good quick lunch stop. I miss the teriyaki from Seattle. This is still not it,  but I was craving chicken and rice and it was cheap."}
{"text":"Hawaiian food.... my favorite food mmmmmm. Came here with my friends on a Vegas trip a few years ago and I have been hooked ever since! Best thing for sure is the Adobo Fried Rice Omelette. I've also gotten the spam musubi and loco moco.. All your normal Hawaiian favorites."}
{"text":"Hawaiian and Filipino foods. First, the adobo omelette !!! Very good!!! Adobo pork mixed with rice and then made into a huge omelette. Topsilog (marinated beef with garlic fried rice & 2 eggs. Portuguese sausilog is good too. Freshly cooked lumpia !! Yum yum!!! Good food and reasonable. Friendly staff with Hawaiian theme decor"}
{"text":"We came here for the Adobo Fried Rice Omelet.  The restaurant is spacious and clean.  You order the food and seat yourself. 

::Drink::
I got the Hawaiian Sun Guava Nectar.

::Food::
I've had better Spam Masubi but I did like the sauce.  The Corn Beef & Hash with three eggs (sunny side up) and three scoops of white rice were average.  We also got the Adobo Fried Rice Omelet which I didn't get to taste because I was full and wasn't satisfied with what I ate; I didn't want to eat anymore.  The Adobo Fried Rice is pork stewed in vinegar and soy sauce.  It has rice and it's wrapped in an egg Omelet.  Also, I barely saw any meat, mostly rice.  The portion was more than enough that two people can share it. 

:: Customer Service::
-The Cashier got my order wrong.  I think he was distracted by a phone order.  
-We didn't wait long for our food. 

::M's Notes::
-Parking lot
-Inside seating"}
{"text":"I live in Socal so everytime we make a trip out here to Vegas we come by to eat! I've been coming here for 4 years now & every visit never disappoints! 

We always get the Adobo Omelette & it's HUGE! 

They have 5 different locations now, hopefully they can expand to California"}
{"text":"my favorite hawaiian food around... flip back and forth between the mix plates (2 meats + rice + macaroni salad). ive ate some real deal hawaiian in maui and this spot is just as good and maybe even better. they grill over open fire and u can taste it with the chicken bc it has that char grill taste then they add teriyaki after on top of some
cabbage and rice... mmmm!! the katsu is always on point but the only thing i would change is the katsu sauce - thus the 4 star review. all in all, this place is bomb and i never leave hungry (big portions).  the bulgogi meat quality is also not top notch but the flavor is good. nomnomnom!!!"}
{"text":"I can't get enough of their manapua. Or, really, anything. The food here is delightful. I love the coconut shrimp, the chicken Katsu is mouth wateringly scrumptious, the bulgogi is always delicious... heck, even the salads (green or macaroni) are yummy. You'd be best served to arrive early if you want manapua... they run out from time to time. But really, that just gives me another excuse to come back.  All this for a reasonable price, to boot. Aloha Kitchen, I'm always happy to see you!"}
{"text":"Loved this place until I found this in my food last night. Sad day for me, hope you guys can get your act together."}
{"text":"Always a good experience food are great friendly stuff I wish I can eat everyday here highly recommended come and experience great"}
{"text":"Look for the Nello's Pizza sign when you go here. Otherwise, you won't see it from the road. 

Now, I love good Asian food and I've had all kinds. Except I'd never had Hawaiian food, so I thought I'd give it a try. 

Sadly, the only good food I had was the spicy Korean BBQ wings, which came out still hot, and the guava drink from a can. Don't get the saimin bowl. It is tasteless. 0/10 on the flavor scale. 

I was looking at the plate lunches of others and they look pretty bland. Maybe only come here if you enjoy a big lump of pork on your plate. It's just not for me. 

The guava cake and the coconut cream cake in the fridge look really good. Didn't get to try it because I'm such a tiny person."}
{"text":"This is my go to place if I'm craving Kalbi short ribs. By far this is the best place in Vegas to get Kalbi short ribs the way they make it back home in Hawaii. I always get the Kalbi combo because it comes with chicken Katsu and chicken teriyaki. I do opt for no skin on the chicken teriyaki because it is soft skin. I also am not a huge fan of macaroni salad, but I love kimchi. They let you have a side of kimchi instead of macaroni salad at no charge like other places!"}
{"text":"Go here for your Hawaiian food / filipino fix!  I always get the Adobo Omlett!! so good...but i have had Chicken Katsu from here and other food.  Def  a must if you are sick from the vegas buffets."}
{"text":"After a long weekend of partying, we decided to come here before heading back home. I've heard great things about Aloha and seen yummy pictures, but, personally, I didn't find it to be that impressive.

I ordered the teriyaki combo, which was probably a bad idea because the teriyaki sauce was WAY too thick and sweet for me. The plate, itself, was decently sized, but their meat section of the plate wasn't all that impressive. It came with chicken, beef, and pork with rice and macaroni salad. Half my plate was rice, a small scoop of macaroni, 1 palm sized chicken, 1 palm sized beef, and pieces of pork. Due to the overpowering sweetness of the teriyaki, I got kinda sick from it. Their portion of rice to meats wasn't balanced. Their sauce, not good for me.

My friends and I ordered the same thing-teriyaki combo, while everyone else got the loco moco. Again, the loco moco had  too much rice compared to the meat and egg. Maybe their adobo fried rice omlette is better. That's what I've seen from friend's posts. Shoulda gotten that maybe.

Overall, I wasn't too impressed with Aloha. I'd much rather go to L&L. I left unsatisfied, but full. I guess it got the job done. I wasn't hungry the whole 14 hour drive back home....Next time, I might try the adobo rice. *shrugs but I don't know."}
{"text":"Love this place there manapuas are to die for!!! Really reminds me of the islands! You won't be disappointed unless they run out of manapuas lol."}
{"text":"I prefer to order my food over the phone, and it really takes a little less than 10 minutes for the food to be ready. I find it weird that there are two areas to dine in yet everyone's seated in view of the counter. I wonder if people just aren't allowed to sit in the bigger room?

Anyway, my favorite is the kalbi plate. The sour kimchee obviously came from a jar (I forgot what the brand is) but I still enjoy it very much. I had the local plate before and I only liked the spam musubi. I also like their adobo omelette...sometimes. It can either be tasty or too dry and bland. 50/50. It's probably a good idea to ask for extra adobo sauce to guarantee flavor. 

I gave up on trying any other items on the menu because they never seem to have anything. No oxtail soup, no laulau, no bbq pork.. dang it! So I just go for the Kalbi plate or an adobo omelette if I feel like enjoying leftovers."}
{"text":"Back when I lived on the east coast, I was never really aware of how popular hawaiian food was. When I moved to the west coast, it was like discovering a new world. I had never heard of dishes like Loco Moco or Saimin, although I had heard of Spam Musubi. So when I first started visiting Vegas with my bf, he introduced me to this place. 

If you read my previous reviews, I get really excited about hold in the wall restaurants because they tend to have the best of the best. This is a really small restaurant located near the university so I figured it would be popular with students. They even have student lunch specials! It's one of those restaurants where you order at the register and you seat yourself. 

My bf really wanted the Loco Moco and recommended I try the Adobo Fried Rice. What he described to me was something I couldn't fathom--until I saw it with my own eyes. Chicken Adobo fried rice encased in an egg omelet?? Yes, please!!! Although our entree portions weren't as large as other places, I wasn't complaining. It was enough. 

I had high hopes for our food based on looks alone. Unfortunately, I was disappointed about the taste. I had to add loads of sriracha sauce to complement both dishes. 

Although it wasn't the worst experience I've had, I've found other hawaiian restaurants I'd rather visit since. If you haven't experienced Hawaiian food, you could try this place. But to be honest, I'd drive further to eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"(To correct Lindsey A.'s review of 5/6/17, they have 12 four top tables and 2 two top tables.)  The wall murals are colorful and and islandy.  These lovely people have been here for over 30 years, they must be doing something right!  Their food continues to be way above average, island flavor and more than fairly priced.  I can't believe it has been a year since we were back but in this terrible past year my wife had five surgeries and I two, ugh.  Came early (4pm) on a Saturday just to be sure they had not run out of Poke or their wonderful Kalua Pig!!!  A year might have gone by but their quality and consistency has remained.  I certainly will return more often, Mahalo and Aloha :)"}
{"text":"I lived in Hawaii (on Oahu & Maui) for 11 years (1981-92), and on the US Mainland, it's difficult to find truly delicious Hawaiian cuisine.  ALOHA KITCHEN solves that problem, superbly.

My favorite dish is Kalua Pig, and I must say that it tasted every bit as good here, as it did in the islands.  It turns out that this is a family-owned company, and the folks there are from Hawaii also, so they KNOW how Hawaiian dishes are supposed to taste.

If you've never enjoyed the flavor of the islands, you're in for a very special treat, and I heartily urge you to stop by sometime, to give their many menu items a true sampling.

It's my belief that you will enjoy dining there, as much as I do."}

{"text":"Came across Aloha Kitchen while driving around the airport and glad I did. The pork adobo fried rice omelette was delicious! Tasted like my dad's food and brought back so many memories of being a little girl."}
{"text":"This location is closer to the strip which is a plus, however, I feel like the one on Decatur had more extra stuff. I'm pretty sure I was able to get halo-halo at the one on Decatur.

Anyway, I ordered my usual adobo omelet and it was just as good as I remembered. I love eating it with some sriracha. Since it is massive in size, I had leftovers for lunch the next two days. The portions are large, which is always enjoyable. You get your monies worth!"}
{"text":"Amazing, every single time you go there ! The lunch plates are heavenly ! The potato mac is TO DIE FOR ! My favorite is the Katsu Chicken & Teriyaki Chicken . Their homemade Katsu sauce is simply delicious"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here and was blown away by the quality and portion size!! Had the Mac banana pancakes with Portuguese sausage fried rice and eggs.. Awesome!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a Chicken Katsu via Postmates and they forgot to include the sauce -- that makes for the most important part of the dish since it's utterly dry and inedible without it. They refused to fix the issue."}
{"text":"I love Hawaiian food and only found this place thanks to Yelp.  I have driven by hundreds of times and didn't know it was there.  

The service was awesome, I asked for a little help and the wonderful lady behind the counter offered tons of advice.  She was incredibly passionate about the food and raved that they had the best food around.  I instantly loved the place and I hadn't even taken a bite yet...

I ordered the Bulkogi thanks to the yelpers reviews and they were right!  The fresh grilled taste and perfect korean bbq marinade put this over the top!  Also their mac-potato salad was amazing with hot sauce!  My wife ordered the laulau pork place and the lady was right, this was some of the best I'd ever had.  One suggestion:  ask for terriyaki sauce or something to go with the pork.  Though it was perfectly cooked and seasoned, it needed something to put it over the top.  

I'm going back to try the short ribs ASAP!  Check this place out!  A gem!"}
{"text":"My kids love it here. We come here at least 3 times a month. The staff is friendly and the food is really yummy!"}
{"text":"Located on Sunset right across the street from the Galleria Mall. It sits in the same parking lot as Sunset Station.

Parking directly in front of restaurant and easy access.

Came for late night Hawaiian food right before they closed at 10pm. I was thinking no way they'll have my kalbi right before close. But yeah my sistas got me covered.
The kalbi was perfectly cooked, flavor great and of course my Mac salad, 2 scoops of rice and side of kimchee. Everything was perfect except the kimchee was medium cuz I'm not crazy about the kimchee here. But gotta have it. I LOVE KIMCHEE

Service was fast and friendly island style.

I only wish they were open later. Prices really reasonable."}
{"text":"service is best at this location and the food quality is surprisingly great! i normally don't comment on quick bite places, but this aloha is the one to go to in vegas. the one near decatur used to the spot to go to back when i was in high school over ten years back, but their service and food quality, alongside sanitation and health have depleted and i avoid going there now because it just feels unclean. 

this location however, is a dramatic difference because the place maintains cleanliness and quality! my boyfriend and i have gotten to-go a handful of times including today with a classic local plate and his corned beef and hash. we opened it just now and the quality is great yet again! i'm so shocked that aloha delivered such consistency because the past few late nights we have been to this location, even in late hours, the food is nice and warm and overall, the presentation is consistently great!"}
{"text":"WOW. I was amazed that there was a bar connected to the restaurant. Although, I did not get to go the \"happening\" karoake bar, I still think that the bar is an awesome addition. Get a few mai-tais, beers, and then when ur good to go.. go next door for good old hawaiian food.

Bf told me to get adobo fried rice. I didn't listen since I was in the mood for some fried chicken katsu and kahlua pig. I was not impressed with kahlua pig and had hoped for a slightly bigger serving of fried chicken goodness. The kahlua pig was a bit salty and hard to eat but the katsu made up for it. 

I did manage to sneak about 3/4s of a spam musubi in. That was delicious.. The sauce was nice, sweet and thick. 

Fortunately, the bf decided to order the adobo fried rice omelette to take home. I ate it the next day and grumbled my regrets about the previous night's decision.

ADOBO FRIED RICE OMELETTE IS A MUST. Fried rice mixed with delicious adobo pork. The pieces of pork was delicious and slightly reminded me of carnitas. The rice was wrapped in a thin layer of egg, kinda like a wrap. 

FREAKIN' DELICIOUS. If it was good the next morning, I can only imagine how delicious it would have been fresh!"}
{"text":"Boooooo!!! This place has no customer service and food us not that great! This is somewhere you go to if you want da taste of hawaiian food but don't expect quality or to get your stomach full. Staff don't look happy working there."}
{"text":"Wonderful customer service here! If your looking for good local food in Las Vegas, come to aloha kitchen! All the local food you can get in Hawaii, but in Vegas. And guess what they have \"fruit punch\" and Hawaiian sun drinks!!"}
{"text":"Being from Maui, Me and my boyfriend come here all the time to get a little taste of home. After tonight I hate to say I won't be back here. Coming in to pick up my order, Your \"manager\" Emily was unprofessional complaining about a higher up that was calling to speak to her. She then charged me over 4$ for extra spam in my saimin which is fine.. if I actually got extra spam. When I called to discuss it she had an awful attitude with me and asked me what I wanted her to do about it.  Poor customer service. You lost a loyal customer tonight"}
{"text":"Have heard SO much positive buzz about this place! I recently went for lunch with Son #1 who pretty much eats anything that's in front of him. We both ordered the chicken katsu, and we both agreed it was just okay. Basically breaded and fried (and dry) chicken that was served with BBQ sauce, white rice and a really good potato-macaroni salad. The place was packed, and the service was pleasant and efficient. I'll probably make a return visit and try something else...just as long as I can get some of that potato-mac to go with!"}
{"text":"Here it is short & sweet.......GARLIC CHICKEN with xtra gravy!!!! It is the best I have had. Portions are generous and prices are reasonable. The adobo can be on the salty side sometimes but is good. The Adobo Fried Rice Omelet though is........... OOOOOOONNNNNNOOOO!!!! You have to try for yourself. They only get 4 stars cuz they no can make up da mind where dey goin build in CA. Hurry Up!!!!"}
{"text":"Came in at 10:15p dine in, ordered 6 saimin, I'm not too sure if they had only one cook, but been waiting for about 45min, when we got our saimin the noodles was still clumpy and rubbery. I'm trying to give the staff the benefit of the doubt that they were short staff and that they had only one cook, but the service was really bad. They were more concentrating on their take out orders, the people that ordered take out had their food first before we had ours?"}
{"text":"Very simply, the owner needs to hire another employee at least. On a Sunday at lunch there was only one waitress for the entire restaurant and she was busing tables and doing all sorts of other stuff too. Felt bad for her the whole time. 

There were only two other employees in the whole building I think so they couldn't really help when the kitchen was getting killed too. 

This led to slow food times and lack of water, which is tough when it's 110 degrees outside haha. They have a water station to self-serve (suspicious) but it was always  empty anyway. 

To put it into perspective, when my group got there, there was only one other table of people (had like 12 people though) and every other table had dirty dishes on it. 

I love Hawaiian food too and the food here was respectable. But \"PAY THE MAN.\""}
{"text":"Started going to Aloha Kitchen to watch some Golden Knights games, since this location has a bar.  The three times I've gone, the bar was pretty packed.  Pretty much all of the machines were being played.  The nice thing is there are 4 tables to one side of the bar.  Since everyone else was playing a machine, we usually had these tables all to ourselves.  Kind of felt like our very own VIP area.  Staff is very friendly and attentive.  You can order food from the bar and someone from inside the restaurant will drop it off inside.  The food and drinks are both very reasonably priced.  In my opinion, there are no wrong choices when it comes to order food.  Everything is pretty delicious!!"}
{"text":"I really like the saimin here also the service is great. They are open 24 hours and Also it is affordable, highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Dousing everything in overly sweetened teriyaki sauce is not okay. 

Nothing too spectacular here. Nothing that left the urge for me to go back and eat some more of their food. This place is close to UNLV and is convenient for a quick-fix meal. 

The boyfriend loves this place. He gets the Local Plate (beef and chicken teriyaki, 2 spam masubis and macaroni salad with a side of rice) and it usually lasts him the whole day. Big portions. I guess this is alright when you're super duper hungry. 

I do like their loco moco, though. I feel like I'm committing a health crime when I'm eating this. A large plate of rice with a hamburger patty and eggs smothered in brown gravy. It's a very hearty dish and gets kind of old when halfway through the plate. 

I like the fact that you can call ahead your order if it's for to-go. When I call while leaving UNLV, my food is almost always ready by the time I get there. Again, convenient."}
{"text":"There was hair in my boyfriend's rice. On top of that my chicken katsu looked old..I ordered for here and the cashier put it in to go boxes. Not once did I order \"to go\" ..so all my food was bunched up. 
I finished two strips before I threw it away. I wasn't expecting much because it's Arizona..but this is super low quality."}
{"text":"Been coming here since it opened, and I have never been disappointed.  Great food at a great price.  The best Hawaiian food you will ever find.  Everything on the menu is delicious.  If I could, I would give it 6 stars."}
{"text":"I can never end a weekend in Vegas without having breakfast at this location. The famous adobo fried rice is a must order. It's breakfast lunch and dinner \"rolled\" in to 1, literally. It has fried rice in pork adobo all wrapped up in a large omelet blanket.! 

I'm a lau-lau addict.. and what can I say?? The lau-lau here is pretty darn authentic. I can eat this all day! The pork is buttery.... Moist (not my favorite word to use.. but definitely a perfect word to describe it)..

The question is.. when will they open one in Los Angeles???"}
{"text":"A friend heard we were going to Vegas for the weekend and recommended that we hit this place up and try the adobo fried rice omelette and Jesus H Christ I'm glad he did! I'd say one of the many highlights of the weekend was this dish. Great remedy for that long night of clubbing and drinking. 

I took the advice of fellow yelpers and asked for extra adobo sauce with my omelette but didn't really need it. I thought they made mine perfect. It wasn't dry or anything and tasted like real home cooked adobo. GREASY! Though, I can probably state that the 5 stars are based solely on the adobo fried rice omelette. My friends ordered the katsu and teriyaki chicken plates, and they didn't seem too impressed....they kept taking scoops at my omelette D= even though there was more than enough for one person..I'd say it can feed 2 people.

This is one thing that I cant phrase with \"what happens in vegas, stays in vegas\" because I hope this place opens a location in San Diego...I made that perfectly clear on their suggestions sheet up front hahaha"}
{"text":"What can be said about this place that isn't good? I love Aloha Kitchen! It's probably my favorite Hawaiian joint in town.

I've never had anything bad from Aloha, but these are my favorites:

Corned Beef and Hash w/ 2 Eggs - $4.99
Tapsilog w/ 2 Eggs - $4.99 (This usually runs out in the afternoon)
Aloha Plate (Teriyaki Chicken and Beef w/ Chicken Katsu) - $7.59
Manapua - $1.50
Lumpia Shanghai - $2.99

As long as this place is open, I'll be a valued customer. Friendly and quick service, along with tasty food."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Aloha Kitchen. Bryson is the friendliest cashier, always recommending new foods to try."}
{"text":"When I went to Las Vegas for my bachelorette party, I had one main objective:  get some hawaiian food.

It wasn't until my last day there when I got that chance.  I ordered the adobo fried rice and it wasn't as good as I had previously remembered.  It was ultra greasy, and it had a weird scent.  I don't like being let down when it comes to food, especially when I look forward to it for so long."}
{"text":"Be advised they only have one high chair and one booster seat. If you have multiple babies or toddlers you may want to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Food is fairly authentic island food... it is OK, nothing fantastic. Then again, not much island food is 'fantastic' anyway.

If you love island food, go here. If not, you are not missing anything."}
{"text":"Best Hawaiian local food I've had in AZ so far.  Teri chicken tastes legit and the rice is perfect.

Would love to see Korean chicken on the menu."}
{"text":"So happy to find an amazing Hawaiian restaurant! We had the mini teriyaki chicken plate, the daily special, and the guava cake. They were absolutely delicious and we will definitely be coming back. Always happy to support a local business. The employees were very friendly and welcoming. The food was fresh, and served to us very quickly. The atmosphere is laid back and  clean. I'm still savoring that last piece of teriyaki chicken..."}
{"text":"Tried something new instead of the usual buffets in Vegas.

Venue: large venue with more than enough seating. Located near UNLV in one of their universities plazas. 

Food: I ordered the Mahi-Mahi plate. The fish was battered with egg, which I think is very different; came with macaroni salad and two scoops of rice which is standard. It came out to be about 8.50 for the plate. Overall, the food was good, but I had better. Apparently, people were raving about this place: hawiiaan bbq with a hint of Filipino kick. Most of my friends got the fried rice adobo, which was HUGE! 

Service: Took awhile for the food to come out, but nice older man. He was serving the food and taking orders. Kind-hearted by the way he was approaching the customers.

Verdict: Good, but I wouldn't rave about to Vegas rats."}
{"text":"Great place to eat some damn good food, came here after a long day of studying and couldn't wait to sink my teeth into some great authentic Hawaiian food."}
{"text":"Amazing food and even better prices. Love this place.. definitely a hole in the wall. Try the combo plate.. you'll be taking a hefty and happy nap afterwards"}
{"text":"From the outside, and even in, you would never know what to expect. Minimal decor, food is served on styrofoam plates, plastic silverware, not a large menu. None of this matters. The food is delicious. I had the bulkogi and teriyaki plate. It came with a choice of salad or macaroni potato salad, and served with rice. The meat was flavorful and the sauce was excellent. I inhaled everything and was tempted to order more. There's a reason they've been around for twenty some years."}
{"text":"Adobo Rice Omelette is okay. That's probably the best menu item. Don't get the Chinese Pork Rice Omelette... definitely not a good combination. 

I'm mostly writing this review because their service (whether it's 10AM on a Monday or not) was super ridiculous. I don't know how much those two employees care about their job, but don't jip us our white rice from our $8 COMBINATION PLATTER because \"we didn't ask for rice when we ordered.\" UHHH, it's a freaking $8 combo platter, we better get rice with it. 

And the employees that morning were also trying to charge my friend $1.60 for a to-go water cup, but decided to giver her a break. :| Whaaaack. 

Definitely forgettable. Same thing as L&L just worse service."}
{"text":"I spent 4 years in Hawaii, eating plate lunches and spam musubi almost every day. The chain hawaiian bbq places are ok, some are even good, but Aloha Kitchen takes the cake! It's one of the east side's best kept secrets. I went in on a busy saturday and ordered my staple: kalbi short ribs, all rice and a spam musubi. Both were fantastic! it reminded me of grabbing a plate lunch before heading to the beach. This place is tucked away in a random strip mall, next to a pizza joint, but it's worth the hunt and the drive. They have full size plates and mini plates, for those with smaller appetites. And, unlike the chain hawaiian places, they have REAL Hawaiian food: lomi lomi salmon, kahlua pig, manapua, stuff like that. This place gets a big thumbs up from me!



Head to the east size for a real taste of the islands!

Oh, and on every 1st and 3rd saturday they have a Hawaiian music \"store.\" A guy comes in with hundreds of old school and new music from every Hawaiian band/singer you can imagine! Hapa, Braddah Iz, Keali'i Reichel, Sistah Robi, Na Leo Pilimehana, and tons more!"}
{"text":"When I'm hungry and I want a full meal and I'm broke, this is the place to go.

I usually get the beef teriyaki or chicken teriyaki bowl, which isn't so bad. What makes this place distinct is their sauce, which can be a bit much. Their sauce is almost, if not all, on their food items on the menu. Even the spam Nadine! Their rice is a hit or miss- sometimes it's completely WET and UNDERCOOKED. It's gross."}
{"text":"One word \"Yummy\".  I wanted some musubi and my husband said let's go to Aloha Kitchen.  They didn't have Musubi so I ordered mocoloco instead.  It was soooo yummy! And my husband ordered Mix plate #2 which is Bulkogi and Chicken Katsu combination.  Wow their portion was so huge we are ordering mini plates next time.  But sadly we finished it all.  It was just so good.  We left Aloha Kitchen overly stuffed and very satisfied.  And their waitress was very friendly and way hard working.  She's cleaning the tables, taking orders, greeting every one with a smile.  I wasn't a big fan of their decor but who cares when their food is this good.  I would have given them 5 stars if they had Musubi."}
{"text":"Great Hawaiian fast-food joint! Located inside California Hotel on the 2nd floor, this place is diamond in the rough. It's inexpensive and food is better than most Hawaiian joints like L&L. It fails to get the last star due to being crowded and it's located all the way in downtown Vegas, which is out of my way."}
{"text":"The teriyaki chicken and mac salad are amazing!!!! I also ordered the saimin and I really enjoyed it. We tried two of the combination plates and everything was really good. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We ordered our company lunch last week and it was a hit. Having share a little island grub with my coworkers was pretty cool. They agreed to try something new and now we will be having luau lunches every now and then."}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss. Sometimes the food is fantastic, but sometimes it is inedible. I never know what to expect. When the food is good, it is really good, but literally half the time the chicken is chewy and terribly cut. If they were consistent, they'd be one of the best local places in the East  Valley."}
{"text":"OK so I've been coming here for years. Lived here for over 6 years and love eating all the Ono grinds here.  But today.  I'm over it l.  The service was crap!!!  This stupid young girl working behind the counter should be away from people.  So much for customer service."}
{"text":"Great food don't get me wrong only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because the music choice in here doesn't match the scenery or the food style. I expect to hear some Hawaiian jams in a Hawaiian restaurant not Mariah Carey that's all. But I love your guys food. But then you guys played some boyz to men so you guys gained one star now your get 3 stars but I love the food. The Kalbi ribs is action tho."}
{"text":"This is a great place. Staff is very helpful and attentive. The food is unbelievable. You will definitely love this place!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  Small hole in the wall type of Hawaiian place with the best food!  They serve a lot of it as well.  I can't get enough of the potato/mac salad and love the coconut shrimp.  Warning Saturdays are BUSY!! however, more authentic Hawaiian food.  If you get there early enough you can get Spam Musabi.  The Manapua seems to be a favorite, especially with the kids.  Super friendly people work here.  The decor is not much to look at but the place is clean.  Makes you feel like your in Hawaii!  Minus the tropical breezes, wonderful beaches and cooler temps."}
{"text":"Some days it's good and some days they seem stingy with the portions of food in the plates, I guess it all depends but it's good just depending on how they prep and pack your plate."}
{"text":"I'm not going to pretend to know what authentic Hawaiian food is supposed to taste like but my ex-boyfriend is from there and says this place is the real deal. He use to take me to eat here all the time and I loved it. So when I had a luau I knew I had to come here for some manapua and beef sticks. Aloha kitchen did not disappoint. I placed a large order of both and everything was delish and went smoothly."}
{"text":"Being from Hawaii visiting Nevada, I'm sorry home state, but this place definitely defeats home Hawaii food.  Taste is on point, portions is alot....... And as always much much cheaper than back home at Hawaii. Good job guys, keep Hawaii food rolling."}
{"text":"I love Hawaiian food! Their food here is very good! I like their macaroni and their seafood option is good too. The most you'll spend on food is about 10.00 dollars depending on what you get."}
{"text":"I love the adobo fried rice!! It's YUMMIE! I also love the garlic chicken which I add egg. Heart attack! anyways. this place is awesome. But if you really like it at nite. go to the one on decatur. 
This service is friendly and great people eating there also."}
{"text":"No Vegas trip is complete without a visit to Aloha Kitchen.  And that's because of the Adobo Fried Rice Omelet!   There are several Aloha Kitchens in LV, all of them off-the-strip.  Unfortunately this particular location is not open late nite for those drunken meals (if you want late-night Aloha Kitchen goodness, go to the Aloha Kitchen & Bar on Decatur). 

But we didn't mind our last visit since we came here for brunch.  This location is by UNLV and has 2 dining rooms.  At this location, you place your order at the counter and they give you a # to bring to your table in the dining room next door. 

Of course I went with the Adobo Fried Rice Omelet, which is always heaven. Shredded chicken adobo mixed with classic fried rice, wrapped in a scrambled egg.  My bf went with a Loco Moco and an order of siamin and we shared our dishes.  Even though BF and I were sharing 3 meals, we still didn't finish everything.  The portions here are big which is great, cuz you can pack the rest as leftovers to satisfy later cravings.  There are other Filipino and Hawaiian favorites on the menu too such as spam musibi, lumpia shanghai, chicken katsu, teriyaki chicken, and mahi mahi.   

Highly recommended as the food is always on point and the service is so nice.  They truly do treat you like Ohana!"}
{"text":"My friends, who are of a certain nationality that sorta kinda rhymes with pinot grigio, raved about this place when we were in Vegas. So when presented with a choice of grabbing some quick food from either Earl's Sandwiches or trying something new like Aloha Kitchen, I decided for the latter. Reminiscent of the Aloha Kitchen back home in the San Gabriel Valley (Los Angeles for you non-626 people), the place gives off more of a neighborhood restaurant than anything else.  The restaurant is pretty inconspicuously located off the Las Vegas Strip in a Las Vegas Strip... mall. 

I ordered the loco moco (ehhh they aite) and the others ordered the adobo omelette and a few other items. The adobo omelette was good but a bit salty for me. Probably the best part of the meal were the banana macadamia pancakes. Those were out of this world and I don't even like pancakes.

Not too bad of a place. I'd tag along if the friends wanted to come back. Otherwise I'd stick with walking to Planet Hollywood to get a Fat Tuesday with a side of Chipotle burrito or Earl's Sandwich."}
{"text":"They have decent food although the rice is always soggy, which I can't stand.   Ok food, a little pricey.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"One of the hotspots for people visiting Vegas. A great bang for your buck and it's really delicious. Be aware that their lines can get backed up with large crowds coming in during lunch and dinner time. It's self serve with water, utensils, and condiments on the side. Would definitely recommend checking this place out when you can. Get the Adobo fried rice omelette!"}
{"text":"Well one member of my family liked it another hated it. I've had better. I will keep looking for my Hawaiian spot. Some concerns were the Chicken Katsu was dry. They didn't have Short ribs. They also didn't have a family style menu to order enough for a family. I had to 3 plates. Service was nice. I would probably not go back though."}
{"text":"I have been to the Charleston location for both Karaoke and lunch.  I do think the food here is okay.

My co-workers told me about this location.  The one co-worker is from HI.  Every HIn bbq restaurant I like, he doesn't.  And yet he says Aloha Kitchen is really good.  Again, we have different tastes and likes in food.

I have been craving a McDonald's HI breakfast which consists of either spam or Portuguese sausage, eggs and rice.  Unfortunately, that option is unavailable everywhere else.  Because Aloha Kitchen is 24-hours and it was on my way to work, I figured I would stop in to pickup musubis.

When I got there, I wasn't sure which door to go into and not realizing it, I walked into the bar.  Super dark in there.  But just in case its your kinda thing, they have machines around the bar for you to enjoy a plate of food and drinks.  

Since it was Friday and most people were out of the office today, I decided to buy a few extra for may co-workers.  I ordered 2 of each - spam musubis @ $2.75 while the Portuguese and teriyaki chicken musubis are $3 a piece.  

After hitting all the red lights getting to the office. I did the cordial thing which was to serve the musubis first and wouldn't you know it, the two chicken ones went first.  Now, I just thought that since Vegas is the 9th Island, that everyone has at least heard of a musubi.  Wrong! So I had to explain to two of my co-workers what it was. Ah, they didn't seem enthusiastic as my other co-worker who had just moved from HI. So I have know idea what they thought of it.  Hope they didn't throw it away. 

So I finally get to my desk and feast on the Portuguese musubi. I was surprised at the amount of rice that was in it.  It was the perfect amount, where normally, other establishments have way too much rice. And because of the well portioned amount, I was able to enjoy the flavor of the Portuguese sausage and the teriyaki sauce they drizzled on it.  It was so good and because I wasn't full on the rice,, I ate the spam musubi.  

It was so good that the one I was able to bring home to my husband, even he really enjoyed it.  My co-worker from HI, well, he's going to be sure to stop there tomorrow to pickup a couple for his wife and kids.

So that's it, I just wanted to rave about their musubis.  

I'll be making it a point to get up earlier to head to Aloha Kitchen for breakfast as often as I can."}
{"text":"Worse place ever after this visit, my wife and I like this place we been visiting Aloha Kitchen for the last 10 years and today February 10th 2018 decided in eating Hawaiian food and went to Aloha Kitchen she ordered her favorite pork simen and my self my favorite curry chicken. And a customer next to us we're telling us the bad service they were having and we're a bit upset the way the owner treated the cashier after a request the customer had his food was a bit spicy and was asking for more rice to cut down the heat and the owner said their not full filling the request it comes spicy just the way it's on the board and the cook yields he's not doing such request, this is what the customer were explaining to us when the owner over heard the complaint and started yelling at the customer and the argument kept going and we were sitting right in the middle of them I kindly asked to be a bit professional and don't treat your customers like this in front of us we came to have a pleasant meal and the owner kept screaming at the customer and I advice her if she did that one more time I'll be asking for a refund she replied \"Go get your DAM money\" so I did has we we're  walking out she called my wife a fat Ass! So my wife replied gave her a little taste of her own medicine. We will never go to this place. Aloha Kitchen list a few customers this day."}
{"text":"price-wise, the mixed plates here are roughly the same price you'd pay at any other hawaiian joint, BUT i really wasn't very impressed. i'd go back to try the saimin, but the teriyaki chicken and katsu were really unremarkable, the mac/potato salad was drowning in mayo, and i felt really sick afterward. 
i really wanted to like this place - and maybe i will love the saimin. but i just don't think it's as good as everyone raves about - not worth the drive for me. and did i mention they don't even have spam musubi here? what the! that probably killed it for me, right there."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good, the service was alright I felt pretty rushed when I was trying to order. The lady at the register wasn't  very welcoming. If you want poke or musubi they sell it on certain days. If you're looking for some great Polynesian food go to Ono's Hawaiian BBQ. It's the closest you'll get here in Arizona besides Aloha Fest in March at Tempe Town Lake."}
{"text":"Being born and raised in Hawaii this place isn't so great.   The only items that are good are the saimin, fried saimin, and the guava cake.  Everything else is pretty horrible including the spam musubi! They don't even cook the spam, it's like they sliced it out of can and placed it in the musubi mold. If you want real hawaiian food head over to Paradise Hawaiian BBQ at ASU!! They even serve meat jun there."}
{"text":"Love Aloha Kitchen! I've been to this particular location many times and been coming here for years. Have also tried their other locations. Wish this spot offered Poke more on a regular basis. But we come here mainly for their Adobo Fried Rice Omelette. A must try!!! Nothing like it anywhere, even my homemade one doesn't compare cuz I can't make my egg wrap the way theirs does. I also like their spam musubi and their kalua pork. Can't go wrong with those. They used to have the best fried chicken which took and extra 10-15 min to get but they no longer have it. Hoping they'll bring it back one day."}
{"text":"This place is legitimate Hawaiian food. DOES NOT TASTE LIKE THE KNOCK OFF PLACES! Laulau taste like its homemade and not like dirt!!! Strongly suggested if you need some Hawaiian food in your life!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended by one of my coworkers.  I have to say they have THE best Adobo Fried Rice Omelet (a.k.a. Adobo Burrito) ever! Our first time there, we didn't know what to expect so we ordered 3!  OMG, we had no idea that the portion were huge!!  You can seriously feed a whole family with one.  Highly recommended and price is very reasonable.  It's an all time favorite and definitely worth the trip whenever your in Vegas."}
{"text":"Disgusting. Had chicken  teriyaki plate. Rice was soggy and tasted old, macaroni salad was not even close to local hawaiian food chains in Hawaii, and chicken was bbq but didn't have any teriyaki sauce, very bland and flavorless. Way over priced for this nasty meal. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"This food is so good I ate it before I could take a
Picture - lol. The teriyaki chicken and coconut shrimp is so good. The macaroni potato salad is really terrific."}
{"text":"Never been to Aloha Kitchen, so I wanted to check it out. Mediocre customer service. The food was okay. Probably not going to come back here, ever. Just going to stick to Island Flavor. They give you much bigger portions and it's a lot more flavorful."}
{"text":"I used to come here often and food was good.  But I am so surprised that this place still has such good reviews.  Ate here today and had combo #4.  It was terrible.  Teriyaki chicken was quite burnt and hard.  Beef was tough and bland.  Mac salad wasn't bad and rice was soft, so at least that earned it one star.  Don't think I will be back :("}
{"text":"This place is absolutely delicious! The portions are pretty big. I can rarely finish a plate on my own. The half sizes are enough to get me full. The staff is very friendly as well. They get pretty busy during lunch hour so get there early!"}
{"text":"The counter help was outstanding. The food was great too. Plenty Aloha in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Arrived there at 4:45 with my daughter they wouldn't serve us because they close at 5. Considering I've worked customer service I'm pretty sure they aren't suppose to close til 5. Lol"}
{"text":"Love this place especially the bbq chicken
Affordable and huge servings. Recently just moved to my new apartment complex and noticed that a new aloha kitchen will be opening near by"}
{"text":"Always a great time enjoying my food. The music genre is always on point and the food is tasty. I love bringing new people here because I get them hooked"}
{"text":"Okay I just finished my food !!! The best lumpia !!! I'm so happy I stopped by!  Cool employees great food . My new go to place !"}
{"text":"I love this place I wish they had one by my house in the Centennial Hills area I hope they'll be building one out here soon"}
{"text":"I wouldn't go out of my way to experience the food and the service here, but the price-quality ratio of the student special and the convenient location next to UNLV make this place one of the to-go places for UNLV students in this neighborhood.

Aloha Kitchen has a student special for under $8, which includes a Chicken Teriyaki bowl and rice. There is a good amount of meat, and the portion size is more than sufficient for lunch. 
Customers order at the counter and can receive their food there, or they can order and get the food brought to them. The place is a little dirty, and the staff mess up the orders sometimes, but they do try their best in getting the orders out fast, which is pretty important for students who need to get back to class in time.

Overall, this may be one of the most affordable and most convenient lunch locations that are in walking distance to UNLV, although the service can be a little confused."}
{"text":"Polite, friendly, helpful service. Restrooms & tables were clean. I enjoyed the food. Will return!"}
{"text":"Mmmmm....everything I've had here has been excellent!  My first visit I had the Korean Beef Bulgogi plate, small size for $5.  It was just as I remembered it from a place in Ocean Beach I used to go to, closed for years.  Instead of the usual mac salad, they serve a potato/mac mixture.  I liked it, my daughter didn't.  We tried one of the manapuas I heard people rave about but it wasn't my thang.  Probably an acquired taste so if you like them, I heard they were good here.  

Other visits I've had the salmon plate and the pork specials offered only on Wednesdays and Saturdays.  One time I had a shrimp plate that was the best one yet!  Yesterday it was the \"Hawaiian Plate\" with Kalua Pig and Cabbage, Lomi Salmon (like Ceviche with salmon), and the mac salad mix.  It was supposed to come with Chicken Long Rice but they were out of it so I just had white rice.  Everything was wonderful.  My daughter wasn't real hungry so she just got the 2 teriyaki beef stick side dish, $2.25, which I had a taste of.  Real good!  My plate was so big I took half home for leftovers.  

I will keep coming back here!"}
{"text":"My colleague and I dropped by here couple of days ago for lunch. I was wanting to come back because I really liked the Chicken wings from the first time.

Not in the best neighborhood but the parking is plentiful. The service is friendly from the cashier to the serving of your food. The bathroom is clean.

Food is reasonably priced. You order at the counter, they give you a number and then your food is brought to you. 

There is something on the menu to satisfy whatever you may be craving and these comes with rice or mac.
 
We had the Loco Moco- Eggs and gravy served over a hamburger patty and rice. You have a choice of how you want the eggs done. It is very filling and the portion size was huge but too much rice compared to the meat. I thought the flavor was bland.
 
They also sell Hawaiian Sun drinks to quench your thirst."}
{"text":"Very nice place and customer service is nice. Food test so good and affordable price."}
{"text":"The banana pancakes are to die for. Another favorite is the adobo rice.
 This place was shown to us by one of our friends in November 2014 when we visited vegas. We came back for new year's weekend. I have to say the food is good. My son is a picky eater but he gobbled up the banana pancakes and the adobo rice. We will definitely be coming back for more banana pancakes and adobo rice wrapped in scrambled egg"}
{"text":"I've been going here since the mid 90's or earlier. 
Great food, decent prices always friendly employees and the place is nearly always pretty busy.
I drive a long way round trip on the weekends to go here, hour total? It's worth it. I typically get the island hot wings with rice and potato mac. 
My wife loves their rice, I do too, it's rare to find consistently good rice, but theirs is on point every time.
Everything I had from here has always been good and filling.
Got a Polynesian hankering? Get it fixed here!!! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Have you heard enough about the adobo omelet yet?  Let's say it's legit n tasty and move on, haha.  Not very strong tasting, but still good, even better w/some hot sauce.

The tapsilog is also yummy!! It's super strong tasting

Spam musubi's just alright.. 

Yay for unlimited drink refills

I believe there's siracha but u gotta ask for it."}
{"text":"Generous portions and seriously good food at cheap prices. Although I'm no expert, I hear the food is remarkably authentic, with Japanese, Chinese and Korean influences. I especially like the Hawaiin chicken rice and pork laulau. Oh, and don't forget the mayo-macaroni salad served with every order. All this culture in a strip mall at the crossroads of Tempe, Chandler & Mesa. Aloha!"}
{"text":"Went here and had Hawaiian food for the first time last week while in town for my wedding. DELECIOUS!! Sadly, we only have one Hawaiin joint in Austin but I will be buy now after discovering just how good this type of food is. Went with a group of people and we all had something different and all tried one anothers food. The one and only thing out of like 8 that I tried and didn't care for was the pulled pork. It had an over powering smoke flavor to me but not to some at my table so it was probably just me. Regardless, EVERYTHING else I tried rocked and I'm glad we stopped by!"}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend love going here when she wants Hawaiian food she's from the islands.Ive always loved asain food but Hawaiians have their own specialty I love it go if you miss the islands"}
{"text":"This place is a must stop whenever we are in vegas... and its usually the last meal before a long drive home back to southern california... 

Does it help I'm a Filipino who loves Hawaii? Yeah...but it probably helps more that I'm a glutton for punishment.

I usually order their signature dish, the Adobo Fried Rice Omelette.  It tastes like Mom's cooking... but instead of a runny egg, its omelette style...very clever.  Pair this with a Lilikoi Hawaiin Sunrise drink... and you're set.

Their other hawaiin dishes are ok, and their silogs (filipino breakfasts) are also pretty decent, overall its a great place to grub.

The only thing I felt wasn't really good was their Ox Tail Soup.  What I figured was KareKare, or some kind of Nilaga...was not... the broth was pretty tasteless.

Workers here a young, probably highschool or UNLV students... and mostly asian/filipino/hawaiin... so usually pretty cute ;) Cute girls tha work in a restaurant always makes my food taste better."}
{"text":"Great service, bad quality. The staff here is very nice and respectful, but the experience itself is less than mediocre.
Each time I've been here I've been greeted with dirty utensils and plates, an empty pitcher of lukewarm water for water cups, and unsatisfactory food. Aloha makes great food, the Henderson location proves this-- but at UNLV here the quality is bad. The chicken katsu tastes rubbery, the teriyaki sauce is cold, and somehow the chicken here looks slimy. Being from Hawaii myself, I know what Hawaiian food tastes like; this location of Aloha does not do justice to that. I'd expect that the many 5 star ratings come from the posters that they put up in their restaurant of \"free lumpia with your meal if you rate 5 stars on Yelp\"."}
{"text":"Starting with the service, the workers were quite friendly although there seemed to be an extreme lack of urgency for anything. I got the teriyaki mixed plate and it was fairly good except the beef portion was small compared to the chicken. The cleanliness of everything was up to par and the overall feel of the place was very shaka brah"}
{"text":"The food is amazing, one of my favorites in Las Vegas but in my past few visits the service has lacked. I Used to be a local here but with new staff the service has definitely taken a plunge. Not to say they are not nice, but that's about it. I am used to calling in my order and picking it up and by the time they give me it's ready. It hasn't been the same lately. Not to mention they always forget something. The past few times they have forgotten the Mac salad, the first time I didn't mind. These past couple of times I have. I called and let them know that they forgot it, they apologized and told me to remind them and on my next order I would receive it; my next visit I let them know and all they did was apologize but never bothered to make it up in any way. 
    I had stopped going for awhile but today I my bf and I had the cravings for some, so I called in the order and picked it up. I had to check it there to make sure everything was there. Again the forgot the Mac salad and extra teriyaki sauce that I paid for. When I ordered the locals plate I was told they didn't have beef, we said that was fine as long as we got double chicken; when we got home there was only one serving of chicken. Very displeased and probably will not be making a trip back anytime soon. It's really sad since the food is very good but the front of the house is very inattentive, they spend most of their time talking to each other."}
{"text":"So delicious! Very fast, friendly, and delicious:-) teriyaki chicken is the best in my opinion but everything Ive had is great"}
{"text":"Excited to taste it...I'm a big sucker for Hawaiian food...hmmm..I can already taste it..I like the ambiance...clean and cozy"}
{"text":"My first visit here and it was great! The service was good. I liked that you can place your order at the register, pay for your meal, take a seat and they'll bring it out to you. The food, awesome! I had the chicken katsu, beef bulgogi and the macaroni salad. All were great. Some places I won't do Mac salad cause it's either dry or salty. This was neither. It was perfect. It's not pricey and the portions are huge. I also tried their coconut shrimp and teriyaki chicken all satisfying and delicious. This place recently aired on \"Diner, Drive-in and Dives\".  If you're looking for some good authentic Hawaiian eats, this is the place."}
{"text":"Love this place! Its always a stop before of heading back home. adobo omelette is so good! i know i can make that at home but some reason it taste so bomb there. the kalbi ribs is good too."}
{"text":"This Place has amazing food!  I LOVED the Mac/Potato salad.  You get a lot of food for the money.  The place is clean, nothing fancy.  The staff is friendly.  I will be back!  YUMMY!!!!"}
{"text":"This is definitely a staple meal whenever my friends and I go to Vegas. Pretty good Hawaiian-style local food. Their dishes are yummy and affordable. My favorites are the loco moco, adobo fried rice omelet, chicken katsu and the Kalbi ribs! Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"I added this place on my list of places to try from seeing it on Triple D. 
 Absolutely amazing food.  I am so glad I got a chance to check it out.  I was out in Mesa for an event however I will be making the trip out here again for this as their food was so wonderful."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and to be honest I think it is good, but no good enough to earn 4 or 5 stars, if possible I might give it 3.5.
I would have to say that my current favorite thing here is the Kalua Pork; every time it is tender and delicious. If it wasn't for the Kalua Pork, my review would be lower.  I have also tried the katsu, bbq chicken and teryaki chicken, all of which are good, but does not blow me away.  The food here is simple, which I can appreciate.  It usually consists of your chosen meat, rice and a side of macaroni salad.  I think the macaroni salad is a little bland and heavy on the mayo flavor, but not terrible.  All in all this place is reasonably priced and turns out decent food."}
{"text":"Theyhave such a large variety such a large menu I recommend starting off at the student special if you are a student"}
{"text":"First time here we ordered adobo fried rice, fried saimin and the banana pancakes with mac nut sauce. Adobo fried rice was okay. Fried saimin to me it had too much celery which threw off the flavor for me. And the pancakes with macnut sauce were a fail, this what I was most excited to try. I had high hopes of it tasting similar to what I had on Maui. But it was not even close. The flavor has a lot of potential but the sauce was super watery. Wish it had more of a syrup texture rather than a milk texture. Going to try something else next time for sure. Over all the vibes are good at this location. Very clean. Aloha kitchens have been a fail for me in the past but I'm willing to give this one another shot."}
{"text":"This is the BEST Hawaiian BBQ! We get the terriaki chicken with noodle salad. The large is big enough for 2 people! This place blows GOLDEN BBQ out of the water! Always consistently been GREAT!"}
{"text":"The line went out the door, so i would advise ordering for pick up. 

+1 great prices
+1 LOVE the SPAM masubi
+1 generous portions
+1 it tasted pretty authentic to me. Way better than L&L
+1 a big menu. There was filipino food, hawaiian food, and burgers/fries"}
{"text":"OK, so a person is hungry and doesn't know where to feed their taste buds. This person is looking for some zest and that \"I'm in Heaven\" feeling, but still, nothing comes to mind. He/She asks a friend of a place where the food is \"new and refreshing\". That friend tells them to take a ride down to Alma School and Guadalupe and visit the Hawaiian delights of Aloha Kitchen. 

When driving to the area, one might get lost and believe that there isn't an Aloha Kitchen in that vicinity. The Aloha Kitchen restaurant is not a large dining out kind of place, in fact, it's not even relatively normal sized. It is an extremely small semi fast food place that is really hard to find. It has no flashing lights or big banners that say \"Aloha Kitchen\" on them. It has small words in plain text over the restaurant that says \"Aloha Kitchen\". In addition to the small writing, it's hidden behind a corner so if someone were traveling north on Alma School, they wouldn't be able to see it at all. However, just because it is located in downtown Mesa and is hard to find, does not mean it is not a good place to eat at. Do not let that sway your opinion, let the food sway your opinion.  

Recently, I made my way down to Aloha Kitchen to have lunch with a friend of mine. I, like everyone else, had trouble finding the restaurant, but I eventually found it and went inside. At first, I had my doubts about the place. Olive Garden, Charlestons, and Serranos all were great restaurants, but they also had great scenery inside. When looked at, Aloha Kitchen has plain white walls, hardly any pictures on the wall, and just wasn't very appealing. However, this was changed in a matter of minutes.

Approaching the counter, the cashier behind the counter was one of the friendliest ladies I've ever met. After months and days of serving the same people, one might get tired or grumpy. This was not the case. The service was down right AMAZING. If we needed something, they were to get us anything. Friendly, cheerful, and anxious to get us what we needed. That at first was already impressing. I had ordered the meal plate number three which consists of chicken katsu, chicken teriyaki, macaroni salad, white rice, and Guava (a Hawaiian soda drink). I had ordered all of this and an additional Guava drink, and then the bill came out. The total of my meal was seven dollars and fifty cents, a reasonable price. Yes a reasonable price for any place until my meal came out. I paid seven dollars and fifty cents for what someone might serve a king! A mountain of food was placed in front of me and it all looked so delicious. For the chicken katsu, they provided this special sauce that tasted like a mix of barbecue sauce and ketchup. The food was outstandingly delicious. For a restaurant so small and hidden, this place was top notch. Top notch especially for only paying seven dollars and fifty cents. 

If someone is looking for an exotic taste to fill their stomachs, Aloha Kitchen is the way to go. It doesn't have any flash lights or big banners. If someone is looking for that, go to a carnival. It doesn't have pictures on the walls or an artistic essence to it. If a person were looking for that, go to a museum. Aloha Kitchen is a wonderful restaurant with amazing islander food. And I will definitely return for another visit."}
{"text":"Yet another Hawaiian food spot that I dine at every so often.  The food here is okay.. nothing like home but it gets me by every time I'm craving.  The only thing I eat here is the Hula plate because almost everything else has some type of meat in it.  It is a Hawaiian food spot so that's pretty much a given.  There are some Filipino food on the menu as well but I tend not to venture too much into that area because of the same reason: the meat.  I like the fact that they have Hawaiian Sun.  But, I never seem to get any because the plates are kinda pricey already and I'd rather pick up a six pack of juice from CVS for the same price as one can here.  Food is alright but it just doesn't hit the spot like it should."}
{"text":"This place didn't have a lot of high hopes from the outside. I thought the tinted windows reminded me of that of a strip club. However, as soon as I walked in I was greeted by a nice guy saying \"aloha\". I thought it was comical. He recommended, seeing that I am a younger guy, that I try out their Ribs, so I did. They were everything I could ever expect from this place. He gave me a tip to use the sauce on the side of rice as well as the ribs. Let me tell you, it was a phenomenal meal. Each rib is sliced so that you can easily eat them with one hand and the meat comes right off of the bone. Overall, the food is awesome and definitely a good spot to grab food if you're in the area looking around. Also, try one of their Hawaiian drinks, they're delicious. I had the guava puree one and it was amazing. Overall, I came in expecting average and left saying Wow."}
{"text":"Definitely enjoy this place.  Very solid food, reasonable prices, good specials.  Check it out... but look for their hours first.  I think they close early on Sunday and aren't open Mondays.  We've shown up a few times and they aren't open..."}
{"text":"Always have to stop here before leaving Vegas!!! Hands down the best adobo omelette on the map!!! Highly recommended"}
{"text":"The food was really good I had the teriyaki chicken and the spam roll . The staff are nice. it's just unfortunate that it kind of looks like it's out of business if you see it from the street even though the sign in the window said Open.  They might want to remove the broken drive-thru menu, because there is no drive thru. That is the part that made me think it was out of business. But yes, i would eat there again."}
{"text":"Food was excellent! We catered for the company I work for and everyone was blown away by the sticky rice, chow mein, teriyaki chicken and sweet and sour pork. The portions were perfect and the food was prepared and ready to go on the scheduled time. Definitely do not skip the fried wontons and sauce!! Thanks Aloha Kitchen for making 30 hungry workers happy!"}
{"text":"The best Curry  Katsu I've ever had!!!!! Will definitely be back for more, my folks wouldn't even let me enjoy my food in piece, everybody wanted some!!! The wait was very long but ill wait again for that food."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times with my boyfriend. I love it! This restaurant introduced me to a new world of Hawaiian food (which I now love). I would recommend the student special with a side of spam misubi. The prices are cheap and perfect for a college student on a budget. However, I wish they would have a student discount since it's next to UNLV. The employees are nice and really chill. The restaurant and bathrooms are always clean. I would totally recommend this location to anyone!"}
{"text":"Not Good. Lived in Hawaii for 3 yrs. Ate my fair share of plate lunches. Not at all what I expected. First of all, a plate lunch needs good mac salad. This mac tasted like KFC potato salad, (yes.it had potatoes in it). I had the teriyaki chicken. It was a bunch of dried out, day old, chopped up chicken, soaked in some bad costco teriyaki sauce. I can't believe I drove all the way out there for that. 

Love Ono's and L&L. Don't think I'll be taking another chance on Aloha."}
{"text":"Bomb Adobo Fried Rice omelette and Loco Moco! Definitely try it out! It's definitely a spot I like to visit when I go to Vegas!"}
{"text":"I can't stop thinking about Aloha kitchen! On a recent visit to Phoenix a lady at the rental car place suggested it. I ordered the small Plate teriyaki chicken. It came with two scoops of rice and potato Mac. Just like that, I was back on the island! So, so good. Locally owned, made to order, friendly service, it was great! If/when I am back in the area I will be there again! Until then, I'm trying to find somewhere similar in Texas :)"}
{"text":"I've tried a couple of Hawaiian food around AZ, I found that this taste like from the islands. Great staff, good atmosphere and great prices. If your around the area give it a try, you won't regret it. I always order meal #3 Chicken Katsu and Teriyaki Chicken..mmmm. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"I have to say , I'm quite disappointed by my experience with this location . I frequent Aloha Kitchen on Charleston and Lamb with my family and I absolutely love their service , the food is fabulous and the mood is light ! Today , I tried this location to order my regular - chicken teriyaki bowl and a side of Mac salad . I paid $1.99 for what ended up being a tea spoon of Mac salad , which I asked for them to fix in addition to a rather dry chicken bowl . 
I'll never return to this location . I'll stick with Charleston and Lamb !"}
{"text":"Really quite confused on the low # of ratings for this eatery, then again, this could only mean the best of vegas has yet to be fully discovered! Aloha Kitchen, a Filipino/Hawaiian fusion of each respective's cultures most popularized dishes.  With that said, I give you, the adobo fried rice omelette and loco moco review.

I've been raving about Aloha's loco moco as soon as the gravy and my taste buds collided. Definitely brag-worthy, whether you've tried loco moco's before or not.  I was a first timer and have never even heard of such a dish. Once I returned to SoCal, I tried to find something, ANYTHING, that could imitate Aloha's and just wound up leaving Ono's & The Loft dissatisfied. I like how Aloha's asks how I would like my eggs cooked. Over easy please, thank you very much for asking!

Adobo fried rice omelette. Highly recommended by friends but enjoyed the loco moco more.  Maybe it was a bit too dry to eat post loco moco? Either way, it's definitely not something to miss, so don't skip out on this if it's your first time visiting."}
{"text":"The portion was huge, like a spaceship from the star wars! Plenty enough for two hungry people. I come here with several friends, starving after a party. I decided to try teriyaki combo - a combination of teriyaki chicken, pork and beef. I am not the biggest fan of the Hawaiian cuisine, but the food I tried was remarkably tasty. $8 - $9 are enough for a decent meal. They work around the clock. 
The interior is not fancy, actually is modest but it is clean. The staff is with friendly attitude, nevertheless they are working not very quickly and one might need to wait several extra minutes for the order to be ready."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time with a coworker. I wouldn't say that this place is anything special, but for the price, it was fine. It was somewhere around $5 for teriyaki chicken and rice. I wouldn't go out of my way to go here, but if I was passing by, it'd be worth another try."}
{"text":"Aloha kitchen's teriyaki combo plate is what I mainly come here for, It's a 3 meet plate, rice and a side of macaroni salad...yum but there's other great eats on the menu such as the mahi mahi plate and masubi's."}
{"text":"Great place! I went there because when I am in AZ and walk by there it smells amazing!!! I was right and will be going back a lot!!!"}
{"text":"Adobo fried rice omelet.

Some of the best comfort food to be had off the Strip.  If you like ANY of the components (adobo + fried rice + omelet), then all three combined will seriously blow your mind.

Large dining space and parking lot.  Not far from UNLV.  If I could perfect this, I would never go out for brekkie again (OK, almost never)."}
{"text":"There's this magical place that makes me feels like I'm home every time I get off the plane. You guessed it - that's Hawaii!! If you haven't been there, get there. My suggestion eat here first to give you a true taste of Hawaii. 

So this location is one of those hidden gems. Tucked away in a strip mall off a busy street that doesn't really have the exposure it deserves. Nevertheless as soon as you pop your head through the front door you're greeted by a true Hawaiian. Now your gonna ask yourself what's a true Hawaiian and I'm going to tell you. A warm greeting as you step into the door and that sense of familiarity, like your part of the family. The owner is a sweetheart and she definitely brings the joy of the islands with her to work. Full of laughs and happiness. So walk up to the counter, look up to the left to see the specials and grab a menu. You want another true tell sign that this place is legit? Snag a musubi from the basket on the counter. For those of you who don't know what that is, the best way to describe it is - it's a Spam burger. A piece of spam nestled in between 2 buns made of rice gift wrapped in seaweed. don't knock it until you try it this is a delicacy! I chose one of the plate specials and so did my amigo. We both grab the teriyaki chicken and coconut shrimp plate. Macaroni was the side and it was delectable. The shrimp were perfect-just the right amount of coconut with a side of dipping sauce. Same with the teriyaki chicken-not too sweet not to teriyaki. The rice balls had a nice glaze over them as well. Now I'm not a big fan of macaroni salad but I tore this one up.

 My plate was stacked high with food 

 pricing was great

 The taste was authentic and right on the money

I think we call that a trifecta. If you can't make it over to the island anytime soon at least make it over here to get a taste of what you're missing."}
{"text":"Not good as most other Hawaiian barbecues. This was worth trying but most likely will not come back for a second visit."}
{"text":"Okay, seriously? 4 1/2 stars? I'm so totally confused. And I feel deeply led astray by the Yelp community. This is a dive and not in a good way. The decor is really meh, and if the food compensated, that would be fine. But it doesn't. 

I had the Kalua pig and my friend had the pork laulau and we both found the food extremely bland. The Kalua pig was also very fatty and gristly. Half my plate was inedible. I've had much better Kalua pig at a food truck at the Aloha Festival. The chicken rice was the worst, though. It literally made me nauseated. There was something definitely off about it. I couldn't bring myself to try the Lomi salmon (but my friend said it was like pico de gallo with bits of salmon in it). In other words, we won't be back. And I'm still stumped as to how this place got such high ratings. The staff are very nice, it's true. But are people so desperate for Hawaiian food that they'd bump the stars up to keep such mediocre fare around? Well, you can have it."}
{"text":"Hadn't had Meat Jhun since I was stationed in Hawai'i back in the mid 80's. This place is the real deal! I will eat there ANYTIME I am back in the area.
Aloha Kitchen No Ka Oí!"}
{"text":"We went for the adobo fried rice omelet and also ordered loco moco, lumpia, and chicken katsu. The omelet was worth the trip! My favorite dish is the loco moco. Sadly, this loco moco did not live up to my expectations. My friends had a taste and agreed it just didn't taste very good.

On the upside service was great!"}
{"text":"Food stop whenever we visit sin city. Gotta have the adobo omelette for dining in and one for the road! Fast and friendly service as well."}
{"text":"Local yocals know this place. I got the local plate, 2 spam musubi, bbq beef and chicken katsu and side of macaroni salad. Ate everything the the mac...not a fan unless I make it myself. The beef was decently tender, the chicken katsu, cutlet thin, breaded lightly. Pretty good. Spam musubi is what it is. you either don't like it or do like it. I do. Prices is less than $8. Enough said. Nothing to wow my socks off but I'd make a return trip to try some other stuff."}
{"text":"Dropped in here after a failed attempt at Hash House, but so glad we stopped in on a mid Saturday afternoon.  We were starving! 

Ordered the local plate - 2 spam musubis, chicken teri, beef teri, mac salad (or kimchi)  and rice AND the short ribs plate (ribs and rice) based on the server's recommendations. 

Everything we delicious!  Probably one of the best musubi I've had, but I'm not a Hawaiian native, so don't know if it was authentic.  The mac salad was good and not too creamy.  The ribs were tasty, but on the thin side.  

Service was sufficient.  There's plenty of parking in the little strip mall area.  Cozy atmosphere. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"went here the past weekend while i was in Vegas with some friends and I'm pretty impressed. the employee at the register greeted us as we walked in which was nice.

place was nice with decorations that made the place nice to be in. i ordered chicken katsu with a side of macaroni salad and a side of one spam masubi. as for the food it self was pretty damn goooooood. best I've had in a while.

i would go back when i'm back in Vegas defiantly.

but why only 4 stars?
the table we sat at was still dirty  same with some others, we had to clean it ourselves before sitting."}
{"text":"Aloha kitchen is our ninth island favorite local food place. They just brought Mahi Mahi back which is fabulous! It is ono. We normally order a dish with a side of Mahi Mahi. Fried saimin or the kalbi plate."}
{"text":"Worst experience I've had at a food place I ordered a local place to go 30 minutes later I'm asking for my order as I see people and that ordered way after me get their food before me I stayed at the counter the whole time my food sat there for 10 minutes before they bag it up and then I tell the lady at the counter that people were getting food before me that were after me and she got an attitude I will not be coming back I came at 8 o'clock April 2nd"}
{"text":"Love this place. Friendly workers, food always tastes fresh and excellent portion sides. I recommend the potato salad. Especially love the Bulkogi Plate!"}
{"text":"Service is always good! Angie, Chris from the bar and when we go in the restaurant side the people behind the counter are always friendly and helpful. I LOVE the Kalbi ribs...tender, flavorful and always cooked just right. Melts in my mouth. We've had the lumpia-good, kalua pig-great, katsu chicken-great, and fried rice omelette with the port sausage-HUGE-delish!"}
{"text":"Alooooohaaa!!! Been to this spot like 5 times and I've always got their Adobo Fried Rice Omelet. I figure that all Islander restaurants have the same menu... but what place has an adobo omelet?? Exactly....

The omelet is filled with pork adobo chunks and all the rice is pretty much soaked in the sauce. No complaints. The egg is probably like 3 eggs that is cooked just right. They also add green onions to the egg, which I think is awesome! I like to put Siracha on top to give it some spicy hotness. Yummmmmm..... the omelet is huge so if you're not a heavy eater, then I suggest that you share it =)

I also get a spam musubi to go for the long car ride or the hour flight back to San Diego. I usually get my musubi's dry, I don't like the sauce they put in it. Service is great there and the omelet is on point... I'm sure the other items are good, you just have to read the other people's reviews to find out about them.

Not aloha hello... aloha goodbye!! Cheeeehooo!!"}
{"text":"Daaaamn Gina.

I finally tried this spot. Dude, I'm Filipino and it's 2016 - where have I been, right? Well, obviously not here, until earlier this month.

Service was friendly and although there was a line that had us standing inside right by the door, it moved quickly.

I ordered the adobo fried rice omelette (big surprise) and a half order of longanisa, put me out $12.37 but that's not bad at all! The omelette was HUUUGE and delicious. I was debating if I should order another for the road, but I knew I would be back in less than 2 weeks so decided against it. Of course the next day back at home I regretted it! Anyway, the longanisa - it isn't your traditional Filipino style longanisa, sad face. I knew it right when it was delivered to our table. I thought maybe it would be similar to a Portuguese sausage but it leaned more towards a hot dog, a sweet hot dog, if that makes any sense. It wasn't bad, but wasn't what I was expecting.

The venue itself is located in a plaza close to UNLV and across the street from, helllooooo, Starbucks, which has a freakin' drive through - WINNING!! YELP came through!! My peeps and I were able to roll through that Starbucks right before hitting up Aloha Kitchen and happily fulfilled our caffeine requirement for the day! Parking was easy and the venue was clean. Not a huge location but ample seating for good customer flow. Speaking of which, it looks like Aloha Kitchen agrees with local law enforcement as we saw several uniforms occupying a few tables.

Aloha Kitchen is probably a good cure to a hangover or if you're just straight hangry, or not. Come full and you will still probably stuff your face. Just make sure you do so before 10pm as this location closes earlier than the other location.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I've been here before and I really enjoyed it the first time; but this last time....how do you keep running out of fried chicken?  Ahh...when I did have the opportunity to taste the fried chicken, it was like home cooking.  So crunchy, just the right amount of seasoning...truly grubb'n!  Now, I wonder if that was fluke, since the katsu was ok and my husband's tapsilog did not hit the spot.  

The saving grace was the Adobo fried rice omelet.  sorry, that's what's up with this spot."}
{"text":"This place has friendly staff, good food, decent portions and is not too expensive.I will definitely be coming back here and I do recommend it."}
{"text":"This visit I had a Loco Moco.  Gravy was a bit on the salty side.  This Loco Moco was not even close to the best I've ever had. Quite honestly I was disappointed. This is coming from a Hawaii local who got fat from eating Loco Mocos everyday! Lol"}
{"text":"Their food used to be the best! But lately they started adding waaay too much of that sweet, sticky sauce to their spam musubi to the point where it's oozing out and ruins the taste. Also, why only 3 wontons in the saimin? For such a huge bowl there should at least be 5!

I'll keep eating here, but not getting those items unless they fix them."}
{"text":"Great food! Had the coconut shrimp which also included teriyaki chicken and a salad. Portion was just right. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Not sure what all the hype is about. First off, I went there craving some oxtail soup and so were others in my party. It was the main reason we drove across town to eat there for breakfast. Got there, waited in a slow moving line, got to the front and asked for a few orders of Oxtail soup. \"We're out\" they say. Immediate drop in stars right there. 

Now what? My mouth was craving the taste of oxtail soup the entire way over and now I had to change my mind on the fly. OK, lets try the adobo omelet then. It was eh.... I mean it's a great idea and all but there was hardly any adobo inside this adobo omlete. It was probably 80% rice, 15% egg and 5% adobo. On top of that they didn't add any salt to the damn thing and it was pretty bland. Another drop in stars. 

I kept hearing about how the Hawaiian food in Vegas is much better than ours here in LA but I beg to differ. It's terrible. 

Needless to say, next time I'm in Vegas I will just wait for the California Hotel for my oxtail fix and I'll make an adobo omlete at home."}
{"text":"Ok I come here every now and then. When I get breakfast I always order my eggs over easy. For the 3rd time in a row, my eggs were over hard. I'm not one to complain the chef because I don't want to waste food. I know what happens in the back. I used to be a cook. Please teach them how to cook eggs properly."}
{"text":"Ordered fried noodles. NOT GOOD AT ALL. All I tasted was the OIL. There wasn't much but there wasn't any salt, soy, garlic, I MEAN NOTHING. That's why I was able to taste the OIL on the noodles. There wasn't even a soy sauce package in my bag. 

You want REAL, TASTY, HAWAIIN FOOD, CHECK OUT ISLAND FLAVOR off Durango. THE BEST.

ok - Why did I call and spoke w/Judith (acting supervisor) and 2 THUMBS DOWN really now.  I told her that my chicken looked and tasted like it was from yesterday. And she totally didn't hear what I was telling her. She kept repeating that they use \"fresh\" chicken everyday. Please your a supervisor OF COURSE your gona say that BUT if the customer is telling you that the chicken is NOT FRESH ummm get a clue. Then she tells me that I have to bring the food back. OK WAIT LET ME THROW IT UP N BRING IT BACK. Hello this was my lunch time. I don't have time to take it back after work either. And she tells me that in order for me to get a refund OR another dish..I have to bring it back...wwhhaatt!!! OMG. Please hire a SMART, PROFESSIONAL supervisor that knows how to HANDLE these types of situations. I tell her that as a customer when someone calls and says there food is BAD it should be an AUTOMATIC thing to offer the customer a refund OR come back ANY DAY WITHOUT THE LEFT OVERS and pick something else. She mentioned to me that the reason why they ask customers to bring food back is because they HAVE ALOT OF PEOPLE CALLING IN and say THERE FOOD WASN'T GOOD...UGH HUGE CLUE, RED FLAG...Im not the only one..Get a clue Aloha Kitchen..IF YOUR GETTING ALOT OF PHONE CALLS, I would highly take it seriously on why your location is getting a lot of phone calls on how BAD YOUR FOOD IS..."}
{"text":"Honestly one of the best aloha kitchen joints there are in Las Vegas! Plus they are super quick with any orders and know how to get your food done right!"}
{"text":"We just returned from the Big Island and wanted to continue our wonderful culinary experience. We were very impressed by the outstanding food and service at Aloha Kitchen. We have been to all the islands and they truly represent the Aloha spirit and are true to the Hawaiian cuisine. We are happy we live so close and will return!"}
{"text":"Since I live next door, this is one of my go-to's for some Hawaiian food.  They have ahi poke served everyday, but I tend to always order the spam musubi.  There is a kalbi combo that I order on the regular because it is one of my favorites.  No bad surprises, expectations met."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Hawaiian food in town!! Reasonably priced and HUGE portions, their mini portion is too much even for me! The potato mac salad is amazing! The staff is always smiling and so friendly. If you're looking for something a bit lighter their salads are so refreshing and delicious."}
{"text":"My family has been coming here since I was a little girl. For over 20 years now...

Ray, the owner, feels like a family member. I love that he chats it up with his customers. The guy is hilarious and makes you feel like a valued customer.

On to the food...did I mention I've been coming here for at least 20 years? I have had EVERYTHING on the menu and LOVE it all! It is authentic and delicious. I lived in Hawaii for a few years after college and whenever I'm missing the islands I head over to Aloha for some ono kine grindz :)

Simple place, casual, no frills. Classic plate lunch style. 

The best Hawaiian food in AZ, no question. You need to go."}
{"text":"This place is so inexpensive and good! Decent portions that you can easily share with others.

The adobo rice omelette, spam musubi and saimin are really good.

Would definitely come here for a quick and cheap spot to grab food!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Aloha kitchen for years now and it certainly does fit into the budget of college students who order the student special, which consist of a Teriyaki chicken and a fountain drink. The chicken is pretty tasty and comes with the skin on, however if you're trying to be healthy you can ask for no skin. I have ordered it without the skin and it's just not the same and isn't as good. If you don't opt for the drink it's even cheaper which is just $4 and some change. When I'm broke I actually don't mind not getting a drink because the water cups are readily available at the counter. Service is nice because your food is delivered to you at your table. This is also a popular spot for pick up orders and I do recommend calling ahead of time because everything is made to order. This place gets pretty packed for lunch which is good they have the extended dinning area. I've tried a number of items here and I must say my favorite is the KALBI. It is so tasty especially with the sauce they service on the side and the green onions they use to garnish it with. I can honestly they make the best Kalbi in comparison to other places (like Korean) I have tried it at. The best part is it's only $8 which is good because Kalbi is usually pricier at Korean spots. I live near this location so I frequent here quit often. 3.5 stars but I'll round up to 4 since it's a family owned business."}
{"text":"I love Aloha Kitchen. My all time favorite is the Local Plate. It comes with 2 spam Masubi, yes I said 2 lol with chicken, steak, rice and can't forget the mac salad. OMG it soooooo delicious. 

If your going to UNLV and don't have a car, no worries because this place is walking distance and worth every step. 

The price is very reasonable, stuff is great & always a fun environment."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at this Aloha Kitchen location. I love love love did I mention love the food at Aloha Kitchen :) 

I normally eat at the Aloha Kitchen on Sahara & Decatur or near UNLV. A couple of my friends and I just got done spending our day at Cowabunga Bay and was looking for places to eat. I was so happy to see they had a Aloha Kitchen by Sunset Station Casino. 

I liked how the restaurant was set up. Lots of seating and it made you feel like you were in Hawaii. I ordered the local plate (2 spam musubi, beef & chicken teriyaki, mac salad and a scoop of rice) & Saimin  (like I always do) I was sooooooooooooo happy that the food quality was very consistent as their other locations. 

I was so full from my deciduous meal and very pleased with the customer services. The ladies working the front was so welcoming and friendly. I can't wait to tell all my friends and family that live in Henderson about this Aloha Kitchen location."}
{"text":"The year was 1996 and I just got back here from my vacation visiting ohana in Oahu.
I was so craving LAU Lau and Kalua pig, so we venture an hour away from home way across town to Mesa to have some ono grinds!

Let me tell you this was my first time having Hawaiian food, outside of Hawaii and homemade, I was so impressed it was like being transported back home!!

We came back for more in 2000, then moved back home to Oahu. Had the best.

came for visit in 2003, had to eat here, still great food.
Came for another visit in 2006, still ono grinds.

Then moved back to Az in 2008, and still they had ono grinds.
Now 2018, and living in Northern Arizona, and I am still impressed with the grinds, da best yea!

this is the ORIGINAL Hawaiian joint in all of Arizona and still my #1!!

Mahalo Aloha Ktchen for the many years of great service!"}
{"text":"i love this place. the beef skewers are awesome, the mix plates are awesome, everything is awesome. seriously, awesome. mini plates will fill your tummy, the regular sized ones are great for having leftovers for breakfast. the wednesday/saturday kalua pig should not be missed. and the chicken long rice ... oh my god. the chicken long rice. this is the only place in town i've found it, and i love it."}
{"text":"I come to aloha often as it is very close to my house. Food is always good and they get it together quickly. On the bar side , is always a cool vibe and drinks are good. 

Convenient, and good spot."}
{"text":"They have the best authentic Hawaiian Food BBQ style in Las Vegas hands down.  I came here last week with my best friend and have been craving it again ever since.  The BBQ sauce is not overly spicy and melts in your mouth with every bite.  I plan on coming here more often."}
{"text":"The FAMOUS Adobo Omelette. CHEAP EATS. Hangover Cure. Big portions.

Great place for comfort food and lots of seating."}
{"text":"The mini plate is definitely more than enough! I lovee the Bulkgogi beef. Only thing that disappoints me is they only have dark meat with their chicken dishes, which is a bummer because I only eat white meat! But the beef definitely makes up for it!"}
{"text":"Very good Hawaiian food. The actual restaurant is a bit unassuming but the person taking my order was nice and the food was really good.

If I have a craving for Hawaiian again, I'll certainly go back."}
{"text":"I've been to Hawaii a couple of times to visit an old friend who moved there. Whenever I crave a plate lunch here on the mainland like they do on the island, I usually hit up Aloha Kitchen."}
{"text":"I like the food and all, but my take out orders have been screwed up 3/3 times, from the small (house salad instead of macaroni salad) to the monumental (someone else's order). I wish I could speak more to the quality of the food, but it's hard to know considering I rarely get what I order."}
{"text":"Food is great here.  I'm attending UNLV so the distance is great for me. Portions are a good size and well worth the price. Definitely recommend coming here if you're looking for a great tasting quick bite."}
{"text":"Great food, good atmosphere and awesome people!! The Lau Lau was very good!! I felt like I was in Hawaii."}
{"text":"Our go to family favorite for bulkogi and manapua! Can never remember that they are closed on Monday's though, LOL!"}
{"text":"I always order the adobo fried rice omelet and spam musubi when I come here. The food is great but my experience here the past few times have been TERRIBLE. 

They are always busy and understaffed. I placed a to go order and waited over 40 minutes. Because they're so busy, the waitresses mix up the orders and give someone's order to a different table. 

Even when you call an order in, you still have to wait over 20 minutes for the food to be done. 

I do NOT  recommend coming to this location. They have a location close to the galleria mall which has better service and the food is just a good."}
{"text":"Everytime I'm in Vegas and looking for a place to cure that hangover Aloha Kitchen comes to mind.  I would only phone in my order for take out. Due to the service here. No smile and no hello, but other then that the food is good and the portion are huge. 

FOOD: Adobo Fried Rice Omelette of course. The only thing I get when in here. Just plain and simple and good enough for two people. 

Chicken Katsu was ok. A little to dry.

Spam Musubi. This was also just ok. 

Overall the a good place to grub after a hard night of heavy drinking."}
{"text":"I to-goed chicken Katsu,
I'm pretty sure I have to get macaroni salad but the person forgot today.
They forgot to put a fork last time, so I had to go back to get a fork, 
back then I tolerated them but making a similar mistake when I still paid the same amount.... I don't want to waste my energy to go back to get it.
The host's name is Travis. [:-["}
{"text":"ADOBO FRIED RICE OMELETTE! Yum!

This is a local favorite somewhat off the strip, but their adobo fried rice omelette is worth coming here for after a night or early morning partying on the strip. They have a karaoke bar attached next door for all you drunkard songbirds. 

Definitely a local hotspot after hours. And the two siblings that work there are hella cool too!"}
{"text":"Aloha Kitchen is where I go when I want to feel like I'm eating at my (imaginary) Hawaiian Grandparent's house. The Hawaiian Chicken Salad IS LIFE. I love it so much, I wish I could marry it. Everything here is amazing. THE ONLY reason I took one star off is because out of the many times I have been there, there have been 2 or 3 times that it just was NOT the Aloha I know and love. Totally inconsistent with the food I had experienced before. I don't know if they have a rogue chef, or just an off day. The fact that I keep going back despite those few times is a testament to how amazing it is every other time. I do think this is the reason that most of the yelp reviews are either 1 or 5 stars."}
{"text":"Aloha Kitchen is within 5min of walking distance from UNLV and a perfect spot to grab a quick lunch between classes. Aloha Kitchen offers onolicious traditional Hawaiian dishes from loco moco to garlic chicken. Menu is simple and straight forward.

Garlic chicken is always a must order for me whenever I go to a Hawaiian restaurant. The biggest and most obvious difference between the garlic chicken here and other places is that chicken is grilled here.

 At most places, chicken is marinated in garlic sauce then deep fried. When my order arrived to the table, I could smell the garlic but when I took a bite, the garlic flavor was barely there. It just tasted like a garlic chicken that was marinated in soy sauce. It was good regardless. Gravy was also good, albeit too salty for my liking. 

I've also got to try their loco moco over easy egg. Beef patty was definitely overcooked and dry and rice was sticky. Gravy was the same one from garlic chicken. Not the best rendition I have had but still not bad in my opinion.

Service is fast and friendly. I will be back to try more items!"}
{"text":"Outstanding meal. Driving by UNLV on my way to the airport and saw this and pulled in. What a treat and excellent food.
The BBQ chicken was loaded with flavor unlike some chains that grill chicken and throw it over vegetables. Rice and Mac Salad were perfect sides.
The Kalua Pig was amazing and we split a Loco Moco which was a huge hit as the gravy was the best I have had in years.

Really clean place with extra nice young lady behind the counter. 

The chains have volume, this place had that with a lot of really good flavor."}
{"text":"Back in college, Aloha Kitchen (by UNLV) was for the middle class otherwise we ate crumbs at DC.  And I ate tons of crumbs.  Chipotle was for the rich.  And anything a mile off campus then you were living life like a King or Queen.

I really don't go out of my way to come to Aloha Kitchen anymore but I did have a giftcard that needed to be used.  I'm blinging here, watch out.  When I come here I don't have much options but I do have personal favorites such as the BBQ chicken (which is grilled) but it takes awhile to be made, ahi poke which I grew up eating, or oxtail soup during winter.. that's a win for me too.  For my quick fix I'll grab a local plate since it comes with two musubi's, chicken and beef.

This Aloha Kitchen like the rest of the other stores have that cool, worry free interior design vibe.  I should take notes for my place.  I remember back in the day the Aloha Kitchen by UNLV had a student special and it was either $2.99 or $3.99 for a chicken bowl and free drink.  Good ol' days.  Note for next giftcard used, ask how much you have on the card! 

Now only if a lady in a grass skirt and coconut bra can greet any customer at the door then I'd be back every day."}
{"text":"I always come here when I don't have dinner plans lol , and I'm always happy and satisfied, food is always delicious and made as I like it , out of all the Hawaiian places I love their Mac salad the best"}
{"text":"Food was Ono I give them that. But charge for a condiment and butter, syrup for the pancake dish that you ordered and paid for who does that? & service was less then zero Aloha perhaps they should change their? name to Unfriendly Kitchen.  Hints why there's no tip in the tip can..."}
{"text":"Second time at this location and ordered a kalbi combo. The teriyaki chicken and katsu were good, but the kalbi was a little over-cooked; the rice was also extremely mushy, and I personally could not eat it. The cashier was really cool and helped me to pick out what I wanted to eat. The ambience of the restaurant is relaxed and chilled. I like Aloha Kitchen a lot, but the rice was very dissatisfying this time."}
{"text":"Kalua pork, lumpia, spam musubi, tapsilog, katsu, saimin soup, loco moco,  chicken adobo fried rice omelette--available late at night after the club!!! Yup, I did say \"chicken adobo fried rice omelette\"! Need I say more? This place is the spot to satisfy your Hawaiian lunch plate w/ Filipino and Japanese flare craving at any time of the day! They have three convenient location in Las Vegas. Onoliciously masarap!!!"}
{"text":"Wow! Went for lunch today. First time visit and it was delicious! The service was outstanding and friendly. Lunch was served lightening fast. It was fresh, hot and oh so tasty! Will definitely be back, again and again!!!!"}
{"text":"I got the kalbi (short) rib plate. The short rib was fantastic, it was a much thicker cut than I am used to. The meat was tender and it was marinated well! 

4 stars only though for two things
1. The Mac salad was pretty plain. It wasn't too mayo-y like I've had at other places but it was still pretty bland. 
2. The spam masubi was extremely plain as well. Other masubis I have had have seasoning on the rice and some kind of teriyaki sauce but this one was quite dry with just plain spam and rice wrapped in seaweed."}
{"text":"Tiny little restaurant tucked into the corner of a not-so-busy strip mall. It's a little difficult to see from the street.

The decor is awful, and is in need of a serious makeover. Super friendly service both over the phone and right when you walk in.

I probably go here once a month. The chicken teriyaki/Katsu plate tastes good, but I get those chewy pieces of chicken (I call them chicken boogers) in my plate every time.  Fish has been a bit bready for my liking They definitely give you a pretty good serving size, because I always have food left over.....I'm a big eater too!

Coconut shrimp is not made here as I've seen them take a bag from their freezer and cook it. I'm sure (although I'm crossing my fingers it isn't true), that the other food may be cooked the same way. Very disappointing to see that.

If everything was made from scratch here, this place would've gotten 5 stars."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst place to eat. I went there tonight to get food for me & my daughter. 
First of all let me tell you there was barely any food in the containers. I ordered two orders of the locol plate. The worst food ever. Never going back. 
Second of all I asked the girl there if I can have teriyaki sauce. She said it was in the container. When I got home & opened the bag & my plate. There was no teriyaki sauce. Don't waste your money & your time there. Never again. My first visit & my last one. Food smelled bad & was horrible."}
{"text":"Who writes a review for Aloha Kitchen? I do. So I always come to this location. It's by my job and I also take lunch to my BFF JILL. Jk. Anyways their cashiers are always super nice and I like that they updated their interior. Nothing crazy for a casual place like this but I appreciate the changes. Anyways they have solid Hawaiian food. I recommend their oxtail soup, their lumpia, and their kalbi ribs combo. I just wanted to shout out the staff and their take out legitness. They also have$2 spam masubi and I love them for that. Aloha over L&L!"}
{"text":"Literally a piece of my childhood. My parents have been purchasing food from here since the late 1990s and have enjoyed it each time. Each time they've visited, they told me that there was different management and different employees working. My favorite combo plate is the one with chicken katsu and bulgogi. I also recommend their vegetarian saimin, though, I feel as if they could add more noodles. Mana pua is also delicious. I wish they could offer kalbi on their menu again, it was one of my favorites."}
{"text":"Came here with 2 others and we all ordered different things and shared bites, and surprisingly, every single thing was good. I had kalua and katsu and the kalua was super moist and tender. My bf's kalbi ribs were amazing and his bro's teriyaki plate had tender meats slathered in a delicious gingery teriyaki sauce. The food was better than anything I've had in CA or even Hawaii (I've only been to a couple of places in Hawaii though). If I lived in LV I'd be a regular here for sure!"}
{"text":"Three stars for the pork dish I had, the rest was just OK. The mahi mahi my husband ordered tasted like it was battered in 12 eggs. It was like a plain omelet and very very bland! The chicken katsu wasn't anything special either. Service was ok. The food came out quickly and unlike other reviewers we didn't have to wait very long. Everyone was very friendly for the most part, and the place is clean, but I didn't enjoy the food, so I won't go back!"}
{"text":"I used to be a huge Aloha Kitchen fan back in the day. It was my go-to spot over 10 years ago.  Back in the day, I considered Aloha Kitchen one of the best for Hawaiian food in Las Vegas.  Big portions! Great prices! Yummy Hawaiian food! That was then, this is now. A lot has changed over the years. I either had really low standards when it came to portion size back in the day or Aloha Kitchen started to skimp. I remember the Loco Moco being so big. That's not the case now. The side of Portuguese Sausage is only 3 small slices too. I recently went here craving a high calorie tasty meal. My Loco Moco and Portuguese Sausage still tasted good. But I left hungry and wondering \"where's the meat?\""}
{"text":"When you think about being on a island paradise in the hot desert of the valley this place calls your name. I have been to the aloha festival at Tempe beach park many times and Aloha Kitchen always takes top prize! I'm telling you the flavor is amazing the char taste on the  chicken will blow your mind. Also don't forget the Guava Cake the flavor makes you think your on a sandy beach under a coconut tree. Ipo (Eepo) is the kitchen manager and she ensure you get a fantastic product. Her Customer Service is top notch. I loved this place so much I catered for my entire office of 75 people."}
{"text":"I love, love, love the food at Aloha Kitchen.  My favorite dish is the Chicken Katsu.  No other restaurant in the valley makes this as delicious as they do."}
{"text":"The service as well as the food is amazingly awesome. I love the positive vibes !!!! Definitely a great place ."}
{"text":"Service was mediocre at best. Food presentation was excellent although the cook must not know that teriyaki is a marinade instead of a topping. Chicken was the same but at least they use real chicken instead of precooked like some others. Atmosphere seemed Hawaiian when we walked in right up to when they had the local hip-hop station playing instead of one of the many Hawaiian radio stations available online for free. Prices were about right and I would go back if the other Hawaiian places were packed. No smiles, no Aloha feeling..."}
{"text":"It was ok, coming from hawaii i've had my share of plate lunches I mean I eat that regularly for lunch, but I heard about aloha kitchen I was pretty excited.  I had there katsu which I was kind of disappointed, because it was so dry.  I can't see how people would think there food is great, it's ok, i'm surprised their mac salad was good. I've gone their a few times just to try out other foods, but what can I say, it was ok, LnL portions alot better and tastier for me, but to each his own i guesss...Aloha, Aloha Kitchen, not eating there anytime soon"}
{"text":"Me and my brother first came here today, 4/15 and he had the loco moco, side of corn beef hash, and I had Kalua pig, rice, with Mac salad. 

The Kalua Pig was delicious, and didn't lack any flavor, rice was cooke well also. But for the Mac salad I think they could have done better with flavor. 

Corn beed hash was good also, and same with the loco moco. 

I'll be coming back here when I'm in Vegas again, 
Good customer service!!"}
{"text":"Best Loco moco!  When you're missing Hawaii or just want to get your Island spirit on, check out Aloha Kitchen.  Yah, Da rest of their food is Ono-licious too!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here before plenty of times. I believe they still have student specials, like a teriyaki bowl for something like 5 dollars. Helpful for hungry UNLV students.

I will say, I have not been back since May. That particular time, it was a Sunday afternoon having lunch with a friend. It was understaffed. My cashier was also my server, which was strange.

I ordered Pork Lau Lau which is pork wrapped in leaves. I only got it because I liked the name. The server helped serve me and unwrapped the food. I ate it and did not enjoy it much. It was worse that night when I got some of the worst food poisoning of my life. 

Either the pork wasn't cooked all the way or the server hadn't washed his hands after handling all that money and it contaminated the food. That was just my last experience. Every other time was an okay experience. 

I would just shy away from getting the more exotic foods."}
{"text":"Service was average. The food is okay, nothing mind blowing...their best food is the Kalbi and the Saimin!"}
{"text":"Never once have I ever been disappointed. I'm going to have to say this place is 1st ranked for me when it comes to authentic Hawaiian food in AZ. Their mac is delicious, the meat is never dry and always full of flavor. 

My two personal favorites are the teriyaki chicken or beef and the bulkogi! Bulkogi means \"fire meat\" in Korean. It's grilled and marinated is yummy sauces. Definitely give it a try if you're in the Mesa area- you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"It's pretty good for Vegas.  Good portion size.  The garlic chicken was served with gravy (little strange) and wasn't very garlicky.  Not what I expected but still tasty.  I'm thinking they should have just named it mochiko chicken with gravy.  Other peoples' mixed plated looked ono and good size.  Will need try um next time!"}
{"text":"Located in University Square, near UNLV, I can understand the appeal for college students.

The service wasn't slow for me, but I noticed it slow down for some customers after us. The staff is very friendly and kind, though. Their demeanor alone makes me a fan.

I'm not a big fan of Loco Moco in general, so I don't consider myself a good judge of what's good or not, but I finished my plate! Why did I order it? If they can make me a fan of something I don't usually enjoy, that would really say something...too bad it didn't quite work.

My wife got the longanisa, which was on the sweet side, so I thoroughly enjoyed it. If it's any indication of how good their Portuguese sausage is, I'll definitely be back.

We shared a short stack of the banana pancakes and two spam musubis, both of which were really good.

Overall, it's a great place, I just wasn't blown away, hence the 3-star. It's only my first experience, though. Maybe it'll change..."}
{"text":"Big portions and delicious Hawaiian food.  The venue was clean and had a nice vibe to it.  Went with a huge party and the food came out pretty quick.

A definite revisit when I go back to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Why does this place only have 3 stars? I got the pork and chicken teriyaki plate. Sooooo good!!! The pork was better than when I go to some places in Hawaii. Definitely coming back for more."}
{"text":"I was jonesing for some plate lunch this weekend so I hopped on Yelp and saw Aloha Kitchen had good reviews. Yelpers, you did not let me down - this place is awesome!

Hidden away in a random strip mall is this gem of an eatery. It's an order at the counter and eat off styrofoam kinda joint. But the food far outshines any lack of ambiance. 

I ordered the mini chicken teriyaki and the boyfriend went for the mini chicken katsu. The mini comes with half the meat, one scoop of rice and one scoop of potato mac salad. And there isn't much mini about it. This was more than enough food. The chicken was super tender and the sauce was plentiful and tasty. The potato mac salad was a surprise, but a good one. I'm used to just mac salad but the addition of the potato kinda kicked it up a notch. I ate every last potato and mac!

Boyfriend's katsu was fried to perfection and the sauce was served on the side. Bot of us left full and satisfied. 

Next time I want to go back on a Saturday so I can try the pork. If it's anywhere near as good as the chicken I'll be a happy island girl."}
{"text":"The Good:  My friend goes here every time he is in Las Vegas.  Why?  because of the adobe fried rice omelette.  Yes, it's that good, it's pork fried rice stuffed into a thinly cooked egg.  I wasn't sure about an omelette made with rice, but you know what, it works.

The Bad:  I'm not sure about the other items on the menu.  My friend got the Local plate and he ate like 4 bites.  The meat was fatty and greasy.

The Ben:  Tough call on eating here or walking over to Smashburger which is in the small strip mall.  Unless you are in the mood for a adobe fried rice omelette, go to Smash!"}
{"text":"I usually go here for the chicken curry (my favorite) but today I felt like having something else.  I got the mahi-mahi and katsu combo. It was hit and miss. The cutlet was nice and juice, and the macaroni salad was good as always. The white rice was a little mushy today. The mahi was kind of a mess. The fish was cooked, but the coating tasted raw in a few places.  It was also rather unattractive for some reason--flattened out so that when I first saw it, I wondered if they'd given me egg foo young by mistake."}
{"text":"Great food  I like order no the mixed plate so that it gives me an opportunity to try different foods."}
{"text":"Have been going here for over 10 years and always get the chicken bowl. Have never been let down by them, always great service and have never had a problem with my food. Don't like the location all that much and isn't the cleanest place but it isn't dirty."}
{"text":"The small portion of meat was of very poor quality and it was drowning in too sweet of a sauce."}
{"text":"I love me some Aloha Kitchen!  I mean it's Hawaiian food which automatically equals delicious! 

This location isn't fancy, but it gets the job done.  All of the food is cooked when you order it, so it is always nice and fresh when you get it.  You have to wait a little bit, but it is worth it to get your food piping hot and delicious!  

The menu has a huge variety of your island faves at reasonable prices.  Everything I have tried from the katsu to kalua pig to the loco moco has been great.  It tastes like everything I ate when I was in Hawaii.  YUM! They also have burgers and food like that for anyone in your party who isn't adventurous, which is nice because every group has that one picky eater these days.

If you want some great island food without having to go Downtown, check out Aloha Kitchen for sure."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Aloha Kitchen since I was a UNLV student back in the day. I used to get the student special when I'd come in here. I still order that on occasion. It aint much. Just a bowl of rice with some BBQ chicken and a drink. Its not a bad deal for a hungry cash strapped student. These days, there are other Aloha Kitchen locations that I visit more often but I still come by the Maryland Parkway location from time to time when life brings me to the area. And I more often than not order something other than a student special. I have found my nirvana in the locals plate. That is to say BBQ beef, BBQ chicken, Spam musubi, rice and Hawaiian style macaroni salad. It is basically all I love from Hawaiian food. How can you go wrong with what is essentially a greatest hits platter? I love it. Depending on who I am with when I swing by, usually a co-worker, I will get some lumpia too. We share an order as supplemental goodness. Its hard to share when you want to hoard but sharing is caring. 

The staff here is friendly. They are efficient at bringing your food to your table with just a few minutes of wait time. They clean up aftet you so that all you have to worry about is eating. And eat you shall. The food is good and the portions are grand. Now if you will excuse me, I need to wipe the drool from my face and grab some grub."}
{"text":"Aloha Kitchen is one of my favorite Hawaiian restaurant brands in Las Vegas. This location on Sunset is the fourth in the chain that I have been too. It is not the best of the four I have tried but its still pretty good. 

I always get a Spam musubi from any Hawaiian place I visit and begin my comparisons on that. This place has one of the best musubis around. A nice thick slab of Spam fried perfectly and wrapped with a tender nori. I love it. 

Everything else I've had here has been either good or average. I often get the Locals Plate with BBQ chicken, BBQ beef, musubi, rice, and macaroni salad. The beef is very good but sometimes fatty. The chicken has a lot of skin that I don't care for but is otherwise good. It always has a ton of flavor and is well cooked. Rice is rice and not much needs to be said about that. Hawaiian style macaroni salad is awesome and by far my favorite style. The one they serve here is right up there on my list. 

As for the average, last night I ordered a bowl of saimin soup. It was better than the saimin I've had at a different Hawaiian place but those noodles were so over cooked there is really no comparison. The broth here had good flavor but smelled very fishy. I was afraid there was shrimp in it and I am allergic to shrimp. Here I am now over 12 hours later and I'm still alive. All is good. The char sui pork in the soup was fine but there were several pieces of off putting fat masquerading as meat. I hate biting into a lump of gelatinous nastiness. The best part of the soup was the noodles which were plentiful and cooked to be just slightly passed al dente. Overall, this saimin hit the spot on a cold and drizzly night but I probably wont order it again. I'll stick with my regular order."}
{"text":"Ordered hawaiian plate to go and the rest of the order which were teri burger, egg roll, kalbi combo and lumpia shanghai was consumed in the restaurant. Service was great so was the food except for the shanghai lumpia which did not taste right. Not good nor bad but not right. We think the meat used in it was old. Wanted to complain about it but it got busy from all the unlv student coming in as it was close to lunch time so writing a review instead. Ate there this past tuesday 10/10/17 around 11:15 am. Hope management sees this to make sure all food quality is up to standards."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Kahlua pork, chicken katsu, spam musubi with extra macaroni salad is what I had. Cashier was friendly and food service was worth the small wait. From the outside it looks a bit worn down but once you walk inside it looks nicely set with floors and walls all done. Definitely a good example for coining the term a \"hole in the wall.\""}
{"text":"We were in Las Vegas October 6-9, we had kalbi short ribs plate, teriyaki chicken plate, char su omelet fried rice and some spam musubi.  Food was awesome, never had a bad meal there. Price is very reasonable and we always come here when we're in Vegas.."}
{"text":"This place is right near work, and we have eaten here many many times in the past since it opened. But things are going downhill here, people. Over the past 8 or so months they have frequently been out of basic food items. Like mixed vegetables often, and curry frequently, and chicken. Yup, one day they did not have chicken at lunch time. And the microwave has been broken for the past I don't now how long, so many things that should not be microwaved anyway that are on the menu are not available.

In the past 6 months they got themselves a new cook/manager. The women at the front have since changed again and again. And now this guy is up front a lot. And he is aggressive and ornery. Today was our last day setting foot in this place. We approached the counter after waiting patiently, and he instantly demanded to know if I was paying cash or credit. Then he chastised me for not ordering correctly (we always order the same thing and he knows it). 

There's an L&L on Nellis and Sahara. They are really nice and professional. And they have poke. They are never out of basic stuff. And they don't treat you like you are a criminal for asking for chicken with mixed vegetables (apparently, it is \"STIR FRIED VEGETABLES WITH CHICKEN. NEXT TIME ORDER IT THE RIGHT WAY.\") It was also nice when you didn't have to plead for siracha."}
{"text":"So good! I get the chicken katsu/beef bulkogi mix plate with macaroni potato salad and a Manapua. You will become a regular after the first try!"}
{"text":"Came here only because we were on a road trip home and my brother in law wanted to stop here and get some breakfast. We arrived 10 minutes after they opened and they ran out of everything, or at least that's what they told us. First we tried to order the ox tail soup; OUT, then we tried to order the banana pancakes:OUT, then we tried to order the bbq platter; not ready yet. WTH! we finally found something on the menu that they had which was the fried Simon and it was good. definitely disappointed we were not able to get the food we really wanted to try"}
{"text":"Aloha Kitchen is amazing. I've been here many times and the food is consistently great, even when they're busy! My favorite is the coconut shrimp/teriyaki chicken combo plate. I'd also recommend the bulgogi and spam musubi. Customer service is stellar - our waitress promptly brought out our food and confessed she dropped a shrimp on the way. Not even 5 minutes later, I had 3 replacement shrimp fresh out of the fryer! For a quick service, counter order restaurant, you won't find better food. You'll love Aloha Kitchen!"}
{"text":"Good food and service was excellent. What more can you ask for?

Came here with the BF and my bro after a long night of drinking. My bro highly recommended this place. I'm glad he did. Food was absolutely delicious.

The server/cashier greeted us with a smile as soon as we walked in. She was extremely helpful since it was our first time here, and was quick to recommend a few item to us. 

The BF and I decided to go with her recommendation and ordered the Adobo Fried Rice Omelette and the Spam omelette. Yum!! Both items were tasty and flavorful. The perfect cure to a hangover. We left satisfied.

We will definitely be back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"There are many of us who grew up in Hawaii and miss our local foods. There are also many Hawaiian-style restaurants in the Phoenix area, but when we want authentic Hawaii food, this is the place we go. Mahalo for giving us a taste of Aloha!"}
{"text":"WOWZA - adobe fried rice omelette, spam/eggs/rice, adobe/rice/mac salad = ALL AMAZING. Perfect for breakfast, lunch or dinner - SO YUMMY!!! They had a sign up sheet for zip codes for locations they want to open up in California - Honestly, Aloha Kitchen, Los Angeles/San Gabriel area is where all the Asians are at and will come clamoring for good Hawaiian food! Please open up in California soon, we are desperate for good Hawaiian cuisine - L&L definitely doesn't cut it after I had Aloha Kitchen!"}
{"text":"All I have to say is Pork Adobo Fried Rice!

Just this alone makes me want to drive 5 hours from Phoenix, to eat this and this alone. 

I love Hawaiian food for its perfect fusion of Asian cuisines but this has to be the best fusion of all in the history of fusions. 

Good thing they have 3 locations in Vegas so I can hit one on my way in and while by the strip and on my way home."}
{"text":"we always stop here when in Vegas! It is also nicely remodeled since we were last here. So yummy  and now they have spicy adobo omelette too"}
{"text":"Aloha Kitchen has been my go to lately when I don't really know what I have a taste for.  I get the same thing everytime, I tell myself that I will try something....then again, nahhhhh. 

Spam Masubi and Lumpia Shanghai, the reason for 3stars is b/c as much $#!t as I complain about the SPAM to RICE ratio of the masubi I still order 2 of them when I'm there.  The SPAM/RICE ratio is like 11/89 (11%spam/89%rice) where is THE SPAM.  I don't know how to make masubi so this is why I buy it, aloha is right up the street form the house therefore it's where I go.  No, this is not Hawaii, I know I know, but my Californian a$$ ate so much masubi in Hawaii it became my favorite fast food/quick meal.  To the point I was getting them from 7-11, but once again this is not Hawaii, this is LAS VEGAS is the SPAM/RICE ratio (to me personal) are very very unbalanced.

The lumpia is DA BOMB! and the teriyaki sauce OOOOOOoooooo, it is worth the $0.71, don't frown your face at the price.  You are not getting a little dipping cup of sauce, it's like a pudding cup of sauce.  I took the sauce, glazed some salmon that I had sitting in the fridge and tossed in the oven for 22mins, impromptu dinner, no seasoning needed.  Let's just say, I buy extra sauce I go, because I WILL DEFINITELY use it on something else.

The staff is super nice and the restaurant is always clean and in order.  However, I have heard good things about their kalbi beef, hmmm....I need to take a trip over to try it out..."}
{"text":"I love love love Hawaiian food and this place delivers! Their spam musubi is to die for, and their teriyaki is amazing. I wish I could go here every day. The employees are also courteous and so funny!"}
{"text":"I've been going here ever since I was a little boy and it never disappoints me. Every one is so nice, and the food is amazing! Cheap and tastes good, I usually get the mix plate with chicken teriyaki and Katsu, with potato Mac and a couple manapuas!"}
{"text":"BOMB ASS ADOBO FRIED RICE! We've been coming here every time we come to Vegas and everything on the menu never fails to be delicious"}
{"text":"What can I say about this place......Its BOMB DIGGITY!!!  Always go here everytime I go to vegas, right before we make the drive back home to San Diego. Always order the Adobo Fried Rice Omelet! I've also tried the Oxtail Soup here but does not compare to California Hotel's Oxtail Soup. The omelet portion can probably feed a small family of three but I've always finished it by myself feeling food coma right after. There is no place like Aloha kitchen, highly highly recommend trying their Adobo Omelet spectacular!!"}
{"text":"This place has the best Hawaiian BBQ in Arizona. Great customer service. Nice hole in the wall feel. JR Special with the Coconut shrimp is my favorite. The terry chicken is amazing. The katsu sauce could be better. I like more of a sweet sauce. Great place."}
{"text":"pretty good. good enough to get my fix considering this IS arizona in the middle of the desert LOL

the menu is pretty authentic. other \"hawaiian\" places like paradise and ono add words like \"island\" or \"teriyaki\" or serve up a plate of kalbi or a scoop of rice/macaroni and call it hawaiian, and expect you to THINK you're eating local kine grindz. 

ya gotta start with an authentic menu and build from there. so far, it's aloha kitchen"}
{"text":"What's not to love about delicious food that doesn't hurt your pockets?
My friends took me here and it was a good meal after a night of drinking. I felt full and so did my pockets. Sure, it's a little far from where we were staying but it was totally worth it. The service was fast and everyone was friendly. The teriyaki bowl was a huge portion and I was only  able to finish half. My friends got soup and Loco Moco. Both looked delicious, I was also pleased to see they sold Oxtail soup, I wasn't in the mood but next time for sure I will be giving that a try. I even ordered food to go for my fiance, he was reeeeaaaal pleased to find food upon waking from his long drunken beauty sleep. He gave me two thumbs up, only downside I would say is that their spam masubi contains way too much rice and very little spam. Parking was also plenty. If your in the area (even if you aren't!) do come by and eat, you won't be disappointed, way better than L&L's in my opinion!"}
{"text":"It's not bad, but it's not good either. They're not particularly fast with service, the restaurant isn't exactly in tip top shape, the restaurant staff aren't the friendliest..... so I'm not sure why I continue to come here! 
Spam musubi: It's hard to go wrong with spam musubi. It's good, no complaints. They're pretty heavy on the sauce. 
Chicken katsu: Way too much breading compared to chicken. It's dry and the katsu sauce isn't sweet enough for me."}
{"text":"After Martial Arts class, my family and I usually go eat at Aloha Kitchen in the evening (an hour before closing time). I love their Kalbi ribs with steamed rice. Always flavorful compared to other Hawaiian restaurants. The only thing I have a problem with the place is the smell of Clorox and the mop bucket that was displayed on the floor when I came in. 

I think it's best to wait until all customers are gone and start cleaning when doors are closed. Other than that, food is great."}
{"text":"I was left wanting... more flavor?? Now I only got a side of fries, gravy, and a spam musubi which totaled around 6.50$... pretty pricey for 3 sides!

The musubi was MEH. The rice seemed overcooked and it was pretty flavorless. The fries were what threw me off, 2.99 for a carton of fries is pretty nuts! The fries themselves weren't even that good, They're like a weird seasoned fry, I would've liked something more along the lines of the fries at Pop's. The gravy was decent, nice brown gravy.

Customer service was non existent - uncle wasn't the nicest. He literally threw my to go bag and walked away. Thanks? Rude! It wasn't busy... AT ALL!

Will I go back? Maybe... the one on Decatur is more customer oriented."}
{"text":"This place used to be on regular rotation before I went vegetarian. I loved the spam dishes, and adored the chicken katsu...I also am still frequently tempted by the kalua pig and cabbage...However, now that I am vegetarian, I've only been back twice. The most recent trip about a week ago, I enjoyed stir fried veggies, rice and the veggie egg rolls. The stir fried veggies (made with butter) and rice were absolutely delicious. My only complaint is that the diversity of veggies in the stir fry is very limited to cabbage, carrots, and maybe some peppers. I love the way AK makes their rice, and had no complaints. The portion size was also massive. As for the egg rolls, they just didn't do it for me. They were cooked okay, but were pretty bland, and the sauce with them didn't really help. 
The service at AK has always been good, and this was no exception. 
I dined with a co-worker, and a family from the mid-west who we had just met. The family loved their food, and thought it was very flavorful. So, if you are not used to Hawaiian food, this place could change your life. 
I am glad to know I can get full on a plate of veggies and rice, with enough left over to take home for all under $6.50."}
{"text":"I was looking for a menu online and I saw they added new items. I called and they said they don't control the menu online so I added the one they have there.  The fried noodles are amazing and the macaroni salad is the best you will ever have. I am not into sweets but I am told the guava cake is delicious. I have been going for years I've never had anything I didn't like and the staff is always nice and helpful would have given five stars but they dont have spam mushubi everyday and they run out when they do"}
{"text":"In Vegas for NBA Summer League.  Aloha Kitchen near Thomas Mack arena so figured I'd check out out.  When I went in, I saw menu items such as a Bento and a Mixed Plate. Don't see items like that except for Hawaii, so I was excited that the restaurant might have some fairly authentic Hawaiian style food. Unfortunately what I ordered was not. I ordered the Mixed Plate which was teriyaki beef, teriyaki chicken, and mahi-mahi.  Thr beef and chicken were prepared with a very sweet teriyaki glaze poured on top.  (Like Flame Broiler,  if you've ever been to one. )  A lot of places that have mahi-mahi n the menu now use  substitue fish such as Swai. The counter person insisted they used mahi-mahi.  I'm pretty sure it wasn't. 
The food wasn't really bad.   But it wasn't very good either.   And if you are looking for authentic hawaiian food, I'm not sure this is the place."}
{"text":"Love this place! My favorite go to for local food. Their chicken katsu is the best I've ever had. The adobo omelette and corned beef hash is amazing too. So happy its close to UNLV, I just wish they opened one on Oahu."}
{"text":"Good small place to eat,, great portions,tasty food, very busy establishment. Prices are average, service is good..id come bak."}
{"text":"I can think of no greater compliment for Aloha Kitchen than this: the adobo in the adobo fried rice omelette reminds me of my mom's. 

After an early morning drive to Las Vegas, lunch, and a little entertainment, my wife and I had dinner at this comfortable and casual eatery. Aloha Kitchen offers a touch of the island vibe away from the hustle and bustle of the strip. Order at the counter, sit down, then wait for your meal to arrive at your table. Locals, students from nearby UNLV, and Yelp-savvy tourists populate the restaurant. 

The adobo fried rice omelette is lip-smacking good. The adobo and fried rice are garlicky and flavorful, with the omelette cooked to delectable perfection. I tore through most of the enormous serving before hitting the wall about 3/4 of the way through it. I couldn't eat another bite, so I boxed it up for a late-night snack after a visit to the casinos. My wife ordered the pork kahlua and it was tender, smoky, and a huge serving. We also tried the spam musubi, which was your standard spam wrapped in rice and seaweed. Nothing remarkable, but enjoyable.

Aloha Kitchen offers affordable and delicious meals and it's a terrific way to get out of the casinos for an hour or two. The adobo fried rice omelette alone is worth a visit. 

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I went to Aloha kitchen today did it take out order for hamburger steak . But when I got back to work No fork could not eat my food was so disappointed because I had to look for fork finally I found a fork and got to eat it was not bad"}
{"text":"Wow this place is on my top 10. I truly feel like I'm eating home cooking. I've been twice in the last two days and brought in a few patrons who also enjoyed it. I got the katsu/chicken teriyaki one day and katsu/bulkgogi the next. Their macaroni potato salad is amazing and I don't usually go for it.  The rice also was well and had good flavor with the teriyaki all in all a ton of food for a good price.  Don't forget an authentic Hawaiian drink in the fridge"}
{"text":"Jam packed well after lunch hours. Full of mostly locals - Hawaiian locals that is. (That right there should tell you something.) I have not had island food this good since I left the islands.  I am serious - there is a place in Orem Utah called Matiki's and it was #1 on my list until this place.  SOOOOO freaking glad I found this place.  it will be the ONLY Hawaiian joint I hit up from now on!"}
{"text":"ADM, I heart Aloha Kitchen.  I've lived on Maui and Oahu and have not found a local mixed plate spot that rivals Aloha Kitchen.  Back in my days at UNLV, I used to frequent this place; and I still have yet to find anything as great.  Teri-combo along with some lumpia shanghai and extra mac salad- I ordered this every time without fail.  When I go back to Vegas, two places are on my radar: Aloha Kitchen and In-n-Out.  If I had to chose between the two, I'd say goodbye to In-n-Out any day."}
{"text":"Whenever I am in Vegas I try to make a point to visit.

Good food, great prices, fast service.

Kalbi Combo, Adobo Fried Rice, Kalbi Ribs, Hawaiian Plate"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time tonight and the service was great. It was super busy but the staff were really polite regardless. I got teriyaki chicken and sweet and sour chicken with the macoroni salad for my mother and I. It was spectacular. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My friends and I actually went to the one in Decatur Rd. I guess it's the same owner. Anyhow This place is good. They serve island food and other Asian simple dishes. I ordered the Mix Plate, Terri beef, chicken and Mahi mahi. The flavor is good. The only complaint I have is the size/portion of the fish is inconsistent. My friend also ordered the same thing as I did but he got more fish I.e. 2 pcs and I only got 1 very small piece. The atmosphere is not fancy it's very Hawaiian fast food laid back restaurant. They have a karaoke bar attached to the restaurant so that's a plus. Overall this place is good."}
{"text":"Decent hawaiian food, i'd have to say better then L& L because they do have more selection.

Ordered the Spam and Eggs...Yumm! I've been meaning to try the adobo fried rice...that might have to be for my next visit to the city of sin."}
{"text":"I really love this place...there really is no better Hawaiian food in AZ.  I ordered to go.   First,  everyone is so friendly,  The girl at the counter was very good about answering menu questions,  and brought me my take out instead of just yelling my name.   I had the mix plate #1, which mixes 2 battered fish filet and teriyaki chicken.   The chicken is dark meat,  cooked on the flame broiler then sliced and coated with a thick teriyaki sauce.... Yummy! The fish was lightly battered and perfectly deep fried... Moist and tender.   And of course,  you have to order the Potato Mac for your side,  you won't regret it.   I also had a spam roll... Yes,  a sushi style spam roll.   It was only $1.50, but it's certainly not one of the best things I've eaten there,  I just couldn't get into the taste of seaweed and spam together. Oh well,  I had to try it.   Over all,  another great experience.   I can wait to go back on Saturday... I'm craving a laulau plate!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I've been here several times and each time there has been wonderful food and service. I always get the BBQ chicken but I have tried several other things that other people in my party have gotten and generally it is great! There Macaroni salad that comes on the side is very delicious as well. Overall the workers here are very friendly and nice. It is a great place to go for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Manager is super friendly, served very quickly and food is consistently delicious and for the price it's the best"}
{"text":"great service! only giving 3 stars because the portions have gotten smaller. took my siblings here for lunch because i have gone here plenty times before when i stayed in henderson. i bragged about the great amount of food given but was disappointed when we got our plates. kalbi was mostly bone as well! other than that, the people are nice & i got my food quick."}
{"text":"When I want to rice overload, I usually come here. I get a local plate, extra spam musubi, and extra macaroni salad. The local plate consists of teriyaki chicken, beef, and 2 spam musubi. Yep, I can certainly fit all that in my tummy. It just takes me awhile to finish it all. 

Service isn't too exceptional, but has a home-y feel to it. It is close to campus and they also offer some nice student specials."}
{"text":"I've been at UNLV for four years and why is it only now that I've decided to try Aloha Kitchen!? I've been missing out on cheap & hearty food. Where else can you get crunchy-skinned and juicy teriyaki chicken on a bed of soft white rice for $4 that's just a two minute walk from campus!? There are huge plates that can be shared between two for $8-9 composed of katsus, curry, porks, and beef. Soups (although quite salty), noodle dishes, macaroni salad, and spam musubis are offered.
It's located close to the UNLV student union in the same shopping mall as Smashburger. The restaurant won't look like much from the outside, but is large and clean inside. Order at the front and a server will bring you your food. Definitely a place to consider for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"We went here after seeing it on DDD.  I'm giving it 4 stars because of the wonderous amount of food you receive for the money.  They have great sauces as well so you can individualize if you eat in.  However, the potato macaroni salad is confusing on the plate so if I went back I would get the salad instead."}
{"text":"Wanted to try a new Hawaiian BBQ spot and this place did not disappoint. Can't wait to come back & try another dish"}
{"text":"I come here when I'm on a budget. They will honor the student special here. But it's not as cheap as going to the UNLV location. Food is decent and service is always great.

Loco moco with egg runny. The best comfort food a girl can get. Rice is always on point and the egg is always perfect cooked to run down the Patty. The only thing I didn't find consistent is the gravy. sometimes it's too salty and sometimes there's not enough flavor.

Student special is teriyaki kitchen bowl with teriyaki sauce. If you're like me and don't want the sauce drenched over the rice then ask for it on the side. Depending on who's making will determine if you have more suance then rice."}
{"text":"I recently ordered from Aloha Kitchen through UberEATS and really enjoyed the food. 

I ordered a combination plate which came with kalbi, chicken katsu, and chicken teriyaki. The meat was served with white rice and macaroni salad. The portion of the meal was very generous and I was easily able to get two meals out of one combination plate. The kalbi was my favorite meat and well flavored. The chicken katsu didn't disappoint either. The chicken teriyaki was okay, but not something I'd order again. The macaroni salad was good and the rice was well prepared. My side of Lumpia was not good at all. The filling lacked flavor and the consistency wasn't good. Maybe something was lost since it was a to go order and this would be better in the restaurant.

Menu prices really can't be beat. For the quality and portions the pricing is very reasonable. As I mentioned, I think most people will find that their meals can easily be made into two servings for even more value."}
{"text":"Food is consistently good, very friendly staff. As good as island food gets!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was average, nothing special but the annoying part was being charged for teriyaki for our food!  Do you get charged for sauce at an American bbq place?  I can see charging for extra sauce but to charge for one is just this business being cheap!"}
{"text":"This is the second time I have eaten at Aloha Kitchen in the past couple of months.  Both times I had the Teriyaki Chicken small plate with green salad and each time I had enough to take some home for dinner. If you are a big eater, though, that may not be the case. I know I should branch out and try some different dishes, but when I find something I love, I usually stick with it! The staff is friendly and engaging, the restaurant is clean and inviting, and the food is wonderful! We got there when the restaurant opened at 11:00 and by 11:30 it was hopping!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for 13 years. They have the best Beef Bulkogi hands down. No one else compares.  Their Teriyaki chicken is tremendously awesome.  Whenever I get a chance I try to make it here.  You can eat in or order ahead to go. I GUARANTEE you won't be disappointed.  The Chinese chicken salad has a mix of greens and charbroiled chicken with a lite oil dressing. It's also fantastic.  Today we stopped by and ordered the Chinese chicken salad, chicken Katsu with choice of Mac salad or tossed salad, sticky rice and slice of fruit and either large or small portion. The Beef Bulkogi is served with scoops of sticky rice, Mac or tossed salad and slice of fruit:  or a side of Bulkogi is only $5. I LOVE LOVE LOVE Aloha Kitchen."}
{"text":"I've passed this location many times and thought I'd stop in and give it a try today. 

I ordered the Aloha plate which is very filling  the food tasted good in an average way. 

For me, food seemed a little pricey for the quality of food. I don't have any complaints , however I can't say it's above average either

I am neutral on recommending this restaurant."}
{"text":"It was mediocre food. The dish, overall, was kind of dry. However, my husband enjoyed it( considering all he eats is trash food). I would recommend to skip the fish and chips."}
{"text":"THE place for REAL plate lunch/dinner. Best Manapua available in a restaurant, best Kalua Pig outside the islands (Wed & Sat). Low key, as it should be. Never a negative attitude from any of the staff. Wanna know the real test check out the line for their food booth at the annual Aloha Fest in Tempe! It's 5x longer than any other booth, filled with natives that KNOW what the food is supposed to taste like. Never had anything I didn't love here! Great for the whole family as they serve \"mini-plates\" which are still a large portion! My son could eat their potato-mac all day long! I hear the pizza place next door is great, to bad I'll never know....unless AK is closed!"}
{"text":"Part of my Vegas ritual. Adobo fried rice. Great service, great food, great company. This will always be on my vegas rotation...unless you open up a location in Los Angeles!"}
{"text":"This is a very good place to eat.They have very authentic Hawaiian food.I really liked the Kalbi and their ox tail soup."}
{"text":"Great place to eat. Our server Paris was so great such a friendly personality and made our experience all around great. Will be returning"}
{"text":"Delicious selection...never disappoints. A must-visit every time I come to town! Adobo Fried Rice Omelette is big enough for two to share and still get full!"}
{"text":"Hallelujah!  I have found my go to for Hawaiian BBQ.  If you are not from here or are just looking for your next great lunch.  THIS IS IT.  Great Flavor, Tremendous servings.  And shhhh...I think there's crack in their Teriyaki Sauce.  The ladies are super fun.  I WILL BE A REGULAR.  Mahalo, Aloha.  You are paradise in the desert."}
{"text":"This place is ok..I rather go to Ohana!! The white rice is too mushy...wasn't sure if spoiled or not!!"}
{"text":"Went here after returning from Hawaii and kinda missing the food. 

The food here is sub-par. I found it to be bland and like another reviewer said, cheap. I didn't think it was anything spectacular, hence the 3 stars. 

Also, the water service bothered me a bit as well. The water comes from a pitcher instead of through the soda dispenser. It was a bit off putting. 

However, this place is cheap, so for the price it was warranted."}
{"text":"Ever heard of the infamous Freshmen 10? yes... Aloha kitchen was the main reason of my freshmen 10. LOL

Location: 4/5Because its so conveniently close to UNLV campus I found my self enjoying a beef bowl or a teriyaki burger a little too often. Thus how I got the \"freshmen 10\" but this place is super close to UNLV campus they also have student specials. The parking lot is easy to get into but getting out is a bit hard because Maryland parkway is always busy.

Food: 3/5 I keep it simple here, Teriyaki bowl and maybe I'll spring for a Spam Musubi or a side of kimchi. The Teriyaki bowl is decent, they're not heavy on the sauce here so that's a bit disappointing. The jasmin rice is perfect. I love their spam musubi its like the broke college students food other than ramen. Their kimchi isn't the best its not fresh nor is it tasty. It's soggy. 

Price: 3/5 You get what you pay for. This place is cheap and the food is pretty decent, I like their other locations especially the one on Charleston a lot better. 

Cleanliness: 0/5 This place is a mess, they have trays stacking with empty bowls and dishes of the past customers piling up. This was a super turn off when I walked through the door."}
{"text":"I'm going to keep this one simple and my rating is based strictly on the quality of food and service. As soon as I walked in, I received a warm welcome from the woman at the register. She was very polite and cute ;-) I wanted and combo that consisted of half beef and chicken with all rice. First I was offered the bowl, but being that I have a huge appetite I opted for the combo dinner which is a larger portion. The combo doesn't have just chicken and beef. It has pork as well. I'm not too much of a pork eater so she was nice enough to offer me extra chicken at no additional charge!!!! Hey Hey! Once I received my food, it looked so amazing that I chose to dine in and eat. The first thing that came to my mind was \"Lawd!\" Lol. The quality of food is light years above L&L and their teriyaki sauce is amaze balls. The crunchiness of the outer coat of the chicken goes very well with the soft goodness once you bite into it! I love spicy so I drowned mines in hot sauce and was blown away. I've also tried the one on Maryland Pkwy but this by far is my favorite. Make sure you stop by!"}
{"text":"Really great food at a great price ! Loved the food here ! It was worth the 32.5 mile drive. The staff was friendly and the portions were big. The mac salad was the best! I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I went here towards the end of the lunch hour push and it was still quite busy.  The line wasn't long, but most of the tables were full which is a good sign.  It is in a tricky parking lot, be prepared to pass it and whip a U-turn.  

Everything seems to be cooked up nice and fresh so it took a few minutes to get our dish.  Upon arrival, I received a plate overflowing with food.  I got the Beef Bulgoki and Pork Katsu (sp?) combo plate.  I have had both of those meats at a Korean place (Cho Dang) so I assume that is the influence on these particular meats.  Both were very good.  A tiny bittle too gristly on the bulgoki, but it was easily cut off and the flavor was good enough to make it not worry. 

 I chose my side to be maccaroni potato salad.  Yes, both combined into one which sounds a little sacrilegious but it was recommend by the woman taking my order.  It was actually very good.  The entire meal was very good and even someone with a healthy appetite like me was unable to even come close to finishing.  They pile the meat on top of 2 giant scoops of rice so it is definitely healthy portioning at this joint.

Compared to the awful food I had at Paradise Hawaiian BBQ in Tempe, this place is at a different level.  I actually got more food, fresher food, and tastier food for less money.  

The place was clean and the staff was friendly.  I look forward to going back to work my way through the menu."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb! Pork Adobo Fried Rice omelette is massive! Reasonable prices and authentic food! Uncle is da man!!"}
{"text":"I'd like to give Aloha Kitchen more Stars, but I was disappointed with my meal this afternoon. I've been here only on two occasions, but I do have plans to go back and try them again since they are so convenient. I think the convenience factor for me is the best part of this establishment. Considering there is nothing but fast food around my house, this place IS a nice refreshing way to get food fast.

Thus far I have had the Mahi Mahi & Katsu Combo Plate and the Kalua Pork/Katsu combo. I think it's hard to make bad katsu, so I don't have any issues with their katsu chicken. The Kalua Pork I had was pretty damn good, although maybe I tad too salty for me to eat the whole thing. However, it was juicy, hot and delicious. As for the mahi mahi, I was kind of disappointed. Maybe the way they do their mahi mahi is just not my thing, but I really did not enjoy it.

As for the sides, they're usually okay. Macaroni and salad is kinda hard to screw up. But sometimes I find their rice to be mooshy and not very good. 

Personally I would rather go to 808 Mix Plate, but it's incredibly far from my house. :("}
{"text":"Over the years, the portions have gotten smaller. The quality hasn't been as good from when I first moved to Vegas back in '08. This last trip did it in for me though. Came to order breakfast and a musubi and waited 40 minutes. I could've gone home, cooked and already been eating. It's a good thing that I wasn't working when I came in here because there a few guys that were dressed as if they were on their lunch break and they waited just as long, if not longer. I have never been to a Hawaiian restaurant, that offers take out, that took 40 minutes. I ordered my food at 11:19 and finally received it at 11:58. I know aloha kitchen has been here in Vegas for awhile...but there's other newer and older places that can handle more than 4 customers at a time. Needless to say, my family and I will not be coming here anymore. It was good while it lasted...the 2 stars were for the place being clean and the braddah working the counter."}
{"text":"Awesome fusion Filipino/Hawaiian food in a strip mall hole in the wall eatery a must if you're in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I came to Aloha kitchen for two reasons: 1) I had a business lunch and 2) a colleague said I needed to try Hawaiian food. This was NOT the place to try it for the first time. I had come teriyaki chicken because that's what the cashier said was the best thing on the menu. I went with it because I thought it would be done different than let's say traditional teriyaki chicken. Silly me. It was pretty standard and I could've gotten the same thing anywhere else. Probably much better. I would will not be returning to this chain most likely. I do not recommend it."}
{"text":"Not sure about the food yet. I was going to eat in since, as kamaaina, I was enjoying the music. Then I was told that I wasn't able to park my (expensive) bike inside (after the guy at the counter said I could. So much for kamaaina treatment :("}
{"text":"Awesome local foods best in pheonix Arizona.... Aloha The best local foods I ever ate in Pheonix."}
{"text":"I should have the read the yelp before ordering to see what tastes good here. I ordered the wonton soup (which is more like saimin, with chopped up pieces of pork, and sliced/cooked egg), manapua, and teriyaki burger with fries. It just doesn't taste good at all. Im not being a food guru. I just like good taste."}
{"text":"You might be in a mom & pop joint when there are employees under the age of 16.  I think one of the girls was like 13.  These guys know how to do business!  They are very friendly and when we had a problem with getting our order they gave me my money back without me complaining.  That made me want to go back before I even ate.  I got the mix plate 4 - Teriyaki Chicken and Katsu combination.  I liked the Teriyaki more.  I'd choose this place over Moki's, but I haven't tried any other Hawaiian places yet."}
{"text":"Picked up some take out  while I was having some work done at my friends auto shop and was craving some Spam musubi. Picked up some Teriyaki chicken bowls, Fried Saimin and my musubis. Pretty good overall, plenty of cha siu (bbq pork) in the fried saimin but the spam in the musubi was very thin :(
Not my favorite Hawaiian place in town but It can fill the craving in Henderson."}

Huuuuge serving, I can never finish it on my own.  I usually just eat half, and save the rest for later.. yes it's still freaking yummy later. Definitely a MUST TRY!"}
{"text":"This place has such low ratings, but I enjoyed it. It is 24 hours which is great! I could fulfill my hawaiian food craving anytime. 

The inside of the restaurant is nice and clean.  Lots of space, not crowded at all.  You order up in the front and then you could choose to sit inside on booth or table, or even do take out.  We decided to sit in.  I craved for Longanisa so I got that for only $5 and my friend got the kalbi combo plate for $10.  Score!! My plate came with 2 eggs, 2 scoops rice, & 3 sausages sliced in half (typically comes with 2 in Hawaii).  Her plate had thin sliced kabli almost resembling jerky, teri chicken, and chicken katsu, 2 scoop rice, and 1 scoop mac salad.  It would cost about $15-$20 back home! But everything was good.  Definitely made me miss the food at home but i found this place! 

Bathroom was also clean!!!"}
{"text":"Omg laulau. That really could be this whole post. It is one of the few things I miss from living in Hawaii. They only have it on saturdays, and call ahead to make sure they haven't run out. I had the platter, and ate the whole thing, which is not a good idea, because you will explode from being so full.

The atmosphere is pretty low key, and I absolutely LOVE that this is a real hawaiian place, not some asian fusion, we put a pineapple in it so its hawaiian wannabe place. 

On top of the absolutely awesome laulau, they have hawaiian specialty take home stuff, I got a frozen bit of kulolo which I can't wait to steam and enjoy. They also have poi, but I've never gotten into the stuff. 

Oh, and canned guava juice like I used to get in hawaii too, like biting into a real guava.

I was in hawaiian heaven, a pleasant reminiscence of when I lived there."}
{"text":"One of the best, quick decisions I ever made! Three of us completely satisfied from 3 diff combos. JR chicken or mix combo #2 and the mac & potato salad so worth trying! Genuinely yummy."}
{"text":"Ok first and last time here.  Tried the adobo fried rice omelette the rice is bland! I also had a custom order made which was incorrect. I told the cashier I cannot have pork in it. Asked if they can substitute the adobo for chicken katsu. He asked the cook and the cook says no that the rice already has the adobo mixture. I'm like ok can you do just chicken katsu and egg omelette? (Since no attempt on fresh rice will be made) the cook's expression was like it was a burden. Really? What's hard of cooking made to order eggs and put cooked chicken in it. Well when I finally get to my destination and hubby went to open his food why was their rice with pork in it? I am very disappointed!"}
{"text":"The only thing I liked at Aloha Kitchen was how clean it was....and empty. No other customers there, except my little family and I--yet it took 30 min for 3 plates to come out. Servings were SO small! Have they ever been to Island Flavor or Ross J's Aloha grill? They give good serving sizes for the price we pay! We pay the same prices, if not more at Aloha Kitchen and the plates are so small. They served a small piece chicken, 1 small katsu, 1 short rib on the combo. And we ordered laulau, it tasted old. The food wasn't even good. Aloha Kitchen, I understand why it was empty on a Friday night...all the customers went to Island Flavor or Ross J's. Terrible. The plate sizes were ok sizes for kids 9 and under. But adults deserve an adult plate for the prices we have to pay. My family, friends and I will be only going to Island Flavor and Ross J's from now on."}
{"text":"By far the best Hawaiian food in the east valley. My wife is from Kailua and this is her place to go for a taste if home."}
{"text":"This place is great! I've had the bento box and never been disappointed. I've been in for lunch and dinner and the staff has always been nice. This is one of my favorite places in Las Vegas. I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"I ordered via ubereats at 2AM at night and they delivered me some bomb kalua pork and spam musubi! 

The quality is decent. Maybe not the best Hawaiian  restaurant in town, but they are open 24 hours and fulfill he Hawaiian craving accordingly!"}
{"text":"Eat here least once a week and the food is great. Katsu chicken is my favorite and the service here is always nice!! One of my favorite Hawaiian spots"}
{"text":"Perfect for large and small groups, was able to accommodate my large group of 17 friends, but the wait for our food went accordingly.

The service was great aside from my cashier girl seeming new (she kept having to ask someone a question) but was able to order everything fine. They bring your food to you and there's a self serve water station in the corner!

I ordered the miso soup and chicken teriyaki both because they were on the smaller side for food. The food was ok, a bit salty though."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, I love Hawaiian food. Everything is authenitc, fresh, and very tasty. The portions are good and always filled me up, and don't let my size fool you. I will bet money that I can eat more than you.
You order at the counter and then they will bring it to your table, or you get it to go. Next to the counter is a little case of exotic beverages, unfortunately I have never tried any of them.

My favorite things to get there were the teriyaki chicken with rice which is beyond delicious, and the manapua (I think that's how you spell it). The manapua is this strange, sweet-ish roll filled with pork and it is possibly one of the most amazing foods I have ever tried, and that's saying something!"}
{"text":"This place used to be my favorite. But not anymore. My family and i used to eat her twice a day or more when we come for vacation. Now we steer clear of this one. The food qualiy has not been up to par for awhile. We only go to the aloha kitchen on sahara now. too bad we used to love this place. I read recent reviews on maryland and the food quality has been a C."}
{"text":"We came here just for the guava cake!! It was very good. I asked my boyfriend to get it for me on my birthday. Such a unique flavor for a cake. I'll be back to try their food."}
{"text":"Aloha!  Make yourselves at home at this cute little eatery serving a taste of the Hawaiian islands.  Dishes here are reasonably priced, with plate lunches that give you a lot of food for your dollar.  Wanting to try a variety of foods, I tried the Hawaiian plate.  The plate consisted of kalua pork with cabbage, clear noodles, and some lomi salmon.  The kalua pork was great, lots of flavor, slightly smokey, and not too salty.  The clear noodles were also very good in their savory marinade.  The lomi salmon was a bit salty for my tastes, but the salmon and other ingredients themselves tasted fresh.  All in all, a good place for a satisfying meal."}
{"text":"first time ordering food here and absolutely love it. i ordered the mix plate #3 with teriyaki chicken and katsu! definitely recommend it! nothing more to say then to go head over and try their food! :)"}
{"text":"First time really trying Hawaiian food so I don't have much to compare it to, but I'll tell you I enjoyed it. I got the Loco Moco which sounds amazing in theory but was a little bit much after I ordered it: it's essentially burger meat topped with gravy, an egg, and rice. My friends had the Adobo, which is one of the more popular dishes, which is an omelet filled with rice. That would have been my recommendation if you're a fan of either things. The Katsu was not too great either. Yes, I tried everyone's food.

The kids working there are young and nice, offering pretty good service with a smile. I came back a few days later for quick to-go order of macaroni salad and spam musubi and it took twenty minutes. The place does get a bit busy but they could definitely be a little more efficient in their orders."}
{"text":"this place has been open at least since last October and still no yelps?  It's good!  Try the pork adobo or whatever else is recommended by the friendly staff.

Do NOT order the teriaki chicken (well, or the spam, I guess).  Don't say I didn't warn you."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to have breakfast/brunch..... the servings are so large and the food is amazing.... the services we fast and the staff were very friendly. The Banana Pancakes are my favorite.... it just melts in your mouth. The Kalbi combo was amazing too. The katsu was cooked perfectly and the macaroni salad was just perfect."}
{"text":"First time. Cute little family owned place. The owner, Ray, came out and introduced himself. I had the mix plate #4, teriyaki chicken and beef. It was yummy. Comes with rice and potato Mac salad (mix of potato and Mac salad really good). Large portions and everything under $10. Try the Manapua, steamed bread with BBQ pork in it. Putting them in the rotation."}
{"text":"I love that this place exists so close to my home ( about 7 miles away.)  I come here when I want to be transported to the simple, homey, delicious, what-you-see-is -what-you-get Hawaiian bbq joint.  With this comes healthy portions of fresh, delicious, and very authentic Hawaiian cuisine, always served with plenty of Aloha spirit.  The decor, like the entire experience there, is simple and unpretentious.  You walk in and order your food at the counter, then walk to the left and grab your cups, pitcher, and plasticware... just like at the places on the islands where you would find similar delectable delights.  The staff is always friendly, and I hope that the following story relates both this and the priority that Aloha Kitchen places on freshness and authenticity:

I came here to eat with my lovely wife one weekend, and ordered the saimin (ramen), but they were out.  No worries... we were happy to order other delicious choices that day, but our Saimin jones had not yet been appeased, so we returned the next day.  When we were informed that they were still out, and that the shipment of saimin noodles would not arrive until later in the week., I (hopefully) politely asked just out of curiosity why one would have to wait days for a shipment of ramen, when it was likely available locally?  They let me know that while they value sourcing some products locally, certain ingredients (including the saimin..who knew?) needed to come from Hawaii to meet their standards of authenticity and freshness, and expressed apology that they could not provide what I wanted at that time.  Shortly thereafter, the owner came out to us and asked us if we like Ono (Wahoo), to which we replied with an enthusiastic \"Yes!\"  He then provided us with a large, delicious, and complimentary preparation of fresh Ono, which by the way was not on the menu, made sure that we were happy (not a problem), and had a nice conversation with us.  This is also typical of the down-to earth atmosphere and experience that keeps us coming back here frequently.  (though it is mostly the food ;o) )"}
{"text":"I got the fried noodles and I didn't like it.. it was mostly cabbage.. I was like where's the kamaboko, where's the spam.. I'm a big fried noodle person and there's disappointed me.  The mahi was also more like fish Jhun.. I thought it would've been made with panko.. However I did like Uncle who works there.. he reminded me of back home and how my uncle's are.."}
{"text":"Okay so up til today, I'd have to say I liked this place...sometimes over Ross J's Aloha Grill...There. .. I said it.  The reason? Well I really do love the Korean Chicken Teriyaki bowl at Ross J's...its only $3.50 plus they give you extra sauce if you ask...free of charge...   I alternate between this and the Aloha Kitchen's Chicken Teriyaki bowl for several of the following reasons:

1)The sauce at Ross J's is a bit on the salty side...AK has sweeter sauce.
2) I get really good service at AK and when i study at UNLV=convenience 
3) The portions have been more than adequate..(The chicken rice bowl as well as the Local plate)

Why they now down to 2 star rather than 4.5 star in my book ? ..

    Local plate no longer comes with RICE! WTH? They were really nice and just offered the rice after I made it a point to pay for a side portion of the rice so that was cool of them.  But i was quite taken back by their explanation of why this place no longer adds the rice in this $7.59 combination plate ( The menu says that all combos are served with rice and mac salad) \"We don't add the rice anymore because we put rice in the musubi!\" Okay..first of all...if you are going to offer spam musubi..it comes with rice on its own...it isn't good business to try to skim customers out of clearly what was printed on all the menus.  You don't advertise a plate with spam masubi and give customers the spam and tell them to pay extra for the rice do you? Vice versa...you shouldn't sell something with spam musubi and say that the rice is now counted as part of a dish and the portion of the rice that has always been included with it is no longer included! The employee was nice and told me that she has told management to change it on the menu...Problem is the rationale for excluding the rice now is irrational. 

I have always been happy with paying the extra 50 cents for extra sauce (although Ross J's never charged) because i liked it so much and i wanted to support the business.  But after today, i feel disappointed with this place...

Lastly, I ordered Mixed vegetables for a friend...opened the container and was really disappointed by their version of the mixed vegetables.  There was only cabbage and a few strands of onion...($1.99 for mixed veggies).  I think if you were going to charge this price..at least add a few for types of veggies..broccoli, bean sprouts ...carrots..something..not just plain cabbage that costs pennies on the dollar..
If you are in the area, like this sort of Hawaiian food ...the portion is okay...decent flavor & its still way better than L&L.  Unfortunately I don't like how this place does business.   Ross J's=You are still my #1 favorite..

Thumbs down..."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this small family owned restaurant.  They by far have the best Hawaiian food in the valley.  The ladies upfront are super sweet and energetic! Their prices are very fair and the food quality is topnotch! 

The only downside is they are closed on Mondays but it makes me want it more on Tuesdays!!!"}
{"text":"We've been here a few times before, and liked it fine. This time we tried something new on special, as a recommendation. It was bland, and horrible. We told them we didn't like it, and they didn't offer any sort of solution, no refund, no switch for something else...they didn't even seem to care, except the young lady whom took our order with the cool eyes, she was nice. We won't be back, the customer service really let us down today."}
{"text":"Lets just say...its places like this that make me thank God yelp exsist ...they're doin big things behind that kitchen!! Haha ive found a new love ... This place is a Gem forsure!!! only thing i can say is bad is wish they'd give bigger portion of rice :/"}
{"text":"I was to have a lunch meeting here, but it took me a while to find this place.  Why?
- I'm still a moron while navigating Arizona streets, and I get confused with \"N\"orth and \"S\"outh addresses.
- I ALSO found out that the numbering and directions change depending on the city.  As I was travelling North on Alma School in Chandler, I then turned around after a while because I saw I wanted a \"South\" address.

After much confusion, I finally found the bland, yet clean restaurant in the mini-mall BEHIND Safeway, and had a good meeting.  After the meeting broke, I ordered a bulkogi and chicken combo, and the owner, Ray, sat down to chat with me.  We talked about how we both missed Oakland Chinatown and complained about the Arizona heat.  He told me about how he moved to Arizona some 30 years ago with his wife (who is from Hawaii), and how they started this restaurant a good 20 odd years ago, before the plate lunch fad hit the mainland.

And he told me that weekends are a good time to come, so he can set me up with a new girlfriend.  Work your magic, Ray!"}
{"text":"We ordered spam musubi and kalbi combo plate. This place definitely has a quality and quantity on point.  The prices of the food items are definitely reasonable. We ordered a kalbi combo plate that came with bbq chicken, kbbq beef (which was too flat that i didn't even any striations of meat), and bbq beef. The combo plate comes with 2 scoops of rice and a choice of a macaroni salad or kimchi.  Spam musubi is on point, for what they give you, it can satiate your hunger."}
{"text":"I absolutely love these guys they do a great job every single time. I work just right down the street from me they are Awesome"}
{"text":"I grew up in Hawaii, but I've lived in the Phoenix area for over 10 years. I had heard of Aloha Kitchen's existence and it was on my to-do list for a long time. I went today and was disappointed. Beef was mediocre at best- very salty and swimming in a syrupy teriyaki goop. Wife wouldn't eat the rice as it, too, was slimed by the awful goop. Chicken katsu and katsu sauce was OK. Aloha Kitchen is what I'd call a zombie restaurant: the living dead. The \"blech\" food and the dated, worn decor tells me that the owner(s) stopped caring a long time ago. 

I won't be returning to Aloha Kitchen. Maybe it's time for them to say \"aloha\", as in \"goodbye\". 

Thankfully, we have Ono Hawaiian BBQ in town. Tasty and consistent."}
{"text":"Mom and I stopped in with the little one for carry out if you dont eat hawaiian you need to ask what everything is the poke was good just small portion for the price. The chicken teryaki bowl was good and enough for two.. I will be back to try a few more things..."}
{"text":"You really can't go wrong with this place. Great service, good food, and affordable prices. I usually come for the student special chicken teriyaki bowl which comes with a drink. All for under $5!!! Worth checking out! If you're a student, ditch the student union and eat here for better, cheaper food."}
{"text":"I dont wanna give you any star because yours is took too long for order and pick up me and my husband went there it got busy, yet 5 people after us got there food first   After testing the food it definitely wasn't worth the wait. Bad service."}
{"text":"I try to make it an effort to come to Aloha Kitchen each time I visit Vegas. I would have to say that Aloha Kitchen is the best hangover food ever!! Here are a few things to try that make them oh so delish to come back.

Adobo fried rice omelet. Mmm.. just like home. Homemade adobo (pork) cooked in garlic fried rice wrapped in an omelet! How can you not resist that! The adobo is perfect, tangy, soft and peppery. You can share this omelet however it is best to buy one for yourself and eat the rest for leftovers.  I like to dip my rice in hot sauce it gives a better kick!

Things I have also tried: Spam plate- nothing to fancy straight forward, you can ask them to cook is crispy or soft. Corn beef hash- mmm.. I love corn beef hash. They make it crispy on the outside and soft in the side. Eat it with rice, over easy eggs and ketchup! Adobo Katsu- Adobo with chicken katsu, rice and macaroni salad! 

The prices are decent and the food is great. However if you come in large groups they tend to forget a order :/ . It has happened to our party twice. A good place to check out off the strip!"}
{"text":"The worst aloha kitchen in Vegas. Service was super bad and the food was worst. Order a hawaiian plate for $12 and the juice the kalua came in taste like oil. There was nothing but fat with a lil bit of pork. The laulau was dry. They clam the they make it different  from the other locations. Which I been going to aloha kitchen for years and as far as I knew they all have the same menu. Hands down the worst aloha kitchen in the valley. Avoid at all cost. Go to the one on Maryland and tropicana.  Always on point there."}
{"text":"\"Every time I come to Vegas I make a stop here...\" seems to be the trending tagline for the reviews on this place (;

And it's true! 

Hawaiian food with a Filipino touch, it for real does not get any better. 
My go-to's? Definitely the Adobo & Fried rice omelette. DO NOT SKIP THIS. I've brought several friends here over the years and the ones who don't order it, and opt for something else taste my omelette and have instant regrets. ITS THE BEST THING OUT. 

Sure, if you're Filipino this is something that seems like a no-brainer at home. But look, if I'm hungover, or not...this forreal is the best meal to get hands down. 

Also, Banana Macadamia Nut pancakes. With a thick layer of Macadamia  Nut sauce that coats the cakes-- they're mildly sweet, buttery and amazing. I was actually here back in 2012 or '13, when they were first testing the recipe and they brought my group a stack to try (before it was on the menu) o0oOOuuUuuu Exluuuusive I know (;

Honest to God though I have not missed a trip here since. Great staff, amazing home cooked food!"}
{"text":"The place is very clean and hip, but considering it's next to UNLV it makes sense. There is plenty of seating and the decor is modern with Hawaiian motifs. I ordered some spam masubis and they were really big and tasty. They were about $2 and some odd change, so 6 of them came out to almost $15. It was worth it though because it hit the spot for my Spam craving. Next time I will try their Kalbi ribs. Service was a little relaxed, so I recommend calling ahead of time to save time waiting at the store."}
{"text":"Great food! No doubt about it! That's the reason to come back. But the reasons I would not go back here is the service. We had a dirty table and asked the server to please clean up multiple times. He finally said he would wipe it down once he gets the food to us, which is terrible. They should clean up right away. Another thing I'd like to add is that they already told us that it would take awhile to get the food out..they said \"20 mins\" when in reality it took 30 to 40 mins. Sorry.. I appreciate good food places but I had a terrible first experience here. I wouldn't suggest the one near UNLV.. maybe the one downtown is better in service."}
{"text":"Love the food. Went on a whim to try something different, can't stop going back. It clean, they are super nice and the food is much for not much $. The manupa everyone talks of is the best!"}
{"text":"Usually have take out from here..dinner is good.
First time in for breakfast, in the bar.
Atmosphere. .cold feeling- like a warehouse 
Also wear a coat literally cold ...burrrrr
Good music though!!
Bartender was friendly
Had Portuguese sausage and eggs with 2 big scoops of rice $6 well worth it.
Note :new slot club sign up get $10 freeplay after $20 played"}
{"text":"The last time I went here was before the renovations.
It was nice to come back to  more modernized surroundings of the Aloha resto.

I ordered my favorite Adobo omelette, and tried their tapsilog, lumpia shanghai, and took a few bites of the spam masubi.

\"Uncle\" as it was displayed on his name tag took our order and was courteous.  Although this is a Hawaiian restaurant, they have Filipino food as well as you can hear some of the workers speaking Tagalog.

PROs: the adobo omelette is a must have when in Vegas and is just a short drive of a couple miles off the strip. \"Silog\" breakfast items are available to choose from - tapsilog, longsilog, cornbeefsilog.  Dishes are not too salty and the tapsilog was flavorful.  Tapsilog came with a little of garlic vinegar and ketchup.

CONs: the side booths were a little snug for space.  Was looking for more adobo flavors in the adobo omelette just like I remembered the first time I was here.  Tapsilog was flavorful but small in quantity. Also, would have preferred garlic rice with our \"silog\" plates.  

I'll be back, hoping the next time my adobo omelette is just as flavorful as it was before."}
{"text":"finally went here and being filipino i had to try the adobo fried rice.
soooooo good. and it's super huge!

pretty close to the strip
the guy who was working there seemed super disoriented and weird and kept making mistakes, but it just ended up being entertainment for my friend and i haha

of course i saved the huge leftovers for later that night when i needed to eat after being super drunk :)"}
{"text":"My wife and I have limited experience with Hawaiian food, so we decided to give this place a try. We have an L&L near us that we go to once in a while and it's decent, but I saw this place on Yelp and decided to try something new. It was a mixed bag, though I think I would go back and just order some different items.

The main reason I went here was to try the adobo fried rice omelet. Though we also got loco moco, the local plate and a side of kimchi.

The fried rice omelet was hands down the best thing and the only thing we ordered I would get again. The omelet name is a little misleading, as its just a huge pile of Hawaiian pork fried rice wrapped in a very thin layer of scrambled egg. The flavor is much meatier and the consistency is more dense than typical Chinese fried rice. For the price ($8) this was a very good meal.

If you have never had loco moco, its a pile of white rice with a burger patty and eggs on top, then smothered in gravy. Its a simple, but very good meal. The one we got from here was OK, but nothing made it stand out and I could have easily recreated it in my kitchen.

The local plate is a great deal. Two spam musubi (meat on white rice, wrapped in seaweed), beef and chicken teriyaki, along with white rice and macaroni salad, all for $8.50. The musubi was fairly good, but the teriyakis were both mediocre. They tasted like plain grilled meat that had been smothered in a teriyaki sauce that was too sweet and thick. The mac salad was very good though (better than L&L's).

The Kimchi was a waste of $2.50. It tasted like it came out of a jar and wasn't worth it.

Anyway, I feel like we just ordered the wrong things. This place was consistently busy when I was there and everyone seemed happy with their food. I heard their short ribs and katsu are good, so maybe I'll give those a try next time."}
{"text":"WOW. This place is bomb dot com.

I came here for the first time last month after seeing so many of my friends eat here so i decided to try this place before embarking on my 4 hour drive back to Los Angeles.

It's not the most upscale place to eat at. Far from it, actually. But regardless of the interior, their food is G.O.O.D!!!! You walk up to the counter to order then they bring your food to you at the tables. There's plenty of seating, but PS, this place gets really busy on Sundays during lunch.

I ordered the Adobo Fried Rice Omelette with a side of corned beef. OH-EM-GEE let me tell you, the corned beef was amazeballs!!! I think it was the best tasting corned beef that I have ever had in my life!!! The adobo fried rice omelette was a HUGE portion. UHMAYZINGGGGGG as well. I dont know why I havent been to this place before. I was seriously enjoying every single bite of my food

My friend got the locomoco and I tried it and thought it was really good as well, not too salty.

I'm for sure making Aloha Kitchen a must-go-to spot whenever I'm in Vegas. I'm hoping they open their California location in Cerritos!!! (PLEASEEEEE!!!) 

Try it! I pinky promise that you wont regret it! ;)"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love a good heaping of Hawaiian plate lunch? I have been here twice, both times were to go. I ordered the No. 4 (beef bulgogi and chicken teriyaki combo) I also ordered the white fish battered in egg. I decided to do a salad with my order vs. the cold macaroni salad. I would recommend that you stick to the macaroni salad. The salad itself is just meh, nothing special. 

The bulgogi I think would of been better if they cut it up some vs. just leaving it as one big piece of meat. The chicken had good flavor. The fish is quite nice, deep fried but you can tell it is fresh not the store bought breaded version. The fish was flaky and not mushy. Overall not bad for a quick meal. Will be back to try some other items."}
{"text":"I was picking up books at UNLV earlier this week and I spotted the joint hidden away in a corner and I knew I had to give it a shoot. I took my mom there for lunch today and we ordered a Kahlua Katsu Combo and a Kalbi Combo. My mom is the pickiest eater and I never expected her to be lighting up fireworks about this place, she hated Island Flavor and was alright with Island Style. 

The Kahlua Katsu combo consisted of two sides of rice, the juiciest most flavorful kahlua pig and a huge cutlet of chicken katsu, the sauce was right on point. My Kalbi combo had a side of rice, OMG yummy macaroni salad! It had tiny pieces of celery and I absolutely hate celery but I couldn't even tasted it and I was in love. The plate also came with a super crispy teriyaki chicken, kalbi ribs that tasted like they came off the grill and a generous portion of chicken katsu with the yummy sauce. 

I'm surprise the rating isn't much higher. This is some of the top Hawaiian yummies I've ever had! Let's start with the prices, WOW, it's cheap and you are in for a big surprise. We ate all that food and two refillable soft drinks for $20 bucks and some spare change. I definitely recommend it. The place was packed so it must not be just me that thinks it's well worth it and highly recommended."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in this weekend after reading some of the glowing reviews on YELP and we were very glad I did.  This place is not about the flash, but about the food. 

We ordered the Chinese Chicken Salad and a Mixed plate and split them both (which was perfect as the entree was way too much for one person).  The food was fresh and delicious and we will be heading back soon to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC!!!!!!  Pricing is great as well.  Many a Loco Moco I have consumed and this one was rad!  No Hawaiian food in Santa Fe so this turned out to be a real treat."}
{"text":"Always a great spot for lunch or quick snack.. ive seen people get some awesome looking meals but I stick to the bowls for lunch/snack time.
Studen special is a steal of a deal!"}
{"text":"I used to come to aloha all the time when I was staying at the UNLV dorms. I like how it's nearby to school. It's pretty convenient with their prices and location. Their portion sizes are just right. My favorite thing to order would be the kalbi ribs. Its made perfect every time. Never been disappointed ordering this cause it's just so good. I get it every time."}
{"text":"We have been trying to eat at this place for a while now, but have always run into problems.  The first time we were told that they were out of the pancakes.  Out?  How can you be out of flour and water?

The biggest reason we have problems getting in is because they don't open until 10.  By 10, I'm thinking about lunch!  But today we finally timed things right and got to eat here.  And the verdict...meh.

My wife got the Adobe Fried Rice Omelet with Chicken, and I got the Banana Pancakes.  The omelet was pretty good; decent flavor, nice size, and chicken in every bite.  It could use a little more soy sauce in it, but other than that it was a hit.

The banana pancakes, on the other hand, were terrible.  They were seriously overcooked;  they were almost black on both sides and tasted burned.  And banana?  Not in these babies.  If there was banana in these, you couldn't taste it.  And the Mac nut sauce was flat; it needed sweetness of some kind, as well as vanilla for depth.  These pancakes need to come off the menu until they can do them right.  These are quite possibly the worst pancakes I've ever had.

All told, the omelet gives me hope that there are some things on the menu that are worth the stop here.  I'm just not sure if it's worth trying to find them."}
{"text":"OMG. After a night of drinking, the best remedy for this is the ADOBO omelette. IT IS DELICIOUS. I am sure someone in my family could make it but for some reason, I doubt it would taste as good as it does here.  Thinking about it makes my mouth water. I wish they had it here in San Francisco. LOVE LOVE LOVE."}
{"text":"My experience of eating here was NOT good! it was more like a \"plate lunch on a budget!\" I was soo not satisfied and very disappointed!  I ordered the \"Aloha Plate\" and they gave me small chopped up servings of each item. The chicken katsu consist of a small mini chicken chopped up, along with another small teriyaki chicken chopped up, and on top of it was the chopped up beef with grave sauce.  That was NOT the teri beef we all here up eating in Hawaii. That beef was more like the beef stew type of meat. The owner probably trying to save money by using the cheaper type of beef. The plate did not look appealing! The rice was okay not the greatest!  The mac salad was not like how they make it in Hawaii... Not good! One more thing, is the Katsu sauce...they use barbeque sauce instead of the real katsu sauce in Hawaii.. It's better to eat at L&Ls Hawaiian Barbeque versus here"}
{"text":"Aloha Kitchen is an endless source of incredibly awesome, well made delicious yum-foods! I've dined here countless times, and have tried all sorts of things from their surprisingly varied menu... When I was a carb whore, I used to go full hog on the Teriyaki Bulkogi Plate, and I'd ask for an extra side of the Macaroni Salad (it's SO GREAT), and savor each grain of their super sticky white rice.. Now that my diet has changed a great deal, I'm a bit more of a salad guy, and I'm thrilled to report that Aloha Kitchen has possibly the best salad I've ever had: The Chinese Chicken Salad.  It's huge, inexpensive, super fresh, tasty, and crispy. It features a truckload of Teriyaki Chicken, some fried noodle crunchies, slivered almonds, mandarin oranges, and a variety of really awesome leaves.  The dressing is exquisite too! I'm concentrating on the details of the salad, because it doesn't seem to get the attention it deserves in other reviews.. but as my love affair with salads grows deeper, and more serious, this may be the salad in which I judge all others against  Along with all of their other WOO HOO yay plates, if you're there while they've got Spam Masubi on the counter, GRAB IT. Or three.. I never knew SPAM could taste soooo amazing. Restaurants like Aloha Kitchen are a huge part of what I love about living in the Phoenix Area: Honest, amazing, affordable food that's served by independent establishments.
OH AND: Their seafood anythings are also SO GREAT! They are also masters at the art of fried foods. Woot!"}
{"text":"This place is hidden gem in Las Vegas! Food is very tasty and filled with flavors. Filipino foods mix with Hawaiin foods. Friendly service. This place is a local favorite!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Good selection of choices pretty busy though. Staff was very helpful and friendly. I had the aloha plate anf couldnt finish all the good food. Thr place was pretty clean and ill probably be back soon as i work close by. Thanks guys"}
{"text":"Aww shucks...I was so excited to try this place after all the recommendations from friends and the positive reviews on Yelp. I arrived here with my brother about an hour before they were closing. Despite the hour we arrived this place was packed with customers who all looked like they were enjoying themselves. We both got really excited, expecting a great food experience. But after taking a bite into our to go order I felt confused and disappointed. 

Combo plates come with white rice and your choice of a green salad or macaroni potato salad. We got the teriyaki chicken and the half chicken katsu, half bulgogi plate with macaroni potato salad for both. The portions are a great size and value for what you pay for but the flavors and textures fall flat. The teriyaki chicken was just that, nothing special. The sauce they use almost tasted store bought. My brother compared it to a popular chain restaurant's teriyaki chicken. The chicken katsu and bulgogi were probably the most disappointing. Both proteins were over cooked and terribly chewy. The katsu sauce was heavy on the ketchup flavor, almost to the point were I'm questioning if it was just ketchup. The macaroni salad, which I was most excited for, was bland and lacked a variety in textures. My brother and I ended up throwing our food away.

Service here was quick and friendly. The tables were clean...and the rice was cooked well? I'm not sure what else to say other than I won't be back for more."}
{"text":"Cool place with tasty food and good services"}
{"text":"It was OK. The rice was very bland and the macaroni salad was too. The only things good was the meat. I have definitely had better Hawaiian barbeque and good customer service goes a long way."}
{"text":"August 23 2017.great lunch. I have been going he 4 a while. 2day was different. I ordered a #3 that's always good or even great
But 2day it came with the sweetest cantaloupe I ever had.thats all I thought about the rest of the day.they have all different 
Kinds of drinks so try something new.the hours r odd.but worth it"}
{"text":"Awesome hawaiian local food. The best I've had in Arizona. Just like being on the Islands.  They need to make Loco Moco!"}
{"text":"This place is great and so close to UNLV (same complex as Smash Burger off Maryland). Ate here for the first time last week and was pleasantly surprised. Inside decor is nothing special but that's not why you come here. First time I ate here I had the Combo plate which was simply amazing. Rice was fresh and the katsu was cooked perfectly. Recently I've been getting the student special (only $5) for a healthy serving of rice and chicken plus a drink. Would recommend and def will be back again this week!"}
{"text":"Didn't see what the hype was all about. Yes the place had a line the entire time I was there and the seating area was nice, but I would not go back. I ordered sweet and sour chicken which I'd much rather get at a Chinese place. I tried my friends veggie stir fry noodles which I had high expectations for. I found it way too salty and the veggies were just a couple huge pieces of carrot, and cabbage. The girl at the register was not friendly."}
{"text":"We eat here several times a year. All of the main dishes are excellent. The dining experience leaves something to be desired, though - plastic forks and Styrofoam bowls are awkward to eat with, and there is not much atmosphere. But the food is great."}
{"text":"AFRO! 

aka Adobe Fried Rice Omelet. 

Located near UNLV in a worn down strip mall, this modest looking spot has some great Filipino breakfast. Definitely recommend if you're in Vegas and looking for some good breakfast comfort food. Be sure to add a side of Spam with your AFRO or a Spam musubi."}
{"text":"Aloha Kitchen is a nice place to go to if you need a quick fix for Hawaiian food.... although, there are a couple of places in town that offer better quality and similar price points. 

It's not bad, but it's not great either. Worth trying!"}
{"text":"Good portions. Great menu. Excellent service. Garlic chicken with gravy took me back to 1998 Leeward Bowl. Best Kalua pig I've had in the mainland, hands down."}
{"text":"I love this place. But tonight i decided to order tapsilog and it didnt taste or looked like tapa at all. Very dissapointed. The rest of the food were still good tho."}
{"text":"Every time I come out here w/ the sig fig and her fam, they make sure to come out to Aloha Kitchen...and I asked why.  Well, I stopped asking that question as soon as I took my first bite of my adobo omelet!  

I come for one item - the aforementioned adobo omelet.  Pretty much chicken adobo(filipino dish-very popular) with garlic fried rice, all placed lovingly and heftingly into a nice large egg omelet.  It's like a filipino torta/burrito, he he he.  The omelet is large and in charge and can be a pretty hefty meal; but I finished the last one all by myself.  The few times before, I shared, but I always wanted more - so I will always order one for myself in the future.  They've gotten a little smaller, but maybe it was just that one day that we went, because usually the portions are huge.

Now my friends like the other items on the menu as well, so I would definitely go back and maybe try something else, along w/ my fav item.  

There are several locations, but this is the one I like going to the most.  We've never really eaten there; always carried out, but the staff is very friendly when we make call our order in for pickup and the place is generally crowded enough.  Parking is pretty open since it's just off the strip, so eat there when you can, but most people I know pick some up for the ride home; when they drive.

Come often and come for the omelet!  :)"}
{"text":"I don't get the high reviews.  This isn't only the worst Hawaiian food, I have ever had, it is the worst food I have ever had. 

Went in to a packed, loud environment.  Waited and ordered a combo plate with rice, macaroni salad, beef, chicken and mahi mahi.  The rice was good , the macaroni salad and teriyaki sauce were ok.  The mahi mahi was gross. The chicken was dark leftover pieces of dirty chicken.  The beef was the leftover nasty pieces you typically cut off and throw away.

I wanted to throw up after eating this, or picking at this.  Gave the entire meal minus about 7 bites to the dog.

FYI:  They charge $1.50 per can of soda, they swear they are a venue with that price gouge!!!!"}
{"text":"Exclennt value and service. Steak can be wee bit tough but not enough to where you'd consider returning it. 
It's in the regular rotation."}
{"text":"By service alone, this place is crap. The girl at the register had to have an IQ of a doorknob. I phoned in an order one time and when I got there, I paid and sat down. I waited 20 minutes before the doorknob realized my food had been ready since I got there. And when I asked why she didn't tell me, she just looked at the cook, who had about the same IQ, and they both shrugged.

That's what you get when you hire a bunch of middle school dropouts. Who cares if the food was even good, this place sucks..."}
{"text":"Everyone talks about this place being so good and a must to cure a Vegas hangover before leaving the City of Sin.

Very nice employees.  Our orders were taken and I kid you not, by the time I filled up my cup with something to drink and looking for a place to sit, the server was already looking for where we were sitting to give us our food.  That was fast.  They probably were starting on a few Adobo Fried RiceOmelettes while we were busying ordering and paying.

My gf and I got the Adobo Fried Rice Omelette, Chicken Katsu and Miso soup.

The Adobo Omelette looks good.  The flavor of the Adobo is there, but it's just way too much.  For one thing, as much of a Filipino I am, I'm not a big Adobo fan.  I ate a little under half and just boxed up the rest.  Ended up chucking it.

For the Chicken Katsu, could use a little more flavor.  Although, they do give you a lot of chicken so that's always good.  It just didn't hit the spot that I was expecting to get when I saw it on the menu.  The sauce it comes with is very dense as well.

My gf also got their Miso soup.  We were expecting a small bowl just to get some warmth in your system after a weekend of partying.  I was wondering why it was pretty pricey on the menu.  It's because they give you this pho-sized bowl of miso soup.  They told us they ran out of tofu.  So in essence, this was literally just broth.

Would I come here again?  I wouldn't go out of my way.  I totally understand why people love this place.  I respect that, but this just isn't something I'd go after when in Vegas."}
{"text":"ADOBO FRIED RICE OMELETTE... thats all you need to know. ;)"}
{"text":"Although a bit overpriced (in my opinion), this is truly a place where one can enjoy their filipino-hawaiian food. Yes, I'm making my own judgement here.  I've been here twice, and there are always a lot of Filipinos here.

The food is pretty good.  They do serve a lot of authentic typical hawaiian barbeque type of dishes that you'd expect from an L&L or Ohana Hawaii BBQ place. Spam Musubi, Macaroni Salad, beef, chicken, and pork pieces, scoops of rice. saimin I think as well.

But this place is unique, and is known especially for their adobo fried rice omelet (a giant omelet stuff with fried rice and adobo pork [stuffed as if it were a turkey filled with stuffing]) and their oxtail soup.  The omelet is great the first time, but it's nothing that special.  It's nice to try just to say that you tried it, but I stay away from it because of its price.  The oxtail soup is also something not really special, unless you've never tried it before and would like to give it a try.

They have special student-i.d. meal deals, which is nice as long as you don't forget your school i.d., and you can refill your drinks by yourself, which is nice as well (compared to some places where you have to ask the cashier to refill your drink for you).

Thus, I give this place a solid 4 stars.  After trying Aloha Kitchen's specialties, this place isn't anything super special.  I'd rather go to Ohana Hawaiian Barbeque where it's more affordable, and just as good (if not better) tasting."}
{"text":"Most people think of buffets when it comes to Vegas, but for me Aloha Kitchen is a must every time I'm in in town! Their adobo omelette is one of my favorites. Be prepared for a hearty portion of savory fried rice and adobo ......and major food coma afterwards! I've tried other dishes too and food is just as great and prices are very reasonable.  Please open a location in LA please =)"}
{"text":"The BBQ chicken is my favorite.   Love the great family atmosphere.  The grand opening was nice and the steak and lobster invite night was so nice.  Starting to really like this place"}
{"text":"I happened upon Aloha Kitchen on my last visit to Phoenix. The food was authentic and perfect. I grew up in Hawaii and was transported back to the islands and my childhood. On my fortieth birthday, it was the perfect evening. 

The saimin, char sui bao, and the teriyaki chicken were great. I wouldn't recommend the haupia pie as authentic which is a good thing for the locals. When done exceptionally well, it is addictive. 

I will eat here during each and every visit to the area."}
{"text":"Hawaiian food just like we had in Hawaii!  We had the lau lau plate (only available on Saturdays I think) and it was tasty.  Definitely going to go back and try a few other things on the menu but we were pleased.  Its inexpensive and super casual."}
{"text":"One of the only places to get manapua and kalua pork around here. Authentic Hawaiian! So good."}
{"text":"Slow slow sloowww! The tiny little waitress is jumping around frantically like a flea. She needs help lol. Throwing coworkers under the bus u can hear her yelling at them. I sat at a dirty table and asked for it to be clean and she had the most rudest tone ever \"okay can u just wait?\". Took her forever to come and clean. I said thanks and didn't even get a your welcome. Just grabbed dishes and walked away. Didn't even bother wiping down the table. 

Food isn't even good. Regret wasting my time here. Took almost 45 min for our orders. Other location is way better service and food wise. Never coming back again.

ON TOP OF THE MOST HORRIBLE DINING EXPERIENCE EVER I WENT HOME TO FIND....

***They gave me the wrong order!! They gave me a loco moco instead of the adobo omelette that I ordered to go!!\" Ughhhhhhhhh!!***"}
{"text":"Good real Hawaiian food. Meats are tasty. Wish they had poke. Friendly staff, prices are kinda high."}
{"text":"Save yourself the 6 hour flight, the traffic to get to the windward side (where the family owned joints still crank crank out quality) and go to Aloha Kitchen. Now that Ono Hawaiian Foods has closed (heartbreaking for those that know...). This has moved up my list of places where you where you will find small family owned restaurants that serve real Hawaiian plate lunches. Good news for you it is in Mesa.... Aloha Kitchen is SOLID.

Guava Cake
Chicken Long Rice
Lomi Lomi 
Decent POI (sorry I have had it on Molokai... So that has jaded my opinion of all others).
Etc., etc., etc.......

Helena's or Alicia's Market better not close either...... I am not sure my stomach can handle the emotional strain of losing them and Ono.

FYI for clarification: Ono Hawaiian Foods in Honolulu IS NOT the same as the chain of mediocre restaurants with the same first name."}
{"text":"Great teriyaki sauce, the rice and macaroni salad were perfect. Saimin soup is my sons favorite now. Just the right portions and the right seasonings. 
I never seen my son finished a big bowl of noodles so fast before!"}
{"text":"Although there are a few pointers I would give, the food was good I enjoyed it. Ordered their coconut shrimp plate which comes with 6 pcs of shrimp, teriyaki chicken, macaroni salad and white rice with a pineapple. We brought the food home carry out and it was still super fresh!! The flavor of the chicken was spot on and very tender. Shrimp lacked flavor as well as the macaroni salad but they were edible. I would come back !"}
{"text":"This place was a little tucked away near the back corner of the parking lot but, I'm so glad I found it because it was a hidden gem. I order the mixed plated #4 and it came with teriyaki chicken and bulkogi beef, 2 scoops of rice, macaroni potato salad and a slice of pineapple. This was by far one of the most enjoyable meals I have had at a Hawaiian restaurant. The meats were well seasoned and the sauce was a lightly sweetened teriyaki sauce which complemented the chicken and the beef very well. The food was hot and fresh grilled to order. I must say that I even enjoyed the macaroni potato salad and my plate was left clean. I have zero complaints other than my husband who felt that they should have more options for sides, but that is only because he does not care for macaroni salad in general. Other than that we both enjoyed our meal and we will definitely be back for more. Yum yum yum yum!"}
{"text":"You would only go to this place for the food, as the ambience and decor is non existent. But the food is worth checking out if you are looking for something different. We were in town for a house hunting trip and I found this place on Yelp. We visited on a Saturday night fairly early around 6pm.

When I went to Hawaii many, many years ago, I fell in love with Lau Lau which is a chunk of pork steamed with spinach in a banana leaf. Aloha Kitchen had these as part of a special that night which also came with kalua pork, saimen noodles, rice, and lomi salmon (salmon sashimi salad with tomatoes). This was a huge dish and could have fed both my husband and I. All of that food was only like $10! I am not an expert on Hawaiian food but it was very tasty. My husband had the other special which was teriyaki chicken and coconut shrimp. He was very happy with his dish as well. 

This place is a great bargain. We were on a per diem and for under $25 we were both WELL FED as the portions are very generous here. All of the food is served on/with disposable plates and utensils. But don't let that turn you off, the food is worth trying out."}
{"text":"Good local grinds, nice staff, relax atmosphere as well. One of my stops a few times a week when I dont want to cook."}
{"text":"Nothing beats a STUDENT SPECIAL!!

Top things on the menu:
1.Student Special
2. Kalbi Combo
3. Adobo Fried Rice omelet!

The student special is the best value for your buck, especially for college students. When I was a student at UNLV, I used to walk here from the dorms. I choose Aloha Kitchen over UNLV dining commons food anyday. Aloha Kitchen is comfort food, that reminds you of home. Customer service is excellent too, very welcoming and accomodating! :)"}
{"text":"I love their food and service is usually good as it can be as the food takes forever. I just waited 20min for a salad. I just heard her ask where is my soy salad so I will be here a bit longer. 5 min later... The server just lied to me and said the different chicken takes longer to cook. I asked a half an hour longer, and she just said, yes I don't know why,  I should have told you. They offered me nothing for my inconvenience, not a free drink or side macaroni salad and they watched me sit there while other orders came and went after my order. I really thought my review was going to be a positive one which is why I cued it when yelp asked me to check in. So  if you're not starving or pressed for time aloha kitchen has delicious food. Maybe just order to go?"}
{"text":"Oh yea finally! I have heard about this place for quite some time, and finally made my way there. The food was FANTASTIC! I had manapua which was the best I've had since living in Hawaii. I also had the Bulkogi and Teriyaki Chicken combination plate with the potato mac salad. Excellent! 

The atmosphere is low key and friendly and prices are reasonable. 

Which is why I made my back a few days later after my first visit. 
This time I got the chicken long rice. They only serve this dish 2 days a week, Saturday is one of them. It was a bit salty for my taste (I don't eat much salt) but other than that it was very good. 

The best island food around!"}
{"text":"When to this place with very high expectations. After a successful Vegas trip for my friends birthday, what more to end the trip with a good place to eat before a long drive back to San Diego. The whole trip, there was a huge hype for Aloha kitchen being the Bomb.com and all that... I was amazed how my first and last  experience was the worst service I EVER had at any place I have eaten at (literally). 

My friends and I get there, and it did not seems busy at all. Just about a 1/3 of the restaurant was full. We were impressed with the menu items and we were excited to place our order. We sit down... wait... wait... wait.... and wait... then waited some more... 30 mins pass. With no acknowledgement of the staff that we have been waiting for so long and still no food. Then we see the another group of people who already ordered and sat down, get up and complained about the wait. Then they were told that their food has not even started cooking... I felt bad for them, as I am sure that they were waiting over an hour and nothing. Then the started to ask for a refund... then finally their food came out..

I was thinking, if their food is starting to come out... then our food should come out soon after a 45 mins of waiting. One of my friends went to go check on our food, and one of the ladies, stated that they just started cooking it. WTF really? 10-15 mins later.. our food started to come out and they were serving us the food that we did not even order. We tried to nice about it but the service was horrible. After straightening about ordered what.. Then find out that one of my friends and MY order has not even started cooking... WOW WTF!!!?!?!?!!??!! we waited... over an hour and nothing... WOW pathetic... I then complained to what is going on... why is everything taking so long and they made the excuse that there was no cooks or the cook who was suppose to be an hour earlier when we ordered, just came in.. 

Thank you for the courtesy of letting us know ahead of time so we could have at least thought about eating here... Thank you for not compensating anything for the time we have wasted waiting for our food and to find out that it was not even put in to be cooked. I simply asked if they can compensate us for a simple drink for the long wait.. and we got denied like it was our fault. ARE YOU FREAKEN KIDDING ME!?!? Asked for a refund, and it was a hassle for even getting my money back.

Finally... there was some acknowledge from the staff that there was something actually going on... that they were backed up yadda yadda... that would have been greatly appreciated hmmmm.... an hour ago when we first placed our order.

Honestly, I am not a negative person. I am really patient and I can understand that we are human and we all make mistakes, but I was not going to put up for any BS as that is all I got at ALOHA KITCHEN. 

NEVER AGAIN GOING TO THIS PLACE AND WILL NEVER RECOMMEND ANYONE TO EAT HERE.  

TIP FOR MANAGEMENT: CONSIDER NEW STAFF 

This is not a review, this is a hate letter to this place for the time and you have taken away from my life."}
{"text":"Out of all locations this is my fav. Always! Maryland pkwy by UNLV. Chicken stir fry-awesome! Kailua Pig- I get extra cabbage! Mac salad is the best! OX tail soup only on weekends I hear is good! Love, love this place! Must go when in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Amazing food my friends Jim and Carol know the owner and the food is authentic Hawaiian"}
{"text":"Very delicious and authentic!!! If you get there in tome you might be able to get musbi!!!! Friendly and fast and a great price!"}
{"text":"Have been going here for more years than I can count. Their manapua's are awesome but they don't serve them on Saturdays! If you are looking for fancy: don't go here. This is a low key, laid back place that serves amazing local food."}
{"text":"A friend took me to the original aloha kitchen and blew my mind with the adobe omelet. Since then they opened many more locations and somewhere down the line they were lost their consistency. 

The adobe omelet i had was dry and used over cooked left over chicken meat. The recipe is great, but the execution was bad. I recommend trying the original location."}
{"text":"I came here with some friends the other day and I was pretty skeptical because there was nobody in the restaurant, but i was pretty impressed. I got the Chicken Katsu and it was SO GOOD. Our food came out pretty quickly and the Mac was to die for! I always love Hawaiian BBQ and this might be my new go to place. I also got a mini and it was plenty of food for me. I think a regular sized meal might be enough for two people to share or to have leftovers for another meal!"}
{"text":"I am from hawaii and I'm here in Las Vegas for vacation, and wanted some of the local food i eat every day. ended up waiting 40 minutes for no food, after seeing multiple orders go out before ours, especially people who came long after us, we asked for a refund, we walked out without even trying the food. Ending up going next door to Wenershnitzel."}
{"text":"I CANNOT leave Vegas without getting an Adobo fried rice omelette to-go!!!! Trust me, you won't be disappointed!

It's basically what it sounds like. It's pulled pork adobo (Filipino seasoning) fried rice with an omelette wrapped around it. It's effing delicious by itself, but I like to add some sriracha on top. It's definitely the best hangover food ever. Add a Hawaiian Sun on the side and you're good to go!

I haven't tried any of the other food here, but I'm happy with just the adobo fried rice omelette. :)"}
{"text":"I ordered mahi mahi and it was basically a fish omelette. The egg batter overpowers the fish."}
{"text":"Very consistent food, service and ambiance.  Real good Hawaiian plate lunch, in a setting like the local places in hawaii, plain, mostly utilitarian.  The potato mac salad is great, I've never been able to find anything similar.  This is not fine dining, plastic utensils, disposable plates, etc.. but I've been coming here for longer then I can remember and will come as long as they are open.  My favorites are the bulgolgi, teriyaki chicken,  saimin, and kalua pork if I can get there on Saturday.  I do add sriracha to my saimin and always pepper my potato mac but only because that's how I like it.  Huge portions on the regular plate, just right on the mini plate.  If you ever go the the Phoenix Aloha Festival you can recognize Aloha Kitchens booth because they always have the longest line.  Closes early on Sundays and is also closed Monday."}
{"text":"I personally like aloha kitchen. Ive been going there for years now, me being from southern Cali, this is the place we stop at before we go home, we used to also go to the sanwich spot next door but they closed down (i think it was called caparellis), anyway, I suggest you order the adobo omelete, its wonderful!!! and get extra adobo sauce with it!!!"}
{"text":"Before arriving to Aloha Kitchen, my expectations where that of a smile upon arrival and moderately speedy service knowing that it is mainly a takeout focused restaurant. When I walked through the door, I immediately smelled the teriyaki grill; It instantly made me more hungry. There was soft Hawaiian/Island music playing that really captured a smooth, friendly, no worries type of theme. There was not an overwhelming amount of Hawaiian décor, just enough to fit the ambiance and keep a modest, family owned touch to the place. 
 As I approached the register I was greeted with a \"What can I get started for you?\" I replied by ordering the Kalbi Ribs displayed on the menu board above and behind the register. The cashier took my credit card, gave me a receipt and a number holder for my table then said \"Sit anywhere you'd like, your meal should be out in about 10 minutes.\" As promised, about 10 minutes after sitting my meal was brought out to me. The food was absolutely to die for. The ribs where cooked with just the right amount of tenderness, and had an amazing amount of flavor. This meal was definitely worth the wait.
 In all, the restaurant does a fantastic job providing a calm, relaxing feeling throughout the entire experience. The cashier could have done a better job greeting me with a \"hello\", or a \"how is your day going\" before getting straight to \"What can I get started for you?\" However, too much conversation could be a bit annoying so she did a great job keeping it quick and to the point. The food and experience was fantastic, and will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"As someone from Hawaii, I can recognize amazing Local food when I eat it. And this place definitely hits the spot! Their prices are great for their portions and the food tastes like home! I definitely recommend the Chicken Katsu curry, or Loco Moco!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend the halo halo here. Best I've ever had! I don't think you can go wrong with any of their meals. Very affordable and super delicious! I'm bummed I can't eat here often because I don't live in Vegas."}
{"text":"We had a bunch of friends over and ordered catering from here. Our favorites were the fish, kalbi, and macaroni salad. The portions were generous and we had yummy leftovers for a couple days. I would definitely return and keep this place in mind the next time we have a bunch of people over again."}
{"text":"The Only good thing to eat here is their spam an eggs for breakfast an teriyaki cheeseburger and fries. For their shrimp tempura an jus my luck store brought and it was hard as a rock, their kalua pig and cabbage was sooooo salty I don't want to try anything else.."}
{"text":"During my niece's basketball tournament, we decided to drive to Aloha Kitchen around the corner from UNLV to enjoy a quick lunch.  I was stoked, because this is one of my favorite Hawaiian food places in the valley.  

The location is definitely located in a sketchy area.  Next to In-N-Out on Maryland and Tropicana, I feel like they were trying to target the students at UNLV.  I feel bad for someone walking to location at night.  Definitely a dangerous looking area.  The reason for my low score is the staff.  There's a little Filipino looking girl with a name starting with a V (I think Veronica) that works there.  First off, when there are a lot of people in line, she definitely seems to crack under pressure.  No smile, no small talk, sighing at requests all the time and giving attitude.  I was not a fan at all.  I was even going to go as far as to send a message to the owner of the restaurant, informing them of this rude behavior.  I was with a group of 20.  I understand that amount can get super overwhelming, however, she is definitely in the industry to create the best experience for every customer.  At one point, I asked her for more water as the pitchers on the side were empty.  She looked at me, rolled her eyes, sighed a little and took the pitcher from my hands.  LIVID I was!

Now that I'm done ranting, here's what I got:

For lunch, I got the Aloha plate for $7.99 and (2) spam musubis for $1.99 each.  The musubi was super good!  Different textures like the sticky rice, fried and salty spam and the crunchy seaweed that held everything together!  Although I ordered the Aloha plate, when I got back to the gym, I discovered that I actually got the adobo plate!  I was so pissed because that's not what I wanted!!!  In the adobo plate, though, it comes with a bunch of pork chunks cooked in vinegar and soy sauce, with two scoops of rice.  What made me more mad was the fact that the adobo to me was dry.  It came in a to-go bowl with lots of the soup it was cooked in, however, the meat was still dryer than I'm used to.  Not happy at all.  

I love me some Aloha Kitchen, however, I was not a fan of this place at all.  I know they usually do a great job at the other locations so I'm not going to refrain from coming back just because of this experience.  This location, however, needs to get it together and step up the service!"}
{"text":"As many times as I come here, I can't believe I've never done a review yet!  I thought I made one months ago, but I guess I was wrong!!  Tonight I came by as I always tend to do when I'm ready to cheat and have a delicious meal that reminds me of back home.   This location, is literally a few blocks away from my house and super convenient...super bad combo if you're looking to lose weight!

This location is in a strip mall along with businesses like Thelma's, Rubios and GNC.  It's in the northeast part of the Sunset Station parking lot and across the street from Walmart.  When you enter the location, you feel like you've stepped back into a Hawaiian oasis.  Well, at least what outsiders envision Hawaii to be!  Thatched looking huts that drape over the tables, pictures of leaves and flora adorn the inside.  I actually like the details.  Really helps pull in the theme and type of food you're about to eat.  The staff is usually friendly and nice. I really enjoy Judith.  She's been behind the counter for years and always remembers my name.  She's super enjoyable to talk to and super attentive.  

For dinner, I got the Aloha plate for $7.99 and (2) spam musubis for $1.99 each.  As you may know, spam musubis are rectangular sushi cakes, rice and spam, wrapped in nori, or seaweed.  Aloha Kitchen dresses the spam up with teriyaki sauce.  The spam was fried perfectly, little crispy, the teriyaki sauce was sweet and tangy, bringing a pleasant and flavorful experience with each bite!  To me though, the rice tonight was a little too sticky which means they probably put too much water when cooking it.  I'd prefer my sticky rice a little dryer than what I tasted.  The glue that held this snack in was the nori, super crunchy and gave a little sea taste to the musubi.  Super good!  

The Aloha Plate comes with two scoops of rice, chicken katsu, teriyaki chicken and teriyaki beef.  I always enjoy this meal!  The chicken katsu is breaded with panko bread crumbs and fried:  super crunchy and flavorful!  The teriyaki chicken and beef were both excellent.  One thing though.  I think it might be too much teriyaki in one place.  I hope it evolves someday to include another type of dish to break up the teriyaki.  Could be a little overwhelming at times as of right now.  

All in all, I love this place.  The service is on point, fast and friendly.  The food for the most part is delicious and makes me wanting more!  It won't be too hard.  I live super close!  If you're in the area, go tell Judith Rockne says hi!  Then check out their delicious food."}
{"text":"I must admit Hawaiian food is a great way to end a shenanigan-filled weekend in Vegas. Hearty and full of carbs and protein, it pretty much could be a soupless alternative to pho as a hangover helper.

I ordered the Pork Lau Lau since I've been craving it for the longest time. It comes with two scoops of rice and macaroni salad. The pork came out tender and the taro leaves were nice and soft. Not bad for Vegas.

It's in a random strip mall next to UNLV, prices are pretty affordable for what you get. People keep mentioning the Adobe Fried Rice Omelette? Guess I'll have to try that next time I'm in Vegas. And knowing me, I'll be back sooner than later...

P.S. I remember seeing a banner for a student special too if you still have that Student ID of yours!"}
{"text":"The cook must have been sick that day. I ordered the Pork Adobo and Chicken Katsu platter with macaroni salad that one afternoon. The Adobo Pork was so salty and a hint of vinegar taste, the Chicken Katsu was over fried and was dried throughout. I couldn't even finished 1/3 of the food and gave up.
Money wasted."}
{"text":"My husband and I always go to this restaurant. Because this is only one we both like together. I like the musubi a lot.usually I order kalbi combo.its fit me and my 2years old daughter. The food is fresh. My one of favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"Edited. See below. 

I work graveyard and was trying to find a different spot to eat. I heard this AK was going to be 24hrs from the other AK on Decatur. Since I do like Hawaiian food and my co-worker is also from Hawaii we figured why not? 

After midnight we have to enter through the Bar side. Ok, no big deal. 
The cashier was friendly and greeted us. I believe her name is Paris. Hi Paris!
I ordered Oxtail soup.
Co-worker ordered Fried Rice Omelet.
Mine comes out first, Gigantic Bowl of Oxtail Soup and 2 scoops of rice. It was packed with flavor! Could really taste the ginger broth. Really good!
I was tearing up my first piece of oxtail. Bones to the side, as Paris walked by and asked if we needed anything I pulled out a piece of plastic from my soup bowl. I placed it down. And she was shocked. I wasn't really upset about that piece. It clearly was a piece of plastic from the vacuum sealed package. But when I pulled out another larger piece of plastic I started having second thoughts about the cooking staff. 
Now I know accidents happen but clearly this was just careless. 
Paris insisted they make a new one. And she also gave me a free spam musubi for my...troubles?
The second bowl was clear of distractions and had extra rice. 

This was more of an experience rather than a review. So just a word of caution. Look before you eat. 

Yes I'll be back to eat there..it's convenient and the food is good. Regardless of what happened. 

I'll update my Star rating after a few more visits. 

Sorry, I didnt take any pictures.

Edit: I've been here a few more times since my original review. The food is still good. Nothing lingering inside my plates or bowls. 
Adjusted my 3 star review to 5."}
{"text":"You have to come here on Wednesdays or Saturdays and order the Korean Galbi ribs. Delicious!! The spam wasubi is bomb if you can get there early enough to get some.  The food comes out fast and the people here are great!!"}
{"text":"The food was great and the service was phenomenal! The food seems to be actually local as a very good portion of the patrons looked to be Polynesian. I had the Mix Plate #4 Bulkogi and Teriyaki Chicken combination and we also had some of the Manapua (Char Sui Bao) balls...can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Attended their \"grand opening\" event today. I came to watch a performance but decided to place an order for my family to eat in support of this event. My sister in law and I ordered right after each other so the cashier put us on the same number. About 30 minutes later my sister got her food and I asked about mine. They said it was still cooking. There were several people (about 10 people who placed their order after me that received their order (including some family members who ordered about 15 minutes after mine) 

I waited another 15 minutes and they said they were waiting on one more item. Once I received my bag in inspected and one order of wings were missing as well as a macadamia sauce. They said they had released those in a different bag with a different number because they thought we were together?!! How is that even ok even if we were part of the same group? This was a to-go order and we weren't going to the same home! So another 10 minutes goes by and we just ask for a refund. I had 3 hungry kids and asked if they could just give a refund but give the kids their food at least so they could eat. They said no!! I couldn't believe it. I am a business owner and I understand that the event brought in a load of business that they probably weren't prepared for. I wouldn't mind waiting a bit had I known the wait time OR if 10-15 people behind me didn't get their order first but this wasn't the case. Great customer service would have been to offer a free meal (at the least) for our next visit but their was no kind of initiative for any resolve. (After one hour and fifteen minutes!) Their was absolutely no \"aloha\" here. We won't be back and either will any of my family (which was about 20 of us)"}
{"text":"Love this place! Use to come here all the time after school , conveniently located right next to UNLV. Their meats are good everything tastes fresh suggest ordering the Mix plate along with their shanghai lumpia. portions seem a litlte small compared to other hawaiian food places but i sitll recommend it."}
{"text":"Call them 15 minutes before closing since I live only 5 mins away only to be greeted by. We don't take anymore pick up order, if u can make it before 10 then it's fine. And halfway through ordering he said no more BBQ meats. If you don't want to cook anymore since you are closing just say so. Last time I ever ordered here. Shit Why be complicated??"}
{"text":"You know that hole-in-the-wall Mexican/Chinese/Italian/Indian/Etc place you love that has pretty solid food and reasonable prices, the people are friendly and the decor is...hole-in-the-wall?

Well, add Aloha Kitchen to the list as your hole-in-the-wall Hawaiian place.  The are friendly, relatively fast, priced for the beer budget and quite tasty indeed.

Like a ripe pineapple ready to be eaten, Aloha Kitchen, um, Aloha Kitchen...I really have no idea where to go with the pineapple setup there.  The whole pineapple thing just seemed apropos to the Hawaiian theme and, oh well.

Try it, you'll like it."}
{"text":"After a night out of the crazy vegas life, came into this place with an empty stomach and a hangover. SO GOOD and pretty cheap. 
adobo fried rice omelette? the best I have ever had. huge portions! and the tapsilog is really good too."}
{"text":"Adobo Fried Rice is my favorite.
Local Plate is good too.
Saimin is popular with the kids."}
{"text":"A new favorite when ever I visit Las Vegas. Went here for breakfast two days in a row. Got the breakfast special tapsilog the first day and the next day the adobo fried rice omelet. Both dishes were excellent. 

The location has a feeling of home and cool island style decorations.

The prices and service are great to. I'll be returning soon. What next to try?"}
{"text":"I'm super disappointed! The Aloha Kitchen by UNLV is much better. The mahi mahi is so gross! No flavor, covered in some weird egg dough mixture, vomit.  The kimchi is the only thing that didn't taste bad. The beef was so tough and had an old taste...the chicken was bland and cold. That fish is awful! The macaroni salad smells spoiled. I will not be back. The staff was friendly, too bad the food sucked!"}
{"text":"Really, I don't know how anyone could NOT love this place!! I can have the adobo fried rice omelette over and over again! My friend ordered his adobo fried rice with sunny side up eggs... it looked GREAT - that's definitely my next adventure! 

We need one in CA!!!"}
{"text":"I tried this location for the first time today. I ordered the beef bowl and lumpia. It wasn't terrible and filled me up however it was not as good as the Sahara / Decatur location. The lumpia was overcooked and the beef bowl did not have much sauce on it!!! It's worth the extra mileage to go to the other location!"}
{"text":"The best Hawaiian food in phoenix. We go about 2 to 3 times a month. I always am impressed with how nice the young kid at the register is. I always get the special and have left overs for lunch. Thanks for the good food."}
{"text":"Banans Mac pancakes from this place is the only one on the mainland close enough to Boots & Kimo's  ... The breakfast plates are bomb too"}
{"text":"I have to start off with we have been eating here for 8 years plus. Today we ordered take out for our staff and had a very rude awakening. When we brought the food back to our business the order I thought was half complete. The portions were about half of what they have always served. I am talking about everything but the rice was like a half order. The combo plate was absolutely the worst I have ever had except the chicken. I actually wanted the combo box but was told that they didn't have any mahi mahi. WTF a Hawaiian joint with no fish, they should be ashamed. called and called and cant get an answer. Tell yah guys what I don't know if there are new owners or they had a bad quarter but I wont be back."}
{"text":"I had heard about this place and we finally got around to getting here. I wish I had gone there sooner. The food was awesome, amazing. Nice, small mom and pop-like family place. Wasn't crowed when we for there in the afternoon. Walk in and order at the counter and the food will be brought to you. Other than that don't expect it to be a place that waits on you. Some people might get confused and expect that. Menu isn't always up to date so check for recent menu posting on Yelp. Downside is some items that you see online or may have had at other Polynesian places aren't available other than Saturday. A little inconvenient but the food was good regardless. Ordered the mixed plate #3 and the JR special with some island wings which were awesome. Highly recommend the JR special. Glad we made it to Aloha Kitchen finally as we will be constant customers. Just try to make it on a Saturday as it seems there are more food options available."}
{"text":"Okay granted this is my first time here. As a native Hawaiian born, raised and residing in Hawaii (on vacation for 2 weeks) I was 'ono (savoring) some homestyle soul food. So I found this restaurant. I ordered the Hawaiian Plate (one pork laulau, kalua pig, two scoops rice and one scoop macaroni salad) which was reasonably pieced at $10.25. However my plate had oil from the kalua pig at the bottom with was unappealing. The laulau was sitting it water (oh my!). It was so bad I couldn't finish my plate. One can say you can't compare the two (home vs mainland) but at least prepare it how it's supposed to be. By the way - there's not one thing \"aloha\" about this place."}
{"text":"Oh man. This place will be the death of me. I ate here for lunch 3 times in the past week. The food comes in large servings and is always filling. I don't think there has been a time where I was ever really disappointed with my food either. It's so good I randomly start craving it throughout the day! 

My favorite thing to order there is the Kalbi Ribs. It comes with plenty of kalbi, two scoops of rice, your choice of mac salad or kimchi, and sauce for the ribs all for $7.99. I don't know what it is about it..but it's so dang addicting! If you are looking to save some money, their chicken teriyaki is pretty good too. You can get that in the student special which is only $4.49. 

Feeling like eating just a snack? Get a spam musubi! They are quite addicting and quite delicious. You can get a decent sized musubi for $1.99. 

What you waiting for? Go get some lunch at Aloha Kitchen right now!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love their food.  I've eaten here dozens of times and will continue to do so.  BBQ chicken, chicken katsu, kalbi ribs, I could go on and on. 
Try a spam misubi.  It is the bomb."}
{"text":"I eat Hawaiian food at least once a week and I go into this place and they try to nickel-and-dime you charge you for teriyaki sauce stingy with the other sauces you know there's three other Hawaiian place right next to this 1  those will be the ones I'm going to I never got charged for teriyaki sauce or stingy sauces. I hope that $0.50 was worth losing somebody eating there once a week with my whole family"}
{"text":"I wasn't very fond of this place at all.  I still much prefer the one on Sahara and Decatur.  The cashier seemed uninterested and the food really wasn't prepared as good as the other restaurant.  I can't say that I would go back again unless there wasn't anything else on that block to eat."}
{"text":"This place is delicious!!!! There are so many options to choose from. I usually get the teriyaki chicken and the chicken katsu from here. The portions are very generous. The staff here is wonderful. Don't forget to get dessert! The guava cake is my favorite!!!"}
{"text":"Do not go here!!!!! Originally from the 808 and I come here quite often because I miss local foods. But after tonight I will not be coming here again! Just lost a regular customer forever. Tonight I made a phone order like I usually do and I ordered a chicken katsu with a large drink on the side. I came in and paid for my food and drove home. (Mind you I live on the other side of town) I got home and I noticed I was missing my side Mac Salad. I gave the store a call to notify them that they had forgotten my Mac Salad on the side. When I called, the receptionist picked up and gave me attitude saying \"oh I forgot\" really!?!? No apologies were said and she also said \"well there's really nothing we can do\" I had then got fed up with her attitude and asked to speak to a manager. The manager got on the phone and didn't even give me a chance to speak. He was like \"I heard what happened and all we can do for you is give you a side of Mac Salad when you come back here\" on top of that he kept asking me \"what would you like me to do for you\" but says that's all we can pretty much do. I mean why would you even ask me that question in the first place if you can't promise me anything!?!? Ridiculous!!! He was very rude and he also didn't apologize for their mistake!!! Which pissed me off even more. To top things off, when I was on the phone with the manager he was like \"how ironic that you called about this because supposedly there is another customer that just walked in here with the same issue about a week ago that was in the store picking up his Mac Salad that they forgot to bag. I know it's really not a big deal because I understand that people make mistakes and sometimes forget but what really got to me was their lack of customer service and how rude they all were. Coming from Hawaii I thought they would show me some Aloha and treat me like Ohana but I guess I was wrong. The workers here need to be more respectful and learn how to do their jobs. It's not that hard to put food in a bag with utensil's and side dishes. Not coming to this location ever again!!! There's a lot of other local food places here in Vegas and they will be seeing me a lot more."}

{"text":"So good...feels like your in Hawaii n food is amazing"}
{"text":"Although this is a Hawaiian restaurant they also serve Filipino food. With good service, comes good food. My go to dish will have to be the Adobo omelette fried rice which is rich in flavor and always a must eat when your in town. I usually dine in and order one to go for the drive home to Cali. Hopefully you guys open one in California"}
{"text":"I love this place!  Been coming here since 2000 when I moved here from Hawaii.  Whenever I need my comfort food I order the fried saimin. It's the best! But today I tried the hot wings and I'm upset I haven't ordered them before because they're so ono! A little sweet with some spiciness to it. And still crispy too.  I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The only Hawaiian food I've ever had was Poké from a buffet. Hardly authentic. Took the bus from the strip over to Maryland Parkway. From there it was a 3 minute walk in the hot desert sun.
Went in and was greeted with a smile and an \"Aloha\"
I had no idea what to order so I asked the woman behind the counter what was good. She mentioned some combo with Korean Kalbi  and then the Adobo fried rice omelette as local favorites. Not in the mood for Korean food , I got the omelette. Took it back to my hotel and dug in....I have no idea what Adobo means but if it were up to me I'd say it means Amazing. The restaurant was clean, service was prompt and courteous. This might have to become a prerequisite like In N Out on my future trips to Vegas."}
{"text":"I literally had to wait almost 20 minutes for 2 student specials and there was 1 person waiting before myself. I don't understand why the long wait when there was no one there."}
{"text":"Always the best. Been going here for 20+ years. Always order 2x the Mac salad. Ramen is flown in fresh. Owner and family are very very nice. I used to go here 3 times a week, but I moved too far away. Now once a month I'm lucky to get there."}
{"text":"This location appears to be much bigger and cleaner. I came in around lunch time and there were about three employee's working so I knew the food was going to take a while to be made. I ordered an adobo omelet fried rice and my fiancè got an adobo/ katsu plate with a medium drink. Our food cost $19.99 with tax. They have us a number and our receipt, and we sat down at a booth. Their drink station is next to the booths and you get free refills. There weren't any condiments available like hot sauces or additional Katsu sauce, you'd just have to ask the cashier and they'll give you a small cup filled with it. We waited for about 25 minutes for our food, which felt like a really long time. I guess something happened because the people who ordered after us got their food first, and they even ended up leaving after they finished their meals before our food came out. Once our food finally came out I was pleased with the adobo fried rice omelet portioning. The Aloha Kitchen next to UNLV has smaller portioning so I suggest to come to this Aloha location to get your monies worth."}
{"text":"As a local Hawaiian You come in here to get some Hawaiian food and to expect great customer service from the employee's but you don't. Where is the Aloha? Some days I come in and uncle working the register is on top of his game! He is so nice and urgent with your order. But most days when there's other cashiers there's no greeting or smiling. Last visit I came in and they didn't even say anything, just stood there and awkwardly waited for me to order. My regular is the adobo fried rice omelet so when I told the guy may I please have the adobo fried rice, in a rude way he responds, \"you mean adobo OMELET?\" ...awkwardly I said yeah but was thinking isn't that the same thing? I don't know but braddah made me feel dumb when he emphasized the omelet so I just ignored it, paid, and sat down at my table lol 

Food is good, after coming here for 5 years their adobo omelet has been consistently delicious. However, their BBQ chicken has changed. It went from being juicy to just plain dry over the years so I stopped ordering it. Their drink machines is free refills and they sell Aloha juices by the can. To a certain extent their food hits close to home, only improvement should be some of the cashiers."}
{"text":"Adobo fried rice omelette..nuff said...really though, they have Filipino and Japanese dishes and we always have to start here when we visit the LV...YOu must try if you're in the area..."}
{"text":"Here with Andrew Jason , for a quick meal on way to airport.
Food is very good , I had the teriyaki combo plate , it was delicious , Andrew had the garlic gravy  chicken plate , great flavor , the Hawaiian style macaroni is very good and authentic. 
Price is very reasonable ."}
{"text":"I've never been to an aloha kitchen that charges you extra for teriyaki sauce they don't even have it on the cables to their customers. If the company is that broke they have to charge extra for teriyaki sauce maybe they should close the doors, worst place ever will never come back to this location."}
{"text":"I've been craving their food since last time I was in Vegas and it was just right that I came back ... craving for more!

Since the friend and I were running low on energy... plus we had to watch a show in an awkward time... why not load up now!?

We did just that...

I finally tried their Adobo Fried Rice Omelette with a side of spam masubi... with coconut juice... HEAVEN. I ate 75% of the omelette... it was honestly delicious! I also inhaled the spam masubi!

Friend got the loco moco (since he never had it before...) and he devoured it. He wanted to trade when we got our food... I said no. Yes, I'm mean... but when a girl is hungry... you don't mess with my food!

Our total for all our stuff... $20+ = our cheapest meal this past weekend!

Definitely try it out folks... it's so close to the strip... you won't get disappointed!

PS: they had tapsilog for $4.99... was so tempted to get it but that would be gluttony overload. Next time... hopefully they'll still have it!"}
{"text":"Food:
- Chicken katsu was as good as home (Hawaii). Sauce was pure katsu sauce.  
- Hawaiian plate: Kalua pig with cabbage was flavorful but the Laulau was bland. Mac salad was ono.  
- Saimin was alright, not a fan of its char sui. 

Customer service:
Got my order wrong and did not apologize. I actually apologized to her for having to take my food back.  

Location:
Lots of parking, clean and cool ambience.

Would I go back?
If there's no other place for great chicken katsu and Mac salad then yes."}
{"text":"Cheap and heavenly food is found at Aloha Kitchen. You truly feel the aloha vibe here from the moment you walk in. Their staff are so kind, and with the amazing plates of Hawaiian food, you're bound for a good time. There's nothing too fancy about this small place. You order at the counter, sit down, and they bring out your offer. Even for our fairly-large group they didn't take long.

The group's consensus was positive for our dinners. We all though that it was an awful lot of rice and not enough of that macaroni salad and meats for those of us who got the plates. I was introduced though to rice seasoning, the best thing ever for white rice! I ordered Mixed Plate #2 which had bulgogi and chicken katsu. Loved the katsu but the bulgogi was a little too fatty for my liking.

Only spent like $10 on dinner which is totally affordable for Phoenix. The food I ate won't hinder me from returning again and trying more of their Hawaiian menu! Aloha to all!"}
{"text":"Been here plenty of times when it packed with people and I've ordered big amounts of food and got my food at a good time but today I came in for two spam musubis and waited nearly 20 minutes and the place was empty so idgi"}
{"text":"First off, Hawaiian/ Filipino restaurants hate me, i.e., they're not vegetarian friendly to begin with. Second, the guy at the counter who I'm assuming to be the owner or manager needs to fine tune his customer service skills on the real though. I tried, key word TRIED, to order the Student Special (which is chicken teriyaki bowl with rice and veggies) minus the chicken. He refused and said I couldn't do that. The end result was that I was made to order a side of rice and a side of veggies, which he then instructed the kitchen staff to add teriyaki sauce to and put in one bowl. It's the same thing dude!! 

I was not a happy camper because he made the process of ordering a vegetarian friendly meal so exasperatingly difficult. I could forgive the poor customer service if the food was good, but it wasn't. The veggies had way too many onions and there wasn't enough teriyaki sauce to go around. It just tasted way too plain. End result: I ended up picking at my bowl and left hungry."}
{"text":"This place is legit so close to the college and they have the student special everyday and it's under 5 bucks too!"}
{"text":"I love Aloha Kitchen, especially this location. Every time I visit Vegas, I always enjoy coming here and ordering their Kalbi Combo (kalbi, katsu and teriyaki), as well as their spam musubi. I've never had a bad experience. The food is great, always fresh and the staff is amazing. For $10, the portion was HUGE and I ended up taking it to go to my hotel. Even eating it cold as a left over, the food was still delicious! I recommend this place to anyone looking for great Hawaiian food.

They recently renovated their store from my last visit last year, and it definitely gives off a new feel while keeping with the same food quality and service."}
{"text":"Got there have beef plate and teriyaki. The chicken was soft and very tender. There Mac saled probably the best of ever had at a restaurant. I forget her name but the nice lady who took my order is always a pleasure to talk with."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE! 
The people that work here so incompetent it blows my mind. I don't know how many times I've come here where they screw up my order, (and usually I let it slide because it's down the street and I know I'll go there again) but this is the last time. The food is poor quality (which the prices reflect) and the service is horrible, and as I said before the staff is incompetent. It really can not be that difficult to get a single order correct. Once I got home and opened up my to go order it was completely wrong and when I called to receive some sort of compensation or even just a delivery/swap of the intended order they denied it and acted as if I was out of place (because I don't know what I ordered right?) this place isn't worth your time, and you shouldn't spend your money here. There are a number of other establishments in the area that will actually leave you satisfied."}
{"text":"Always friendly , island style grindz. Pretty good mix on the menu selection, Hawaiian plane is satisfying. Happy Customer here :)"}
{"text":"Great Hawaiian so far from the islands. Good price for a lot of food. Try the combo meal and soda pop is free refills so it's quite a deal."}
{"text":"Good food, but super slow service. Was here over an hour before the food came. They need to hire more workers, especially during a basketball tournament weekend."}
{"text":"My family and I love this spot! Whenever we come to LV from Cali we have to put this place on our agenda for breakfast,  We're sprung on the Adobo Omelette!  Oishi! Masarap! Ono! Delish!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Hawaiian plate. The portion was plenty, but it wasn't the best Hawaiian food I've had. The staff was friendly and the restaurant was clean."}

{"text":"Amazing food and generous portions. Great staff and clean dining area. I like the rice topping. I see why they've been there for 30 years."}

{"text":"Food here is always good but the service experience tonight was very disappointing. UNLV's last class session ends at 9:45 and we happened to end class earlier tonight. We came at around 9:40pm before closing. My friend got his food first and began eating at around 9:50. 

The lady at the register, Florie told us that they were going to put the food inside of a to go box which was fine and that we were allowed to stay and eat in the designated area. When I finally got my food at 10pm, one of the other workers told us that we had to leave. My friend was in the middle of eating too. Unfortunately, we ended up leaving and packed up. There were about two people waiting for their food. I don't know why it was a problem. Where's the Aloha at???"}
{"text":"Of the things that I tried here, it made me wish i attended UNLV.

The adobo fried rice omelette really does get mixed reviews: either so-so or delicious. It really depends on how it's made apparently, because when I tasted mine...it was AMAZING.

There wasn't much chicken, but i felt like it was because the sheer amount of the rice. I think the omelette was AT LEAST 6 eggs, weighing in at about a pound and a half. 

Also tried their mac salad, tapsilog, and chicken katsu and all were delicious. 

We came in a large group and they were really nice and patient, which was a plus."}
{"text":"Don't call in an order because you'll get there and it won't even have been put in yet. Then you won't have time to eat and have to switch it to go.. Then you'll be late going back to work.. All while not even eating lunch. So let's review one more time. 
1. Call it in and let them know what you want.
2. Get there to pick it up.
3. They don't even tell you it wasn't in fact put in and will be coming out a little late.
4. Sit there for 20 minutes waiting on your food.
5. Go up to the counter and finally figure out you will not be eating on your lunch break.
6. Not even get offered a discount, coupon, any gesture that says.. Hey we messed up. Let us make it up to you.
7. Return late to work
8. Not eat
9. Try not to let it ruin your day because you are now starving and wasted your lunch break.
10. Leave review. 

I have now posted the 10 steps of eating at the sunset location of Aloha Kitchen. Save your money people and go to rasta j's"}
{"text":"I was told by a coworker to try this place out, since then I've lost count of how many times I've been back for their local plate. The food is amazing. Definitely recommend them."}
{"text":"Eek! Even the newly remodeled interior couldn't save this place from their horrible customer service. The two people working the front had no smile, monotone voices, and a bad attitude. 

The one guy called my order out when it was ready, rolled his eyes that I took a minute to receive it and then he handed it off to me without making sure that I had a hold on the food, then didn't say a word once it finally got to me. 

I got the adobo fried rice omelette, which was okay. It definitely needed much more than a squirt of Sriracha sauce to make it taste better. I received the omelette messily thrown into the to-go box. Presentation is also part of the equation for an overall good experience and it was not there for this dish. At least it was a generous portion for a semi-decent price.

They sell Hawaiian Suns here, so don't forget to buy one to enjoy with your meal! 

If I'm ever near/on campus or need a lunch in between class that isn't fast food, I'll go here but I'll definitely be cautious of the staff. Other than that, there are other places for Hawaiian fare around the area that's probably a bit better than here."}
{"text":"This place was superb!!! Good all around, the food is amazingggg. Everything was cooked right there and then and it didn't feel like it was cooked this morning or an 2 hours ago. 5 stars from me, I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Aloha Kitchen is damn good Hawaiian. After mourning the loss of my favorite Hawaiian haunt in Tempe, my wife suggested we try Aloha Kitchen. They've been there forever, but I hadn't ever made it over.

They're fantastic. Great teriyaki chicken: perfect tender and fresh and a great sauce, great macaroni/potato salad (the combo is nicely balanced, and no celery or relish, which are dealbreakers for me). They also whip up some mean bulkogi and have a great kalbi special pretty often. 

Overall, they're exceptionally tasty, well-priced, and even the mini plates are more than enough food for me, and I can put away a lot of food."}
{"text":"I ordered the Tempura Combo...comes with Teriyaki Chicken, 2 Shrimp Tempura, a Tempura Vegetable patty sort of thing, 2 scoops of rice and 1 scoop mac salad. The Veg Tempura patty thing was way greasy and still had some uncooked batter spots, the shrimp was okay but I've had better at least they weren't greasy. The Teri Chicken was just meh, it was edible but really didn't have much taste. The mac salad was very ordinary, not like other Hawaiian restaurants where the mac salad is addictive. The rice was rice. 
I've been to another Aloha Kitchen in the SW part of town and loved it but this one is not even close. I doubt I'll go back especially since Ross J's and L&L are so close."}
{"text":"heard a lot of great things about this place. so while i was in vegas this past weekend i had to swing by.

cute little hawaiian joint, i ordered the adobo fried rice omelette. holy crap! that thing can feed 2 people. the portions are very generous. it was very gooood too! i do have to say it doesn't taste like real adobo but it's still pretty damn good.

i'd come here again most definitely!!"}
{"text":"I've been looking for a good Hawaiian place since I'm from the islands. I looked online and it had decent reviews. We decided to go about an hour before closing for take out. I ordered the katsu and teri chx mix with mac salad and she ordered the teri beef and chx mix with mac salad. We took it home right away and ate. My plate was ok, not what I was used to. The katsu sauce was more like cocktail sauce and the mac salad had potatoes in it. Her teri beef was very dry.  About 2 hours later we both started feeling queasy. I was up all night in the bathroom with FOOD POISONING. Idk if it was the mac salad or the katsu bc I was way worse than she was. Never again will I eat here and I'm going to contact the management. It shouldn't matter if its the first order of the day or last of the night. Quality should be consistent."}
{"text":"This is the my favorite Hawaiian restaurant.  Especially Saimin Soup, no place can beat this place."}
{"text":"I hardly ever go to this location and today I went there with friends. It was empty, overpriced and the beef on the rice was cold. Very disappointing. The one on Decatur is on their game though! :)"}
{"text":"I'm really torn between 4 or 5 stars. I'm hard pressed to give 5 stars when you have to order at he counter then seat yourself. 

And like other reviewers if I was driving by I might have just kept going. It's an old drive-thru of some sort. 

Wrote the place down on a list for the next Vegas trip and don't remember where I heard about it. 

The food is MUCH better than it has a right to be!

On recommendation of guy at counter the wife and I both ordered the Kalbi combo-Kalbi ribs, tonkatsu and chicken teriyaki.  (The most expensive thing on the menu at $10). Also ordered a spam musubi. 

A lot of really good food. Do try it."}
{"text":"I fuckin love this place. It's a routine every time I'm in Vegas I have to eat here. Their lechon kawali dish is fuckin awesome dude. No lie. That shit will fill you up like a damn balloon. You feel me? I fucks with them. Oh yeah, they're adobo fried rice omelet is fire also. Workers are very nice. If you don't eat here you's a bitch!"}
{"text":"I love Aloha Kitchen. Been coming here for years. The chicken katsu is great. Highly recommend. Make sure you bring an appetite. The mix plate portions are pretty big."}
{"text":"Super tasty lunch spot! Look like the combo lunches (different proteins like beef or chicken) with creamy mac salad and a little orange slice. Will try the spam masubi next time. Simple mom and pop place, support local businesses!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places hands down! If it's your first time order The kalbi combo or the kalbi rib plate! Tip ask for an extra side of kalbi sauce and put it on your rice"}
{"text":"This place is amazing the food is delicious make sure you stop by and check this place out it's even been on triple d's on the Food Network with guy!"}
{"text":"Neil the Cashier is nice,and personable. The food quality SUCKS. they DONT have Sticky Rice anymore, there to over priced, there bathroom was dirty!!! I will not go back ,thank you"}
{"text":"We had: spam and eggs, bento box, and a teriyaki beef bowl - side order musubi and eggs (for bento).  Was good....tables were a bit sticky but I can overlook it. I think this location has better prepared food than the one on sunset. Would be back....."}
{"text":"We ordered: bento, cheeseburger, kids chicken meal, side order lumpia and musubi. 
Bento: rice had yucky fish flake furikake (I'd rather have plain furikake), too much sauce on such little Teri beef, chicken and spam were ok.
Cheeseburger - pretty good but fries weren't fresh
Kids meal chicken - good size can't complain 
Lumpia - frozen but good
Musubi - too hot the rice and soggy because too much sauce (rice should be room temp not straight out the steamer or else for sure gonna be soggy)

Overall it was ok but not really like home cooking. Island Flavor and Kauai Cafe both out do this place.

One thing is the restaurant is clean and very spacious!"}
{"text":"Believe it or not I heard about this place while I was in Honolulu! No kidding. I met the owners sister while working temporarily in Hawaii over the holidays. When the woman I was speaking to found out I was from Mesa she asked me if I'd heard of Aloha Kitchen. I had not...which is weird as I only live about a mile from the place! But it's hidden behind Nello's so I'd never noticed it before.

Soooo...we finally went tonight. Super Ono! We tried the Bulkogi...so flavorful...slightly difficult to cut on the plate but so goood. The teriyaki chicken is so moist and tender...and the char from the grill just adds to the flavor experience. The Katsu was very well done. I've had Katsu at some places that was so over cooked you could re-do the bottom of your shoes with it. This Katsu was very well done. 
My one Step-daughter had the Won ton Saimin...she loved it. She couldn't believe someone would serve a bowl of soup so large. She wondered was it for all of us or just for her!?! 
We ordered one Manapua after I explained to my husband what it was. He'd never heard of it before. I of course had some when I was in Hawaii. After he saw one come out of the kitchen he had to try it. I just wish they had some with other fillings.

Even though we had more than enough to eat we tried some pie. Oh my...what a treat. So so ono! Hubby had the Coconut Macadamia and I had the Chocolate Haupia...Unbelievable flavor.

Our only comment would be...keep the food the way it is but put some character in the decor. We'll probably get the food to go in the future as the restaurant it self is blah looking. The Hawaiian magazines to browse are cool...as are the other things on the counter...but the tables and the ho-hum look to the walls don't make me want to \"be there\" or draw me in. It needs a warmer more Aloha look.

But all in all...Mahalo to the sister for letting me in on a place I had in my own back yard...Man I had to go to Hawaii to find out about it. Go figure!"}
{"text":"Honestly I don't ever write reviews, but I had to for this one. I'm literally still at this extremely slow and disorganized establishment waiting for our order. It has now hit the 40 min mark and still no  food. We have received however the worst customer service, so there's that. Never coming back, and would not recommend."}
{"text":"Great place to grab breakfast, the adobo omelet is a personal favorite. The hospitality really shows as soon as you walk through them doors"}
{"text":"Delicious, good size portions. Serious comfort food that hits the spot."}
{"text":"Came here for a midnight craving and was served by a girl named Paris. She was sooooo sweet and had the best customer service. I wasn't even expecting good service or a fancy dinner but she made me definitely want to come back :) plus the pork adobo fried rice was BOMB"}
{"text":"this place is tucked in a corner of what one might think is an abandoned strip mall at first glance. unless you are searching for this place you would probably drive by it every other time without a thought. Now the food however is worth the stop. i love Hawaiian food and this place makes damn tasty food. asides from the aesthetics of the location and the overall decor, my one major problem with the place was that they had no spam on their menu. no army base stew, no musubi, no spamwich, not even a basic hot Hawaiian breakfast. i mean come on! other than that, worth a stop just for the food experience and i would go back because its hard to find good authentic un-western influenced foods in arizona."}
{"text":"effin delicious grub is what you will get here! Ridic amount of food ,without breaking the bank. Seriously. Got two large entree orders and three side apps to snack on all for $25, cannot beat that. You will have leftovers for sure! B/f had the Bulgogi and he loved it. I had the sweet and sour chicken, it was just as good. yummy.. no complaints at all, salad was good and their macaroni-potato salad was killer as well. The menu has Hawaiian, Korean, Chinese..all the food i cannot get enough of. We stopped in and ordered it to go, people working there and very friendly and we only had a short wait for the food. We will for sure be back, so glad i found this place...really is a hidden little treasure."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! Great food and good price. The employees are very sweet and although it takes awhile to get your food, you can be sure it's freshly made. This place gets my island cravings."}
{"text":"Ate there yesterday with my sister. We both shared a bowl of saimen with BBQ pork in it. After we ate it we both started to get an itchy feeling in the back of our throat and I started to get bumps on my lips. We are both allergic to shellfish. My sister then asked if they put any shrimp in the broth, they said yes. Aloha kitchen you can kill people who are allergic to shellfish and other seafood, you need to place warning on your menu!"}
{"text":"This may not be the best Hawaii-Style local food on the planet (you can only get that in Hawaii), but it did bring me back to Hawaii with the flavors and I would be a regular if I lived in Vegas.

My BFF had Spam Musubi. I haven't had it since Hawaii because I don't eat spam anymore...but I was close to trying it for nostalgic purposes...but I refrained.

I had the beef teriyaki with white rice and a Passion Orange Hawaiian Sun. The sticky rice and drink brought me back to my childhood. We always kept Hawaiian Sun in the house. I still have yet to find the drink on the East Coast."}
{"text":"Tucked away in a sleepy trip mall, this restaurant is a hidden gem. The food is good, plentiful, and cheap (the $5.95 teri-chicken sandwich combo is the best bang for the buck here or anywhere). The service is friendly and inviting. It does get busy during the normal lunch rush and on Saturdays, but it's well worth the wait.

By the way, there's free fruit infused water for those folks not interested in a soft drink, but not completely boring, either."}
{"text":"I honestly don't know what the hype is over this place.  I've eaten here a few times and don't get me wrong the food tastes good, but it definitely doesn't stand out compared to other Hawaiian restaurants like 808 Mixed Plate, Island Flavor, or Aloha Specialties.  The place does have Filipino bias as well for some of their dishes compared to other Hawaiian spots...ie Adobo Fried Rice Omelette and other Filipino dishes I can't spell.   I've tried the garlic chicken plate here....and I honestly probably wouldn't order it again...the brown gravy just wasn't appetizing on this dish.  I've also tried the kalbi which seems on par with restaurants like L&L.  My favorite dish was the portuguese sausage, eggs, rice...but you can't really mess that up.  If I'm on a time crunch...I'd probably come here and order to go....but I definitely don't think I'll be craving food from Aloha Kitchen...just like I don't have urges to go to L&L when there are other options out there."}
{"text":"Had a craving for fried saimin and Aloha Kitchen is near my office so I thought I'd give them another shot- haven't been there in a while. Uh-uh. No more. Fried saimin portion was small and half of the dish was filled with cabbage and onions. Uhhhh- I wanted fried saimin and not fried cabbage and onions. If u want good fried saimin/noodles may I suggest Island Sushi or Island Flavor. My fault- didn't want to drive my lazy okole to one of the Island places. Aloha Kitchen- no more. If Aloha Kitchen was in Hawaii they'd be out of business. 

One star and that is being generous."}
{"text":"I ordered one local plate and a chicken adobo omelette.


Local Plate:

Rice only comes with the plate upon request? Really? The reason I was given was \"because a lot of people don't eat it.\" I've never come across that anywhere else. 

Also, the macaroni salad comes in a 4oz sauce container. Come on.

The chicken and beef were pretty good, however. It's a shame you don't get much more than that, and it's definitely not worth the $8 it comes out to.

Chicken Adobo Omelette:

The portion for this item was actually a good size, enough for two, so I was happy in that regard.

The combination itself was decent. The fried rice and egg were good, but the adobo itself was on the dry side.

If only I had known about the adobo sauce, which I did not know was, again, available upon request only.


The food was alright, the portions are hit and miss, but the general tomfoolery of my experience gives me a reason to never come back."}
{"text":"Love coming here! The food is always great and the prices are good too! Good place for lunch friendly staff and very clean. I always get the teriyaki chicken and coconut shrimp combo it's excellent! Big portions and comes with have choice of garden salad or macaroni salad and 2 scoops of rice. Kid friendly and kid approved food!"}
{"text":"I've been in here to pick up orders for the office, but today was finally the day that I actually decided to eat here. You know how it goes...time escapes you and before you know it, you're faced with a late lunch and an absolutely ravenous appetite. I got the #4, which is a combination plate with chicken katsu and bulgogi, with a side salad. Huge portions! I was nervous about the \"tropical\" salad dressing at first, but it's pretty much a lighter Thousand Island. The bulgogi was flavorful (read: salty), but drier than the dirt cooking outside in this Arizona heat. The chicken katsu is what brought this up to 4 stars. Not the best I've ever had, but probably one of the best I've tried around the Phoenix area.

This place has been busy every time I've gone, and the food is fast. As in, I hung up the phone and immediately left for the 10 minute drive there. And when I arrived, all four of our orders were ready.

I would recommend the chicken katsu. I also tried the Manapua, which was decent. Like a lot of the other reviews say, the place is a little hidden and very unsuspecting. Will probably come back to try something else."}
{"text":"Amazing!! I'm from Kaua'i, born and raised. Have lived on the mainland for 15 years now and have never found such an authentic Hawaiian eatery. Everything from the simple atmosphere, to the owners and staff. And the food. My god the food. The laulau is as good as any I've had back home. Lomilomi salmon, amazing. Kalua pork, katsu. Saimin. And the freaking manapua. This is the ONLY place in AZ to get the real deal Hawaiian food. Can't believe it's taken me so long to find it."}
{"text":"I visited Aloha Kitchen on my lunch break 2 days ago (05/09).  I called ahead of time, placed an order over the phone for to-go and was told it would take 15-20 minutes.  Pretty decent timing for a lunch hour.  I showed up in about 10 minutes and decided to wait in-store since it was fairly hot that day, and it came out 5 min later.  Again, timing was good.  The restaurant is clean, there are a bunch of friendly faces on the staff (they didn't look like they hated their job), and there is a water tray sitting in the corner for you to grab your own at if you don't want to indulge on sugary drinks.  

Food: I ordered the mix plate, which online says it is a combination of chicken teriyaki, beef, and mahi-mahi.  When I opened up the box of food at work, it was chicken teriyaki, mahi-mahi, and PORK.  Not sure where the communication went wrong over the phone but I read exactly what was listed on YOUR menu.  If it has changed since what your website says then you should update it for your customers who don't have time to sit in restaurants for lunch so they order what they want.  I don't eat pork, so that got wasted but everything else was pretty good.  Also, I saw many reviews talking about how delicious the macaroni salad is so I was excited for that.  Not so excited when I ate it though.  It tasted like rotten mayonnaise.  I definitely couldn't finish that. I am unsure where the reviewers got the idea that it was delicious at but it literally tasted how a dirty garbage disposal smells.  It was awful.  

Is this going to be my first choice in food next time?  No.  Would I return?  Yes maybe but would be passing on the mac salad and making sure I am ordering the right item since their online menu is inaccurate.  I don't enjoy paying $9.50 for a meal that is only going to be eaten 60% of the way."}
{"text":"Such a great establishment! Generous portions, and a very extensive menu. We ordered the curry chicken katsu combo that comes with a side of yummy macaroni salad. The macaroni salad was heavy on the mayo so it was really creamy. The curry had huge chunks of carrots and potatoes which I love! The curry was had just the right amount of seasoning and the chicken katsu was crispy and tender on the inside. They include 2 scoops of rice, some cabbage for health, and inside the curry also included tender pieces of chicken that have been in the pot for a while so it's so tender! It practically falls apart. 

All of this was for about 10$. I will for sure be coming back to try the adobo fried rice omelette. 

Their menu is quite extensive and they also had oxtail ramen! I totally recommend this place if you're in the mood for Hawaiian or some small Filipino foods."}
{"text":"This place has been my favorite restaurant since I was a kid. Absolutely love the manapuas, the island wings and pretty much everything else. I hope this place never closes. In the fact they need to expand more throughout the valley."}
{"text":"After reading all these amazing reviews I decided to give it a try. I ordered the number 7. The chicken with terriyaki was amazing as well as the rice but for the beef they gave me it was not good. It was really thin and dry and tasted like the scrapings off the grill. Everything else was great but the beef ruined it for me sorry"}
{"text":"We love this place and travel from Gilbert about once a week to eat here. IMy boyfriend always gets the Saimin and I always get the coconut prawns with teriyaki chicken, it is amazing!"}
{"text":"We always grab a bite here when we land in Vegas. Usually a morning flight so the adobo fried rice omelet hits the spot... Lately I've been getting a bento box and a spam musubi. Bento box consists of beef & chicken teriyaki, a slice of spam and a scoop of macaroni salad over rice. Don't forget the furikake on top of the rice. All of it is delish. Food is cheap. Service is good. Order at the counter, they give you a number and your food is brought to you. Can't go to Vegas without stopping by Aloha Kitchen."}
{"text":"About twice a year when I go to Vegas I always make an effort to eat here. Their adobo fried rice is always a recommendation among the locals. But my personal favorite here is the chicken curry and spicy chicken and gravy with custom topping of fried eggs. But u can't go wrong with anything else that's on their menu. Place can get busy at times since its next to UNLV. I always go here for breakfast so crowds or lines are never an issue"}
{"text":"Aloha!

PROS:
-get plenty parking
-right next to one bar
-not too much people
-the place is clean
-get free water
-cheap

FOOD:
-i only get the chicken teriyaki plate, cause its under $5
-really good on the portion
-chicken was not dry.. and not under cooked
-rice was a little over cooked
-the water was filtered 

CONS:
-the music (hiphop / edm) was too loud (maybe play hawaiian music?)
-COLD! A/C must be on full blast

-other than that.. this is my go to for a quick and cheap lunch.. the staff area always nice.. and the place is always clean !"}
{"text":"I really wanted to try this place after reading the yelp reviews and seeing these pictures. We ordered one of the combo plates and it was no good. The bulgogi was really tough and dry and the chicken katsu was over fried. The chicken was fried waaaay too long it turned gray inside and dark crust was falling off. It was nothing like the golden crust on these other yelp pictures. When it comes out of the fryer like that .. it needed to be tossed out. The mac salad was also kind of a miss. I have had better.

Update.. Be wary of giving a low star review.. the owner will leave you a really sarcastic compliment as I can see the bad compliment they also left for another user. 
Good restaurants can have a bad day. My experience may just have been bad timing. Get over yourself."}
{"text":"Love it! I have been eating here since 2005. I have eaten at many Hawaiian restaurants in town and Aloha Kitchen is the best.

I have tried many dishes here and none disappoint. There are a few that especially stand out. The chicken katsu is the absolute best katsu I have ever tasted in my life. It is not some thin breaded, greasy chicken piece of crap like most places will serve you. It is a juicy chicken thigh breaded to perfection and sliced up. This is definitely my favorite dish. Also, the BBQ chicken is quite tasty. They always grill it fresh which is awesome, but it can take awhile to get to you. It takes about 20 minutes to make, but it is worth the wait. Can't forget the student special; for under 5 bucks you get a teriyaki chicken bowl and a drink. It is enough to fill you up on the cheap.

On the other hand, I have been there a couple times and the food was not fresh and it tasted like straight shat. This only happened to me a couple of times out of the hundreds of times I have been there. It seems this tends to happen when it is busy during lunch time, so try to avoid lunch time."}
{"text":"OK,
Just HOW DID I SCREW THIS UP!?

One of my all-time favorites here in Arizona-land and I don't have a review on this place?

Say What?

With that said, let's get to it shall we? This is definitely a long time in coming!

One word here:  Fantastic!

Look, I lived in the state of Hawaii for a few years.  After moving from paradise, back here to the mainland, I missed the food sooo much.  While I now live in AZ, I found this little hole in a wall called Aloha Kitchen.  Look, this isn't the place where you're gonna take a hot date, unless she's from Hawaii herself, but if you want real authentic Hawaiian type food, with a tad of Hawaiian atmosphere thrown in, please do yourself a favor and stop on by.  You won't be disappointed.

My favorite here, and I'm addicted to it, is their Teriyaki Chicken.  Simple, no fuss no muss.

It's a great place for a quick lunch or even a simple dinner.

If and when I ever move from Arizona, I'll certainly miss the food and people of Aloha Kitchen.

Rant Out,
Mahalo!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for Hawaiian food.

I recommend the \"Bulkogi Plate,\" which is charbroiled beef in Korean barbeque sauce.

The \"Teriyaki Chicken Plate\" is also very good (chicken is all white and tender).

All plates come with two scoops of steamed rice and one scoop of macaroni potato salad or plain-jane salad (pshhhhh...).

The portions are very generous. Entrées range from about $7 to $9. The \"mini\" plates -- which have smaller portions -- range from about $4 to $5.

Also, the staff are very nice. :-)"}
{"text":"my first visit here (take out) was about a month ago and I had little eggrolls and the chicken katsu/teriyaki beef combo.
1. mac salad was not edible. had a funky sour taste. no bueno
2. katsu was good. crispy but not dry. sauce was alright.
3. beef was gummy and had some sort of off putting taste. would not order this combo again
4. eggrolls were just not flavorful. and a little greasy too.

second visit was today (take out)  and tried their loco moco w/eggs over easy
1. please know the difference between over easy and over hard, cause i definitely got over hard. took the loco out my moco! 
2. gravy was a little funny tasting. bummer cause the gravy holds everything together along with the runny egg I never got.... so sad....

maybe i'll try the soup next time....."}
{"text":"If you have a hankering for Hawaiian cuisine, this is seriously hands down the best place in town. When I'm having a bad day, this is where I go for comfort food. They have plate dishes that are consistently the best, and specials that are so good they sell out practically every single day. 

It's been owned by the same family for as far back as I can remember, and they really take the time to get to know their customers and let them know they appreciate their business. Seriously such a hidden gem, I can't even begin to tell you how much I love this place!! Chicken Long Rice on Wednesdays and Saturdays keeps me coming back year after year. 

Worth checking it out. Support a local business and your appetite will thank you for it later!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and thought the first time was a fluke. Surely they were just being nice to me with this giant plate of food since it was my first time in. On my return visit today, it was the same, awesome!!! My son and I ate a great lunch and enjoyed visiting with each other. I am going to try the Spam Musubu one of these days, looking forward to that taste of the islands.

Great job, keep it eclectic, keep it funky and keep it fun!!!"}
{"text":"Service was quick and the food was great! Authentic Hawaiian food.  I ordered the lumpia and the spam masubi and was impressed.  I would definitely recommend anyone who likes Hawaiian food to swing by and give it a try."}
{"text":"My go to place for hawaiian BBQ, their mac-salad is on point and I usually get their chicken katsu. Prices are fair since its so tasty. Combo plate has plenty of portion."}
{"text":"I had my first experience here a few months ago, it is defiantly a place I would never go to on my own judging by the outside. My friends wanted to go so I said alright, I was pleasantly surprised. The food was pretty tasty, reasonably priced, and the portions are huge! I would defiantly go again."}
{"text":"Food is usually mediocre, at best. The worst are the cashiers. The guy literally rolled his eyes at me for ordering something else that wasn't on my order when I called it in. Then proceeded to tell me \"well, that's gonna be another 10min wait!\" Uhh.. okay, not a big deal? Acting like he had to catch the chicken and kill it to make the chicken katsu!  people, if you hate your job as much as your face shows, get a different job!"}
{"text":"After attending a wine identification specialty class, and finishing off a ridiculously delicious bottle of Terra d'Oro moscato on the school lawn, with a guy and girl from my purchasing class, the three of us needed to kill some time before we were good to go home.

The Union was closed, none of us were in the mood for Mexican, and for obvious reasons we needed to walk to wherever it was we were going. The girl from my class said she was down for Hawaiian, so Hawaiian it was! 

Walking in, the place is a combo Filipino/Hawaiian place, with some combos of those cuisines available. The place was empty when we went (5/24/11), but it was 6 PM - I don't think normal dinner time is the same around UNLV. Our food was delivered relatively quickly. I got the Kalbi combo - Kalbi ribs, chicken katsu and chicken teriyaki with two scoops of macaroni salad. The kalbi and katsu was decent, not the best I've ever had but still good. The teriyaki was, hmm, maybe had too much cornstarch in the sauce because it had a very thick consistency, more so than usual. 

The service was friendly. The owner (?) cut in on our conversation to chat with us about what we had been talking about, so yeah, the service was friendly. Because we had been drinking prior to coming here, when the convo turned a lot less PG, I decided it was time for us to probably leave so we didn't disturb the people coming in to eat. Overall, the food was decent enough and was a good place to kill some time before we were good to go home. It's convenient to get to from UNLV and not stupidly overpriced, as so many restaurants around here are, so that's a big plus."}
{"text":"Looking at the review, I had high hope for this place. 

Came here last week around 130p, and notice there were quite a bit of smoke from the outside. Was afraid it would be smoky inside, but it was OK.

I ordered the teri beef and chicken plate lunch, and a side of musubi. 

First off, I had a tall young man helping me.  The service was extremely friendly and efficient as I got my food within 5min or so.  

The plate lunch actually wasn't bad.  I believe this restaurant is easily a solid 4.5 star.  So here's what could have been better.  The beef was dry, and you can tell it's been sitting for awhile.  I'm assuming they do not make these when ordered, but it was premade already.  As such, it just look and tasted it was leftover.  On the chicken, it was actually better as it was tender and very flavorful with the sauce.  However, in this case, the sauce was a bit overbearing as it was a bit much, and too much sugar added.  If they can tone that down, it would have been better.

As I had excessive sauce for the chicken, it came in handy as the musubi had disproportional amount of rice ratio.  As such, it was OK, but didn't have much taste.  So I dip the musubi directly with the sauce, along with stuffing some smaller cuts of chicken in it to make it tastier.  Perhaps they can add some teri sauce, egg, or some other flavor?

As mentioned, I do believe this place can be a solid 4.5 star, but in my experience, they could do better.  But these things are easily fixable, so I still do recommend giving them a try."}
{"text":"Oh man, where do I begin?  Service?  Stellar!!  Local?  Ya bra!!  The food though...I mean,  the food is unbelievable!  I love the Katsu Chicken, and my wife does the Teriyaki Chicken with a side of grilled Shrimp...it's a lunch special.  They have traditional Hawaiian drinks and desserts, and the Spam Musubi is the BOMB!!  Ray, the owner, is still there after 30 years and is always coming by to say hello and make sure that we're happy.  The best part is that lunch is about ten bucks for a totally filling, totally satisfying meal!!  Don't worry if there's a line out the door...it goes SUPER fast!!  Enjoy my fellow food lovers!!!

{"text":"My girlfriend had posted on her Facebook and would check in to this place when she would go to LV.  So I wanted to try it out myself with my hubby.  We went there one year, and I was so wanting to try their adobe fried rice omelette that everyone keeps talking about.  It was pretty tasty and very different that's for sure.  We enjoyed it.  It would def be cool if they were to open one up in Southern CA."}
{"text":"Love the food and their service is A++ Highly recommend!! The menu is very extensive and never disappointing"}
{"text":"Man oh man do I love this place. The past three times I've been to Phoenix I stopped here. Everything I've tried is delicious! Their chicken katsu, teriyaki, and ribs are perfection. Their mac salad, unlike the Hawaiian place I go to in Tucson, has great flavor. I suggest ordering off their specials board-you seriously cannot go wrong there. Believe me when I say this-if the prawns are on special, GET THEM. Their specials run out so it's good to go early. My only complaint about this place is that they don't sell spam musubi every day. Oh and that they don't have a Tucson location."}
{"text":"First of all, if you're a true lover of adobo, you MUST try the adobo fried rice omelet! It is probably one of my favorite omelets I've ever had in my lifetime. This place is a mixture of hawaiian and filipino breakfast, which I love. I also had the Hawaiian plate which came with kalbi ribs which were tender and just the right amount of sweetness to savory. Portion size is just enough to make you full. Next time I am in Vegas, I am definitely stopping by again."}
{"text":"Horrible service when theres a lot of people. Expect a wait of over an hour. Honestly if they werent so cheap and hired more staff members, people would be happy.

On the other hand, food was great. so +1
Location was very easy to find and parking was not so bad, another +1
Food ordered took over an hour to get to us, so -1
Staff was very unfriendly, another -1
Finally, the person working the register, wanted to charge me for a cup of water since i forgot to ask when i ordered. WHO DOES THAT?!. -1 for sure.

Overall, foods great but with such horrible service.
This place has a lot of potential but they lack a good staff."}
{"text":"Can't get enough of their adobo omelette and also the short ribs! A must stop for every Las Vegas visit"}
{"text":"I wasn't sure after seeing a 3.5 star rating on Yelp how good this would be. I ordered the adobo fried rice omelet.  It was great. The adobo was shredded in ever mouthful. The egg was super thin. It was a massive portion! I loved it. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"So much food!!!!! If you even think that the regular portion might be too much, it is and just go for the mini portion. There food had good flavor and I love the sauce. The only thing is the steak was kind of fatty. But hey that didn't stop me!"}
{"text":"Probably the only place in Arizona that serves legit Hawaiian food.  The pork steamed buns are amazing and truly something to try. Nice little hole in the wall with friendly service. Great place to grab lunch in the middle of the work week."}
{"text":"Ran out of banana pancakes.. ordered longonisa and sat down. It turns out they ran out of that too. I ate 2 eggs over easy with rice. Plain plain plain plain. And 27 cents for gravy? Are you kidding me? Not to mention the attitude every staff member has. Never again will I come here. I'd rather drive to Henderson."}
{"text":"I go here every day after class for my usual of kalbi ribs, spam musubi, and lumpia. The food is good here and the portions are equal to the price.  Spam musubi is $1.99 each, kalbi ribs are $7.99, and lumpia are $2.99 for 6.  Overall it's a clean restaurant, has good Hawaiian/Filipino food, and great customer service.  I highly recommend because as I said it keeps me coming back at least 2-3 times a week."}
{"text":"Stopped by here before heading back to LA. I saw Yelp reviews and pictures but nothing prepares you for their portion sizes and how good it tastes!! 

First off, parking is not bad. It is located in a plaza which has lots of space and other food places if you wanted to try something else. 

The inside is very spacious and looks like they might have remodeled some parts. When we arrived it was pretty busy but we were able to find a seat quickly. 

I ordered the Local Plate. The portion size was HUGE! It comes with 2 spam musubi's, teriyaki chicken, and teriyaki beef! Would definitely recommend! 

My bf ordered the Adobo fried rice omelette which is pretty popular on the menu. Again the portion size was huge and way bigger if you dine in. I thought it was okay. Too much rice in my option and not enough of the omelette. Also the flavor was bland in the fried rice. I added hot sauce which made it better.  Our friends ordered a different type of meat and I felt like that one had more flavor. 

Overall great place to try if you are in the area!!"}
{"text":"Excellent katsu chicken.  Large portion."}
{"text":"Went here to pick up dinner on a Friday night hoping to find a good hawaiian place near my house, unfortunately I was ultimately disappointed. 

I tried to order the Kalbi combo which comes with the kalbi ribs, the chicken katsu and the chicken teriyaki.  They were out of katsu and informed me it would take 15 minutes for the grill or deep fryer so I said no worries, I'll just take 50% kalbi and the other 50% chicken teriyaki which is fine with me since I like those 2 more anyways. I do have to say that the woman working the register was very friendly.

As for the food aspect when I opened it up at home, the portions were abysmal.  The kalbi ribs basically looked like the majority of the meat had been cut off and just left the bone with a sliver of meat on it.  Was really disappointed, the chicken teriyaki was mediocre but for 10 dollars for the plate it definitely wasn't worth it as a whole and actually as I write this review I'm still hungry.  Until they increase their portions/quality of meat to match other hawaiian restaurants I just can't recommend this place as you would be better off going to the Sunset Station buffet across the street or to Island Flavor for some real hawaiian food."}
{"text":"Been driving past this place for years and finally decided to drop in on a Saturday night around 730pm. There's nothing fancy about this place, its pretty basic but nicely decorated in a Hawaiian tropical theme. Probably around 25 tables inside. Staff was extremely nice, welcoming, and friendly.

They have a pretty standard menu for a Hawaiian place, plus a mix of some filipino dishes. I ordered Kahlua pork and chicken katsu combo. Kahlua pork was tasty but a bit salty for me, and chicken katsu was really good and tender. Macaroni salad was good as well. Portions are huge, you won't be able to finish a plate unless, well....you eat too much!

I'll be back. This place is located near the Swap Meet at the front of the parking lot near Charleston."}
{"text":"Aloha oe!  

Had time to kill while running errands in Phoenix today so decided to pop in to Aloha Kitchen.  A little out of my way but so worth it.

Enjoyed the charbroiled chicken teriyaki \"mini\" plate .. only one scoop of rice, the killer wicked potato mac salad and a smaller portion of teriyaki chicken.  Nice Char flavor on the chicken although I found the sauce rather sweet for my taste.  The chicken is chopped up dark and white meat and I'm a white meat fan but I \"suffered\" through it!  FYI, the skin is on the chicken.  Wonderful sticky rice with teriyaki sauce on it.  But the potato macaroni salad is worth writing home (or Yelp) about.  Loved it in all its carb loaded goodness.

Service is slower than a typical fast food joint, but hey, if you've been to Hawaii, you can dig it. 

I'll go back and try more items on the menu.  I'd give the chicken teriyaki a 3 out of 5 (due to meat quality and skin still on) but the potato mac salad gets a 4.5.  Presentation,  my plate was too colorless to be super appetizing looking.  Overall a 3.5 but I'll go with a 3."}
{"text":"Since I moved from Hawaii, I am always looking for a great home food. Heard this place wasbto go. First day I ordered to go, I got sick. I had salmon plate, teriyaki chicken plate & vegetarian saimin. Not sure if it's from Aloha kitchen food, so I decided to try it again next day. 

I think I got over charged.  $10 for side order kalua pig...hm.
Laulau was very delicious, lomi salmon & chicken long rice was super salty. On the other hand, fried saimin was way too blend. I actually used some of the poke sauce to make it bit more tasty.
Overall, it was an ok experience. Now that I have tried some of their dishes, I know what to get & what not to get."}
{"text":"They are so amazingly rude and impossible to work with  - \"We are out of the ribs on the kalbi combo\", \"Fine. just put something else on e.g. kaluha pork, or chicken\", \"No we can't substitute anything\" - well then I can find a different place to eat - this is the second time I boycott them; last time it lasted 2 years, this time it is FOR EVER!!"}
{"text":"Great Mom and Pop kind of place.  Staff is friendly (with the exception of one lady, but haven't seen her in a while).  Authentic Hawaiian food.  I always order the chicken kastu with bulgogi (sliced sirloin steak) and my buddy orders the JR chicken and chicken katsu.  Katsu has great crunchy breading and tender meat inside.  For around $10 you get a plate of tasty awesomeness that is also generous in portion size.  Definitely a neighborhood favorite especially after a hard workout, or anytime you feel like chowing down."}
{"text":"I always in the Kalbi Plate with Kim Chi. Chicken Katsu has too much breading on it. And I don't care for there style of bbq chicken grill chicken with bbq or teriyaki sauce put on it."}
{"text":"Besides from all the fast food places surrounding campus, this is the place to go when I want a meal I won't feel *too* guilty about and something that is quick. I usually order the miso soup with rice when I'm in a hurry/want something light, but I also adore the chicken katsu and mahi mahi dishes.

Not being too big of a fan because most of their food is a tad bit greasy for my tasting, its convenient for me because I could simply walk across the street from a study break from my classes and it's not a far distance. This location isn't that busy, but usually has a college crowd that passes through."}
{"text":"Hawaiian food with a line of people out side. Mostly Asian people. Was a good sign. And food was great! The Punch was really good. The chairs were only ok."}
{"text":"So the boyfriend and I have been busy with moving into our own place in the area and today, we decided we'll stop by the Aloha Kitchen for dinner.

First of all, we're not exactly new to AK.  We always grab lunch at their stand during the Aloha Festival.  With that said, this was our first time actually going into the restaurant.

My boyfriend got a combination plate of bulgogi and chicken katsu while I had the kalbi [short rib] plate.  For a $19 meal, I wasn't expecting too much --- maybe the same expectation as other Hawaiian eateries this valley is blessed to have.

And I was wrong.  The portions are a bit smaller, the meat was a little dryer for the boyfriends plate, and everything was mediocre.  I must say though that my short ribs were delicious!  

Overall, it wasn't that bad but it definitely doesn't taste like their booth at the Aloha Festival!"}
{"text":"My rating is 3.5 stars.  I ordered Mix Plate #2.  I normally do not order chicken at restaurants because vast majority vulcanize the chicken, cook so overdone, hard, and dry.  But because so many people liked the chicken katsu in the reviews, I picked to combo #2 so I could try the chicken katsu.  But I already read the reviews where some people said it was dry dry dry.  I ate with 13 other Mensans and their guests in their 1st Fri of the month Mensan Foodie meeting at various restaurants in Phx metro.  

When I asked how the Mensa organizer  liked her chicken katsu, she said it was tasty but \"VERY VERY DRY\".  Oh that is just what some reviewers said.  So right away I went to the cash register and told them that I wanted to make sure my chicken katsu is NOT DRY, and told them the reviews said it was dry and the lady sitting at my table just said it was 'VERY VERY DRY\".  I said try to fry thicker pieces for me.  She said she would tell the cook.

When my food came, it was still dry, but not \"very very\" dry.  I should have asked for only dark meat. Some pieces were more dry than others, and I could hardly find the meat in those pieces, seemed to consist only of breading.

My bulgogi was dry too and a bit too salty.  That is my reason for the 3 stars for the food, DRY MEAT.  The the taste was good, 4 stars.

I don't have rating for service, cos they brought my plate to the table within reasonable time for how busy they were.  We help ourselves to the water and tableware so no other service was needed.  No one asked if my chicken was OK, tho, after being insistent it not be overdone.  Only confirms my stance about not ordering chicken when I go out to eat, cos 90% of the time, cooks overcook it.  HATE white meat.  

I questioned whether the macaroni salad was truly \"AUTHENTIC Hawaiian\", and the Hawaiian lady said yes.  The CalRose rice is really good with the seaweed flake and sesami sprinkle that I found as a condiment on our table.  

I would come back and try other things with groups, cos food is tasty and of good value for price and portion."}
{"text":"There's Hawaiian food, and then there's Hawaiian food.  My introduction to such fare was in Hawaii, many years ago.  First was the inevitable luau which, although touristy, nonetheless introduced me to such foods as kalua pig, lomi lomi salmon, and taro.  Next came the \"traditional\" restaurant.  \"Traditional\" is in quotes because I'm not quite sure what tradition was being followed, but it was an attempt to offer some of the foods eaten by Hawaiians in the not too distant past, and even into the present.  I got my first taste of poi, which by the way is actually pretty good as a foil to the salty foods often served.  I then moved to a locals restaurant that served many of the same dishes, and fell in love with haupia, which when properly prepared is coconut heaven and when poorly prepared is coconut jello.  Lastly, I was introduced to the then new Pacific Rim (aka Asian fusion) cuisine.

Aloha Kitchen isn't like any of those places. 

The menu is representative of what is sometimes called local Hawaiian food, and caters to the large local Hawaiian community that has taken root in Las Vegas.  The food is an amalgam of Pacific Rim cuisines.  It is cheap and filling.  A typical meal is the mix plate, consisting of two scoops of white rice, a scoop of macaroni salad, and one or more items such as kalua pork, chicken katsu, and pork lau lau.  Spam is also a mainstay (spam sushi!), or try the loco moco (bed of rice, hamburger patty, eggs sunny side up, and a big ladle of brown gravy).  Health food lovers need not apply.

Like most such restaurants, Aloha Kitchen is very plain, and very inexpensive.  The Maryland Parkway location is near UNLV, and feels like a typical university hole-in-the-wall place.  Order at the counter, take a seat, and your meal will be brought to you.

Meal #1:  I had never had a loco moco before, and decided to give it a try.  Loco Moco is a bowl of steamed rice, with a fried hamburger patty on top, followed by a generous portion of brown gravy, and a couple of sunny side up eggs.  The rice was bland, the gravy was bland, the hamburger was bland.  Once is enough!

Meal #2:  I decided to try a typical meal - one of the many mix plate combinations.  In this case it consisted of kalua pork, chicken katsu, and of course rice and macaroni salad.  The kalua pork was salty but flavorful, good in combination with the bland rice.  The real winner was chicken katsu, a kind of Japanese fried chicken with a sweet barbecue sauce on top.

Meal #3:  I got the local plate: chicken, beef, Spam musubi, macaroni salad, and rice, all for the bargain price of $6.99.  The beef consisted of thin small slices of beef with a sweet barbecue sauce, on top of sprouts of some sort.  On top of the beef was a thin piece of chicken, skin on, sauted until the skin was crisp.  Both were very good.  Next, Spam musubi; I had to try it.  There were two pieces.  Each pieced consisted of a thin slice of Spam (about 3\" x 1.5\" x 1/8\"), fried until crisp, on top of a thick layer of warm rice with barbecue sauce, wrapped in a large sheet of seaweed.  It wasn't as weird as I expected, although the seaweed was too chewy.  I'd give it a mild thumbs up.



This kind of food isn't fancy; it's heavy on the fat, heavy on the carbs.  I love it!  Aloha Kitchen serves a decent representation of the stuff.  I have a feeling there must be better versions out there, but this one is pretty good."}
{"text":"This place is garbage. Save your money and time and go to island flavor!!!! Now THEY have REAL Hawaiian food."}
{"text":"The food is good and the atmosphere is Christmasy loud Music is in a playing. Good clean and good portions. Overall not bad for a dive strip mall. Hey client recommended it and he's Hawaiian so whY not!"}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for island foods! Hawaiian food is the closest thing I can get to Guamanian food so this is my go to place. 

The interior setting is okay, but the food is awesome. I usually order the BBQ chicken and my boyfriend always orders the Kalbi ribs which is soo good. Their kimchi doesn't taste authentic it's a little more on the sour side, but their mac salad is delish. I've also tried the chicken katsu, teriyaki chicken and beef. They're all great tasting as well, but the BBQ chicken will always remain my favorite."}
{"text":"Service and food is great but they really need to fix that AC unit. This is vegas as a business owner myself, customer service is the number one priority. I came in mid day and it was at least 80 degrees in there, cuz I could feel myself sweating. Recommended temperature for any business is 73-75. Take notes. They also need to learn how to mop because the floor is sticky. I'll update my review if I ever decide to come back in and this criteria is met."}
{"text":"Came in here and they told me they don't take credit cards for orders less than $5. Which is a really stupid up sale tactic. Not only that but there was a hair in my chicken teriyaki bowl.."}
{"text":"pretty easy finding this place since there a burger place near it that looks like a gamestop. the adobo omellette was really good, it was just a tad bit dry. nothing a little sabaw (sauce) couldnt fix. the cashier was really friendly and the vibe was really nice. i would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Well, wish I could say this place was top notch, as the service was good. The Manapua was very tasty as was the Macaroni salad. The chicken katsu was unfortunately the worst I've had in the valley. The Bulkogi beef was okay but nothing special. One thing that should be mentioned is they only serve dark meat and white meat mixed chicken in their chicken dishes, and white meat only is not even an option. So if you are pretty much white meat only person like me this place is pretty much a no go."}
{"text":"I had never had Hawaiian food before, so I wasn't really sure what to expect. Something with... pineapples?

My friend found my ignorance amusing and offered to order on my behalf.  He said some words I didn't know, and just a few minutes later, I had a large colorful plate in front of me, heaping with rice and vegetables and chunks of various cooked, BBQed, and fried meats. 

Fearless, I dove in. Some pieces of meat I liked better than others, but all of it was good and had a home-cooked feel to it. My entire Hawaiian feast cost less than $10 total. 

I was most definitely a fan. If I ever roll through Vegas again, I will pop on a grass skirt and go for another plate of mystery meat."}
{"text":"I used to always love this Aloha Kitchen, everything is made fresh, and everyone was super nice. But today was a different story. I ordered BBQ pork for my mom, and it didn't look anything like pork, it looked like beef, and it didn't even have any BBQ sauce on it. My mom took it back, they just argued with her, never asked if they could make her something else, never asked if they could refund her, the cashier just stood there and argued with her. In my opinion that's pretty rude customer service. My mom didn't ask for the manager cause her mind was just blown because of how rude they were. I'm probably never ordering from here again. Whoever the Liza gal was recently deleted the comment off of my facebook post. If that's what they call BBQ pork, I'd rather not. Thanks."}
{"text":"Extremely good value for your \"Hawaiian Style\" appetite.  They serve good quality food and really \"healthy\" portions.  I love the saimin (flown in from Hawaii), bulkogi beef and chicken katsu, oh, and the manapua (YUMMM!).  They're family owned and operated since around 1985(?)  It's truly a plate lunch paradise in the desert land."}
{"text":"I can say I conquered their pork adobo fried rice omelette and I am going to have to confirm that it is \"soo good\". It's literally the size of a super burrito. 

Aloha has a all the standard Hawaiin eats and a couple other quirky items to add to their menu. 

Very good cheap eats. 

They also have a pool hall karaoke bar connected to it."}
{"text":"let's just say that after 3 days of buffet, the act of eating was more like an empty ritual.

decided to take a trip to aloha kitchen for loco moco and masubi. their food hit the spot, fo sho, though it's not the best i've ever had. just enough to reawaken my love for carbs. :)

it was clean and simple. there is a karaoke lounge attached to it that had awesome happy hour. definitely somewhere cheap to go if you're in the area (leaves you more money to gamble away!)."}
{"text":"This place is a little hidden gem!  I have come to eat here a handful of times in the last few years of living out in the East Valley, however, I do not come as much as I should.  This weekend, I had my step-daughter, Kenzie and my daughter Riley with me. So we went on a food adventure as we often do when we have free time.  I ordered the special of the day (Saturday) Ahi poke and a side of pork laulau.  Ahi poke was seasoned well and had an oyster sauce type of marinade, green onions, onion slices and tomatoes. I can only eat so much oyster sauce in one sitting, I don't care if I am Asian or not- there are still some flavors Asian people don't like. LOL  The pork laulau is the real reason I came because they only offer it on Saturday. It does not look appetizing but once you get the taste of the pork it really does just melt in your mouth.  Kenzie couldn't stop eating it.  The baby on the other hand would rather eat some pepperoni's- she doesn't know what she is missing yet. Too bad today is Monday and they are closed, otherwise I would be coming for lunch today."}
{"text":"Came here wanting some Hawaiian food so we got the #3 which was chicken teriyaki and katsu and the #1 which was the chicken teriyaki and white fish. The katsu was way over fried! The breading was really dark and too crunchy and it wasn't seasoned so it didn't really taste like anything. Most of the chicken teriyaki was good but we had a lot of inedible really burnt pieces. The fish was pretty good. Not too sure if we'd get these dishes again though."}
{"text":"ADOBO FRIED RICE. 

Came here with folks on the way out of vegas. price is right and food is on point. tastes just like i came from a family party (filipino style family party) and decided to get creative with the leftovers. thats how the adobo fried rice omelet  came about. soooo good. shared a adobo and katsu with lumpia and it was enough for 3 people!!! (have it be we each ordered the adobo fried rice omelet to our selves not know the size of the portion.)

better than L&L but ranks up there with Homesyle Hawaiian out here in san diego. (MO dont worry i still prefer you over these guys)"}
{"text":"Had my favorite, the KALBI COMBO. It was sooo good! It comes with kalbi ribs, chicken katsu, chicken teriyaki, 2 scoops of rice and mac salad. The kalbi ribs are delicious with a sweet soy glaze. The katsu is also very good, really crispy with a tangy dipping sauce. For under $10 it's a lot of food at a great price. 

Aloha kitchen definitely holds me over until I can get back to Hawaii!"}
{"text":"Overview:  Being a UNLV alumni I of course have eaten many a meal at Aloha Kitchen.  It is cheap, but I'll warn you now, for each item that is of wonderful quality and taste, there is an item that is equally bland, fake, or just plain bad.  It is a Filipino owned establishment, so the Filipino items tend to be good, while the flavors that I grew up with in Hawaii are often a disappointment.  I miss Diamond Head grill, which was across the street from UNLV.  Their Hawaii food blew Aloha Kitchen out of the water, but the owners moved away and I was left with just the Aloha.

Location:  The restaurant is on Maryland Parkway, north of Tropicana.  For all you poor college students, it's to the east of the southern dorms, south of In and out burger, and north east of the architecture building.  When you're on campus, the strip is west of you.  Hopefully that helps.

Exterior:  Your standard strip mall restaurant.  There is minimal outside décor, glass store front, and a door.

Interior:  They are really going for the Hawaii feel here, but it looks nothing like any restaurant that I have ever eaten in whileI lived all my life in Hawaii.  It screams fake Hawaii.  Corny.  

Service:  You order at the counter for takeout and dine in.  If it is a takeout order, there are a few seats that you can sit in while you wait for your food.  For dine in, you get a plastic number that you take to your table with you.  You get your own drink and the only service I ever seem to get is when the food is dropped to our table.  Sometimes I wonder if I should even leave a tip for that.  The attitude of the service really depends on the workers.  Some are really friendly, others are just plain b####s.  The manager, an Asian guy, is the nicest guy.

Food:  Like I started off with, they make some really good stuff, and some really bad stuff.  The good stuff first.  They make some great Kalbi.  It is tasty and charred just the right amount to add the perfect flavor to it.  The Adobo anything will always seem to be a winner (adobo fried rice, adobo omelets, etc.).  

Now I will move onto the bad.  Musubis are simple and normally delicious, but I don't like the way they make theirs.  They make it fresh which should be a good thing; however, this does not allow the steam of what should be freshly cooked rice to soften the nori.  Now I've heard people say they like the fresh nori, but I feel the nori on the outside of a musubi should not be tough and chewy.  I'm sorry, but growing up with the stuff I am just against that.  The solution would be to just wrap it in plastic wrap as soon as you make it to trap the steam inside to soften the nori, then unwrap after about three minutes and serve.  

Also, they seem to use ready made sauces.  If not, then they have pretty accurately duplicated the taste of Kikkoman teriyaki sauce.  The thing that used to piss me off was that they would not marinate their meats (except the Kalbi).  If you ordered Teriyaki chicken, you would get a bland piece of chicken with Kikkoman sauce poured over it.  I used to work at some higher end Hawaii restaurants in my day, and when I saw this I wanted to throw my plate.  How hard is it to put meat into a sauce and leave it there for 30 or more minutes so the flavor gets in the meat?  

Summary:  I'm going to be as positive as I can be here and focus on the good.  The price is pretty decent and on most days the staff will be friendly.  What they made well taste outstanding and comes out fairly quick.  Since in Hawaii presentation equals portion size and not prettiness, the presentation here is great.  They give you a good amount of food for the money.  This is a blessing for any college student.  

Will I eat here again? No, since there are far better Hawaii restaurants in the Valley.  Would I recommend it?  Only to students who don't have a car and can't drive to Ross J's, Island Flavors, or the California Hotel.  This place is becoming more and more a chain.  This saddens me.  Why can't a restaurant with some actually Great Hawaii food become a chain?"}
{"text":"Best stateside Hawaiian meal since visiting Maui. Brought back memories of Aloha Mixed Plate (AMP)."}
{"text":"Meh. 

On my 2 separate trips here, I've seen roaches in this place on BOTH occasions. Need I say more?"}
{"text":"Great hawaiin food! The restaurant itself is has a nice island theme with a staff that are really friendly"}
{"text":"When I moved to Colorado for a couple of years, the kalbi ribs from Aloha were one of the things I craved the most.  I used to work near AK on Decatur and Sahara and would order the kalbi ribs twice a week.  Served with a huge amount of thinly sliced, slightly sweet ribs, two scoops of perfect sticky rice, amazing Hawaiian mac salad and a small container of thin sweet sauce that I pour on my rice...this is one of the most incredible meals you can order.  I visited L&L a couple of times trying to replicate the ribs, but they aren't in the same ballpark.  When I moved back to LV (actually Henderson) I was pleased to see an AK on Sunset, we have already visited a handful of times and the food is incredible.  Katsu is great as well...but you may as well just go Kalbi crazy."}
{"text":"Janette and I split an Adobo Fried Rice omelette.

Seriously this thing was as big as my forearm but as thick as my calves. Ginormous but I think it tasted too much like home cooking that I felt like I could make this haha. The adobo fried rice was very vinegary and still a bit sticky, and less fried rice like, to a point where it felt like it was just adobo and rice wrapped in an omelette instead of fried rice being placed in an omelette

Still the price and volume for food you get is good."}
{"text":"The service is excellent! The mini portion is huge & delicious! The place is packed with regulars and I can see why."}
{"text":"I came to pick up some teriyaki chicken before driving back to LA. Food quality and taste here was eh. The teriyaki was smothered in sauce and piled on top of rice. It was a little salty. It seems like they just carelessly put together the food. 

Given its location, its intent is to serve students. Hence, generous portions, cheap prices and whatever tasting food."}
{"text":"Lets just say im big on customer service. And honest, I dont care how shitty the food is, if the customer service is good, I might try this place a second time. Im sitting here waiting for my food order because I payed with my card already. I planned on leaving cash tip as my order comes. But forget about it. This little girl in the front counter is rude, short with words, and cuts her eyes at you as your order. To top it all off, she is too busy yelling at her co worker and barking orders and throwing her hands in the air that she cant hear me calling her. Maybe shes ignoring me. Or maybe shes too engrossed in yelling at the poor guy behind the counter regarding his training and what he should have been training in. Honestly, I dont care anymore. This little heifer needs to learn some manners and some common sense. The only saving grace is that the food smells good. Im sure it tastes fine. Aloha, please get rid of your rude cashier/trainer/ankle biting guard dog and hire another student who I can give a tip to.

Edit: spam musubi was awesome. Kalbi plate cause some annoyance. The kalbi were thin slices of short ribs that were burned because it was so damn thin. Had no flavor. I didnt know that it came with katsu which was great, and chicken..... the chicken was gross. So gross even the neighbors pitbull wouldn't eat it. The best part of it was the side of kimchi it came with. So sad. If you have any suggestions to a better hawaiian bbq place. Please let me know! 

A thought on that waitress, im sure after all these crap reviews about her she should have been gotten rid of.. BYE FELICIA!"}
{"text":"I have heard about this place for a very long time now. Everyone was telling me how great this place is. I figure today is a good day to give it a try. 

We got here at 11:30am on a Sunday morning. We ordered a noodle soup and another dish. Both of them were a bit tasteless. The cashier was so busy answering the phone that she left out food at the kitchen counter for a while. Overall, the food/service was ok. However, we are excited to come back on Saturday and try their loco moco (first come first serve). Perhaps we will like that better."}
{"text":"I have literally grown up on this place. It is my favorite spot for Hawaiian plate lunch overall, not just in the Valley, and nobody else compares. I remember when this spot was half the size and they still made authentic shave ice. It has changed a bit on the inside throughout the years, but it's still the same great food. I grew up on the mini bulkogi plate and manapua (steamed pork buns), but now that I gave up red meat the terri salmon with mac salad is my jam. My kids love the mini terriyaki chicken plates. The island hot wings are great too. Don't forget to pick up an Aloha Maid canned juice and slice of Haupia pie or guava cake for dessert! Ray used to always have classic Hawaiian music playing, but I honestly wasn't mad to hear J.Boog and other modern Hawaiian reggae music playing last time I was there. Aloha Kitchen will always have a special place in my heart!"}
{"text":"had the bulkogi mini plate. very cheap at $5, but it's not really bulkogi - more like a thin steak with very sweet barbecue sauce - and the rice was too sticky. the lone bright spot of the meal was probably the potato-mac salad."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. Had the Chicken katsu..best I've had that is close to how they make it back home. Portuguese omelette and pancakes was ono. Definitely would visit again when in Vegas. Service was good too."}
{"text":"Great find! Love supporting local businesses like this, the food is GREAT and we can't wait to go back soon!"}
{"text":"You can't go to Vegas and not have breakfast at Aloha Kitchen.  Their adobo omelette and dishes are the best breakfast and hangover food.  It's even better to take homea and eat later after that long 4-5 hour drive."}
{"text":"In Vegas, hungover and craving some good Filipino/Hawaiian food?  Aloha Kitchen hits the spot!  Though I was not hungover during my visit, my custom adobe rice order with adobo meat and egg on top could be the perfect remedy to a hangover or a hungry stomach, and highly recommended.  

Aloha Kitchen has some of the best Filipino adobo meat around.  The texture is comparable to pulled pork or lau lau.  Get their popular egg omelette filled with fried adobo rice, a must have eat when you're in Vegas or to go order on your way home.

If you want another taste of heaven, get their banana pancake.  I'm not fond of bananas or banana bread, but this will make you a fan.  The sauce combined with fresh doughy pancakes with a slight hint of banana will make you want to come back for more.  With these two awesome dishes alone plus their good service and great home cooking, Aloha Kitchen should get no less than 5 stars."}
