{"text":"Had the Aloo Gobi. It was very good. The coriander really sets it off nicely. The veggies were just a little on the soggy side but I did have about a 15 minute drive home. I am a vegetarian and there was a piece of chicken in the meal despite the fact it is a vegetarian dish. It was easy to see and not eat. Not the biggest deal. I am looking forward to going back but will mention the meat restriction explicitly next time."}
{"text":"Great Food!!!!
The first restaurant in Charlotte where I actually enjoyed the Kabobs. We ordered boti, chicken and beef kabobs and they were really good. The green chutney that came with the food was really good as well and we had to bring some with us for the left overs.
The owner came out to greet us and asked for feedback which was nice since they want to improve. I would definitely visit this place again."}
{"text":"If you are thinking about going here, think twice. Food was barely acceptable; the entrees (4people eating) did not come out together, some food was cool. The service was poor; wait time for our order was 40 minuets. We were the only customers at 6:30, so service should have been much better. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"This place is arguably THE most authentic Indian restaurant in town. We went to Royal Biryani and Kabob this past Saturday and here are our thoughts:

The Good:
- The Food:  is arguably the best Indian food we have had in Charlotte. We have tried The Taj, Copper amongst other Indian restaurants but if you go by the sheer authenticity and quality of of the food, Royal Biryani and Kabob wins, hands down. To our knowledge, there isn't any other place that offers more authentic Indian cuisine in town.

The Bad:
- Service : We dined in with 2 kids and 2 adults. They do not exactly have dedicated serving staff. They had 2 folks handling the takeout and dine-in business at the same time. Our food also took forever to arrive, it almost seemed like they were giving priority to their takeout orders.

- Space: Do not come here for the ambience, there is none. The space is spartan and the service, like mentioned above fairly non existent. The advice to the owner is that perhaps they should invest in dedicated wait staff. 

I hope the owner can improve the dine-in experience, because the food is simply amazing."}
{"text":"Its a family run place with tasteful good food at good rates.. The dishes are freshly prepared and use authentic ingredients.
Yeah - the wait time is long - but anyone who knows anything about south asian cuisine - would appreciate that good taste and flavor does not come with quick preparation"}
{"text":"Great food that comes with superb service. The food was awesome everything we ordered was freshly prepared. The owners are really nice people and are doing a great job.
The food tends to take a while as everything is freshly prepared.
Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"My fiancé Ankur and I are pretty discerning about our Indian food, and we loved this place. He went to pick up the food we ordered, and came home talking about how he met the owner and what a great guy he was. He got the lamb kabob, I got the palak (trying to be vegetarian) and we shared the samosa chaat - everything was delicious. Will definitely come back. Check this place out! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Are they permanently closed ? Website keeps saying closed for renovations 
Hope to hear from the management .
Happy holidays"}
{"text":"Atrocious quality of food. When this place opened it looked like a place that would serve authentic Hyderabadi dishes at a reasonable price. The quality of the food steadily came down to a point where their food tastes very stale and has ZERO flavor. Looks like the owners of this place threw in the towel and are pretty much out to get whatever they can before they eventually shut down this place. 

The attitude of the people that work at this place isn't very helpful either when it comes to addressing customer complaints about the quality of the food that's served. Won't be going back to this place EVER."}
{"text":"This is authentic hyderabadi cuisine. I had the Nihari which was delightfully aromatic and tender and the kabobs were succulent. I'm tired of dried out over cooked kabobs so really great that they got it right. 

I've eaten at most of the local Indian places but this is really outstanding. Also found staff to be friendly and responsive.  Nice that it's right next to the movie theater. 

This is my new fav for kabobs in Charlotte. 

(Qualification: I am from India and am a kabob connoisseur hehe )"}
{"text":"My rating is zero.. please refer to my last rating and comments for the same restaurant and it was a 5*..Got to know that they have changed the chef and the new chef compromised quality over time.. the biriyani came quick but it was all shit..if Najma( pervious chef's name ) prepares the biriyani do come for sure but if it is the new chef, do keep safe distance.. the meat was smelly as well.. so if u care for your health just run away from this restaurant..one last thing- Najma will cook the biriyani if you give a to go order it seems( shared by the guy serving).. do check with the restaurant on the chef before coming here.."}
{"text":"The food is great but the wait time for the food even on a pick up order is unacceptable. The restaurant has great potential but as of right now I would have to say it's not there yet. I placed and order and had to wait an hour for it to be cooked.

I went to pick up the food after 45 minutes of waiting and the food was still not ready the man upfront told me it would be another 20 minutes of waiting. I decided to just cancel the order and took my money elsewhere. This behavior is beyond customer abuse. No sense of urgency and a total waste of customers time."}
{"text":"I did not finish this meal.
It was too good! I saved some to take home.
I had the Kadhai Chicken with Garlic Naan and rice and savored every bite. 
It's been difficult to find excellent dining experiences since moving to this side of town but Royal Biryani & Kabob is really good, and it's very affordably priced, too.

They have been open a month and it shows. It is almost a model in disorganization and confusion but the staff and owner are helpful friendly and accommodating as they get their sea legs in this endeavor.

The food is excellent enough to make up for any startup inconveniences!"}
{"text":"The Best Kabobs in town....Happy we have an amazing authentic kabob place in Charlotte Finally. The Biryani is delicious. A must try for everyone Hyderabad food lover."}
{"text":"Great food, clean place and very friendly! Even though they were very busy they made up for it by keeping us updated and bringing out fresh good food. Highly recommend!! Chicken tikka boti especially was superb - soft and juicy to the mark."}
{"text":"Good food, ordered goat briyani and chicken kabab, rice was kabab was good too.. gave suggestion to keep momos"}
{"text":"Very accommodating!  I wanted a vegetarian dish without dairy and the chef made me a delicious eggplant dish...big on flavor and light on oil as I requested.  He also made me Chapati which wasn't even on the menu.  Our family has omnivores, vegans and vegetarians so the only thing we agree on is flavorful And ethnic food."}
{"text":"Loved the place. Their chicken 65 was the bomb & a definite MUST. 
The owner and the workers were very polite and hospitable, and the customer service is +5 stars. do visit if you a food lover, they are new in business but way better than many Indian/ desi cuisines."}
{"text":"Great hidden gem by the movie theatre. On a whim went there and found some of the best Indian cuisine in Charlotte in quite awhile. The current owners have only been there 3 months but they are off to a a great start. This looks like a small family run business. Everyone was super friendly. The naan was made right;  thin and crispy and not like pita. The entrees are generous and well executed. Looking forward to many more trips there."}
{"text":"Great Indian food at a reasonable price. Who can beat that?  Went there for the first time today at lunch and was very impressed by the friendly staff, nice restaurant and amazing food. Check it out if you get the chance."}
{"text":"While the food was pretty good. (We prefer Tamarind) the service was soooo slow. It took 25 minute in between each course and non of the food came out together. My husband was done with his meal before I was even served. And I had to ask for rice (it's that a given when u get Indian?) The takeaway orders were given preferences over the dining room patrons.  Whats up with that??? In the end we spent 2 long hours there and won't be back."}
{"text":"Exceptional... hyderabad style.. food. Believe me all food lovers if you are in to and looking for some delicious hyderabad biryani, kebobs and naans..then you got to come and visit this place. Every resturant says that we serve hyderabad dum biryani.. but as soon as you eat you would say.. f**ck this right. Unlike them these guys really serve very good hyderabad biryani.."}
{"text":"Highest recommendation, unusual and outstanding food quality and is prepared perfectly. Its a perfect hyderabadi style biryani. Loved the platters."}
{"text":"Food is very good, if a bit expensive. Not many Indian options in Matthews so I was excited for something so close. Says they do dine in, but they're definitely not setup for it.  I received my food, then our appetizer came 5 minutes later, followed shortly by my wife's haleem and probably 10 minutes later my son's biriyani came out.  

No glasses, water is bottled and $1.20, which costs more than their canned soda offering. A pitcher of tap water would be fine, but wasn't offered. Something to keep in mind if you order something spicy... Mango lassy came in small styrofoam cup. 

Would probably order again for takeout, but the meals seemed lacking. Order a kebab and that's all you get, $10 for a couple chunks of meat. $14 haleem, same deal. No bread, no rice, no veg, everything is ordered separately. Kinda hard to make a meal without spending $20/pp ordering multiple things and $50-60 is a lot to spend on takeout."}
{"text":"Under new management. Fortunately the food arrives much faster.  Unfortunately the food is not even half as good as it was before."}
{"text":"On my first visit I called my order in and still had a 25 min wait once I arrived. I only stuck around because I was set on Indian food. Glad I waited because the mixed veggies and naan were great. 2nd visit, called it in and still had a 15 min wait. I ordered the same dish and it was nothing like what I had the first time. For the mixed veggies they used totally different vegetables which included broccoli and cauliflower, not good because they cooked it too long and the veggies turned mushy and the dish was much smaller. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"update: new owners, new menu, completely different cuisine in fact only the name remains https://www.royalbiryanius.com/
We badly need culinary variety in this neighborhood and I hope they figure things out soon. Hint: don't expect the dishes to be as described or depicted in the pictures."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the slowest restaurant in Matthews. Waited half an hour for my Goat Haleem. To make things even worse, the Goat Haleem sounds great on paper, what the menu description conveniently leaves out is that all ingredients are puréed together. It's like a tiny bowl of mushy meat and vegetables cereal! And way too expensive for the portion size."}
{"text":"The best Indian food in Charlotte. Such a nice vibe this restaurant has. Great friendly service, clean cozy interiors. The food is phenomenal. They obviously know what they are doing. Best samosa ever. Crispy, right out of the oil and the correct size. Not Those small ones you find in some other places. They have the ajwain seeds on the wrapper that make it taste like it's out of a sweet stall in India. Amazing! The bread is without a doubt best bread in Charlotte. Garlic naan and aloo paratha with that butter. Tasted like some bread I ate in Chandigarh a year ago. Kadai paneer made the right way as well. And to top it all the service was impeccable. They even gave me an extra mango lassi to go. The mango lassi was amazing as well. Can't wait for my next trip for more."}
{"text":"We popped into this little place near Crown Point Bistro theater thinking it would be mediocre at best.  Wow, were we ever surprised!  We shared the outstanding lamb biryani and bhindaloo goat (a few bones but lots of flavor) but the real surprise was the kashmiri naan.  Soft and warm naan with coconut and honey in the middle.  This is Northern Indian at its best, and you can get it spicy to taste on a scale from 1 -10.  The staff was kind and helpful, led by a delightful young host/waiter/son of the owner, who was most enthusiastic.  They've only been open for 4 months but we are definitely going back.  Their secret is that they do not skimp on spices (curry, saffron, etc.) - not just heat, but the flavorful spices that make the difference between standard buffet fare and truly good Indian food.  One of the best Indian restaurants we have found!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed both curries I got. The highlight though was khatmandu chicken! Finished up with masala chai which was delicious."}
{"text":"I had nice complete lunch specials including desert nan chicken masala for 9 and eggplant and potatoes for 8.  I would suggest it to anyone tasty and filling.  Well served. I would eat every week."}
{"text":"I popped in about a month ago. I am a big fan of Indian food and was anxious to try this place out. They are conveniently located near me and I'm very excited about that. I wish I could recall what I had. It was truly wonderful. The waitress was very helpful in helping me pick something out. I told her I was a vegetarian and she made several suggestions. It was very good and there was more than enough for leftovers. I have a feeling I will be stopping in quite frequently."}
{"text":"Very bad experience. Food quality was not up to mark as mentioned in the above reviews."}
{"text":"After noticing a new restaurant opening in the place of an old Favorite, I gave it a go.  I'm not new to Indian food but was happy to see a closer establishment in my area.  I got the butter chicken and plain naan before.  It was missing the rice and less chicken than expected.  The butter naan was good and fluffy.  Muy, the manager, was concerned about my review of my main dish and ask me to revisit days later.  My expectations were met this time and he also recommended more items to try next time.  He worked hard with his team to ensure my experience and other patrons won us as repetitive customers."}
{"text":"The food was amazingly good!! We had lamb seehk kabobs, kadhai goat and tandoori chicken and all three were made fresh to order.  The people were very nice and attentive.  We will be back for lunch today!"}
{"text":"Really great, fresh Indian food. They do not play with the spice level. I like spicy food but the level 7 spice got me sweating."}
{"text":"Stopped by today to get something to go for lunch. Ordered a staple, chicken tikka masala, and was underwhelmed. The sauce was bland and the chicken wasn't tender. To top it off, there is no lunch menu, so you'll be paying dinner (expensive) prices for a lunch-sized portion. No other items are included with the meal (except for rice). I was expecting at least one piece of naan. I eat at other Indian restaurants where lunch portions are adequate, well-flavored and include sides and naan for less than what I paid. Disappointed this wasn't a better experience since I live near this location and was hoping to visit regularly."}
{"text":"The restaurant has great food. My favorite was the kadhai goat. I would definitely recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"I wish I could leave a review less than 1 star! I was so excited to try this place. It was a terrible experience. Even the chai tea was awful. We waited for over an hour and a half, and when we finally got the food the beef Nihari tasted like a dirty sock that had been soaking in water. We finally just left, and got Chinese food next door."}
{"text":"Ordered again from Royal Biryani  through door dash and food was much tastier than it was for my last review. Quality was better as were the flavors. I understand there are new owners and the change is much welcomed."}
{"text":"My husband and I dined here last night first impression was it is a takeout joint with places to sit and eat if you wish to. We decided to eat in the waiter came and took our order and offered us a pitcher of water. I ordered the butter chicken which was fabulous and very tasty and my husband ordered the chicken Haleem which he said was delicious. Only problem was we didn't get any rice and these are gravy dishes and are in dire need of rice so I asked the waiter for some and he looked at me a little odd and said OK but the rice never came so I asked a different person for rice and eventually rice did show up. I checked the menu and it appears that rice is separate for a charge of $4.99 which in my mind is ridiculous. A fellow I believe is the owner came over to us and said they made a change in that rice  is now not extra but you still have to order it. We also ordered the garlic naan which was very good and had an appetizer of the vegetable Samosa which was good if not a little dry and spicy. I ordered a cup of chai tea which took a while to get that was very good. All in all I would say the food here is excellent but they are disorganized which I am sure they will work out with time as they said they had only been open for 30 days. On a sidenote I just ate my leftovers for lunch and they were just as good as it was last night. We highly recommend this restaurant for very good authentic Indian food."}
{"text":"I couldn't think of one reason to give this place a 4!  Great price for portion and the most authentic and tasty Indian food I've had in Charlotte. Small place but clean and welcoming decor. Owners quite friendly. Hope this one stays around."}
{"text":"This was a great place. Naan was some of the best, I think because it is freshly made, as with all there food! Couldn't ask for better customer service from owner and staff taking the time to explain the menu and Indian food! Great experience!"}
{"text":"Royal Biryani and Kabob is delicious and don't be afraid to order a lot because it makes for superb leftovers. However, they are painfully slooooooow. We spent about 2.5 hrs. in the restaurant and we've got two kids under the age of three, so, that sort of time frame doesn't work well for us. The food is incredibly fresh, authentic, and clearly made from scratch. I would be thrilled to eat Royal's food again (and again), however, I'm putting them in the take-out category from now on. Order your food about an hour before you intend to pick it up. 

Of note, the interior is very clean and staff are friendly and clearly care about the quality of the food. It has the feel of a family-run restaurant, in a good way."}
{"text":"I've been to many authentic food stops and this one is just unbelievably good. This is the best place to get great Indian food at affordable prices! The selection of curry that you can get is extensive and holds a lot of variety. From spicy and runny to thick and creamy, their curry is to die for. The samosa is really good and flaky. Staff is very friendly and helpful. This place deserves more business because it's the best Indian food around."}
{"text":"With our kitchen being out, I have the chance to visit places that we normally do not visit.

Royal Biryani was quite pleasant, we ordered take out and the dishes were explained to me by my boss from northern India.  His descriptions we dead on for what I was expecting and made me think that this is quite traditional.  Very delicious, I want to get what ever that thin rice is for home!

I reheated a paneer kabob the next day and was again so pleased and I will get some extra 'white' sauce (forgot the name) next time.

I thought it was funny in talking to my boss, when we got to the desserts, he thought the fired banana was not traditional.

Thanks for a great meal+
Will be back."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! I got the butter chicken, chicken 65, chicken biriyani, and naan. We are visiting from New York and can say this has been one of the best restaurants for Indian food. I recommend it."}
{"text":"Came based on word of mouth from friends and presently surprised. Traditionally have not been a fan of Indian food but it's been growing on me with the opening of Tandur. With that being said, this was better and significantly more satisfying. I would suggest the Samosa Chat as an appetizer (like regular samosas but waaaay better). I tried the Shahi Korma and it was amazing! Creamy but also with warming spices. Haven't figured out quite my right spice level (1-10) but will be coming back to find out!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious and service was Awesome. Never had this kind of cuisine across charlotte area. We ordered Kabab platters and Goat Biryani!! It was just Awesome . Meat was so tender and delicious even though you are full one will keep eating. It is just amazing!! Great to have RKB in charlotte area. Thank you guys."}
{"text":"Stopped into the the recently renovated Royal Biryani restaurant this evening. Mercy goodness finally a legit, great Indian restaurant in the area. 

Sadly I was the only one there so not sure how many people know about the place but without a doubt I'll be back. Had a traditional curry with chicken (if ya can't do a traditional curry right then what's the point being open) and it was spot on. 

Located corner of Sardis North & Monroe (in the shops by the movie theater). Just thought I'd share. Would like to see this place stick around. The owner is a gem. 

Just my two cents."}
{"text":"While the food on the other tables looked good, my experience was different. 45 minutes in an empty restaurant to get a lamb kabab. While the meat was well seasoned, it was very over cooked and required a dipping sauce (ordered extra) to get it down. The naan, when it eventually arrived half way through the meal, was tasty. 

If it wasn't for the poor service, slow delivery, modest portions, bad cooking and over inflated prices, it could be a nice place. I hope I just had a rare bad experience. But from now on I'll just to back to Pita Kabab Grill."}
{"text":"We really like Indian food, but haven't found a go to place for us. We came here honestly because we went to a movie next door.
My wife loves biryani, and wanted to try it.
The food came out perfect and hot, with generous portions.
We really have another meal at home from or two entrees.
As well the black dal was good, and the rasmalai was great as well. The owner is very friendly and he is the cook as well."}
{"text":"Always refreshing to have food with spice and flavor in the Matthews area. Great personable ownership and quality authentic food."}
{"text":"Food and customer service is excellent at this restaurant. Finally we have an authentic Indian/Pakistani restaurant.  The food is mouth watering delicious. Food is freshly made when you order.  The kabobs are succulent and if you try the roll wrapped in paratha it is just yummy. I ordered 3 items to go. Food was fresh and made to order. I would definitely recommend this restaurant."}
