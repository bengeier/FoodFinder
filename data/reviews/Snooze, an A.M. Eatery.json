{"text":"This is my local breakfast spot. My daughter and I come here at least once per week. All the waitresses know us and our order. They come by and say hi to her and play games with her. The food is consistently good. If you want a great mimosa or to try something a bit different a brewmosa."}
{"text":"Delicious pineapple upside down pancakes, delicious corned beef and hash. Went to the one in San Diego, in Scottsdale and at the train station in Denver and wasn't disappointed. Wish they'd open in the East Bay.  San Ramon needs a brunch spot!"}
{"text":"Ate on the patio as we had our dog with us, which was nice. Our server was very attentive. The food was not that good. Ok it was awful. The pretzel bun on my breakfast sandwich was very greasy and the hash browns were so salty they were almost inedible. They also tasted like a nasty cigar. My girlfriend's Beat (?) sandwich had way too much aioli sauce on it and the aioli tasted like bad body odor. I'm not a picky eater and I literally had a hard time swallowing the bite I took. Almost made me puke. Even our house coffees weren't good, tasted burnt. How do you mess up hash browns? We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Such a cute trendy brunch place. I had the Bangkok Bloody Mary and my friend had the Cosmonaut. Both were good drinks. The Breakfast Pot Pie with sunny side up eggs was amazing! The crust is flaky and breaks off to perfection. My friend had the Bella Bella Benny, (one of the eggs benedict versions) with prosciutto and perfectly poached eggs and arugula. We also tried the Flight of Pancakes, with the chocolate chip, cinnamon swirl and upside down pineapple.  Everything was delish!"}
{"text":"Chris was a fantastic server and this is an absolutely amazing place for breakfast. First review but been to all of the locations in the valley and tried at least half of the menu (favorites are omg French toast and breakfast tacos) You can't go wrong with anything here, just make sure to get here early to avoid a long wait."}
{"text":"We love Snooze! Try their gluten free pancakes! Amazing service. Amazing menu. Amazing experience every time."}
{"text":"This is an awesome brunch spot! Great take on traditional breakfast fare. Fun relaxing atmosphere with great service. Just opening in Houston, my home town. Can't wait to visit the newest Snooze!"}
{"text":"BEST BREAKFAST EVER!

Snooze is hands down the best breakfast I have ever had. Me and my family came here when we got in town last week. and I had to make sure I reviewed this place. Amazing pancakes, the cinnamon glaze is RIDICULOUS. Great service too!
Will come again!

{"text":"Oh my gosh, where do I start. The service is amazing and I have never waited a very long time to be seated, even when they are busy. Coffee is great and they always refill in a timely manner. Waitresses are all nice and upbeat. I always, always, always get the breakfast tacos. I am addicted to them. They are so yummy and have a ton of stuff on them! Love this place!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a good breakfast restaurant and we found it. The wait staff was friendly and efficient, the food was excellent and moderately priced and the atmosphere was bright and cheerful. I had the corn beef hash with eggs and it was as good as it gets - real chunks of corned beef saut√©ed with onions, poblano peppers and grated potatoes. My wife, brother and sister-in-law each had something different and though I wasn't paying attention to what they ordered, their plates were clean when we finished. 

Definitely worth a visit or two or three."}
{"text":"Awesome find! Great local favorite.
Peter Paul Reubens excellent and chocolate molten lava pancake worth a splurge.
Melanie our server was delightful and so very patient with us.
We'll be back."}
{"text":"I want to say the food was delicious the first time when I came few months ago , but today I have very bad experience I brought my family and we were waiting for 1.15min,  Asian  girl who is taking an order she said will be between 35 to 45 minutes and she was very disrespectful and very rude and I'm thinking a management should be aware of that, when we got call in from the waitress the tables is ready, She stopped us and said no that's not for you , your table not ready you have to wait another 25 minutes after when we we're waiting for 1.15 . We got very upset and we left."}
{"text":"I had a very disappointing experience yesterday (22 Nov) at the N Scottsdale location eating at the bar. The barista/waitress was rude, and the service was bad. The sad thing is I am a frequent customer.

She never once came back to check whether everything was ok or whether I needed more hot water for the tea. It took me awhile to get her attention to ask for honey for my tea. When she did bring me the honey, she gave me an almost empty bottle, and I couldn't get one drop of honey out of the bottle.  

She was more attentative to other customers and checked back with the guy sitting next to me at least twice to see how everything was but ignored me even when I was trying to get her attention.

The only thing she said to me was \"Are you done?\" towards the end while I was still finishing the toast!!!

The food is delicious but you guys really need to work on your services and attitudes of your servers!"}
{"text":"This is a GEM of a place...even on a Saturday morning with a 40 minute wait. So worth it.
A modern twist on some classic dishes, breakfast elevated and improved. .....not just the most important meal of the day......now the best meal of the day.
I had Benny Goodman...this has to be experienced to truly appreciate the flavors all working in harmony atop a perfect poaced egg.
Star of the meal....Bluberry Streusel Pancake for desert. This was great BEFORE being surprised by the lemon cream cheese filling!
The hospitality....outstanding. The service...Austin...remembers me from last time....not my server this time out but took the time to say hi while we were waiting. Great waiter and super nice person....made me feel special.
Well done Snooze...my favorite breakfast place"}
{"text":"Overall, I thought this place was a little overrated. I would rather give it 3.5 stars but didn't think it quite deserved 4 stars. The service was mediocre. They seemed more interested in hanging out with each other. We got the pancake flight (sweet potato, pineapple upside down, and blueberry danish). These were all tasty and very unique but dry! I wish they gave you extra sauce. My husband got the eggs Benedict, the balsamic one and verde one. My husband said they were good. Then our daughter had the French toast kids meal. I had to remind them to bring us the drink for it. Overall, I'm glad I went and it was fun to have a breakfast you can't really get anywhere else. But the few things mentioned above makes me not eager to go back."}
{"text":"Very good food. Wait was 30 minutes, but worth it. Sweet potato pancake was something magical."}
{"text":"Bella Bella Benny was absolutely amazing! My new favorite eggs benedict. Got the 1/2 and 1/2 so my other benedict was the pork with the chili verde hollandaise. That one was quite underwhelming. 
Cute decor, really, really noisy, which was a bummer. Made having a conversation hard. That is the only reason the review is 4 stars, the noise. 
Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Last Saturday I had my first experience at Snooze and let me say, it was one of the best restaurant experiences I have ever had!! I stopped in with my mom about 11:00am and the wait was 30-45 minutes but we were able to walk around the mall because they sent us a text message when our table was ready. We were sat by a very sweet hostess and our server Jenna came to our table quickly with a contagious smile and friendly attitude! We needed some suggestions on the menu since there were many options and we were new customers. After reviewing the menu and answering all of the questions we had, Jenna suggested a few of her favorites and we ended up with a caprese benedict, a verde benedict and the breakfast pot pie. As we waited for our food, a pancake was brought out to us \"on the house\". WOW!!! Our meal ended up being one of the best breakfasts we've had in awhile. A manager even stopped by to see how we were doing and that is quite unheard of in restaurants. The staff at Snooze were some of the nicest people we've ever encountered and seemed to genuinely care about their customers! Not only was our food fantastic, but our experience with Jenna as our server will definitely make us return to Snooze Kierland! You can't beat great breakfast foods with even better service! Thanks Snooze and Jenna for making our first visit memorable!"}
{"text":"I/we have eaten at the Kierland location several times, this restaurant does a good job, most of the time. Excellent service..."}
{"text":"I am so happy with my brunch today. Finally feel like i can be a regular here. Being a vegetarian its so hard to enjoy food at restaurants specially when u r a foodie.
Loved the soyrizo it was so yummy
My fav place for sure :)"}
{"text":"I expected a lot from this restaurant since I heard a lot good feedback from my co-workers. I am not sure if its the food I ordered that I didn't like. For me, there's nothing special? They offer the usual breakfast.

Though, the location are pretty nice, and tge interiors too."}
{"text":"We had breakfast here this morning and it was packed as usual for a weekend morning. Thankfully, we were willing to sit outside, so the wait time wasn't bad. Chris greeted us fairly promptly after we were sat. We had several special requests with our order and our food came our perfectly. Chris kept our coffee and waters full and was very friendly even though he was crazy busy. We also got to visit with Hannah as she has been our server a few times previously. Nice of her to check on us. The pancake of the day was bacon themed and it was fabulous. We will be back again."}
{"text":"We don't dine out for breakfast food much but this place has me craving breakfast food all day!  I haven't ventured pasted the breakfast tacos (scrambled eggs, hash browns, green onion, pico, cheese, green chile hollandaise and I add avocado).  I don't normally like hollandaise but this one is amazing.  I tried a bite of the \"Sandwich I Am\" and the pretzel roll was delish.  I also tried a piece of chocolate chip pancake and it was amazing.  They do have healthy options as well I just haven't bothered with them.  I love that you can get a cocktail so next time I'll have to come back on a weekend.  

I would definitely recommend this place for the great food, cleanliness and friendly service.  Both times I've been here the entire staff was friendly and they all seem to work together to meet customers needs."}
{"text":"Amazing, delicious, and nutrious food! Plus very environmentally friendly restaurant with only 15% of waste going to the landfill!"}
{"text":"This place has quickly become my favorite breakfast restaurant. Their menu is intimidating at first, but the servers are more than happy to break it down. Don't worry though, you can't go wrong with any of the options.
Ask me how I know!
They have a bar and the patio is really nice, it's a great place to come and eat. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This review is based solely on service, the food was delicious. 

We arrived and were told that there was a 20 minute wait, no problem. We got a text that our table was ready after 10 minutes, fantastic as we had a 2 year old and newborn with us. We went inside to let the hostess know we were there and she said pointed out a gentleman that she said would seat another couple before us and then take us to our seats, again, no problem. Things go downhill from here. He comes back and takes another couple to their seats and then doesn't acknowledge us for another 2 minutes while he chats with the hostess about how busy the place is. All the while we are standing in the cramped entry way with 2 kids and people everywhere, we were in the way and couldn't do anything about it. 

We were taken to our seat which was a crowded booth in the back. Our server didn't come over for about 4-5 minutes, took our drink order and then we waited for quite some time to get our coffee and juice. She set the drinks down, asked if we were ready to order, in which we said yes, and she said ok, I have to go greet another table so I'll be right back. We watched her greet the table, take what I assume was a drink order and then went to another table of 6 to take their food order. She finally came back, we placed our order along with another drink and proceeded to wait until our food came out to get the other drink. When we asked about the long wait for food and drinks she said she waited to put our order in until after a \"very large party\"...what?? We only asked because the 2 tables next to us were seated after us and we're finishing their meals as ours were arriving.

Hoping this is just a one-off and not typical service but I'll think twice before going back."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times and every time this place is packed. Which is great for them and horrible for us. You are guaranteed a wait time. The last time I was there I asked for a table for 2. Now just like any restaurant if there is a wait they will take your name and call you. But this time the lady said they're full but take a seat at the bar and grab a seat when available. So we did just that. Then while seated 3 waiters and a manager asked what we were doing there. The manager had us go up to the greeter. She then said in front of the manager they would have taken my name. Well, she didn't. She was denying everything in front of that manager. We left. 
So in short, the food isn't really worth the wait especially if they hire that kind of help."}
{"text":"Great fun energetic vibe and decor, great quality food and if you love Eggs Benedict, you'll love this place so delish!"}
{"text":"Do not order the sweet potato hash thinking it will be like hashbrows made from sweet potatoes.  To my dismay it was chunks of half cooked sweet potatoes with a bunch of crap in it. #Totally disappointed"}
{"text":"Great service! Great food! Waiter was wonderful and very outgoing and also purchased us a item on menu for everyone to try! Prices are very reasonable! I would definitely suggest anyone in the area to try this place!"}
{"text":"Weekend brunch. This is the place to go. The food is beyond! Definitely worth the wait. It's a popular spot, and for good reason! Bravo to the chef. Everything I've tasted was perfection. And the little spins on a classic mimosa is the cherry on top. Saturday can't get here soon enough!"}
{"text":"Unbelievably delicious breakfast! We enjoyed the Sandwich I Am, the Cinnamon Roll pancake topped with bacon, and the Snooze Spuds Deluxe. All of them were fantastic. Our server was wonderful. My only critique would be how loud it was in the restaurant. The person cleaning the silverware was right next to our table. We went in on a Saturday afternoon and we were pleasantly surprised with how fast it was. We were sat right away and our food was out in 10 minutes. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place! It's always a long wait but it's because the food is so good. I love the berry flight of pancakes and it doesn't get much better than their savory egg Benedict options."}
{"text":"Great place to make breakfast extraordinary!
Creative take on your breakfast favorites that make you wanting more. 

Be expect to wait some but worth the wait."}
{"text":"If you're tired of the same old breakfast and same old breakfast place then try this place. We've always had a great breakfast and the different items you can choose from are outstanding. They have your basic breakfast items and then they have those same items with a twist. The kids menu is also excellent. If you want something different, check it out."}
{"text":"When we arrived, we checked in and gave our cell phone number. We were told the wait was 5-15 minutes. That message repeated on my cell phone, but we were never told that a table was ready even though many people were leaving. When we went back to the desk, suddenly we were able to be seated. Then we waited again for a waitress to even ask if we wanted something to drink. When she arrived and we ordered decaf coffee, she left, only to come back after some more time to tell us that a new pot had to be brewed. We waited even longer for the coffee. Meantime, the waitress did take our food order, including crispy hash browns. 
Finally the coffee arrived with some cream, but was definitely not a tasty coffee. 

After a much longer wait (the restaurant was NOT full at this point), the eggs benedict with crispy hash browns did arrive for me, and the pancakes with blueberry sauce and a lemony mascarpone cheese filling arrived for my husband. We were not offered, or asked if we wanted, ketchup for the hash browns or syrup for the pancakes. The hash browns were cooked as we liked them and the poached eggs were done just right and the belly ham was tasty, but the Hollandaise sauce was very bland (Knorr package sauce is better!). My own hash browns are tastier. 

The pancakes tasted of flour but not much else; the mascarpone filling was only in the very center, so you didn't really taste it until you were halfway through eating the pancakes. The blueberry sauce on top was way too sweet and hardly tasted of blueberries. 

We were asked if we wanted more coffee once; at the very end of the meal, I was asked if I wanted additional coffee, but my husband was not even asked.

We don't go out for breakfast often, and my husband needs to be coaxed to do so, but this place was recommended by some friends, so we decided to try it out. What a disappointment! It may take me even longer to coax my husband to try out another breakfast place. Other than the convenient location of Snooze restaurant in Kierland with a nice outdoor patio, I would definitely not go back to this restaurant; neither the food nor the service will bring us back!"}
{"text":"I didn't have to be at work till after 12 so I went for a solo brunch on a weekday around 10. It was busier than I thought and took 10 or so minutes for me to get seated, which was out on the patio. 
Unfortunately, I had to wait 5-10 minutes before anyone even came by to ask if I wanted coffee. 

I got the snooze combo and subbed out the toast for a blueberry pancake (extra $3.50). The eggs were alright, the hash browns pretty good, but the sausage was pretty horrible. It wasn't very warm and was pretty hard. Probably should have gone with bacon or chorizo but ¬Ø\_(?)_/¬Ø 
The pancake, however, was awesome. In the unlikely event I return, I'd probably just get pancakes and avoid the other stuff."}
{"text":"First time in, and we will be back again. Had the burrito, and wow! The service was great, the selection was better and the food was amazing! Fresh!"}
{"text":"My wife had a week of training in North Scottsdale and asked if I would like to tag along. Having family in the area, I was excited to join her. Our hotel did not serve a complimentary breakfast and I am so thankful. We would have missed this amazing breakfast joint if they did. Snooze has a fantastic variety of options for breakfast. We ate there Monday through Sunday morning and had the opportunity to explore many of the items on the menu. EVERYTHING was wonderful and fresh. The sweet potato pancakes and pineapple upside down pancakes are sinful. The caprese benedict was delightful in the summer with the fresh heirloom tomatoes. The Benny Goodman is a must if you love lax style salmon. The breakfast tacos are light but filling. I added avocado to my order, but the portion size of avocado didn't seem worth it. The gents at the bar are fantastic hosts as were the other staff members. *insider secret* hash browns are typically served after being cooked in a tall ring mold. Delish, but not the crispness I usually enjoy for my potatoes.  If you like your hash browns crispy, just ask for them flat and crispy."}
{"text":"Special to YELP
I am a Trip Advisor person, but the establishment relies on YELP for feedback, so I am making a dual review.

Title: Don't Snooze

I don't know what it is like at 6:30, but when we arrived a little after 9 on a Saturday the place was jammed and we were told there was a 20 minute wait.  It ended up being shorter than that as we were a party of 2, larger groups of course are harder to seat, so if you don't want to wait, don't snooze

We had their brother/sister pair.  Their specialty is the Spuds Supreme, a mountain of their delicious hash browns, topped with 2 choices of filling, melted cheese, scallions and two eggs cooked to order.  My wife had the Sweet Potato Hash, with chicken and sauce.  Both were more than ample and scrumptious.  I am not a coffee connoisseur but found the coffee to be excellent, not too strong but with excellent flavor, mellow would best describe it.

Service was some of the best I've seen even in 4 star restaurants.  Our server Lila was efficient, yet easy going and very congenial, Another plus is that management is actively working the floor to keep a pulse on operations.  One of our coffee refills was by Daren, who by all appearances could not be differentiated from any of the other servers, but after a brief conversation as to how he got here said he was one of the 3 managers of the operation.  This is a great as any concerns can be dealt with quickly as the management can see a problem developing themselves.  Kudos to a great upscale breakfast/lunch place with local hash shop feel."}
{"text":"Loved the Bloody Mary and Breakfast Burrito! Staff was just as good as the food even with how slammed they always are."}
{"text":"Positively delicious!! Had the pretzel bread scrambled egg sandwich -- so so tasty! Fast service, fresh food-- just yum!"}
{"text":"Chris is the best!  Had the hash and the lower eat sider - couldn't.pass up the bloody Mary's, too!  Thanks for a great morning!"}
{"text":"Kudos to the front desk staff for their excellent handling of the crowd.  We were told it was a 20 minute wait, but were actually seated after about 5 minutes on a busy Sunday morning.  After reading all the reviews I expected something very special in the way of food. I had the Benny Duo - one Ham Benedict III and a Chile Verde Benny with \"crisp\" house has browns.  My husband had a breakfast  burrito with verde sauce.  The classic Ham Benedict was a 2 on a 5 - the egg was perfectly poached, but the sauce which really makes the dish outstanding tasted watery.  The Chile Verde Benny was ok but the pulled pork was cold which was quite unexpected in a hot egg based dish.  I was given a choice of regular or crisp hash browns and choose the crisp - thankfully.  It seemed that thawed hash browns had been put on a griddle with oil to cook the outside but the inside was just warmed up grated potato.  The burrito was nothing special - the verde sauce  tasted like Safeway special from a jar. 

Snooze seems \"the\" place to be for weekend breakfast, but I'm left wondering why.  Doubt if we'll be back to try anything else."}
{"text":"What an amazing breakfast. Loved it. Food is excellent. Server was friendly, knowledgeable and attentive. The freshness is apparent in the food."}
{"text":"Food was fine, service below average, Wait time/seating process -RIDICULOUS. Not because they were busy, but because they hold tables open/empty for 10 minutes while the guests shop. Then if they don't show up, they go to the next name on the list who could also take 10 minutes to show up.  This process results in empty tables and potential customers waiting around getting more frustrated by the minute. We waited but I counted at least 20 people get fed up and leave. 
Excellent location for a breakfast place. Sad to see lack of customer focus."}
{"text":"First time here couple days ago took a family member out for a birthday brunch, waited about 25 min on a Sunday. Everything was so delicious, got the corn beef hash with eggs. Very nice vibe, atmosphere and very friendly waiters will be back again"}
{"text":"Today I went to Snooze with my bosses visiting from Pennsylvania. I was told previously that new customers get a complimentary pancake and have seen this many times, especially in Colorado and at this location. The new server had to come back and tell us that can't be done if it's specifically asked for. That is crazy sounding. He told us red faced (his first day) and not his manager. It was a rude and uncomfortable for the new server and our table. Very snotty and not the laid back Colorado vibe I've come to expect. The food was great as was the the server! Please don't go all snotty!"}
{"text":"This breakfast place is wonderful and delicious. I had the classic breakfast and my friend had French toast. The service is excellent and attentive. The only downside to this place is the noise level, it is loud in there."}
{"text":"Had the most enjoyable time at snooze second day in a row ,great food great service a bit of a line but well worth it. Best poached eggs in forever !"}
{"text":"Had a fantastic breakfast here while in vacation. Our waitress was very friendly and helpful naming her top 5 recommendations. We had the breakfast pot pie, very indulgent but delicious, the corned beef hash and a pineapple pancake! I would recommend them all! Great place!"}
{"text":"Snooze is amazing! From the atmosphere to the delicious food, this is definitely one of the best breakfast restaurants in Scottsdale. The service is also wonderful! Our server Jenna was so friendly, helpful and funny! She had a smile on her face the entire time and made sure our food was absolutely perfect! We weren't sure what to order since it was our first time there, but she went over the menu with us and helped us each decide on what to get... it's obvious that she knows the menu from front to back!

We will definitely spread the word! Thanks, Jenna!"}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast food, even better service. Everyone treated us great. Spicy bloody marry is on point!"}
{"text":"Amazing Breakfast!!!! My family and I are visiting from California and saw great reviews for this place and decided to try it out! We had great meals! We left very satisfied and not overly full! The food was fresh and the mimosas were great! The menu if full of many different options! We are in Scottsdale for 10 days and decided we will eat breakfast here almost everyday!"}
{"text":"Came in for my first AZ Snooze experience, Sep 6 2015.  I was so excited for Snooze to open in Scottsdale.  After the first time I experienced Snooze in Denver a few years ago, I could not wait to try the pineapple upside down pancakes again.   Scottsdale Snooze was a great disappointment.   The Pineapple Upside Down Pancakes in Denver were just that, butter, pineapple ring and brown sugar on the bottom of the pancakes so it was somewhat caramelized and reminded you of Mom's special Pineapple Upside Down Cake.  It was absolutely the best!   

The same item on Scottsdale menu was so very disappointing.    It was a plain pancake with canned pineapple tidbits sprinkled on top and a small dollop of brown sugar on the side.   This did not even resemble the taste or experience of Denver.   I inquired as to the difference and our waiter said he thought each location was similar.   Well, the taste was not the same, the ingredients were not the same and the experience was not the same.   

Extremely disappointing.    I had even told the waiter I had been to the Denver location and was looking forward to trying this pancake again.   If the waiter had informed me the pancakes were not the same I would have ordered something different; perhaps the waitstaff at this location has never experienced the original restaurant, perhaps the restaurants are under different ownership or maybe they are just trying to keep costs down.  Whatever the reason, this was very disappointing.  

I inquired as to whether they had apple juice and was not informed before bringing it to the table that it was more of a cider, not what I expected.   It was not that great and again had I been told it was a cider I would have ordered a different beverage.   It may have been listed as cider on the menu; however I knew what I wanted when I went in, so did not bother to look at menu."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible experience. We were excited to try this new breakfast spot, and we didn't mind the 60+ minute wait. The problems started when they took our name off the wait list (before we were seated), causing the wait to be much longer. No apology. The food was mediocre- particularly the congealed gravy on the breakfast pot pie. Our drinks were never refilled, no manager ever touched our table. Terrible service and food. We will not be returning. Thanks for ruining our Valentine's Day brunch."}
{"text":"Food is very good but the service has gotten consistently worse over the last year or so. I suggest the corned beef hash or eggs Benedict. Their pancakes are also good but they tend to put too many toppings on them."}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast place in town!

I have now eaten there twice and its is my favorite go to place for amazing breakfast and lunch. The OMG French toast is amazing and decadent!  They added the Caprese Eggs Benedict to their summer menu and it was the best I've ever had. My husband had the grilled ham and cheese and also said it was the best he's ever had!  Keep up the amazing work Snoozers!  I am a loyal customer!  The wait is worth it and the service is excellent!"}
{"text":"My mom and I had breakfast here recently and loved it! Wonderful (filling but not too greasy) breakfast. The food was fresh and delicious, server was great and atmosphere cute and trendy. Definitely a place I would visit again!"}
{"text":"We stayed a few days in Scottsdale and I found this place on yelp. I tried the pineapple upside down pancakes (even though it was a very tough choice!) but it was definitely a very good choice. I had to make myself stop eating them. I was so full but they were soooo good!!! We took the leftovers and had them the next day. Weren't as good as in the restaurant but we're still pretty darn good! My husband had the burrito and said it was pretty good too. I wish that we had more time so that we could go back and explore more of the menu. The coffee was also very good. Our waitress was very energetic and friendly. She gave us several suggestions and checked back with us often. But not annoyingly so. All in all it was a great choice and we will definitely be back when we return to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Amazing as is every single Snooze! Been to Del Mar, Camelback & now Scottsdale. Best pancakes!!! Always looking to go there!"}
{"text":"Good food, good service, good ambiance.  Had the french toast, my wife had a three egg breakfast.  We did not leave hungry."}
{"text":"After eating at Snooze several times in the past and then again today, I've decided it's not worth the ever present wait.  Not only is it expensive, today my eggs were cold, the bacon was burned and our waiter (or the kitchen) forgot our pancake.  The pineapple upside down pancake was amazing, however not good enough to offset the fact that I had to ask for more coffee after sitting empty for 10 minutes.  Will not be back."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot! Try already one of there pancakes, it will be well worth it. I ate the corn beef hash a long with the breakfast tacos. We were not disappointed. Anything you order will be well above average. Love the vibe as well."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant the food was gr8 and lots of it!! Hanna was the most delightful and helpful server. She made the experience perfect! She definitely loves what she does and it shows. I had the spicy Bloody Mary and breakfast burrito. They also brought me a birthday pancake to celebrate."}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast spots. The traditional breakfast is consistently amazing. Always great food and always great customer service."}
{"text":"Tho crowded and busy, we received great service and the food was well presented and delicious.  Sundays are always busy."}
{"text":"Good food and good atmosphere. Service can be spotty because of crowds. Often a long wait. The Huevos and tacos are fairly bland IMO. They have a lot of over the top dishes-- super sweet pancakes a and French toast and some decadent egg dishes.  The standards --egg breakfast, regular pancakes and French toast are strong and consistently prepared well. Big menu with a lot of options. Best of all-- they have real hash browns which is a must for us. A very solid breakfast option."}
{"text":"I went to Snooze for the first time last week with some friends.  I haven't stopped thinking about it since! The place is nice and cheery with a lovely upbeat atmosphere.  The table ordered one of the pancakes on special to share. It was AMAZING.  Everything we ordered was perfection.  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast place in Scottsdale!  Everything was fresh and amazing!  I had the breakfast tacos....outstanding!  Get there early!  They were on an hour wait at 9:30am.  Well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I have been to one of their locations in Denver a few times, so I was really excited that they opened a new location here. The variety of choices (not just pancakes!) is impressive, especially all the Benedict plates.

The Chilaquiles Benedict or the Corned Beef Hash are my two recommendations!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in town. Although the wait time can be anywhere from an hour or more, the food is well worth the wait. Their signature sweet potato pancakes are out of this world so I highly recommend you try them. I'm not a vegetarian but their soyrizo is very flavorful as well. I love this place because of its consistency so I'm never disappointed when I keep coming back for more!"}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would. The hostess was so rude. There were many tables (easily 10) open, a long line of people outside, and a 45 minute wait. The hostess was \"holding\" tables for people however not servicing the people actual there. I have been to this restaurant in Denver and unfortunately will never go again."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast on nonbusy mornings (I avoid weekends there).   I had the corn beef hash this morning which is why I am writing this review- it was great!  Love the ambiance, staff and food with a couple provisos : the interior is super noisy so conversations can be a bit difficult and I typically always have to ask for a coffee refill . . . someone should be walking the floor with a coffee pot regularly"}
{"text":"Snooze is Extraordinary!
I ordered the make your own egg white omelet (I put in Spinach, Caramelized onion and feta cheese) with a cup of hot chai tea. It was one of the best breakfasts I have ever had in my life!! The taste and textures were amazing!!!!
I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Perfection!  Eggs Benny, Breakfast Burrito, Pancakes - oh my, how to decide.  Leeah took very good care of us, thank you!  We tired it all........heaven.  Yeah, it can be super busy -- just chill and settle in.  Worth it."}
{"text":"Snooze is hands down one of the best dining experiences I have ever had. Many places use the term \"cage free\" to upsell  their items. Not Snooze. In addition, our server Ash, was amazing. She even sent over a sample of one of their pancakes, since I ordered the other of her favorite pancakes. My wife had the breakfast pot pie, and the puff pastry was beyond flakey. I had the Benny duo (since they will let you combine different eggs Benedict at no additional charge.) I ordered the chili verde and the chilaquile Benedicts. They were beyond delicious, and served atop several corn tortillas. Snooze is the perfect dining option when it comes to flavor, budget and delicious coffee."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Been here twice now and both times food and service was great! Our waiter very friendly and entertaining and can't go wrong with any of the food! Had their pancake flight and all the pancakes are to die for! Probably some of the best pancake flavors I've ever  had!! Definitely a place I will keep going back to!"}
{"text":"I love this place!! It was my sister and my first time here on Friday and we couldn't be happier with it. Our server Jesse was amazing and by observing we could tell the rest of the staff was genuine and great as well. We ate the half orders of caprese Benedict and the original Benedict with one blueberry danish lemon pancake. We also had the spuds deluxe with the must amazing bacon you'll ever have! Along with their sweet potato pancake. Super impressed with this place and will be back very shortly! It was everything we wanted it to be."}
{"text":"My son and I kept the Election Day tradition going yesterday of waiting for the Polls to open, vote, breakfast and then off to work. 
Walked in the unlocked doors at 6:28 AM and after a brief discussion of us being early amongst two staff members we were told that we could sit wherever we wanted. SCORE! 
I ordered the traditional Ham Benedict III with well done hash browns. My son ordered the Pancake Flight of Blueberry Danish, Sweet Potato and Pinapple Upside Down. 
A few minutes later our food was served.  I had mixed reactions when looking at the two plates:
1. I won...healthy serving of well done hash browns instead of the usual flattened hockey puck. Everything was beautifully  plated... just like on TV!  They were by far the best that I have had from any Snooze here in AZ as they were delicious.
 2. My son lost...three different styled pancakes looking a bit lonely and a bit embarrassed as they were all pretty small on such a big plate. They charge $9 + for those? Really? Had no idea that the cost of pancake batter was SO expensive! He said that they were OK.
Service was prompt.  We were in a hurry so we ate, paid and left.
On the way out we both saw a plated pancake flight at another table and they all were  \"pancakes on steriods\" in size. Once outside we looked at each other and started laughing hysterically. We decided that since he was the first one to step inside 2 minutes early he had been punished. 
Thank you for the amusing breakfast. We will be back but only after 6:30 and no pancakes."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious egg white frittata.  Service was awesome even though it was packed.  Highly recommend this place.  The couple next to us had the pancake sampler which looked amazing."}
{"text":"We heard from someone at the pool at our complex that this was a good place for breakfast!  Wow!!  It was the best!!  Be sure to order the pineapple pancakes....yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Solid choice for breakfast when in Scottsdale. Easy parking, friendly staff and decent options for vegans/veggies. I'll be back"}
{"text":"After posting my first review, to their credit, they asked for feedback what went wrong and after we explained problems with both service and the food they sent a gift card suggesting we try again. So I went back a couple of weeks ago and tried two different 'mexican-style' breakfasts - they offered to bring the 2nd one when I told them I thought the first was very bland and blah. The 2nd was equally bland. Gave them this feedback and spoke with who I think is one of the owners or managers and he comped the meal. Went back again this morning to give it another try with my daughter. The service has improved dramatically and there were a lot more staff (that said, I always find it a bit invasive of your personal space when a waiter sits down at your table with you to take your order - otherwise he was charming but bordering on obsequious). We really want to like this place as it seems to be very popular and reading the menu, everything sounds delicious - but both my daughter and I thought our food was bland in both taste and presentation and consistently doesn't live up to the menu's hyperbole (e.g., the 'Grapefruit brul√©e' being just half a grapefruit with melted sugar on it). The best parallel we could come up with is that the food seems cafeteria-like with little to no seasoning or inspiration... If they can do work on what comes out of the kitchen, we'd go back..."}
{"text":"I went for brunch today with friends.  It was really delicious!  The staff is super friendly and service was prompt.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I took the morning off work to run errands so decided to take advantage of the weekday and head here for brunch  (I heard the wait on weekends is insane). I couldn't decide which Benny to order so ordered the dual. This gives you the opportunity to try two different kinds. One was the salmon and the other was prosciutto. I was pleasantly surprised with the salmon and I loved their hash browns. I'm not sure when I'll make it back again but I've been thinking of those hash browns ever since!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious!...whatever you like...ask for Jenna...excellent service...very friendly too.
The coffee is delicious...robust without that bitter Starbuck bite.

Put it on your foodie list!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast spots. The pancake flight is great because you can select three different pancakes. Their sweet potato pancake is a must try. The service is fast and friendly. There's usually a wait to be seated, but well worth it!"}
{"text":"This is a must. If you have never been to a snooze you are missing out. The staff is very friendly and accommodating and the food and drinks are always top notch!!! They do get busy because of this so if you don't like waiting during the busy hours then go somewhere else and leave me a spot instead!!! :-)"}
{"text":"Perfect breakfast place! Corned beef hash was excellent!  We were given a sample cinnamon roll pancake that was just perfect.   Fruit was fresh.  Service was excellent.  They were there when they needed to be but they did not hover."}
{"text":"I came in on a Sunday morning. For a party of four, the wait was 30-45 minutes. I was fine with that and put my name in. However, I ended up waiting over an hour for a table. The hostesses kept telling us 5 more minutes, meanwhile they kept seating parties of two at tables made for four people. This place needs to get a better system for seating people. Would not come back here for breakfast."}
{"text":"Love this place. We are Seattleites and made our 2nd visit to Snooze in May.  I still think about the breakfast tacos (with added pulled pork and avocado), The hollandaise is amazing.  My husband had the Chilaquiles benedict and loved it also. Everything is very fresh and the portions are really large enough to share."}
{"text":"Snooze has been a hit in Scottsdale since the day it opened - of you don't get here by 830, expect a wait - sometimes up to an hour. Everything we've tried here has been great from the pancake flights (flavors change by season) to the breakfast burrito. Drinks are also tasty and refreshing - especially if you're on the patio in the summer. Dog friendly patio is a bonus!"}
{"text":"Snooze invited us to return and try them again. We visited on April 13 and everything came out as requested and tasted good. I had the classic again and husband had the tacos, and we shared the French toast neat. The French toast was probably the best tasting item we have tried so far. Our server was Ashley and she was pleasant and attentive."}
{"text":"I usually go to the one on camelback and was in the area so we stopped by for some breakfast here! I was sort of disappointed. I usually enjoy the Chile Verde Benedict and the portion size and just the meal itself tasted different! I felt like the service was not point like how it usually is at the other Snooze."}
{"text":"First time in, awesome experience!! There was a 45 min wait for a table but we were able to grab a seat at the bar & eat right away. Delicious infused vodka Bloody Mary, awesome food, fun ambiance, and outstanding service by Robert!"}
{"text":"We had a delightful brunch there last weekend.  It was a long wait 45 minutes, but worth it.  Service was great.  The atmosphere was fun.  Loved the bloody mary!  We had OMG French Toast and the Pancake flight -so so good."}
{"text":"Best breakfast.  Gluten free pancakes were off the chart.  I will eat here every time I come to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Today I'm having the corn beef hash and Pumpkin pancake and the service is great nice place"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in to Snooze, for the first time, after hitting some balls at Crackerjax. It was crowded as if it was the weekend, but it was Friday a.m. at 10:30. Despite the crowd, we were seated right away, and our server took our drink orders right away too. When our waitress walked back over, I asked for a glass of ice and a straw. Nearly 15 minutes later, my husband flagged down another server, who took our food order. I told her I would like a glass of ice and straw. The first server, who we hadn't seen in 15 minutes delivers my glass of ice and my husband had to retrieve a straw for me. A man with an Australian accent stops by our table and asks \"How's everything going?\" I said \"So far, not so good.\" He than said he will check on our food orders. This man never stopped by again. When my husband's food came, it was room temp (cold by his standards), so it was sent back and the 2nd order was not up to par either. The establisment comped my husband's meal, but we will not be back. We'll just continue to patronize our fav Kierland spots, such as Zinc Bistro, the Sam Fox spots and soon, Postino's. Good luck to you Snooze, but we'll pass. By the way, no one ever gave us a glass of water : ("}
{"text":"Flavor, flavor, flavor! Best breakfast in AZ - look forward to trying more dishes on the menu. We ate with 4 friends and everyone ordered something different and we shared family style...nothing disappointed."}
{"text":"Snooze is an incredible breakfast spot that I think can please just about everyone.  There's a bit of a wait but it's worth it.  The menu has a ton of different options and they are so flexible to let you customize to get exactly what you want.  The ingredients are also really fresh.  Some highlights include allowing you to sub a huge pancake for hash browns in your order and letting you do a Benedict duo.  Great breakfast location!"}
{"text":"It was busy, noisy and crowded!  The food was above average and the service was not very good.  We ended up with one of those bench two-tops where you're so close to your neighbors that you can't help but eavesdrop. They have a full bar  which is the new hip thing for a breakfast place.  I would try again on a weekday when it is not so busy."}
{"text":"Amazing! Seriously amazing! So good, I googled if I could open a chain back home. Do not miss the Benny Duo if you like a savory breakfast with a little kick...the carnitas on top of a corn cake with poached egg and green chili sauce...to die for! For sweets, the pineapple upside down pancake is out of this world yummy! Plus they offer a full bar with many craft cocktails for brunch. The wait is long but rightfully so."}
{"text":"Great place.... And I'm not even a breakfast eater!!! Good food. Cute atmosphere! Nice staff. Kierland parking is always sketchy. Details were well thought out in this concept restaurant all the way to well balanced silverware!"}
{"text":"What a cool place...has a fun and funky 70's vibe. I went with the traditional eggs and bacon, which was good, but try something a bit more unique. I realized everyone else's food was much better. I did order a side bfast taco and that was great. Don't get me wrong, my breakfast was totally fine, but standard; you can get it anywhere. 

Point is: this place offers much more than your average breakfast joint, so try something new! All their food was fantastic. The jelly was home made by a local vendor. I would have ordered more toast just for the jelly if I hadn't already ate everyone else's food, haha. 

Definitely a must try while in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Waited for about 40 minutes, no biggie just went to the next door Starbucks and grabbed a coffee to kill time. Started off breakfast with a delicious Bloody Mary...or maybe two. Husband had the breakfast burrito, which was delicious and certainly large enough for two people. I had the chiliquilies and hash browns which was to die for. 

The decor was adorable- like the jetsons meets boy band heaven. Our waitress was pleasant and on top of the meal start to finish. All in all, a really fantastic breakfast! Will be back when we are in the area again."}
{"text":"Good food. OK service.   Wasn't real impressed by the prices or the value.   $4 to add a plain pancake?  Seriously?

Hash browns weren't great, ham was dry.  Eggs done perfectly.  The pancake was dry as well."}
{"text":"Wow. This food was amazing! The only downside to this place is the wait. Their estimate for our wait was accurate though. They also text you to tell you your table will be ready soon so we could walk around and see some of the shops before heading back. 

This is a great place for kids since it's pretty noisy, so we didn't feel as though my nephew was disturbing others. They brought out some fruit for the kids before taking our orders to keep them occupied as well as crayons and paper. . The waitress was extremely nice and not at all phased by the kids. 

Most importantly, the food. My friend's cappuccino had a little heart in it which she loved. The mimosas were delicious as well.  I chose to make an egg white omelette (they allow you to add three items from the choices) which came with toast and hash browns. So delicious! I went with mushrooms, caramelized onions and mozzarella - which was fresh. My sister and friend loved the hash browns; I loved their fluffy toast. Finally, my friend and I split a peanut butter cup pancake (gluten free) and it was perfect: not too sweet nor too heavy. I will definitely come back here the next time I'm in Arizona and any other locations they may have!"}
{"text":"Seated right away, both my daughter and I were treated nicely and our food was great. Looking forward to another visit!"}
{"text":"Good food, friendly staff... coffee is too bold for me but the latte is a good replacement :)"}
{"text":"The only way to start your day is by having the Bangkok bloody mary with breakfast at Snooze! Probably the best tasting bloody mary I've had.  Breakfast is always great,  and the service impeccable.  Jordan is the best server I ever had.   Her engaging attitude made eating here fun!"}
{"text":"Am Manhattan is awesome.   Great place and great staff.    It's really busy though.  Be prepared to wait on occasion."}
{"text":"Good food! I go for the eggs Benedict. They've never let me down. Be prepared for a longer wait on weekends. It's a popular spot."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot - I couldn't decide what to get so I got their basic breakfast (2 eggs scrambled, soy chorizo, hash browns and I substituted the toast for one of their sweet potato pancakes) with coffee. First off - I want to thank them for having faux meat and soy milk for my coffee. That is extremely difficult to come by and I can't tell you how many places don't have soy milk. I was actually worried that the sweet potato pancake was going to be too sweet bc of the caramel (which I don't even like) but it was made to perfection. The hash browns had a unique and flavorful seasoning to them. The coffee was very hot. And the portions were a perfect size. Overall this place is very good because of their wide variety of unique options and cool interior design. I plan to come back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Had great service and was directed on a few of their best dishes and I had a great meal!

My wife and I love coming here and it's awesome!"}
{"text":"It was busy but service was great and food was delicious. The menu options made it hard to choose but I got the breakfast pot pie and it's a must and the cherry tart mimosa was so good. My husband got the breakfast burrito and it was huge. He only ate half. You could definitely split it. I can't wait to go back. Wish we had one in OKC."}
{"text":"Snooze nails it on the head with its concept. It's a breakfast joint and focuses solely on that. So much so that it's only open for brunch (until 2:30 for you late risers).
While you're still getting caffeinated, their awesome staff is perky and friendly. If you haven't been yet, definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"You Snooze, you lose.  This place gets pretty packed on the weekends, so expect a wait!  The first two times, we went, we were told it's going to be 60 to 90 minutes, this time we went around 9:30 and the wait was only 30 minutes.  So I know most good breakfast joints have waits, so this place is no different.  Its located next to PF Changs and Starbucks in Kierland.  The place itself isn't very big, but its nicely decorated and had a good feel to the place.  After we were seated, we were greeted pretty quickly.  The lady was super friendly and nice.  So we ordered 3 different dishes and shared them.  All three dishes were good, and I'm not a big fan of French Toast, but this was pretty damn good.  The portion sizes of the meals were pretty standard, and were presented nicely.  Overall, pretty solid experience and would recommend this place.  To me, its still not as good as the Original Breakfast House by my house, but still pretty impressive."}
{"text":"A very creative atmosphere with delicious food! The wait time is a little long on the weekends and it's a bit noisy inside. But the menu selection makes up for it. If you haven't been there yet, you must make it."}
{"text":"I ordered the breakfast burrito with green sauce. When it came out I was surprised how large it was  unfortunately it went down hill from there. The green sauce was dried up almost instantly. Then I cut into the burrito itself   What a huge disappointment it was like eating a potato.  Over 90% hash browns. I think they only used one egg. Basically, it was a dried up green sauce Potato wrap. Before I knew it the waitress said here's the bill. I told here about the wrap and she took it back and said sorry next time the could fix it. After only eating one bite I thought they could fix it now. Well she did not even attempt to correct the problem. Instead she was more interested in clearing the table and making room for the large line of people waiting for tables."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place so bad! Pros - our waitress was super sweet and attentive, pancakes were unique and delicious. Cons - eggs Benedict portion was very tiny and extremely oily."}
{"text":"Servers very unfriendly, long wait over one hour, food has deteriorated since the last time we are here. Do not recommend it. Bathrooms very dirty looked like someone threw up in the men's sink."}
{"text":"My inner foodie has fallen in love with Scottsdale! Snooze was our last breakfast stop during our visit and it did not disappoint!

 The interior is very chic and fun, throughout our time there I noted the staff dancing and enjoying themselves which I just loved to note. It shows the company takes good care of their employees which as a manager is something I always appreciate.

 Our attendant Ashley was thorough in explaining the menu, after asking and receiving that we had not experienced them before, and he special \"pancake\" for the day. Quotations required as it was bacon strips dipped in batter and fried up.
 I opted for the Benny Duo l, side note the fact that they offer such a thing as well as a pancake flight for all us foodies/indecisive diners is amazing. The Bella Bella with prosciutto on Ciabatta was very unique offering a crispy bite from the bread along with the salty delight of the meat and the sauce... YUM! A balsamic glaze with cream cheese hollandaise like what?! The other was the Early Harvest which was by far the best Benny I have ever had the pleasure of consuming. The veggie ragout was so flavorful and the sauce had a nice kick from the red pepper. I opted for a pancake over the hash browns, I was surprised however that they charged full price from the a la cart menu even without the potatoes and that wasn't mentioned by Ashley when she suggested the sub... 
 I ordered the goodness cake, it was not as fluffy as the traditional likely because of the quinoa but it was good and the honey lemon yogurt was really something. One was plenty, I only finished half.
 Hubby ordered the burrito, the only add in being poblano peppers. That being said Ashley did say it was a bit bland without add ins such as meat and it proved to be so however the green sauce was like salsa verse and came smothered, that was nice.

Definitely a must try especially for any Benedict fans"}
{"text":"Good concept of food, but unfortunately the food was only lukewarm, borderline cold. Presentation was nice, but not worth the wait and not worth the price either. Everything was under seasoned. Hot, fresh food is hard to do when the kitchen staff is seen socializing through the windows. Oh well. Thanks anyways."}
{"text":"Excellent food & excellent customer service. The jalepeno Bloody Mary was pretty amazing as well. I'll definitely go back & I highly recommend this place. Great place for breakfast & then a walk in the mall. Very busy! I recommend going early on weekends"}
{"text":"Worth the wait. I can't describe how happy we were with eating at Snooze. The service was remarkable. Thank you, Chris, for being a ln amazing server. We were forst time customers and we were welcomed from the get-go.  The food was amazingly delicious, and the mimosas were marvelous. We will be back."}
{"text":"Great breakfast! I've been 3-4 times and while I don't like the wait, the good is delish! The pancakes are good, bacon is so tasty and their coffee is great! Cannot wait to try more of their menu items !"}
{"text":"Food is good but noise makes your head hurt. Waited 75 minutes for a table for two.  Asked to be seated in a booth and was told their manager had asked they reserve the booth for larger parties.  Two minutes later, they seated a  party of two in the booth."}
{"text":"As always this place is incredible!  Great food, drinks and service.  Hannah was great and is my new favorite server here.  Got the Benny duo and mimosas"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time for breakfast. So delicious! The pancake of the day was a bananas foster pancake...So juicy! Our server Lila was awesome, the kitchen brought out a pancake on the house! Everyone was so friendly and helpful, we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We live locally and eat breakfast out frequently. First time here and other than the close quarters for diners, the experience was great. Our server Austin learned that we were first timers and surprised us with a complimentary pancake just to try! My corned beef hash was the best I have had anywhere in this area and my husband enjoyed his classic breakfast. Top notch service from Austin and we'll be back. P.S. The pancake was a pineapple upside and sooooooooooooooooooooooooo wonderful!"}
{"text":"This is the place for the perfect indulgent breakfast, and it's well suited for people like me who can't decide between all of the options thanks to the Benny duo and the pancake flight. Or if you want some protein but still craving one of the pancakes, you can substitute toast for any one pancake when ordering one of the egg dishes. 

I first went to Snooze in Ft. Collins, CO 3 years ago and I was so happy to hear they put one in my home town! Snooze did not disappoint in this new location. The service was friendly, efficient and quick. I ordered the scramble with the Punkin Pancake subbed for the toast and it was truly the best of both worlds."}
{"text":"Been to both locations near me and love both! Breakfast was great and so fresh ! I highly recommend the bennies ! Anyone of the bennies are fantastic ! Give yourself a little extra time they are busy . They are well worth s short wait!"}
{"text":"I usually love snooze, but when I went this past weekend, I was seriously underwhelmed by the quality of the food I received. My eggs were tough and Luke warm when they got out to me, abs the avocado I asked for as a side looked far from fresh. Will be back to give one of my favorite brunch spots another try."}
{"text":"Great breakfast great service will be back soon. A lot of great choices. Wide variety of items and everything we had was cooked perfect"}
{"text":"Ashley served us amazing food at reasonable prices and after she asked if our rings were new and we told her about our recent wedding she brought out a blueberry streusel pancake just for us! Thank you Ashley!"}
{"text":"OK third time giving this place a try, this time at this newer location. Great atmosphere and service. But food is just not that great. Bacon has strange and fatty taste. Hash browns have no flavor. Omelet very bland. And most important..coffee is average.  Unfortunate because so conveniently located. Many breakfast places around so need to step up the food!"}
{"text":"Pretty good biscuits and gravy. However, ready to press snooze on this joint--good but typical fare."}
{"text":"Whoa lots of food but really delicious and fresh. I'm excited to come back and try more :)."}
{"text":"I went there today for lunch with my sister in law. It was my first time there. I was so excited and heard good things about this place. I got the breakfast classic, I was a little disappointed. My food was cold. My has brown was very salty. The only good thing on my plate was the chicken sausage. Also the music was very loud. I can barley hear the waitress or the company I was with. My overall experience there was okay."}
{"text":"If you want a good warm latte this is not the place.   I've been here 3 times and every time my drink wasn't even luke warm.  Not to mention the first time no one brought our drinks to our table.  I went up after 10 minutes and got our drinks myself.  The food is not bad but if you want a much better coffee go across the street to Press."}
{"text":"Place is always packed!! Really good mimosas and drinks for brunch and the food is pretty darn good for the price. Also, they have good choices for eggs benedict!!"}
{"text":"There's always a wait for a reason! It has the best breakfast food in Scottsdale. I wish the location was bigger inside though! We always wait 20 minutes at least which is a little annoying. I love the \"sandwich I am\" it's a big size on a pretzel roll. Pretty standard but the sauce on the side is really good! The pancakes are probably the best thing on the menu! The cinnamon roll pancakes are so good! They had a special flavor last time we were there, orange creamsicle pancakes omg. The best thing I've ever had. Wish they would make them permanent on the menu! Overall this place is always good. Try it!"}
{"text":"This is our go to for breakfast dates. Today was an exceptional experience. Our waitress Sarah was super attentive, and did a hilaaaaarious New York mom impression. Best of all, say hi to the Aussie, the last two times I've been there he's gone out of his way to choose our seats and make us feel welcome, recognized me right off the bat. He's one of those dudes you can just tell is a really good guy. Give him a high five from us."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch and got the eggs benedict with salmon! Was really good and enjoyed it very much. Ended up getting counter seating because just came here with one other person, but this was good, because service was much faster.

Really love the interior! I like how the colors are so different from other restaurants.

Brunch may be a little crowded because it is quite popular, but definitely recommend coming!"}
{"text":"It was delicious. I got the \"I want sum'oa cakes\" they were so delicious but I would like to have the toppings and sauce on the second pancake that is below the delicious first one."}
{"text":"The only reason this review is getting a 4 star is because of the 1 hour- 1.5 hour wait. After you get over that part, the food is amazing. The service is decently fast as well. I got the breakfast sandwich on a pretzel roll and my boyfriend and i shared the coffee and donuts pancake. That pancake was phenomenal. The cappuccino is also really good. Every time we come we end up sharing the french toast or pancake. The hashbrowns need more seasoning.. but everything else is so good!"}
{"text":"First off the name of the restaurant caught our attention, Snooze.  We went in and fell in love with the decorations and come to find out it is built out of sustainable and repurposed materials.  The look is a cross between the 50's and The Jetsons.  The colors used are orange and blues with pictures of jacks on the wall.

The food was Outstanding!  We enjoy everything. I had a sweet potato pancake which was the best I have ever had, this is saying a lot. It had caramelized pecans and a maple syrup.   Also, our table of four received the eggs Benedict's which was one of several choices available.  We order the breakfast special with choice of eggs, sausage, toast, vegetable frittata, and omelette.  Even though Starbucks is next door, they have nothing on this place's speciality coffee drinks.     
Thank you Darren and Lauren for being so pleasant and making our breakfast experience great.  

I wish I had more pictures but my party consumed it before I could pictures. Lol."}
{"text":"Snooze is a cool little hip joint tucked in Kierland Commons.  The breakfast is quite good, although I would say it's a little bit overpriced for what you get.  They have a nice variety of quality foods though.  I appreciated that they are dog friendly in the patio area which can make it or break it if you like to haul your dog everywhere (like me).  Downsides to this place is that there is always a lengthy wait and the patio area is a little bit cluttered.  We went one time and although the food was great, I think that was just about all the snooze I can handle."}
{"text":"New, fast, fresh, and very friendly! They have good #greenchile and unique flatware ;) @snoozeameatery #NationalBaconDay"}
{"text":"Love love love the sweet potato pancake, and eggs Benedict!! This has become a regular breakfast spot for us"}
{"text":"I wish I could give them a million stars! This place is sooooo cute! The food is amazing as well! I ordered a flight of pancakes and each one was great! I couldn't have had a better breakfast! Hash browns are delish but I was so full from the pancakes I couldn't finish them. Super casual and very affordable for great quality. Our server was a sweetheart! I will def be taking anybody I know here! Very nice set up outside too if it's a decent day to be out! The wait is a little long but it is absolutely worth it! Even the straw quality of this place is a five star. So sturdy."}
{"text":"Food was amazing and service was outstanding!!! Recommend sitting outside to people watch. So many items to choose from!! My new fav brunch spot!!!"}
{"text":"First visit today arriving around 1pm. There was a 15 minute wait but not bad. The wait for our food was about 10-15 minutes. You can dine inside or on the patio. If you would like to chat with your other guests it might be better to sit outside as it is pretty loud inside. The menu offers a nice selection of some unique breakfast items. We tried the breakfast pot pie. It sounds unusual but was very good.  It consists of a puffed pastry on the bottom with ingredients you select on top along with an egg.

Coffee is good and is mild to medium. It comes from Guatemala.  Waiter was pretty focused on a table of ladies and neglected to refill my cup.  I got up and got my own refill.  He later gave me a refill so all was good.  The ladies at the other table were more fun than me and my wife I am sure.....

Give the place a try and if you don't like the wait, service or food you can go next door to P.F. Changs or many of the other nearby restaurants."}
{"text":"The Chili Verde Eggs Benedict is basically to die for.  You can't go wrong eating here."}
{"text":"Spent a few days in Scottsdale golfing with some friends and we found this place on yelp and we were not disappointed. They service each day was prompt and friendly and the food was great. The line can get long because it is not a large restaurant but it is with waiting. We actually ate there 2 of 3 mornings and the pick 2 Benedict's was what we went with. I would definitely go back if I was in Scottsdale. In fact it is one of those special places that make you think it would go well in your hometown."}
{"text":"I don't really eat sweets (pancakes, waffles, etc) for breakfast, but I will here. The pineapple upside down pancake us one of the best things I have ever eaten. Breakfast burrito is very good too. I have been here a handful of times and although the wait can be long, the service is great once you get a table. 

One of my favorite breakfast spots in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"I go to Snooze allllll the time. The staff is great, service is friendly and quick, and very clean! Their coffee is smooth and I like that they have a nice variety on their menu."}
{"text":"Wow... the Benedicts were amazing. The fact that you can get two separate benedicts is a great feature. The breakfast drinks were unique and amazing as well. This is our 3rd spring training trip in 3 years and we will be adding Snooze to our tradition of restaurants to frequent upon our return."}
{"text":"What a great breakfast place.  Took an out of town guest to Snooze and she loved it.  I will make it a regular stop when I have visitors.  Pancakes were delish!"}
{"text":"I love the pancake trio with sweet potato, cinnamon roll and peanut butter cup! The caprese Benedict is amazing too"}
{"text":"So good we came here two days in a row!

Located just ~0.5 miles from the Westin Kierland Resort, this proved to be a delicious breakfast option during a recent stay. 

The menu is creative and everything we tried was delicious. The \"ahh la carte\" section of the menu is great if you can't make up your mind or just want to have more variety. The pancakes (available in lots of different flavors) looked tempting and have received great reviews, but I also wanted to try to the savory breakfast tacos, so I ordered a taco plus a single pancake.

Service was very friendly, though we noticed that it was a bit slow when the restaurant was full. This is to be expected, but make sure you plan accordingly if you want to dine at peak time."}
{"text":"Snooze has been my #1 favorite breakfast option since living very near the Tempe location. After recently moving to the north Scottsdale area, I was very excited to learn that another location had recently opened up here as well.

I visited Snooze two mornings in a row this past week, early. Service was outstanding, as always. I came to expect this in Tempe and was so happy to find that the same level of quality service is mirrored at this location as well.

My second morning here, multiple of the staff remembered me from the day before and even sat me in the same booth. Even the young man who delivered my food from the kitchen recognized me and made a point of saying so and welcoming me back.

I ordered the breakfast tacos my first morning and the breakfast burrito the following morning. Both dishes were outstanding, although I'd cast my vote in favor of the tacos, surprisingly enough (I'm usually a burrito guy, but those tacos were SOLID!).

Both mornings, I stayed for about an hour, taking my time to do some reading and prepare for my work day. Both mornings, my server was very friendly and attentive without being intrusive, and both mornings, my server kept my cup of coffee filled and hot.

Honestly, if I could give Snooze 10 stars, I would. The overall experience is just everything you hope for when you visit a branded eatery like this. The styling and overall ambiance is unlike anything I've seen anywhere else. Always bright, always clean, always so Snooze!

If you haven't visited Snooze yet, you need to. That's all there is to it. Get there early or sleep in and make a brunch of it. You will NOT be disappointed - I'm sure of it. Grab some Snooze merch while you're there, too! (I *love* my Snooze hat and wear it everywhere!!)

Thank you, Snooze, for being so consistently outstanding in everything you do, from food to ambiance to service. I feel right at home every time I ever visit, and that means an awful lot. Five stars many times over - you've earned it!"}
{"text":"I had the ham Benedict. It was delicious. Would absolutely order it again. My wife had the pot pie and she didn't love it. Not that it wasn't good, just that it didn't seem to be a breakfast item."}
{"text":"This is the place to be if you're in Scottsdale! This is a very popular location so be prepared to wait a little bit before you sit down at your table. The staff is courteous and upbeat. The menu offers you a little bit of everything without sacrificing quality. Snooze also features a great drink menu that incorporates anything from lattes to bloody Mary's and even mimosas. While you are here you must try the Danish pancakes and the Benidict III you will love it!"}
{"text":"Went in here with a buddy of mine and the service was incredibly friendly! No wonder my friend is a regular there. The service was quick & they were very personable, which is awesome and rare I feel like I'm a cafe. :) love the atmosphere and just everything about this place!"}
{"text":"Simply put. The food was great, atmosphere was great, and the service was great. I had the Benny Duo, wife had the Pancake Flight, and our neighbors had the Sam I Am which looked crazy good."}
{"text":"Visiting from Cali and found Snooze from Yelp with great reviews.  Food was delicious! I ordered the \"I Want Sum'oa Cakes\" - it's packed with lots of sweetness.  Service was prompt and friendly.  Must try while in AZ."}
{"text":"Love this place!  They have the best eggs benedicts and pancakes I've ever had.  The Bella Bella Benny is my favorite, it has slices of prosciutto, cheese, and poached eggs on toasted ciabatta, topped with cream cheese hollandaise, balsamic glaze and arugula. The Sandwich I Am is also yummy, but I get it with bacon instead of sausage.  Snooze is great about letting you modify your order and they encourage you to come up with creative ideas on a dish you'd like.  I also like the fact you can get 1/2 orders if you're not too hungry.  In addition, the servers are always extremely helpful and friendly.   

I don't like pancakes, or least I never did until I had one at Snooze.  My two favorites are the Smashin' Pumpkin Pancake which is filled with cream cheese and topped with bourbon infused maple syrup, sweet cream drizzle and maple spiced pipitas and the Cinnamon Roll pancake.  

My only two complaints about Snooze, and what kept me from giving it 5 stars, are 1) the wait time - I wish they'd get the \"Nowait\" app which would make me much more inclined to eat there on the weekend, and 2) the mimosas - I think because the champagne comes out of a machine rather than a bottle it never tastes very bubbly, always a little flat."}
{"text":"After a hot and sweaty hike up Camelback I came here to refuel. Got a protein smoothie and avo and eggs. Hit the spot!

Side note: I feel like this place would be fun to meet up with your girlfriends."}
{"text":"Even for Monday brunch this place is packed and has an exciting atmosphere. Cute mid-century modern diner feel. Unique, delicious drinks (had Snooze Fashioned and Palomimosa). Food was 'out of this world' good! Early harvest benedict is a must try for all veggie lovers. French toast is a amazing, although, it could use a little more fresh fruit. Service was very attentive and friendly. Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Rewind your clocks to 1950, Scottsdale! Snooze puts a millennial spin on the American diner, serving breakfast classics with a modern flair. I ordered the \"Sandwich I Am,\" a delicious egg, cheese, and sausage sandwich served on pretzel roll buns and with a side of hollandaise sauce, as well as the \"Blueberry Danish Pancakes,\" classic pancakes topped with a blueberry drizzle, almond crumbles, sugar, and lemon filling. Both were fabulous! I'd definitely recommend this place when coming to town! And shout-out to Melanie, our waitress, for her superb service!"}
{"text":"We came for the great food we grew to love in Denver, but this location is the best of all.... not only was the food incredible, but our server, Heather, went above and beyond!!! 

I travel nationwide for work, and eat out often.... so, when I see an authentic, friendly, prompt, and helpful server with such a great smile, I'm impressed.... it's rare to get someone that loves what they do like she does! We're coming back because of her!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Such delicious, fresh food! The breakfast tacos were absolutely amazing. I also really appreciated that when they originally gave me flour tortillas, which I cannot eat, the fixed it and comped it!
 Kind of a long wait to get seated, but well worth it!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is so cool! 1960/70's themed decor was super cute. They have a fairly large patio area but the tables are all very close together. I was disappointed with where I was put to sit because it was in a corner by the bar, I couldn't appreciate my surrounding bed cause I couldn't see around the corner. I could have asked to move (some people next to me did) but I didn't want to be THAT person that takes up a full table for just one person. 

Anyway, I ordered the Snooze Classic which is eggs, meat, hash browns, and toast. I subbed my toast for a pineapple upside down pancake (which was the best decision I made all morning!) My food was cooked really well and tasted great, I'm just not sure it was worth the money and the pretty sizable up charge for substituting the pancake. That being said, I would definitely go back again but it'd be for that pineapple pancake!"}
{"text":"Oh my. We had bourbon and sweet potato pancakes and the corned beef hash. Heaven in our mouths. Lovely and many more enticing menu items for next visits!"}
{"text":"Excellent light breakfast of the lower east side. It was artisan bread, herbed goat cheese, and tomato caper relish with a perfectly dressed argula salad. The bloody mary I had was the Bangkok bloody mary it was delicious. Side note next time I will wait for a table inside. We sat outside and at 9 am in the morning the sun made it hot. My mistake I live in AZ and know better. Service was excellent and the wait was maybe 5 minutes for a Sunday morning."}
{"text":"The only reason I didnt give 5 stars is because I paid 11$ for eggs Benedict and a delicious hashbrown muffin creation(which was amazing). But if everything is free range/ natural ingredients like they claim then you get what you pay for. Quality food."}
{"text":"The eggs Benny that we had were great but our hash browns were cold and raw still-gross! The wait was long but expected for Sunday brunch. I recommend you order your hash browns well done and you'll be happy with everything else."}
{"text":"Amazing food! I will say you do need to get here early on the weekends as 2 of us did wait 45 minutes for a table. Anywhere on the weekends is pretty busy anyways but wellllll worth the wait. The breakfast tacos were delicious and my mimosas was perfect! Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"You just can't go wrong with Snooze. I've eaten in, I think, three different locations and all the food is always superb. I've yet to get anything that I was like, never again. The only think that while good, just wasn't my style was the PB pancake. Just a little too much for me.

At this location I sat outside in May and it was perfect brunch weather!"}
{"text":"This is as good as it gets!  The best breakfast around!  The breakfast tacos are delicious and they have a selection of unique add ins (including vegetarian soyrizo).  The breakfast burrito is a close second favorite! 
My husband enjoys the \"pancake of the day\".  We are regulars and have yet to see the same flavor- always something yummy and creative!
The staff are attentive and all seem to have a fun personality.  Chris is great!  
We love this place!"}
{"text":"I don't Yelp, but Snooze brings out a new side of me. Love this place. Always a friendly atmosphere and great service. I recommend getting your hash browns \"flat and crispy\" (as they call it), I prefer the term \"smash browns\", but that's just me. The staff is always full of energy and appear to enjoy working there. There is a sense of community amongst guests as well as staff. Almost half the people in here, whether employees or guests, seem to know one another's names. I often bring my daughters here and the staff never fail to come say hello and make them feel welcome (probably because they're super cute). The managers (Zach, CiCi, and Darren) are always present, and the servers (Rob, Amber, Jordan, Hannah, Melanie, Amy, and Eric) are very knowledgeable and attentive. Despite often being on a wait, the service is typically quick and accurate. Try the tacos, the Ruben, the Lower East Side, or of the pancakes. Or ... whatever you prefer."}
{"text":"This place is over rated , best location though, but the food wasn't that good . O.M.G French toast was so dry didn't like it"}
{"text":"The best breakfast food on the planet. The people here make it even better. You won't find a better place than this. Shoutout to Cray 

Update: I can LITERALLY not go anywhere else for breakfast food besides Snooze. Nothing compares, ever.

Update v2. Also the people who work here are incredible. My wife and I come here every weekend and we've grown to know all of them. It feels like home coming here.

GF friends! They have a TON of gluten free options here."}
{"text":"Omg - I am a breakfast person but nobody else has a breakfast like Snooze. Whenever I am in Scottsdale I try to make it there.......my only complaint is they are not open later!  My favorite, Bella Bella Benny."}
{"text":"Aaaaaamazing service and such a cute place! Their Dr. Seuss pancake was bomb! Thank you Snooze, for making my boyfriend's birthday breakfast really special!"}
{"text":"Eggs Benedict was small, food was cold which for $14 you'd think the portion would be good and it would come out hot.    You ever eat cold hollandaise?-it's gross.   I'd let the server know kindly even though she came out only at the end of the meal. She didn't seem to care about it too much. Why should I care to come back?"}
{"text":"The staff is super friendly and the service is pretty good. What does annoy me and the group that I recently ate with was that the staff can't acknowledge pets! This is a dog friendly place and brings in a lot of customers to the patio with dogs, we brought two with us last week. But someone complained saying that the staff should not be allowed to let dogs and I find this ridiculous to say the least.
Don't get me wrong, I understand that for health and sanitary reasons they shouldn't be sitting on the floor playing with the animals, but telling them not to pet the dogs at tables? That's just too picky. We bring our dogs so that they can be socialized and talked to and pet by random people, let your staff go back to this! (Wash your hands if you deal with food after, easy enough.)"}
{"text":"pineapple pancakes. snooze fashioned drink. perfection. 

JUST DO IT. DON'T LET YOUR DREAMS JUST BE DREAMS. 

Cici manages the front of house effectively. The challenge at the Kierland location is how small the dining room is. Like no joke it almost reminds me of how small Denver HQ. But small doesn't mean unmanageable. Thankfully Snooze is tech driven and has simple yet brilliant text messaging capabilities with prospective tables."}
{"text":"Came to visit from California & decided to stop and eat here. We were given a 40 minute wait time but it was only about 20. The food was great, service was pretty quick and easy. Me & girlfriend would definitely re-visit. :)"}
{"text":"Were here on vacation and Snooze got good reviews so we tried it.  Food was very good, service was very good but the noise level makes this a four-star eatery.  Sure, in this space-age restaurant you expect voices bouncing off the walls but they insisted on playing a night-club-like drum beat at 9:30am that was simply too loud.  We almost had to shout at each other to hold a conversation across a small table.  Maybe it's quieter outside on the misted patio?

If they'd turn the volume down (below eleven) then it would've gotten five stars."}
{"text":"Had such a wonderful experience for our first time at snooze! Jordan was such a great server! Very attentive and cheerful! The food runner Andrea made sure our food was presentable and did it with a smile(: will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"Got takeout today and food was amazing. Got a burrito and grilled cheese. The girl who took my order( wish I got her name) had a great personality and very engaging. Definitely recommend Snooze."}
{"text":"It was very good very loud. Very good food. Loved the pancakes and egg dishes The staff was great."}
{"text":"Found this place by accident but we loved it. Our waitress Aimee was amazing. My wife has celiac and Aimee immediately put us at ease. She recommended some amazing options. Everything was tasty and well presented. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I was a little unsure at first whether to go to snooze because of long waits and also because I didn't have a lactose pill -- and what good food can you get without dairy?!

Well, this location was amazing. It may have just been fate, but there were 2 spots at the bar, so we didn't have a wait. And then I asked the bartender/waitress plenty of questions, which she was happy to answer. I told her I couldn't do dairy, and she went the extra mile to make sure that the chilaquiles benedict I ordered didn't have any dairy whatsoever. Instead of the hollandaise sauce, they used a red and a green sauce that paired nicely and felt clean! I was impressed.

I also ordered a side of sweet potato pancakes which my cousin said are the best thing she's ever had at snooze. Not a bad first time at snooze! 

I went to the Biltmore area snooze a week later and was also impressed, that time by their smoked salmon/goat cheese/boiled egg/rye bread dish. Pretty creative combination, I thoroughly enjoyed that brunch item too!"}
{"text":"Why didn't I order extra pancakes to take home for lunch??! I got the pumpkin pancake, half order, and they were amazing. Besides pumpkin spice, they used seasoned pumpkin seeds and a cream cheese butter spread for pure mouth watering delight. On all of their pancake options (of which there are about ten tantalizing varieties) you can opt to make them gluten free. Woo hoo!

The style of the restaurant was bright and cheery. They packed many people on the patio and inside but somehow it didn't feel overcrowded. It was a delight just to be present in such an upbeat and buzzy type of place.

Why the four stars? Our server was great- pleasant, confident, friendly, knowledgable but it took a really long time to get our bill and then get it processed at the end. That may not have been enough to take it from five to four stars but on top of it we had to move the bench slightly and discovered a full pancake on the ground. Not really their fault if they couldn't see it, but kind of gross to have it down there for the meal.

Those last points are so minor that I would never hold it against them. I eagerly look forward to our next visit. I fully intend to dive into one of their egg Benedict specialties next time!"}
{"text":"Today I had the chilaquiles Benedict recommended by Hannah. IT WAS AMAZING. Hannah gave my table excellent service while it was super busy. Thank you Hannah! We will be back!"}
{"text":"We got a complimentary cinnamon pancake. Holy crap! It had powdered sugar and candied pecans and a cinnamon butter. I don't understand how a pancake can change your life, but it has. Forever.

But wait. It gets better. Then what we actually ordered came! We got one order of Bella Bella Bennys and a Two Fer Bella and Chili Verde Benny. Holy moly!!! Whoa!!! The Bennys are out of this world! And everyone here talks about the hash browns. I wondered how good they could possibly be. They're all that and then some! New favorite place!! New favorite place!!! Hooray!!! I want to live here."}
{"text":"There was so much good stuff on the menu, we HAVE to come back! Best benny next to mine!!! French toast awesome... but a little sweet. Can't wait for tomorrow's breakfast!!!"}
{"text":"Spending the week at The Westin Kierland and decided to try Snooze for breakfast. It's  a clean and inviting restaurant tucked inside Kierland Commons. Indoor/outdoor seating with a friendly staff. Our server was pleasant and helpful in our entree choice. However, after quite some time and several coffee refills (from another server) later he asked us what we'd ordered. He returned and acknowledged he didn't put in the order. It still took some time for our breakfast to arrive. It was decent and he said he'd take care of it on the bill. We received the check and he took off a juice and a coffee. Pretty disappointing as that wasn't what he screwed up! No manager visited our table and we were there almost 2 hours!! Probably won't be returning."}
{"text":"We always come for the eggs Benedict .  Three different kinds of Benedict that we absolutely love.  The traditional,  the green chili and the prosciutto.  And if you want a fun breakfast cocktail this is the place.  The. Wait can be awhile on the weekends so I suggest going early or during the weekdays."}
{"text":"The food was delicious! I couldn't decide on what to order because everything looked good! The one complaint I have is that I couldn't find anyone (hostess, waiter/waitress, etc.) for a good 5-10 minutes when I walked in. I was so confused!"}
{"text":"Woke up this morning wanting something sweet. My husband and I came here for brunch and was surprised by the food. 

We got there and they were very busy. About every single table was taken. We waited for about 20-25 minutes, which was what we were told the wait would be. They take your phone number down and send you a text once your table is available. Snooze is located in a shopping area so you can choose to walk around before making your way back.  

We got seated and our waitress came by immediately. She took our drinks down and left the menu with us. I ordered the Mmm Mmm Mimosa, and my husband ordered the Bangkok Bloody Mary. Both were very good. The Bloody Mary tasted like chili sauce and reminded him of Asian food so he loved it. I also ordered their orange juice which was fresh squeezed and so good. 

I ordered the OMG! French Toast, which was BOMB.COM.  The portion was perfect, the amount of sweetness was just right.  Everything about it was just...so good. Yummy!  My husband ordered the Benny's Benedict...something along those lines. Came with salmon and poached eggs with hollandaise sauce. The eggs were poached to perfection. The sauce was divine. The hash browns were seasoned so well.  

All in all, it was worth the wait and we will miss it when we leave Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I was hesitant to try because I am just not that into breakfast places but turns out that the hype associated with this restaurant is well deserved! I had the E'lote eggs Benedict. Loved the quinoa corn cakes used in place of the traditional English muffin. Great flavors and not too rich...even for an eggs Benedict! I also had the Bangkok Bloody Mary which I wouldn't order again. It has fish sauce in it...was mild but still had a bit of an after taste. In Snooze's defense, the server offered to switch it out for me but I declined. All in all, great breakfast and worth the wait (about 25 minutes on Saturday around noon)."}
{"text":"Best breakfast spot there is. Snooze found the recipe for success and set the bar so high I can't go anywhere else for breakfast because nothing comes close. 

Food, service, promptness, and friendliness are all a 10. Austin is my go to guy but we had Melanie today and she's a rockstar too. Yet to have a bad experience here.

10 out of 10!"}
{"text":"Hands down best breakfast/brunch restaurant. You must get the cinnamon roll pancakes. To. Die. For!!!  The bloody Mary's are unique and tasty."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for Sunday brunch and it was a 30-45 minute wait for the two of us. The menu is pretty creative and we decided to share two dishes. We ordered the pancake flight with the sweet potato pancake, pumpkin pie pancake and the pancake of the day (tiramisu). I am a huge fan of tiramisu so I shouted yes before the server could finish describing it. We also ordered the breakfast pot pie, which was a large flaky puff pastry with pot pie filling on top. Since I like my eggs runny and my friend doesn't, we ordered the eggs on the side. 

The pancakes - My favorite would have to be the sweet potato pancakes. We were both disappointed by the tiramisu one... It was more like a chocolate chip pancake than anything else. The pumpkin pancake had some sort of filling in the middle and it was delightful.

The breakfast pot pie - While it was good, I probably won't order it again. I want to try some other things on the menu. I did order my boyfriend their pretzel breakfast sandwich and he said it was just okay. My friend ordered a salad to go and it looked great. Can't remember it at the moment but I would if I saw the menu.

Mimosas were yummy and decently priced. I will be back to give it another try!"}
{"text":"Ok. I am gluten free and Pancakes are on the top of my list of things I miss most. For the last 5ish years I have tried finding the perfect gluten free pancake... these are for sure it! The cinnamon roll pancakes. Oh my! If you are like me and also watching your sugar, be sure to ask for the syrup on the side.
Everyone in our group was really happy. You would NEVER know this place is a chain! Love it! 
The fan favorites:
The ben-y, the eggs Benedict with salmon and the blueberry lemon pancakes. 
I wish I remembered our waitresses name. She went out of her way to help us."}
{"text":"New to Arizona and first time trying out Snooze. I have had several locals recommend Snooze to me, so I thought I would try it out. I went on a Saturday morning and it was really packed. The wait was approximately 20-30mins. The staff was really kind and even remembered my name when they were about to sit us. 

The place was artfully designed with a hipster feel and the employees had a 80's/90's outfit theme. The booths that would normally sit 4 were blocked off to sit two. It seemed weird at first but we quickly got over it. 

Under the art of hollandaise section of the menu, it comes with two benedicts so you can customize it however you would like it. I had chosen the Chilaquiles Benedict (thin slices of prosciutto based) and Bella! Bella! Benedict (barbacoa beef based). The portions were respectable. No one left with food to take home nor did they explode from being so stuffed. Overall, a phenomenal experience and I'm already looking forward to my next meal there."}
{"text":"I'm in love. First time, had Eggs Benedicts. You can choose two, from a list of well-paired flavors, meats, sauces. With an Americano, it was excellent. Couldn't wait to go back, which I did just a few days later, and had the quinoa porridge. So good it brought tears to my eyes. Sweet maple syrup followed by the rich butter... Soaking into warm peaches... swimming in rich oats and quinoa. I can't wait for breakfast. I haven't tried it yet, but there is also a full bar and a great breakfat, brunch and lunch cocktail menu. Cocktails for breakfast."}
{"text":"4 stars for food including coffee. Knocked off a star for the service. The server (Amanda) rushed us to order even though she knew it was our first time and we were unfamiliar with the menu. She didn't tell us what the pancake of the day was and didn't know what it was when we asked. After we ordered, she ignored us for the remainder of the meal - we had to keep trying to flag someone down for simple requests like hot sauce, etc. She had a fake half-smile on her face with every interaction. If you don't feel like doing your job in a pleasant manner you probably shouldn't come to work."}
{"text":"Good food with a nice and open atmosphere. The flight of pancakes provide you with your choice of 3 different selections. The pineapple and blueberry were both delicious. The peach, not so much. Waited 30 minutes at 10:30 on a Monday. Can't imagine the wait on a weekend."}
{"text":"This place is the best breakfast spot I have ever been to. I have tried most of the items on the menu and have never been disappointed. 

Ask for Emma as you server.  Emma is not only efficient but such a sweetie that I will ask for her every time from now on."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and have always had a great meal.  My favorites are the unique pancakes!"}
{"text":"I don't like to complicate breakfast. I usually find eating 1000 calories worth of pancakes as my first meal is a waste, and a poor way to start the day. 

Snooze is the first and only place I will willingly and excitingly indulge in copious amounts of breakfast foods!

The last time I ventured here I tried the pancake of the day, it was a Blue Corn Batter with a Basil Mascarpone Cream and some sort of infused Syrup. It sounded weird. It was awesome! 

If you're interested in taking your breakfast to the next level, I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Too expensive and the wait is too long. The food is good, but definitely not worth it. The mimosas were too weak for the price. You're better off ordering an orange juice instead."}
{"text":"The French toast was good, I found it quite surprising it doesn't come with any side whatsoever, no hash browns or bacon. By the time you add those 2 items you're looking at $20 for French toast...they're a little too proud of their food."}
{"text":"Snooze is one our favorite breakfast go to spots!  The food and service are great.  We especially enjoy their unique and delicious pancakes.  The pineapple upside down and blueberry danish are AmaZIng!  We also love their breakfast burritos.  The staff is consistently on point,  will have to say Eric is our favorite server,  he is awesome.  Sometimes the wait is long,  but we've never regretted waiting."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and both visits have been amazing! The servers are very down to earth and so helpful! In addition, the food is so good! Both times I ate breakfast here our server brought us a free pineapple upside-down pancake as a treat!! Will be back for more!"}
{"text":"A gluten free foodie's paradise! I have celiac and they can accommodate everything except maybe 3-4 things in the menu to be gluten free. I did not really love the OMG French toast with gluten free bread, but the eggs Benedict and pancakes were great. Come during the week or get here early or late so you don't have to wait in insane lines!"}
{"text":"Wow great food and really good coffee and amazing pancakes upside down pinnacle one it's jus delicious"}
{"text":"The food is great. People are friendly.  Hippie staff.  I guess a little dirt don't hurt!"}
{"text":"Joe is flipping hilarious!!!  He is the best waiter I've had in FOREVER.  Quick wit and great humor to keep is laughing for days and super helpful with the menu.  He even suggested half and half orders when we couldn't decide!
Awesome decor throughout with bright colors and a nice patio.  Love the orange.  We had passed by on several mornings and it's literally always crowded for good reason.  The pancakes are a must have with all the fluffy goodness to indulge in.  They are pretty big portions so if you're not completely in the mood, a wise choice would be to get an order to share if you can.  Chiles verdes and chilaquiles were also yummy with the most amazing sauce.  Price point is perfect for the quality of food and exceptional service.  My only wish is to go back and try a mimosa!"}
{"text":"Pancake flight was amazing! We had blueberry, pineapple upside down and sweet potato. Simply delicious! Also had the Benedict duo.."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite breakfast spots! I can't say much about anything else on their menu since I get the same thing every time. Lol

I recommend getting the Chilaquiles Benedict and splitting it in half. Then order a pancake flight to share -- the sweet potato pancake is amazing. 

I'm not really a breakfast person but Snooze definitely always hits the spot -- it never disappoints!"}
{"text":"GO HERE!! Get the sweet potato pancakes! Even better, get a pancake flight so you can try a bunch! GET THE CHAI!! It's seriously the best in town, pretty sure it's actually made from tea! What a concept!!  Basically everything here is done so well, you really can't go wrong!! Snooze, you have a very special place in my heart~ love me some brunch!!"}
{"text":"With the excellent ambiance and great food there's no wonder why there's a long wait. I have only ordered take out because of this... but never the less, the food is GREAT! Not to mention the courteous customer service. The hostess are always in a pleasant mood!"}
{"text":"I've been to the Tempe location and was so happy to see a Snooze in North Scottsdale. I went this morning for a birthday brunch. We ordered the chiliquilles Benny and the pancake trio (pineapple, sweet potato and strawberry shortcake). When our waitress heard it was my birthday, she sent out a blueberry danish pancake with a candle. Delicious way to start our meal. The Benny and pancakes were very excellent. It was fun to try all of the toppings. The restaurant is loud in volume and color. I'm a big fan of the color orange, I like everything about the decor. It took 55 minutes to get a table, put you name of the list, grab a coffee at Starbucks and people watch until your table is ready. 

I should add, they try to buy local, nothing is frozen and there's no microwave on site. It's good food, cooked just for you!"}
{"text":"When you arrive on the weekend there is generally a 45 min wait. Is it worth it? I think so. I like the whole vibe from the decor to the music. 
Let's start with the drinks. I had a spicy bloody - loved the jalape√±o vodka in it! I also had a grapefruit concoction. Not sure of the name, but it was great!
The food: I had the Chile Verde benny. I liked it, not an all time fav, but still a solid choice. What I really loved was the sweet potato pancake! You could see actual sweet potato in it. My husband had a gluten free pancake with blueberries and he enjoyed it as well. My 6 yr old had the pumpkin pancake: we all decided it was way too sweet (that's coming from a 6 year old and a person who loves sweets!). It had cream cheese in it. It was just too much. If you are thinking about it - go straight for the sweet potato."}
{"text":"AMAZING breakfast. I usually get the eggs Benedict but switched it up and got the pancake flight with pumpkin, pineapple, and chocolate chip pancakes, which I highly recommend. I also recommend their mimosas. Very friendly staff & great service every time I come here. The long wait is always worth it!"}
{"text":"Excellent brunch - quick service even when busy! I opted for the OMG French Toast, which is the best French toast I've ever had. This place is a cozy, hip little eatery to grab brunch, breakfast, or just some coffee to go! I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Second visit to a Snooze establishment in three days. May be back tomorrow! Everything tastes amazing and is presented beautifully. Everyone who works here is friendly and cheerful. So nice to have a restaurant that does it right. 
Now if I can just get them to open one in Utah!"}
{"text":"Never had a a better breakfast experience in my life. Ordered a Benny combo and on the waitress suggestion substituted the sweet potato pancake for the hash browns. Both were absolutely amazing. I was completely stuffed but could not stop eating the GF pancake. It was incredible. Service was perfect and although the wait was a tad long it was well worth it! Wish we had one in the Lou!"}
{"text":"Great food great drinks. There are so many more cocktails I want to try. I had the egg sand which and it was amazing. They have an awesome menu and the vibe is perfect for brunch."}
{"text":"We had breakfast or lunch here twice b/c of the great food & delightful waitresses. They even have gluten-free pancakes which are really good! Absolutely delicious food, however it is loud & crowded & I would never eat inside b/c of the noise level. We ate outside under the patio heaters both times."}
{"text":"Decent brunch place. Meals are unique and staff is kind and helpful. Service is fast! A handful of fun menu items! Always packed and reservation wait. Wait is usually short."}
{"text":"Loved this place in Boulder last year, so excited to find it in Scottsdale!  Ate there pretty much 6/10 days of my recent vacation!  Food and service consistently superb!  Love the GF ability of all the pancakes and french toast options, plus the fact that you can order 2 different bennies- so you get to try  them all!   There is ALWAYS a line!!  Bring your cell phone and they will txt you when your table is ready!"}
{"text":"Pretty much my favorite breakfast restaurant I've ever had. We ordered the spud scramble and breakfast pot pie. Amazing!!! Wish there was one in our town."}
{"text":"Delicious food and a great atmosphere. The service is very friendly. The menu is a little more modern, but the food is great. A lot of healthy options. We decided to sit outside since it was a beautiful morning before the heat, and since we would be seated right away.

Our server kept checking on us and brought us refills regularly. I also watched her hustle and work hard taking care of all the tables on the patio. She was very knowledgeable about the menu and very sweet. I overheard her talking about vegan options with another customer, so either this restaurant is a popular option for eating vegan or she was very knowledgeable about the subject. 

Make sure you check out their mimosa list!"}
{"text":"I went to Snooze for breakfast on Tuesday, September 27 for breakfast and Sarah was our waitress. I have been to Snooze several times and keep going back because the food is always great -- try to breakfast tacos and get bacon and avocado on them! But what was extra exceptional was that Sarah was an awesome server! She made our morning mommy breakfast date a blast! She was energetic, fun and on top of things! I told my friends, \"I bet Sarah is going to bring me more water even though I didn't ask.\" Sure enough, two seconds later, SHE brought me water. That is the epitome of an excellent server! Great job Snooze for hiring amazing people because there are three things to make a great restaurant. Food, ambiance and your staff. Sometimes the food can be OK and ther ambiance can be mediocre, but if your staff sucks then the whole dining experience is a bust. Sarah was amazing! Thanks for making our breakfast great which then made our whole day great! We'll be back and be sure to ask for Sarah next time we're there too!"}
{"text":"Breakfast food was great, lots of choices for pancakes.  Blueberry pancakes were loaded with blueberries.  Very cute, fun decor.  Hannah was a fabulous waitress."}
{"text":"Great breakfasts served by a super friendly staff. My daughter and I both ordered egg dishes which were fabulous. The super friendly waitress was so pumped up on their pancakes of the day she brought us out one to try. A bit to sweet for my tasting but she gets an A++ for her enthusiasm and salesmanship. I look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"My second yelp for Snooze after more than a year of somewhat frequent visits.  The reason - Sarah.  The customer experience at Snooze has spoiled me as it is the norm and expected when we arrive.  A challenging task is raising the bar on that expectation and Sarah did just that.  A friendly welcome, engaging customers, and most of all a genuine interest in making sure we were taken care of.  Kudos to her and the rest of the staff....so glad you are a part of the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Definitely a must, but there is always a long wait. Food here is very different than most average breakfast places. I've never had a bad meal and it's worth the wait. I also love the retro style design."}
{"text":"I love the concept of Snooze. The pineapple upside down pancakes are amazing. However, the last few times I've gone there they have made my breakfast wrong. They seem to have an issue cooking eggs, omelettes, etc. I also noticed that the service is not what I would expect from a breakfast restaurant. You have to request a refill of coffee or water they don't walk around filling it up. It seems the servers huddle together in the corner instead of tending to customers. I do however hope that they get these issues handled as we like the atmosphere and the pancakes."}
{"text":"If you get here early the wait isn't too bad - but it's worth it if you do have to wait! The menu is so diverse and their morning adult beverages are incredible! It's really fun to come when the weather is nice so you can sit on the patio - bring your dog, it's pet friendly outside! They've got a couple games outside and the interior design is so happy and cheerful - it's just really fun to come here. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Have been in the past, but this time I was so disappointed. 

I would describe Snooze  as expensive average food.  Not worth all the hype

I ordered the OMG French toast   I am not a big eater by any means, but this meal left me hungry. I shared the eggs of my friend

The saddest sight are the potted hash browns. Hash browns should be crispy and have some crunch   Due to the depth of the hash browns they were soggy and lacked the crisp that make a good hash brown.   

It is extremely noisy and the servers are literally rushed off their feet."}
{"text":"Updating my previous review and adding another star. Great menu and great food. Only 4 stars because they charge if you want your coffee refilled. Prices are a bit on the high side."}
{"text":"This is great the customer service is amazing . I love it . The food was outstanding . It is a bit chilly but once they open the window it is nice I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness!  This food is orgasmic!!

This is our second visit to Snooze and it was just as wonderful experience as our first.  Danielle, our server from our first visit, had a pancake sent over to us as a thank you for making the long drive from Vail, AZ.  The staff is all quite welcoming and Lauren served to be an attentive and kind.  Th experience is worth the trip and the service is phenomenal!  Thanks for the cake Danielle!!  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Literally EVERYTHING about our experience here was amazing!    All 6 meals were out of this world and Lilah, our waitress was fabulous!    What an amazing experience!"}
{"text":"Happened upon this amazing breakfast place! Looks like it may always be busy but I sure understand why... The service was awesome, the food was superb and the drinks are perfect. Best bloody Mary I've had with no Tabasco taste just spicy perfection. The food was over the top. I had the regular eggs Benedict and added tomato. Their hollandaise sauce I'd like none I've ever tasted. My boyfriend had breakfast tacos that were also amazing. We had to sit on the patio because we didn't have the time to wait for a table and it was hot outside but doable because everything else was so great! A must go back!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were visiting from California and decided to come here first thing in the morning. Excellent customer service and even better food. What a great welcome into beautiful Arizona!"}
{"text":"I was so happy when they opened a location near me.  Yay, breakfast is my favorite meal of the day.  The place is smaller than the one in Town & Country, but if you go early the wait is almost none existent.  I have had several of their bennys, pancakes and mimosas.  I love that they let you choose half of a benny and half of a pancake order.  This last visit, I had the chilaquiles benny, my go to pancake, the sweet potato pancake and a pineapple mimosa.  My husband had the breakfast tacos. Most of their \"breakfast\" cocktails are great, but they are strong.   Such a delicious meal, can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"Super busy at 7:30 a.m. on a Saturday morning?    Incredibly loud noise level inside?    Mediocre omelet made with VERY small eggs? 
On the plus side, our waiter was great,  attentive, and made sure we had plenty of everything we needed.  My dining partner asked me the symbolism of the \"jacks\" around the logo.  I told her I wasn't sure if those were jacks or the mid century Jetson type stars.  Location is great, lots of parking, and it is really well designed inside.  Loved the waiters t shirts too."}
{"text":"Like Snooze A.M., but closer to home!

This is a cool breakfast spot - modern takes on all kinds of traditional items - 7 or 8 variations of Eggs Benedict (try the Chilaquiles!), trendy French Toast, sweet potato pancakes - what's not to love?  

We went on Sunday, right about noon.  \"Are you kidding?  It'll take an hour or two to get seated at a breakfast place at noon on Sunday!\" came the protests from the youngest...they said about 20 minutes, and we were seated in 15.

Cool retro-atomic themed interior, very pleasant servers, tasty options (including lots of Gluten-Free items) - give Snooze a try!!!  It's totally worth putting up with the Kierland parking situation."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place out! And they did not disappoint! I've tried to go here a few times but I'm always too hungry to wait. So my husband and I went after the rush Saturday afternoon. We got there right before 130 and got sat right away. I got the iced coffee (Kind of a waste of 3 dollars. Small glass, filled with mostly ice and very little coffee and no refills. Taste of the coffee was very good though.) and my husband got their Bloody Mary with the jalape√±o vodka! YUM!! I got the breakfast Hash with toast. It was nice and crunchy, perfect scrambled eggs, and the perfect amount of food! The home made jam for my bread was freaking addicting. I could have eaten it by itself for desert! My husband got the 2 ways Benedict. First was a smoked salmon and caper relish which was spot on. And second was a prosciutto, arugula Benedict that had a great flavor as well. Both with perfectly poached eggs and toast that did not get soggy under all that deliciousness! We will be back! Sooner than later!"}
{"text":"Other then 45 min wait the food was worth it. Wait staff was very courteous as well ....will definitely be in my rotation of breakfast spots on the weekends"}
{"text":"Snooze has an efficient waitlist system. Holly was our server. She was attentive, really sweet and patient. I had never been to a Snooze before, but I really enjoyed it. My food was delicious and the drinks were good. If I come back to Arizona, I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"I've always loved the food, but my god, Hannah is the best!   Never have I had a server who is so enthusiastic and personable.  I highly recommend asking for her when you stop by here!"}
{"text":"Delicious! You know you're in for a treat when the 3 hosts at the door not only all greet you but smile and make eye contact (so rare nowadays). The cherry pie beverage was sweet but not overly. I got the flight of pancakes: sweet potato, blueberry danish and the best...pineapple upside down."}
{"text":"There was about a 30-45 minute wait even on a Wednesday, which was expected since this place is so hyped up. My experience unfortunately was very underwhelming. The cappuccino and mocha were a solid 3 stars. I ordered the breakfast pot pie, so I was expecting something a bit more filling since we were coming for brunch. What came to the table would more accurately be described as puff pastry with gravy plus a strand of hair. The side of hash browns had parts that were burnt, so there's nothing really positive to say there."}
{"text":"The service was great, hostess and wait staff friendly- appeared happy to be working. The food was well prepared, tasty very filing. Natural fresh ingredients: house made chicken sausage, cage free eggs, house made hash browns. Pancake flight are too die for!! Simple delicious. I chose pineapple upside down cake, blueberry & peach cobbler. Definitely a must visit when your in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"First time going to Snooze. Had to wait almost an hour, Memorial day. Food was a little on the room temperature side but was good. Pancakes were good, eggs benedict was good especially their early harvest. There was 4 to our party so got to taste everyone's food. Would go again."}
{"text":"The upside down pancakes were absolutely delicious, as was the egg white frittata.  Our server, Hannah was absolutely amazing and took EXCELLENT care of us.  Hannah is extremely friendly, and helped us out, and was very knowledgeable...thank you Hannah for making this an awesome experience!!!"}
{"text":"One vegan option and it's not good - tasted artificial - look into tofu scramble or something other than the chia seed parfait."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Yes it is pricy and yes it's always packed but it's also worth it! The first time I went I had the trio pancakes, which were peanut butter and chocolate, as good as can be expected for someone who hates the taste of dark chocolate. I also had the strawberry pancake, which I don't remember much about, I'm sure it wasn't bad but not good enough to order again. Then I had the sweet potato pancake with ginger butter and candied pecans! Yasss! It was so good, I went back a few weeks later and ordered just that and it was amazing! So that's why I keep going back, so good, so perfect."}
{"text":"So I'm ignoring my husband's opinion, because sometimes he's stupid, and it usually is about food. I have been trying to come here for years! It seems like every time we are in town is either a two hour wait or we have something else to do. Finally, because we stayed just around the corner, I got my wish. 

Coffee. FANTASTIC hot, fresh, delicious

Service. It was busy but I don't feel we were neglected, however I did step out between ordering for a conference call and when I came back in food was just coming out. 

Food: ok so ordering was this girls worst nightmare. As a kid decisions were painful. I had to weigh all the odds and possibilities, because what of I never have this opportunity again. If I never ever make it back to Snooze what can't I live without? Thank God they have the pancake flight.  Umm yes. I'll have that with a side of hashbrowns. For my pancakes I ordered the blueberry Danish, pineapple upside cake and the new one something heaven maybe? It was quinoa and blueberry and strawberry with yogurt. I meant to get the sweet potato ones and immediately suffered ordering remorse and proceeded to stress about it through my meeting. 

The pancakes were awesome. Not too sweet, except the Danish was a little sweeter, but expected. Each was distinctly identifiable and when they brought them out they didn't touch and get each other's toppings on each other...maybe they knew I was ocd... I didn't expect more quantity our size wise but was hoping for slightly bigger ones just because I could justify out easier to my husband on the price. Either way, very satisfying. The hashbrowns were more like hashwhites. They come out in a stack and I actually for a brief moment thought it was rice. While the flavor and presentation was fabulous, I like crispy hash browns. Next time I'll skip those.

Ok so I.Will include my husband's thoughts because I guess they kinda matter. He won't be back. He got a Benedict with beef barbacoa and he didn't love it or even like it. Granted he could have just been being fickle since I picked the place and we had Just engaged in a small heated argument in which neither of us could just kick the other under the table like we secretly wanted to. I didn't get to sample his to confirm dislike but he's kinda picky so don't base a whole lot of stock in that. 

Overall. It's got a great expansive, innovative menu, which I love. It is a little pricier, but oh well."}
{"text":"Way over rated! Tasteless sausage, greasy poor quality corned beef hash, dirty unwashed berries."}
{"text":"The bacon here is cut thick and juicy, just the way I like it. I recommend the omelette. The breakfast burrito is huge. It could use a tad more flavor in my opinion, but it will fill just about anyone up. 

I was skeptical when the waitress told me that the orange juice is \"locally squeezed\". But I drank it like it was drugs, so whatever local squeezing is it seems to be working. 

The sweet potato pancakes are my favorite. I like the molten chocolate pancakes but they are so rich that after just a few bites I'm over it. 

The coffee was fantastic both times I went. I don't typically expect much from coffee at breakfast joints. 

I came here on recommendation from a friend. I'm glad I listened because Snooze is my new favorite breakfast restaurant in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This is a great breakfast place!  I like the breakfast tacos the most.  Everything seems very good.  Only issue, always a wait there.  You cannot make a reservation nor call ahead to be placed on the list.  So too many people standing around on the way.  Apparently the owner likes having all the crowds f people standing and waiting.  So I'm deducting a star."}
{"text":"I ordered the Sandwich I Am. The hash browns were delish, but I don't believe you can screw up a potato. The pretzel roll sounded better on the menu. It was crunchy, light, and way too buttery. I like dense, soft pretzel rolls. The egg looked like it had been microwaved at McDonald's, and the sausage patty was fine but nothing exciting.

It was fine, but if I returned, I would try the pancakes. And there's no way I would wait for a table like others did. I arrived early enough to be seated immediately, albeit outside."}
{"text":"Heaven on earth! Best eggs benny in town. We come to Snooze pretty much every week. Amazing food, the staff is super friendly. LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"Really wanted to give a great review of this place as I love the decor and the server couldn't have been nicer she was great! But the food first barley even warm I had the Ham Benedict and it was basically tasteless no flavor in the teaspoon of Hollindase sauce.Eggs were all cooked excellent  they have that going for them but that's were it ends. I give kudos to our server for bringing us out a pecan pancake on her to try. Husband had Ham and Eggs all cold he should have sent but he just went ahead and ate it."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Great atmosphere, great employees and the best breakfast around. I always make sure to get their brewmosa (blue moon and orange juice) and the chili verde benny. Hands down my favorite meal there!"}
{"text":"In town for a race this weekend and discovered this place through yelp. Staff was very friendly and attentive. The place seems busy on a regular basis, but there was no wait to be seated. Tables turned over quickly. 
I ordered the breakfast tacos, my girlfriend the breakfast burrito, and we shared the pancake of the day which was chocolate chip sweet potato with coconut and orange marscapone. 
Food and coffee satisfied our cravings. I did however, inquire about the female wait staff's uniform. All were wearing yoga pants, a  snooze t-shirt, one waitress was in uggs. Were they intentionally going for a casual morning look as if you just woke up? 
One of the staff told me that the yoga pants were about being comfortable. 
As a customer, I thought it brought the vibe down and it was hard to identify the staff if you needed something. 
The dining experience, for me, doesn't start and end with food and customer service. I think you can be casual, yet pulled together and professional. I think this place missed the mark in this area. 
Overall though, a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"The Eggs Benedict is really good, but if the wait is over 45 min don't worry about going here. I think it is overrated. 

There are plenty of breakfast that do brunch just as well. This place suffers from over hype."}
{"text":"This location is not as well functioning as the camelback location.
It always bothers me when a restaurant is not that busy and there seems to be enough servers but yet the coffee is not Hot and I ask for condiments and have to ask again and again.
All in all I am familiar with the menu the food was fine and the restaurant is cute and trendy but not a good experience at this particular location. 
I will think twice before going to this location again there are so many other amazing options in the area."}
{"text":"Home cooked food - delicious and large portions. Fresh juice. Good coffee. Cooked quickly. Outdoor seating. Crayons and coloring menu for the kids. Doesn't get better than this. We got here early. A line formed by the time we were leaving."}
{"text":"I'm updating my review after going back to Snooze several times, bumping up the number of stars. I wasn't going to ever go back initially, but someone from Snooze contacted me and offered me a chance to come back and try them again at no cost. I appreciated they did this and care about their reviews and reputation so I decided to go back.

I will say that the food is usually very good - every so often they miss the mark a bit but overall they are one of the better breakfast places around. 

My biggest disappointment still is their service. I tend to come in closer to closing time, mostly on weekends and sometimes during the week.  By then, most of the staff is either frantically cleaning already to prep for close or they are all sitting around eating. I don't feel I get the best service because of this approach and often it just creates a weird atmosphere I don't enjoy.

If they could work on this service aspect and maybe increase the size of the Scottsdale location to accommodate how busy they are - I could see this rating going up even more. Hint, hint...."}
{"text":"I ate here today with my husband while on vacation. We went to the hostess and was told it would be 15 minutes before she could set us. While waiting a waiter seated another couple that just walked  up. My husband wanted to leave and eat somewhere else but we stayed. What was surprising we never got an apology or told they were sorry about what happened. While we ate the manager walked by but never stopped. With all the choices around I will never stop here again as they don't care about their customers experience."}
{"text":"Second time I've been to this place and it's so much better. Love their pancakes and the food is cooked perfectly. Not much to complain about."}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time with my son. Outside of my bacon being overcooked, the food was great. You can tell the freshness and quality of the ingredients. The only complaint, outside of burnt bacon, the atmosphere is awkward. It seems to insist upon itself. There's too much of how great they are with locally sourced ingredients etc. I get it, you're proud, but don't shove it in my face. I'll still come back though."}
{"text":"Eat at Snooze Scottsdale for first time today. 
Was meet at front door by hostess. Started chatting while waiting for a table and told her this was our first time there. We ordered coffee and was greeted by an extremely friendly and courteous waitress who helped explain the menu to us. While deciding, Snooze sent over their signature pancake complimentary. I'm not a pancake person...but it was outstanding. We then split French toast which was very good. 
At 10AM the place was full indoors and outdoors.
The only downside of our morning was that we really didn't like the coffee. Hope it gets better as it is right next to Starbucks. 
Our food was so good I changed a luncheon meeting for tomorrow to Snooze. Can't wait to try their Cuban Sandwich as I've never had a good one in Phoenix. A very enjoyable experience. 

Need to put in shades or tint windows which are east facing. Had to get up and leave. It was really annoying early morning."}
{"text":"Wow! How do you pick a breakfast dish with so many fun and innovative choices?? Choosing between the sweet treats and the savory plates was quite a chore! In the end I ended up with a pancake flight and my husband chose the giant breakfast burrito with green chile sauce. That sauce was amazing! My pancake flight sent me straight into sugar coma but it was worth it! Donuts and coffee, pineapple upside down cake and blueberry Danish never made pancakes so good! They also have great am cocktails too! The bloody Mary's were delicious!"}
{"text":"Pancakes are delicious!!!! A couple of my friends got some omelets and they were cooked perfectly. The service is very nice our waiter took very good care of us. Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Snooze is our favorite breakfastspot when visiting Scottsdale. Love that they have one in Austin too! The breakfast cocktails have a clever twist and everything on the menu I've had is amazing from
the tacos, to the different Benny's. The kids options are amazing too. My daughter loved that hey came with hash browns. We're vegetarian and they have tofu and soyrizo options! Now if they would just open one in tucson!!! Casas adobes or la encantada maybe???"}
{"text":"Our server Lila was awesome and gave a great recommendation for the Spuds Breakfast. I'll definitely be back and hope to have her as our server again"}
{"text":"Great spuds, cheese, eggs and accoutrements. Tacos are excellent. Burrito looks amazing (I always get the tacos) and a healthy group of Benedict options. Oh, every pancake I have had is stellar. Get them all, start with the cinnamon roll pancake. For anything off the sweets menu Ask for sriracha to take it up a level."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot if you have a couple of hours. It's a very small space and everyone and their brother is trying to get in. With summer coming it will only get worse as the inside is quite small. It's very telling however because the food is yummy. Great spot once we were seated and got our food. Very strong coffee. Ask for some extra cream."}
{"text":"Im so sad to leave 3 stars on a Snooze as we go to one anytime we are near one. It's been 2 days in a row that we've visited different AZ locations. The food was fantastic,  as usual. Juans bfast tacos (add pulled pork) and huevos rancheros (with green chili) were both so fantastic. The reason for 3 stars is the service. From the seater to the server, both were pretty awful. We walked in and a server was standing, bent over,  his back turned to us talking with 2 other people and they didn't greet us for far too long, so it was a bit awkward to just stare at some guys bum. Then our server had ZERO personality. No smile or anything. I don't recommend this location,  especially for a first timer at Snooze. The Gilbert location is amazing and so is the Tempe! Much more fun and lively."}
{"text":"Favorite breakfast spot. They have a wide variety of gluten green options including pancakes. I always order multiple plates when I go because I love the food so much. The space is a little loud for me so I prefer eating outside but the food is worth it"}
{"text":"What a fresh, fun, new place. This amazing location, right next to the SBs at Kierland Mall, is perfect. The decor is retro 50's, but with great freshness. The little snowflake-like icon (it reminds me of bowling ball bags for some reason) runs through the place. The color palate is very cool. The furniture is very original with lots of little curved booths that make for cozy seating.

Food was quite good. Had the pineapple upside down cake pancakes. Stay away from the chicken sausage (bland and \"not\" chicken apple sausage, like I thought it was. Traded it for the traditional pork patty, which was better). It was chilly but the outdoor seating is super. Place is \"very\" noisy, but that's expected. Waitress and staff was very, very nice. They text you when your table is ready (tech-forward)."}
{"text":"Went there today and ordered eggs, hashed Browns and a gluten free pancake....... Egg and hashed Browns were good, but pancake was still runny and raw in the middle, so that sucked.....luckily I caught it before I ate any of it. Waitress didn't seem to concerned with it either, just stated, ok, I'll get it taken off the bill..... I would have gotten a new one, but it had already taken close to 30 minutes to get our food in the first place...... Patio is so packed with tables it's near to impossible to even move about it......it's such a small space compared to the one at camelback and 20th, and just as, if not more of a populated area. I'll go back again, but skip the pancakes next time.... It may have to do with the fact that it was gluten free.....maybe they cook different......"}
{"text":"A friend and I stopped in on a Sunday for brunch. I had the egg white scramble with tomatoes, spinach, onion, green peppers and avocado. It came with the most delicious hash browns and yummy thick toast. Their coffee was great, too. My friend had the Ham and Eggs Benedict and loved it! 

I've been to Snooze before and had the lemon ricotta pancakes and the stuffed French toast which are also delicious. 

The wait to be seated can be long but it is so worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Conveniently located in Scottsdale Kierland commons across the street from Scottdale Quarters, they opened a brunch joint Snooze. Loved this place so much in Denver,  we dined here twice during my 3-night stay and i was so excited to see Snooze while taking a saturday morning walk with my starbucks at Scottdale Quarters.  I didnt know they had opened one in Scottsdale. 

The place was not very crowded around 7 am on Saturday. Service was a bit on the slow side considering it wasn't that busy but the staff was friendly.  The food is very delicious and the atmosphere is open and inviting. 

I love brunch places in Scottsdale  (breakfast club, first watch, butters, over easy etc) and Snooze is a great addition to that list. Definitely worth checking it out. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were so impressed with this place! We ordered the breakfast pot pie, huevos rancheros, and the pancake flight with chocolate, sweet potato and pineapple upside down. The pancakes were DELICIOUS!! Beat I've ever had. But everything was great. The staff was super friendly and made us feel so welcome. Our server was Hannah, and she was such a delight! She was so nice, funny, had tons of energy and gave us great suggestions. You could tell she really cared about us as the customer. We will come here again!"}
{"text":"IF you snooze thru brekky , well there's always Snooze for brunch-y. I can't hit my snooze button on the weekends because I am excited for my Snooze experience ! Mimosas in many fresh squeezed fruity flavors for $6 ... yes, please! I'll have two! This particular Saturday with my friends, I was in the mood to try the fresh squeezed grapefruit Mimosa ... just enough tart to level out the sweet sparkling wine. Angelo was our waiter and we got the patio, luckily, to enjoy the beautiful Arizona spring like weather. We all shared a splurgey sweet, very dessert like pancake called the Pineapple Upside Down Cake... heaven upside down in my mouth is what this delight was! So sweet , with chunks of pineapple and sweet glaze on top ... no way could I have  eaten this as an entire meal.. OKAY, I could have, BUT I stopped myself from that sweetness overload. I went with the protein filled Huevos Rancheros, a favorite of mine with poached over easy eggs, perfectly placed over black beans and then over steamed, (not fried), tortillas; this recipe comes with three eggs to fill you up..some other places only give you two. I also substituted the usual sauce for the Ranchero Sauce, as I tend to like my sauces a little more on the green side. So good and filling! The pico de gallo is nice to top it all off. I am dying to try the Benny Duo one of these brunch filled days... Snooze is one of the only places I have been to that allows you to have a half order of one of their great unique , (or traditional), eggs benedicts and another half order of another when you want to try two of them! Sometimes its just so hard to decide on just one! Another thing to splurge and split , (or not!), is the OMG French Toast. This will knock your entire socks off.. or your workout clothes..or your pjs if you are still wearing them when you arrived at Snooze. I split this one day with my hubby and it reminded me of the stuffed french toast you can find down in New Orleans. Snooze takes thick, fat brioche bread and french toasts it all up; stuffs it with sweetened mascarpone cheese; tops this now amazing stuffed french toast with vanilla cream and caramel and THEN tops it off with fresh plump strawberries and toasted coconut... YES. YOU will say, \" OH EM GEE'. And then your eyes may pop out of your head because its so delish and heavenly. 
If all this is too much of a carb overload like it is for me, get one of their coffees. They make their java good and strong. 
Yes. Snooze has a wait. Every time I have been, I have waited at minimum thirty plus minutes. So what. Get on the list and go walk about Kierland and grab your coffee and stroll. Wouldn't you be doing that anyway? Stop complaining about the small things and enjoy your brunch once you have worked for it after you walked it off. Oh and bring the pooch. The patio is pup friendly. :-)"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum. Food, coffee, service all all a delight. The noise level not so much. It is LOUD hard to hold a conversation. They desperately need some sound absorbing surfaces. That being said as I sit in my home on a Sunday morning I wish I had my plate of food from snooze in front of my again."}
{"text":"Great food, good price. What more could you ask for. Would recommend 5/5 only hold back is the hours, I would easily go here at night."}
{"text":"Melanie was our waitress! She was fantastic! The food was amazing and we had excellent service!!! We will definitely be coming back!!! Ohh I had breakfast tacos and they were to die for!!! We also had pancakes! So good!!!"}
{"text":"I had great service here. I ordered a flight of pancakes and found out one of my choices had nuts (which I am allergic to). So I called back and they gave me the pancakes they had already prepared with my new pancakes. (So I got two pancake flights for the price of one)! They were delicious!"}
{"text":"Yay worth the wait! Love pancakes especially when they can be gluten free. Not only was the food outstanding but service great. Everyone was friendly and it was very obviously that they want you to have a good experience. Thank you."}
{"text":"Great food, tried the three egg scramble and the egg I am sandwich. You really can't go wrong with anything you order from them. P.S. - try the orange juice absolutely delicious. This place hits the spot every time."}
{"text":"Came into AZ for a few days, was told to try this place. WOW!! Great service and food!! We had the waitress suggest food for us. Pineapple upside down pancake and cinnamon bun pancake was like eating a dessert!  we also had breakfast pot pie and the Benny duo  (green chili and pulled pork) will be back to try different items off the menu."}
{"text":"Great food great service. This is my fav am diner in the valley. Everything on the menu is amazing and they have an all- star wait staff. If you are in town ask for Lilah's section she is the best of the best!!!"}
{"text":"Snooze cafe is an experience with good food added. Fun wait staff."}
{"text":"Wowww, this place has gone down hill. Both food and service. Everything feels rushed. They gave us a bill after we took two bites of our food. We weren't happy with one of the orders and told the waitress about it. Her response \"well you should have told me before I gave you the bill\". Ugh, well, if you didn't give us the bill after a few bites and if you came back to check on us before you gave us the bill, we could have told you. She then said with an unhappy tone \"now I will take it off the bill for you, okkk?\". We said \"no, it's fine\" and she was like \"okay\". She didn't apologize, didn't offer to make another one. She just went on without caring. I noticed that she told the manager because he looked at our table when they were talking. The manager didn't give a damn about it. Didn't come by to say anything to us at all. I feel like this place now, all they care about is to take your money then get you out of there as quick as possible so they can sit other people. They don't care about you or the food or anything else. Just MONEY!"}
{"text":"Always my Scottsdale go-to breakfast spot! The location is amazing. There's almost always going to be a wait when you go in so don't go if you're in a rush. The staff is always super friendly and attentive as they can be when its busy. The food is amazing and I love the morning cocktails they offer."}
{"text":"The decor is great really has that 1950's space age feel. Staff is super friendly, menu selections are great (something for everyone) and the food is hot/quick/delicious. I can imagine it is slamming on the weekends but for a Thursday at 11 I was seated immediately. They have a patio and dogs are allowed so I will be bringing my pooch along next time."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! I come in the morning, during the week day, if I have to drop my hubby off at work. That's when the wait is not an issue.  Otherwise you have to wait an hour plus, during the weekend days.  The pineapple pancakes are AMAZING!"}
{"text":"A great place for breakfast. We had the classic scramble and it came quickly and tasted fresh and hot. Great bacon! Service was great too!"}
{"text":"AWSOME place 
I think what's the best about them is the flavor food the food.i didn't know you can do that much from eggs 
Even make me want to open a restaurant 
Amber the server was very nice,she work very fast and even came to our table 5-6 times to make sure every thing is ok 
She took her time to talk to us about work and life even when she was extra busy 
I forgot something on the table and they team there went the extra mile to get back to me even when the already trash it 
I will go back there very nice place"}
{"text":"I had the three pancake meal and it was incredible! The penut butter pankakes were the best!"}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of breakfast foods, but I really enjoy Snooze! The food is great, the staff is friendly & the service is quick. You may have to wait for a table, but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Snooze is a family favorite. The food is always spot on. The only down side is the wait is entirely too long on Saturday/Sunday mornings, which the staff cannot change. Quick employees and amazing dishes. Love the futuristic designs inside!"}
{"text":"Lila has been my server at the bar the last three times I've gone to snooze.  She is so attentive, kind, happy, and professional.  She is the reason I keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Eat here! I just moved to the area and love breakfast, so we had to check this one out. The portions are perfect, so you won't leave feeling miserable. The benedicts and pancakes looked really yummy, but I went with corned beef hash. Yum! There is also a bar which made this place a priority over the other breakfast places in the area for us.  Worth the wait-oh yeah-there is a significant wait considering it's a Saturday morning, but they'll text you so you can walk around the area or whatever. Try it!"}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was amazing and staff (particularly Austin) was friendly and accommodating. 

Ordered the OMG! French Toast, the orange juice, and the tacos. Really light but filling. Ingredients were fresh."}
{"text":"From the moment you walk in you can tell this place is a great find. It is such a great atmosphere and everyone was friendly. If you have never been there before your waiter or waitress can give you a sample of their pancakes with what they call their \"pancake flight\" at no charge. Let me just say that these pancakes are amazing!! I ended up getting the flight myself and I was not disappointed. The pancakes were filled with lots of deliciousness yet still had the pancake taste to them. The Pineapple upside down pancake and the Drunkin Punk'n pancakes were just two of our favorites. Another plus was their full bar! Delicious drinks to accompany your meal. Overall this place was amazing and I will definitely come back when I am in town."}
{"text":"Wow what a great breakfast place. The flavors are so good here. My wife and I came after she visited here a few days ago with a friend. She was raving about the eggs bennies. I had the breakfast savory pie which really was amazing. A wonderful scratch make Rosemary gravely over a puff pastry square with my choose of egg which was sunny side up. Wow such a great dish. Creamy savory yummy. I also had a side of bacon. It was just like I like bacon i.e. Not hard and not crispy. It was thick and had a great flavor. My wife had benie duo which had a combo of the traditional eggs Bennie and the Italian eggs Bennie. I tried it and such a wonderful combo. To round out our meal I had iced tea which was very good and brewed, not from a concentrate, and my wife had coffee which she said was just \"ok\". Prices as very reasonable for this area of Scottsdale. The service was excellent and efficient. Despite being the day after thanksgiving we had our food in under 10 minutes. We will most certainly be back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Easy to find, parking is easy, lots of seating options. You can tell a lot of thought and effort went into the design and execution of it, and the result is that rare combination of pleasant background noise without feeling cramped or squeezed in next to another table. The staff are extremely friendly and give the whole atmosphere a great vibe. All this wouldn't matter much if the food wasn't good, but the food is the best part. The breakfast burrito with bacon added inside is hard to beat, but you can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  glad we found this place!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Az food good but there staff is amazing nice to have friendly people that care about your needs Hats off to are terrific server Hanna .. Would she like to move to California and be a front of the house manger .. That's how engaging she was.

Thank you 

Coconuts fish cafe awaits you"}
{"text":"Colorado based company that gets so busy in Scottsdale when the snowbirds are here that it gets competitive for a seat. You simply can not get this busy serving mundane food."}
{"text":"The food is really good!! The design of the eatery is very modern. My only complaint is that it is always very crowded and extremely loud inside."}
{"text":"Best breakfast place! So good. Service is great, happy and friendly. Food is on the spot. Coffee is delicious. Amazing!"}
{"text":"We love this place. Too many great entrees to list. Oh wait that's called the menu.

Committed to new dish each visit. Today was The Lower East Sider. Perfectly smoked salmon lox. The herbed goat cheese was so tasty and spreadable. Toast was just right. Excellent service every time."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in the greater Phoenix Metro area.  Food is fantastic, waitstaff is amazing.  I had the Bene Combo:  Benny Goodman and Winter Harvest.  The lox/cream cheese was fresh and delicious.  The veggie mix and roasted red pepper grit cake on the winter harvest was sooooooo good.    Love this place (even better than the Tempe location)!"}
{"text":"Number is disconnected and so i call another location but they don't know numbers to the other locations. I asked if the scottsdale location is still open and told it is. I was calling to place an order for my office and now I get to show up to work with no food."}
{"text":"Love this place, there is always a really long wait but it seems like they always quote way higher than it actually takes. The ambiance is awesome, wait staff is always super friendly and they always look like they're having a good time working. Food has always been consistent. It is definitely one of my favorite brunch spots. 

Tip: If you have some shopping to do in the quarter or kierland, put your name on the list and then do your errands. I usually go there first and do that, then walk over to starbucks and get my coffee. We've usually gotten a 60-ish min quote but it's always been closer to 30."}
{"text":"Hands down probably my favorite AZ breakfast locale! The breakfast tacos & breakfast pot pie are wonderful!!  They are even pet friendly on the patio which is awesome."}
{"text":"While we were in Scottsdale my husband and i decided to stop by Snooze and grab brunch. The atmosphere was great and the food was even better. We plan on making trips up to Snooze more often, just be prepared for a little bit of a wait. Luckily the location is directly in the middle of a shopping center!"}
{"text":"Was super excited about this place and was a short walk from where we were staying. Unfortunately, the kitchen did not understand what using a whole egg meant and had to apparently remake my order. We waited for about 45 minutes for our food while everyone that was seated after us got their food and ate it. What was supposed to be a relaxing morning breakfast turned into frustration."}
{"text":"We love this place for breakfast! My favorite is the tofu scramble with spinach, soyrizo, tomatoes and jalape√±os.  Best place for a delicious vegan breakfast.  The staff is always friendly.  It can be very busy as it is popular so sometimes you just have to relax and enjoy a leisurely breakfast.  Food comes out fast and hot!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic! I really need to get better with names because we were taken excellent care of at our breakfast date! Bestie and I were starving! After finishing off what we ordered, we ordered another round! Honestly, I'm lucky she's the voice of reason because I DEFIANTLY would have and could have had another round! It was just THAT GOOD! I ordered a spilt benny, 1/2 green chili 1/2 salmon lox. BOMB. Then the next round we got the cinnamon roll pancake... just stop reading and go immediately."}
{"text":"If you're looking for crazy food, like stuff you probably wouldn't make at home. This is the place. Pricey, but that's the average for N. Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Heard a lot about this place so decided to finally go today. I'll have to say, the food is good but they'd definitely need to pay more attention to what's going on in the kitchen. Took them 30 minutes to get us a table which was okay, but then over an HOUR to bring the food over and this is an hour AFTER they took our order! And here's the worst part, the food was COLD! As in put your finger in it and it's cold! Clearly sat there for a good 15-20 minutes and no one paid any attention to it. Hope they fix this problem because we overheard other tables were asking for the manager's name as well. With better management and service the place has potential."}
{"text":"This place was spectacular. Well worth the 45min wait on a Sunday morning. We went and did some nearby shopping and they texted us when our table was ready. Katie the GM was incredibly nice and was very involved with expediting seating and greeting guests. Our waitress Leeah was phenomenal. We will definitely be visiting this awesome eatery again. I had the OMG French toast and my wife had the corn beef hash, very very good."}
{"text":"Update- another fantastic breakfast at My Favorite Breakfast Place!! I love the corned beef hash, and the breakfast pot pie!! My daughter came to town so of course I had to bring her to my Spot for Breakfast! The Mimosas are always delicious and the service is always attentive! This time our server knew we couldn't make up our minds and we wanted to try the upside down pancake...she brought us one to share!! Super sweet!! Thanks Snooze for your Fantastic Start to My Mornings!! 


Another Fantastic Champagne Brunch at Snooze! I have to admit I don't like going to the Same Place a lot! Hey I'm Elite,it's my Duty to try new places but Snooze makes me break my own rules! Why? Because it's Amazingly Consistently Fabulous!! Service always Rocks even though they are Always busy!!!! This time Lila took Fabulous care of us even treating us to a pancake!!Always busy cause the Food Is Delicious & Different! Breakfast pot pie? Upside down pineapple pancakes? Who thinks this stuff up?? Snooze does!! Mimosas are always on point!! Tell them Jacque sent you!! Yes! I think they Know me there by now!! Bless you Snooze for rewarding me for bending my own rules!! I can't help myself...if loving Snooze is Wrong...I don't wanna be Right!!"}
{"text":"The service is excellent, and the food is heavenly (OMG Freanch Toast ) Angelo was our waiter and was awesome !! Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"I would love to start this off by writing about the gorgeous bacon... but first I need to rave about Sarah and Rob! They just stepped up my brunch experience to the max!! So friendly, funny, kind and on the ball. Never missed a beat and made me wanting to come back asap! Home run for snooze for hiring two rockstars.. oh and the bacon is amazing!!!!!"}
{"text":"Thought the wait had to do with the quality...maybe it's just that there aren't many options near here and you have a captive high dollar customer base.  They do offer free small cups of coffee while you wait but we've never seen the sign because the manager stands in front of it most of the morning.  After being seated near the sign and finally seeing it, I grabbed two small cups to sample the house coffee that they market on each table.  Yes, it's \"while you wait\" but since we always had to wait and never have been told about the coffee or have seen the sign, we tried it.  Well, the manager wasn't happy and the server mentioned that we could \"buy\" some coffee instead..and this was after we ordered some juice, so I would hope that he knew we weren't there for free coffee.  Not the biggest issue in the world but they could have handled it better.  I even mentioned it to the manager as we walked out and he seemed to have zero concern.  Wish we could continue to support this business, but a small little misunderstanding and the way it was addressed really left a sour taste as did their lack of response to a private email regarding the incident."}
{"text":"We had passed Snooze numerous times over the years we've lived in Scottsdale, and each time it was packed with people but we never stopped in. 

This Memorial Day weekend, we were looking for a new breakfast place on Yelp. Snooze and the menu choices looked really good! There was a 45-minute wait but since it's located in Kierland, we walked around and did some shopping. The 45-minutes went by quickly, as we received the text saying our table was ready!

From the time we sat down at our table, until we left, our experience was 5-stars! We struck up a conversation with the people sitting at the next table, and got some suggestions. The main one was \"the hash browns are the best!\" They also told us they eat there everyday! 

The wait staff couldn't be more accommodating! As busy as they were, the waitress sat down and answered our questions, and took our order. The drinks came quickly, as did the food! The food was cooked to perfection and served hot! It was as good as it looked! Five stars all the way!

(Oh, by the way, Snooze was so good that we went there the next day, had an even longer wait, and it was every bit as good as the day before! We both ordered different items and the food was equally as great as the day before!)"}
{"text":"This is by far my FAVORITE breakfast in the planet. No matter what you get you can't go wrong. The staff is beyond bubbly and friendly! My favorite dish is the OMG French toast and the flat and crispy hash browns. They are always so consistent with everything they do! This place deserves more than 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Ate at Snooze for the first time today and it was pretty great. The wait was about an hour and the place was pretty crowded, but the service was good and the food was worth it. We got the corn beef hash, egg's benedict and the pancake flight (blueberry, sweet potato and pancake of the day). I'm not a benedict person, so I'm not the one to ask about it but the corn beef hash with toast was the best hash I've ever eaten. It's savory, has a ton of meat in it and perfectly offsets the decadent pancakes. 

I wasn't expecting the sweet potato pancakes to be great, and in general I'm not a fan of blueberry pancakes, but they were both surprisingly good. The sweet potato pancakes have more of a subtle sweetness and almost takes like maple syrup or brown sugar, but the blueberry pancakes were really sweet and my least favorite of the bunch. The pancake of the day was really special. It was a buttermilk pancake with candied fruit and cranberries on the top. All of them were light and fluffy. 

Portions are big and good for sharing. If you're not a fan of lots of noise, then I would recommend sitting outside. The patio area is much quieter. It's also dog friendly and has huge umbrellas. If you're in the area, it's worth checking out Snooze."}
{"text":"I have been to Snooze locations across the southwest, and this location did not disappoint. Food always is of the same high quality, and staff are always so friendly. Especially if it is your first time, do not miss out on Juans Breakfast Tacos!!"}
{"text":"9/13/17 Update:

So I was pleasantly surprised when I was contacted by Snooze in response to my Yelp review and offered a $20 gift card to try Snooze again. Props to the marketing team/management. However, I can't change my rating from 2 stars. Was seated at 11:50 on a Wednesday (not busy), waited until 12:04 to have the waitress come by to ask if we wanted something to drink. Then waited another 13 minutes until she came back with our coffees and waters. Overall, she was more attentive than the last waitress but still pretty underwhelmed. In addition, we had two older ladies lunching next to us and they were seated right behind a place where the staff were putting silverware into bins. \"Putting\" is a nice way to say this, they were throwing the silverware in and it was making a lot of noise. Not enough to bother my party but enough to bother the lunching ladies. One of the ladies brought this to the attention of the wait staff and her response was \"this is something we have to do before we can leave from our shift.\" Of course, this response did not fly with the ladies and they asked to speak with the manager. A gentleman came over and apparently they knew him and he apologized but I didn't see him speak to the wait staff who made this comment. I don't know, there are sooo many delicious breakfast places in Scottsdale/Phoenix that I don't see the point in wasting my time or money with these types of shenanigans. 

Came here for breakfast, normally the food is pretty good but today the food was impacted by the poor customer service. Had to wait until our food came to have the waitress come back so we could ask for waters. The wait for food was also way longer than it has been in the past. Right now, I have been waiting for at least 10 minutes for my plate to be cleared, not to mention that the waitress never checked back in to ask if everything was okay. If she had asked I would have said that the chicken sausage was way too salty and that the toast was super cold. Not coming back to this location."}
{"text":"It was Father's Day and it was already 100 degrees.  The wait was 75 minutes and they stand firm to their policy of not allowing you to put in your name unless you are standing there in front of them.  It took about 5-10 minutes just to get through the line to get to the front and give them our name.  At 10 am in the morning on a Sunday, Kierland is pretty much deserted save for the Starbucks next door which is filled with people both waiting for their tables next door and people stopping in to get their morning lattes.
But at least it is air conditioned.

We were seated within the 75 minute time frame they quoted and made sure to have our orders ready as soon as the waitress came by to get our drink order (poor thing didn't even have a voice!).  Needless to say, it was a bit busy.

From the time we sat down (at about 11am) til we had gotten our food and were done eating was only 45 minutes so the kitchen was hopping and the food was delicious.

OMG French Toast was absolutely amazing.  I just barely stopped short of licking the plate clean with the vanilla creme mixed in with the maple syrup.

The hubby's half and half eggs benedict was delightful, one flavor clearly outshining the other but the delightful fact that you can try different flavors on one plate really appealed to him.

My father's breakfast pot pie was so impressive, he talked about it the entire time he devoured it.  Surprised at how uniquely presented it was, made out of a puff pastry with the egg on top.

This will definitely be a place to return to in the near future, honestly as often as possible.  Hopefully the wait time is a bit less on normal weekends, but knowing how delicious it is, I may determine it is worth the wait."}
{"text":"A nice place for breakfast.  They have some interesting variants on Eggs Benedict, which you can even mix and match.  My only complaint is that it can be incredibly busy on the weekends, so I would recommend getting there early if you don't want to wait."}
{"text":"Ok...this place was all it was cracked up to be.  We had come on Sunday for brunch and the wait was too long so we went elsewhere.  But came on a Wednesday and were seated immediately. The staff was all extremely nice and funny.  I ordered the eggs Benedict III.  Perfect poached eggs and crispy hash browns. All done to perfection.   My wife ordered the take flight with upside down pancake..my bite was awesome! The Mexican hot coco pancake..Devine! Toasted marshmallow and hot chocolate  drizzle. Wow! And the French toast that I didn't even get a taste of :). Great food fun atmosphere.   Loved it!"}
{"text":"Breakfast was fun & trendy. Lindsey was an excellent server. We had a Duo Benny- a classic style bene & the pork chili verde bene- both were great! We shared some Neat French toast with real maple syrup & a nice chicken sausage patty. Everything was very tasty. Thanks for the fun dining experience."}
{"text":"Thanks to Jessica I finally got to EAT here rather than just view the food on Facebook. Everything was made to perfection from the corn cake to the poached egg and gluten free pancakes. Simply delicious!!!"}
{"text":"My friends and I like to go try different breakfast places all over the valley and have been hearing about Snooze in a Foodies of Phoenix FB group. We decided to make the trek out of our North Phoenix/Anthem bubble to Scottsdale this morning and try it out. 

This place has a fun, funky, energetic vibe. They had tables, booths and outside seating available this morning and we sat in a round booth. Our waitress was super friendly and sweet. She noticed my Seahawks jacket and she was from Washington too and gave us some great recommendations on what to get. 

The thing about the Snooze
menu is that it's very flexible. If you can't decide on just one thing, or a couple things are looking good, you can half of one thing and half of another in the same order! This was great for us, being our first time there. They also had pancake flights with three different amazing pancake/french toast flavors! The OMG french toast deserved it's name for sure. It was sweet and fluffy with the perfect crunch, topped with strawberries. The pineapple upside down pancake was like a little slice of Hawaii on the plate! The cinnamon pancake had bacon on top and it was really yummy. 
Lots of different eggs Benedict options, healthy eating and gluten/dairy/vegan options available also. Coffee was smooth and they have a good selection of different coffee drinks. I was sticking to coffee as we went at 8am and my kids had been up since well before 6am but if you like a little booze with your breakfast, they had a long list of morning cocktails.

They served hash browns with the BEAT sandwich I ordered and those were super tasty and complimented the food perfectly. 

The prices were reasonable (especially for Scottsdale) and the service from everyone made it an overall pleasant experience. 

We will for sure be back as there is still so much in the menu to try!!"}
{"text":"The best brunch place Ev-ah!! Gluten free upside down pineapple pancakes, yes please! Great bennys GF and regular. Lovely morning cocktails. You simply must eat here!!"}
{"text":"My new go-to for coffee and breakfast or brunch. I ordered the Benedict with salmon and was blown away! On this occasion I brought my grandfather for his birthday and a waitress approached us to offer us a pancake that was made by accident. She didn't know it was his birthday but it was super nice. Of course we tried it and it definitely made his morning. It was the bacon caramel by the way (holy crap.) As for my coffee, I ordered a cortado- which is so hard to find- and it was awesome."}
{"text":"Love this place!!  The food is fantastic. Service is always great. The Benny's are our fave. And the pancakes!!!"}
{"text":"Out of Hash Browns!!!! How does a breakfast place with almost every dish coming with hash browns run out???? Waited for 45 minutes to get a table. Ordered and received our drinks and upon ordering food being told they had no hash browns.  Had they told us before we sat waited 45 minutes and then sat down we could have gone to a different place to eat! So not cool!!!"}
{"text":"I wish I lived in Scottsdale so I could eat here every weekend. Can't decide which eggs benny to get? No problem! Get the duo and make all of your indecisive dreams come true. Good food, good service and yum yum in my tum tum."}
{"text":"We wanted a local brunch place since we were in town visiting. This place looked great based on the menu. We got there around 830 or 9 on a Saturday, with a party of 8. There was a 30 minute wait and it was completely worth it. 

We got a few different items being a table of 8 and everything we got was perfect. There was a confusion about something and the restaurant brought a sample plate of pancakes and waffles.  The place was crowed but completely worth it if you are traveling to Phoenix.

I would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"Christ  was so polite and kind server. And the food all ways the Ono. That means delicious! My favorite Breakfast place!! The wait time was not even long."}
{"text":"Great location, super busy, innovative selection of breakfast entrees, amazing variations on the traditional eggs Benedict.
I'd give this place 5 stars if it weren't for two things - my eggs Benedict (actually a combo of the chilaquile and the green chili) came out cold, not even room temp. The marvelous layered corn masa replacement for an English muffin was downright chilly. The eggs were room temp, but done perfectly. I'm not sure why, maybe it's overloaded servers and the food sits in the kitchen waiting. Maybe it's that the underlying tortilla is supposed to be cold. Maybe it's the excellent pico de Gallo is cold (as it should be, for good sanitary reasons). Even the wonderful pork and beef under the eggs was room temp. Only the hash brown cake was warm and nicely skillet browned, suggesting that it was indeed cooked at the moment. The only thing that was hot as it should be was the house blend coffee, which was great, and it was served with real cream or at least half and half. But there, trying to get a refill seemed a bit challenging, but it happened.
The food was perfectly seasoned, I'd thought maybe it would need some Cholula or something, but no, it was savory and very nice, just cold, if it were warm, I'm sure it'd be even better!!!
This place could be awesome if they'd work on improving the food delivery and making sure that things that should be hot are so when they get to the table. As well, I'd be concerned about food safety if this happens regularly. 
I would like to say I'll be back, but next time I'll stress that I want the food hot."}
{"text":"A habitual bruncher, I've had my fair share of mimosas and fancy pancakes. Snooze Kierland knows what they're doing. Mmmmmimosa, 2 Breakfast Tacos with strip bacon, and a pineapple upside down pancake for the table please. I love that you can customize their menu. Hungry? Order the pancake sampler, toss back a few more
Mmmmmimosas, and thank me later. Fun music. Great environment. Bring the fam."}
{"text":"Weakest mimosa west of the Mississippi! Nothing worse than starting off your brunch with a mediocre drink. OJ to champagne ratio was one to be embarrassed of. Food was nothing to write home about. Stay away from the burrito unless you enjoy 3 lbs of chili sauce and a stale tortilla. The upside: quick service, friendly staff. The truth hurts..ya snooze ya lose (get it)"}
{"text":"Fantastic!  Our waiter, Austin, recommended the corn beef hash and I loved it!  Try the upside down pineapple pancake too! Been here multiple times and always good :)"}
{"text":"We had a great breakfast. Loved the burrito with the ranchero sauce! We really liked the bar seating and the beers on draft."}
{"text":"Hankering for brunchy, breakfast food yesterday for lunch so hubby and I hit up Snooze on a Tuesday around noon. The atmosphere, decor and pricepoint of Snooze is well suited for Kierland Commons. There was no wait and we were quickly able to be seated at an outdoor table. Our server Sarah took our order. Between my husband and I, we ordered a Benny and a 3 egg omelet. The meal was nicely presented and we got our order in under 10 minutes. Though it was good, I wouldn't have considered the meal memorable or outstanding in any way since it's hard to mess up over easy eggs or toast. I had a little serving cup on my plate that had a very tiny amount of jam (barely enough to spread on one half of my toast) so that was a little annoying. I didn't even want to bother with asking for butter to spread on my toast since it seemed like they were being flaky with giving out anything to accompany my toast. The service Sarah provided was sufficient, but she seemed pretty flat especially after we both only ordered ice waters with our meal. Hubby and I usually do not not normally cheap out on skipping on a usual soda, juice or tea, but we just weren't feeling it yesterday. Our bill including tip was under $30 since we did not order coffee or a fun drink. I'm sure this place is packed on weekends. Though it was nice to try this place out, we will likely not come back unless we have guests in town visiting us. Would I ever wait more than 30 minutes for awesome breakfast? If it's Hash House a Go Go, yes.....but for Snooze, no way."}
{"text":"Not only is the food over the top, the STAFF are all incredible. Its the BEST breakfast ,lunch in town. Hats off to Ms Ivy at the door with her infectious smile and the way she makes every guest want to return. Danielle is over the top with every guest she and Amanda as well take care of us. Take the time, ITS WORTH THE WAIt
This isn't just about the food its about the relationship of the entire staff and management!"}
{"text":"We came right when the restaurant opened and were seated right away. You could tell they weren't exactly ready for us but we were very early and we didn't want to come too late and wait in line. First the service was good. The server came by often, was friendly and got the order right. The food was made the way we liked for the most part. The sausage patty was just ok and the omelet was a little to oily for my liking but the ingredients were quality especially for the price range. I would come here again for the quality food and ask for less oil in my omelette and no butter on my toast :) 

Bottom line...this place is in an easy to find location and lots of parking early in the morning but I can't see that being a challenge in the day. The service is great! The value for the money is definitely perfect here. 

Pros
Good healthy food options 
Good service 
Good location 
Good value food for the money 

Cons 
Consider adding healthy green smoothies to the menu 
Consider less oil of the egg white omelet since this probably someone wanting I eat healthy 
Less butter on the toast"}
{"text":"The food is always of very high quality and delivering great service is always a top priority here.   By far my favorite breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"Sat at the counter. Service was very slow even though there were several servers working behind the bar. There are almost NO vegan options. I could only find fruit and hash browns. Not really breakfast, but I was desperate. I was really hoping for a delicious bowl of oatmeal, a great vegan go-to! I would not return."}
{"text":"Awesome vibe, great service, food is really good!
This place is worth checking out, I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome good, fresh coffee and great staff!  Very interesting pancakes that were all unique and tasty.  I would go back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Food isn't too bad, coffee is really good. The place is too loud, & there are sooooo many people running around, it's maddening. Don't go if you want to relax, or have a conversation."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed brunch here! The food was great but the wait time was pretty long. I recommend the pancakes and hashbrowns- soooo yummy! If you are in the area- head to Snooze just be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"If you want a hip breakfast place that the food is amazing, this is your place. Great food. Great atmosphere. Highly recommend this place for a date, family, or anything!"}
{"text":"Food never disappoints but the hostesses have a hard time managing the long lines that are always out the door. A lot of people love this place but their hostess system seams a bit flawed. But omg those breakfast tacos are to die for!!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and food. Love the different ways to build your dish by adding what you like. It was priced right for the food quality and portions. I would have given them 5 stars but the service was slow and the waitress didn't act as if she wanted to be there. We waited 10 min before I had to ask for our server so we could get water and coffee. It would make sense if they were real busy but the place was full but not packed. Hopefully she had a bad morning. Will try back and if the service is better, I will change my rating. Oh and I wished they had fresh squeezed juices."}
{"text":"Amazing as always! Cinnamon roll pancakes, sweet potato pancakes and pumpkin pancakes are all so good. I always get the breakfast tacos with 1 of the pancakes above!"}
{"text":"Great place. Really crowded during breakfast times. Expect a wait of around 40 min on weekends. Love the food and the fresh fruit juice."}
{"text":"This is absolutely my favorite breakfast place!!! Their pancakes are delicious and unique, with many different flavors and toppings. Their blueberry pancakes are the best!! Their breakfast sandwiches are also pretty good. It is a little bit pricey, but it is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Just trying different spots while in town for a few days.  Snooze was conveniently located, so we dropped in for breakfast.  The sausage gravy over puff pastry crust was a good change up from standard biscuits.  A single breakfast taco was enjoyed and filling for my companion.  Good service and reasonable prices for Scottsdale.  I will likely return."}
{"text":"went to this place on black friday pretty crowded but it was good service and the food was pretty decent i'll say that there pancakes were pretty good the french toast was a little over cooked tho so it was eh i'd come back maybe just not on a popular day"}
{"text":"Five stars for service and ambiance, three for the food. I settled for four stars! Came here on a busy Saturday morning and expected a long wait. Luckily they said only a 15-20 min wait, but it only ended up being 10 minutes! I like how they text you when a table opens up, better than having to carry one of those buzzers around and worrying about not going too far. Also I love how it looks, cups are cute, the logo is cute haha.
We ordered pretty much right away. I got Huevos rancheros with corn tortillas, and with arugula instead of cheese. My sister got a sandwich, I don't remember what it was called but it had eggs, pretzel bun, cheese, and she substituted the sausage patty for bacon. Was brought out pretty quickly! I was impressed by that. One complaint though was that the table next to us was so close to us it was almost uncomfortable haha. But I understand why, lots of customers calls for lots of tables. 
My sister loved her sandwich and hash browns, but I wasn't as into my meal. I just thought it needed more salsa, and would've preferred whole black beans instead or refried ones. Just too much mushiness for my liking, and I don't think the cheese would've made it better. I'm glad I got it with the arugula though, added a good flavor! Also I had some of my sister's hash browns and it tasted good with that. Would have preferred crispier hash browns though. Oh, and food presentation was amazing which wins points with me. 
I thought it was pretty reasonable price wise, average breakfast joint pricing. Also this would be such a fun place to take kids if you have a family. They had a guy there making balloon creations! One of the ladies working there was dressed as a pirate, totally a fun atmosphere and everyone working there seemed super awesome. The alcoholic beverages sound amazing..I have to come back for that!"}
{"text":"Came with a party of 4 for breakfast. Very cool vibe inside and nice outdoor seating if it's not too hot out yet. I ordered an egg white scramble. Would have liked more choices to add in, but went with chicken sausage and it was decent. Kids got French toast and pancakes. They give it 5 Stars. The French toast looked very good. Last meal was the Rueben. The pretzel roll was awesome. Service was average. I had to ask for refills multiple times and a couple other things. Overall, very good. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! There are so many things to choose from on the menu, including vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Thursday morning, 10:30 AM, was our third visit to Snooze.  There was a wait of about 10 minutes, no big deal, but once seated we waited a full 15 minutes for a waitstaff to acknowledge us.  Finally, food and drinks ordered, served, and that was it.  Not a single person came to refill beverages (coffee and soda), offer jam, ketchup, Tabasco...all of which we patiently tried to request but were ignored.  We counted at least 11 people working there so that wasn't the issue.  When we eventually just gave up and pushed our plates away, our server came over and apologized profusely for forgetting us and could she bring anything.  I said we had wanted jam and...but before I could finish she took off to get a small bowl of jelly and left again.  At that point we just wanted to leave.  
The food here is honestly delicious, well except for the very dry toast.  But you need to request every single condiment individually - butter, coffee cream, jelly, ketchup, even a straw.  By the time you get it all, if you do, your food is cold.  
There are way too many great breakfast places in Scottsdale where service is not an issue.  Wish Snooze was one of them."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic!  Clean, bright and friendly. Service was on point. I was looking for a great breakfast spot and this was exactly what we needed. 

Eggs Benedict III were fabulous. My daughter had simple scrambled eggs that were simple but delicious. Oh, and the coffee was great (medium body and not bitter). 

We will be going back tomorrow."}
{"text":"I'm happy to have a breakfast here anytime.  Weekends tend to have longer waits than week days. They send you a text when your table is ready!  Starbucks next-door so you can chill with a coffee until your ready to be seated.

Snooze serves different kinds of Mimosas that are refreshing on a hot Arizona morning. Seems like they are heavy on the OJ and light on champagne.

I know their Breakfast Pot Pie is delightful!  It includes their homemade rosemary sausage gravy smothered inside a flaky puff pastry, topped with an egg anyway you prefer!  Comes with hash browns too. I have also had their Huevos Rancheros which is OK.  They have several different Eggs Benedict breakfasts on the menu - the Chile Verde Benny is good.  It has pulled pork over a stack of green chile sauced tortillas and melted cheese with poached eggs and green chili hollandaise, pico de gallo and cotija cheese.  FATTINESS!!

Clean bathrooms and lots of parking nearby."}
{"text":"Always my favorite breakfast place. Such a fun environment with the best service. I have had the same server my last 4 visits and he has been excellent! Shoutout to Eric for his friendly face and constantly happy attitude. Everyone has to come in for a visit! You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"The pineapple pancake is bomb!!! Plus they play 90s boy band music like backstreet boys and nsync. My kind of brunch place. The staff even danced to Bye Bye Bye"}
{"text":"N-O-I-S-Y breakfast place ... even with the front doors wide open.  At 0900AM, only waited 20 minutes to grab a table inside.  Ordered corned-beef hash with poblanos which was decent, but the corned beef was not flavorful enough to stand up to the other ingredients.  Good regular coffee, but if you want stronger, there is always Starbucks next door.  The scrambled eggs with the corned beef hash were terrific.  The service was terrific.  Using a text message to notify you when your table was available was brilliant.  
If I visit again, I will try one of the pancake varieties, although they seem to want to add extra sugary toppings to every pancake.  
Insanely noisy ... do not come hungover."}
{"text":"Food is ah-mahz-ing! All the servers were really nice too, even though it is packed in here on the weekends! 

Bestie and I came in for Sat brunch and ordered a Benny Duo (chilaquiles and chili verde) and a Sandwich I Am. We also ordered a michelada and a green tomato bloody mary. They were out of the normal beer they use for micheladas, so they subbed another beer and comped the drink, which I thought was really nice. The green tomato bloody mary was good, but I didn't like all the crushed up stuff at the bottom. It tasted gross and made the drink very difficult to drink. 

When the food came, there was Pico de Gallo on the plate even though we had asked for no Pico. Not that big of a deal to me, but my friend is allergic to cilantro. Since we were splitting the benedicts, I just gave her the halves that weren't touching the Pico, and it was all good. The sandwich, which was sausage, egg and cheese on a pretzel roll with a smoked cheddar hollandaise was to die for! The roll was soft on the outside but crispy on the inside, and the egg and cheese were all folded together. I could definitely eat that every day! 

Overall, solid brunch spot, but expect a wait of at least an hour. Also, service can be a little slow when they are super busy."}
{"text":"I LOVE SNOOZE AND I AM SO HAPPY ONE OPENED NEAR MY HOUSE!! 

The thing to know about snooze is their Benedict's and their pancakes are what set them apart from every other breakfast place.  I am obsessed with the standard eggs Benedict and the Bella Benny, such s fun twist on a Benedict and great flavor your would expect on a bruschetta but not on a breakfast dish.  And the strawberry shortcake pancake- with the lemon they put in there- I don't even know how they do it but the pancakes melt in your mouth and you will be craving them for days.

The only thing that I don't like are the potatoes- a little bland and boring, and the coffee is nothing special, but really I'm not going to snooze for either of those things. 

If you can go on a weekday I recommend that, the weekends are crazy! But if you do find yourself waiting it's absolutely worth the 40-50 minutes ."}
{"text":"If you're hungry for brunch COME HERE!!! The food is excellent and totally worth the wait that can sometimes get a little long on the weekends. 

They can make anything gluten free and they are very accommodating. They have 20 million different types of pancakes (maybe exaggerating a little) and they have an eggs Benedict flight so you can try different kinds!! I'm fairly certain they have the best bacon I've ever tasted. The food quality is insane. And it's not super expensive. The pancake flight is a super good idea if you can't decide and the breakfast tacos are soooooo tasty!!!! My husband is obsessed with the BEAT sandwich with over easy eggs. Coffee here is excellent! They have tons of different cocktails too for those looking for a lil buzz. 

The service is world class here too! It's like the cheers of brunch. Joshua makes the best coffee drinks and mans the bar. He's so cool and sweet and always says hi to us. Cray is also so super cool and we love getting her table because she's so much fun. 

Fun fact: makes a great first date spot - SNOOZE IS MAGIC!!! 

This has become our regular Sunday destination. I will recommend this place all day err day. Aaaaaand all the locations we've been to have been consistently awesome. This one is just our fave."}
{"text":"The Ham Benedict III is great. Also the Spuds Deluxe is another favorite. They quoted a 15-25 minute wait and it was more like 10 minutes so that was also good. Overall a great place for breakfast/"}
{"text":"Amazingly creative menu, and straight-up outstanding food.  We usually visit once per weekend and I've had just about every item on the menu, there is literally one thing that I didn't think was 5 stars, everything else is 5 PLUS stars.  After frequenting Snooze even our old favorite breakfast restaurants now don't taste quite as good, Snooze just has it down.  This past weekend we visited twice and had Christopher both days, two different recommendations (included something new to their menu), both were fantastic"}
{"text":"Service is not great. We went in & the girl behind the counter stacking flatware totally ignored is. Then the hostess showed up 5 mins later. The pancakes are great the rest of the menu is so-so. The coffee is as weak as Dunking Donuts coffee. I would pick Butters over Snooze for breakfast in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Their B.E.A.T sandwich is really good. It cost $11.91 but it is worth it.  It is Tender Bacon Belly with eggs, organic arugula and sliced tomato served with tomato -aioli on a toasted ciabatta roll and comes with hashbrowns. It is the most expensive BLT sandwich I have ever had but the flavors all mend together very well. I got mine without tomato and with my egg sunny side up as recommended. You can add Avocado if you like for an up-charge (which I did not but may next time) The staff was very friendly and the restaurant was lively and upbeat. Definitely will be visiting this place again soon."}
{"text":"The food and service are consistently outstanding.  Darrin, Manager, and Sarah, Server, always provide first class service.  I highly recommend that you visit this wonderful restaurant."}
{"text":"We lived in Fort Collins Co for three years.  This Snooze is every bit as good.  Hands down the best breakfast spot in the area.  The breakfast sandwich on a pretzel bun is amazing and I reccomended sharing a pancake with your date."}
{"text":"The ambiance is great, the food is really tasty. The wait is ridiculously long. Where they drop the ball is getting the (cleaned) tables sat. I've watched multiple tables empty for five mins before anyone was seated. Seat your patrons and the wait wouldn't be so ridiculous."}
{"text":"Snooze has the best pancakes in town. There is often a wait and the food takes awhile getting to the table, but it's worth the wait. You won't regret trying breakfast here."}
{"text":"Delicious food, healthy options! You can even order ala carte. Just don't go 30 min before close and sit at the bar..they will ignore the shit out of you."}
{"text":"Sooooo... last weekend I came here for brunch on Saturday AND Sunday.  Not ashamed - here's why.

Eggs benes are phenomenal here.  Dat hollandaise sauce...?  Yummmm.  Some of the best I've had.  I love that you can mix and match things here, so I usually get two different benes.  My favorite two are the Benny Goodman and the Bella Bella Benny.  I usually HATE prosciutto with eggs benedicts because most restaurants cook the prosciutto, which makes it super salty.  This one has a great balance and the prosciutto is not overwhelming.  If you're into the southwestern breakfasts, the Chilaquiles and Chile Verde Bennies are great as well.

Also - make sure you get a pancake flight here.  Sweet breakfast not your thing?  Great.  It's not mine either.  But I still get the pancake flight here, because their pancakes are delicious.  Again - the balance of flavors is amazing.  I've done the fancy pancakes at Butters, Eggstasy, Over Easy, etc, and they always overload the pancake with so many toppings so it feels like you're eating dessert.  This is the Goldilocks of fancy pancakes - not too sweet, not overwhelmed with toppings, juuuuuust right.

There's a couple of locations in the valley, and I'm sure they are all good.  Just make sure you get there early, because it will get crowded really quickly!"}
{"text":"If you like pancakes then this is the place for you.  Pancake flight and pancake of the day keeps things interesting.  Nice selection of ingredients for their omelets too.  Want things a certain way?  No problem as they seem to excel with custom orders.  Nice selection of \"modern\" breakfast items."}
{"text":"Don't snooze through this brunch. 
I loved the breakfast tacos with added pulled pork, they were incredibly filling. 
I also tried the sweet potato pancake which was sweet (shocker) & balanced with a bourbon tasting syrup. 
Service did not stand out but also did not disappoint.
The only bummer about this place is that since it's so delicious it's often busy and you end up usually on a waitlist for a table. 
But good things come to those who wait."}
{"text":"Had an early morning breakfast outside with great egg Benedict. Wonderful menu options Nd good service."}
{"text":"This place is my new breakfast and lunch spot. You better get here early,,,, there is always a wait.  Today was an hour wait but it was worth it. 

Our waitress was so nice and she was very helpful in helping me pick out the perfect breakfast item. 

My girlfriend had this amazing French toast.. With a aside of corn beef hash. Yummy!!!

I had the Heroes rancheros.... So good I couldn't stop eating it.  

Then the waitress brings out a complimentary pineapple upside down pancake...my soul just went to heaven and back!!!! This pancake is crazy good......

I'm coming back next week to try another amazing  breakfast item!"}
{"text":"1) Never eat here on a Sunday unless your not hungry and want to wait an hour or more 
 -Carry out is always a good idea 
2) The parking lot is a Zoo... it's gives me anxiety I suggest uber 
3) Breakfast tacos are the bomb.com"}
{"text":"Snooze is the truth. The only thing that could make this place better is getting down on some rec while you eat."}
{"text":"This place was great and fantastic service. It can get crowded and it's first come first served but they will text you when your table is ready so you can walk around the shops. Went at 8:30 on a Sat in June and the wait was 10-15. 
I had the Havana sandwich (4/5*) and my wife had another breakfast sandwich that I can't recall. The kid had the French Toast sticks and fruit which looked good."}
{"text":"Love the food here and service is usually pretty good. Since it's such a popular place, sometimes waiting can take long amounts of time to get a table or get your food. But the taste is worth it. The only thing I can say I don't like about this place is how loud it can be inside. Sometimes it is hard to talk to the person you are eating with.  One of the best things I have ever had at any restaurant is there freshly made apple juice, especially when it is made from honey crisp apples. My mom and I are crazy about this."}
{"text":"This is a great place for breakfast. I'm glad we got their on the early side (about 8:30 on a Sunday) and didn't have to wait for a table. After we were seated the place got super crazy."}
{"text":"I SO want to give this place 5 stars, but I just can't.  The place is adorable, the wait staff are wonderful and the food presentation was lovely, and GOOD BUT LUKE WARM!  Both of our dishes were only luke warm, which made them not enjoyable at all.   The eggs were just warm and my oatmeal was tepid.   The one thing that was HOT was a complimentary pancake which was wonderful and much appreciated!!  After talking to other friends, we found that they said the same thing and they will not return due to that.  I was so sorry, I want to go back, but I am wondering if this is an ongoing issue there.  So, that is why I had to give it only 3 stars...."}
{"text":"Started going to Snooze in CO, so happy to see one while on a biz trip to PHX!  I love eggs benny AND a stiff bloody mary...not many places can pair the two so well in such a hip setting.  Great service, great food, great looking place, always love Snooze and recommend them as much as possible!"}
{"text":"My favorite place for brunch! I can't say that enough. I blame my friend who took me here for my addiction. So then I took my husband there and he wants to bring his family here. Coffee is perfect and my favorite is the breakfast tacos. People are super friendly and always happy. I go now at least twice a month. Taking a new friend here in a week. No wonder they are always so busy there food is so good."}
{"text":"Food cold, eggs cold, sausage links still frozen inside, order was redone and still cold...disappointed..."}
{"text":"Came here for some Brunch and I will say I enjoyed it quite a bit! We came around 10 AM, so there was a bit of a wait (about 30 minutes), but we didn't mind since they send you a text when your table is ready, so you can walk around and not have to stay around the same spot. I ordered pancakes which were absolutely fantastic! They were thick and fluffy and filled me up. I tried some of the eggs from my girlfriend and the hash browns and both tasted great. The staff was friendly and the whole place had a laid back kind of charm to it all. I enjoyed it and definitely recommend giving it a look!"}
{"text":"Won't be back here, usually a pretty happy customer, I've been here plenty of times.  I Don't ask for much, always tip well, live across the street, but I won't be back here. The management is very nice, but the other employees need to learn about customer service."}
{"text":"Great tasting food very kid friendly. Menu has everything and we sampled each other's food which was delicious. We went sat am and waited about 20 minutes but it was worth it."}
{"text":"Four of us dined here, I had huevos ranchero it was a very good selection.  One friend had a scramble and she said it was not warm at all.  The other two were satisfied with their dishes."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast. Good coffee and an inventive menu. The tiramisu pancakes were yummy."}
{"text":"Snooze, where have you been all my life?!
Literally just discovered this place a month ago and I have already been back 3 times. I'd like to say I've been adventurous with the menu because everything looks fantastic, but I've been stuck on the breakfast tacos. I've made a promise to venture away from my new usual at my next visit.

The tacos are a huge portion (3 tacos) with eggs, hash browns, pico de gallo, and best of all-- green chill hollandaise sauce. So delicious!
I have also sampled one of their pancakes and I was equally impressed with their pineapple upside down pancake. It had small chunks of pineapple with a cinnamon butter and anglaise sauce, which almost tasted like a mix between melted vanilla ice cream and cream cheese frosting. 

The atmosphere is a little loud because it is always SO BUSY! Every time I have come there has been at least a 30 minute wait. Seating outside is nice because it is a little quieter. But it's busy because it's so good, so what can ya do?! I would definitely recommend Snooze if you are looking for a unique and hearty breakfast. So far everything I have tried has surpassed my expectations!"}
{"text":"I am currently in Scottsdale from out of state. I looked up reviews for local breakfast places and saw snooze had a good food rating, so my girlfriend and I decided to give it a shot.  We arrived and were promptly told of a 35 minute wait time; and were completely understanding. We made a short walk around the shopping center and then received a text saying our table was ready.  When we arrived back at the establishment we were informed that we were going to have to wait an extra ten minutes. It was busy so we were sympathetic.   Finally, they say they have a table ready, so we follow the hostess who proceeds to show us the only table on the patio that doesn't have an umbrella covering it. In Scottsdale. In August. 

We stood there assuming they were joking. When I asked if we could move one of the umbrellas,the hostess looked at me and said 'I don't know if I can move it'. 
Thankfully a couple in the shade was leaving, saw what was happening, and offered us their table.  

The service was mediocre to say the least."}
{"text":"We looooove snooze. Great menu and super great even when we have my toddler there she loves to color on the kids menus. Super friendly staff and we just love the menu. Such great food. It can get busy but the wait is never too bad.  The coffee is delicious and we love the breakfast pot pie.  Totally worth it for a morning brunch stop."}
{"text":"We just ate breakfast here while visiting Arizona after hearing a few people suggest it to us; we were not disappointed at all! I tried the pancake flight and they came out delicious. I will be stopping by for breakfast again the next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Must have the maple bacon! Omg! It's sticky and will clog your arteries but so worth it! Service was super fast even though it was busy!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was on my list of places to try and I'm glad I did. The good news:  Two of the tastiest Eggs benedicts I have ever eaten (they give you the option of picking two types and having a half order of each. One was an Eggs Benny--tender salmons, capers, cream cheese-hollandaise and softly poached egg. The other was a Bene Bene Benny--Italian charcuterie, like prosciutto, in a traditional Eggs Benedict. Topped with a drizzle of basaltic vinegar. Included crispy hash browns in a little cake shape. Yummy--even their ketchup was specially tasty!  Coffee was decent, smooth and HOT!  Plates cleared and bill cashed out quickly! Things that could be better:  Not much!  Perhaps  Benedicts could have been warmer, coffee filling could have been a touch more attentive."}
{"text":"Have to say...\"hands down, best breakfast I've ever had\"!  When it came I thought I will not be able to eat all this, but was gone in no time ; )"}
{"text":"This was the second Snooze we have been to and both were awesome. I don't give out Five Star, Snooze earned it. We had a 20 minute wait, at 10:00 on and Friday. Always a good sign, but prepare to wait. They have a full bar, with great breakfastish drinks. 
I had the Chile Verde Benny. Pulled pork with a Chile Verde Sauce. An awesome play on a Benedict. It was SO GOOD. All the other meals at the table, Chilaquiles Benedict and French Toast were incredible. One Snooze in Denver and one in Scottsdale, both delicious. If there is a Snooze around you, you've gotta go and enjoy."}
{"text":"I cant say enough great things about this place! My wife and I swing by Snooze for breakfast at least once a week and each visit is as delicious as the first! The ham bene, the pancake of the day and did I mention the mimosas from a champagne tap? Love Snooze!!!"}
{"text":"This got a lot of good reviews but it didnt hit the mark with us. We both got the Snooze special breakfast and found it just ordinary. The only thing special was it was way overpriced. Sorry, this one is crossed off our list for a repeat visit."}
{"text":"So so good! Best pancakes, best pancake flavors, very friendly service, full bar, child friendly, great coffee, great local ingredients and just really good food."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite breakfast joint in Scottsdale. They have an incredible selection on the menu, and if pancakes are your thing they get pretty creative with items like the pineapple upside down cake. Whenever I have been here they are just getting crushed as their is a 30 minute wait. I recommend sitting at the bar as it will usually shorten the wait and the bar team is fantastic and makes great am cocktails and espresso drinks. No complaints at all here just be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"Breakfast/brunch with the bestie this mid morning. We both enjoyed it very much. Great music and the atmosphere was bouncy and friendly. Not much of a wait and the food was great."}
{"text":"This is our go to breakfast place!! Nothing better Han having a mimosa for breakfast. My favorite thing are they're eggs Benedict. And they're pancake flight!! With pineapple upsidedown pancakes. Mm mm. Both Jason and Angelo are my go to servers!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, food came out super fast. Very child friendly with a kids menu and crayons for coloring. Food was above average for the area and the price was on par with the area average as well. Good iced, cold-Brewed coffee. The chile verde Benedict was excellent. Lots of variety on the menu. We came early on a weekday, so there was no wait. We tried a weekend and the wait was 45 minutes, so keep that in mind."}
{"text":"Very good. Our son had us meet him here for a late breakfast. The wait was half an hour, but no problem since he knew ahead it would be. He went in and got his name in, then we wandered the area for half an hour. My husband & I split eggs Benedict. After tasting, we wished we had each got our own order.  It was so good. Also the hash browns were nice and crispy. The inside wasn't huge, but was very cheerful and bright.  Next time...pancakes."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum!!! Excellent breakfast spot in Tempe! We stopped there before heading on a day trip to Sedona and went early (maybe 7 am). The service was excellent! I had the tacos and they were absolutely spot on! They brought us a sample of the white chocolate pancake special for the day and I wish I had room to eat a full sized portion of it!! Amazing chai latte as well! 

I was so impressed with this cute, clean, super yummy restaurant in Tempe and wish I had time to eat more breakfasts there!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal service, food & atmosphere! Prepare for a wait because it's a popular spot BUT they will send you a text when the table is ready and you can enjoy shopping in the meantime (location is perfect!). The Bella eggs Benny was fabulous with the balsamic glaze and the pancakes are out of this world! Definitely worth visiting again & again! Because we were first timers and trying the pancakes for the first time, our server bought our pancake... Top notch service!"}
{"text":"Amazing food with a fantastic wait staff. Hannah was the best!!! Thanks for an amazing time!"}
{"text":"So excited they will be opening a location in Addison TX soon. Tried this place for breakfast while visiting Scottsdale. We liked it so much we came back the next day. Service spot on both times. The food was great and the prices for the quality exceptional. They try and use as much locally produced options as possible. Would highly recommend this for breakfast/brunch. The spicy Bloody Mary is a good option! Get there early on the weekends or expect a wait. Even during the week it is popular."}
{"text":"OMG pancakes

also: Cheandra is the best server in the whole joint

(Seriously though this place is amaze and well worth the wait, my server was LEGIT, and best of all they played\"Yeah!\" While I was eating breakfast lol )"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast during the week, I bet it gets packed on the weekends.  They were very accommodating? to me and my 2 small kids, there wasn't a huge wait at 730am.  I also like that they had a feather-light? section flair if you are watching your calories.

I will definitely? come back."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday about a 40 min wait . Food and service was great ! A Must try for breakfast ."}
{"text":"Great food and environment. I'm from Chicago and we have so many breakfast places. This is one that can compete with them all."}
{"text":"Pros: welcoming hostesses, friendly servers, lots of fun atmosphere-great patio. Good location if you're shopping.  Good coffee/cappuccino selections
Cons:  45 minute wait for mostly froo-froo pumpkin pancakes and eggs of every style, drowning in assorted sauces made out of different colors of mayo.  That's what the menu has.  Very thick bacon-not nearly thoroughly cooked.  Undercooked hash brown cake-barely browned.  Slow slow service (albeit \"with a smile\").  Parking sucks.  Nothing  -PLAIN-  to eat ? No whole wheat or whole grain pancakes, no buckwheat pancakes, no regular French toast, what if you don't like pumpkin?  oh-and an \"small up charge\" for almost everything.  
Many better choices to go-nearby that have better Food."}
{"text":"we decided to try Snooze because it was close and had high ratings. When we got there we were told the wait was 20 minutes. It ended up being closer to 30. During that time we watched multiple people walk up tell them how many and got seated immediately while we waited for our text. Once seated I ordered the spuds which were way over salted. It was as if the cook dropped the shaker.  Food was very average for the price however our waitress was really attentive.  In the end we probably wouldn't return here."}
{"text":"We keep trying snooze and there is always something wrong. We aren't picky we don't ask for much, but whether it's cold breakfast tacos or a kids pancake where getting the initial serving of syrup takes 10 min after food arrives, we are definitely over Snooze. 

Today was the last time. The breakfast burrito had nothing breakfast about it. It's a bean and cheese burrito with a few hash browns and eggs in it. When they ask you if you want red or green sauce be careful, it isn't for dipping but placed on top like enchiladas and its marinara taste made it more like lasagna than burrito. 

So bad!!"}
{"text":"I love the creativity and the way they remix traditional breakfast. I ordered the pancake flight because I couldn't make my mind up but the sweet potato pancake was my favorite by far. The doughnut pancake & the original pancake were just average but the sausage & bacon (yes my husband ordered both ) were great (at least that's what he said). All in all a really good breakfast experience... Especially if your in the mood to try something different."}
{"text":"Annoying wait and a little loud but great text alert system. Amazing food. Had great peanut butter cup and cinnamon roll pancakes."}
{"text":"Honestly,

I don't think I have the words to describe how awesome my breakfast and cold brew coffee were, not to mention outstanding service and am upbeat attitude from our server Lauren!

The food speaks for itself, give it a try!!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Breakfast for lunch? I'm in! Walked over from our office about 12:30 and had the option to be seated inside or out, no wait at all. We opted for indoor. While we waited for our waitress another had come to take our drink order, kudos for that! I love that a breakfast restaurant offers a full bar. I ordered Juan's Breakfast Tacos and added chorizo as a meat topping, slight extra cost but nothing to turn me away. Food came out in no time at all and it was awesome! 3 yummy breakfast tacos, because who doesn't love breakfast and tacos!? And let me just add that the prices are reasonable for Scottdale. I will definitely be returning to stuff my face with other things on the menu!"}
{"text":"Wife and I just beat the crowd. Steak Benedict and corned beef hash were good but both eggs were undercooked"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite breakfast places in town. The wait is usually long, but the surrounding shopping is enough to keep one occupied. I've had the breakfast burrito, hashbrown plate, and peanut butter cup cupcake -- all of which have been fantastic. I personally prefer to sit outside, as the interior can get loud and a little stuffy."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday (for the first time) and it was kind of busy but not to terrible. And we waited about 5 mins for someone to ask what we wanted to drink, the server was super nice but I think he had to many tables to wait on because he hardly ever came back. I took about twenty mins to get our food and I have to say I was petty disappointed. the pancake tasted like pure flour with powdered sugar on top. and the bacon was way to over cooked."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is lively and happy. The food is great and the portions are fit for a King......best visit to start your day!!
I really believe that while it's all so very good, it's the people that make this snooze electric for me. 
The general manger Zack and manager Daren care deeply about the customer experience and always remember my name! The staff that makes the place rock for me are just wonderful people. Whether it's Amanda, Kylee, Amber, Robert or Rose. They greet me with big smiles and actually put up with me!  
Please visit and share the great experience I've been so lucky to discover at the Scottsdale Snooze!"}
{"text":"been here many times, like can be long at times. the corn beef hash is excellent and there egg benedict items are good."}
{"text":"We used to come regularly. We've noticed quality going down each time, and this time it was terrible. Won't be coming back. Unless you are here for pancakes, I would compare the rest of their food to a chain like Denny's.

I got the spuds deluxe. The hash browns were barely cooked. They use the cheapest bulk shredded cheese on top of it. The presentation was extremely sloppy. The avocado had brown spots and didn't look fresh. The only reason I ate it was because it was 2:30 and it was my first meal of the day (so really hungry).

My fiance's dish wasn't good either. The toast was burnt. The maple syrup was not the consistency of maple syrup. If it was real at all, it seemed to be watered down in effort to save money and hope their customers don't notice.

They seem to be using more vegetable oil instead of butter now. The eggs didn't appear to be cooked in butter anymore. The egg yolks were dull yellow. They used to be a much richer yellow orange, so unless they got a bad batch, they seem to be going cheap on their eggs too. The eggs used to have salted butter. And they forgot to salt anything. There was no salt at the table and ketchup wasn't offered. But these are service than quality complaints.

The chain is going downhill. They have expanded too fast to maintain quality.

I would recommend skipping Snooze unless you want pancakes. There are many better breakfast options."}
{"text":"Mediocre food and service at best. Corned beef hash was super greasy, over medium eggs were barely cooked, toast showed up after I ate my meal and they tried to charge us for ham - that they forgot to bring - that was included in the meal. We never got coffee or refill waters. Not worth the wait or money."}
{"text":"Came here on Saturday morning for breakfast. Kylee and Leila always take such great care of us. We had the omg French toast and probably the best blueberry pancakes I've ever had! By far the best breakfast spot in AZ!"}
{"text":"Spring Benny did not disappoint. Perfectly crafted Hollandaise sauce smothering the poached egg and cheesy quinoa biscuit. Yum! OMG French toast was the perfect way to finish. Good thing i shared portions with my daughter!! Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Snooze puts the fun back in breakfast, and is a well needed addition to the North Scottsdale scene. Upon walking in your greeted by friendly service and a nice cup of their unique coffee. By far the greatest asset this place has is its bright and inviting interior mixed with a diverse menu. While I appreciate a greasy spoon breakfast, it is also nice to have a healthy option. From pumpkin pancakes to Kale salads , this place delivers. It also has a nice bar, which adds to the breadth of consumers that this place can serve. Add on an owner who would backpack through Guatamala just to find the right coffee beans and you have a hit. Has defiantly taken over as my favorite breakfast spot in Scottsdale!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place! I ordered the pancake flight: upside down pineapple, blueberry something, and the special (orange crunch). The Orange crunch was phenomenal! Blueberry was Lynnette favorite. The pineapple is very good but next to orange crunch and blueberry cakes that were very sweet, it wasn't as strong. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Staff was exceptionally friendly and efficient. One hostess took my cell phone number so they could notify me when my table for one was ready. They told me 10 minutes, but in half that time the hostess came to find me personally to let me know they had a table for me. I was seated outside (at my request) in the mild pre-winter Arizona sun. I ordered the Fallen morning cocktail (with sparkling plus tart cherry), a sweet potato pancake, and a side of bacon. Within 5 minutes of placing my order, a food runner presented me with a small cinnamon roll pancake, saying that it was courtesy of my server for having to wait. That thing was delicious. But that sweet potato pancake...let me tell you something! It tasted like chunks of sweet potato pie wrapped in heavenly buttermilk fluffiness, topped off with a ginger butter, candied pecans, and a warm caramel sauce. Goodness gracious almighty. 

Thanks to my server, Lila, for being a class-act sweetie! 

I highly recommend Snooze at the Kierland Commons in Scottsdale AZ, for the food, the service, the experience."}
{"text":"This place never ever disappoints!!! My fav is the pancake flight....they are so creative with the flavors here. It's a wonderful family treat after church. Oh I almost forgot....be prepared to wait at least 45 min for a party of 3!!"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS food, fun and friendly ambiance. It's a scottsdale MUST! 

I had a Benedict dish and I'm very picky. This was sooooo good it lasted only a few minutes. 

Also quite kid-friendly. You will likely have a wait to be seated, but it's well worth it."}
{"text":"Quaint and trendy! Start your day with the recommended hash or benedict. Wait, what's this, mimosa's. Now we are talking. Nice touch. I had my usual breakfast, a scramble with spinach, tomatoes and crispy bacon. Nailed it! I'm excited! Good food, nice staff, fun atmosphere, Internet and alcohol. I can't wait to bring friends."}
{"text":"Darren and his whole staff couldn't have been friendlier and the food was amazing... 5 Star experience at such an affordable price is rare.. a must go!"}
{"text":"We went to snooze to celebrate Father's Day and we were lucky enough to plan ahead and get their early so we didn't have to wait! The service was great and our waitress was helpful. 

The whole table got the snooze classic and was satisfied. We also split a pancake flight: cinnamon roll, chocolate chip, and blueberry streusel. I was disappointed by the pancakes flavor and texture wise. This may have been due to the fact that I had high standards after eating daily dose cinnamon roll pancakes. But, it was a bit of a let down. The pancakes were stiffer and harder than I would have liked and the flavor just wasn't working for me. 

The bacon though, extra crispy without having to ask for it!"}
{"text":"This place is fabulous! Great meal and service! I love the variety of Bennys!! Can't wait to come back and try more!"}
{"text":"This restaurant gets a lot of hype, but not from me.  Our server was rude, like she didn't have time for us, and the food was ok..but not great.  The atmosphere is pretty bland, and the seats are not comfortable!  Overall it was just ok, and there are PLENTY of great places to eat breakfast."}
{"text":"Snooze went beyond my expectations. Pleasantly greeted upon entry. Sat in a good location. Greeted by a server almost immediately. The food blew my mind. Everything was cooked perfectly. The bacon was thick cut and cooked exactly to my liking. The atmosphere set a great mood and everyone was polite. I would recommend this amazing joint to anyone who enjoys their breakfast. I don't know if i will eat breakfast at any other place again. I feel spoiled! Lol."}
{"text":"Long waits. Mediocre food. Slooooooooooooooooooow service. Ve been 3 times now, hoping each time would be better. Denny's is better on price and flavor but this place good for overall theme/environment. Maybe a good spot for a get together with friends where you plan to hang for a long time chatting of you are looking for a quick and solid breakfast this is not it."}
{"text":"Super fun breakfast place!  Great menu, great service, and a lovely location.  This eatery is always packed, even in the early hours. That should tell you all that you need to know.  If you love any breakfast food, you will love Snooze.  And, best of all, yes they have mimosas too!  #Sold"}
{"text":"Forgot to write a review of this spot. We came here last month for our holiday and it was busy for a Monday morning! Our wait time was about 20 minutes so we sat on the couches outside Starbucks. Lots to choose from on their menu and I ordered the Benny Goodman, which has \"lox style salmon and cream cheese served over toasted rye and topped with poached cage free eggs, cream cheese hollandaise blended with sun dried tomato and caper relish\" (straight from the menu). I got hash browns on the side which came in a tower-like and we made sure there were hot sauce options brought to the table for us to utilize. I enjoyed my plate and my family seemed to like what they ordered as well. Service was good and loved the decor, even the water glasses each had a different color design.  

I'd probably go back, nice breakfast/brunch spot in Kierland."}
{"text":"Great food and customer service! I personally love their Eggs Benedict and the OMG French Toast."}
{"text":"Favorite spot in town to grab breakfast!! Food is amazing, service and atmosphere are also good! 5 stars."}
{"text":"A great breakfast place no matter what you are looking for.  They have healthy options, sweet delicious pancakes and savory items.  I love the sweet potato hash, I would eat it every time.  But then the sweet treat pancakes are amazing.  Keep an eye out for the daily pancake special, they are always amazing.  Come hungry and be prepared to have left overs."}
{"text":"Great food!  We had awesome service from our bartender Lila!  Thanks for a great start to our anniversary weekend!"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast.  1st time @Snooze, but we loved it.  My wife had the blueberry pancakes with lemon cream cheese in the middle and it was like having desert for breakfast.  I had the green Chile Benedict with pulled pork - WOW!  Great service by Holly made for an overall 5 star breakfast experience.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great recommendation for breakfast. Specialty bloody Mary's  and mimosas. Huge selection of wonderful memu items. Complementary coffee while waiting, normally 15-30 minutes.
Our server Lila was friendly, courteous, professional, attentive  and made  great menu recommendations, especially the homemade chicken sausage and lox plate. Best time for short wait is after 10:30 AM."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast/brunch spot with beautiful outdoor seating and views of the Scottsdale Quarter. Started with some grapefruit mimosas which at $6 were more than the competition (the Vig offers them at $3) but to Snooze's credit their mimosas were fairly large. Husband ordered chocolate chip pancakes and I tried their signature sweet potato pancakes which were to die for! They come with ginger butter and candied pecans. Food prices were very reasonable, $7 for 2 large pancakes. Neither of us finished them. Friendly service, busy place full of happy people, and you can go walk around the Quarter and hang out in the park when you're done eating. We will add this to our favorite brunch places!"}
{"text":"Love this breakfast spot!  It has become our go-to!The seasonal dishes have been among my favorites from their menu.  The mixed greens they offer, instead of bread/potatoes, are so delicious...they are the first item to disappear from my plate."}
{"text":"We visited this trendy little Snooze chain over at Town and Country a couple of years ago. 

From memory, I can recall being quoted by the hostess that it would be a two-hour wait, despite actually being twenty minutes. I remember it being very loud and really pushing the whole booze/brunch concept to the point where I just rolled my eyes. Pancake flights, mimosas, and kindly accommodating to everyone who magically became gluten intolerant in the last five years. It's cool, but kind of a cliche these days.

This Scottsdale location, on the other hand, offers a similar menu in a slightly more \"posh\" shopping center. Sunday early-afternoon wait time was only twenty minutes, which unlike before, was actually accurate. Forgetting my damn-near mandatory Sunday brunch \"activewear,\" I felt oddly out of place.

I ordered the Snooze Spuds Delux, which is basically hashbrowns covered in a combination of cheese and sauce/meat that you decide upon. My girlfriend ordered the Snooze Classic, which is a traditional bacon/eggs/hash combo.

They've apparently changed their hashbrowns to a more traditional form as opposed to those stupid little \"cakes\" that they were previously using. Or maybe they were just experimenting today. Who knows. 

My deluxe was okay for what it was. Nothing was particularly bad - but nothing didn't really stand out either. My girlfriend's bacon was actually very high quality, while I found the hash and muffin to be just kind of standard-fare stuff that is similar to what you'd get at most places. 

The OJ I ordered was better than expected, so kudos to them for getting it right there.

Honestly, the food was reasonably priced by avoiding any liquor, so there are definitely no complaints there. In this regard, I do feel it's a good value for the food you receive. But would we ever move Snooze into regular rotation with so many other places available?

Probably not.

Nevertheless, I'd still recommend it if you \"dig\" the whole trendy brunch scene or just simply want to opt for the \"OHH MY GOD!!!!!\" French Toast while intensely screaming your order at the server for extra effect.

Snooze obviously has its fair share of fans, but I still prefer my local establishments over these glammy new-age joints."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast places in town great bloody Mary's and mimosas and the food you can't go wrong with the pancakes or the eggs Benedict"}
{"text":"Accept that you will wait 45 minutes to an hour, plan accordingly, and eat HERE! They text you when your table is ready so shop, grab Starbucks next door, people watch. My second time eating at a Snooze. First time at this location. EVERYTHING on the menu sounds amazing! I love the Benny Duo option where you can choose 2 different eggs benedict options. My Bella Bella and I Like You Elote combo was the best breakfast I ever ate. Taste buds firing in all directions. Breakfast potatoes are rarely good, but these hashbrowns are yummy and crisp. SO good! Great big, hot mugs of excellent coffee. Nice outdoor seating area. Affordable pricing. Great tasty and creative menu. Happy, friendly staff working in a fast paced restaurant."}
{"text":"Met our daughter for lunch on a Tuesday. No waiting at 12:15 PM. Great place for breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"The management from Snooze, base out of Colorado really cares and follows up to make this Returaunt top not for customer service."}
{"text":"This place is unique, top quality, tons of choices, and fun.  The staff is attentive and professional.  If you are a out of town guest make sure you visit.  You will not find one like this back home.  Food is excellent and plenty of it.
Great food and excellent service.   The best there is in North Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Wow. Just wow. Everything was absolutely perfect. As self proclaimed breakfast snobs my husband and I have been in search of the perfect breakfast place in Phoenix and have come up short every time until today. I first want to thank Jordan for the best service we have had in a really long time. Both of us work in the industry and she made sure that our experience was absolutely perfect. The ambiance and vibe was really fresh and exciting. And last the food. Everything was amazing. We had the breakfast pot pie Bella Bella Benny Havana dreaming breakfast tacos and cinnamon roll pancake and everything was better than the next. Oh and the bankock bloody marry is the best I've ever had you have to get one. This will definitely be our go to breakfast spot from now on. Thank you snooze and Jordan for an amazing breakfast."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast place. All the locations are great but this one and the Town and Country location are my favorites. 
Service is always good. The staff have cheery attitudes and are attentive. Food comes out in a timely manner, even when they're slammed.
I always get the eggs Benedict (ham the third) but I truly love the omg French toast too! The breakfast pot pie and breakfast burrito are super huge though just as a warning!
Will always love Snooze!
You know it's good when there is a huge wait !"}
{"text":"This place is spot on for breakfast! It is unique. Usually you go for breakfast and it's very ordinary. This place is extraordinary!!! The service is great, cool ambiance... Yes there was a wait but it was surprisingly worth it. We had the corn beef hash and the Benedict's .... Delicious I loved the hot Bloody Mary!"}
{"text":"Sweet potato pancakes were great.  The tacos, the flavor seemed off with the hollandaise sauce....   Fun menu, service could be better.  Felt like they were rushing us out.  Brought the check literally a couple of minutes sheet the food.   Cleared the plates pretty aggressively, brought out to go drinks even before the bill was paid...."}
{"text":"Got to Snooze around 8. Got seated with no waiting. Unfortunately, we fell in the black hole for at least 5 minutes,as no one even looked at us. I finally grabbed a waitress, who apologized profusely, and promptly served us. Our food was very good (Danish blackberry pancakes, Bella Bella Benny), and we were comped half our bill for having to wait a little bit. Great restaurant and great service. Gonna be back."}
{"text":"I wanna have breakfast there every day!!!!
The best huevos rancheros I've ever had!!!
The waitress name was Laurren,she's fantastic.
I'm going back there tomorrow,because I can't stop thinking about their food.
Go team Snooze Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"We love it here! Best bloody Mary's. Robert provided top notch service. Our new brunch spot!"}
{"text":"Such a cute little place. I'm bummed I didn't get more pictures of the inside, but it was so busy and did t think people would like me taking pictures of them eating ha ha. It took about 25 minutes for us to get a table, but it wasn't too bad. There's some chairs outside in the shade and Starbucks for a quick coffee next door if needed. We ordered our drinks when seated and once our breakfast was ordered we had it pretty quick. It looked perfect and my wheat toast was yummy. I ordered simple scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns and the toast. I mixed the pineapple and orange juice together and it's heavenly. I really enjoyed the atmosphere, how colorful everything was, and decent prices for what you get. I was however very, very disappointed in our service. Our waitress Amanda  seemed to be having an awful day or something. She seemed very irritated when we asked for anything. When she was clearing our plates after we were done I said thank you and she literally got this snotty look in her face and just walked away. I was with my daughter and her friend and they both just dropped their jaw at how blatantly rude she was. Not friendly or even a smile our entire time there. The hostess was awesome and cheery as well as the woman who brought our food. Hopefully Amanda was just having an off day because If that's how she treats all of her tables I'd never come back. Again great, great food, but man that made our morning a bit fowl."}
{"text":"This was my first breakfast place tried in my initial move to phoenix. The atmosphere is awesome with great patio seating or dine inside where the waiters/waitresses serve you with a smile and great attitude. I had the 3 cheese omelet with a side of homestyle potatoes. if your looking for the comforts of home this is the place to go."}
{"text":"This is a tasty brunch spot with creative and fresh cocktails. The brunch spot is trendy, with a small bar area, some tables indoors and a few tables on the patio. My group was seated on the patio and our wait time on a Saturday morning about 10:30 am was about 35 minutes. 

I ordered The Lower East Sider with lox style salmon and accouterments including herbed goat cheese spread, sun-dried tomato and caper relish, hard-boiled egg, dressed greens and rustic bread. At the suggestion of our server I added avacado to the meal. Absolutely mouth wateringly delicious. 

My drink included the Snooze Fashioned
Elijah Craig Bourbon, Cold Brew Coffee, Orange Simple Syrup, and a hint of Angostura Bitters. I was curious how coffee and bourbon would pair together - absolutely what I needed to get a jump start to the day. The combination of bourbon and coffee was a pleasant surprise!

The service was friendly and the food delivered to our table timely. I enjoyed the cocktail selections as they were creative and fresh. 

Tip: Plan to put in your name and go shopping nearby during the wait time. You can also go to Starbucks next door and just relax while you wait for your table, as the restaurant has a texting service notify you once your table is ready!"}
{"text":"Love this place so much. The consistency at every location I've been is impressive, but what stood out for us on this trip was our server, Chris. He was so attentive and made sure we were taken care of throughout our meal.  Also, as always the food is exceptional!"}
{"text":"Honestly...best breakfast I've had in forever! We ordered the Breakfast Burrito (HUGE), the Rueben (Yum!) and the Sunrise Benedict, I think it was called (think poached eggs, quinoa patty, Caprese Salad on top...delicious!). Cute atmosphere and friendly staff! Must go back!"}
{"text":"So I'll say first and foremost, there is almost always a wait. At least 30 min, if you're looking for something quick try elsewhere. You can't make reservations, but that's what happens when you get a line out the door when it opens. Trust me when I say it is well worth the wait though! The food is amazing, I've never tried anything here that I haven't enjoyed, my favorite part is they can make almost everything gluten free, which for someone who can't eat it, that's magic to me. Their pancakes are perfect for those with a sweet tooth and everything else I very savory. They have incredibly healthy options as well, including house made chicken sausage and other meat substitutions. If you're a Bloody Mary fan, this is the place to go, they have delicious concoctions, my boyfriends favorite is the Bangkok. Service is always wonderful, the staff truly loves their jobs and it have a fun old diner theme to it. I've lived in Phoenix my whole life, been to nearly every eating establishment, and I can say without a doubt snooze is my absolute favorite breakfast place."}
{"text":"Highly recommend this brunch spot! They have a great variety of breakfast options and are able to adapt almost any meal. We also ordered hot beverages that we did not like after tasting and they were happy to exchange them for different drinks without charging us extra. If you're going on a weekend, make sure to come earlier or you'll be waiting!"}
{"text":"This is in my top three favorite breakfast places. I'm obsessed with the breakfast tacos (add avocado) and the spiked hot chocolate, but you can't go wrong with any of their seasonal pancakes - or really anything on their menu. The service is always outstanding and the prices I consider to be on the higher side of reasonable. The only down side is usually the wait, so I try to go during the week when it's closer to a 20 minute wait rather than the hour-plus on weekends."}
{"text":"Came in this morning for my very first Snooze experience. It was wonderful! The food was on par, the service was outstanding and the atmosphere was great. There was about a 45-60 minute wait to sit inside, but we were able to get a table out on the patio immediately. While it was a little warm, it was great to see such a long wait for a restaurant that just opened last week. Our server was great and on top of everything. 

As for the food, it was all outstanding. Between the three of us, we were able to try:
Corned Beef Hash
Cinnamon Bun pancake (out of this world)
Veggie Omelette
Hashbrowns 
Fresh fruit
Taco (amazing)
Mimosa (full glass which was great for $6)

With 3 other locations in the valley, I will definitely return to try out all the other delicious items on the menu!"}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorites, but not anymore.  When I asked if they have freshly squeezed orange juice, the waitress said \"yes\".  I asked her a second time to confirm and she replied with another \"yes\".  I tasted the OJ and immediately knew it wasn't freshly squeezed.  I asked another waitress and she told me that the OJ comes in a plastic jug and it came in the other day.
I don't think they understand what \"freshly squeezed\" means.  

And the $10.00 OMG French Toast is sorely overpriced.  It left me hungry and disappointed.  I should have gone to Denny's or IHOP instead."}
{"text":"Most delicious breakfast I've had! Despite the long wait for the food I love eating at snooze! I got the OMG French toast which was super sweet but really good 10/10 recommend"}
{"text":"Sister told us about Snooze, so we went today. Our server, Amber, was probably the best server we've ever had. Knowing it was our first visit, she brought over a new pancake to try & went above & beyond. Our food was amazing! Try the pineapple upside down pancake with creme anglaise!"}
{"text":"Yes I'm addicted to Snooze especially their pancakes so soft,light and fluffy.This time i tried their sweet potato pancake along with blueberry and upside down pineapple(my favorite).i was quite skeptical to try them but our server convinced me otherwise.The only time i like my sweet potatoes are when they are fries.Surprising to say the least sweet potatoes do make a good pancake,would i order them again .. not really! but they are worth a try and i do congratulate the effort.

My OMG! french toast was good,i just prefer not to add the toasted coconuts.I got my eggs well done and my hash was crisped on request.Again i'm quite happy but i have had better hash.All said and done this place is something that should not be missed.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"What a place! We sat on the cutest little bright and fabulous patio! Our experience was nothing short of INCREDIBLE! Joe was funny, witty, and provided a wealth of options to the food experience! Talk about enjoyable, I don't live in the area but I will be back!"}
{"text":"I live near here. Which is a bad thing. Because I eat the pancakes, the best in the world, bar none, way too often.

The blueberry Danish pancakes are orgasmic. 

Pineapple Upside Down pancakes and sweet potato pancakes are out of this world too.

Ask for the Pancake Of The Day and get a Pancake Flight if you want to sample three of the pancakes.

The bacon is almost as good as the bacon at any Four Seasons hotel.

If you're lucky enough to get Anthony or Cray Cray as your server, you'll have an even better time."}
{"text":"First time here and they did not disappoint. Classic mimosa followed by corned beef hash and eggs = match made in heaven. Definitely worth the wait...be prepared as this is a hot spot but well worth it!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Chilaquiles Benedict and it was quite possibly the best breakfast I've ever had. Their mimosa selection is also awesome and the servers were very friendly. I would suggest this place to anyone."}
{"text":"We took our 20-something son here when he was out on a visit to see us.  We all loved it, and he was really impressed with the Chilaquiles Benedict.  He said it was the best he'd ever had (and he's tried several of these similar eggs benedict dishes on both East and West Coast!)."}
{"text":"I think I have tried everything on the menu by now, everything is OUTSTANDING! The OMG French toast and tacos are my favorite. Their vanilla latte is Uber tasty too! Breakfast burrito, Benny Benedict are other favorites! A MUST GO RESTAURANT! Very healthy but amazing taste, big portions!"}
{"text":"First time there arrived half hr after they opened but they said they had to make decaf. Unfortunately it was not ready til after my breakfast

Kinda sucked

What i did get was ok but overpriced but expected given the location

Not going back"}
{"text":"The breakfast is yummy! Luckily we came on a day and time that wasn't too busy. My last time in AZ we called around 11 and they had a 2 hour wait so it was nice to have been seated right away."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Snooze for a long time now and every time I visit the Camelback location, I have a wonderful experience. The Kierland location has always lacked something. However, my family and I dined at the Kierland location this afternoon, 6/22. 
The \"something\" that had been lacking was definitely customer service. Our waitress seemed like she had better places to be and didn't even introduce herself to us upon taking our drink orders. When she brought back our drinks, she didn't even offer us water. Shortly after, my father and I had finished our drinks quickly and then had nothing on a 107 degree day. We couldn't seem to find her anywhere, couldn't flag her down when we did see her, and didn't even know her name to ask for her. I hated doing this, but I pushed my empty glass all the way to the edge of the table in an effort to get someone's attention. Nothing. 
When our food came, it wasn't even our waitress who brought it out, thus still no drinks even when we asked that waitress for them. My corned beef hash was almost completely burned black, but I was so hungry I ate it anyway. 
Anyway, our waitress finally came back and offered to refill my father's coffee and then left before I could ask for water. When she came back I ordered my water and then saw her go behind the bar and talk to some of the other FOH staff for awhile before finally bringing my water. 
We finally found out what her name was when we received the bill (Jordan) and we aren't even sure that the name was her's. 
To sum it up, this is the last time I try this location. I think I'll make the further drive to Camelback next time."}
{"text":"I love the retro hipster atmosphere. Delicious cocktails and the food is delicious. Lots of vegetarian options for me as well. I highly recommend the egg white frittata. My husband the non-veg head got the chili verde Benedict and loved. By the way, Bloody Mary mix is vegan!! I never get them because of the Worcester sauce so that is perfect. Waitress Jordan was the best. Zac the manager stopped by our table to check on us and was very cool. Staff all made sure we had a great experience. We will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"You have to have the French toast here. It's the best dessert to have after a meal or if you're just craving something sweet! It has a vanilla cream inside that just hits the spot. It's sweet but not heavy- just perfect!"}
{"text":"One thing I LOVE about my wife is that she knows how to ride a bike ;-) we took a ride to snooze for some breakfast and got there in time to beat the crowd. Of course Barton is always a fav of ours and that's because service is great! No Sunday morning is complete without a Bloody Mary and black coffee ... you'll find both here at snooze. The pancakes are good my wife loves the pineapple upside down cakes I personally love their Benedict's any of them. I've tried them all. So freakin good!"}
{"text":"We have finally found a breakfast place that we can say is quality, unique, delicious & everything we've been searching for...the staff was hospitable...expect a wait- Thursday at 10:30 there was a 20 minute wait, but you can go walk around the shops at Kierland & they will txt you when your table is ready... we opted for the bar where we were graciously greeted by Heather...our experience was perfection!  We had an assortment of Benedict style eggs, the eggs were so beautifully poached, it was truly an exceptional meal...they make a great Bloody Mary as well... Heather also introduced us to their Pineapple Pancake,  Wow!  Thanks Heather!  One other thing that my husband & I both said was that we were full but not stuffed, the portions are just right & the quality ingredients are quite evident!  We can't wait to return!!"}
{"text":"The selection is tremendous and the food was delicious. Though the coffee was thin. Pleasant waitress and a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Best hollandaise eveah!!! Had the Benny duo- Bella Bella and caprese... Delicious!! Hubby had another Benny duo - chilaquiles and Chile Verde... Omg!! I will come back for both duos....our daughter had the blueberry pancake.. Great batter!!.....oooh don't forget the spicy bloody Mary! Soooo goood!
I would have given them 5 stars.. But need to take 1 away for the 45 minute wait :)"}
{"text":"I didn't have super high expectations of this place since it's a chain but my ham egg Benedict was good and by hubby's chile verde Benedict was really good. His entree was like a deconstructed pork taco on corn tortilla muffin.  The place is pretty loud trendy and happening. Service was very good as well."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Harvest Eggs Benedict is on point. If the wait time is 30 mins, wait. It's worth it."}
{"text":"The huge hype is accurate! Fantastic gourmet breakfast foods with outstanding service. Our waitress was so nice we were given a free pancake trio to test. Pineapple, cinnamon, berry. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Snooze is amazing and hands the the best breakfast place I've been to.  It's easy to say that many people agree with me as the wait can be a little long at times but always worth it.

They are strict about no reservations and they will not put your name on the list until they see you in front of them.  Once your name is down they will text you when your table is ready, it's usually between 15 minutes to an hour and they are always within the stated time.  The wait goes by quick as there are many stores around to kill time- including Scottsdale Quarter on the other side of Scottsdale Road.  Oh, and they even have free coffee for you while you wait for your table.

The food is always amazing, the menu changes depending on the time of the year.  I'm pretty loyal to the breakfast pot pie as that has never let me down.  The service is always great, staff is Dutch Bros like (peppy and eager to talk to you).

All in all, I love this place.  Highly recommend.

Return factor- 100%"}
{"text":"Excellent place for brunch. It was pretty busy, but we were sat within ten to fifteen minutes. The server was very nice. She brought our drinks right away. I ordered a chi latte-super delicious! She recommended the bacon. I'm not a huge fan of bacon, but I trusted her. It was worth it. I'm still thinking about the bacon two days later... We received the check right when we asked for it and got it back right away. I only point this out because it was very busy and our server was able to manage her time very well. I highly recommend this location of snooze!"}
{"text":"Breakfast tacos!!!! The OMG French toast was so good I ordered a second round. The place is lively and fun, and always busy. The facilities are clean and the staff are happy and work well together. Amber was great behind the bar! She moves 100mph and keeps a positive attitude and maintains conversations with guests. Very satisfied with our Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"Usually when I rate a place 4 stars I'm definitely going to become a return customer. However, I seriously will never make it back to Snooze again any time soon. Not that it wasn't great--it was! But it was a Thursday morning at 8:00 a.m. We both happened to have the day off work to run some wedding-related errands and this during-the-week-early-morning time is the ONLY time I've cruised by Snooze without an hour-plus wait. 

And I mean, I get it. It's amazing and delicious and has a great following from Colorado, yadda yadda. But there are seriously no places worth waiting that long on the weekends when there are millions of other breakfast patios to grace in Scottsdale. 

That being said, our first trip was glorious! We snagged a table out on the patio and our friendly server was prompt with iced coffee and menu recommendations. I went with the breakfast burrito, sans cheese, add chicken sausage and green chili sauce. THAT SAUCE! Some of the best verde ever, and TONS of it...but without making the burrito soaked? Not sure how, but so delicious. Fiance went with a BYO omlette, with some of what he said was the tastiest bacon of life. Corn tortillas on the side instead of toast. (LOVE this option.) 

Of course, we'd have been remiss to not sample at least one pancake option at Snooze. Our server recommended the cinnamon roll pancake, and it did NOT disappoint. The cinnamon butter served atop. OMG. The candied pecans, the icing glaze, the vanilla chips...everything.

The portions are huge here, and try as we might, we definitely couldn't finish any one plate. We will definitely try to be back...but it will have to be for a random weekday experience."}
{"text":"The food is unreal good but Hannah is one of the best waitresses my GF and I have had in a while! Ask for her when you check this place out and make sure she gives you her \"top 5\" recommendations."}
{"text":"While the wait is always horrendous, Snooze is my favorite breakfast EVER. There is nothing better than a side sweet potato pancake with a breakfast burrito."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and wonderful service! We waited 30 minutes since the place was packed but I can see why! The food is incredible! I was happy they served lattes with almond milk and had a few vegetarian and vegan options.

Our server, Hannah was so thoughtful and recommends a lot! You MUST try the pineapple upside down pancake. I've never had a more fluffy and flavorful one in my life! 

Next time I go to Scottsdale, I will eat at Snooze again!"}
{"text":"Read the reviews for Snooze and loved the unique menu choices.  Arrived about 10am on a Monday morning and it was crowded.  Always a good sign!  We waited about 10-15 minutes for a table.  Once seated we ordered coffee and were delighted with a sample of the pineapple upside down pancake being delivered complimentary to try (they were serving them to everyone the day we were there).  We all loved the unique pancake, but disagreed over the cinnamon butter.  I preferred it without.  It allowed the pineapple to showcase more vibrantly, my sister loved it with.  Mom agreed with me.  We then ordered Juan's breakfast tacos with bacon and also with chorizo and a breakfast burrito was with green chili hollandaise for the sauce without meat.  The tacos also come with the green chili hollandaise and it was tasty!  Not too rich or spicy.  A great accompaniment.  The bacon tacos were good.  Crispy thick bacon in smaller pieces.  Very good!  The chorizo stole the show for us.  It was spicy and flavorful and not greasy at all.  This is the number one reason we error on the side of caution ordering chorizo and hands down this was the best chorizo we've ever had in a breakfast spot!  Two enthusiastic thumbs up!  Burrito was tasty and beans were hearty enough that the breakfast meat wasn't missed.  Coffee is delicious.  Service was very friendly and we thoroughly enjoyed our breakfast!!!  Definitely would go back and would recommend this as a great place for tasty breakfast food!"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! One of the best breakfast joints in the Valley. Enjoyed the creative early morning cocktail selection. Food was spot on, service was prompt without being \"hovering\". Great experience."}
{"text":"I had the OMG! French toast the sauce they put into was to die for good. The wait wasn't too crazy and the staff was  very personable making it a great experience."}
{"text":"Love going to Snooze on the weekends! Have the best breakfast burrito and breakfast tacos!"}
{"text":"Came here without reservations as we were staying around the area and wanted to check this spot out. I loved that it was around a bunch of stores and shops too because we got to roam around until we got our text that the table was ready. Service was extremely friendly and helpful when we had to decide on what to order. My boyfriend and I had the Benny Duo (where I got to choose two different Benedict's so I didn't have to just choose one) and the Pancake Flight (3 pancake choices from the menu).

My Benny Duo consists of the Benny Goodman (Salmon) and the Bella (prosciutto) - I liked the salmon better as the prosciutto was a little too salty for me. The signature English muffin was at the perfect crisp when we ate it and not soggy (usually the hollandaise sauce makes my muffin less crispy).  The house hash browns were also magnificent! I highly suggest to get.

The Pancake Flight my boyfriend chose consisted of pineapple upside down pancake, blueberry, and the pancake of the day: Caramel. I personally liked the pineapple one best of the three. Super filling and definitely a good option if you can't decide on one pancake.

Portions are good, service was fast and great. Worth checking out :)"}
{"text":"I stop by for breakfast every time I'm in Scottsdale Arizona couldn't be more pleased with the food or service. Love the food and coffee!"}
{"text":"Friendly local place and then I recalled that we ate at a Snooze in Denver recently.  Nonetheless, the food is solid and delicious in flavor.  I ordered the corned beef hash l, which had amazing flavors and was quite lean.  The side of a sweet potato pancake, just brought out the savory / sweet combination together.  The Benny really was well executed and a must if you enjoy arugula , balsamic reduction & Italian flair.  Thanks Snooze for another great experience"}
{"text":"Delicious meal for a reasonable price. Our server Hannah was amazing as well. Overall a great experience and we will be back."}
{"text":"My mom and I split the OMG French toast & the Spring Benny. Both were DELICIOUS. I loved the quinoa patty underneath the poached egg. The French toast was crispy but soft which was the perfect combination. The sauce was definitely the best part of the french toast. So so good, will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Delicious and affordable. Busy but got us sat and served quickly for how busy they were. Best eggs Benedict I have ever had in my life. Great place can't wait to try the one in my home town now!"}
{"text":"Get the B.E.A.T. Sandwich with a fried egg in it! Best breakfast I've ever had!! And their hash browns are amazing!!!!!"}
{"text":"If I could give this two separate reviews, I would. The service and the food are outstanding. Austin was one recent server who did a beautiful job with his service. Friendly and efficient - what more can you ask? That seems to be rapidly disappearing in Scottsdale, and lots of other places. The egg dishes are good. I especially like the \"make your own\" scrambles and the breakfast tacos. The pancakes are delicious, but really rich, almost like dessert. So, we always share. Now the not great part. This place needs to redo their check-in procedure. There is only one door, and it is always JAM PACKED! People trying to get their name on the list, the servers, and people trying to check in when their table is ready are all clogging the door. There is nowhere to wait for your table. Last time we were there, it took us almost five minutes just to check in when we had been texted that our table was ready as we could not get through the crush of people clogging the door. Another reviewer said the parking lot gives her anxiety - the doorway gives me anxiety. They need to have people check in outdoors or something. That door is agony. Once inside, the tables are ridiculously close together. The people at the other tables are so close, it is hard to have a normal conversation with your dining partner. But the food and service are fantastic."}
{"text":"The Havana breakfast sandwich is absolutely amazing. Nuts basically an open face cubano with hollandaise and Dijon mustard, mouthwatering! The hash brown patty is really good, crispy on the outside.  You can order the hash browns regular style if you prefer them to be crispy throughout.  A definite win in my book for breakfast.  Be prepared for a long wait though!"}
{"text":"Today I was really stressed because my baby girl boxer had to have some tests done and so I went to snooze while waiting for her and the bartender was really friendly and provided wonderful service, not to mention made a terrific Bloody Mary to calm my nerves a bit. I left there full and feeling better about things. My sweet girls test results were all good as well. All in all good day, but thanks to (I wish I knew her name) the blonde bartender with a kind voice and nice smile who kicked off my day a little better :)"}
{"text":"Super disappointed in Snooze, an A.M. Eatery. Gluten free dairy free restrictions EVERYTHING a la cart.. $2 for 2 mini slivers of an avocado. Over an hour wait, I will NEVER go back. Too many excellent places to eat in Scottsdale. And I think the restaurants that take advantage dietary restrictions should be ashamed of themselves!"}
{"text":"the biscuits and gravy were the best I have even had. It was like a puff pastry, it was rich and amazing and I would suggest sharing. The mimosa's were a generous size making it a fun atmosphere to enjoy on a Sat or Sun. brunch"}
{"text":"Without a doubt, this is the place for creative breakfasts! My latest crave is their Late Harvest Benedict ! The flavors are spot on, eggs cooked to perfection, healthy 
Breakfast... this all coming from an ex B&B owner... enough said!"}
{"text":"Yummy food and such a fun atmosphere! I have eaten at Snooze in Denver and in Scottsdale and have had a wonderful experience each time. The retro look and bright colors make breakfast or brunch so fun. There are so many unique choices, and everything I have tried is delicious.

My friend and I could decide between sweet and savory so we ordered one of each and shared. Our server recommended the Bella Bella Benny and we both loved it. Their hash brown potatoes are also amazing. For sweet we ordered the pancake flight and shared sweet potato, peanut butter cup and pineapple upside down pancakes. All were delicious and just the right size. 

Yummy coffee. They also have a menu of boozy breakfast drinks. Can be busy but I like how they'll take your number and text you when your table is ready so you can stroll around the shops and come back when your table is ready. Yum!"}
{"text":"I'd never give this place a less than stellar review having had two really good experiences here before, but I do have some helpful suggestions for both customers and staff after a recent attempt to visit. We brought my mom here on an early brunch/lunch break and were told the wait was 10-15 minutes. About 40 minutes later, we were still being told that several tables of customers were finished but still just hanging back and chatting and there wasn't anything that could be done for us. We ultimately had to go to Chloe's Corner for something quick, wishing we could have that wait time back for the sake of little remaining time together, though we'd made the trip to Kierland for Snooze and were assured it would be any minute for a while. During our wait, we overheard and saw a hostess arrange the system and a table our size for who appeared to be her friends who came in a while after us, which was a bummer, but they did have a little girl with them so we were forgiving of being questionably cut ahead of like that. We figured we'd also be seated shortly, but it eventually meant we would never get a table.

It is such bad etiquette on customers' behalves to hang back and \"snooze\" when your servers have a living to earn, and other people might want to eat a new/popular restaurant, too. I think there are polite remedies that could be better implemented to avoid losing business and no longer seeming very appealing as an option for future visits, with the current gamble of a wait time structured to accommodate finished, lingering customers better than new ones. Collect the final bills back and clear the tables completely, asking if there's anything else that they need today, and thank them for coming in. Or, politely inform customers who have been paid up for a while that there's ample space at the bar since other parties have been experiencing unusually long waits for tables today, rather than sending those who have been waiting for tables there or in the current blazing heat to eat as a family. Everyone is so friendly there, I don't see that being offensive at all, but what was a little offensive was being given a very short wait time initially and ultimately having to be turned away after all. I felt like perhaps more could have been done, and maybe would have if we weren't very easygoing people. I'm not knocking the restaurant so much as inconsiderate customers who are overly taking advantage of the laid back atmosphere, but from a business and customer service perspective, surely something more should begin to be done better in these cases after what we experienced today. For a place that closes at 2:30, that's a huge discouragement for future visits for individuals who don't have hours to kill, or don't wish to be unpleasantly surprised by the lack of availability for them after all, after waiting long periods of time only to be told, \"sorry.\" I'd imagine this could become a big problem as our population increases in cooler months with customers less likely to bite their tongues, and that's a shame because the staff typically could not be nicer. Service has been wonderful when the wait wasn't an issue in the past, with exceptional wait staff and food. But please be more proactive about finished, overly chatty tables, who have hopefully already had a satisfying experience so that others may enjoy the same that day. Starbucks is right next door for those who want to stake claim of an empty table for hours for free!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place.  Expect to wait an hour for a table.  We really enjoyed the pancake options.  Really good food, but you have to have the time to commit to the wait."}
{"text":"I loved my dish here, but this is your typical, chain breakfast restaurant. I had the veggie benedict and loved the other benedict options. The coffee was just okay and the service didn't blow me away, but I don't have any complaints.  I'll choose a local, non-chain over this place if given the choice again."}
{"text":"For 1 its not worth the wait. 2, apparently everyone is a manager here but cant seem to help you with a complaint. 3, \"head chef\" cant even handle proper complaints correctly. Tells you theres nothing he can do and walks away. What a proper way to handle situations. Only thing i like about this place is the pancakes. THATS IT. Everything else is gross and needs more flavoring and staff needs training because they suck at their job. And guess what? Yelp reviews are their top priority. Be nice to EVERYONE not who you feel you need to be nice to."}
{"text":"I came here early on a Thursday morning to meet up with a friend. Never been here before. Seen it in Tempe and in the Kierland Commons so I was really looking forward to this. 

Got here right when it opened at 6:30am and was actually greeted right away. We even got to pick our own table. Very interesting place. Very bright and colorful with both indoor and outdoor seating. They have garage door to open the place up to give it that open air feeling. We got an indoor/outdoor booth so you get the best of both worlds. Hahaha

The hostess was very friendly even at this time of the morning. Our waitress came and got our drink orders right away. 

I ordered the breakfast pot pie. Saw this on Yelp and knew I had to try this. I always try and experience something different. Something special related to the place. It had a flaky thick crust and very light with a sausage gravy that had carrots and celery and an eggs on top. This was really good. Reminded me of biscuit and gravy. Gravy had a little kick. Not much but maybe it's more like a shove than a kick. Hahaha. It's came with Hash browns. They make it into a round circle and pretty thick. Lot different than most breakfast joints. I like it. It was good. I would say not a bad breakfast. Not great but very good. 

The service was excellent. Of course they weren't too busy at this time of the morning but our waitress even had a sense of humor this early in the morning. Love that in a waitress. She always watched us and kept our coffee cups filled. Checked on us. So I was really happy with the service. 

So overall I thought this was a really good breakfast. Really nice ambience, good food, great service. I know they weren't busy but didn't rush us out or anything. Really enjoyed the time at Snooze. 

Will I be back? Of course I will. Enjoy cause I sure did."}
{"text":"I love this place. I usually get the flight pancakes so I can get 3 different pancakes. My favorite pancake is the upside down pineapple. Sweet potato is pretty good too. I've had the chaquillas, they were very good. I had the sammie in a pretzel bun. It was good, eggs were a bit greasy though as I got egg whites. All their eggs Benedict are great!  I like how you can go next door and have coffee while you wait for a table. They let you bring your Starbucks in. You can also shop while you wait for a table. They text you when your table is ready."}
{"text":"I gave this a 3 not because of the food - it's a wonderful breakfast spot - I have enjoyed everything I have tried - but the service is not consistent- it's either slow - our order was not put in once and we've received COLD food.  I'll go again but I won't rush back - I have to many places that I enjoy to take a chance on So So service!"}
{"text":"This hands down is the best place in town for gluten free pancakes. I love that they offer a flight of pancakes that are gluten free. Of course if you want the gluten they have that too. It's just unexpected to have a variety of gluten free pancakes in a breakfast place. It's perfect for this gluten sensitivity girl. The flight of pancakes is like dessert and so worth the indulgence. 

Other items I love here are the fresh Orange Juice, the Bloody Mary which has the perfect amount of spice. They also have a decent list of other alcoholic drinks that are interesting all infused with something curious. I also love the breakfast tacos which you can get on corn or flour. They are super tasty but I like to get them without the potato shreds simply because it is too filling especially if you are getting the flight of pancakes as well. They also offer some interesting and creative spins on Benny's which all look delicious. This is one of my top 3 places in town for breakfast. They don't take reservations and on the weekends there is always about a 20 mins wait. Good news there is a Starbucks right next store so you can grab a latte while you wait. 

Totally worth the trip and the wait!"}
{"text":"This place is great for breakfast/brunch. We had our Mother's Day brunch here and we loved every second of it! We started with a trio of french toast, lemon poppy seed pancakes, and some sort of sweet potato and pecan deliciousness picked out by our server Hannah. Hannah by the way was one of the best waitresses I've ever had, great personality and and making sure we had everything we needed. I made an obnoxious order and it came out perfect. Eggs Benedict with avocado and chicken sausage and side of yummy fruit ( with actual berries, not just melon).  Others had breakfast tacos, corned beef hash, Huevos rancheros, and quinoa Benedict. I've been here multiple times and will continue to come back!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is great. Service is good too. But I have to take one star off because last two times I was here the server seems to be in rush and did not have patience to answer any simple question either. I hate rushing me on a Sunday morning when I am for a nice relaxed brunch. The whole experience becomes irritating. Snooze, if you're reading then fix it.  

Update: I asked for straws and the guy comes and throws this on the table and expects us to use them. But the corn beef hash is just too good."}
{"text":"The most incredible pancakes I've ever eaten they are absolutely huge and they do have healthy stuff on the menu to"}
{"text":"QUICKLY!!!  Go to Snooze and order pancakes!! The sweet potato pancakes are like heaven on earth!  The staff is friendly and attentive. Such a pleasant experience. GO!! HURRY!!!"}
{"text":"This is the spot to go if you ever in Scottsdale. I wanted to eat everything off the menu. I went with my fiancee to this establishment everyone was very friendly and the service was top notch. The mimosa were so worth it you only need one to get a tipsy."}
{"text":"The food is great.  The vibe is awesome.  Like the bartender/waitress said, some places are quiet for breakfast, this place is like WAKE UP!  I will be back soon."}
{"text":"Snooze is amazing! The breakfast tacos are great but the pancakes have you licking your lips when you get home! This is my cheat breakfast at any given time!! I can't recommend just one thing because I've been impressed with everything.."}
{"text":"My go to brunch place on the weekends, the service is always great! Their coffee is amazing and I love the cinnamon bun pancake. I've never had a bad meal or experience here."}
{"text":"Snooze is one of my top breakfast & brunch joints!

Wait time can be anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour, so show up early or plan to wait! Once you're finally seated service is prompt and courteous. A manager occasionally walks around to make sure all patrons are satisfied and I like that.

I would describe Snooze as having a creative menu. They have an \"ahh la carte\" section for those that can't ever make up their mind about something and want to pick individual items (try the pancakes!). As a bloody mary fan, I have to say that this place has a  mean bloody mary! 

Snooze has a very good breakfast sandwich that comes on a pretzel bun and it's just so good. 

The restaurant has a very interesting interior design that has a very trendy hipster feel. I will say that the seating here can be a little intimidating at first. They have booths that seat a total of four people but they are sectioned off to sit a total of two people. It almost feels like you're sharing a booth with someone else with a small divider in the middle, but don't worry, it feels normal quickly. 

Snooze is definitely a local favorite for a lot of people, so don't pass it up!"}
{"text":"The eggs benny are so good I have eaten here the past 3 mornings.
Good service, great food and easy parking outside."}
{"text":"What a great restaurant here in Scottsdale for breakfast you'll not forget soon come to Snooze. Thanks to our great hostess Ivy and server \"Cray Cray\" we had a wonderful meal and a wonderful time. The pancakes were to die for and my OMG French toast was delish."}
{"text":"Visiting for a few days, and I wanted to find a good breakfast place...so I followed Yelp reviews here. 

The menu has a large \"syrup breakfast\" and \"Benedict\" offering. Less variety in the egg realm. I ordered corned beef hash with poached eggs, rye toast and black coffee.

The good: coffee was excellent; hash very nicely prepared, with nice chunks of corned beef and nice flavoring; toast was perfect; service was friendly and attentive from the moment I walked in. 

The disappointing:  serving of corned beef hash was on the small side, which I didn't expect for the price. 

This place is unusual for a breakfast restaurant in that it has a full bar(!). Hope I'm never in the mood. Also a bit of a sports bar vibe on that side of the restaurant. The decor is sort of 70's throw back--or something--with bright colors and flower prints. 

I'll probably be back but I'm tempted to try somewhere else tomorrow..."}
{"text":"Everything here was perfect this morning ! The bar had a seat open and I strolled on in, the wait stuff seated me right away and got me my coffee and water.


The food was the best, they suggested the eggs Benedict and allowed me to mix and match the of the most unique eggs Benedict I'd ever had. One seemed like a bruschetta almost and the other had a definitely tex-mex feel to it.

All throughout the breakfast the staff consistently checked in and made sure I was well topped off. Will definitely recommend this to anyone around he area hungry for breakfast ."}
{"text":"Visited Scottsdale for a few days and ate at Snooze two times. Reasonably priced, great food, right next to a Starbucks in Kierland Commons. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Delicious! I've been wanting to try this place out for a while now, even in another state, but it's always completely packed no matter what time you show up. But it's worth the wait. I got in this past weekend with my date and we got the pomegranate something mimosas, our waitress let us have a free upside down pineapple pancake which was amazing, I got the French toast that was to die for, and my date got a couple of the benedicts. I highly recommend this place. Just wish the wait times weren't so long!"}
{"text":"I do like this breakfast/lunch place, however be prepared to hang around to wait for your table (or go for the bar area for faster seating).  The oracle is modern, fresh and bright.  With the fall coming sitting outside is more comfortable too, which opens up the options, but in order to cut down the up to 45 or so minutes wait people do sit out in the 110+ heat with the misters blasting away.  

I like that they take your cell number and text you when your table is ready, so at least you can wander around the center to kill time.

T is worth it though.  They make good benedicts, nice omelettes and offer some unusual alternatives too.  If you haven't tried it, you are missing out.

Enjoy....."}
{"text":"What a find!  We just love this place!  The food is so yummy, but the service we were provided by Hannah and Lila (on 2 different visits) was the best. These young women are attentive, bubbly, eager to please and so personable!  They are the best servers we've had in any restaurant!

Give this place a try for breakfast. You'll be glad you did!  Be sure to ask for Hannah and Lila!"}
{"text":"Busy place, be prepared to wait on the weekend.  Service was great, even the morning after St. Patty's day!!!  Food was fresh and delicious, you can get your standard breakfast items or try one of their unique concoctions.  My daughter loved the Nana's Hot Chocolate Pancakes - see the pic - that is a giant toasted marshmallow on top that melts when you pour the hot chocolate  syrup over it.  My wife and I tried the breakfast pot pie.  It was different with the puff pastry, but good.  Probably would go with something different next time."}
{"text":"The service was great but we were highly disappointed in the food. Never in my life have I had flavorless bacon. That shouldn't be a thing. The four of us each a strip of bacon and couldn't believe it didn't taste like anything. This restaurant was just ok. Wouldn't necessarily go back."}
{"text":"The food is great, but the service we received from Jordan was spectacular! She was attentive, friendly, informative and most importantly, a genuinely great person! Every time I return I'll ask to sit in her section. Jordan you're awesome! You made a birthday that much more special."}
{"text":"The wait time was ridiculous!  We got there at 10. We were finished 12:30. The food was good but the service was something that needs a lot of work. I did not think there was enough wait staff because we where looking at 7 empty tables and no one was being seated. It will be a while before we go back."}
{"text":"I love Snooze! My favorite breakfast place by far.... their pancakes are great and I'm usually not a fan of pancakes but I am here! I've tried a lot on their menu, so really you can't go wrong with what you order. Feels like a real breakfast place and their staff is super friendly too :)

P.s. try the Blueberry Danish Pancakes (w/ Graham crackers on top!)"}
{"text":"The \"mo heat o\" was outstanding! We had the tacos with 3 different types of meat, the bacon egg sandwich and sweet potatoe pancake everything was delicious!!!! Service was wonderful too"}
{"text":"So glad we went here for breakfast.. the options are over the top, it was way cheaper then eating at the hotel and breakfast went till 2:30pm so no need to rush.. parking was super easy..
We got seats at the bar."}
{"text":"Cool new place during my usual visit to my old stomping grounds. I appreciated their unique menu, creativity is key when you open a new business establishment. Needless to say my food with made to order, because I'm so picky... I would come here again, and when I do I will sit at the bar. I really suggest sitting at the bar because the coffee-bar-tender was very personable, funny, educational and just amazing! Thank you."}
{"text":"Great food , fast, and friendly.  The staff here seem to really love each other and that flows over to great service to the guest. I had an AM old fashion. It was good. The Juan tacos were fabulous. Their menu also shows their passion for community and sustainability.  I tasted a salad that was great, and I tasted gluten free pancakes that were amazing."}
{"text":"I would recommend coming earlier to avoid the wait, thankfully we only had to wait 20 minutes before being seated inside. 

We ordered the Pineapple Upside Down Pancake, Ham Benedict III as well as the Pancake Flight which included the Sweet Potato Pancake, Blueberry Pancake and the Coffee and Donut Pancake. 

A perfectly poached egg with thick cut bacon (a substitute for ham) came out of the kitchen covered in a flavourful smoked cheddar hollandaise. The Benedict was extremely rich and I was thankful to have some hash brown to break it up between the bites - but the hash browns were not that great, less like a hash brown more like hash brown mash. 

Now onto their light and fluffy pancakes...the speciality pancakes, the \"sweet utopia\", were hit and miss. The Sweet Potato was nothing to write home about; the Blueberry was just a normal pancake with blueberry topping; the Coffee and Donuts was left uneaten after a bite. However, the Pineapple Upside Down Pancake was unbelievably decadent. My first bite and my eyes went wide in delight - could not get enough.

In the end, I would come again if only for the Pineapple Upside Down Pancake. As one person in a review before me said, \"If you don't Snooze, you lose.\""}
{"text":"I always have an awesome experience when I visit here. The breakfast burrito with a side of bacon (the best!) is my go-to. The staff is always friendly and I love the vibe inside and outside. The wait times can be long on the weekends, but it is worth the wait. I wish they would allow for call ahead seating or use the No Wait app like their other locations."}
{"text":"Terrible Service!!  
Sat at a table for 15 minutes and not one staff member acknowledged us, no hello, no water, no nothing.  Completely disorganized and rude!  First Watch is our first choice, will be going there for now on."}
{"text":"Holy cow, went there for breakfast this morning and WAS. NOT. DISAPPOINTED!!  Place was a little busy, as expected on a holiday weekend, but was well worth the wait. Staff was extremely friendly, and the food was top notch. Probably ate more than I should, but I just couldn't stop. Bella Bella Benny and a pancake flight...it was well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"You snooze, you lose. That is so not true!   

Located @ Kierland Commons, Snooze, an A.M Eatery serves delicious breakfast meals. 

The hostess took our cell # and texted us when the table was ready. 

Corned beef hash with Nana's hot cocoa pancake ($10.75): the hash had a very good flavor, but was slightly too greasy. The hot cocoa pancake was rich and delicious. The pancake was served with the best marshmallow ever. I tasted candied ginger. It was so good that I actually asked for extra marshmallows.

Breakfast pot pie with pineapple upside down pancake ($9.75): the vanilla syrup was so good. I hate vanilla and I like their vanilla liquid gold. The airy puff pastry was topped with delicious gravy. The top was crispy and the maple syrup was light and not too sweet. 

Our waitress, Jordan, was sweet, great, helpful and fast. 

It was like a slumber party there. The workers dressed in PJ bottoms. 

5 stars!! I am pretty sure those two pancakes are my favorite pancakes ever so far. 

Snooze, an A.M. Eatery is yummylicious!!"}
{"text":"Food is OK. But overpriced. Service staff is clearly not hired for quality of work. If you're in Kierland it's a good meal for breakfast. But if you're in your car. Perk is right down the street as well as the breakfast Joynt. Both better options."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place for breakfast/brunch!  The OMG French toast is to die for. My husband had the shrimp and grits and pronounced it perfect. A five-star review also goes to our server, Hannah. She was so friendly , efficient, and knowledgeable that we know we'll be back soon and ask for her table. You can't beat Snooze for food and fun."}
{"text":"Authentic, great service, tasty, not just your average breakfast joint. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Coffee was very good. I got the Benedict duo. The  Chile verde Benedict was fantastic. The Bella Bella benny was not my cup of tea. It would have been fantastic if it weren't for the excess of balsamic that drenched the bread and threw off the flavor. My husband tried a bite and called it foul, I certainly wouldn't go that far but I wouldn't order that again. My kids got the pancake flight with. Blueberry, pumpkin &  pineapple upside down. They were al awesome. My son got the kids French toast and it was good. My other daughter got a pumpkin pancake and my husband had scrambled eggs. We all loved that they serve real maple syrup. The hashbrowns were a little mushy for me but had good flavor. Orange juice seems fresh and was very good. Service was prompt and friendly and the place was very clean. The morning cocktails looked great but we didn't get a chance to try them this time around. Will definitely plan for that in the future."}
{"text":"I have never had breakfast tacos before and now it is the only way I want to eat breakfast. This place is incredible and changed my mind about morning meals. Wait is a little long but worth it."}
{"text":"The hostesses at the front are sweet girls who are always smiling and welcoming us when we arrive.  They remember us, our names, they're amazing ambassadors for Snooze, and they make us feel special.  The same can be said for everyone actually- the management, waiters/waitresses, kitchen staff, and bussers.  All deserve raises in our opinion, regardless of what they're paid.  The food is amazing.  The environment is clean and well kept.  Good for Snooze, I just found the place a week or so ago and I've already taken my sister, mom, wife, best friend etc.  If you're a French toast fan like me, try the French toast neat, and OMG French toast.. :)  In my opinion customer service today is largely dead.  This place is certainly a cut above and on point in every area.  I'm hard to please and I have high expectations- bravo Snooze.  The only thing I worry about is people who have their expectations set too high by these reviews- no one is perfect, it's a breakfast place- but surely the best breakfast place in town."}
{"text":"Great food!  This place is very popular and it was very apparent when we went.  The atmosphere is fresh and the they've really put some thought into common breakfast offering. Tried the pancake flight (highly recommended) and the Chilciles Benedict.  Traveled all the way from the East Valley to experience and can't wait till the newest one opens in Ahwatukee."}
{"text":"We saw this restaurant in CA but the wait was over a hour. So I knew it must be good. Man it was still a 30 min wait but oh wow. The sweet potato pancake with Chorizo was so flipping yummy."}
{"text":"I first visited shortly after they opened. Initially I was pleased but not blown away. I tried again and they exceeded my expectations. 

I had the BEAT sandwich. Fresh and flavorful - the portion was great!

Good coffee and excellent service. With so many excellent options for breakfast within one mile, I can definitely say I will be back here again."}
{"text":"Probably one of the tastiest breakfasts I've ever had. Everything we had tasted amazing! We had a pancake flight with the pumpkin, blueberry and the sweet potato options. Our favorite was the sweet potato and our least favorite (though still really good) was the blueberry.  From the reviews I see now I wish we tried the pineapple upside down pancake instead of the blueberry! We also had the corned beef hash and the chilaquiles Benedict and coffee which were excellent as well! The only thing we didn't like was the 40 minute wait to get a table."}
{"text":"Service was amazing, food came out quickly and was cooked exactly the way I ordered it. 
Forsure one of my favorite places to break the fast!

My only complaint would be that there is almost always a wait... but what do you expect with a great breakfast spot?  So show up before your super hungry or \"Hangry\" as my wife calls it."}
{"text":"My co-workers and I went there today for lunch and we could not have had a more pleasant experience!!! From the moment we walked in the Hostess made us feel like family! The waitress Cray was so funny and sweet, our food came out hot, delicious and in a timely manner! This will now be our go-to place for lunch!! We all got a different egg dish and then ordered one of their amazing pancakes (The Pineapple Upside Down Pancake) to share!!! OMG!!! So good!!!! And my boss is a vegetarian and they have faux meat!! I definitely recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome breakfast. My wife ordered the corn beef hash...said it was the best she ever had. I ordered the breakfast tacos...muy delicioso...asked for hot sauce .....but never used as they had this half lime cut dusted with chili spices that you squeeze on your tacos...really great ....no need for the cholula sauce!
Also suggest a spicy Bloody Mary to go with your breakfast.....perfect!!!"}
{"text":"I love Snooze! They have a great selection of mimosa flavors. I've only ever had hollandaise here, and I haven't tried it anywhere else because I'm afraid I won't like it. Great brunch spot with your girlfriends"}
{"text":"I've always loved the menu and food at Snooze, but on many occasions I've been disappointed with the service. My most recent visit proved the best. Go see Joshua at the bar! He was attentive and friendly, he made the best latte just the way I asked, and the food was awesome (as always). If it's just me or me and one other person I'll always be checking to see if the bar is open and Joshua is working!"}
{"text":"First off, everything on the menu can be made gluten free besides two things!! Second, there's so many options, and fun flavors for pancakes that go beyond just chocolate chip and blueberry. Third, the servers/workers seem genuinely happy to help and friendly. One of my new favorite spots if you're looking for sweet and savory breakfast options!"}
{"text":"Wow what a disappointment  we were really looking forward to coming here after seeing them featured on channel 3 news we went Sunday after church  the first thing notices was the age of patrons all appeared to be young adults, we all 
Loved how they notify you your table is ready via text message great way to use technology. The menu was impressive BUT the meal failed to impress miserably 
!!!! We had spicy  Bloody Mary's worst ever then ordered Benny's for breakfast and We all were at first thought not to bad but bite after bite we where let down. Bonus the meal talked to us all afternoon 
Would not recommend this Resturant"}
{"text":"I love this place. Every time I come I get top service and food. My sister and I sat on the patio and were served immediately. We both ordered the hot chocolate which was great! I ordered my favorite the Eggs Benedict. They didn't miss a beat."}
{"text":"This place is fun, hip and has a great staff.  Make sure to get the pancake flight so you can try a few.  Ask for the cinnamon roll pancake (not on the menu)."}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast/brunch places. Pancakes are fantastic, and my favorite item on the menu is the Pot Pie. And I love getting my hash browns flat and crispy. Delicious!!

Super busy place, get there early if you can! Friendly front staff and wait staff - food is brought out in a timely manner, and the wait staff is attentive. 

This is always on my list of breakfast places with girlfriends or with the family!"}
{"text":"So happy to have a Snooze in North Scottsdale! Our server Angelo made excellent recommendations and was very outgoing and energetic. Food was amazing as always, if you like Eggs Benedict they have a great selection.. Start with a pancake (try the sweet potato) as an appetizer because you will not have room afterwards. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Love this place! My favorite is the pineapple upside down pancakes... yum! Definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"Overrated. 
Been there twice. Both times had Eggs Benedict. 
Both times I asked for the eggs to be poached easy. 
Guess what?  Both times the poached eggs came out practically hard boiled. 
Also, the food isn't served very hot. 
Shouldn't  a breakfast place know how to poach an egg?"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Delicious food and really fun environment!! We will be back!! Kylee & Amber served us & had beautiful smiles and positive energy!!"}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast places around. I went to the original back in Denver when they first opened with lines around the door. Only reason I am not 5 starring is because I feel they have commercialized too much. I see them all over the place now and they don't ever change the menu. I wish they would show more of the innovation that made them originally successful."}
{"text":"Is every restaurant a chain in Scottsdale??!

Decided to eat here thinking it was an original... Only to realize I had Snooze bookmarked in San Diego, LOL

Anyways. The wait was over an hour for a party of 4 on a Sunday. But they take your phone number so we walked across the street trying to make it to a store... Only to be texted after 20 minutes that our table was ready...

Menu is great, so many options, took forever to decide. Ended up with pancake sampler, barbacoa Benedict, and breakfast burrito.

My hubs loved the pancakes, I resisted trying them.

My hubs is a slow eater and he completely destroyed the Benedict in a matter of seconds. He loved it. And I loved the little hash brown cake, I couldn't stop eating them, I don't know why they tasted so good. My kid loved them too and she usually doesn't go for hash browns.

Burrito with housemade chicken sausage was very good, I am not a fan of salsa verde and theirs was very good! 

I regret not trying one of their fun takes on a mimosa. I'm surprised they have such a full bar for a restaurant that is only open till lunch. 

I will be back.

Please open one in Tucson, Thanks."}
{"text":"I had their Classic breakfast that included 3  eggs (cooked perfectly), hash brown (fresh, not frozen) and bacon.   The toast was cold and not buttered (I had asked for butter).  A side pancake (cinnamon bun flavor) was too sweet to eat.  However, the wonderful spicy bloody mary made it all OK, lol!

I'll certainly go back.  Service was great even though they were very busy.  A great place for brrakfast in Kierland."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out based on Yelp reviews. Hubby had french toast and said it was good. My huevos rancheros were cold. Sent back and reordered same dish. Still not hot. Manager checked in and comped my meal which was nice. Will give them another try, but probably not the same dish."}
{"text":"Went there for brunch with my girl friends as the reviews looked great. What a huge disappointment. First of all, their most popular drink - a summer breeze peach basil drink was a fermented sour disaster. My friend had two different kinds of Bloody Marie's and both were watered down, lame excuses for what they weren't meant to be. Food was equally disappointing in presentation and flavor! Don't plan to ever come back!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend breakfast or brunch at Snooze. Service and food was great. We checked it out due to the many other great reviews. The breakfast pot pie is awesome! Went around 9:30 during the week pretty busy but we didn't have to wait for a table."}
{"text":"So glad to find a new brunch spot! The menu has a lot of great traditional and creative breakfast items. I look forward to trying out this place for lunch.

The whole restaurant is very clean, the staff is friendly, and the food is great."}
{"text":"Be prepared to wait! Don't get an attitude- it's worth it! Yummy Benedict's! Had the Harvest & Chilichelies and they were both awesome! If you like crispy hash browns - this is your place. Danielle aka Snowflake, our waitress was efficient & friendly!"}
{"text":"Snooze has delicious pancakes, on point breakfast sandwiches, and friendly servers. I only wish the wait was a little less. Come here on the weekend and expect a 45 minute wait at least... But well worth your time. Prices also very reasonable."}
{"text":"I go here way too often. They are absolutely amazing. Great coffee, benedicts, and pancakes. I have never had anything but an excellent meal, wonderful service, and would highly recommend this place to anyone. There is also a location on Camelback which is great as well.  In particular, I advise you to get the Bella Bella Benny or the Late Harvest Benny... the pineapple upside-down pancake is fantastic as well. Be sure to ask about the pancake of the day when you go."}
{"text":"Really good food and pet friendly. Customer service A+. This places is located in a nice area with shopping. If your not from the area stop here for s bite."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, great people, amazing location. Simple and sweet . Walked in and was greated by hostess , was very friendly and told us it would be 20 minutes got our number and would send the text when the table is ready. Luckily its right next to some  shops so we shopped around a bit and next thing we know its been 20 minute's. Waitress was lovely and promptly got our drinks and food put in. I ordered the Benny Duo, half of the Bella Bella Benny and the chile Benny! Friend got The Snooze Classic. The food was great! Fresh yummy and simple and classic flavors mixed with new and exotic hints and tastes as well!. Reasonable price as well, will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the lox, house made hash browns and the Farm fresh raised eggs! Fun refreshing atmosphere and very kid friendly. Great brunch spot for family or a girls brunch! Drinks are stout and also very cheap! I didn't try anything from the back page but, I wish I had I saw it and it looked really good. Service wasn't the fastest.... Even though we came on a Monday around lunch and I think we caught them on an off day because our service was kinda snappy also they don't do iced coffee? Or we were told... But, I will return as I like the location and quality of food."}
{"text":"Before visiting this location, I had only been to the original Snooze (several times) in Denver. When I discovered this location in Scottsdale, I hoped that it would be just as good as the original- and it did not disappoint! I love the plethora of unique and creative options. Personally, as someone with a huge sweet tooth, I especially love their creative variety of pancakes. Our server graced us with great conversation without being overbearing and checking by too often. I plan to visit again soon! You're safe recommending this one to friends and family."}
{"text":"We went crazy for Cray Cray she was amazing! The girls and I had an amazing breakfast! Great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Great menu.  Great decor. Great service.  Corn beef hash is truly \"signature\" and the granola dish was also very delicious.  Never would have ordered it, but the free upside down pineapple pancake was surprisingly good. This place is a winner."}
{"text":"The first time I had snooze cafe I got the pineapple upside down pancake it was incredible as delicious as it sounds it was I think people should really try it it was amazing .     And the second time I went to snooze I got the breakfast pot pie it was amazing every good adjective u could think of every one has to try this its so good."}
{"text":"Awesome food flavorful, fresh and just the right amount! Asked for a handful of spinach for my eggs.....no problem! I really recommend this place!! The bacon is amazing, not greasy at all!
Loved my meal?"}
{"text":"The Benny Goodman Benedict is the best breakfast I have had in years. The rye toast is the perfect accompaniment to this meal. I was worried when i read sundried tomato and caper relish. Not at all. It actually tasted like a tomato instead of the 1990s. Lox, creams cheese hollandaise, and poached eggs...uh yes please. Rye bread...forget about it. A perfect, perfect, perfect breakfast."}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast this morning. Service was good and the portions were ample. Really like the chicken sausage (patty) as an alternative to bacon."}
{"text":"We wanted to try this place out after we saw it being built. I was scared because I was with my mother and my ever so picky aunt. We call her Mrs. special order. The morning we went there was a relatively long wait but the staff made us as comfortable as possible even though it felt like 200¬∞ outside. The waiter was extremely accommodating with the special request my aunt had an even made a couple changes on my breakfast order. I'm telling you a breakfast sandwich on a pretzel bun is to die for. I should've asked if they thought those pretzel buns to go because I can't imagine much being bad on them. Service was really fast and when the manager came over and checked on us I truly felt they were wanting to make sure we are having a great time and not doing the stereo typical drive by table touch which is often annoying and robotic.
This place like I said gets pretty busy on weekend mornings make sure if you're coming here you plan ahead so you're not waiting as long as we did.
However in the right whether I would wait hours for more of that pretzel bun"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have a tradition of going out for brunch every Sunday morning and lately we have been going to the same 2 places nearby our house but this morning we decided to branch out and try something new...and I am So glad we did!
Upon arriving at Snooze, there was no parking to be found and the wait to be seated was 45-60 min!! Normally we would never wait this long for breakfast it since the restaurant is conveniently located in Kierland, we didn't mind shopping around to kill time.
Once we were seated, everything in the menu looked delicious! The tables inside and out are super close together so we heard every word of the conversation at the table next to us. Other than that, the waitress was very friendly and attentive and the food came out in an average time. 
My boyfriend raved about the chocolate milk, as he is a huge chocolate milk fan! We both got the pancake trio, so we got to try 6 different kinds of pancakes and they were Phenomenal! Definitely the best pancakes we have ever had! We will be back for sure (except we will try to come on a weekday morning in the future to avoid the wait)! Yummmmyyyyy!!!"}
{"text":"Great selection of coffee beverages and the food was excellent. The staff was friendly and food came out quick. The patio offered spacious seating and if you want get work done after, Starbucks is right next door. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The waitress recommendations were spot on. The food was delicious, service was good, and they were quick. I went at 8:30am and was seated within 10 minutes. My only complaint is that I ate too much!"}
{"text":"Good food. Friendly service. A little pricey. One little piece of avocado was a $2 up charge. It was maybe a fifth of a full avocado. I got the breakfast tacos. If I was rich, I'd eat here every day."}
{"text":"I want to eat here every meal, every day, until I try it all, and then repeat. GOOGLY HEART EYES x A BILLION. Never had eggs Benedict before so I got the Benny Duo; Benny Goodman was to die for, love me some salmon, Early Harvest was just okay. My boyfriend had the Huevos Rancheros with soyrizo (he's the sweetest carnivore ever, don't worry he got his side of bacon). He loved it, meatless and all! We also shared the pancake flight which, HOLY HELL PANCAKE FLIGHT GUYS! Get the sweet potato pancakes FO SHO. Also, drink all the drinks. Spicy Bloody for the win and Shamus had the Dirty Drunken Chai. You will be tipsy, you will like it."}
{"text":"The breakfast dreams are made of! I had to try the flight of pancakes, where I enjoyed the sweet potato (best!), blueberry Danish (yum!), and goodness (slightly dry, my least fave) pancakes. I added a side of bacon, which was cooked perfectly - not too floppy, not too crisp. The coffee was also excellent!"}
{"text":"Fun, busy place that has good food but must still be in the midst the of the fine tuning

Getting my name on the list for a table seemed to take forever at 9:30 am on a Sunday.  Not sure what was going on but take my name already.  Also find a better way to form a queue for the counter so I'm not in the way of your wait staff who are right to be annoyed that I'm in their way.

Speaking of. There seems to be two groups of workers there. A group of hard working zooming around folks, and a handful of waitstaff that seem pre-occupied with chatting it up with their friends...  

Food was served promptly and it was very tasty. I just hope there is Management somewhere watching the goings on to help turn the tables faster and keep the socializing to a minimum."}
{"text":"This may be a new favorite breakfast place, but I'm reserving that last star for when I've tried a few more menu items. The breakfast burrito with ranchero sauce was HUGE! So filling and tasty! I paired it with a spicy bloody mary and enjoyed my Saturday brunch. My honey got the Benny Duo with Chilaquiles and Bella! Bella! Benny. I sampled both and thought the Chilaquiles was the winner. Loved their hashbrows--even plain (which says something as I am a ketchup lover)! The barbacoa beef on the benny was so good I'm thinking I'm might sub out the chicken in the burrito for beef next time! As for atmosphere, I like the bright theme colors and interesting tables/booths. It was pretty loud inside and the wait was over 30 mins on mid-morning Saturday, but this location hasn't been open long. Solid meal and worth the price!"}
{"text":"Amazing food!!!! My husband had the eggs Benedict and they were great. I ordered their hash brown deluxe dish and omg it was so yummy! Great service!!!! Very cool atmosphere!!  Plan to wait a little bit because they are most often very busy. Great pancakes too!!! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place.  We were there on a Monday.  There were plenty of seating outside, but who wants to eat outside when it is already 100 degrees at 9 am?  Hence, the wait was approximate 30 to 40 minutes.  Pancakes are great, especially the pineapple upside down pancake.  Eggs are perfectly cooked to order.  Our server Ashley was great.  Definitely will return again."}
{"text":"I like this place, my wife loves it. They have good food, but be prepared to wait in line. It's worth a trip to come try it out."}
{"text":"This is absolutely the best breakfast place I've ever tried. Everything is in big portions as well. The eggs Benedict's is to die for l, I haven't had a good eggs Benedict since my grandfather used to make it for me when I was little. He was the head chef for Bally's in Vegas. The fruit oatmeal is by far the best oatmeal you will ever try."}
{"text":"Excited to finally try this place, so disappointed!  Waited 10 minutes before we asked to hostess to send someone to wait on us, no water no acknowledgment whatsoever. Food for a party of two took 25 minutes and was cold. When we told the waitress as she brought our check she told us \"we started off in a funk this morning and just haven't managed to get our of it\". She did promise to make it better next time, probably won't be a next time."}
{"text":"Loved the decor and variety of menu options. My friends and I liked our different selections, and the service was prompt and steady.  Interior design made for an especially fun experience!"}
{"text":"I've been pretty lucky lately finding good restaurants. This place was no exception. The wait was long...25 minutes on Thursday morning around 9:30am. They do text you when your table is ready which is nice. We wondered into Starbucks next door to wait for our table. 
Our waitress, Amber was amazing. Since it was our first time, she gave us few recommendations. Everything she recommended was perfect. I tried 3 of their pancakes. All were on the sweet side. So thanks to Amber I ordered hash browns on the side to balance out the sweetness. The pineapple pancake which Amber suggested turned out to be my favorite. She also suggested breakfast pot pie for my hubby which he loved. There are definitely many other items on the menu we want to try next time. Overall very enjoyable meal and experience."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped here for breakfast after church on Sunday.  We had a little wait, I believe about 20 minutes so not too bad.

Once we were seated, we were waited on by Angelo.  Angelo was fantastic, one of the most friendliest and personable waitstaff I have ever had!!!  He checked on us frequently, but was not a nuisance.  Each time he came to our table, he was smiling.  I watched him as he visited on his other patrons and he provided them the same level of service.

For breakfast, my wife ordered the Huevos Rancheros and I had the Chilaquiles Benedict.    My Chilaquiles came served with flavorful barbacoa beef over a stack of ranchero sauced tortillas and melted cheese, with poached cage free eggs, roasted poblano hollandaise, pico de gallo and cotija cheese.  I'm a HUGE fan of Chilaquiles, and these were good.  But I must say, it was a little strange having the barbacoa beef added to them.  They were definitely unique, I felt they lacked in flavor just a bit.  I had a bite of my wife's Huevos Rancheros and I kinda wished I would have ordered that instead.

I would visit Snooze again!"}
{"text":"Loved it all!!  Took awhile to sit down but the food and service was worth the hour wait."}
{"text":"What an awesome breakfast place. Lots of energy and lively music. Food items are innovative and delicious. When you go, ask for Hannah's station....she will take very good care of you!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious. I got here on a Sunday morning, so there was a bit of a wait, but it wasn't too bad. The service was prompt, and we got our food relatively quickly. Their hot chocolate and coffee are delectable, and their pancakes are amazing. I would absolutely recommend the pancake flight, but DO NOT ORDER THE BOURBON PUMPKIN PANCAKES. I have had pumpkin pancakes before, but these were absolutely disgusting. They tasted nothing like pumpkin; there were too many spices, none of which worked together, and tasted downright gross. Other than that, everything was good."}
{"text":"Trendy vibe, great location, delicious food and above average service. 

We had to wait 40 min for a table but had comfortable seating. Good menu of mimosa drinks, bloody Mary's and a couple beers. 

Wine on tap, cartel coffee on tap (if you're local, you'll know that's a good thing!). 

I ordered the breakfast burrito with red and green sauce on the side. Huge and tasty burrito- fresh ingredients and not greasy at all. 

Shared a choc chip pancake - it was the size of a large plate and so many chocolate chips. 

All around 5 stars, I will be back soon."}
{"text":"I'm terribly sad & disappointed! We ordered our usual Egg Benedict duos & their Green Chile Benedict's, their serving gotten really small with pathetic. So sad after spending $30 for only ordering 2 items. Will not come back & definitely not recommend this to our family & Friends. We really felt ripped off with our breakfast."}
{"text":"Everything on this menu is made with ethically conscious ingredients. They select their vendors based on how animals are treated and  crop sustainability. Then they make amazing food with it! I didn't know what marscapone was until I had their OMG French Toast and it is subtle and balanced. Their breakfast pot pie is huge and their corned beef hash is juicy. Even their eggs and bacon are the best I've ever had!
There's always a wait, so go early. I just leave my number and shop around the Commons."}
{"text":"My family and I were in town for our spring break vacation and we stopped by Snooze so we could see Scottsdale a bit. It was great with delicious food and nearly perfect service!! Next time we are around that area, we will most definitely will come back!!"}
{"text":"Very good breakfast.    I tried the Snooze Classic, which has real ham (thick sliced).  They also have hash browns and will ask you if you want them extra crispy or regular.  My husband had the \"Benny Goodman\".  They gave us a sample of the special pancake (pumpkin).  It was good."}
{"text":"There is a reason this place is packed starting early!

Staff was cheery and quick. We were seated outside quickly and the service was prompt.  We ordered two egg white omelets where you can choose three things to go inside. They put generous portions of meat and veggies. 

We also ordered a peanut butter cup pancake!  Needed some sweet to go with our omelets. 

The food lived up to expectations.  Everything was delicious and for the price was totally worth it. 

If you haven't tried Snooze it's time to add this to your list of go-to breakfast places."}
{"text":"Best hash browns ever!!!!  Fabulous breakfast.  Always a quality meal!  The service is quick and pleasant.  We even went by the one in Colorado because we loved the AZ one so much."}
{"text":"What a great breakfast an lunch cafe. We were referred by Chrissy, the concierge at Sheraton Desert Oasis Resort.

We enjoyed a very eclectic breakfast menu. The meals were incredibly delicious. Snooze makes a big deal that their ingredients are organic. You notice the difference right away in the appearance of the eggs. The whites of the eggs just look so clean an pure white.

My wife selected her favorite, the traditional Eggs Benedict. I didn't try any of her meal and she tells me that it was truly exceptional. 

I enjoyed th breakfast pot-pie. This was a fluffy, light croissant type puff pastry with a very light and tasty sausage gravy topped with an egg. I selected the egg over medium. The creamy egg yolk added such a smooth richness to the other components. I am not much of a potato fan and yet I selected these phenomenal hash browns. Make sure you get the hash browns.

Snooze is a little pricey. We were $30 for breakfast for two including a coffee and a juice. If Snooze was available in my home city I would hit this place probably twice a month."}
{"text":"Nice environment with friendly servers and a fun ambience but the food just wasn't that great. The eggs Benedict were a little bland and the creme br√ªl√©e pancake was good but not amazing. I can't remember exactly what my husband ordered but his meal wasn't anything to write home about either. There are so many other awesome brunch spots in the Phoneix/Scottsdale/Tempe area; I'll pass on coming here again and check out a new spot instead."}
{"text":"Sadly disappointed this time around. Not to say I won't go back, but I was hoping the Scottsdale location would come close to the San Diego experience we had. That was the main reason for eating here this time was the good breakfast experience we had there. 

It was Saturday morning around 9AM and it was busy as expected. After all if you don't want to pay hotel or resort prices nearby, this is one of your closest options, so expect a wait. The nice thing about this and every other location on the area is that they will text you when your table becomes available, and a wait of 35 minutes for 4 was not too bad. We were seated outside on a nice day, so another plus there. If you have a dog they do allow dogs outside. 

Now to the food and service. We had a simple three egg omelet, eggs Benedict, and kids meals for the kids. The best thing out of all this was the pancake in my kids meal. The food was average, not sure why I expected more. Portions were good and enough, the price is reasonable for the area and again better than the resort, but the food was pretty bland. The coffee they liked to promote had an odd aftertaste and after ordering a latte and Americano we didn't see those two until we had finished our meal. The server was pleasant, but seemed slow, confused or overwhelmed with other tables. I guess I won't really know. 

We won't try this place again anytime soon, but maybe on the next visit. Make sure you look at all your options and don't assume that one location will be the same as another. Unless it's Nordstrom you can't expect that same service and quality everywhere.

{"text":"Went at 1-2 pm midweek, no wait.

All I have to say is this: I'm not sure what they put in the pancakes, but I'm pretty sure I'm going to Hell for eating it. 

Eternal damnation for a couple of their pancakes? Totally worth it."}
{"text":"This is an update, went back to Snooze for a second visit. I was looking forward to the Flight of pancakes to sample 3 flavors of pancakes. I had the pineapple upside down sweet potato and blueberry danish pancakes. I thought they were bland not much flavor and dry. Had a side of bacon it was very good. Will be back again to try something new"}
{"text":"We LOVE Snooze! We've eaten there several times traveling to Colorado so we were excited to see a location in Arizona. We visited Thursday morning for breakfast. When arriving around 10am, we were told there was a 45-60 minute wait due to them being so busy because of the teacher walkout. Not wanting to lose pool time at our resort, I was apprehensive to wait. The hostess informed us of bar seating, we lucked out and walked up as a couple was paying, leaving us with no wait! We had the Dirty Chai and Old Fashioned cocktails, both great. We had the pancake flight, which is huge! Bacon was perfectly cooked. French toast smelled delicious and my husband finished it off. Tons of options, healthy, or not..as we went with. Hey-it's vacation!"}
{"text":"Have tried to eat here several times and the wait was always too long. Now I know why. It is absolutely wonderful. New takes on standard egg dishes. Super friendly staff. Cool vibe inside. My search for a breakfast place is now over. This will be my go to spot from now on."}
{"text":"After our Saturday morning stroll, Fork and I headed out for breakfast. Arriving at Snooze at Kierland just after they opened, we had our pick of the nice little patio or inside seating. Opting for inside, we were greeted with a brightly decorated, retro environment. We were promptly seated and greeted by our server who was there to see if we wanted coffee or orange juice. The list of unique bloody marys caught our eye and both of us elected to try their Gazpacho Bloody Mary (cucumber, pepper & garlic infused vodka and house Bloody Mary mix). Fork also requested a glass of water. Several minutes pass and our server returns to see what we want for breakfast...\"Did you ever get your water?\" I asked Fork, in our server's presence hoping he notices the miss. \"Oh, I will get that.\" He notices. Not only did he notice that, but he also noticed that I had set up a menu for a Bloody Mary \"photo shoot\" that I was planning on using in my Yelp posting. The server tried to take the menu, but I asked him to leave it and told him why. Immediately following that awareness, our server became much more attentive. Ahhhh, the power of Yelp!

Fork and I both decide to try their 3 Egg Omelette. You get your selection of 3 \"Fill Ins\". Fork decides to go with spinach, caramelized onions and mushrooms. I decide to go with ham, bacon, sausage, diced onion and cheddar cheese. Yup, more than the allotted 3, but not a problem. We both also ask for extra crispy hash browns and an English muffin. Fork also wanted to try their Quinoa Porridge (quinoa and oats, bananas, berries, walnuts, mascarpone cream and a drizzle of blueberry syrup) so we ask if we can get one order split in two bowls. Our server returns shortly after taking our breakfast order with the delayed water and bloody marys.

Fork commented that the Gazpacho Bloody Mary was just average and I would have to agree. It was fresh tasting, and reminded me of gazpacho, but the infused vodka didn't give the drink the flavor I was expecting. I will have to try a different one on my next visit.

Our omelettes arrived and both fork and I immediately notice that the English muffin is a bit over toasted (burnt?). Toasted items can always be a bit tricky. One person's \"under done\" is another person's \"raw\" and another person's \"toasted\" is another person's \"burnt.\" I am sure if we had said something (which we didn't) that our server would have gladly replaced the item. 

Both omelettes were good and largely above average. I noticed that the ham in my omelette was the real deal. It looked like it was just cut off a big old Easter ham. One note, the ham was cold and a bit off putting in a warm omelette. The other items (sausage and bacon) were properly heated so maybe the ham was missed and added late to the mix. The hash browns were very crispy (see my commentary about toasted items...the same applies here.). 

Fork said the Quinoa Porridge was good, but not as good as another reviewed restaurant, Duza's. But for my part, I enjoyed it. It was flavorful and appropriately sweet. I have't tried Duza's, so I can't compare, but I did enjoy Snooze's take on the item.

All in all, both Fork and I enjoyed our visit to Snooze and will go back. Their menu is plentiful and both their food and environment inviting. They allowed us to enjoy our breakfast at a leisurely pace which was appreciated on this Saturday morning.

{"text":"Me and my friends went here for brunch on a Sunday. While they told us it would be a 30-45 min wait to be seated, we found seats at the bar and were served right away. The drinks were good and the food was DELICIOUS!!! The entire staff was friendly, including our Bartender/ Waiter (I think his name was Josh, if not I'm really sorry) I will definitely be back for more!!!
**Try the cinnamon roll pancakes, they were to die for!!!!"}
