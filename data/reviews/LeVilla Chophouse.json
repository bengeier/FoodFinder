{"text":"Came here for my birthday dinner, and was not disappointed. The appy's, entree's, service, atmosphere, wine menu were all fantastic. I had the bone-in Tenderloin and it was cooked to perfection. One of the best steaks I've ever had, and I know my steaks.  Definitely would recommend to anyone. Such a variety on the menu, so whatever you are craving, you can find it here. They were also very accommodating to my 3 year old nephew that was having dinner with us as well.  A special little plate of mac n cheese."}
{"text":"Steak that melts in your mouth like butter, yep! This place is not just hype, it's heaven!"}
{"text":"My first time eating here.  Great service and ambiance.  The food was delicious!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here with my husband the other night and was rather impressed.  The food was delicious and cooked perfectly (he had the bone-in tenderloin and I had the lobster tenderloin).  The service was excellent and the wine list extensive with lots of reasonably priced bottles.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great service!!! Amazing food and excellent desserts!! I will be a repeat! ! Must try the stuffed meatballs!! Pricing is comparable to The Keg with this being far more exceptional than The Keg quality"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and awesome environment!  Love coming to this place for either a quick lunch or romantic dinner.  Totally recommend this place to anyone.  Took a few friends here and they all love it here.  Can't wait for the summer when they have their patio open."}
{"text":"Ambience was great. The service was excellent. Super attentive. We had a private section party of 10 and were treated amazingly. The portions are huge in comparison to the pricing. The owner rick came out, greeted us just to add a cherry on top. Most importantly the food was perfect. I recommend the share for 2 26oz stk."}
{"text":"The curb appeal and location are fantastic. With free parking passes validated if you park in the next building I was impressed before I even entered the restaurant. 
Unfortunately the service was inattentive and unsatisfactory. At a high end restaurant I expect more when it comes to checking on patrons and making an evening out exceptional. Especially when there are so many options in YYC. Our ravioli appetizer wasn't cooked or was dry, either way we were given another however, I wish that our server had more knowledge and when \"serving\" the food would have actually explained what went into the dish. It is a disservice to the kitchen to not even know what is on the plate. When asked what the flowers were that garnished the plate she said, they're edible! Well I knew that but she should know that they are marigolds as I'm sure the chef plates with care and attention for his guests. 
I seriously got better service at Earls last week! The stuffed tenderloin was superb, not surprising for a chophouse. My potatoes and asparagus unfortunately came out cold but it was never mentioned because our waitress never asked. There were no qc's done after the appetizer. When it came to dessert she dropped them off in the same manner and then asked when we were finished if we wanted coffees or teas...a little late I'd say. 
There were four of us, no manager or kitchen staff visited us to ask how we were....needless to say, there are many other steak houses in Calgary that do things right. Don't waste your money or time on this one."}
{"text":"So delicious. My husband and I usually go to the other location but tried this new spot today. We have never been disappointed with Le Villa. We consider this Our place for a nice night out. Forget the Keg. Go here! Ribeye steak, perfectly cooked veggies, warm bread, applewood cheddar stuffed meatballs, creme brûlée. All fabulous. Share the 12 oz ribeye with your partner. They can two-plate it for you and for $4 more u each get the potato and veggies. We always leave very happy and very full. I would eat here every week if I could."}
{"text":"Fairly nice dinner. 5pm on a long weekend Friday and only 3 full tables. Steak was lovely and they easily catered to my gluten free requests. Not amazing just nice but ill probably go again"}
{"text":"I was invited to Levilla for the Big Taste Calgary dining experience. Because of the size of our group, the reservation time we got was 8:30. The waiter was quite attentive while we waited for everyone to arrive. Their set dinner menu had options for all three courses which was great. I had ordered the cream of mushroom soup for the first course, the rib eye steak for the entree and the mango sorbet for the dessert. The mushroom soup was delicious. When I had ordered the rib eye steak, I thought it was so odd the waiter never asked how anyone wanted it done and I decided that I need to mention that I like my steaks cooked medium rare (anymore cooked I find it tough to eat) so he noted that the chefs cook the steak medium to medium rare. Is that odd? What about the people who eat theirs well done? My steak came and I was so disappointed. Mine was missing the sauce and the steak was over cooked. The waiter asked how was it and I said it's cooked to a medium so he took it back and got me a new one. Because of the time it was I was already getting quite annoyed. He brought me the new one and it was the same but I was already too hungry and everyone else was almost done their dinner so I just ate it. I hate restaurants where they can't cook a steak properly. Upon choosing the dessert, I had asked if the strawberry cheesecake was soft or more like NY style. He said it's more like a shortcake...huh? Your menu specifically said cheesecake but he mentioned that it was more spongy like cake so I decided to get the mango sorbet. The desserts came and the cheesecake looked so good. I got my mango sorbet and I had a couple of bites and thought, nothing special. I wanted to try the cheesecake as my friends were raving about how good it was. So I took a bite and thought, yum, it takes like cheesecake. I was obviously upset that I based my choice on the waiters comment. If it wasn't because our group was large enough that the 18% was mandatory, I wouldn't have tipped at all. I was looking forward to the dinner but came out severely disappointed!"}
{"text":"Worst steak I've ever had. You're better off spending $2 at Safeway to buy a steak-like product and cooking it yourself. Worst part was that I told them how bad it was and they didn't apologize and didn't offer to do anything about it."}
{"text":"I stopped by LeVilla Chophouse while in Calgary a week ago and decided to try it out since there was a Groupon for it. The food was alright, the ambience was awesome, but the waitress we had was RUDE and I had to pay for HER MISTAKE!!! 

In terms of ambience, it was super chic and modern and I was quite impressed when I first walked in because it was a very nice place with large booths great for larger parties. Such a cute place! On top of that, they provided validated parking, which was a definite plus!

We walked in around 2 pm and the place was nearly empty except one other table. We ordered the lobster bisque, stuffed meatballs, lobster mac and cheese, and the seafood club. While ordering, my friend was debating between getting soup or fries as a side, and I told him that because we were getting lobster bisque to start, that he should get the fries instead. So when the appetizers came out, the waitress presented us with two bowls of soup and the meatballs. I thought it was a bit strange that they brought the soup out in two bowls, but assumed that she had just brought two because she knew we were sharing, so she brought it out in two separate plates. She ended up charging us for two bowls of soup instead of just one. When I told her that I never ordered two bowls, and I thought it was just one serving split into two bowls, she was super rude and told me in a snobby voice \"that's what you ordered. It's $10 a bowl\". I replied that I wasn't aware that we ordered 2 bowls, and she replied \"well that's what you said\". It was incredibly rude, I ended up paying the extra $10, and I regret tipping her anything. 

In terms of food, the lobster bisque had real chunks of lobster in it, which impressed me. However, it tasted a bit too fishy - and I am a person that loves lobster and seafood! The stuffed meatballs were actually quite delicious, and I would recommend them to others! My lobster mac and cheese was just average. There was a half of a tail of lobster, which was impressive, but the mac and cheese on its own was incredibly disappointing. Not cheesy and somewhat dry. My boyfriend's seafood club was tasty and full of seafood. 

Le Villa definitely had potential, but with the rude waitress, I couldn't justify giving the restaurant a higher rating. However, I think if there hadn't been that confusion or if the waitress would have handled it better, I might recommend giving this place a try!"}
{"text":"On my last day, I knew I had to treat myself to a treat, and what better way to celebrate than to choose what Albertans do best: steak.

So for overall ambience, service and taste----this is date-worthy and any special event. 

notice how I left out value, since it's not for those looking for a good deal.  Even came here for lunch at $25 lighter, luckily for me, it's a write off but i digress....

Ordered the steak sandwich, and cooked medium instead of my usual medium rare...tender, just right....and the mushrooms cooked delicately juicy.  Still feel it's worth it if you appreciate good striploin.

Love the round action booths, I call them ;)

A bit of  a dim atmosphere, and still a hearty crowd even during the day.

gorgeous washrooms.

plenty of street parking all around.

nice corner location."}
{"text":"Family Dinner for 3. I was a bit concerned with the low ratings. However, we wanted an easy walk to a steak and decided on a 530 start. The server was helpful  and courteous. I had the roasted Caesar salad, quite good. My wife had the beet salad which was excellent. The three of us got steaks; a bone in filet, a regular filet and a ribeye. I think the bone in looked the best and was the most tender. I enjoyed my ribeye and my wife loved the filet. Overall, we were quite pleaded with the meal and would go back again."}
