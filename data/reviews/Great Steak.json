{"text":"Sandwiches are very good, fries are constantly undercooked and soggy.  Buffalo chicken sandwich is excellent.  Typical meal around $7."}
{"text":"Don't get kids meal with chicken nuggets!! Gross!! The workers are not friendly and the chicken you can plainly see are pre cooked in uncovered, undated containers in their cooler!!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars.
Bearing in mind this is airport food and there is a distinct lack of options at the airport, this place wasn't too bad to us.
It's pricey but that goes with airport territory.

The cheese-steak sandwich was put together fast and it hit the spot. We were pretty hungry so I guess that may be a factor but it was devoured quick smart.
They had just fried the fries so they were piping hot and complemented our sandwich well.

Plenty of seating and near our gate made this the perfect quick eat."}
{"text":"The worst customer service! The cashier was extremely rude. My potato is delicious but it's not worth deal with this guys attitude... I asked him as he was getting my drink if I could get extra ice, he looked at me and put the smallest amount of ice on it, while looking at me and gave me attitude the whole time."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE!!!! I wanted the Philly fries and by mistake I order cheese fries, the cook told me he can fix it I just need it to pay the difference, I approached the cashier and the lady told me I need you receipt, I please just charge me for the  meat  and she said I CAN'T.  By then I already waited over 10 mins after I got my order that I just left the place upset and shaky. I didn't want anything for free I wanted to pay, and the cashier would NOT assist me with that."}
{"text":"It's not even freakin busy in here and it's been 10 minutes before they even started making my order. Some chick is just mopin'around not anything I wanted chipotle but came here to be quicker, well the long ass line That was at chipotle was done before they even started making my order that's bullshit I'm not coming here ever again"}
{"text":"Let me say this - if you're claiming to be \"The Great Steak & Potato Co.,\" you'd better make a mean potato! Stopped here on a road trip, and I'm sad to say that Wendy's makes a better potato than these hacks. Seriously... they stuck a spud in the microwave and poured Velveta on it! It was shriveled and sad. Are you kidding me? No thanks."}
{"text":"March 4, 2017
My husband and I were hungry and considering we had a 4 hour flight ahead of us we decided to go ahead and get a philly cheese steak sandwich. We normally don't not complain about food but this was just sad. Besides being over priced the sandwiches were beyond salty. It was so salty we couldn't finish eating it. Had to go next door and buy ice cream just to get the salty flavor out of ours mouths. Beware!!!! There's a port of subs next door that seems to have better sandwiches than this place."}
{"text":"I am 7 month preggo and was craving a chicken teriyaki sandwich.  Decided to splurge for a $15 combo.  As I watched girl prepare my food and then the guys behind me.. I was outraged.  She handled the raw meat for the gentleman's steak Sandwich and then immediately proceeded to handle my bread, lettuce and tomatoes with the same gloves!  I asked her about it and she lied. she claimed she didn't touch the bread and then explained \"that's how we do things\" and the raw meat she handles was on paper.... in which she picked up the paper again to show me.   Very comforting. Being pregnant I don't need to roll the dice with a teenager cooking my food.  I asked for a refund and the manager made no apology, he was more concerned with getting the drink back that I had in my hand before issuing the refund."}
{"text":"Laziest employees on the planet! They actually closed with people in line!  People in line waiting as an order was processed and when the order was finished the employee told the rest of the people in line that they were closed at 7:59 on 12/12/15!"}
{"text":"Don't recommend. For the hassle of going into the mall and fighting through the crowds and standing in line, it's not worth it. Ordered a Chicagoland cheesesteak and a small order of cheese fries, and neither were anything I would come back for. The fries were really soggy and cold, and appeared as if the oil in the dryer hadn't been changed in awhile. The cheesesteak was subpar, overloaded with meat on one side and drenched in cheese and veggies with soggy bread on the other. Would recommend the jersey mikes less than a mile away on 75th ave and bell rd. Better prices, don't have to deal with the crowds, and the quality is outstanding compared to this."}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal here. Prob been to this location 4or 5 times. Tried something different each time. Love that they push their product outside on sample trays.  Staff is friendly, food is not over priced and always tasty."}
{"text":"I would give this a zero if I could. The meat is bad and loaded with salt to cover the staleness. Makes me feel sick!"}
{"text":"I ordered the cheese steak and chips. The burger came with melted cheese stuck to the wrapper. Tasted horrible, and was poorly made. The fries were all brown and had an after taste of the oil. Health department should raid this place to check how frequently these guys change the oil and if how many people have fallen sick eating at this place. For 15 bucks this food was worthless and will probably get me sick. Had to throw away half of it just because I could not even gulp it due to the horrible taste it created in the mouth. McCarran airport authorities should take away the contract from these guys."}
{"text":"Ordered a sandwich meal for over $15, paid, received the sandwich that was heavy on buffalo sauce so i asked for a side of ranch and was told it would be. 85 cents. I asked for a refund. This was the only place without a line so im guessing they could have used the 15 dollar transaction but instead chose to nickel and dime me. Bad customer service.. never returning."}
{"text":"The most disgusting food. Left a taste of barf in my mouth. Seriously nasty."}
{"text":"Employees were rude. I've had this place before, but today was very bad service and employees were confrontational.

Good food, poor service can ruin a meal.  Did not bother finishing food because of the poor service.

Corporate or management team, please please enforce customer service as a priority.

Ruined my Black Friday shopping experience."}
{"text":"Not great at all. Was charged $12 for the chicken philly combo. As i was eating the chicken i noticed the chicken was not Even real chicken!. I was so disgusted i dumped out the \"chicken\" from the sandwich and just ate the bread and fries. Chicken is not supposed to have the texture like the inside of bread. This place is way overly priced and you get fake food. This place needs to go to Charley's at the meadows mall and try a delicious Philly chicken it steak sandwich. If you're going to make a cheese steak do it right."}
{"text":"This place was alright. I ordered the Original Chicken Philly which comes with chicken, onions, and nacho cheese. The cashier told me that I could switch to provolone cheese if I wanted, which I did. The sandwich was alright-- it could have had a lot more flavor and it was kind of pricey for what it was. But the staff was super friendly and considerate, and they were relatively fast."}
{"text":"I should have yelped before going for this overpriced grilled McChickenish sandy on a doughy hero roll.  Ugh.  I was starving and quickly went in thinking of the delicious chicken Philly steaks of my youth from Great Steak.  This was NOTHING like the tasty sliced chicken breast with melted provolone and lettuce and tomato.  Red flag #2 should have been the menu was half @$$ed.  The actually added the lettuce tomato and mayo to the sandwich to make the infamous great chicken. And the wait?  whhhyyyywas it almost 15 minutes with one sandwich before and then an order of fries after me? Wth.
The only saving grace was the friendliness of the cashier and other employees I encountered.  
 Please do not waste your time and go somewhere, anywhere else."}
{"text":"As others have said...this is airport food, and Sky Harbor isn't known for it's establishments in the terminal.

That said, these guys put a decent sandwich together, provided you don't let them overload it with lettuce and tomato.  They have extra items (olives, etc) that aren't on the menu....so if you don't see it, ask.

Just a basic thin steak sandwich.  The fries are ok, but they lose their temp quick.

They overcharge a bit for their drinks, which are just 20 oz bottles....but I think their fountain machine appeared to be out.

Not the cleanest looking place....but when you need something to eat at 9 pm on a Sat night with a flight in 30 min, you work with what's available."}
{"text":"\"NOT THAT GREAT STEAK\" should be the name of this place. Crew needs to communicate, 5 orders were messed including ours in a span of 15mns. Their sandwich station is just terribly dirty. It is obvious that this place needs to be manage right. And the asian lady cashier is very obnoxious."}
{"text":"Addicted to this place! Same guys have been working there for years. Cheesesteaks, fries, everything is very good and consistent!"}
{"text":"I would give this no stars if I could. The food is over priced but that's not my problem. My problem is the customer service. When I went up to get my order I did not know what order was mine. I asked the guy who has been working there for ever how do I know my number and he said I don't know what's your number in a rude way. I said I'm not sure how do I know. I received my food and after that he bad mouthed me to the girl working with him  if you are to speak ill of a customer wait until they walk away first. I will not be back for sure."}
{"text":"This was the most over priced trash mall food I have ever eat two small sandwiches, one medium drink, and one medium fry. It's a mall food court. But wait is the food even decent no. Bacon chedder was some melted cheese slice and one piece of skinny bacon. 100 percent Trash"}
{"text":"Took my wife to this place, located at the food court inside Galleria Mall. It's been around since the mall first opened so I figured it must be good, but what a surprise I got. The food was expensive, not very tasty and the person at the register talked on the phone for about a minute before he took my order. My wife was not impressed, nor was I and we won't be going back."}
{"text":"The worst service ever. 25 min to get one order and two people working...lazy ass people... I work for a living and so should they. But apparently not in this case."}
{"text":"Honestly only place I eat at when I come to the mall. Everything else is disgusting. This place has a wide selection of cheesesteaks. My favorite is the ChicagoLand and get the 12 inches one! So much cheese!! I love it I also get a side of fries and some cheese so I can dip them in the cheese! Best thing if you're at the mall! Cooked fresh right in front of your face!"}
{"text":"Fresh and great tasting. I wish they made one of these outside of the mall."}
{"text":"This place was very bland but cheap. I made the mistake of getting a potato when apparently the cheesesteaks are where its at. Will I be back? Probably.just to try a cheesesteak!"}
{"text":"This place had a very well priced cheesesteak sandwich but the combo is not that valuable. Stick with just the sandwich for a little over 6$"}
{"text":"I had some time to kill before my flight out of the Phoenix Airport so I decided to try out the breakfast sandwich at Great Steak.  I had the beef egg sandwich which was actually really good - it's pretty much a philly cheese steak sandwich with eggs on a smaller round bun. My complaint about this mainly about the worker who was behind the counter cooking. It was about 9:58am when I stepped up to order, I think at 10am they stop serving breakfast and he kept complaining to the order taker to stop taking breakfast order. The way he was whining and talking very loud not only held up the line but made the customers uncomfortable.  He kept saying \"she's the last one, she can order a sandwich but no potatoes\" the other lady working behind the counter said it was fine, I can order potatoes to go with my sandwich. The girl behind me wanted breakfast too and the cook guy kept saying that she definitely has to be the last one. I don't understand how breakfast could end so abruptly and I'm only allowed to order the sandwich and not the combo.  The guy was rude and he may have been getting off shift because when I looked up again it was someone else cooking.

It's unfortunate because inside an airport you only have so many options, I wish the airport has some sort of say with the business inside so that travelers can have a good experience as a whole."}
{"text":"Me and my husband were shopping around the mall today and decided we were hungry. We go to great steak and wait to order. When we get up to the counter we are greeted with an angry face and rude attitude, the man that helped us didn't have a name tag on so I don't know his name but they need to seriously check the way they treat their customers. When we were thinking about what size we wanted our meal we were rushed and treated very poorly. Definitely not happy people here, I'm sorry your not happy but you need to put that to the back of your mind and try your best to treat your customers respectfully."}
{"text":"Meh. It's not horrible, just not anything special. It' similar to a Charlies Steakery with limited choices."}
{"text":"Worst sandwich ever, steak if that what it was, so badly burnt and there was not even enough meat in the buns...I combined the meat into 1/2 of the bun to make a sandwich but it was still sooo completely gross I couldn't eat it..this crap meal was $25.00 which was a waste of well earned money...never ever going to eat here again or should I say BURP here..."}
{"text":"The place is ok. 7\" sandwich, fries and a drink for $10 seems to be the norm price now for food.  It was not gross,  it was not spectacular.   I thought is was odd that in a world of free refills, they want to charge 50cents for a refill on a cup they filled with ice anyway.  

Not saying I would not come back, but in the mall food court their are several other options I will check out first."}
{"text":"Located at the Vermillion Valley Travel Plaza in the food court.

I ordered a loaded baked potato and thought, this is gonna be good!

I opted for the steak with melted cheese.  They served it in a black plastic take-out container with clear lid.  Lemonade was the drink of choice.

The steak was more like sliced roast beef, and the cheese was the kind you get out of a machine to put on top of chili or a Coney Dog.

Still, it was great tasting and a welcome change from the usual fast food offerings."}
{"text":"This has got to be the worse customer service with the most longevity! I've only been there a few times hoping it got better but it got worse and the price is just as bad!! I will never again go there. They have 2 brothers that own the place. Ones extremely rude and the other smiles and takes his brothers rude demands!"}
{"text":"Wish i saw this before i ate here. Saltiest f'n thing ive ever eaten. The roll was terrible and the steak was poor quality. The cashier was obnoxiously laughing at her coworker. And the prices...$13 for a steak and soda. Philly would be sad. Was that steak?"}
{"text":"Give yourself extra time for your food. Tasted okay, but the service was horrible. They showed no interest in taking or completing orders."}
{"text":"Prices extremely high for what u get.  You get totally ripped off on the 7 inch sandwhich.  Absolutely no customer service ....rude and unhelpful. The older guy taking order was an absolute jerk. The guy that handed out order wanted to charge extra for a squirt of ranch dressing after I just spent $22 for a meal.   This will be the next place to close in food court.  Too much competition to deal with that."}
{"text":"What, the potato is gross. The \"philly\" cheesesteak sandwhich is gone in 3 bites. Its all so small and salty. We are travelers. We are not stupid."}
{"text":"I used to come here a lot when I lived in Tempe. It is one of my favorite places for a quick bite at Tempe Marketplace -- aka the new Desert Ridge. 

The employees are always nice and even though I'm a bit picky with my order they have yet to make a mistake. I like how the drink/condiment section is set-up. Plus: the bathroom is spotless.

The food is kind of heavy before a movie -- at least for me -- but I like it for dinner or a late lunch and dinner, I think linner is what they call that meal..."}
{"text":"Yum the great steak n coney fries - can't go wrong! They were out of ice tea which saddened me, had to order soda which I hate to drink."}
{"text":"OK, but not very good compared to Charlie's in the Old Arcade."}
{"text":"Split a classic philly cheese with husband.  It was very tasty, but for the price, I was expecting it to be twice the size."}
{"text":"Oh my god!  
I would give zero star if there was an option. 
And it was $10 for that. Over price and bad quality"}
{"text":"Home sick and craving a Philly Cheese Steak I was excited to see Great Steak. The first time I ordered a Philly cheese steak and cheese fries. The cheese steak was anything but great; however the cheese fries made up for it. Second time around I decided to skip the sandwich and just get the cheese fries. The large  fries were like potato chips and the cheese was lacking. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Two stars because they were open late. I tried to order the broccoli and cheese baked potato. Mostly due to the horrific reviews of any meat. But of course they didn't have any broccoli. Okay, so butter, sour cream baked potato. The baked potato, a water, and a small soda cost $15.00. Wasn't surprised. When the potato came out there was a glob of sour cream the size of the potato on it. Very unappealing. The potato skin was rock hard and the inside flaming hot. The Cheese. Okay the freaking cheese was insane. Way too much. More cheese and sour cream than actual potato. It was crazy. I tried my best, and ended up throwing away what I barely touched. Lesson learned. Listen to the reviews!!!!!"}
{"text":"Nothing great about this place  I got a steak and cheese with peppers and mushrooms and paid an extra $2 for the 'add ons'. The bread was flimsy and they used a weird cheese that didn't melt very well."}
{"text":"The cheesesteak meal is $11.24 after tax.  Like most airport food, it is overpriced , the taste is average, and the portions aren't great.  The soda in the \"meal\" is a bottle rather than a refillable cup."}
{"text":"The sandwich was so damn salty. Perhaps the most salty cheese steak I've ate. Not worth it."}
{"text":"Um...yeah. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else.  Not so great steak nor potato.  What kind of company is this?  A restaurant?  Are you sure?  Okay I'm being mean now :(  I sure this is a great franchise however it just didn't work for me.  I can't say I'm an expert in Philly sandwiches, but then again I really didn't order one.  I got a Philly burger, but man -- I rather eat at McDonald's - or even worse Hardees (You Midwest peeps know what I'm talking about :) )  Let's just say I'm not a chef but I can make a better tasting burger.  The decor of the place -- well I just didn't care for it after a while.  - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Fries were cold and the tomatoe slices were merely laid on top. I know this is airport food but plenty of fast food places make a better cheesesteak"}
{"text":"Well I read all the bad reviews after I ordered and luckily the customer service was not bad.  We wanted to try something new so we gave this place a try.  We thought it was a little pricey for a burrito and cheese fries but hey it's their business and they can charge what they want.  One thing that gets me is when businesses want to charge you 75 cents for a small cup of ranch.  I'm like really?!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I frequent this place a lot! We love it. This morning I was craving a ham delight so we got in the car and drive across town...I was interestingly looking at the yelp reviews and saw that the ratings for this place were poor at best. As we were walking in, I was telling my fiancé that there's a lot of haters that don't know what's up with the place.

As we walked in I ordered my ham delight and guess what...NO HAM! Are you kidding me? How can this be. I was pretty upset and let them know and they did give a discount...seems like poor supply chain management not to have a good supply of ham for the holiday season when you know the mall will be busy...

I still like the food that's why the four stars but come on get it together or these yelp reviews will start to hurt your business."}
{"text":"Okay so... let's start with cleanliness... it's disgusting. And I could see several health code violations (string uncooked meat with veggies for example) the country terrible out front was deplorable at best. Service was eh. Took the order that was all. Now to the real issue: the food... ordered the most simple item... the salad with chicken. Which made me so glad I didn't get a sandwhich here. The lettuce was Rinehart the veggies seem okay... but the chicken was prepared (fresh?) Not really they are precooked then reheated on a stove and COVERED in grease..( he added what I can only assume is canola or vegetable oil 5 or 6 times to the tiny portion of chicken.) It was disgusting. The chicken was mediocre and fatty to top it off... never again. I should have gone to kys (the Greek place across the food court) like I always do and am never disappointed with"}
{"text":"Straight up Mall Food Court style cheesesteaks - we stopped in here in between movies at the AMC and we're indifferent to it.  Not bad, not great, just ok.  I'd eat here again if I was starving and needed a quick bite, but I certainly wouldn't take the whole gang and tout it as a culinary adventure.  To hate this place based on the quality of the food is like hating McDonalds - you know what you're gonna get, so you can't really hold it to a higher standard.  Sandwiches were decently-sized and the fries were crispy and hot.  Service was slow - only one guy running the counter and grill while his coworker was out getting coffee.  When she came back, she seemed a little flustered by the traffic in the store.

All in all, average."}
{"text":"The super steak is amazing and if you haven't tried it your missing out. They are under new management for the last few months and everything is properly covered and labeled. -new employee"}
{"text":"Pros: tasty fries. Tasty (if salty) meats/onions. 
Cons: 10+minute wait for sandwich and fries! Yellow cheese is like nacho cheese, not what I've come to expect on a cheesesteak."}
{"text":"This... was ridiculous. I ordered a sandwich and a side of fries, I was then told I had ordered something completely different and was charged almost double only to be given less than what I had asked for. I have been to good Great Steak Restaurants, but this was definitely not one of them. Way to make the company as a whole look good. 
Also, they guard their napkins like it's some sort of currency. I didn't even know how to respond to that."}
{"text":"$20 for a chicken Philly sandwich, fries and one large drink.  Plus the $1.50 for a ginger ale because they were out of Mtn Dew and they still want to charge me .87 for a ranch cup?? What a joke"}
{"text":"we at here 8/2/14 around 7 pm.  the menu was very easy to follow because this was our first time eating here.

we ordered the 7\" ham delight, kid's chicken nuggets, 12\" original philly.  i sample all the food we ordered and it was crap!  i wouldn't say the worst food and by no means am i a philly cheesesteak guru but the food we ordered was not good.

the service was okay.  will not be going back ever again."}
{"text":"Located in McCarran International. B Gates.
It's a small little eatery with fountain drinks and a short menu. I had the original and I've had philly's out of the frozen aisle with more flavor. I didn't like it at all.. You've got meat and cheese sauce, onions.. I added mushrooms and didn't get them.. 

Food at McCarran is on par with gas station food. I've yet to have anything at this airport that I've liked."}
{"text":"It is a decent steak sandwich place for a mall, the food is nothing to write home about and a bit pricey. I dislike there is a charge to refill your drink after spending over 10 dollars on a meal, most other malls steak places don't charge for something like that (or at least offer 1 free refill). 

The staff are very courteous, but outside of that, I only needed to go there once before deciding to look at other possible places to eat. I had the bacon cheese steak with fries and a drink, personally I have the food a 7/10."}
{"text":"I wish I could give it a zero first of all I don't think they know  how to add, I ordered a 12 inch Philly cheese steak sandwich extra meat extra peppers and extra onions they told me $23 a sandwich I asked the guy if it's $11 add $0.88 add peppers and onions another $2 extra meat is $3 more so that comes out to $17 he's telling me it comes out to $23 these people they don't know how to add or  just robbing the customers. Very bad business"}
{"text":"This score was based solely on the customer service I received from one of the employees. She created everyone except me. Actually gave me a dirty look and as I placed my order acted as if she didn't understood me. While asking me to repeat what I ordered which was a bake potato with cheeses. Then gave me a dirty look when I ask which number was mine. Which I seen her circling everyone's recipe before me."}
{"text":"You could do worse. We're basically talking State Fair quality here; acceptable considering your location, but I wouldn't drive as far as the end of my driveway to go get it. I ordered a standard Philly Cheesesteak combo. Sandwich was A-OK, but what do I know, I've never been to Philly. Fries were boring and could have benefited from some salt. Staff was friendly and efficient but dining area is small and prison-grade. My combo was about $14 bucks. For an airport, you'd be hard pressed to do better at Burger King."}
{"text":"In the past I really enjoyed Great Steak, even though it's not a legit cheesesteak they usually tide me over. However, this particular location was terrible, one of the worst sandwiches I've ever had. Won't be back. EVER."}
{"text":"Met a tempe marketplace for a quick meeting and decided to do lunch.  walked around to find a good place to eat and the selling factor was the guy standing outside the door with free samples.  one bite and we were in.  great sandwich and easy to order and quick to deliver.  and the pigeons haven't discovered this section of resturants yet (if you have been to tempe market place you know what i mean).  we ate outside and i must say i love this time of year. great sandwich too, did i mention that.  don't be swayed by the phoney irish pub next door with the girls in the short kilts, we almost fell for it but went with the fat greasy guy handing out samples of their delicious sandwiches. maybe will have the kilts next time!"}
{"text":"Being a philly girl, trust me, I didnt order a cheesesteak here with high expectations. I ordered a chicke cheesesteak. I woukd say it was a decent SANDWICH but nothing like a \"cheesesteak\". I also ordered the loaded fries which were  such a disappointment. The \"cheese\" tasted like water"}
{"text":"The location of this place is nice (over in Terminal 4, gate A7) since it's quiet and there aren't many people wandering around. The food is fine - unfortunately my fries came lukewarm as opposed to piping hot... they were probably sitting around for a bit. Overpriced like all airport food, but it's still a pretty reliable cheesesteak!"}
{"text":"Wasn't serving lunch even though their sign said \"Now Serving Burgers\". Guy behind the counter was a grump."}
{"text":"They've closed down a majority of these places where I live so I was pleased to run across one here at the airport. Though it is not on the vital menu, I ordered the Buffalo Chicken Philly and it was just as good as I remember it. The fries were good too. It was just a little pricey for everything, $17 with a Snapple. But I can't really complain, I'm sure it's the airport location mark up."}
{"text":"Overpriced. Badly. The older guy taking orders is so rude, you would think his wife just died. Just horrible"}
{"text":"It's crap.  If you want something to fill your belly, go to Hudson news and buy some snickers.  Bread is hard, meat is not juicy and flavor is missing.  Main message: WALK AWAY"}
{"text":"Grabbed dinner here before a movie. I got the bacon & cheddar cheesesteak (no onion) with fries. It was pretty good. I like how soft the bread is. I love the natural-cut fries!"}
{"text":"I have been eating at this Great Steak location since I was in high school. How yelp missed it all these year is beyond me. Anyway, Great Steak has terrific Philly cheesesteaks. They also have a yummy chicken Philly. Their fries are fresh cut and soft, not crispy, so they're not my favorite. I just go for the subs, as they're pretty hot and damn good. If you like melty, cheesy, cheesesteaks that are on par with or better than Mr. Hero, this is your place to go."}
{"text":"This place was definition of Airport food = Over processed, Over priced, Probably one of the worst steak sandwiches I have eaten. But I already had low expectations & they met them. If you have the time, choose Better options down the concourse."}
{"text":"As I sprinted around McCarran looking for vegan options I quickly discovered that the designers decided to keep up the local theme of desert when it came to the food options made available here. Thankfully I was able to find this place near my gate and I ordered up a Veggie Delight which is vegan as long as you hold the cheese. I was pretty disappointed by the size of the sandwich relative to the price but the ingredients were decent and I kind of enjoyed it. What more could I possibly expect from airport food? The fries were pretty good though and helped fill me up for my journey back to the east coast.

The staff were polite and cool enough to warn me about the cost of the Stella Artois which is always appreciated but fell on deaf ears because I had a four hour flight ahead of me."}
{"text":"We ordered a baked potato from this fast food restaurant and the potato was really dry so we went back up to the counter in order to get some sour cream to make it a little less dry and add some flavor. This place wanted to charge an extra dollar to add the sour cream on something that should already include it. Overall very unsatisfied and not going back here"}
{"text":"Definitely not worth any of youre money . We were starving expecting to order something that would hit the spot and it was not good at all . We ordered the bacon cheddar cheese steak and definitely was a disgrace to a philly cheese steak . There was one tiny piece of bacon slapped on the top of it . The guy at the cashier was blatantly not paying attention because he was texting on his phone right in front of us and then got our order wrong when ringing us up making up pay an extra $3.75 +tax for and even smaller cheesesteak that wasnt even worth the extra money . The fries were super cold and the people were not friendly at all . Dont even waste your time ."}
{"text":"The experience was terrible - the bread was too soft, soggy and flavorless - I paid over $15.00 for a lg sandwich with small fries and small drink.  I've been to other Great Steaks and had much better.  I won't be back and suggest that others avoid this place."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE!
The person that was in charge named (Patrick) would not take my money because he was telling me it was fake, i told him to call security and the security offer named (B. Oles) said there was nothing she can do. I told Patrick to use a money marker pen to check and he claimed they dont use those so how does he know my money is fake? Racist is what i call it! I have photoes and video to prove it! Then i told the security guard (B. Oles) to call her manager because she was no help at all and didn't seem to care. The mall manager came by and took me over to another business where they had a money marker to check and it was REAL! They exchanged it for smallers bills but i didnt go back to 'Great Steaks' never again! Bad business and horrible customers service! All thanks to (Patrick)"}

The cheese steak is alright. I have had a lot better and try not to eat food like this too often. The line moves pretty fast. I really do enjoy the french fries. They remind me of the Boardwalk Fries in the old Westgate mall. I think they are fried in peanut oil."}
{"text":"On Nov.1/2016 around 7:20 pm. My husband was on the line about to order quick food here and he saw one woman who was working here dropped the bread on the floor. Instead she should throw the bread away to the trash, she put it back on the tray and acted like nothing happened. 

My husband told her and the other worker there about food safety issue. Told them that they MUST throw that bread to the trash due she dropped it on the ground. It is not acceptance to serve the dirty bread to next customer. After that my husband left, he didn't want to order anything from this place. No one really understand or have knowledge about food safety. 

My husband is not  on YELP so he wanted me to warn everyone about this place. You take your own risk eating at this place."}
{"text":"Not my first time here, not the best steak sub but if you're at an airport hungry  it's something decent to fill you up, get it without the sauce or get it on the side to enjoy the sandwich. They over loaded the sub with sauce in my previous visits so I learned my lesson. The fries is good and fresh. Will be back the next time I'm stuck at Las Vegas Airport. ;-)"}
{"text":"Disappointing, 2 times in a row. Thought I would give them the benefit of the doubt because last the meat had a funny, old flavor. It was the same this time. They've gone down hill.

However, their cheese fries are good."}
{"text":"I Was in the mall food court and hungry so figured why not give the place a try. Wasn't terrible but was not worth it overall. Ordered the Chicago cheesesteak combo that came with fries and drink. It was ok but I've had much better cheese steak. It was very fresh and hot so one star for that. Guy at the end of the counter that was handing orders out was very nice so another star for that. That's about it for positive. Guy taking order who i think was manager wasn't too friendly. Barely said two words and slammed my drink down like he was annoyed with me. The worst? 14 dollars for a 7 inch sandwich and a handful of fries. I was in so much shock that I just paid but looking back now I should have told them to keep it for that. Way overpriced."}
{"text":"I mean, it's Great Steak...in the Galleria, which is dead. It always has the longest line because it's one of the only places left that isn't a full blown restaurant and won't give you food poisoning. 

My friends and I have a joke where we ask each other how our food was from their and our answer is always the same \"Mediocre at best.\" 

If you want something semi-quick (I wasn't joking about the line, it is sometimes insane), that is basic fast food, then this is right up your alley.

I've tried many of things, chicken fingers meal, philly steak meal, salads, bake potatoes...all are good and what I expected. I'm always extremely full after and sometimes may feel my arteries clogging as I'm walking back to the office."}
