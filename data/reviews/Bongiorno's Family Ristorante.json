{"text":"Great Italian Restaurant!  Nice patio with live music in the summer, or a welcoming, romantic atmosphere inside.  The food is above average and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Bongiorno's early on a weeknight this past fall.  She had a steak and I had the Chicken Marsala.  Her steak was good, but nothing special that warranted the price.  The Chicken was terrible...bland and tough. The decor was comfortable but very dated.  The service was ok.  Overall this was a disappointing and expensive experience."}
{"text":"Ryon R you are an idiot.  Because of you - who I suspect is a person who frequently complains in order to get free meals - a 12 year employee lost her job.   Never once have we seen her give poor service and we are regulars there.  She is alway multi-tasking.  Helping out in the kitchen as well as helping the servers.   But even more importantly bongiornos now lost 4 regular customers because of one idiot looking for a free meal. We spend more there in one week than that idiot ever would but now we won't go back.  Shame on you bongiornos"}
{"text":"This place was always one of my favorites, but our visit last night may have been our last. They were under staffed, the bar service was terribly slow and my dinner was cold. They did remake my dinner, which were good but not great. Hopefully they can get their act together."}
{"text":"Our second attempt at this place.  We tried a few years ago and I have to say I was equally disappointed this time.  We did not feel welcome from the start and it went downhill from there.  The server was good but frumpy and it seemed as if she would have been happier had we not shown up.  The ciabatta bread was warm and tasty, my wife thought the salad was ok but I was not impressed.  Two at our table ordered Aglio e Olio and it was tasteless.  I ordered a special, mussels and salmon on linguine with roma tomatoes in a puttanesca sauce.  Something smelled foul and at first I thought it was a bad mussel.  The mussels, pasta, and salmon were fine, and the tomatoes were delicious, but the puttanesca sauce was week and here's where I found the source of the atrocious aroma, putrid anchovies.  They tasted like they had been steeping in ammonia!  Blech!  Never again.  Ciao Bongiorno's and che liberazione!"}
{"text":"The service was very good. 
My wife and I went looking for pizza, and were very disappointed. The crust was soft and soggy. The cheese was too thick and uneven. Maybe their meals are better, but after the poor pizza, I won't bother returning."}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour food, drinks, service, & atmosphere. Really enjoyed crab stuffed appetizer @ $5. Pizza & calamari good also. Dante Cab Reserve house red was good - $5 during happy hour. Hope to return soon."}
{"text":"Terrible service.  It started with the host and continued with the server.  Very displeased.  Maybe they dont need the business."}
{"text":"I have lived in Twinsburg for almost 20 yrs and pass by this restaurant quite a few times per week. Only this week did we decide to check it out for the first time ever.

The restaurant is pretty small and the bar is divided from the dining area by a glass wall. We went to the bar. It maybe seats 8 people? We were greeted nicely by the bartender. We got there early, and she explained their early bird dinner special. For $12.95, you get a choice of Italian wedding soup or the pasta/bean soup, house salad,  home made rolls, entree and beverage.  

My husband and I ordered a different soup each. Both were delicious.  The rolls were hot and fresh.  We both had the salad with house dressing.  My entree was fettuccini Alfredo and my husband had chicken parmesan. I thought the sauce on my dish was a bit bland and I definitely had to season with salt and pepper, but the noodles were fine. My husband loved his chicken dish which also came with a free side of pasta and sauce.

I can't believe we never went here before. I always thought it was just a pizza place. To be honest, I didn't check out their regular menu, as I was blown away by the specials, but we'll definitely be back. Good job"}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend a few times. Home-made Italian food so good! Loved the atmosphere and Cannoli and Creme Brulee Dessert! For dinner I had Fettuccine Alfredo with blush sauce. THE BLUSH SAUCE WAS TO DIE FOR! FIlet mignon was AMAZING! my boyfriend likes the Shrimp Carlos or Halibut. Such good food so glad we found this place! service was very good!"}
{"text":"I've been going here for years. And the quality of food has been going down.  I now only go when some friends insist on going there.  Apparently we don't share the same taste buds."}
{"text":"We have been at Bonjournos a coule  times in past year. The service has been terrible.  High turnover of staff, not friendly.  Menu never changes, food fair.  Ambience very dated, bathroom dirty and in need of update."}
{"text":"I ventured into Bongiorno's after moving out to the East Side. It's got quite the location, where one can easily drive past it, but always notice it. A couple of friends were heading there, and the fiancee and I used the chance to venture out, meet them, and try this spot out.

I was floored. It's rare restaurants can surprise me. I've worked in my share. Hell, I've run my fair share. I know the twists and turns in kitchens. I know the cheating of blanching, and \"Chef Mike.\"

The food at Bongiorno is on point, and home made. And portioned for taste and pleasure, not leftovers.

The service was five stars. 

I Yelp, but I don't think of Yelping when I go somewhere, but this place- I knew I was going to give some love to. And I come on Yelp, and realize- there are some of them dreaded Elite folks who think they know what good food is. You ever research some of these Elitists? They give poor reviews for good, home cooked food, and good reviews to things like Dunkin' Donuts? (No disrespect, but-...  you know...)

Maaaan, Yelp... 

Trust me, reader. Go to Bongiorno. Get the Early Bird special. Try your favorites, relish in perfect portions (not over the top, gluttonous portions that'll stretch your stomach, and ruin your experience) and get a second order of them warm, buttery buns to sop up your sauce. 

This place is five stars in my book."}
{"text":"If there had been a sweet Italian soundtrack to our dinner, it would have screeched to a halt when our entree arrived.

  I was just patting myself on the back after our rolls, soup, and salad, that are part of their super cheap $12.95 early bird special dinner.  Such a great value! I was thinking.  Boy am I smart!  The soup was good, the rolls were fine, the salad was even super yummy.

  So we had high hopes for our chicken and eggplant parmigiana...  They looked like typical breaded stuff slathered in marinara.  They tasted like something scraped off the floor.  My husband said it tasted like the pasta water was old and musty.  The chicken and eggplant both tasted like some kind of nasty fried in nasty oil.  I was so, so, so disappointed.  

  It takes a lot to make one feel like they've wasted $12.95... I mean really.  But we both looked longingly at McDonald's on the way home.  Super disappointing.   I'm actually a little worried about one of us getting sick off this food.  I only managed three bites of my chicken and my husband finished it because it was gross, but at least better than his eggplant.  He said that was the worst eggplant parmigiana he'd ever had.  

 Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Food was okay, clean and fresh, just lacking flavor, it would seem taste is added by adding sugar to the food.
We had lasagna, nice sized portions, great meal, just sweet.
Spaghetti was an ok dish but no flavor that popped.
Pizza was nice fresh crust, just a bit sweet.
Ambiance was fine up until a door or window was opened and the smell of the garbage outside wafted through the place but my guess is that was probably just our bad luck, surely that cannot be the norm."}
{"text":"This used to be a solid four star \"go to\" for quality Italian and I had been there 5-6 times. However,  this was my first trip back since they closed and reopened and it was an entirely different experience. Same name, similar menus, not nearly as good in any facet. 

They used to make dishes that were unique, creative and told you there was a chef in the back who was putting in effort. Today's meal tasted straight from the freezer...bland, dry, unimaginative, and the best thing I can say is I am 6 hours out from the meal and neither my wife or I have food poisoning so it was prepared to the right temperature and we were less hungry than when we walked in. The bread they brought out seemed like rolls bought from a Costco, but were warm and nicely coated in a garlic butter/herb mix. Not bad, not bad. We ordered three dishes with a variety of pastas and one with chicken. The chicken definitely came from a frozen Sysco pack and the sauce straight from a jar. If you are charging what they are charging for pasta, meatballs, and sauce there has to be some effort put in and you could taste there was zero. The marinara tasted like the $2 jar I used in college while trying to stretch my money. Meatballs were commercial and previously frozen. If I can sum up the food in one sentence: we left there and went back to our place to grab some ramen. 

Service was courteous, but the kitchen was slow. The menus need to be reprinted or wiped down as the one had sauce smears on it. The ambiance that once would have you bringing a date here was now not so good background music, vinyl table clothes, overly bright lighting, and tables too close for consistently private conversation. It is overpriced and I would go to Olive Garden before returning here which is unfortunate. 

The owner should make changes or it will die a slow, agonizing death and I would love to see it revert to its previous form."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant for lunch yesterday. When we entered it smelled like smoking had been permitted inside which was not pleasant. Since we were a group of 5 we decided to stay. The temporary menus written in tiny print on pieces of paper were hard to read. One of our group needed gluten free options which were not available. 2 of our party ordered the salad & pizza options, they were satisfied. Another ordered the chicken parmesan sandwich which came with roasted potatoes, she had to ask for some marinara sauce as this was not on the sandwich.  The gluten free person had the same potatoes, plain chicken & spinach. The rolls brought were good. However , one person that ordered the chicken francaise was brought  the veal instead , and the spinach bed that was described on the menu with it , was not included. A side of pasta came with this item and was tasty.  When the omission and incorrect item was brought to her attention, nothing was offered to correct it other than an \"I'm sorry from the cook\". The waitress was pleasant.The prices are a bit steep for what is included with these lunches. Also the 5 of us were the only customers in the restaurant from 11:15 to 12:45pm. The restaurant is supposedly under new management but nothing has appeared to have changed except the lunch hours. It will be difficult to create a solid customer base. This used to be our go to restaurant years ago and was always good but the last few years it has gone downhill, sad to see."}
{"text":"Food okay. Really loud atmosphere. Could barely carry on a conversation. Made reservations but when we got there they pulled a table and put it right in the path of the servers. Constantly servers bustling by on both sides of us. Server only offered one special, a calamari dish. We ordered veal Parmesan and pasta garlic and oil. Overheard another server list four specials after our order went in. Husband's soup came, I waited 5 minutes before my salad made it to the table. Doubt we'll return. :("}
{"text":"For starts let me say how excited I was to see Halibut on the menu. Ohio is way too far from the Pacific NW to see it very often. 

It was very good. Cooked and seasoned just right. I had no delusion of comparing to fresh from the NW, but i would rate it high for the area. 

Small quaint place worth a drive for a nice change."}
{"text":"I had the Chicken Parmigiana, with cavetelli noodles as my pasta side.  I feel like the only spice they used in the marinara was oregano.  I tasted nothing else.  I even had the taste of oregano in my mouth for an hour or two AFTER I finished eating.   Other than the overwhelming taste of oregano... my dinner was quite bland.  The chicken, while maybe cooked a little more than I would like, was okay."}
{"text":"Overpriced, bland food. I had hopes this place had gotten better in the last few years, but it needs a new chef and some love. Ordered veal parmigiana and my husband got chicken parmigiana, and we both had to add salt and cheese to season the food. Gracious portions and ok service, but you're better off cooking at home or going to Little Italy or even Olive Garden....which pains me to write."}
{"text":"Homemade italian food at it's best!  We have been there a lot and have never had a bad experience, and the food is spectacular!  I tell everyone about this place. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Jovial server.  Nice dark wood decor.  Wonderful halibut special.  If you like eggplant parmesan, you can have it as an appetizer or an entree."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. I mean amazing. I had the creamy mussels. My husband had the chicken piccata. Fresh, artisan and just wonderful. 

But three stars because the atmosphere sucks and because we got stuck with the bartender as our waitress (it wasn't even busy - 8 pm on Saturday night). 

For the atmosphere - no music playing. Weirdly quiet. All you heard was banter in the kitchen. No energy. 

Then for our server. Had to ask for water repeatedly. We were deliberating the menu and needed just a minute to figure out what we wanted. She left for 10 minutes. (Why is asking for a minute when servers are asking for your order a kiss of death?? They never come right back.). 

We might try it again because the food was that good. But man. The other stuff seems so brainless to figure out."}
{"text":"Jim is an amazing cook.  This is fantastic Italian. It's a local, family business that is worth supporting. The patio is wonderful in the summer. I've had most of the items on the menu and they're all delicious. Whether you're having a pizza night 
, getting a classic pasta dish, or eating a veal chop, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Not worth the money.  The quality of the food was poor quality and bland.  Our friends had a veggie pizza - the veggies (carrots, peppers, tomatoes) were cut in large (I mean large) pieces and plopped on top of a cheese and spinach pizza.  Decent crust though.  I had eggplant parm - no taste (the spaghetti was just as blah).  My husband had a dish with shrimp and the shrimp was bad (rotten, not poorly seasoned).  When the waitress asked us about our meal, we told her.  She was surprised and said \"sorry\", but that was it.  She didn't tell the chef or anyone else.  Brought us our bills and that was it.  The price of the food does not align with the quality or the attention to the customer.  Oh - and when they brought our water - two of the glasses had lipstick on them.  The waitress took them back and brought new ones, but no apologies.  Definitely no attention to detail at this restaurant.  There are many other good restaurants in the area, so our recommendation is to steer clear of this one."}
{"text":"Third time eating here and we have enjoyed it more each time! The risotto cakes are incredibly delicious, we've ordered them all three times and they have been consistently excellent. The ciabatta rolls are warm and fresh. The house salad and dressing are enjoyable. We usually order pasta dishes and both of us love the marinara sauce. It's rich yet mild and has just a touch of sweetness. 

Last night we arrived at 8pm and the place was packed (parking is limited although we always seem to find the last spot). Despite the noise and bustle, our waitress was quick to take care of us and very attentive throughout the meal. We brought our own bottle of wine ($15 corkage fee) and the manager came over and opened it for us personally. We offered him a glass but he declined.

After devouring 2 servings of rolls, our salads and the risotto cakes, our entrees arrived (all courses perfectly timed which surprised me given how busy they were). I got the sausage cannelloni and she got the pasta aglio y olio. Both of us thoroughly enjoyed our meals, the exemplary service and the option of bringing our own bottle of wine. Can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Hmm... Bonjourno has gone down in favorability during my last two visits. This past experience sealed the deal on me wanting to write an updated review. 

The complementary bread is still delicious. Our appetizers were good. We got the stuffed banana peppers and a veal stuffed mushroom cap on special. The 'trouble' started with the drink orders. My brother had gotten the wrong one, a Flat Tire instead of whatever dark IPA he actually ordered. We actually suspected our server was new, so that was easily forgiven. Then we tried to get ranch with the side salads. They were out. My father tried to order the orange roughy fish dish. They were out. It wasn't exceptionally busy or on special so I'm not sure why those items were sold out. 

My mother ordered the mussels as her entrée, they came in a red sauce over pasta. A handful of the mussels were unopened after being cooked, which means they were dead and bad. The ones that did open were overcooked. Very chewy and gritty. The pasta was not al dente. 

My sister ordered a dish on special that involved crab stuffed halibut. It was so stinky! Something was old but we weren't sure if it was the fish or crab. Mixed with the typical stinky aroma of cheese, it was bearable though. 

Off night? New server confusion? You can only make so many mistakes before customers don't return."}
{"text":"The pizza is oven baked and tasty.  The pasta's are great and well seasoned, tasty dishes are cheese lasagna, pasta primavera, and many more."}
{"text":"up until recently I had tried their take out. I got a chance to try this place full service with my mom. Its really an ok place. Good food, decor is okay, service is okay, The server could have been a bit louder in such a loud restaurant. They had so many elements of a good upscale italian place. Napkins, wonderful presented menu's ( love the binders) Love that they have professional look uniforms. But its missing a few things to make it great. I think its time to remodel the place. Not that it was falling apart, just really starting to seem dated. I glimpsed into the kitchen from where i was sitting and it looked pretty clean. Maybe an update and a repaved parking lot is all this needs to be a go to spot for the surrounding cities."}
{"text":"Just opened up again with new owners. The wait staff was friendly but everyone seemed somewhat confused. The kitchen timing was off. Some meals came promptly and some were really late. The food is still good but the portions are much smaller than previously while the prices are the same. The charge to substitute went up. Overall still good but less value."}
{"text":"Everything about the food is wonderful. They have exceptional Italian Entrees. I especially like this haunt during the Winter. It has a cabin feel to it and you don't feel rushed, like you do at Olive Garden.
I also love their salads and warm rolls. I have not tried the desserts yet, but I am confident they are wonderful. In the summer, the outside deck is full of happy patrons. This restaurant is golden."}
{"text":"One of those places that's probably pretty good because your parents took you there and there's always that one dish that makes you feel at home and you like the way it smells and you see something and you remember your silly aunt Steve. 

Unfortunately for me, I don't have those memories.

There's a fear of better options, and that fear is realized.  I got take out pizza one time, and 3 toppings drove the price up to $26.00.  I need some good pizza for $26.00, and this wasn't it.  Another night for dinner, the Italian dishes were good for middle of road Italian food."}
{"text":"Four stars for a quaint better family restaurant in a small town. Had a Groupon, and were pleasantly surprised. Arrived 7:30 on a Saturday night and the place was full, so we sat at the bar. Everyone at the bar were eating dinner. The chicken Milanese on spinach was very good. The filet on rosotto was also very good. I started with rhe wedding soup. There was no barley in it and only two pieces of a meatball perhaps. Had lots of spinach tho with swirls of egg white. Different but tasty. The crab cake salad was large with two crab cakes. Chunks of Portabello mushrooms were nice. Drizzled around the lettuce were roasted red pepper sauce that was warm--very nice--and balsamic vinegar. Missing was the Mozzarella cheese. I would like to see less romaine lettuce and more spinach with a Feta cheese.   Sitting at the bar was fine and service was very good. Definitely will go back."}
