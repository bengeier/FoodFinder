{"text":"We have gone to the Pines for many years for special occasions and dinners.  We choose it because of the fine food, atmosphere and location.  We recently went there for dinner with a party of 12 with vegetarians in the group, and the chef prepared something special for them. It was wonderful as was everyone else' dinner.  The seafood, steak pasta and appetizers were top notch. We plan to visit whenever we have a celebration or special event again in the future."}
{"text":"We live in the area and have eaten at Pines Tavern for dinner; HOWEVER, my husband's most recent experience at this establishment was horrible and has changed our view of this local spot!  Recently my husband took an out-of-town friend there for a drink at the bar.  They sat at the bar and were quickly approached by a female bartender who rudely told them that the seats they had sat in were quote \"not meant for them\" but were for a local couple and that they had to move (which she could have conveyed more politely as my husband and his guest had no idea the seats were reserved).  Graciously they moved to a different spot in the bar.  The same bartender then rudely asked if they were eating or just drinking.  This bartender created quite a scene in the room and my husband and his guest felt very unwelcome as if they were outsiders who snuck into a private club.  All of this could have been avoided if the bartender had treated them more politely and been more welcoming which is her job!  This place is not welcoming to outsiders and clearly only cares about their regular patrons.  If you are not from the area or don't frequent this place go somewhere else.  There are several other equally nice restaurants in the area that are more welcoming establishments."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been eating at the pines for nearly 10 yrs. to be fair we hadn't been there for at least 8 months because that meal was mediocre and expensive. But, it was late and on the way, so we thought a quick stop in. They really have made the pub area much more modern and inviting. Unfortunately, I believe in order to make this restaurant over the top they have to scale down to one main menu and a pub menu. The problem is that dishes suffer because there are too many offerings. I ordered the vodka sauce with shrimp. It was not the pink sauce that should be mildly spicy. Instead it tastes like tomato sauce. My husbands fish special was dry and served skin side up. The presentation alone was unappealing. Both dishes were just warm, which is the number one reason I will not visit a restaurant again. Scale down the four menus and concentrate your efforts on certain signature dishes and I feel the restaurant could be elevated to the next level."}
{"text":"My friend invited me to this restaurant... have never been here before. . . The first dish i ordered (a ravioli with a olive oil sauce/infusion) was so oily that i could not eat it.... The waiter was gracious and allowed me to switch my dish... i then chose a pasta with a chipotle cream/bechamel sauce. . . I couldn't eat that either because the sauce was so hot and spicy...(for my taste, I found it unpalatable.  My friend who enjoys hot and spicy food tasted it and then grabbed her water to cool the after sting; it may help to mention on the menu that the chipotle flavoring of this dish is intense or perhaps can be adjusted for a milder flavor). So, for lunch, i had coffee and a roll (rolls were good);  For dessert we had coconut cream pie which was delicious. . .Service was very good; My friend paid for chipotle dish i ordered though it was left uneaten. . .I would say go for the ambiance, rolls, coffee and dessert. . . i cannot recommend the food (entrees), unfortunately."}
{"text":"Went for lunch yesterday and got the chef salad lunch special that had spinach and grilled chicken plus other veggies.  I also ordered the ginger peach decaf iced tea.  I did not know that the tea came in a bottle (large ) but it cost $4.50! Wasn't prepared for the extra charge.  The salad was just ok not worth the 14.99 price tag. Not very much chicken nor much feta cheese. Left very hungry and spent $23!! Disappointed and won't go back."}
{"text":"I just adore The Pines from the lounge/bar area, to the white table cloth dinning area, and outside seasonal area....The food has always been delicious and a nice wine and beer selections."}
{"text":"Incredible food. Delicious. Fresh. Creative salads. Seafood exceptionally well prepared. Desserts were worth the calories. Banana crepe with home made caramel was superb.

Only drawback is the nasty elderly woman when you enter. Never smiles, is crabby and very unfriendly. She needs to retire, or  take a class on being pleasant to customers."}
{"text":"We are very disappointed we chose this restaurant for a special family gathering

My parents-in-law made a reservation for 7 o'clock on a Saturday night. We had a group of about 20 but we did have an advance reservation. We waited two hours to be fed and received only a $25 compensation for the delay on about a $500 bill. I would not recommend the restaurant to anyone else due to this poor service and compensation for it

Also one of us ordered a steak medium rare. When it arrive 90 min later it was way well done. Waitress apologized and returned it. With our reminder 20 min later its replacement was finally brought out, and was good 

The food tasted good when it came but the service and the response to the lateness was inexcusable

I am frustrated enough at this time that I would rate zero stars, but I don't know how to do that."}
{"text":"either i am Bi-polar or the restaurant is.  Sometimes i come here and its fantastic other times i have gone and the food is overcooked or the service is lacking, but when they are on the drive out here is definitely worth it.  Their menu changes with the seasons and they have their own garden so the potential for something special is always there.  A good tip for this place if you dont want to spend a lot of money is to eat in their lounge where you can get most of the same food for a lower price."}
{"text":"Tonight I had probably one of the worst restaurant experiences of my life.  First, we waited an hour for our food. I had ordered trout, but got salmon. I let the waitress know, but told her that I would eat it anyway (I was starving). I said nothing more. Suddenly the manager came over (I did not ask to speak to her). She told me that it was pink trout. I told her that I can tell the difference between trout and salmon. Yet, she kept insisting ( in an angry tone) that I was wrong and it was trout. Thanks, Hannah, I will never come to the Pines again. I suggest that others think twice before going! BTW, NOTHING was comped. We got a piece of pie and not even what we wanted."}
{"text":"Place smells like a nursing home as soon as you walk in. Food is....not that good. When we complained they didn't even offer to comp anything... Really. Never will go back. Manager was arrogant to say the least."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place - but I can't.  We normally go once a year, but last year we didn't because the time before i wasn't impressed. 
First the inside STILL smells like cat pee. 
Secondly service is extremely SLOW. We went here today and it was not busy and food took forever. 
The most disappointing fact is the price you pay for the taste of the food. It's really not that great. I keep
hoping that I just keep ordering the wrong thing but every time it's not that great.
Tonight I had the soup dujour that advertised clams. My thoughts is that is was microwaved because it was not a consistent temperature. Also, there were less than 5 clams in an entire bowl of soup. I also had the peach dressing that had no peach taste.
This place leaves me feeling underwhelmed for the price I pay. Way better places to eat locally. I tend to see older folks eating here who maybe are unaware of the better places to eat."}
{"text":"K and I would give 10 stars if possible. We always sit at the bar and Beth takes great care of us. The menu changes regularly, and every thing we've selected is tasty and well presented. Highly recommended! Disregard any negatives because those writers obviously don't know good food."}
{"text":"5 of us came to the Pines on New Year's Eve for an 8pm reservation. There was no parking, and then we ended up needing to wait about 30-35 minutes (which was light compared to other patrons). This was not overly surprising for a holiday evening, but I was very annoyed with the lack of any area in which to actually wait (not even the bar was available). We ended up needing to stand in a hallway with the bathrooms, between one of the dining rooms and the kitchen, with servers passing through every minute or so and the toilets flushing just as often. Other patrons were forced to stand in the entryway of the restaurant, getting a chill every time the door opened. It was all very uncomfortable. It would have been nice to have been offered a small glass of cheap champagne or a finger food while we waited, also, considering we were not walk-ins (no one was) and should have been seated by 8:05. I understand that occasionally it's out of the restaurant's control - but then you should do what you can to accommodate your waiting guests. 

Once we were seated, we were greeted by a very friendly server. She was knowledgeable and offered great suggestions. I thought the dining room was oddly bright, especially considering the evening, but was otherwise decorated nicely.

We started with 2 appetizers - one was great, the Chesapeake crab dip, and one, the grilled brie, was just... bad. We didn't come close to finishing it. It sounded promising... baguettes, bay shrimp, peppers, olives, and herbs. What we got was a very small piece of brie on top of a dinner plate full of soggy toasted baguettes covered in what was absolutely canned ingredients (the hot peppers, olives, and possibly the tiny tiny shrimp were all straight from a can). There was about enough brie to cover two of the bread pieces (see posted photo). It was an unfortunate way to start the meal. 

Two guests had the lobster bisque (I think all 5 of us would have if it came in a smaller portion). It was decent. 

As for our main courses, they were definitely the highlight of the meal. I had the scallops, which were tasty and cooked properly. My husband had the duck, which he enjoyed, but it was a bit overcooked. Our other 3 guests were happy with their meals (a mix of pasta and red meat dishes). 

We were all craving something a little sweet so we opted for dessert - which we regret. Between us we had ordered the \"Pecan Ball\", vanilla ice cream rolled in pecans and topped with hot fudge & caramel, and a coconut ball reminiscent of a snowball. The pecan ball had either been pre-made or made with very stale pecans, and they were soft and flavorless with very little actual ice cream in the dish. The coconut ball was equally unimpressive and was left behind almost in its entirety. 

Apps: 5/5 for one, 1/5 for the other
Mains: 4/5
Dessert: 1/5
Service: 1/5 from restaurant, 5/5 from server

Perhaps if we had had a better start to the evening, I would have had rosier glasses on. But if you stick to the meal portion of the menu (or that delicious crab dip) and you should be happy."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time came here. Really great service and delicious food.  Both times everyone in our party enjoyed their food. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time last night with my wife and mother in law. I won't be going back. We had reservations at 7:30 and arrived at 7:25.  We were told \"it's going to be awhile before we can seat you.\" While we were waiting another group of 4 walked in without reservations and were told it would be an hour wait - when they went to leave the manager told them \"let me see what I can do\" - they then got seated immediately while we waited in the bar.....until 8:15. And that point the hostess came in and called another group of four - I asked them what time they had reservations for and they said 8. Long story short - we finally got seated at 8:45.  The snapping turtle soup was awesome!!!!!!!!  Unfortunately that came about an hour before the rest of the meal. The filet was not cooked well and tasted like gristle. Chicken lettuce wraps came with about 5 strips of chicken. And the side of what appeared to be breakfast home fries tasted like raw uncooked potatoes.   We ended up finally finishing our meal at 10:45.

Long story short - hostess and front of the house is terrible and lacks basic customer service skills. Wait staff was super pleasant helpful and friendly. Food is mediocre at best. And the whole experience is not worth dealing with unclear wait times and seemingly random seating orders. 

Spend your money and time somewhere else."}
{"text":"Common courtesy is not a priority here.  My wife and I endured a cell phone user in the tavern last night who filled up the room with his voice.  We talked politely with management by they refused to say anything to him and even made excuses that it happens everywhere.  We know better than that and he was still talking after 45 minutes when we paid and left.  Never to return again.  Terrible atmosphere and at those prices! Management needs to smarten up!"}
{"text":"Where to start?  The arancini were the only okay thing we ate, but for $8 for 5 tiny rice balls, they were not worth it. They were also served on a plate of wilted greens. Not appealing. The beet salad was a disaster on a plate. I'm not sure how a salad with arugula, smoked blue cheese, and beets could taste like nothing at all. The beets looked to be cut up out of a can. The blue cheese was bland.  The dressing had no flavor. Imagine my surprise then when the orecchiette was salted beyond oblivion. The pasta itself was terrible with a bizarre texture. It tasted either like it had been cooked, held, and fried, or possibly microwaved. It was spongy, like perhaps it had been freezer burned at some point. I can't adequately describe it other than a salty mess. My boyfriend's ravioli was the opposite texture - gooey pasta covered in a gooey unappealing gray sauce. The ravioli was described as being a broccoli and spinach ravioli with sundried tomatoes. There was no broccoli to be found. The ravioli was also filled with mushrooms, which was not in the description.  Nowhere is \"mushroom\" listed in the menu description.  He hates mushrooms. Reading the menu this place sounded amazing. The execution was atrocious. For what we were served, $83 for dinner was highway robbery. We were hoping for a nice evening out and instead left feeling hungry and deceived."}
{"text":"hosted lunch for 18 family with preset menu -- perfect execution: food quality, service, ambiance.  Highlights: mountain trout, dinner salad steak, salmon bisque (a first), rhubarb pie.  accommodating, economical given the quality."}
{"text":"Came here for years but lately it is a real hassle to get in and get seated even if you  have a reservation.  The hostess is rude and very put out when you call to reserve a table on the phone.  When you do arrive the night of your reservation, you have a long wait in a very small lobby.  The hostess waddles around aimlessly, while the crowd of reservations grows.  She is very disorganized and short with  the customers.  Don't expect a clean table from her.  

Wait staff is great and if you are lucky you will get a seat when this particular hostess has the night off.  Food varies.  We will be giving this place a rest for a long time!

Shame on you Pines Tavern."}
{"text":"Waited over an hour.  Decor is awful and needs to be updated. Huge crowd, so obviously enough cash flow to make it more desirable.  Food is normally good, but on this date steak was awful.  Overcooked with grissle.  Had to spit into napkin because I couldn't swallow.  Please consider adding staff to avoid this type of wait"}
{"text":"We went with some friends and had dinner outside. Which has a nice atmosphere however when it got dark the lights on our side where not working . This made it very difficult eating our food. The service is slow. The food was just okay. I would not go back."}
{"text":"A very elegant restaurant that is off of a \"country road\" and is surrounded by all the woods.  I go to CMU, so being all the way out here in Gibsonia was quite a trek and quite an experience.  

I walked in and it felt like I was in a really fancy country clubhouse.  The menu is quite extensive and has awesome appetizers like hummus, fried calamari and brie.  They even have local soda (!) here, and my friend got cherry soda that didn't have high fructose corn syrup in it.  They also have a menu of the day on a piece of paper that accompanies the normal menu.  Prices are rather high here, with appetizers averaging to about $10 and entrees from $15-$30 depending on whether you get the specials or not.  There's something for everyone here.  I even saw lamb and veal on the menu.  Definitely a place where you want upscale food. 

I got herb roasted chicken with mashed potatoes, topped with applewood bacon and restaurant-grown spinach.  The glaze for the chicken was very delicious, but the chicken was a little dry.  They put grilled onions in the mashed potatoes, which was awesome.  The dish was about $20.

Our waitress was very nice and was pretty good about serving us.  There was even live music, as a pianist was playing great tunes from Billy Joel and other artists.  A very pleasant environment to eat, and I would like to go back again!"}
{"text":"From the moment we walked in until the moment we left, we were extremely impressed. We had a reservation for Valentine's Day. Thankfully it was earlier, so we were seated right away. The restaurant filled up quite fast soon after we got there. 

The hostesses were extremely friendly and cheerful, which is always nice to be greeted with people who seem to love their job! Our server was quite possibly the sweetest I have ever had. Extremely attentive to us and knowledgeable of the menu. 

My husband got a beer and I got the winter sangria. The sangria was delicious! We decided to start with the Baked Pull Apart Blooming Bread. Very good. The bread was warm and soft inside, yet had a crisp edge. The cheese was melted in the cuts of the bread, so there was cheese on every bite. Highly recommended!

I got the Lobster Bisque and my husband got the Snapping Turtle Soup. I loved the lobster bisque. I am not sure if there was a choice between a bowl and cup, but I got a bowl.. it was a huge portion. There were large pieces of lobster that were mouthwatering. My husband liked his soup, but was indifferent to the spice that took over the taste. 

For our meals, I got the crab and shrimp ravioli and my husband got the filet migon. He ordered it medium, but when it came out it was more like medium well. Not to worry, because it was amazing. By the time my meal came, I could hardly eat anything else. I did have one ravioli and it was so good and even amazing heated up the next day! 

I couldn't even look at the dessert menu because I was so stuffed, but we left so happy and can't wait to return to try different menu items!"}
{"text":"Today was my first time at the Pines Tavern - attending a friends baby shower.  The back room was beautifully set up and the perfect size for the event.  However - the floors were so slippery several of the guests nearly fell walking across the room!!  The staff promptly filled water glasses and made sure guests were well taken care of.  I was not particularly fond of my meal - but then again I am a picky eater!  Parking is a little chaotic and could use some restructuring to accommodate Normal diners and event parking!"}
{"text":"I took my wife and some friends to Pine Tavern on Friday night.    The restaurant was relatively slow for a Friday night and that should have been my first clue.    It took one hour to get our salads.   The waiter told us that he was delaying the salad because the kitchen was so slow.  The Filet Mignon was a poor cut of beef.  There was grizzle and fat in the filet and it was not properly cooked.   The fish specials were bland and not a lot of flavor.   The dinner took us over 3 hours to complete. Harry, the waiter, said he would treat us to dessert since dinner took so long and it was my wife's  birthday.   We found out later that he charged us for the desserts.  
Harry would not even comp us any drinks.    We were the very last table to be served at 10pm on a Friday night.  We will not return.  there are too many great restaurants in the area.  This is not one of them."}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch on Friday. I ordered the sandwich of the day which was spiral sliced ham and american cheese with a sundried tomato spread on wheat berry bread. Huge portion and really tasty. The outside patio was relaxing and private. The interior was a bit dated and when you first walk in the hostess stand is a desk which kinda gave it a funeral home feel. I saw some reviews about poor service, the service here isnt their strongest and actually prob one of there main opportunities but not a reason to not try this place. In my experience it was a slow lunch scene one waitress was running around busy while our waiter would take care of us then dissapear for a period of time. Not sure if they are short staffed or what but good experience overall."}
{"text":"DRINKS: I had the raspberry champagne cocktail (raspberry puree/sugar/vodka combined with their Brut champagne, yum!) and my fiancé had some of the beer on tap, can't remember what the first glass was, but the second was India Pale Ale

APPETIZERS:  Finacee had the lobster bisque - I had a taste and it was quite good. I had the app off the specials menu that was a \"bruschetta\" with shrimp/tomato/cheese (warm) and sliced pita with spices. It was really good and a large portion too

ENTREES:  Fiancee had the Jumbo Shrimp dish and I had the Scallops with lobster and shrimp risotto. I tasted his dish and it was OK, a little bland for me. But my dish was amazing - some of the freshest seafood I've had in Pittsburgh since moving here a year ago! 

DESSERT:  We shared a slice of the caramel apple cake - the cake was supermoist and sort of like carrot cake but with apple flavor instead, the caramel buttercream was awesome, tasted like butter but not too rich, and the cake slice came with great vanilla ice cream and whipped cream. Even though we were getting quite full we pretty much cleaned the plate!

SERVICE: Quite friendly. However, it took awhile for the dishes to come out, especially the appetizer. Maybe it was because it was a Saturday night and it was busy, or maybe because they do that on purpose let your hunger and the food stay on course together. Who knows.

DEALS/DISCOUNTS: None

OVERALL: I loved it! Not only was the food fantastic, the ambiance was something unusual and refreshing - loved the live singer/pianist combo and the relaxed atmosphere. Would def like to go back again, perhaps for a special occasion or when we have visitors in the Burgh!"}
{"text":"I was a little cautious of going here as the Yelp reviews were really mixed. Many 4 stars reviews but also an equal number of 1-2 reviews. We needed a place close by and decided to give it a try. We opted to sit at a table in the bar area. We were greeted quickly and ordered a glass of wine from their decent wine list. We went with the Meatloaf and the Tex Mex Chicken Salad. I would of enjoyed s little more spice on the chicken, but lowered my expectations given the restaurant. 
We enjoyed the meal and the service was good."}
{"text":"I had the Scottish salmon sandwich yesterday. It was excellent. The atmosphere was nice and quiet. I would go back for sure."}
{"text":"We went for dinner yesterday.  My husband's collard greens were not cooked.  Either we're my son's potatoes.  Food was bland and extremely expensive.  We used to go here all the time, but we won't be back."}
{"text":"Good  food. Although the tavern chips weren't anything but fried potatoes. Why are they known for them? The steak was tasty but a tad over cooked and not as I ordered. They let me pick my sides which was nice. Truffle mac and cheese and brocoilli were good. The service was poor, at best. We sat at 745 and at 945 were presented with the check. There was nobody here. Service could have been a lot better."}
{"text":"I've been to the Pines many times.  One of our favorite restaurants! !!
Eating in their Garden by the stream is sublime.  
So many memories of lunches with Christmas decorations. Raspberry pie to die for."}
{"text":"We stopped into the pines Tavern for lunch.   It was a good experience but we feel little urge to go back.   The entrance area is dominated by a large office style desk where the hostess sits.   You feel like she is a secretary.   The main dining room was very nice.   We had the fish tacos,  the lobster bisque,  and the pot pie.   The bisque had the requisite flavors big chunks of lobster,  but the puree texture was outr of place.   Felt w like potato puree with lobster and sherry.   The pot pie was good and the plating was modern.   Seasoning was weak however.   The blackened fish tacos were the bright spot.   Excellent taste and texture.   I ended up sharing them with my daughter because  she didn't like the bisque.   It was a good meal but it did not blow us away."}
{"text":"Don't know what the hype is about.  Went their for lunch and ordered off their special Christmas lunch menu. Ramsey took the order and returned in 5 minutes with the bloody Mary's (not recommended too sweet) and rolls without butter.   Waiting 45 minutes for the meal.  You would think the special menu would have a quick turnaround?   Understand it's busy and the holiday season.    Not likely to return.  Good food but not worth driving for"}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times and considered it a solid 4 but today it was barely a 3 star.  We came for lunch and both ordered lunch specials.  They were out of the fresh mozzarella for the lamb panini and offered to substitute another cheese.  The lamb was overdone and tough and came with a side of commercial tortilla chips.  I ordered the mac and cheese with chicken that was listed as Tavern Comfort food. It was bland and the salad was smiling in dressing.  Overall, not great food.  I will probably go back as I have had many good meals here.  Hope it was just an off day."}
{"text":"Had a delicious meal at the Pines Tavern Saturday! Our party of 4 was one of the first to arrive that day. The restaurant was very quiet and the place was still heating up (literally). I wasn't sure what to expect. Located right off the road and didn't look like much on the outside, but the interior was charming and looked very nice.

We shared appetizers of onion rings and wild mushroom dip with zucchini chips. The wild mushroom dip was delicious! Onion rings were large and crisp. It was a very good start to the meal. I ordered the meatloaf, which came with mashed potatoes, green beans, and cinnamon apples. It was very good! Other members of my party had the Chicken Pot Pie, Fish Tacos, and the Tavern Grilled Cheese. No one left hungry and everyone commented on enjoying their food.

I will eat here again."}
{"text":"Not worth the trip. The menu is huge and bizarre. The food is poorly executed, most likely because the menu is so long. Mediocre at best. Even the pub style basics fall short. The calamari are greasy and the breadcrumbs fall off, leaving a pile of plain squid. The burger came out missing the onion rings with wilted lettuce and tomato on the side. Even a side of mayo was hot and yellow from sitting under the grill. Not a worthwhile dining experience!"}
{"text":"I am so sorry to say that we had a terrible meal and service at the Pines Tavern last night.  We sat at the bar, and it's hard to imagine bad service at the bar but this server basically disappeared, and only after we asked for some attention from one of the other servers did this woman reappear.   The meal was described as perch over potatoes and warm Brussels sprout salad with a Swiss chard pesto.  This brownish green covered fish(not perch) appeared and sat over cold hard unseasoned fingerlings with black spots throughout and tasteless mushy Brussels sprouts.  The most disturbing thing was the color of the pesto, in no way did it look like food, it was truly gross.  Since our waitress never checked on us I just picked at it but it was not edible.  The Pines always has had an overly ambitious menu, they need to stick to basics and try to master simple fresh food.  It's so disappointing because it's a convenient location."}
{"text":"Every time I give the Pines another try, I am again disappointed. Too many menus , too many choices on the menus,so everything is just average or below average.  It's a great location! And great atmosphere... but the food is not good. Drive to the city and enjoy great food at another restaurant."}
{"text":"Having dined at Pines Tavern many many times, we thought it would be a great option for dinner for our party of 7. Not this time....

I made a reservation for 6:30. The first in our party arrived at 6:22 and were rudely told by the hostess that the reservation was at 6:30. Go wait in the bar.

Once we were all seated at out table, our server took our drink orders. Then she took our appetizer orders...but we didn't get our drinks yet. The appetizers were served....STILL NO DRINKS. Then she took our dinner requests....STILL NO DRINKS. She kept apologizing, saying that the bar was \"backed up\". Then she said the bar was very crowded. Not OUR problem. Waiting 40 MINUTES for our drinks is NEVER acceptable...ever.

The hostess (?) came over later after our entrees were served. When we suggested that they needed more help at the bar, the hostess said\" we all need more help!\" Really???? No apology. No concern. 

Now for the disappointing food. Another patron was served a very interesting looking fish sandwich. It looked so good that two in our party ordered this 40th Anniversary special. The middle sections of the fish were good but the ends were very overcooked...actually to the point of being charred. Vegetables accompanying other entrees were tough and inedible. Nothing was outstanding except the raw oysters and the turtle soup. 

A busy Saturday night should be critical for any restaurant and should be PLANNED for. Customer satisfaction should be paramount. Hire more staff, demand excellence in the kitchen. Make sure your customers come back.  We won't."}
{"text":"Beautiful little restaurant & tavern located on a peaceful country road in North Allegheny county. My bf took me here on a week day night. We opted for the dining room and the atmosphere is very relaxing and romantic. 

I had the lobster bisque with sherry whipped cream, which was delicious. My bf had the turtle soup which he said was okay. For dinner, I had an arugula salad with poached pears, blue cheese, pumpkin seeds, dried cranberries in a yummy vinaigrette. Jim had a New York strip steak and crab cake served with potatoes and asparagus. I sampled his dinner, (of course) and I thought the crab cake was very good and the steak was very good. 

The best part was dessert. We had the special of the evening, pear cake served with macadamia ice cream and fresh whipped cinnamon cream. It was so amazing! Also, we had dessert coffees, my was hazelnut with Frangelico, topped with whipped cream and hazel nuts. It was very good. 

All in all, a very nice meal. Probably the most obvious thing that was lacking was quality service. When dining at a fine restaurant like the Pines, you expect great service. Perhaps their location makes it difficult to get good servers. 

The Pines tout the fact that they grow many of the herbs and vegetables that they serve right on the premise amongst the landscaping. They also have a small greenhouse to grow baby lettuces and herbs all year round. What they don't grow, they get from local producers that grow organic. They have been in business for 30 years. I am very impressed by that."}
{"text":"Me and the hubby tried this place on Saturday.  It was good but we are not in a hurry to go back.  It seemed to be an older crowd, which is fine.  The dining room was nice with a nice fireplace that was all aglow.  We were a little taken aback entering the dining room.  There is a big desk when entering and the hostess is seated there.  I felt like we were entering a bank.  We were seated next to the wonderful fireplace. The hubby started with the lobster bisque and said it was good but noted it was more of a puree.  I started with the snapping turtle soup.  It was more of a stew but it had great flavor and it had a nice texture.  It was very much like a stew.   I had the fish special, a fried barramundi with cous cous and corn.  It was delightful.  And not really all that fried.  The hubby had a fried fish sandwich and fries.  He enjoyed it but it was not something he will HAVE to get again.  All in all it was a nice lunch but we will most certainly go to other places before going back."}
{"text":"Wonderful dinner last night. 4 of us sat in the bar area. Great atmosphere and service. Menu was everything from fresh fish to comfort food. Very good!!  And great deserts!! The best coconut cream pie ever!!"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon Pines Tavern after hearing good things for our date night. If we didn't have it in the GPS, we probably would have passed it as it blends in with the residential area surrounding it! We made a reservation that morning and were seated as soon as we arrived. It's not super fancy, but it is a nicer restaurant with an old-style ambiance. Our waitress quickly came over and went over drinks. The downside is that non-alcoholic drinks seem to be limited to your normal pop options. I would have enjoyed a non-alcoholic, fancier lemonade or something but they only seemed to have specialty alcoholic drinks. We had the arancini for our appetizer, which was good but not spectacular, though the bacon sauce was amazing! My husband had turtle soup which he really enjoyed. Our entrees were delicious as well - my husband had the meatloaf and I had the grilled scallops and prawns. I do wish there were more than just 2 shrimp and 2 scallops as the meal was $29, but it was very tasty. Then the best part was dessert - I would highly recommend the raspberry pie!!

Overall, we'd come back! The meal was longer (almost 2 hours total for 2 people), but we were on date night and didn't want anything fast. It did seem to have an older clientele/decor, but there were a few families there as well. The bar area actually seemed more crowded than the dining room, so maybe that's where most people go. The entire wait staff was beyond friendly and very accommodating. I'm looking forward to returning in the summer when we can enjoy the patio!"}
{"text":"Fabulous service. Great atmosphere. Enjoyed the piano player! Scallops were delicious. My husband had a pasta special he enjoyed. Shared coconut cream pie and a flourless chocolate ganache cake for dessert - wonderful treat. Was a great dinner to celebrate our 7th anniversary."}
{"text":"Good ambience but ok and expensive. We were a big party and got group appetizers. We have chicken cheese balls, bruschetta, and shrimp cheese pita which was all good. For main entree I ordered salmon fennel, and grilled asparagus. Salmon as dry. Overall too expensive for the experience. Would not recommend."}
