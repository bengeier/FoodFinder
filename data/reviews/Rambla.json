{"text":"Petit resto de tapas très abordable avec de bonnes portions. Les cocktails étaient très bon. Ambiance agréable. J'y retournerai certainement"}
{"text":"It was a good spot, but it was empty on a Friday night at 9pm so a little disappointing in terms of atmosphere. Other than that, great service, tapas were good but simple. I guess it's a good spot to go during happy hour when they have special on sangria and tapas."}
{"text":"One time place, service was bad, menu confusing ( if they put in the boats \"tapas and pinchos\" be sure to have tapas and pinchos  in the menu)  I have to admit the Paella was flavourful and for a plate for two, easy 3 will eat."}
{"text":"We had two of the dishes and one of their wines.   We ordered the paella and it was superbly delicious. It easily feeds 3 people.   Was not a fan of the service. Not because they were rude or anything. They were actually very friendly  I was not a fan because they weren't as attentive as they should be.   Perhaps the essence of the restaurant  is more of a laid back - eat - relax and talk. Which is fine and great if that's the motif. However I would rather have some food to 'picar' while I wait for the actual food."}
{"text":"Great Resto Great service and yummmm! Tapas so elegantly presented and the savoury flavours come out of each dish!presentation was also excellent. Prices were very good also!"}
