{"text":"I've been dying to try this place after seing pictures after pictures if their chicken and I must say, I was not disappointed!!   I've read a number if reviews on how small this place is... and it's definitely very small. Only around 6 tables... They take reservations on weekdays though.  Their price is very good compared to other korean restaurants that even serve less meat. Only $25 for two people! I was thinking that was per person for a minimum order of 2 people!!   The portions are decent. I would say only the braised chicken is enough to be full if you order for the same number of people you have.  We ordered a braised boned chicken for 3 in black sauce. The chicken is good. Very tender and lots of meat. The glass noodles were a little too chewy for my liking (very hard to break apart - can essily choke on it). Not a lot of rice cakes though... we only had 1 sweet potato filled, 2 cheese filled, and around 3 regular ones. There's also only 1 dumpling per person you ordered. I would've expected there be more.  The honey garlic pizza was more like a honey cheese pizza. I barely tasted the garlic. There was also dried cranberries on it which I found weird at first, but it actually went pretty well with the cheese and honey.   Overall 4/5, would come back in the future!"}
{"text":"I visited with my friends. We ordered the black sauce chicken with bones and the red sauce chicken with cheese. We learned that the cheese option goes only with the boneless chicken. The side dishes were pickled radish and salad with vinaigrette. I was surprised that they served the western-style salad instead of the traditional kimchi. Also, the rice bowls were extra. A plate of braised chicken comes with a bunch of things in addition to the chicken. There were glass noodles, dumplings, potatoes, onions, rice cakes, and rice cakes with a cheese filling. I suppose the overall experience was alright. I would point out that one of the potato slices were undercooked. The bones in the chicken were small and often shattered. I would recommend going for the boneless option as the $2 extra is well worth the cost. The cheese made the whole dish somewhat greasy in my opinion, and I would not recommend it. The interior was clean and inviting. The servers were attentive and responsive. The only issue was that there was only one washroom in the restaurant. I have mixed thoughts about this place. Nothing was a deal-breaker for me, but at the same time, nothing appealed to me. I may come back if one of my friends wants to try this place."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. The ambiance was rustic, fun Korean Christmas jams, keeping it festive here with lights too. Newly opened restaurant and the food here is pretty unique, definitely recommend coming here to try their pot of braised chicken. The selection here isn't great though.   Got the large cheese one platter which I liked more than the other ones. Add some fish cakes (recommend) and dumplings (don't recommend) in it too to make it more filling. Basically assorted veggies with pieces of chicken packed with glass noodles in a giant bowl. Definitely good portions and fed us well.   Service was great, got refills on the dilled carrot appetizers without having to ask.  Gave us 3 free pop cuz it was my birthday, try the Crush Pineapple soda!"}
{"text":"Just finished eating here on a cold saturday night around 7pm.  Ordered the White cheese \"black sauce\" chicken for 3, even though we were four people. We asked for slightly more spicy than moderate as well.   The sides:  Pickled radish/peppers/carrots (pretty standard, nothing to rave about but good with saucy chicken dishes).   Salad with sliced almond, cereal (cornflakes??), spring mix, parmesan and balsamic. - eh...the balsamic was good...odd mixture that doesn't really go well together.  App:  garlic cheese pizza - topping could do without the dried cranberry but don't be mislead like we were, the picture shows it as being a pizza, but it's all on a flat tortilla. Not bad though.  The Main dish:  The sauce, the chicken, the rice cakes, the dumplings...just everything was cooked really really nicely. Not too salty or sweet. Seriously yummy and makes you forget the salad and disappointment from the garlic pizza.  Order with a rice to share as it goes nicely with the saucy noodles underneath, but you can definitely eat on its own!  The interior was cute and clean, and I have to say I was really pleasantly surprised by this place. definitely coming back and SOON!"}
{"text":"Location/Service Along Steeles, west of Yonge. Restaurant is inside a small plaza right across Centerpoint Mall (for reference, the same plaza as Kobi Korean Restaurant), at the back corner. Plenty of parking available within the plaza.  Decor inside is relatively simple, comforting vibe - but it is small, probably serving around 20 people or so. Might be a little difficult for big groups - but perfect for 4. Staff could be a little bit more attentive, but overall nice and friendly - also had a chance to chat with the owner for a little bit (about snowboarding though).  Food Menu wise - there's only 3 items to choose from, simple and easy.  They specialized in braised chicken - which is served on a hot plate with vegetables/noodles topped off with a sauce.   Sauces you can choose are black (which is soy sauce based), red (which is spicy red bean paste), or white cheese (either one mentioned topped with mozerella cheese).  Each plate is served with glass noodles, dumpling and rice cake - of course you can add more if you like (extra $ involved) and the chicken can be served bone/boneless.  I tried red sauce and white cheese with black sauce. Definitely the white cheese one is recommended as the cheesiness adds another layering of flavor. The black sauce gives off a bit sweet tasting to it (not a salt soy sauce based) while the red sauce is a little spicy, but a very nice kick. The chicken itself (mostly thigh and breast) is easy to chew on, mixing it in with the sauce adds more flavoring to it. Also liked the dumpling and rice cake.  Overall everything is a comforting meal to taste, we did a 2-person portion for each plate and it filled the 4 of us pretty well. I like these kinda of meals of sharing a giant plate of simple food."}
{"text":"I had never tried authentic Korean style braised chicken until now. I love the interior of the restaurant as it gives a cozy feeling, which makes it a great place to catch up with friends or as a date night.   My first impression of the White Cheese Jjimdak is their large portion size and a generous amount of cheese. They only use fresh organic chicken making the meat very tender.   On the menu there is an option between boned and boneless chicken. I decided to try the boneless and I find that it is very well cooked making it melt in your mouth effortlessly while not being too dry. There are 2 choices for the sauce, black or red, and decided to go with the black sauce. While the sauce is sweet, it doesn't cover its unique taste. I would say this dish is a must try!"}
{"text":"This was the first time I had Korean braised chicken in Toronto. The decor in the restaurant was festive and welcoming. The service was attentive and the waiters were really polite. My friend and I went on Friday at ~7pm and had to wait for ~20mins for a table - understandable since it was prime dinner time!  We ordered the cheese braised chicken in black sauce. The dish had a decent amount of boneless pieces of chicken, mandu, rice cakes (both stuffed and plain), potato, glass noodles and was topped with cheese. It's hard to pin point what the black sauce was, but it was slight sweet with a kick of spiciness (there were pieces of dried pepper in the dish).   Most people in the restaurant got the black chicken dish. But for some reason when we looked around, our sauce was more watery than the other tables. Nonetheless, I still found it tasty and would definitely come again."}
{"text":"I never had Korean braised chicken before; when I first heard of it I was like... What? But Korean fried chicken is so awesome why would I want braised chicken. OK, for a couple of reasons: (1) it's a lot healthier  (2) it's drenched in sauce  (3) you CAN GET CHEESE on top! Oh yes glorious cheese... So good for my lactose intolerant body (and yes I did get cheese and the next day was no good; BUT ITS WORTH IT)  We came here on a Thursday night (2 people) and it was pretty dead. They were going to close in an hour and a half so I figured we beat the dinner rush. We ordered the brown sauce jjimdak with cheese on top and got rice as well (can't remember if it came with it or we had to pay extra..)  One of the first things I was displeased with was the wait time. We waited 40 minutes for our plate of food to come out and they only had another couple sitting in the restaurant at the time eating. I'm not sure why it took so long, can someone tell me if that's normal waiting period for braised chicken?   Secondly, the sauce was way too heavy. I feel like my mouth was getting dry as I was eating it because it was so salty and sweet... I feel like if they toned down the sauce it would be so delicious...  Good things I have to say is that my boyfriend really liked it, the chicken was super soft and easy to chew. We loved all the fun additions in it: rice cakes, oddly.. Thicker glass noodles, slices of potato and SOME veggies (there wasn't a lot really).  It was $35 for both of us; I would say that's a pretty good price because the other restaurants in the same plaza has me spending an average of $50-60 for two people. But think about it, $35 for a plate of chicken and you don't even get a lot of side dishes. I'd rather pay $35 for Korean fried chicken because it's messy and more difficult to make that at home than this dish.  Would I come here again? Only if it was with people who never tried it before. Otherwise you can make this dish at home for much cheaper - and you can control the sodium levels yourself. I am scared to know how much sodium I consumed from that plate of chicken.. O_O;;"}
{"text":"So it's Good Friday around 10:20pm. I called to ask what time the is the last call. They said 10:40, so we rushed over from home. Luckily, we still found one two seater. The honey garlic pizza, the cheese was good, but I think a little too sweet to my liking.   We ordered the red sauce with cheese. I find the inside of the chicken lacks a little flavour, so it relies on the cheese and sauce. I prefer chicken even inside have flavours. The dish have a lot of cheese, clear noodles, carrots, a few dumplings. Quick heavy...if you like chicken with cheese then check it out.  Service was friendly and nice ambiance."}
{"text":"This is my favourite dish from Korea. The jjim dak was flavourful and delicious. The service was friendly and attentive. Would highly recommend and will definitely be coming back to satisfy the craving."}
{"text":"So I saw this new restaurant on my delivery app and it looked interesting so I decided to give it a try. I proceeded to order the Red sauce Jjimdak for 2.  I wasn't sure what to expect since it was the first time for me to be ordering this kind of dish. I was immediately surprised to see this huge aluminium catering tray arrive at my door. Mind you when selecting the size option, I opted for the feed 2 persons size. Quantity-wise, this was a great value dish.  Opening up the tray, I was greeted with a wondrous array of ingredients.   From first glance, I saw many pieces of chicken, onions, 1 FAT-LOOKING Ricecake, many tiny rice cakes, 2 slices of potato, 2 dumplings and a heaping amount of (what i think is) flat arrowroot noodles all covered in the delicious smelling red sauce.  the look of the dish cannot be judged fairly since it was delivery, so i can judge them on that.  the taste, on the other hand, I definitely can.  The chicken was tender and quite tasty with the sauce. The sauce has very added cornstarch viscosity that really coated the chicken well.  The Veggies was great as well. It was soft but still had bite to it, just how I like it.  At the time, I thought there was more of the fat cheese ricecake, but alas, they only include one, which is a huge upset since i didn't get to try it. but my friend did say it was good.  the standout to me was the glass noodles. It was really awesome. It reminded of a more mild but tastier version of the infamous korean fire noodles.  the worst part of the dish was the dumplings. They were absolutely terrible. I Immediately recognize them as the crappy frozen dumplings you get a galleria. BLAGH  If you have the option to remove the dumplings and get more of anything else. I highly recommend you do so.  As this was a delivery order, I can only judge based on taste. I will warrant this place dine in experience.  My final thoughts  The red sauce chicken is a keeper, skip out on the dumplings though."}
{"text":"I'd like to give a 4.5 to this place be we can't always have nice  things...  This Korean styled braised chicken spot is just west of yonge and steeles. My friends and I got here at around 10pm on a Saturday night and there was only one other table seated inside. The inside was well lit and well kept. We were quickly seated and handed a menu as water was provided shortly thereafter. My friends mentioned that there was a slight tea flavour in the water - but it wasn't a significant enough taste to call it tea, it was just warm water to me.   We ordered the black sauce jjimdak boneless for two ($27). Shortly afterwards, the waiter brought the side dishes which was a salad and the classic pickled vegetables. The salad was very fresh and had a bit of cheese as well as balsamic dressing - pretty good for a free salad. The pickled veggies were great as well, some restaurants manage to mess up the picked radishes somehow but the ones here were perfect.  The black sauce jjimdak arrived roughly 15 mins after ordering and it was a pretty big portion. After taking the first bite I realized that I made the dire mistake of not ordering a side of rice ($1.49) with it which I made sure to correct immediately. The rice came right away and the combination between the warm rice and all the braised chicken sauce was amazing. Other than the perfectly cooked chicken, the dish also contained normal and cheese stuffed rice cakes , as well as some slightly flatter glass noodles, potato slices, onions (so good) and two dumplings. I remember two exactly because we were splitting the dish between 3 people, and one of us had to sacrifice. The glass noodles were hard to grab onto as per usual and the dumplings were very similar to soondae (Korean blood sausage) taste and texture wise. Everything in this dish was cooked perfectly and is easily sharable amongst three people - unless of course you're starving and  haven't eaten in a while. This is one of those dishes that you can probably just clean the plate with using rice to grab onto whatever sauce/veggies are left over. I'd give this dish a 4/5 - I just wished that there was more rice cakes, even after ordering extra ($1.49).  The service was pleasant and the waiter made sure to ask us how the meal was. There wasn't a single time where we had to wait on him for too long as he was very attentive.  I'll definitely come by again to see if this place is consistently as good as it was today!"}
{"text":"Since seeing pictures of SsangKye's food on Yelp, I have been itching for weeks to go to this place. And with a big group of friends in tow, I finally got a chance to try it.  The restaurant specializing in Korean braised chicken (jjimdak) is located on the north side of the plaza located one traffic light west of Steeles and Yonge. The restaurant has a cozy and quaint feel to it, with cute strings of lights adorning the windows and walls. The restaurant is pretty small, accommodating approximately 25 people. Although they don't take reservations on weekends, I called ahead to ensure they would be able to accommodate our party of 10 people. When we arrived they were just finishing up setting up our table. I like that they have hooks on the walls and around the windows for coats and bags.   We ordered the large sizes of each of the boneless white cheese black sauce (sweet soy) jjimdak and white cheese red sauce (gochujang) jjimdak. While waiting for our orders, we were served a few small salads to share as well as pickled radish and carrots. The salad included mixed greens, dried cranberries, balsamic dressing, and what seemed like a bit of Parmesan cheese. The pickled vegetables were a little too sugary in my opinion.   Our chicken orders came out about 10-15minutes later. The chicken (which also happens to be organic) was tender, and the braising of the dark meat maintained a nice flavour. There was a feeling of eating something familiar and comforting as the black sauce jjimdak reminded me of a bit of a sweet version of Filipino adobo (with cheese!). The red sauce was moderately spicy for my palate but the addition of cheese helped cool it down. Each of the chicken dishes included cheese rice cakes, dumplings, potatoes as well as flat glass noodles. Although the menu states each large serving of jjimdak can feed 4 people, we easily fed 9 hungry individuals who also shared 5 bowls of rice.   They also sell side orders of glass noodles, cheese stuffed rice cakes, and dumplings, as well as a honey garlic pizza. Soju is also available to wash down your jjimdak. My mouth is watering as i write this review, just thinking about what we ate. Service was on point, food was delicious, and atmosphere was cozy. For all of these reasons, I will definitely be back! 4.25 stars."}
{"text":"I loved having jjimdak during my time in Korea so I was ecstatic when I heard about Ssangkye; its currently the only place in Toronto that specializes in this dish. On their menu are three main options, jjimdak w/: black sauce (soy sauce based), red sauce (gochu-jang based), or white cheese (either black/red sauce topped w/ cheese). The sizes come in small/medium/large, and the chicken can be boned/boneless. My friend and I shared a small boneless white cheese red jjimdak w/ a side of white rice.   The jjimdak came in a pan of braised chicken, glass noodles, dumplings, rice cakes, cheese stuffed rice cakes, potatoes, and onions, all covered in gochu-jang sauce and topped w/ cheese; the resulting savory-ness matched perfectly w/ the rice and was very tasty. The pieces of chicken were also tender and given in generous amounts. I particularly liked how the glass noodles soaked up the sauce, and the implosion of cheese w/ some of the rice cakes. Overall, a solid 4 star dish. And my friend & I were stuffed despite not having lunch & breakfast."}
{"text":"Saw so many friends going to this place so when my friend suggested coming here I jumped on the opportunity. It's a small place at Yonge and Steeles in the same plaza as the Service Ontario and can hold maybe around 20 people max.   Specializing in Jjimdak or Braised Chicken, they have a very small menu where you only need to decide on: 1. Boneless or with Bones 2. Size (Small - 2 people, Medium - 3 people, Large - 4 people) 3. Black sauce (soy-based) or Red sauce (chili paste sauce) 4. Cheese or no cheese 5. Other additions - more glass noodles, dumplings, rice cakes  The pans all come with chicken (obviously), vegetables, glass noodles, dumplings, and rice cakes in the dish which means it's packed with variety and so many different things to eat.   My friend and I got the Small Boneless Red sauce chicken with cheese and no additions and it was more than enough for us when we each had our own bowl of rice. After tax and tip it came out to $44 - Small is $30 and each rice was $1.50 . It had a great taste with a perfect balance of sweet, spicy, and saltiness. I think the only downside was that because there was so much packed into the one pan, it almost felt like it was packed with everything except chicken. However, strictly based on taste, I was very satisfied and happy when I left.  Didn't rate it a 5 because a) feel like my mom could make this at home if she really wanted to and b) I felt like it was slightly overpriced because of the lack of chicken."}
{"text":"We came on a Saturday night and waited for about 30 minutes. The place is cute and cozy but kinda small.  We ordered the large black sauce Jjimdak for four. But it's not quite enough if you are hungry. The chicken is very tender, and the glass noodle is full of flavour. The  cheese rice cake is very tasty as well.  After we finished the jjimdak, we ordered a side dish of tteokbokki, which tastes even better!  The food overall is a bit sweet to my taste, but still very tasty."}
{"text":"Working in Seoul for two years, I fell in love with Jjimdak, and coming back to Toronto, this dish was no where to be found. Then came Ssangkye Braised Chicken House, and I couldn't' have been anymore happier that someone decided to bring this dish to Toronto. We came here with a group 10, the place is very small, with very limited tables, but we were lucky to have found a table within 10 minutes of arriving . We ordered one of each dish to get a true experience of the menu, The Spicy cheese, is a nice twist on the classic, but I would have to say that the Original flavour is my favourite. The garlic pizza is very mediocre, definitely could've been skipped, but for $5.99, why not. The service was great, and waiters there even gave us complimentary pop. The only thing, I would be say is missing here is kimchi, as it was often served with kimchi back in Korea. I'll definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"It's everything you'd expect it to be. A big pan of chicken, potatoes, tteokbokki, onions, noodles and dumplings covered in hot sauce and cheese. What more can you ask for! The menu is very simple. You just choose the type of sauce: black (soy sauce based) or red (spicy) and the option of cheese for extra. They do have other sides you could order or add ons such as more rice cake.  Don't underestimate the quantity, I would say the small is enough for two without the add ons.  If I'm ever craving Korean chicken in hot sauce I'll know where to go."}
{"text":"I've never had braised chicken before.. and I think that was a great place to try it out for the first time! I came here with two of my other friends on a Sunday evening and we were seated immediately. The place was fairly empty other than one table at 10PM  We ordered the black sauce boneless jjimdak, which came with a salad. The salad arrived first and it is mostly greens with a good amount of balsamic dressing on top. It wasn't anything special, but it was still tasty   We got the jjimdak for two, which I thought was the perfect portion for three friends who aren't extremely hungry. The chicken pieces are decent, the cheese rice cakes are bomb! There are also glass noodles hidden underneath everything, and I think if you're on a low-carb diet then this meal should suffice. If not, I would suggest ordering a bowl of rice to eat all the delicious sauce with!  The restaurant has very cozy decor and the servers were really great. We never felt rushed despite still dining in close to their closing time. I want to come back and try the white cheese jjimdak!"}
{"text":"This is a small restaurant that specializes in braised chicken. They use only organic chicken and it was quite tender. The menu is straight forward -  choice of Black (soy sauce) or Red (gochuchang), with choice of mozzerella cheese topping. The chicken comes with glass noodles (flat, similar to Chinese hor fun), dumplings, rice cakes, onions and veg. I had the Black + Cheese and it was delicious! Def want to order a side of rice to eat with the sauce... there's a certain sticky-sweetness in that soy sauce. The cheese makes it quite heavy though so I was quite full til the next morning.   We also got the Honey Garlic Pizza to start and it was bomb! Fresh and hot, strong aroma of garlic with that cheesy goodness and hint of honey sweetness.   Beer is cheap at $4-$6, Soju is $16."}
{"text":"This place is little and cozy. We were comfortable sitting beside the window seats. I was surprised when walked in because we were the only table there at prime dinner time..  The service is good- the waitress was very friendly and tried to upsell us the honey garlic pizza, so we got it just to try it out.  The pizza is more like a hot desert- it was sweet, and crispy, so in general it's pretty good. It's not like anything I've ever had so I liked it but it didn't really overwhelm me that much.   We got cheese jjimdak and it was good- again, never had anything like that before, glad I tried it out, but personally I think it's a bit too sweet for my liking.  I probably will go back if I was ever in that area but I won't drive out of my way for it."}
{"text":"Service was really good. I believe it's a new restaurant as they used to be called Beef. Not that much variety on their menu.   They service hot chicken Plate with an option of red or black sauce. Red being spicy and black being sweet. In that chicken plate theres rice cakes, glass noodle (which was bomb), potato, chicken , and dumplings.   I ordered the white cheese lover which sprinkled cheese on top of the chicken as well."}
{"text":"Just came here on one of the coldest days ever on a Friday night.  When we arrived, there were already 2 tables that were reserved.  The host at the front was pretty reluctant to give us any table and told us that there'd be a really long wait.  We elected to wait and only ended up waiting for 20 minutes.  She also asked us if we wanted to wait outside...biting down my tongue because I didn't want my sarcasm to come off as rude, I withheld saying, \"Sure, let me just literally go CHILL in this -37 degree weather outside\".    The food luckily saved them from poor service up front.  We had the black and the red w/ cheese and both were very good.  The red was moderately spicy and the black was just mildly spicy.  We really liked the black one more because it was full of flavour and went really well with rice.    They also had sides of pickled radish and a salad to accompany.  Both were okay.    Overall, I'd say this is a really good place for a cold winter's night.  Reservations are accepted!"}
{"text":"This review is 3 months delayed ().. so I figured I will combine my 2 visits in this review.  1. January 2018: I came in with 10 people, safe to say we took up a third of the restaurant's available sitting. On this visit, we ordered 1 large black sauce jjimdak (braised chicken) and 1 large red sauce jjimdak, both with ooey gooey cheese.  While waiting for our order (which took about 15-20 minutes), radish & carrot pickles arrived along with green salad (which had shards of almonds & balsamic reduction dressing with sprinkles of parmesan cheese).   When our food arrived, immediately we were introduced to tasty aromas. The black sauce jjimdak was flavoured with sweet soy and red sauce jjimdak was flavoured with gochujang (my fave!!). The chicken was cooked through and infused with different flavours, like it had been marinating for awhile. The addition of melted cheese rounded off the taste and either cut through the spice or soy taste.  2. March 2018: on this visit, I came with 1 other person and we ordered the red sauce jjimdak with cheese in the small size and included an order of cheese stuffed rice cake. While I thought it would not enough, surprised us both because it was plenty for 1 third person.   I'm glad to note that both visits, the servers were helpful and kind. The place had a cosy vibe and Korean music was softly playing in the background.   The only downside, 1 washroom to share."}
{"text":"I love Korean food so I try to go to a new place often. Now let me tell you that THIS IS MY FAVOURITE PLACE SO FAR! we got the spicy red sauce with cheese in size large (white). A group of 3 people shared that and we had leftovers. It was the only thing we ordered. It came with the best glass noodles I ever had, they were THICK! Which I found unusual but great. There was also more cheese served than other places. It was my first time finding potato  slices, dumplings, and cheese filled dokkbolki. The boneless chicken also made it easy to eat. My friend commented that a bowl of rice would go well with this dish to soak up extra sauce. In the future, I would order extra glass noodles and extra rice cakes!!! The spice level was also perfect. Not too spicy but just right! Would highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"My foodie friend was telling me how amazing SsangKye's braised chicken WITH CHEESE was the other day; I have decided to check it out with a bunch of us last night :) Located in the same plaza as Kobi Korean BBQ, MARU HanPan, and Red Bean Waffle House, SsangKye specializes in delicious Korean style jjimdak (braised chicken) dishes!  We ordered a L size pan of jjimdak in white Cheese with red sauce to share. It was SO GOOD. If you are looking for a legit cheese pull, this dish is perfect for you ;) The red sauce is a Gochu-Jang based special sauce (quite mild), and to my surprise, I can actually take the heat! (I think all that cheese really helped too!) I don't eat spicy but I will definitely eat this spicy braised chicken again! The pan also includes veggies, flat glass noodles (yum!), dumplings, rice cakes, and cheese stuffed rice cakes.  The server was very friendly and courteous. The owner also took great care of us and introduced an upcoming new dish that not only has delicious braised chicken but also includes seafood items like shrimp, mussels and crabs. This seafood jjimdak is served in a M size pan (one size) and cooked in only a black sauce. Definitely something to look forward to :)  They also have the Jinro Chamisul Green Grape Soju ($16); try it if you haven't already! One bottle serves up 7 shot glasses. It is sweet and easy to drink, but keep in mind it is 13% alcohol. It is great for sharing with your friends - but tbh - I can down a whole bottle myself lol.  I would definitely come back again to SsangKye for more cheesey jjimdak goodness! It is a great place to catch up with friends over drinks and delicious Korean food."}
{"text":"What a fantastic casual Korean restaurant!  The menu is lean, but boy do they do it well! You basically just come here for braised chicken, and the choice that you have is to decide whether you want it in a red sauce or black bean sauce, and then whether you want to add cheese to it.  The chicken here is organic, and there are yummy rice cakes, glass noodles, potatoes and dumplings inside this braised chicken stew. Totally addictive, totally delicious! Must try!"}
{"text":"I use to live in the Yonge/Finch area for about 4-5 years many years ago. As it were my family doctor is still in the area and I had an appt. although I live out east now coming back to this area reminded me of all the delicious cuisine this area has from Persian to Korean, it's truly a delight for the tastebuds.  After my appointment I got back on yelp and wanted to checkout some \"new\" spots in the area and I stumbled across this gem.  We ordered the \"red\" colour dish with the boneless chicken, it was very tasty with a bit of a bite.  It also came with a salad that was really good. The portions are huge so be careful how much you order.  The service was also excellent, the place is small and isn't really for large groups.  Would definitely go back and try some of the other items specifically the garlic pizza which did look delicious."}
{"text":"This place is the definition of comfort food for me. As if the chicken couldn't get any tastier, it does when you throw on the cheese! We had the red sauce boneless chicken with cheese for two. With tax and tip, everythinf came up to about $35 which is fair for the amount, and the deliciousness, of the food.   Only criticism I have is that there was about 5 pieces of rice cake and only 1 cheese filled rice cake. Although the food filled me up (to the brim), I would easily trade a couple pieces of chicken for some more of those!!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came here, curious and hungry after seeing several grams of their jjimdak, a dish consisting of chicken braised/steamed in Korean soy sauce with veggies and potato noodles. It appears that they retained much of the decor/furniture from their predecessor (Beff Steak).  The complimentary appetizers consisted of simple greens dressed in balsamic vinaigrette and some pickled daikons/carrots; nothing special. We got the honey garlic pizza, which was a very interesting dish---light, sweet (dried cranberry, honey) balanced with savoury (garlic, cheese) and quite enjoyable, but probably not for everyone (looking at you, Hawaiian pizza haters).  Our White Cheese Jjimdak arrived and I was pleasantly taken aback. For something designated \"small\" and recommended for two, it was very generous for portions. Delicious chunks of tender chicken immersed in a viscous dark soy sauce with veggies and hot pepper chunks, along with rice cakes, dumplings, and glass noodles---all under a glorious layer of melted cheese. I don't recommend eating it by itself; get rice and preferably some alcohol. It is a worthy partner to soju. I also don't recommend getting the cheese rice cake add-on if you're getting the white cheese variant; it becomes inconsequential.  Overall, a significant improvement over Beff Steak. I will be back with friends to get a large, perhaps loaded with mandu. I would like to see smaller portion options, more variety, and potentially half flavour options. Recommended."}
{"text":"Sharing is Caring! What's better than sharing hot and steamy Korean Brasied Chicken with your friend? (Yup. They are in S/M/L size and the small size serves 2. So bring someone! Or I guess you can come alone and pack the leftover home!)  SsangKye Braised Chicken House serves up the taste of Korean: Jjimdak. A choice of Black, Red and White Cheese sauce. Though one might think the organic chicken is the star, but I love the glass noodle, rice cakes (which I secretly ate most of them especially the cheese stuffed ones), and dumplings!   They are also working on a Spicy Challenge. Imagine Caroline Reaper and Ghost Pepper to spice up your chicken?! I have to warn you, it is HOT and please proceed with caution.  Not too many Jjimdak specialty place in town, SsangKye is worth a visit and find out what  is really Korean food taste like."}
{"text":"I'm happy that this place is in a plaza that actually has a parking lot. We came on a Monday night (family day) for dinner because we saw this place featured on BlogTo so wanted to give it a try. The restaurant is pretty small and during peak times it would be hard to get a seat for sure. We didn't have to wait (party of 5). It's nice and cozy. By the windows they have string lights on with polaroids and I thought that was cute. We ordered black sauce, white cheese (red), cheese rice cakes add ones for both and green grape soju.  The chicken for both dishes were relatively small pieces but there was a decent amount to go around. Both come with dumplings, glass noodles, rice cakes, and cheese stuffed rice cakes.  Black sauce: doesn't look appetizing but don't judge it by its looks. I think this one was better then the spicy one. Maybe cause of the sauce? Sweet soy? Not sure but the glass noodles complemented that really well.   White cheese (red): you have the option to get black or red sauce. Black I assume would be the same as above. Red is spicy and that is similar to what they use for rice cakes. I prefer the rice cakes in the red sauce over black. Cheese on top was oozy.   Both dishes had a LOT of onions in it. Dumplings were a little soggy but expected of this type of dish. Generally was decent food. As a whole, I liked the glass noodles the most LOL not the chicken. It is a place to try if you've never had braised chicken before and our service was great!  3* for food 4* for service"}
{"text":"Small restaurant with very limited seating... So you might need to wait during peak times. Overall it is a lot smaller than expected and definitely the speciality is the braised chicken. Ordered the braised chicken with dark sauce and cheese. It takes a bit of time to get here but the appetizer seem to take forever to come out and the tea that was served was cold, which they claimed their machine was broken.   The chicken was suppose to be for 3 but not sure if it would actually feed 3 adults. The flavour was ok but nothing spectacular, initial impression seem like soya sauce chicken with a little more spice to it. Even though it was a non spicy dish it did have some chili in there. Uniqueness it is different from a typical Korean restaurant but not so sure what I really think of it or if it is worth a second shot."}
