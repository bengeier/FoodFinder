{"text":"I had high expectations but was let down. The quality of food was nothing special. For the price I paid, I could get much more food at restaurants that prepare from scratch. I felt ripped off after paying my bill."}
{"text":"I have been here on several occasions, it's feels like coin flip every time I come here because there are times when the food taste good (4 stars) and there's days when it just doesn't feel fresh or clean (1 star).

What makes me give them one star is an experience I once had here on my birthday. I had 15 people join me for a birthday lunch on a weekend.  At the time, it was my group and about 4 other customers in the restaurant.  There were however, close 15 people who made up a huge band, THIS IS NOT A CONCERT VENU, they were not on a stage, but next to customer tables.  They did not work for the restaurant by the way. We had small children and they nor the staff cared to consider how rude the level of noise they were making was, we had a trombone near one of my guests! We asked for the bill, I only paid half and left the place.  NEVER COMING BACK"}

{"text":"This was the worst seafood I had ever tasted plus the waiters took long and we talk to the manager and then the waiters was like wtf so then we just left. I would recommend not to come here just a waste of time and money."}

I'll shut up now, thanks to Las Islas. 

First of all, I must say the prices are VERY affordable. $3 beers and full plates that will leave you stuffed for as low as 8 bucks. 

My chimi was gargantuan and very enjoyable...there's no way I could finish this whole thing AND all the sides it came with. I love the beans!

The ceviche tostadas were sweeter than I expected, but they were LOADED and pretty good. 

I had bite of my friend's fish, featured in my photos. Very savory, tons of garlic, thoroughly delicious. 

The atmosphere is also very good. There's a sort of a lounge in the back with the pool table, and lots of live music. You will feel welcomed and you will have fun, especially if you are hanging out with paisas. B-) 

I don't have seafood cravings often, but this is a good place to satisfy them. Just keep in mind that if you don't like seafood, it's cool that there's plenty of stuff without it. What's not cool, however, is that it's all prepped in the same place, and your meal is probably going to taste fishy no matter what. Although I enjoyed my chimi, it was very obviously fried in the same oil as everything else! Minus one star! But other than that, this place is solid."}
{"text":"We live a short walk from here and decided to give it a try.  It wasn't half bad, but it wasn't much more than half good.

The establishment is great if you like aquatic themes and some good blasting Banda music (I hope I'm not confusing my genres...).  I'm fond of both, so that was a plus.  The place was generally clean, and the place grew progressively busier, including couples and families.

The menu was large but not overwhelming.  They offered a variety of seafood.  Not much else, so if you don't like seafood...don't go?  I love seafood, so, again, good.  I tried something new: Pescado a la Veracruzana.  I thought it was pretty good, but I have no comparison point...my dinner date ordered some tacos with a side of beans and rice.  They didn't have much to say, but not because their mouth was full and tummy happy.

I would say the portions seemed rather small for what was provided.  There were complimentary chips and salsa.  The salsa was good, but not awesome.  I did like that they refilled our chips and that the first basket had limes.  They also provided a shrimp soup in a styrofoam cup.  We had no idea what it was but the waitress answered when we asked and it was very yummy.  But, again, not for the anti-fishy type.

Service was meh.  I think they didn't care as much since we didn't look like we spoke Spanish (and yes, I do), which is fine, I'm there for the food, but it doesn't earn any gold stars (or red in the case of Yelp :P ).  I also seemed a bit slow considering there weren't that many people there.  The time it took to come back and take our order, for example, seemed to take a looong time to arrive. And then the second basket of chips.

I don't regret going, but I'm not feeling so inclined to, at least not until I've explored around some more.

On a random note, we had to bands, Mariachis I suppose, one of four and one of two, roam in, but neither stuck around (I guess everyone was too cheap to request a song)."}
