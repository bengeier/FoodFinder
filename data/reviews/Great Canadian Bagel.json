{"text":"A decent alternative to Tim's or McDonalds for a breakfast sandwich (especially if you are not a salt fiend).  The range of bagels is better, and they are very nicely toasted crisp. The fillings in the supreme egg bagel are not saut√©ed, leaving them a bit underwhelming, which drops this from four stars to three."}
{"text":"I am actually not much of a bagel person, but I happen to live less than a block away from this place, so I find myself there quite often.   The people who run the place are so lovely and they really take care to make the inside of the place comfortable and welcoming.   The bagels are great - Wednesdays you can get a dozen for $6, which is a great deal for freshly baked bagels with assorted flavours.   They have breakfast sandwiches that are cheap and quick in the morning featuring bacon, sausage or  western-style veggie mix. Unfortunately, these are prepared in the microwave and thus are not the best quality, but they still do the trick most mornings!  The Great Canadian Bagel does bagels well - but that's about it. The salads aren't really salads so much as a head of lettuce in a yogurt container, and the soups aren't the freshest I've had either.   I do LOVE this place despite it's problems because I appreciate a quick and easy place to carbo-load for the day ahead!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for bagels in Calgary. The quality is always good and good value. It seems to be a family run business which I think helps add to the consistent good quality and service. Who doesn't like supporting well run local family businesses? My favorite item on the menu is the lox bagel."}
{"text":"In the sea of so many other restaurants along 17th, this one is a bit harder to find, at the end of the block.  Nice that they have their own parking spots too.  Love the booth seating here, it's very spacious for not just a bagel place but for a restaurant too.  friendly service; the owners will be selling by Jan so get your smoked salmon soon!  new owner, new concept."}
{"text":"I was once a Montreal resident, so that instilled an organic bagel craving inside.  The Great Canadian Bagel is just down the street from me and it sells over 18 types of bagels plus has a nice Wednesday special of a dozen bagels at $6.99.  Today I tried both a roast beef bagel and a roasted chicken bagel; one I tried on a spinach and feta bagel the other on a blueberry one.  Each one was a little over $5.  They were both very good, not as good as Montreal bagels but filling enough and very tasty.  Both were toasted for me and fresh ingredients were added to my liking.  I also was inspired by the 12 or more choices of cream cheeses.  There is a great option of 8 bagels and 1 selection of cream cheese at $8.95 which I will return to try one day.  This establishment has an internet option as well; there are 5 computer monitors that people can rent for $2.00 an hour.  This I will make a note of in case my internet server decides to crash on me in the future.  The only criticism I had about the place was it was extremely messy; there was tons of evidence from previous customers at the bar by the window and at various tables in the restaurant.  There were two attendants working today but there was only myself and another woman inside. So the place could use better upkeep especially with the slushy footprints that existed everywhere on the floors inside.  I was really glad I wasn't eating in today otherwise I don't think I would have enjoyed my bagels as much.  Minus two stars for the mess."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Service was fast and polite. Had a breakfast bagel and it was super tasty, sister had the butter chicken and it was very good as well. Prices are reasonable, there's just no going wrong here!"}
