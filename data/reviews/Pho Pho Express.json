{"text":"Cards on the table - I LOVE Vietnamese food BUT I didn't have Pho which is what people seem to like them for.  Servers were wonderfully nice.  The menu is very limited (as behooves an express place, I guess) and missing some odd things such as shrimp on sugar cane and avocado shakes.   I had a couple of menu items - the deep fried shrimp wonton (called dumplings on the menu) were boring -- too much fried wonton wrapper.  Then I had my go-to Vietnamese dish - lemongrass beef on vermicelli.  Yeee-uck.  It was like someone had tried to create the dish based on having heard about it in a game of telephone,  The beef was not grilled, although tender, it had a cornstarch kinda sauce on it with a lot of cooked onions(?).  There were no peanuts or coriander, but there were sliced dill pickles??? with the carrots and daikon...  the vermicelli was very thin, soppy and stringy with no chew. The lettuce was a mesclun mix (not dire in itself, but it really didn't go) and there was no lemongrass. Even the fish sauce seemed watery and tasteless. Odd and very unpleasant - in fact it might have been the worst thing I've had in a restaurant in years.  Other people assure me that there are great things on the menu (viz. the Pho), but I will not be returning to find out."}
{"text":"Delicious bursts of flavours in all the food I tried. Char Siu was about the best I have have, the shrimp noodles were outstanding, and my kids loved the assortments of bubble tea.  Definitely suburbia, located in a strip mall North of North of Toronto. Certainly off the beaten track and somewhat hard to find, but if you are in Newmarket looking for some great asian cuisine then you may want to give it a try.  Clean modern enveironment, with high ceilings and lots of windows.  http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=17235+Leslie+Street+newmarket+ON&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=63.600521,55.722656&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=17235+Leslie+St,+Newmarket,+York+Regional+Municipality,+Ontario,+Canada&ll=44.051416,-79.425616&spn=0.028747,0.027208&z=15"}
{"text":"The only thing that bursted was in fact, the lack of flavour.  Probably a good thing that it's hard to find and that it's off the beaten track."}
{"text":"Pho Pho Express has a gateway drug.  After a few visits for a nice hot bowl of Pho, the owner gave me a sample of his new offering--a lemon chicken wing appetizer.  They were extremely tasty, a lemony, crisp skin laced with spiced salt.  Delicious.  Soon I was ordering the wings and Pho as a regular.  I walked in the other night and a couple of the employees greeted me with \"you want wings?\".  That was the night that I asked the owner if I could just get a larger order of the appetizer wings.  He agreed, but since this was just a holdover snack, i skipped the soup.  So I went from a two wing sample to an oversized order as a light main course. If I could figure out how to mainline these wings...  Don't think that they are a one trick pony.  The soups are always excellent and filling, and I especially enjoy the spicy thai noodle soup.  Ask for it mild or let them crank it up to a level that will peel paint, it is still flavourful. For under $10 you can do some serious damage to your hunger!"}
