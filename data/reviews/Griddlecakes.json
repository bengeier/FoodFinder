{"text":"This is one of my favorite little breakfast spots in town. Their pancakes are amazing, the coffee is strong, and the service is pretty good! The only thing I don't love about it is that sometimes the people working will congregate near the drink fountain, and some of their conversations can get a bit inappropriate. They look like they're all in high school or college, so I understand that kind of behavior, but it would be nice if it wasn't out in full view of the patrons."}
{"text":"The razzle dazzle griddle cakes were awesome. Rating is good for the food.   The wait staff didn't seem too happy to be working on a Sunday though. I don't blame them I guess. They forgot my bacon which comes with the plate and when I pointed it out the waitress responded \"I don't know what you ordered\", took the plate back and took another 10 minutes to bring it back."}
{"text":"It's always nice when there's a gluten free menu section but not when its executed so poorly. The gluten-free pancakes were not cooked, barely solid. The waiter didn't know because he never asked. In fact he never said anything. The rest of my food was just ok. The home fries are unseasoned and my eggs not hot. My friends pancake was lemon blueberry (not gluten free) and she liked them. Not going back but more because the service made me feel uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Went there recently. Wow. What a gem! It's a small place and weekends gets packed.   We had red velvet pancakes, lemon blueberry pancakes, a free pancake (Yelp check in) and also biscuits and gravy. It was a ton of food and we took home more than half of it. I thought the price was more than justified.   It's a nice place but I would recommend going there during the week. If I can make it work during the week, would definitely go!"}
{"text":"The red velvet pancakes do not make up for the more than half an hour wait for drinks that we had to order three times, the inattentive wait staff nor the cold breakfasts that were delivered to our table! People who were sat twenty minutes after us were served quicker and another patron had to direct the waitress to my table when she failed to stop at our table yet again."}
{"text":"I hesitate to give The Griddle 3 and not 4 stars. I wish 3.5 was an option.   The staff was helpful, the Orange Juice tasted like it had been juiced on the spot, and they had no problem making my order custom (I basically invented a sandwich and they didn't bat an eyelash).  Prices are decent. The place is sortof cute. Something is missing or else this would get 4 stars. It doesn't quite feel... cozy. Maybe because the doors are open and it was freezing, or maybe because the layout is awkward. I'm not sure. But it has potential. Worth a shot."}
{"text":"Keep coming back for more. Never a bad meal nor a bad day with these servers. Food & Service always SUPERB."}
{"text":"Food is good, but expensive. I ordered food, without several things, and paid full price still. I had kids and they didn't have whip cream. None of these automatically qualifies for a discount, but a plate of eggs without hash browns or toast, and 2 orders of pancakes without frills, isn't worth almost $50.  Service was excellent."}
{"text":"We had a scramble that came with biscuits and gravy and a burger with tortilla soup. Large portions and great quality of food. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Now that I just joined Yelp I have to post a review since I came here after my lash appt!   Food was delicious! I was quick to be seated and the food was home cooked and amazing! I got a cheese omelette with avocado and home fries! Reasonable prices and delicious! Highly recommend. Place is very clean and busy which is a good sign."}
{"text":"Good food and service. Was pleased that they serve FRESH squeezed orange juice. Food was fresh and served fast. Appreciate that it was a small cafe so the servers could attend to you in a timely manner!"}
{"text":"Wow came back to Vegas after a few years hoping to have my favorite burger at Rambos Kitchen. To my surprise Rambos is gone. How sad this place rocked and the food was down good. So I tried the new joint it's ok but dull and the food was somewhat tasteless. I won't come back. Rambos I miss you. So sad."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The food is on point, great service, great prices, & very clean! I would recommend GriddleCakes to anyone!"}
{"text":"Consistently perfect omelets and service. And omg the red velvet pancakes are fantastic."}
{"text":"If i could I would give negative stars. Don't count on a 2pm close time.... they closed 20 minutes early today. Not the best way to get new customers."}
{"text":"My favorite place in LV for breakfast.  The chicken fried steak is enough for 2.  And the pancakes are giant and yummy"}
{"text":"Was there with my girlfriend this morning. Decided to check out this place after finding out Crepe Expectations was closed for several days. Walked in, and were told we could sit anywhere. So we grabbed a booth, waited for 20 minutes, and after watching another man who had walked in after us get served while we had not been given so much as a water or menu, and we walked out and went up the street to another place.   TL;DR: Poor service, never returning."}
{"text":"My first time here and I can't wait to go back. If you love pancakes, this is your hidden gem. My server was so sweet and gave me good suggestions on what to try. I was torn between two pancakes and asked if she could decide for me. Best decision ever. She chose the funfetti and I ate the whole thing!!! She suggested the combo as I wanted eggs and unsold me on adding cheese. The busser kept my drinks full which is very important to me. Thank you Griddkecakes."}
{"text":"The restaurant was very dirty and smelled intensely of bleach & cleaner (ironic).  The hostess/waitress tried to seat us at a table that was not clean, and had food on the floor underneath it. I pointed out the mess - and she seated us at another not so clean table. A few moments later she seated another couple at the same dirty table, without any effort at cleaning up the mess I had just pointed out to her. My friend and I spent a few minutes contemplating the menu, but the strong smell of bleach/cleaner was so overwhelming we both lost our appetites and decided to leave. Restaurants should smell like food, not cleaner - yet the place was filthy. Many tables had not had their dishes removed; there was food all over the floor; the table was sticky; my friend had to brush bits of food off her chair before she could sit down; the menus were sticky and were marked all over with a marker (?); the waitress could care less.  I tried to find a company website, but I don't think the owners of this business care about customer service.  Except for the pawn shop, every other business in this strip mall is closed - it feels like a place that has given up. Very sad. I try to support local, but at least with a chain there is a corporate office you can contact with concerns (dirty restaurant = dirty food = people get sick) and even the too big to fail chains respond to issues.  The health department needs to do a drive by."}
{"text":"Stay away.  First and foremost, the waiter told us to f*** off.  I came on here to check out the reviews, and quite honestly they are pretty spot on.  Food was terrible.  Sausages were raw, eggs were under-cooked, and pancakes came out 15 minutes before the rest of the meals.  We even ordered chicken and waffles, but cancelled the order after 45 minutes.  Waiter said they just were warming it up....  We also had a sausage patty that was burned beyond recognition, to which the waiter told us that's how its done, and refused to take it back.  Only giving 1 star because we got our drinks from the waitresses fast and they were okay."}
{"text":"Ivan was of great service, prompt, friendly, and food was great! First time here and we enjoyed our experience. The griddle platter was delicious along with the red velvet hot cake (yum). We didn't come during prime time, we arrived around noon which allowed us to be seated quickly. We will be returning again and will be recommending this place."}
{"text":"Found them on Yelp for Breakfast and Definitely did not disappoint! Great food, great service and a great atmosphere!  Definitely making this a regular stop when I'm in Vegas on business."}
{"text":"Don't eat here.   I got the skillet breakfast and the potatoes that come with it were more like boiled in oil, instead of nice and crispy...no flavor in the veggies that were over the potatoes, I guess you have to salt it to your taste. We waited too long to be asked to order because it was very busy. OH...and the coffee mug...grimy, with a small hair stuck to it. It's just a bunch of inexperienced people that have to many orders to cook."}
{"text":"The Griddle is a great place to have breakfast. The pancakes are delicious, best I've come across so far in Vegas. The french toast was also good, with generous sprinkles of cinnamon. Even though it is in a large shopping center, it manages to still be a quaint, little breakfast joint. Its nice to sit outside in one of the 4 patio tables. Inside, its small but service when we went was quick, friendly and fabulous."}
{"text":"It was our first time coming in. We ordered 2 Lumber Jack combos which consisted of 2 pancakes, 2 eggs and 2 strips of bacon or sausage link or patty, I myself had the links which were really good. The pancakes were on the spot and the portions are very generous. We love cafes and this is now one of our favorite little spots! Service is very attentive and prompt! Staff was very nice!"}
{"text":"I just recently went to griddle cakes and had the best breakfast. The servers were really professional and  fast. The restaurant is a little compact but the food is so good and fresh you won't disappointed. It's a great breakfast spot and I give em 5 stars"}
{"text":"First time was a few weeks ago and we've been once a week since then. Every time we go we have great food and good service. I love how casual and family friendly it feels."}
{"text":"I ordered the lemon-blueberry hoecakes with crab cake eggs Benedict. Both were AMAZING!! I would have given 5 stars but the service leaves a lot to be desired. I will come back and try again!!"}
{"text":"Too expensive for breakfast I can get somewhere else cheaper and better. Stay away from this place."}
{"text":"I would not normally give this type of star as much as possible but this place is not what I expected it. To start with the name changed to Stacks and Yolks. The place looked like it was cheaply renovated. It was our first time and we normally ask the waitress what the specialties are and she doesn't know said she was new. Ok cool, maybe someone else does?? The food is not bad but probably not very sanitary right after we left the place he had a weird stomach sensation another hour later he was already throwing up and having diarrhea, the doctor said could have been food poison and now he's taking Flagyl for 7 days. I could be wrong but I'm not taking any chances, not coming back to this place."}
{"text":"Ate here yesterday for the first time.  Waiter with the dark glasses and curly hair was awful and terribly rude. His actions showed clearly he didn't want to wait on me.  Perhaps it was because I was the only one with different skin. The food was ok but the service sucked. I will not be returning again as that waiter does not need to be servicing people in this day and age of diversity."}
{"text":"This has been our new go-to breakfast spot lately. We used to go to Egg Works all the time but we enjoy the healthier options at Griddlecakes. Their pancakes are excellent too though! If you're in the mood for biscuits and gravy I wouldn't have them here. It's the only thing I'm not a big fan of.  The potatoes here are so good! Nice big chunks with more of a roasted flavor. I love the the Gobbler skillet, it's my go-to. My husband likes the veggie scramble (gluten-free). Our food always comes out piping hot! *Expect a wait on Saturday & Sunday because of the car show & farmers market."}
{"text":"Very bad experience. . Doubt I'm coming back. . My server didn't knew what she's was doing  took over 45 min to bring food to the table.really just for chorizo and eggs. Never refilled drinks. Coffee.And brought me up the wrong order to the table ..and it wasn't not even busy..I understand if the restaurant is full.. and on top of that at the moment to pay they over charged me on my cc. Really..!!!   I didn't say anything I just wanted to get out of there.. thanks sadie if that's your name.. We never coming back. Thanks to you."}
{"text":"As a connoisseur of breakfast food this place is sublime.  To say that their red velvet pancake is anything other than a paragon among pancakes would be criminal.  I kid you not, I went to eat there with my debbie-downer friend who said it was \"so-so\" and he was immediately arrested by the breakfast police.  Their omelettes are on point and creative.  What about their steak tips you ask?  They're awesome.  Thinking about that OJ?  So fresh.  Also, the staff there gets their food out so fast it would make Jon Taffert's head spin.  Just try it'll become your weekly spot."}
{"text":"Ok, so this review below was in my\"drafts\".  I went there over a year ago....  I hit post and now don't know how to delete.  Oh well.   The food was good, nothing to write home about.   The servers were polite, but the food took forever!!!!  We were sat at a table rather quickly, and ordered our food within 10 minutes, but waited 45 minutes for it to come out.   If you have young kids, it is nice because they have a play area, but still exhausting.  My son and husband was starving after an hour if waiting."}
{"text":"Amazing food for breakfast!! Great staff, Hamed is a great guy and I'm glad to work right down the plaza from him!! You guys should really go check them out!"}
{"text":"First off let me say i have been a server for years so for the one star it had to be bad, and I'm sitting in the restaurant as I write this review. Service was bad and the food was horrible. My eggs benny was raw and mushy, French Toast was plain and boring, and when I told the waiter about the benedict he said \"ok\" took the plate and walked away!  Didn't ask if I wanted some thing else or apologize at all.  I've eaten here before and food was good but looks like a new staff combined with a new name on the door had made this place horrible. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Boom. The Griddlecakes empire continues with a hometown Vegas twist.  Their Fresh OJ is the undisputed best in town."}
{"text":"Went there this week was very disappointed. Service was slow with only 3 other tables in the restaurant and plenty of staff. Me and 3 other friends went. Took 35 minutes for breakfast and then when we finally got are food they served two of are dishes first. Wares 2 mins for only one more dish. Then finally 5 minutes after that are last member of are group got his food. The have no alcohol which is ok but after having a fun night out a mimosa would be nice. Everything tasted like came out of a can and not fresh food. Never will be back and would not recommend to anyone. We were there 8/15/2013. Hit crapes next to it we did the next day was delicious and fresh and had mimosa."}
{"text":"Sunday breakfast is a tradition for my bf, my sister, her bf and I. We've tried so many different places but lately we've been hooked on this place.  We always seem to have the same server who is friendly and attentive. I love how the food is always fresh and doesn't leave a big grease pile on my plate from the potatoes. The pancakes are huge and really fluffy. They have outdoor seating so we are even able to bring our dog."}
{"text":"We were looking for gluten free pancakes and found them here. The service was great. The staff was very attentive and friendly. We shared an omelet and the gluten free pancakes. The omelet was nice and fluffy. The pancakes had great texture and flavor. The coffee was great, too. The only downside was it was kind of noisy. This was a great find."}
{"text":"Take it from a guy who has nearly made it his life goal to explore the various hidden breakfast  gems in the Las Vegas / Henderson valley. Now, I have thoroughly examined and assessed every review on Yelp regarding GriddleCakes ranging from Amazing to awful, however, I have yet to find an accurate description to acquiesce the fact that \"good\"'or \"bad\" reviews even exist. Simply put, GriddleCakes is relegated to neither categories in which it is claimed. GriddleCakes is its own special entity whose Identity need not be subject to opinion. Fact. It is a fact that GriddleCakes is its own, indescribably remarkable establishment. When you walk through those doors, it takes no time to realize that this is not your typical cafe. This family-operated phenomenon has the unique, diverse multicultural \"zing\"  while maintaining an extraordinarily cozy, home-like atmosphere that really, in itself,  is a spot that a simple cup of freshly brewed coffee can be enjoyed in solace followed by a genuine conversation with someone who isn't just there to serve you eggs. I mean, you walk into this place and you know you are where you need to be. Their quality of food could go from extraordinary to just great and it would still surpass the rest. No review can do justice, no picture, no comment, no opinion. GriddleCakes, like the Grand Canyon, Cosmos, The Great Pyramids of Egypt or The Northern lights, are indescribable experiences that must be just that; experienced. Do yourself a favor. Go Get GriddleCakes. You will never look back."}
{"text":"I didn't enjoy my breakfast here at all. Nothing seemed to be made from scratch. I  think it was all premade frozen food. I could have made a better breakfast at home."}
{"text":"Looking at the positive reviews, I wonder if we ate somewhere else. We had their grilled cheese and breakfast sandwich. Cheese on both was horrendous, as if it came out of a can. Bacon was average at best. English muffin was dry. Potatoes were below par. Grilled cheese again tasted like something out of a can or a spread - I mean if it tastes wet something isn't right, was melted to a consistency like a fondue.   Service was also disappointing. Small restaurant was crowded with 3 waitresses working the floor. We asked for water and napkins which were forgotten about for over 5 minutes. When I left I had the disgusting liquid cheese and pieces of our sole napkin stuck to my fingers. After complaining about the cheese, the waitress was helpful and had a new sandwich with cheddar (as opposed to American) prepared. For this one reason, we give 2 stars.   With many good breakfast and lunch places in the neighborhood (even in the same strip mall), will not return."}
{"text":"Wonderful, friendly, accommodating customer service! Nice atmosphere.   The coffee kept coming and was good, but the food was underwhelming: Biscuits and gravy were mediocre, griddlecake was dry, not golden brown or fluffy. See photo."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time because I heard from a couple friends of mine that it was better than our usual joints which include, Egg works,  Sunrise Cafe and Hash House A Go Go, all of which I FREQUENT. I must say that after trying Grddlecakes, I doubt I will ever be going to any of those places again. Grddlecakes is the best of all words, its items are original and OUTSTANDING and the service was excellent. Soooo gooood..."}
{"text":"I ate at The Griddle 2 mornings in a row, once with my husband, once with my MIL who LOVES a good, big breakfast. The service is passible, the staff isn't super-quick and we had to flag him over a few times for refills.  The food is excellent, tho! We both ordered the Lumberjack, and once I ordered bacon, the next AM, the sausage patty. GET THE SAUSAGE PATTY! It was beyond delicious! The bacon was dissappointing, soggy limp and pre-cooked. The cooks know how to make a perfect over-medium egg, and that's big in my book. The home fries tasted and felt like they were cooked in bacon grease, but that's GOOD! They were really delicious. The pancakes were the best part of breakfast, tho! They tasted NOT from a mix batter, but from scratch. A bit tangy with buttermilk, they were massive, fluffy and chewy. They serve real butter here for them, but maple-flavored syrup. (none of the REAL stuff, sad to say)  I like the food beeter here, than at The Origional Sunrise Cafe, just a few blocks away. They make a MUCH tastier pancake, and really good coffee, too!  I'm be going alot more in the future, I know it! BTW, the picky family members I took loved it as well, even more than I did!"}
{"text":"The food I ordered was okay, not the best I had. What I had was way overpriced for what I get! The tiny cup of $1 fruits (only a couple of slices of strawberries and banana), charged extra $1 for egg white only omelette. It was just a normal serving size food with jalapeños, turkey sausage, onions, tomatoes and cheese.   The first waitress with tattoos and facial piercings was kinda rude, she the one who took my order. I politely asked her when she get the chance to refill my water. She didn't even come by to refill my water or asked how I was doing until I was done writing up my cheque, and I had 3 or 4 different waiters throughout my time at the table and I'm wasn't even sure who was my waiter anymore.  This was my 2nd visit to this place and I don't think it is worth going back for the subpar service and expensive food that isn't best in town."}
{"text":"Was looking for another restaurant when we came across the griddle . Sooo glad we did. Good coffee. Had a skillet and tried the pancakes. Way to many potatoes and not enough other ingredients on the skillet. The pancakes were fluffy and yummy and huge!  The biscuits in the biscuits and gravy were super fresh so they kinda turned into mush and not a lot (if any) sausage in the gravy. The wait staff was very attentive and interactive with the guests. I had a great experience and will go back to try more."}
{"text":"Service was great, food was fine. I will for sure be back to try some of their specials."}
{"text":"I have been to Griddle Cakes about 1/2 dozen times in the last three months. They consistently have a good breakfast. The Lumberjack Meal and the Mexican Huevos are my two favorite dishes. There pan cakes are large and taste good; I'm satiated after eating one pancake."}
{"text":"Im not sure what all the hype is about this place.  No specialty dishes, simple menu & just ok food. Servers are all very friendly but not enough to keep me coming back. I ordered a single red velvet pancake, scrambled egg whites & turkey sausage Side Note: they don't have turkey bacon? Why not have both? Hmm whatever I guess. They brought out a buttermilk pancake :( nooo sir, red velvet. I know this wasn't my error because I've heard nothing but wonderful things about their red velvet & was looking forward to trying them. Server kindly took it back & brought back the red velvet one. No biggy it happens.  Now don't get me wrong it was alright. Pretty tastey but i'll be honest, I enjoy iHops red velvet a heck of a lot better. Personal preference though. This just wasn't sweet enough.   Like I said, nothing special about this place, very standard cafe with ok prices."}
{"text":"It's worth the wait! The chicken and waffles are amazing and they design the waffle like a flower. The skillets are yummy and the omelets are tasty. Just going on a Sunday morning will be crazy but come early or be patient because the food is excellent!!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant!! The food is awesome and the service is great.  Perfect for breakfast and lunch!!"}
{"text":"1st time in here and probably would be last. When we first got in, we were told to wait 10-15mins which was fine, but then they told us they don't have silverware we have to wait until they washed them. I mean wow really?! A restaurant doesn't have enough sliver ware, that's not quite acceptable, not enough glass ware as well. They were serving us fresh squeeze orange juice in a paper cup. Food was ok, average. At the end, the cashier gave us a check that didn't add up!  That's a joke!  Overall experience wasn't pleasant. We are probably not going back again."}
{"text":"For a comfort breakfast this is one of the better places in town. Service is just right. Home fries are just the way I like them, off the skillet not out of the fryer."}
{"text":"Very good family run restaurant, good price for the value. For a hearty, filling breakfast it's hard to beat."}
{"text":"Awesome place to have breakfast! Their skillets are amazing and the home fries are delicious! A little small but still easy to get a seat.  My new favorite for breakfast."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place because it a couple minutes from my house and I was thrilled to have this breakfast go to so I quickly placed a phone order to pick up.  I unfortunately did not have a tasty experience or maybe my expectations were to high.  The pancakes were terrible in fact I pulled out my son's frozen french toast sticks to have for breakfast rather than the pancakes I had just ordered.  The potatoes were greasy and unappetizing it was a complete disappointment and I will be making my travel several miles away to pick up from my regular breakfast place rather than this very convenient location which saddens me."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here, food was great, well priced, and good service! Loved the eggs benedict."}
{"text":"Some of the best breakfast food I have ever eaten! Their skillets are the best. And I love the red velvet pancakes!!"}
{"text":"The service was great. The food is always exceptional. The fresh strawberries on French toast is spectacular. The griddle plates are always a good bet. Waffles are better then the pancakes and the pancakes are wonderful.  I like how they do breakfast mostly and do it very well. I could eat here daily. Fresh squeezed juice who does that anymore. So GOOD.  Glad to see that merged their other location. Now 2 locations for stacks and yolks. Good eats for sure"}
{"text":"Absolutely nothing special about this place. Seemed like everything they do is made from box, can, or frozen. I can get that at chain restaurants. I go to local places to find fresh and unique items. Not here though."}
{"text":"Love this place. They offer great breakfast and excellent pancakes. The pancakes are the size of a plate, with all types of great toppings. The griddle breakfast of vegetables,  potates, eggs and cheese was delicoous. The prices are moderate, the atmosphere is friendly. It's a small resturant but the staff is very accommodating.  I would recommend this place to anyone, I know I plan on going back again."}
{"text":"Always a pleasant experience. The food is great my favorite is the Velvet Pan cake! The servers and the owner are always attentive. This is one of my favorite breakfast place in the city."}
{"text":"RATING:  A - SERVICE: A AMBIANCE: B +  OVERVIEW: Classic American breakfast spot. Food was decent. Service was rapid and efficient. Ordered a build your own omelette which wasn't too greasy and/or hefty. Also ordered some red velvet pancakes. Weren't out of this world put the presentation was what won me over. The food came out at a fairly quick pace. Will definitely return if I could get up before close time."}
{"text":"The griddle is awesome! egg whites = legit. its also nice they added smoothies from the Banana Shack on their menu. They always try new things which is refreshing, especially when it comes to Breakfast! Try It!"}
{"text":"First time I went there and the service was great! We didn't wait long for our food either. I got the lumber jack and the red velvet pancake! The pancakes were Huge!! And really moist. The prices are very reasonable too!"}
{"text":"If you enjoy breakfast joints like those in the mid-west or east coast, definitely go to Griddle Cakes. Fast service, cozy feel, and clean environment. It reminds me of a unique hole-in-the-wall and I'm so happy Vegas finally has a legitimate one."}
{"text":"I was in the area and looking for a place to get some pancakes (or waffles) other than IHOP.  I stumbled upon this place when driving around and decided to try it. I was with my brother and we ordered a pancake combo and a waffle combo. The pancakes were quite large and tasty The waffle was a normal size, but quite tasty as well. The eggs and bacon/sausage weren't anything special, but the prices were decent and the meal was filling.  I'll eat here again (and try their more unique dishes)."}
{"text":"Loved it since it opened!  Great Gluten Free pancakes!"}
{"text":"chicken waffles was good  I mean really good you don't even need syrup service was good that attitude great no problems will go back good prices"}
{"text":"After reading reviews we decided to try this place for brunch.  First waitress we saw tried to take our order as soon as we sat down.  We asked for more time to look at the menu as it was our first time there, but then didn't see her again for over 10 minutes. Another gentlemen ended up taking our order as I think he noticed us just sitting there.  I had a skillet and the wife had pancakes.  My skillet was just ok.  Nothing remarkable from other breakfast joints in town.  The wife did enjoy her blue Jay pancakes.  I wouldn't go back just for the skillet, but if you want pancakes I think those were the better call. Nothing wrong with this place just nothing spectacular like we read in other' reviews so really can't give it more than an average score."}
{"text":"Had some breakfast after shopping and like usual the lemon-blueberry griddlecakes hit the spot. Coffee is always good,  staff is awesome and our waitress Marissa always takes good care of us."}
{"text":"Excellent service & the quality of the food is also amazing. The staff was very attentive and you can tell they're happy to be at work. Definitely taking friends and family here for breakfast when they come to visit!"}
{"text":"The meat lovers was good I would recommend this place for breakfast. Price are good  big portions."}
{"text":"The Griddle is a GREAT little Family restaurant with AMAZING good food & great customer service whether they're slammed or have 1/2 their tables available."}
{"text":"My 10 year old and I went for. Breakfast only 4 tables in the restaurant very slow both our meals came out warm it would not melt the butter on the pancake.  I had ordered a half order of the biscuits and gravy which were par at best.  When the bill came out I was charged for a full order when I confronted the waiter he told me that was not what you told me, so instead of adjusting the he told me he would pay the difference, I'm thinking WOW management must be brutal on these kids.  Bad overall experience not sure if we will be back."}
{"text":"The food was average, at best. Portions were large (THREE eggs benedict, really?). Staff was friendly but forgot to bring my side of bacon, not a good thing."}
{"text":"Great little gem! The place is busy and for good reason. The food is delicious and portions are football player sized.  Don't let the line scare you put your name on the list and wait a few minutes they get you in quickly.  The owner was there smiling and talking care of customers, a lost art these days."}
{"text":"It was very packed for breakfast and not a really big restaurant. I preferred to sit outside but every table was taken. The food is good but the service was a little slow. It was extremely loud and too noisy.  Not really the way I'd like to enjoy my breakfast. I couldn't wait to leave because of that reason but I'll return again and hopefully sit outside."}
{"text":"Amazing pancakes! Amazing price (~25 for 2) The coffee is excellent, the scramble was top notch. The venue feels very private, every table is its own oasis. Large windows let in plenty of sunlight and the service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Wanted to try some place new for breakfast. Our friends ordered chicken and waffles and a tuna sandwich. The chicken and waffles left a lot to be desired. It was one fried boneless chicken breast piece. Other places in town give you two pieces to four pieces of fried chicken for close to the same price. Our friend didn't love the flavor of the chicken or the waffle. Their tuna sandwich was flavorful. We also ordered a Lumberjack combo that has eggs, bacon, potatoes, and pancakes. We upgraded pancakes to lemon blueberry batter. The eggs, bacon, and potatoes were nothing fancy. We expected more when comparing it to some of our other regular breakfast spots. The lemon blueberry pancakes were good and I had not had that flavor anywhere else. There was also only one server and they could defiantly use at least two people working to better manage guests needs. It took a while to get ketchup, syrup, and toast for our orders. I doubt we will be back. I would only come for strictly pancakes."}
{"text":"I've past Griddlecakes for a long time now, and I'm glad I finally stopped in for breakfast.  The menu seemed a little limited, it's about the same price as Egg Works - and much better.  I had the Meat Lover's Scramble and loved it.  It's worth a try!  I'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!  It's a small area off the strip but the trip is well worth it. We were greeted by a very individual who quickly seated us. I have never seen a person work as hard as this guy does. He greets, cleans and serves. He needs to bottle that energy, he'd make a fortune.  The person taking our order was very fast and thorough.  He placed the order quickly with the cooks and it was served with perfection. The food was delicious as well. I ordered a skillet breakfast as did my daughter. My wife ordered a Benedict. We couldn't stop raving about how good the food was, how friendly and efficient the service, and how enjoyable the entire experience. Even though they were short staffed due to the recent shooting tragedy, they managed to exceed our expectations.   Very glad we found this place and will definitely return. Try it, you'll love it as well.  To the owner, you have a great staff, don't let them get away!!"}
{"text":"Worst breakfast I've had in Vegas out of the 7 years I've lived here. Pancakes were extremely dense and looked nothing like the images advertised on the website. Add on eggs tasted like they came out of a carton and were over cooked. Way over priced for the add on egg and sausage. One egg and one piece of sausage. I will never go back to this place and will not recommend this to my worst enemy."}
{"text":"Velvet pancakes... The best... Service was excellent... Recommend to anyone looking for good food"}
{"text":"Outside service was slow, the bill wasn't added right, and they were out of bananas for my pancakes.  Probably won't be back, but it may have just been a bad time."}
{"text":"Just came here for the first time with my boyfriend. Service was very friendly, and food was amazing! We got the eggs Benedict and Arizona skillet with a chocolate chip pancake on the side. Everything was very very good. Defiantly try this place!"}
{"text":"I'm giving a 1 star, walked up put my name on the list,  no one waiting above me, the guy walks out says Donn party of 1?  I say yes, he grunts and walks back in the restaurant.   More people come up after me, he is friendly and gives them a time wait estimate.   Another party of of walks up, he gives her a hug and says come right in, we'll find you a spot right now.  Lesson learned from Griddle Cakes,  if you are a party of one or not a relation or a regular,  your money and your business doesn't mean jack squat to them. Don't even waste your time.   I definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"Let's just say I would never recommend this place.  It takes a lot for me to get up and walk out of a place after ordering, but everything that could be wrong with a restaurant experience is exactly what we experienced at this place. And we never did get to the food.  After 40 minutes with only beverage service, it was not worth torturing ourselves to wait.  So we went next door to chronic tacos and had a great crane asada burrito in no time at all.   Skip this place and save yourself the frustration."}
{"text":"Always good service and food.  Our family likes going there for breakfast.  Service is always fast and prompt."}
{"text":"Breakfast was just ok.  My pancakes were dry, and my wife's breakfast sandwich was screwed up.  It was supposed to have cheese not mayo and turkey not turkey sausage.   The food took too long to come out.   It was our servers first day, so I can understand the slow service, but the food was just Eh."}
{"text":"Went in yesterday, had never been before. Was very pleasantly surprised. So many menu options and the food was delicious! Great service the waitress was very personable she took great care of me. Food was out in a timely manner and tasted great! I had the protein oatmeal pancake with bananas and cinnamon. Was fantastic! Going to bring my kiddos here soon!"}
{"text":"Food is good, but service has deteriorated. We waited more than 30 minutes for food today that was brought out in separate rounds, and the waitress didn't so much as apologize for the wait or the inconvenience of food for two of us growing cold while we waited for food for our third party. And a $40 bill to boot. Probably won't be returning."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite breakfast joints in Las Vegas. The staff is amazing and the food is great! Try their coffee...it's the best coffee in town :)"}
{"text":"Cute little breakfast/lunch spot. We only waited for about 10 mins for a table. I got the breakfast burrito w/ sausage instead of ham it's was nothing special. I checked in at yelp so I got a free pancake but decided to upgrade it for $1 for a lemon blueberry pancake (prolly my most favorite dish here) and my bf got the meat lover scramble w/ biscuit and gravy it was a lot and he liked it. Over all it ok experience it was like wow that was really good. Food wAs ok, waiter was friendly. It's a small place so make sure not to be seated by the door coz you'll be getting whiff of that hot air coming in. Prolly come back for the pancakes again."}
{"text":"If I wasn't focused on the gluten free breakfast I might have given them a higher rating.    I was drawn to this place by their gluten free menu.  Most places that offer gluten free have a limited menu and Griddlecakes was no exception.  But they did have their signature GF griddlecakes on the menu, so of course that's what I ordered.  I thought I needed something to round out my breakfast so I ordered a couple of sausages and eggs as well.  That really wasn't necessary because the griddlecakes were huge and there were two of them.  Loaded up with butter and syrup, they were all - or more than all - a normal person should eat.  And like a lot of GF flour based fare they were heavier than their wheat-flour counterparts.  Sadly, the griddlecakes had a floury under taste.  I would recommend a talk to the staff about how it could be corrected before ordering them again.   On the other hand my wife had a country fried steak with gravy she rated as very good.  And she absolutely loved the pan fried scrambled eggs,, which looked more like scrambled eggs from home than the battered eggs you get most places.  She is also our coffee connoisseur and said the coffee was bitter, but if it wasn't for different tastes there wouldn't be 100 flavors in the supermarket.    The staff was very friendly and helpful.  They kept coming back to check on us and kept our coffee cups full as well. The setting was fresh and different.  It was sort of 1950's made modern.  Hard to describe, but real nice.  The place is small, but luckily wasn't busy when we got there and we had no trouble getting a table right away."}
{"text":"The Griddle stays busy and there's a reason for that...it's good! Over the summer this became a bit of a ritual for my boyfriend and I. We became Griddle experts.   The skillets here are huge and tasty but arrive starving! My favorite is the philly cheese one, yum. I usually stick to the canadian bacon and eggs, simple but great every time. The boyfriend swears the biscuits and gravy are the best he's ever had, so take his word for it. The french toast is picture perfect too.  The coffee isn't quite strong enough for my taste, but that's just me.  A cool part about coming here on Sundays is the farmers market is right in the same parking lot, makes for a great morning meal then a walk around. Sometimes the wait is about 15-20 mins but even on a busy day I don't think I've waited longer than that. They offer outdoor seating as well if you want to bring your canine companion along."}
{"text":"I was the first person when they opened up at 7am and was seated almost immediately. Waiter was super sweet and attentive when I needed refills. Food was delicious and fresh (had the french toast) with just the right amount of cinnamon and sugar. All in all a great first impression!"}
{"text":"The service is pleasant and efficient, but the food didn't match expectations. The restaurant is bright and clean, but the chairs are quite uncomfortable and rigid. It is not a relaxing environment. Breakfast was not memorable. The food was adequate and executed like someone following the steps of a recipe. This review is written like my experience: generic and uneventful."}
{"text":"Great restaurant, nice service. Get something on the skillet. I'll be going there again in the mornings although when I went there it was with family. My order was very customized and they managed to get it all accurate."}
{"text":"Food was so good and the staff was great! Wish we had a Griddlecakes in Hawaii! Can't wait for our next visit!"}
{"text":"I really like the food here but their service is terrible... me and my boyfriend come here in hopes that each time things would be different but nothing. The server never comes to check on our drinks to see if we need a refill..."}
{"text":"It's a shame that all the SERVERS ARE ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE at Griddlecakes on Jones because the food is wonderful. This restaurant is only a minute or two away from my house, and my boyfriend and I really enjoy going out for breakfast. We have been to Griddlecakes about 6 times, and every time we say we will never go back because the SERVERS ARE ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE, but we always ended up going back because the food is so good. Today broke the camels back. We will NEVER return due to the inattentive servers. Today, we were sat by a host/server helper and she gave us our drinks. Then we sat at our table for 15 minutes before we walked out because nobody ever came to take our order. There were 3 servers and a server helper and only 6 tables in the entire restaurant... NOT busy at all. We left, very unhappy and hungry and will never return. HIRE NEW SERVERS! A week and a half ago I came in for breakfast alone. I was greeted quickly and received my delicious food quickly. My server NEVER returned to my table after taking my order (another server brought my food). I like to take my time while eating so I sat and ate for at least 35-45 minutes and NOBODY EVER CHECKED ON ME. Nobody ever asked if I needed any extra condiments or if my food was good or anything at all. My server brought me my check after I finished my food and that was the first I had seen of her since she took my order. HORRIBLE SERVER!! This server has long brown/red straight hair (she's the prettiest one there). The time before this, my boyfriend and I ate our delicious food and went to pay. He paid and then when we walked out, he realized that there was NO WAY our breakfast for 2 should cost $45. This time our server was the pregnant girl. She added our ticket up wrong and overcharged us by almost $20. At first, I thought she just made an honest mistake because she is the only nice and decent server there. Then I checked the menu prices and realized that EVERY TIME we had the pregnant server, she was overcharging us and we never noticed. I guess she takes the extra money that she is illegally overcharging for tips? DISHONEST! I hope the manager reads this post and realizes that she is stealing money from their restaurant. The other server, blonde, that always wears her hair in a bun is EXTREMELY UNFRIENDLY! She is the one who I see there the most, and seems to have been there the longest, or knows how things work at that restaurant the most. She always bosses around the pregnant girl. She would always provide decent service but is not nice, at all. Someone with such a horrible personality should NOT be a server. Never a \"Hi, how are you?\" or anything, always only \"are you ready to order?\" I hate that I will never be going back because the fresh squeezed orange juice and food is fantastic but I have never seen SO MANY HORRIBLE SERVERS IN ONE RESTAURANT. Hire new servers. Seriously."}
{"text":"Ordered pancakes & sausage for breakfast. Pancakes looked delish, sausage was half cooked. Sent them back to kitchen to finish cooking . Ate 1 of 2 huge pancakes. Tasted ok, nothing special; had terrible gassy stomach all day & \"the runs\"! Was sick until 11 pm & couldn't stay out of bathroom. Husband ordered bacon & eggs; bacon was half cooked too; sent it back to kitchen to finish cooking.  His tummy was ok.  If you go, stay away from the pancakes & stick with the eggs!"}
{"text":"Place was \"ok\" food was good i have to say that. But it echos like crazy in there. A large lunch party was there when we were and it was loooouudddd and almost ruined lunch. Service was decent but dont go out of the way for anyone. May of may not be back."}
{"text":"ok place I feel for what you get its a little pricey orange juice it's good but for sure its not fresh squeeze it has like a very weird sweet good flavor but I am sure it's not squeeze I don't think I'll be back"}
{"text":"Great food for breakfast with large portions!! Not much seating but we can usually get a table with a short wait. I love the small, intimate quarters, perfect for breakfast with my husband. The waffles are delicious, the pancakes huge. Great selections and combinations of menu choices.  Love this place."}
{"text":"The food is good at this place when cooked right but the lack of service brings this restaurant down to only 3 stars. It almost seems as management doesn't care and that's too bad because it's a good place to eat."}
{"text":"Wow, this was better than expected! I've gotten weary with all the new breakfast joints popping up all over town. Griddlecakes seemed to have a great menu, so we gave it a shot. The service was great, the restaurant wasn't crazy packed (the tables had a reasonable amount of space between them too) and the food was good. My boyfriend got a scramble and I had the Blue Jay pancakes. So good. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Semi-rotten/brown avocado sent to the table. House potatoes barely cooked...just tasted blanched and seasoned. Low quality steak used for the country fried steak - mostly chewy sinew. Roux in the gravy wasn't cooked out - just tasted like flour. Very poorly executed cooking of simple breakfast food. Total disappointment and will not ever return. Also felt like the air conditioning wasn't working properly."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out because my sister said she heard good things about it.   I walked in and was greeted right away and seated. Was asked if I wanted anything to drink and they brought me my water 2seconds after.  Service was very friendly and the place looked really clean. Now when it came to the food, my Red velvet cakes were disgusting, and I'm not exaggerating. I put more syrup to see if it would drown the sour flavor and I drank coffee after each bite but it didn't get better, I ordered 2 and I honestly could not finish 1. I'm not a picky eater either. I took my second pancake home to see if maybe someone at home would think different but nope, my sister spit it out and my cousin ended up throwing it away. I'm not giving this review less stars because my friends food was delicious (grilled cheese) and I'm thinking maybe my pancakes were a bad batch or they don't know how to make red velvet pancakes. Anyways I think I would come back just never ordering those pancakes again!"}
{"text":"I expected more from this place but found it to be just ok. The service was kinda long and the food was...so-so. For the price, we expected more. The Lumberjack platter was comparable to a Denny's Slam platter...not saying that its bad, but pricey for what you can get elsewhere."}
{"text":"We were so excited to try this place out for the 1st time due to all the great reviews! Well, it was a disappointment   I ordered the chicken & waffle it was so dry & had no seasoning. My husband ordered the oatmeal pancakes w/bananas & strawberries he said it was average & that Dennys had a better pancake batter.  The service was great for being busy as they were. I just wished the food was better."}
{"text":"The food is good but overpriced. Orange juice was fresh but the coffee was not. All of the highchairs have broken buckles which the wait staff was not the least bit concerned with. The soda machine was broken. I had the eggs Benedict. It wasn't bad but nothing special. Same with my husband's omelette. Pancakes are awesome though. If you want good food that is overpriced in a busted down Wendy's then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"This is probably my new favorite breakfast spot in town!!!! We had the Churro Waffle (To die for!!!!) & built our own omelettes. The service was incredible!!!! Sadie and Leah took great care of us and made sure we were good on everything at all times. These girls made our breakfast experience so much better and exceeded our expectations!!!! Make sure to ask for them when you come in!!!"}
{"text":"The best Skillet I've had ever prolly! so fresh hot and fast! everyone is friendly and has a family atmosphere where EVERYONE is welcome!"}
{"text":"I give the service grade A. I ordered the Eggs Benedict and the hollandaise sauce had a little bit of a powdery grit and my home fries were undercooked.   The people sitting next to me thought their home fries were undercooked too. And then I heard another table stating that their crab Benedict was a little too salty.  Staff is very friendly, but I wish the food was good."}
{"text":"Yummy red velvet pancakes. I've been looking and craving for these pancakes for such a long time. A good place to go for breakfast & lunch. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Very disappointed!  This place used to be my favorite place to eat breakfast. I mean in Las Vegas you could get a breakfast anywhere for $3.99.  However, I didn't mind paying $18 for breakfast but today it was GREASY, the coffee is strong and in little cups,  and the toast was not toasted and full of melted butter,  it was DISGUSTING!  Very disappointed with the food quality and it WAS EXTREMELY OVERPRICED!"}
{"text":"Awesome Off the Strip breakfast. Great selections, quality and portions. Super attentive and friendly staff."}
{"text":"This place was very mediocre and I will never return here for breakfast.   My girlfriend chose this place because we wanted to start off her birthday with a new breakfast place to try. I totally wish we would have gone somewhere else.   We get there and the place was very crowded and awkwardly set up. Not the crowded were you are excited about how good the food must be because there are a lot of people, but crowded in the way where it was miserable to stand awkwardly at the door until someone sat you and the chaotic mess of seating people made the process really unpleasant.   When we sat down, we asked for a booth but the person told us that we would have to re-put our name on the list and wait again. We already waited for 30 min. We didn't want to wait again. So we sat uncomfortably at a table that was too small and way too close to the other tables for comfort. I could honestly smell the mans B.O next to me.   The food was nothing special and pretty bland. I got a skillet and pancakes and my girlfriend got a Greek plate. Our food was almost hard to finish because it was just large portions of bad food.   The people made us feel uncomfortable because they made remarks about how we ordered too much food and essentially started calling us fat. I felt really uncomfortable.   What a waste of a birthday breakfast. No thanks."}
{"text":"An amazing mom and pop establishment with an attentive staff. The service is unparallel to the traditional breakfast establishments, such as IHOP and Denny's. I was constantly being attended to, and taken care of. It was an inviting experience.   I went there on a Saturday morning, and it was not too busy. There was no wait time, and open seating available. When I sat down I saw the menu and the food selection was extremely appealing, especially all the types of pancakes. Making my decision on what to choose was difficult. I decided to go with the Country Combo, and was pleasantly surprised by what I was given. The portion size was extremely generous. The home fries were great, and the gravy biscuit topped with a sausage biscuit had me wanting seconds. Overall, the meal was very satisfying.   It is an establishment I look forward on going too often and supporting, and would highly recommend it to those looking for a comfortable breakfast experience in a warm welcoming environment."}
{"text":"This was an exceptional meal. The wait was a bit long for the food but other that everything was amazing. I had the philly skillet and it was perfect although it would be extra yummy. Also had their French toast and it was super delicious. All over a great place with good prices!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and awesome service.  The menu reads kind of like basic diner fare, but it's much better.  We had the eggs Benedict florentine and The Lumberjack and we couldn't finish but we really tried because it was so good.  Even the homefries are delicious.  The service was amazing, very friendly and eager to make sure we had what we wanted.  Plenty of parking with a bunch of other shops.  Low-stress to get to by car.  Highly, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My first experience here was a winner. Can't wait to return with the wife. I ordered fried chicken and waffle. The chicken was flattened, almost like chicken parm style, and had a breading perfectly suited to the side of buffalo hot sauce they provided when I asked (tasted like Frank's, as it should!). The waffle formula was excellent. A co-worker had the El Jefe and devoured the whole plate quickly, and another co-worker had a medium burger with jack cheese and mushrooms and was super happy. They split the check without any issue, and we all walked out stuffed and satisfied. This will have to become a regular part of our lunch rotation. You can sit inside or outside. There are a lot of great restaurants at this location, so if you are coming for lunch you might want to get here a little early to be sure you can find parking."}
{"text":"This is definitely my new favorite spot.  It's clean, the menu has a fair selection since you can create your own omelet and there are several pancakes to choose from.  The coffee is also delicious.  I stick to the same menu items, so I can't say too much about this place because I order the same thing and I don't eat a lot of foods loaded with sauces.  Compared to other breakfast spots, I do think Griddlecakes rates higher than most because of the food quality, cleanliness and service.  It's not a five star because I think they could do a little better in the food preparation, but really, they are a good spot worth visiting."}
{"text":"We visited the Jones/Cheyenne location.  I ordered the eggs benedict and my yolks were very hard and the english muffin was soggy. My \"fresh\" fruit appeared to have been defrosted.  We ordered an orange juice, and it looked like an orange drink - definitely not 100% juice (for $3.50, it should have been fresh-squeezed).  To top it off, a roach crawled across the wall, so my appetite was completely lost. We were credited for one of the meals, but we won't be back."}
{"text":"First time coming here and I think I'm coming back again whenever I'm in Vegas. Its a little out the way from the strip but it's definitely worth it. The pancakes are delicious and come in different flavors and styles but they still have original buttermilk pancakes that taste heavenly.. I'm definitely coming back again to try the rest of the menu items."}
{"text":"This food is as good as breakfast can ever be made! But whats even better is Hamed's glowing smile, super sexy! Everyone working was super friendly, and the food was literally mouth watering. The food always comes out fresh 'n hot, and the coffee always tastes fresh as can be, what else could someone possibly want? Thanks Hamed, I'll be seeing you soon next time I'm in LV."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat. Every meal at anytime of day is amazing, the service is always very fast and the staff are always smiling and so attentive."}
{"text":"Good service and very accommodating. Nice egg white omelet and the skillet potatoes are soft but crispy on the bottom. My friend had the pancakes and although I don't usually eat pancakes they were pretty tasty. It was a little breezy so I sat inside but glad to find a spot that has some outdoor seating.  I'll be back to try some lunch and sit on the patio next time."}
{"text":"This place is really great loved my breakfast!!!!  service was great ask for Tonio!!!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome service, amazing food. I will definitely be back! i had the blueberry lemon pancakes, add bananas. egg was perfectly cooked and the sausage was nice and juicy!  this place definitely has my vote!"}
{"text":"I order via post mates however this review is completely for Griddle cakes. My first time ordering and I'm it sure if I'll order again.I ordered the Philly skillet, which I was excited about.  However all I got was scrambled eggs with shredded steak and cheese. Completely disappointed. I'm pregnant and hungry and wanted my potatoes!"}
{"text":"Hello new breakfast place!!! Sad we haven't found this place before! Staff is great! Food is amazing!! Hubby has the philly skillet and I had the Nevadan skillet... both completely yummy!!! Clean and fun place. We will be back often!"}
{"text":"The Skillets and Chili-Style Burger (Melt) are delicious.  My boyfriend loves the Western Skillet.  The Chili-Style Burger is my personal favorite; although I had a regular cheeseburger today with grilled onions and it was delicious as well.  You can tell the food is fresh and made as you order.  Everything tastes homemade!  This is a go-to brunch spot for the Henderson area (I have friends that go every week) and worth a 15 minute drive for me.  However, it is a small restaurant so try to go early or late to miss the rush."}
{"text":"Good food my wife like that so she likes it pretty good what are the eggs were good pancakes outstanding come back"}
{"text":"Oatmeal protein pancakes were awesome! We also shared the gobbler skillet (turkey sausage, cheese, spinach, bell pepper) and it came with a side of biscuits and gravy. Everything was soo good and their turkey sausage was great, not dry like I've had in the past. we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Been coming here since we moved to Henderson almost 1 year. The service is always fast and excellent. The food is delicious not complaints at all. Stop by you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Everyone was so friendly & the manager even came over to make sure we were happy.  My friend & I couldn't say a word while we ate, it was so good!  I rarely order biscuits n gravy, but it's offered as a side so why not!  Totally worth it & added turkey sausage today which made it a meal.  A small order is big enough & only like $4.    Ambience nice, clean, simple & bright.  I like sitting in a booth looking out of the window lol new to actually posting anything on Yelp so adding more details.    8.13.16 Meekaj was our wonderful server again today.  She is great.  I got the Meat & Eggs, Turkey Sausage, super fluffy eggs!  Next time I have to remember to tell them to fry the potatoes longer, no big deal cause I like them crispy.  Jeff C. got a super yummy build your own omelette w/ all of the meats & cheddar.  He said it was perfection & not overwhelmed w/ cheese, the perfect ratios.  Once again I can't wait until next time!"}
{"text":"Biscuits and gravy were good, along with the fresh squeezed OJ. Not impressed with the red velvet pancake."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch. The place is larger than I thought. It has a very nice open interior. It was very clean. The server came right over and she was lovely friend and I asked her for recommendations and she was very upfront and honest. I always appreciate that.  I went with the special, which was beef tips with eggs, home fries and biscuits and gravy. It was great.  I work across the street, so I will be back. It was nice too because we were in and out within my lunch hour."}
{"text":"So happy to have found another great breakfast spot! It is also so tough to find good gluten free menus. The gluten free waffles tasted great! I would highly recommend! Our friends got the birthday pancakes. They were huge and delicious. The restaurant is quite small though and seems to be very busy on the weekends!"}
{"text":"Huge portions of food that is extremely affordable. The staff is extremely friendly. This is definitely a local favorite. I had the build your own omelette which was excellent!  The spinach was savory, cheese was rich and the mushrooms were hearty and big!  I've also had the blueberry lemon pancakes before here and it was delish!  If you're on a budget and want good home cooked breakfast, this is a good place to go."}
{"text":"The ownership here is fantastic - they offer a great service and really good coffee too. Had a long discussion with the Franchise Owner about it :)  I had their griddlecake and it was very fluffy and delicious, as well as the potatoes, eggs, and bacon. All tasted fresh and were cooked well. My wife loved it too.  I recommend coming here for breakfast."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, some of the best I've had in the area. I love that you can customize your pancakes, it makes for a fun breakfast experience. Lovely service, I like that they offer outdoor seating. Just a great place."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place, while looking for a different breakfast cafe. The service was wonderful, and food was pretty good. I tried their promotional item- Smoked Applewood Bacon Pancakes, which were OK. The pancakes are huge, next time I'll only get one instead of two. My only complaints were the hot water for tea wasn't hot, and our party's food wasn't brought out together. We received our pancakes, French toast first and our eggs and bacon arrived about 5 mins afterwards"}
{"text":"I come here every time I have friends or family visiting from out of town... which is all the time! It is definitely a place you want to check out. A small yet comforting environment with good music and service, it's never too too busy and the food is awesome!! Go!"}
{"text":"What a great place! We went for the first time a couple of days ago since we were in the mood for breakfast. My son had the french toast and loved it. I had bacon and eggs and delicous home fried potatos!   The food was great, the service friendly and professional, the prices are right! We will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place is still open. I'm too scared to see what their health ratings have been. I'm positive I won't be back and I LOVE hole in the wall places.   Servers were friendly. Slow as molasses but friendly. Coffee was not warm. Water tasted like dirt and the cups and glasses I'm sure had been used for 10 years. They were severely stained.   The dining area itself was an odd mix of new items from Ikea and old falling apart chairs and weird wicker hanging lights. The kitchen area as I was paying grossed me out. Had I seen this first we wouldn't have eaten there.   I had biscuits and gravy a half portion. Cold at best. Biscuit was good. Gravy was good. A little salty but I like that.   The eggs were cooked on the outside but inside was VERY runny. I asked for scrambled. It came out like a unfinished omelet. The bacon. Wow. Not. Cooked. Like straight from the wrapper to the plate. No lie.   The bathroom was ridiculous and I'll skip those details. Overall bill was like $16 but not worth it at all. Won't back here. Good luck if you go!"}
{"text":"First time here...waitress was nice. Not wait and lots of empty tables so we figured it must be the food.  Yup! It needs a little love in cooking...chief in the back is lazy! It was kinda bland...should throw in more grease and wait for it to be more crispy , which it lacks. So yeh nothing stands out . Hope they survive...onto another breakfast stand ......"}
{"text":"The peanut butter pancakes were the bomb. The live had the oatmeal pancakes and she like them very much also. Forget doing the combo the eggs and bacon were just plain. Potatoes are nicely well done and crispy just the way I like them."}
{"text":"Met a friend here Sunday AM at 7AM.  We sat outside and had great food and wonderful service.  My friend had the lemon and blueberry pancakes and really enjoyed.  I had the traditional Eggs Benedict.  I could not have asked for it to be any better.    The staff was attentive, yet not intrusive.  We were done and just chatting, and even though they were developing a wait list they did nothing to make us feel rushed.  As soon as we realized we did go though.    I was afraid it would be too crowded on a weekend..but I would not hesitate to go back.  YUM!"}
{"text":"I have a sensitivity to gluten and tried their gluten free griddle cakes and ended up getting sick. Besides that the rest of the food is great and they have good portion sizes."}
{"text":"It may be a little thing but I asked our server three times for lemon for my water but she just kept forgetting. Finally asked another server and she brought it out right away. I don't know if it was just because we had a large group with kids or what not, I don't see why I had to ask four times with two different servers.  Overall the food was decent but the French fries were extremely delicious and I definitely recommend those."}
{"text":"Been here very regularly and that's with good reason. The food is very good (and consistent, which is huge for me), the staff is very friendly, efficient and accommodating.  We've never had lunch, only breakfast.   As for the food, as a family we are constantly tasting from each other's plates. It doesn't matter what I've sampled, it's been very good. The skillet breakfasts, the breakfast burritos, the oatmeal, fresh fruit, pancakes, waffles, home potatoes - all very tasty and cooked properly. My favorite cup of coffee, too.   The place is small and if you get there too late for breakfast, there may be a wait. But I really enjoy the cozy, small feel of the place.   I don't think you can go wrong with Griddlecakes. We haven't in 40+ visits."}
{"text":"Such a friendly group!!! Big portions, kept my coffee cup filled. Had trouble deciding what to order so we will have to keep going back. Free Wi-Fi, which is a must for us while traveling. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant this morning and were very disappointed. The service was horrible (they never brought my decaf coffee, never checked on us and never refilled anything without us having to wave them down). As for the food, it was just average. As breakfast lovers, we were looking forward to trying out a new place. Unfortunately, we won't be going back."}
{"text":"Best pancake I ever had. Had the corned beef hash and eggs. Everything was on point from the sourdough toast to the potatoes delicious,"}
{"text":"The eggs Benedict are some of the best in town.  There is never a wait, fast service, fresh squeezed OJ. Red Velvet Pancakes are ok but it's hard to top Babystacks. Otherwise for a breakfast place this is a great spot that we always default to if there is a line somewhere else."}
{"text":"Chose this place based on Yelp reviews and for it's in close proximity to where I live. Located near Einstein Bagel/Brew Tea Bar.  Came in on a weekend afternoon, and the wait time was 15 minutes. My party was put at on outside table which was fine for the day since it was perfect weather. Inside seating would have been a longer wait, I assume.   Right when we were sat down, the waitress wanted to take our drink order. I didn't have a chance to see the menu, so I just got water.  Another waiter came back in a good amount of time for us to review the menu and order. I ordered the country skillet, and the other two people in my party ordered the chorizo skillet. I also wanted to check in on Yelp for the free buttermilk pancake.   Now here's what really annoyed me as a customer. I checked in and showed the waiter that I was checking in and I asked him if that was okay, but he wanted to actually see my screen showing that I checked in, which was fine. However after a pretty long wait for him to come back, my phone was dying and another waitress came by to ask if we needed refills on our drink. I asked her about the check in and she said I was all good to go. Our original waiter comes back and asks me if I checked in and wanted to see my phone again, and I already closed out of the app. Told him the waitress said it was cool and he just kinda stumbled off. Maybe he was busy in the back or something but he seemed irritated at the whole thing, short, and I never saw him as our waiter again lol.  Food came out in a timely manner, and it was good! I didn't really have any complaints other than some of the food items seemed like it was just warm, not hot. But it wasn't bad food.  Reason why I deducted one more spot is because they didn't tell us refills weren't free. Ended up spending around $12 on Orange Juice ($4/cup) thinking it could be refilled free of charge. This should be more clear next time, especially if the waiter is asking if you want a refill, it kind of implies that there would be no charge?  Good spot to try out, but wouldn't come back or go out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"What a wonderful place to eat! My dad had steak and eggs and I had biscuits and gravy with sausage links! When I got there, a handsome young man opened the door for me, and when he asked me if I wanted a table, I replied that I was here for a pick up, he then called me by name and said my order was almost ready. Very polite! Great food, looking forward to going back and dining in next time.!!!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast place ever.  It was absolutely amazing. Best breakfast spot in Vegas.   Friendly staff you might have to wait but it's well worth the wait.   They are fast at getting your food to you.   TRY THE PANCAKES!"}
{"text":"Food looked good and service was friendly, however tasted very mediocre and lacked seasoning. Left off some ingredients in my omelette (it was build-your-own, pay per ingredient type of item). Orange juice was fresh squeezed with pulp and yummy (waiter told us there would be pulp when we ordered). Waffle was like a college-dorm flavor (flavorless). Kids meals were enjoyed by my 3 young kids and the price for those were great ($5.99)"}
{"text":"Love the service...I don't know if it's Vegas or just this place but everyone is so nice!! Had the eggs benediction and it was perfect!! And their buttermilk pancake so fluffy!"}
{"text":"Stumbled across the place on the way home from some errands. Conveniently located around the block from my house. Got the Rebel eggs Benedict and it was delicious!! Glad I found this place and I will be back to try more of the menu"}
{"text":"This place is just down the street from my home. I've been here with my daughter a few times and brunch with a friends and have experienced very good service. Each time the place was busy and still the food and  service was on point.  The last five times I've been there I went with my husband. Two out of the five times we were there we had good service. The other three times we had issues due to a waitress.   There is one particular waitress, dont know her name. The only way I can describe her is the girl with the piercing in the middle if her Clavicle bone. Let's call her Clavi.  Clavi wasn't outwardly rude but she was definitely being weird and kinda fake nice. My experience with her while there with my daughter and my friends in the past have always been warm and friendly. But something changed when I started going there with my husband.   1st visit with my husband our order never made it to the kitchen. I had to get up and ask the guy ,who I believed was either Mgt or the owner about our order. It had been over 35 mins and Clavi never came back to our table to check on us or to see if we needed more coffee etc. My husband and I usually discuss weeks events during brunch and didnt realize we were waiting that long. When we did, we realized that two small groups of people came in after we placed our orders and they got their food. Mgt apologized and we got our food about 5 mins later.   2nd and 3rd time we were there we had a different waitress and the service was great. Busy days...and we got our food within a reasonable time.  The 4th time Clavi was our waitress and we waited and saw a large group put in there order after us and got their food which doesn't make sense. We didn't order anything special and we had to wait about 25 mins to get our food. I had to wave to her her attention that time.   5th time I was there with my husband and daughter and we ended up being served by Clavi and she was weirdly loud with us while taking our order. Weird and annoying! Also it happen again, no food but this time it was over 20 mins....others were seated and eating. Also Clavi addressed every table in our area but ours asking if they needed anything.  I decided I'm going to ask about our food so that we are not sitting there for over 20 mins again. This time no mgt in site but Clavi made her way over to the register to address me and pointed out that our food was there...yeah it was there sitting and waiting for someone to bring it to us. She just chose not to do it In a timely manner apparently.  When she brought the food she seemed annoyed and talked to us with a louder tone asked if we needed anything else then left and came back once and refilled my daughters water. Ignored my empty water cup or my husband's coffee cup. Never bothered to grab my cup or my husband's cup also never bothered to bring us out check..we sat their took our time and couldn't get anyone's attention to get more water. At this time they were not that busy.   I was never rude to this woman or anyone at the restaurant not even when we had to ask for our food. Don't know what her issue was until my husband pointed out that she seem to have an issue with us. We are an interracial couple and he says he'd seen that look before. (FYI my husband is white. I am not) I'm not used to being treated that way so I thought I'd write this so that maybe Mgt can address this and other customers do not get treated this way. I don't know what her deal is but we do like the food and the other staff members seem to be genuinely nice. We might be back but will make a point to not sit in her section."}
{"text":"Not only do they have great food, the customer service matches their food. So my daughter picked this place for her birthday lunch(20 years old today!!) because she wanted breakfast. We got there and was immediately greeted and seated when we arrived. Since this was our first time there my daughter didn't know what she wanted and the server came back a few times to check on us to see if we were ready. One thing that really stuck out to me was when we were ready and she was saying what she did and didn't like the Server told her tell me what you want and we will do that. she wanted the pancake with sausage but no egg. Sometime in the conversation I called her birthday girl and when our food was brought out, the server also gave her a birthday waffle and wished her happy birthday. That blew us away, there are not many places these days that would do something like that to make someone feel special. The place was nice and clean and the staff was attentive and friendly. Now on to the food, both of our skillets were the best we have had in Vegas my one critique was on the philly one a little more meat. Other than that they were cooked to perfection with just the right seasoning. My daughter loved the waffle most of all, she said it was nice and fluffy and the strawberry syrup that was drizzled on it made it so good. She liked the pancake with the strawberries(she liked the strawberries were sweet and she didn't have to use a lot of syrup and sausage was good. She liked the birthday waffle the best, said it made her day. Thank you Griddle cakes for the good food and making a birthday girls day a little extra special!"}
{"text":"Griddlecakes is a great place to stop for breakfast after church. We eat here often. Good food and great service makes for a nice dining experience. You get 10% off if you review it."}
{"text":"My teenage daughter is addicted to the red velvet pancakes!  We have been to Griddlecakes five times in the last month.  Each time we have had excellent food, and excellent service.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Took my brother here for breakfast one morning. The place was moderately busy, self-seating, clean tables and chairs. The service was timely and friendly. The wait staff was informative with the food choices, as to what went in it and what substitutes they offered. We sat outside, the area was clean and quiet. Some customers had their dogs with them, some read newspapers, and some were enjoying the day outside. We ordered from the breakfast menu, and the portion was adequate for the amount we paid for. They didn't try to rush us out, and overall my brother and I thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. We have breakfast here now once a week and we recommend this venue."}
{"text":"Very good breakfast food. Got the eggs and bacon. The eggs are pretty good, the potatoes are awesome. They are seasoned really well. The bacon is good and soft. I ordered a pancake too, and it was very good. I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Very Nice Waiter. Excellent Food. Efficient. Cooked Properly. Nice View. Quaint Diner Atmosphere. Pleasant."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic food w/ amazing seasoning. Had a skillet and tasted flavors never experienced at other restaurants. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast!  Five of us came in for a late breakfast!  Meat lovers scrambled was plenty of food for two and my son did his best but had to bring some home.  The turkey sausage skillet was excellent and potatoes awesome.  The biscuits and gravy were super too!!  We will be back and truly enjoyed our meal."}
{"text":"We stopped in here on a rainy Saturday morning and were the only customers the whole time - Im assuming people did not want to go out to eat due to the rain because I had heard a lot of people raving about this place. Our server was very on top of it (although we were the only customers :)) I ordered my usual boring two egg breakfast with chicken sausage. No complaints - everything really good and my coffee cup was always full!"}
{"text":"I stopped In after dropping my sister in law cats off at the groomer and I loved everything about it! Reminded me of a lot of small businesses back home! Everything was quick and delicious! The workers there were very nice and friendly and props for the one waitress being able to be able to take on so many tables like that! I'm guessing the owner was there and was going around and checking on everyone as well! I'm definitely gonna be returning!"}
{"text":"Came to Vegas for a family emergency and grabed some breakfast near the hospital when we arrived it was pretty empty- it's small but super cute inside. The service was great. The food was average, but super affordable- our bill came up to $23, not bad at all!"}
{"text":"This place was good the first time I went like 6 months ago I went there today and it was a disaster. I ordered a BLT my bacon was a stale and looked green my fries were not hot at all it was like my food had been sitting around for 20 min. My friend got breakfast the sausage tasted like plastic the bread was crumbly and the eggs looked like the processed eggs from McDonalds. I am not one to complain at all but after eating a part of the BLT my stomach is killing me. They need a new chef they took my order off but with the disappointment of the food still had to pay 10dollars will never go back again."}
{"text":"I joined a friend and my parents here for breakfast on my birthday.  We had dined here before as it is walking distance from my parents' house.  We will not be going back.   Our whole experience was dreadful.  Several items we ordered were not available - at 10am on a Sunday, they were out of French toast.   We waited more than 30 minutes for our food to arrive.  We had a small child who ordered a fruit cup, and yet that took over 30 minutes too.  I got up to refill my own water cup.  I got up again to ask for a refill of coffee for my dad.   We complained.  We asked to speak to the manager.   They did little to remedy our experience, stating only that it was a new cook and the line was backed up.   There were a number of empty tables.   It was clear to us that they were not staffed appropriately.   We were in the restaurant over an hour and a half.   Not exactly the way I wanted to start my birthday!"}
{"text":"My wife and I always pass by this place and so today was the day we finally stopped by and gave it a shot! First thing we noticed is how clean and neat the joint was. We were immediately greeted at the door. At the entrance there is also a chalkboard showing their specials for the day.   Our waiter came and took our drink orders. YOU MUST GET THE ORANGE JUICE!!! There are many places that claim that they have fresh squeezed oj but this orange juice here is the real deal!!!   For our food orders, I went with the Philly skillet, and my wife ordered the birthday pancake. My skillet was really delicious, 3 eggs made to order over a bed of nicely seasoned home potatoes (I say nicely seasoned, because they weren't too salt like other places). The pieces of steak were very tender, overall I really have nothing negative to say about the delicious skillet.   The birthday pancake looks and tastes exactly like what you think it would. Funfetti batter, strawberries and raspberry drizzled on top with whip cream on top. I was thinking this pancake would be a bit too sweet but it was surprisingly not. The pancakes are big, no measly baby flap jacks here!   I'm glad that my wife and I gave this place business because we will be coming back.   Quick review.  Service is fast and tentative  Food portions are good for the price  Orange juice is really hand squeezed  The potatoes aren't rolled in msg and salt"}
{"text":"I have passed this restaurant many times and decided to give it a try today. You don't feel like you are in Las Vegas when you step into this restaurant. If you come from a small town then you will know what I mean. The service was good and the food was delivered in a timely manner. The portions were big and the prices are very good. I ordered the red velvet pancakes. They were extremely good. They tasted just like a red velvet cake. I will definitely be going back again real soon!"}
{"text":"This place was on point. Good food in large portions, good service, clean restaurant... I'd come back. My g/f got a red velvet pancake that she loved and a biscuit w/ gravy. I got a meat lover's skillet which came with a biscuit & gravy.  The portions were huge, so we both got to-go containers. The prices were reasonable, and everything came out quickly and well cooked, even on Saturday morning. I have no idea why this place gets low reviews!"}
{"text":"Arrived at about 8am. Practically had the restaurant to ourselves. Very clean and friendly environment. Ordered the Monkey Business griddlecake with a side of eggs and sausage, the Razzle Dazzle griddlecake, and a patty melt (because it's never too early to have a party melt). Everything we ordered was cooked to perfection. Our waiter was friendly and kept our glasses full. Will come back again."}
{"text":"Used to go to Rambo's Kitchen,  the restaurant that occupied the space that GriddleCakes is in now.  GriddleCakes was a far better experience. Great friendly upbeat waitstaff with fast well plated and delicious food.  Great breakfast joint."}
{"text":"I've been here twice so far and both were great experiences.  The food is delicious.  I had the lemon blueberry pancakes and a side of bacon.  You can custom make your pancakes by adding different flavors to them.  The service has been very good both times."}
{"text":"If you like BUGS in your food, then this is your place to go!  No, seriously. I used to be a devoted Griddle fan.. This was my go-to for a breakfast spot..  Until I had two NASTY accidents here within a week of each other!   I had visited this place with my sister. She ordered a chicken salad sandwich of some sorts. When her order came, she lifted a slice of the bread to add salt and pepper, and what do you know, a BUG was crawling in her sandwich. We immediately sent it back, and noticed a few diners looked a little turned off from their food.. So my sister agreed to just order the same thing. They \"made\" her a new one, which came out suspiciously fast, for \"making\" a new sandwich?  Now for the second round. I decided to go here again later on in the week on my lunch hour with a coworker. I ordered my usual egg white omelette with potatoes. As I am slicing my potatoes, there is very CLEARLY a DEAD FRIED FLY IN MY POTATOES.   This place is disgusting. I will not be back. Sorry, Griddle, but take better care of your sanitation. NASTY."}
{"text":"Cheese was bad and had a funny smell. I had taken 3 bites of the food when I noticed the sour taste. Had our waitress take the food back and the female owner still charged me because I ate some of it. After arguing with her about the fact I didn't eat the meal the male owner started taking pictures of us and followed us outside to our car and continued to take pictures of our license plate and harassing us in the parking lot. Worst customer service I have ever had."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot off the strip! Awesome pancakes and eggs!"}
{"text":"The pancakes are the bomb! Everyone is super friendly and service is good. Definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"I will start saying that I am fan of Griddle Cakes, The Griddle or whatever their name is on their other locations. When I saw that they had a location on jones and Cheyenne I was pretty darn excited. My husband and I went and the food was pleasant, not the best, not even close to their other establishments, just descent. I took my parents to eat last weekend and I can say I was extremely disappointed. The food was good only if you added a ton of salt, pepper, hot sauce and if you  imagined that you were somewhere else. My eggs were so gross I couldn't keep eating them, the sausages were sooo flavorless and nasty, the potatoes were just plain and nasty. What really bothered me was that they brought the pancakes for my dad and they were wayyy undercooked, we mentioned it to the waiter, she took them back and brought the same pancakes a lil bit more cooked. They were chewy and flavorless. Extremely disappointed. I do know that the other griddle cakes are owned by the Children of the owner of this establishment on jones. How about letting them take over?!?!  I was excited for griddle cakes to open there but it's only the name pasted on top of the older place called KOuntry Kafe. Customer service is good, but I can't eat the customer service ;). Customer service did earn them an extra star."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday morning cause we needed to stay in the neighborhood. Was greeted and told to choose anywhere to sit. Took us a minute to see what we wanted and my fiancé found out if she checks in on yelp you can get a pancake for free which is nice. So I asked if I can do two and was advised we couldn't. Now some places let you do more than 1 but I'm not going to complain about it. I order a meat mix with scrambled eggs and my fiance ordered sausage and eggs. Food came out quick. Pancake was good soft and fluffy. Her breakfast was good. However mine was not as good. Mine came with biscuits and gravy and the biscuits was dry and the gravy was bland. Other wise everything was good for a breakfast place."}
{"text":"Stopped in for Sunday breakfast. Place was busy enough but thought they need to get some kind of noise cancelling artwork or something on the walls as it seemed extremely loud in the venue. I don't care to eat & have to cover my ears part of the time, yell at my dinning partner or ask them repeatedly to repeat themselves since I couldn't hear them. Now on to the food. I ordered the lumber jack plate which included 2 pancakes, 3 eggs, 3 sausage (or bacon) & fried potatoes. It was just OK. I'd have to say the pancakes were OK but I have had better pancakes at other venues. I didn't care for the sausage. It was extremely hard to cut as the casing seemed very tough. I'd much rather have sausage patties than links. I didn't really care for the potatoes. They were a little tough as they weren't cooked enough. I do have the say the glass of fresh squeezed orange juice was awesome. Service was great but unfortunately that's not enough for me to come back to the place. I like a few other breakfast places much better."}
{"text":"Breakfast was A-OK but what I remember the most is the sound the dishes made as hit the bus station that was right behind my head."}
{"text":"Love this place, have been here four times already.  Good portions for your dollar, tastes a lot fresher and less greasy than ihop.  Service is good, coffee is great, food is fresh"}
{"text":"Absolutely some of the worst food and service I have experienced in quite some time.  No flavor in the food.  I ordered the Arizona skillet that was served over \"home friends.\"  My friend ordered the Patty Melt.  40 minutes later my skillet arrived.  It was a chopped up hamburger, eggs, and green peppers served over boiled potatoes on a skillet.  My friend's Patty Melt was a small hamburger with 2 slices of American cheese served in Rye toast.  I ended up asking the waitress to take it off of my check and sent back my uneaten breakfast.  Her response was, \"so you're not going to pay for this?\"  When my friend went to pay for his food, we saw the kitchen.  There was so much food sitting out in the \"danger zone,\" a grill that was nasty dirty and two cooks that completely looked lost.  The health department should really come in and shut this place down.  Do NOT go there!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a great find! The food was really good and tasted great! The service was excellent very attentive service. I would highly recommend this place for breakfast. I had a skillet with sausage eggs and potatoes and also the biscuits and gravy. Flavor was excellent. The place is small so there may be a little bit of a wait but it's worth it."}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoyed our breakfast here. The food was good nothing outstanding about the pancake and eggs. I will say the customer service was outstanding. Thats why 4 instead of 3. And I will return to try other menu items."}
{"text":"First time here. It's a small place, but worth the wait. Fortunately, we didn't have to wait long. The service is fast and friendly, with generous portions. The food is well prepared and delicious. Definitely the best breakfast place in the area."}
{"text":"Just happened to stumble upon this place and I have to say I am glad I did! Food was great and service was fast! I highly recommend Griddle Cakes if you want a great breakfast."}
{"text":"Great food! No complaints. There were three of us and we all ordered different items (2 from lunch side of the menu and one from breakfast) and we were all very happy with everything."}
{"text":"We live down the street from Griddlecakes and always wanted to try it. It was a very HOT summer day. Today was 110 degrees and we walk in around 11a and it was extremely hot in the restaurant with only swamp coolers around, mind you I'm 9 months pregnant and it was hot and uncomfortable. I got a Nevadan skillet and added Portuguese sausage. I was so excited to try it and it came out fairly quick. I took a bite into it and it really didn't have any flavor. The only flavor I got from it all was the Portuguese sausage. I thought it would be a little bit better...probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Great Food, Super Great Service, and very reasonably priced!! The kids had the Smores and the Birthday Cake pancakes and they loved them.  I had the chorizo scramble and it was awesome. We will be back!"}
{"text":"The place is cute and nicely decorated. The waitress was very nice and informative. Unfortunately, the food was not that great. No seasoning what so ever. Pancakes were okay, average.  personally, I've had better."}
{"text":"I spent my first time here last Saturday when some friends came in from out of town. I showed up last in my party of 8, and figured we'd have to wait a while since there was 8 people in our party. Thankfully, by the time we had all said our hellos, they were ready to seat us after just a few minutes.   Having never eaten here before, and frankly, not much of a breakfast person, I decided to play it save with french toast and a side of bacon. The wait staff came through quickly and grabbed our orders, and brought us out drinks. By the time we had gotten our first round of drinks, our food started to arrive. I saw many different plates at our table since we all pretty much got something different, and as they were placed each looked better than the last.   When I finally got mine, I was presented with a full stack of over-sized french toast that looked like it belonged on pinterest or something. I seriously had to hesitate starting to eat it because it looked that good. After I finally regained my senses and picked up some silverware, I began to enjoy what is easily the best french toast I've ever had. I dug into my ginormous plate with full speed, and managed to make it halfway through the last piece before I finally had to stop myself. Somewhere in the brief pauses of the french toast, I took time to polish off the full plate of bacon which can only be described as moments of bliss.  The staff was top notch, and several members of the team came by our tables helping each other out while we were there. The drink refills came by without provocation, and out of 8 people in my group amidst a completely full restaurant, I only saw them ask what someone was drinking once. Very attentive staff with a great attention to detail. If only this place was 15 miles or so closer to my house, I'd be here at least once a week, it's that good."}
{"text":"Sorry fellow yelpers... This place didn't cut it for me.  We stopped in for breakfast.  I read other reviews and people really loved it!   She came to get out drink orders and left menus for us to look at.  My husbands menu had milk all over the inside of it.  So tip #1... Wipe down your menus.  Tip #2... Wipe down your tables also.    Had finished my coffee and had to wait for our meals to be delivered to get my second cup.  Hmmm.  No problem because my food was in front of me now.  I ordered the Crab Cake Eggs Benedict.  It came with a side of potatoes.  The Benedict was good! Had a unique flavor and the hollandaise didn't overpower.  The potatoes however... Wah Wah.  They were so disappointing that I didn't have more than two small bites.  They were too mushy with not enough crisp on the outside.  Bummer.    Now for the real let down.  My husband ordered the country fried steak.  He was actually enjoying it until...   A HAIR was found in it.  That completely ruined our appetites and breakfast was over.  So tip #3... Wear hair nets in the kitchen please.    I will say that our waitress was very friendly and courteous.  We didnt say anything about the hair to her.  We were just ready to leave.    I don't see us coming back anytime soon.  Real bummer."}
{"text":"Great food amazing staff.Hamed and nick really know how to give great service will be back again!"}
{"text":"Thought we'd take a chance on The Griddle. Unfortunately, it was the wrong call. Biscuits in cold gravy.  Bland food.  Strangely, the water had a terrible taste, so we couldn't even wash the food away.  The pancakes at least seemed OK at first, but then..  the weird taste of the water and the food stayed with me for hours, I just couldn't get it out of my mouth.  It's 7 hours later and I can still taste the weird flavor.  I really don't think I'll be going back there."}
{"text":"I had the Big Nevadan. It was flavorful, meaty, cheesy,potato goodness. The buttermilk pancake was delicious. I can't wait to try the other pancake flavors (lemon blueberry specifically). Great little place. I'll be returning soon!"}
{"text":"Service was good but the food was gross. I ordered the western skillet with scrambled eggs and biscuit and gravy, husband got the chicken fried steak with fried eggs. The coffee tasted burnt, the gravy on my biscuit tasted like the canned stuff from the grocery store, scrambled eggs tasted like they were powdered to begin with, and my husbands chicken fried steak was tiny (like the size of a hamburger), flat and looked like it started out frozen and they just warmed it up. I'm sorry but they need to step it up on the quality of the food they serve, at least of what we had."}
{"text":"Amazing!  We ate here last week and I forgot to post a review.  Dicing of course and the die's choice, I had been here before but my friend had not.  She had to order Pecan banana pancakes and she didnt think she would like them but they were good!  I had to order the lemon blueberry pancakes and they were also awesome.  The place is small and we did have to wait about 5 mins for a booth but its worth the wait.   Clean, comfortable, good service.  No complaints."}
{"text":"Wow! I don't even know where to begin on how bad our experience was just now.. I ordered the BLT sandwich and asked for my bacon well done I get my food the sandwich has no mayonnaise on it and my bacon was barely cooked.. not to mention our server not once came over and asked how are food was or to even check on any of the tables sitting.. we have been here many times before and never had such a terrible experience I can't believe I spent $9.00 on a sandwich that I didn't even eat.."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places for breakfast.  Yes, it is a small place and gets crowded and you sometimes have to wait to be seated but I haven't found the problems that others have found.  However, I'll be on the look out for bugs because I'm thoroughly grossed out!  The fresh squeezed orange juice is really good and my husband always orders the breakfast burrito, which he swears is the best.  My order varies and I've never been disappointed.  Our daughter always gets the children's pancake plate and loves it.  They have really good pancakes and these are just the plain style.  I'm picky about pancakes and hate IHOP!  We've  brought friends here when they're in town and they loved the place as well."}
{"text":"OK once again my Yelpers did not disappoint! Griddlecakes is quite tasty. The waffles were perfectly cooked to a golden flaky finish and in a shape that you can easily pull apart and dunk in syrup...kids can share with ease. The syrup is good too! The wings had a good flavor with that perfect crunch. Oh the pancakes are HUGE... One is enough for an adult or split a stack. FRESH squeezed OJ... My poor kid was confused on the pulp and seeds...city kid!  It was great tummy feeling good enjoy!"}
{"text":"Mmmm...The Griddle Platter: chicken, spinach, mushroom and feta on top of potatoes. served with eggs and pita :O)  I've never had a problem with the service here and absolutely love their Griddle Platter! I cannot wait 'til I spend 2 months in Henderson on my clinical rotation to get my fill of The Griddle!  On a side note: I tried my friend's red velvet pancakes (which I found out about through yelp) but, didn't find them anything to brag about. Maybe the hype on yelp killed it, but nevertheless, still good food :O)"}
{"text":"We were in the area for a softball game and found this place on yelp. Definitely a good pick! Loved the griddle skillet, lots of food, want to try all those pancake options. A few of us did order the smores, Arnold and bir th day cake, all good! The best part was thier biscuit and gravy!!! Best ever!!! Moist and fluffy biscuit with yummy gravy!! This place is worth trying!"}
{"text":"Today my daughter took me to this cute little restaurant for breakfast. I had seen it a few weeks ago and was excited to give it a try. We got there and only had a 20 minute wait before we were seated. They too my drink order and a few minutes later took our breakfast order. The home fries looked pale and undercooked so we mentioned this to our waiter who suggested we request well done, so we did. As we waited for our meal, I heard the gentleman beside me attempting to order and the waiter, our same waiter offered him home fries or hash browns. I wasn't even aware they had hash browns. My daughter ordered Iced tea and an empty bowl to put the sugar packets trash in. We waited 45 minutes for our food to arrive.  As the waitress is delivering our breakfast, she also takes the trash bowl. Someone comes by and refills the tea and my daughter ask for another empty bowl. Our short stack of pancakes arrive about 10 minutes later. The waitress brought a trash bowl that still had trash in it and just sets it on the table. Now I'm no germaphobe but I have to wonder is this our original trash bowl, she took ours about 10 minutes ago, why is it wet, and isn't it restaurant policy to deliver clean dishes to a table once they've taken a dirty one? It was nauseating and I had had enough. I will not be back and I can not recommend this establishment to anyone."}
{"text":"Best breakfast joint in town! Hands down! The quality of food, service, and location are all great. If you haven't been here before I highly recommend you come check out griddlecakes on eastern!"}
{"text":"Great customer service. Bacon was so good. Perfectly made. Pancakes were good but not the best I had. A little dry. Still, I will be back."}
{"text":"The decor is simple and homey, but I came looking for breakfast. Not atmosphere. Service was great. No complaints there. I had trouble deciding on what to order. In the end, I went as healthy yet fulfilling as i could. I ordered the Monterrey Griddle Skillet. Home Fries (that Do NOT come with the traditional peppers an onions, which is what I like anyway), tender chicken pieces, diced tomatoes, sautéed mushrooms, topped with feta cheese and 3 eggs. Also came with Biscuits and Gravy. Skillet was more then I could hope for! The feta made the while dish! Hats off to the creators of this one. Biscuits and Gravy was decent. Better then most but I'm still looking for more flavor, so the search continues for that.   Overall great experience!"}
{"text":"I've had breakfast at Griddlecakes a handful of times since I moved to Vegas, and so far so good! Importantly for me, they have outdoor seating with waiter service - which means dog friendly!  My husband and I always try to order different dishes and then share. So for instance, on one of our most recent visits he ordered eggs benedict and I ordered the red velvet pancakes. You should know, the pancakes are huge!!! I ordered the short stack (2 pancakes) because I thought one wouldn't be enough for us to share - I was so wrong!! We had at least a whole pancake left over and took it home to eat it for dessert later. The red velvet pancake was definitely good - but I actually think I prefer their waffles. And although I'm not a big eggs benedict fan, I thought they were pretty good and my husband really liked them. This actually might be one of his favorite breakfast spots in town - and we'd be here a lot more often if I didn't insist that we try new places!"}
{"text":"Couldn't even finish my lunch, maybe this place is great for breakfast but it's terrible for lunch.  The waitress was very friendly and gave us a discount but the food was just bad, bland and a little gross."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this breakfast place for years and their service is always great and food is very good as well. Pancakes are the best!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very relaxing here at Griddlecakes. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. They also have tasty Gluten Free options and are happy to help accommodate me with my food sensitivities. I will be back here again."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good and the service was really attentive. Almost as if they were over compensating for some bad reviews haha, I'm not going to complain. They asked how we were doing a lot.   I got the lumberjack breakfast and clearly I wasn't a true lumberjack because I couldn't finish the pancakes. The pancakes were huge and pretty decent, pancakes just are not that exciting to begin with, I just had a craving.  My friends got the skillet things those were pretty good.  I really liked their home style hash browns? potatoes? It was something like that, they were chunks of potatoes with a nice crispiness to it.   The best and most dangerous item we ordered was the churro waffle. We split the waffle for the table, it tasted like the best churro you've ever had mashed mashed into a waffle. Taste so good but probably going to give you diabetes if you finished the whole thing by yourself."}
{"text":"Just ate my entire plate of lemon blueberry pancakes with added strawberries and bananas. So amazing!! Service stellar!!! Awesome complete menu. Can't wait to return and try Everything!!"}
{"text":"My grandpa swears this is the best breakfast place in all of Las Vegas. I agree that it's good, but it didn't knock my socks off. The first visit I had some egg and potato meal, the second visit I tried a veggie scramble. Both were tasty and a good size for one person.  The service was pretty fast, which is great if you're in a hurry for a sit down meal. However, I missed having a few smiles thrown into the service. The coffee mugs had some coffee stains on the outside and that also was a bit off.  There are a lot of seats for small groups. We went during prime brunch time and got a seat right away. In the morning, the shade covers the out doorseating, leaving it nice and cool."}
{"text":"Everything we ate here has big portions and the prices are really reasonable. The staff is always friendly and go the extra mile. This is a perfect spot for breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"Place is amazing. Big portions. Service is very pleasant.  Very inexpensive!  Fresh squeezed oj. Come before 11am if you want to get some.  Very worth coming. Very homey feeling, love it here."}
{"text":"Pretty standard breakfast joint serving up some large portions. I have visited twice so far, having tried the philly skillet and a stack of chocolate peanutbutter protein pancakes. Both meals were on point and left me very full and satisfied. I would recommend this place to those craving pancakes or enjoy hearty breakfast skillets.  Pros: large portions, good selection of pancake batters and toppings, skillets come with a side of biscuits and gravy Cons: unseasoned poatoes in skillet, premade biscuits used for biscuits and gravy. Both were fine but could have been so much better."}
{"text":"Tried this place early on Father's day. There was no wait, we were greeted in a  friendly manner & seated quickly. It was kempt & clean, which gave me an idea (hopefully) of how the kitchen would be. Simple menu.. Gluten-free options- pretty cool. I ordered the \"Griddle Platter\". The food was presented beautifully. It was also very... \"clean\". Nothing was smothered in butter, grease or sauce-- which in my opinion was great. The service was top notch; Ivan made our visit very pleasant."}
{"text":"This place has suuuper good food that's for sure.  But the only downside is the service. i've gone back a couple times and there's never been improvement. even when it wasn't that busy the service was just kind of \"ok.\" they definitely can step it up a notch there..the staff pretty much just seats you, takes your order and then you never see them again until they drop off your check. i even asked for more water when our food arrived and never got it until they brought our check like 20 minutes later."}
{"text":"Good greasy omelets dripping in cheese. The food is good, prices are  average, service normal, atmosphere is cute.   I do recommend this place for food however CAUTION check you bill to see if it is correct.   4 out of the 5 times I have eaten there the bill was added up wrong or I was charged for food I did not receive. I do not think it was done on purpose just some people with poor math skills work here."}
{"text":"Food was decent, pretty average. My Arizona skillet was way better than the burrito but I didn't like the way the ground beef was pretty much a chopped up burger, the buttermilk pancake was good. The service was horrible, we got water right away from someone walking by but no one ever glanced our way for an order. Ten minutes in I got the attention of a lady servicing a table next to me and said excuse me we still haven't been helped. She said oh wow, I don't know where he is, okay and helped us without attitude. We got checked on once we were finished and ready to get the bill. The place is teeny so I probably won't be back with no waiting area but if someone's in the area I wouldn't discourage them from trying their luck!"}
{"text":"Very good food and service. Good portions. always refilling drinks without needing to ask. Great prices the chicken and waffles are great."}
{"text":"Ordered French toast today. It was good but it was soggy. French toast shouldn't be soggy it's because it probably wasn't cooked all the way. I called this order in today to be delivered a few doors down (even though apparently they don't deliver and the lady on the phone said it would be okay), I asked to pay with my card over the phone and they said I would have to come in and pick it up if I was going to pay with my card. I went in to pay with my card and they didn't even check my ID. What was the point of not being able to use my card over the phone if they weren't even going to check my ID? And besides who would place a order that would be delivered to a place of business and use someone else's card without their knowing? I get it but none of that made sense. Customer service in all aspects is key in any type of business and I felt I could have been served a lot better. Not sure if I will go here again even though the food is good."}
{"text":"We love this place, it's our regular breakfast joint and we are here almost every weekend.  The staff is friends and we're on a first name basis with most of them. The food is great and I'm never disappointed when trying new things. Prices are pretty decent too."}
{"text":"This place has bad service. We sat outside for 15 minutes before we got our menus and then didn't get service for another 20 minutes to place our order. Once we got our food it was cold and the person that checked up on us was the hostess."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I've been here twice and both times the food surpassed what I was expecting. Nice, shabby chic, pleasant environment. Can't wait until summer to sit outside! Staff is also very friendly!!!"}
{"text":"Costumer service was excellent and we didn't wait long for our food to be serve. No complains with all the food we ordered. The food was great and I'll definitely come back again soon!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love breakfast. This place was good, however I had one major complaint. The BAD: The chicken fried steak was over fried. It was almost black when they brought it to me, just covered in gravy to hide it. Biting into it I found out that it was very tough and chewy.   The GOOD: Biscuits and gravy were very tasty, flaky biscuit and smooth gravy. The eggs were cooked to perfection, we also enjoyed a hummus dip with pita bread. I want to eat here a few more times to give it a full chance. We will be back."}
{"text":"OH EM GEE!!! There is no way I could have finished even HALF of my meal. The (small) portions are HUGE!!! My problem was that even though I was full, I kept picking at my food and nibbling because it tasted so good! The protein pancake was so delicious!"}
{"text":"A nice, clean, convenient location for me although it can be a bit hard to find the first time since it is in the corner of the mall. If you are in the area shopping at Von's, CVS or any of the other stores at Village Center Circle, you might as well drop by here for breakfast or lunch. I usually have an eggwhite omelette and add things like turkey sausage, spinach, fresh cut jalapenos and green or red peppers. The service is friendly and quick and they have a play area for kids. It is a family run operation and one of the owners is almost always around so it shows that they care about their business. Good place to start the day."}
{"text":"Had breakfast with a friend here this morning. She comes here often and recommended it, I've never been before and love breakfast so thought why not. It was a busy Saturday morning, we got a table as soon as we had arrived. We ordered our drinks and had a few minutes to look at the menu. I ordered a pancake and a side of homefries, my friend ordered a waffle combo. By this time there had been 2 or 3 tables sat down around us. It took over 20 minutes to get our food, though people and tables sat after us had all gotten their food. My potatoes were very sad, large and bland chunks that looked boiled and not crispy at all. I only ate my pancake. My friend said that her food was very good despite the wait. Our waitress was nice but the rest of the service wasn't good. Other tables had been completely bussed while we had sugar/creamer containers and straw paper on our table from when we got our drinks. Overall not impressed and if in the area will get breakfast at the never failed Crêpe Expectations."}
{"text":"I have only dined here once and the service was great but I prefer to order through Postmates. The Chorizo Scramble has become a regular favorite of mine that I crave often. It is so good that ever since I tried it, there's a little devil on my shoulder that camps out, always tempting me to order it daily. And with Postmates that can get really expensive. I try my best to be good... *sigh* So yeah, I definitely recommend it but don't blame me if that same devil starts camping out on your shoulder & tempts you too. Can't say I didn't warn you!"}
{"text":"Great little breakfast joint!  Husband raved about his pineapple sausage.  We opted to eat outside since there was a wait for inside (also, it was quite loud inside).  Service was great and food came up quickly.  My pancake was delicious as were my eggs.  OJ was pretty fantastic too - they warned us that it wouldn't be as sweet as oranges are out of season but it was still very tasty."}
{"text":"This is a pretty tasty breakfast / brunch place. Note: They do also have a lunch menu too. The star of the show here, of course, is the pancakes. They also have numerous skillets and other items. I opted for the chocolate raspberry pancakes. I'm not a huge pancake fan, but they were darn tasty (and big too). The other items were just alright. Tasty enough, but not necessarily something I'd bother ordering again. Service was ok. They were quite busy. We also had to wait an unusually long time to receive our order. But the pancakes here (of which there are MANY different options) were quite tasty."}
{"text":"Only came here because we met up with people who wanted to try it...  This place doesn't even deserve the 3 stars it has.   The food is below average at best. It wasn't even that busy n it took forever to bring out 3 simple meals. The servers were clueless at their own place they work."}
{"text":"Arrived at 9:50 am on a Sunday morning.... Seated rather quickly, then waited over an HOUR before our food came. The wait is not worth it, especially when you have kids. Avoid this restaurant on a weekend."}
{"text":"First time here and it is the cutest little restaurant ever. Had a very \"homey\" feel. And my peanut butter Belgium waffle was delicious. Cozy place, delicious waffles, and great service. You can't go wrong here! :)"}
{"text":"Walked in, didn't see anyone. No customers, no staff. Weird. It's a small place, so I saw a waitress when I went in further into the seating area. Got my coffee, which was okay, typical diner coffee. Ordered a garden skillet to go, went to use the bathroom. No paper towels in the gents, and the soap dispenser is about 5 feet up from the floor, on the wall. What if someone in a wheelchair needs soap? Food was decent, I ordered a veggie skillet with a biscuit and gravy. Portion was huge, no disappointment there."}
{"text":"Worth the price, great place for breakfast. I ordered the chicken bacon melt with fries, and it was delicious. Nice server, absolutely coming back."}
{"text":"Love love love the blue jay my husband and i come here all the time after or before dr appointments and we always enjoy our meal and the employees that work there...highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Marisa our waitress was super knowledgeable and the food is always amazing. It is my go to for breakfast. A must if you are wanting somewhere else besides stacks and yokes"}
{"text":"I really WANTED to like Griddlecakes more.. I WANTED it to be a 5 star place. It's basically in my backyard, it's super cute, clean, the service was good, the prices were fair, the portions big, and the freshly squeezed OJ was amazing.  Unfortunately, my food was just ok. I ordered the blueberry lemon pancakes and made it a combo, which came with 2 huge pancakes, eggs, and your choice of meat (I got the sausage links). The eggs were fine, pretty hard to mess up scrambled eggs. The sausage was good too. But the pancakes, the star of the show, were sadly pretty average. I didn't taste any lemon, there was lots of  blueberry compote and blueberry, though. They were big, so I definitely had food leftover, but they just didn't \"wow\" me.   I would return and try some of the other items, they had some good looking omelettes and skillet plates. But for pancakes, perhaps another location. Pity."}
{"text":"There is nothing exceptional about this place. They serve an adequate breakfast, without anything that would ever stand out as different or amazing.  If you prefer your service and meals   as bland, this could be a nice place for you. As a testament to their marginal quality, this is one of the few places that has a short breakfast wait time on a late Sunday morning. I guess that's positive? Eat there once and you'll understand."}
{"text":"Looking for a new favorite breakfast/lunch place? Well this is it!!! I never go anywhere else....I have been coming here for awhile and have never had a bad experience! My food is always served fresh and amazing. Your never going to get a bad meal when you come to Griddlecakes. My mom loves there eggs Benedict she actually craves it! The Hollandaise sauce is never tart and always amazing and we just can't stop coming here!!!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE. Me and my hubby come here every Friday or every Sunday for breakfast. The food is fantastic the staff is so friends and our lady waiter is phenomenal! Highly recommend this place for everyday eating or occasional spoiling"}
{"text":"I love this place! Food is always great and the service is too. It gets quite busy at times so seating is limited."}
{"text":"My favorite place for breakfast. Good food and very nice people. What else could you want !!! Yes"}
{"text":"I have stopped in here numerous times over the last few years.  Some days it is busier than others just like any restaurant but I have never had an issue with putting my name in the list and waiting my turn when necessary. The service has always been prompt but more importantly friendly.  The food is also great from breakfast to lunch with a wide variety of options to choose from.   I will be back for sure anytime I need a good breakfast or lunch with a smile."}
{"text":"One of the best places I've been to for breakfast ever. The pancakes were the bomb along with one of the best breakfast burritos I've had anywhere. Pancakes are ridiculous large and the breakfast burrito very filling and tasty. The service here is great, very quick and the servers very helpful. The ambiance of the restaurant was very nice. Large open windows with a very nice color scheme. A must stop when I am in Vegas for breakfast."}
{"text":"First and foremost it was super cold.. second after we ordered we seen another couple who came in about 10 mins after us get their food before us. We ordered some super simple breakfast items. My potatoes came out cold. Overall I probably won't be coming back here I'll stick to baby stacks.. the waitress Amber I believe with the pretty lashes was super sweet and she deserved our tip not the establishment"}
{"text":"Got food to go here a few times while a family member was in a nearby hospital. All of the employees were very friendly and went above and beyond with the service. The chorizo skillet was awesome and the breakfast sandwich was so good I could eat it every day."}
{"text":"I grew up on the east coast where we have \"diners.\"  The Griddle is like those.  Good food and real, friendly service.  They are open for breakfast and lunch.  I have gone for both.  There are plenty of tables - in my 8-9 visits I have never waited more than 15 seconds to be seated.  I have ordered menu modifications and the servers remained very cheerful and the order came out right each time.  The prices are very fair.  (There is no super cheap option like you might see at Denny's, but the food is much, much better than you'd get at Denny's).  The only thing I can really think of to make the place better is to find a way to make the interior a little more cozy.  It is bright, open and very clean, but it is a little bare bones as far as decor.  I did not visit with small kids, but I saw that they have a play area and toys away from the main part of the dining room."}
{"text":"What a great hidden gem. We were hitting up the balloon festival and are not use to being in this area, found this place on Yelp. Decided to give it a try, this place is very small and jam packed as expected for a Saturday morning . We had to wait about 10 minutes for a table. But the service, food , atmosphere was all 4 stars for us. We were greeted repeatedly from the time we walked in. I had a custom egg,spinach and cheese burrito. Daughter had French toast, husband had the Portuguese Sausage , all of which were delicious. The food was hot!!! So hot I could hardly eat the burrito. Got our boxes and the check fast as well. If we are ever in the area again we will  be eating here again."}
{"text":"My breakfast and my boyfriends was very bland. We got the waffles and the blueberry lemon pancakes. The pancakes didn't even slightly taste like lemon and the waffles were mediocre. Although the presentation was nice, I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"We used to love this place for breakfast, however we haven't been here in about 2 months. The food was still the same but the service SUCKED really bad today. Didn't recognize any of the servers, what got me was we sat there for 10 min & were ignored until I said something. Other patrons came in & were greeted with coffee & they're order taken quickly.......anyhow we got no apology & know we will no longer eat there."}
{"text":"Great food and good service, in small location crowded parking. But the food more thsn makes up for it. Red Velvet Pancakes OMG. The cream cheese topping is fire, Eggs Benedict done right. Owner comes out and greets his guest definitely a place to come when in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Due to the location I think our expectations were a bit high. The prices are a tad much for the quality of food but the service is above average.  It may be a bit better than Denny's but it can cost you about double for the same quality of food. We had the Lumber Jack breakfast and Breakfast Burrito and they were just ok. The pancakes were doughy and under cooked and most of the rest of the stuff resembled food from a high school fund raiser. The French toast and waffles may have been better choices. The OJ is fresh squeezed which is a nice touch. Don't set your expectations too high and you will be happy with the Griddle."}
{"text":"I had the Belgian waffle with eggs and bacon. Nothing special. The service was good. I probably would ho go to ihop instead. At least for the waffles."}
{"text":"After looking at the reviews I was hesitant to try it out, but I'm glad I did ! My experience was great ! The service was amazing and so was the food. All the servers were very friendly and attentive. Our food came out very quick and was delicious. The rev velvet pancakes are so yummy and so are the lemon blueberry ones! They don't taste much like pancakes though, they are very thick almost like a bread or cake. Bacon and eggs were yummy too, and the French toast was delicious! Definitely recommend giving this place a try ;)"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. My family and I have been here atleast 50 times since it's been open. The staff is always friendly, the food is always great and comes out in a timely manner. This is my favorite breakfast/lunch place to eat hands down. #TeamGriddleCakes"}
{"text":"I love this place! My boyfriend and I found a GREAT go-to breakfast spot. They were very accommodating and efficient; that's what I love the most. Prices are awesome and the quality of the food is impeccable. I highly recommend their chicken and waffles :) We also brought our puppy to enjoy breakfast with us. Our waitress was so thoughtful and even brought out a food/water bowl for us. We ate outside and the breeze felt AMAZING!! If you're looking for a place to eat breakfast or early lunch, Griddlecakes is the place to be."}
{"text":"The Red Velvet pancake is the BEST I've ever had!  I've had many pancakes in 43 years.  The staff is VERY friendly, although a little distracted or overwhelmed during busy times.  The food is pretty darn delightful for eggs, skillets, breakfast stuff.  Never done lunch there.  Oh, they just changed their name to Griddlecakes.  You should go."}
{"text":"I really miss the 60s diner Rambos that used to b here but griddlecakes is also great. I've had breakfast here twice and it was perfect both times. My toast came out pre buttered and hot which is a win. Most places bring out cold toast and hand u frozen butter.  Our pretty waitress Mekhe (sorry if spelled wrong) waited on us on both visits. She's super friendly and always right there whenever u need anything. They play modern pop music on the sound system and as a bonus some of the waiters dance a little and sing along... not the girls I'm talking about the guys. Haha My favorite was the huge 6 foot 4 inch server who I caught dancing to Justin Bieber when he thought no one was looking.  So the foods fantastic and the staff is amazing but the best part is this place isn't even close to being as busy as other breakfast places in town. Another win."}
{"text":"We had a really nice time at griddlecakes. We started our breakfast at around 10:00 am Sunday. It wasn't packed but it was full, which is a good sign! We ordered a half portion of biscuits and gravy with sausage to start and it was really good! We also ordered an omelette and eggs and bacon. My eggs were sunny side up, I wish that restaurants would fry the egg to make it crispy! But it's ok! The bill was about $30 for both of us including drinks. It was yummy and good service!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite breakfast spot. When I travel I hit up places all over the country and few measure up. Food is great and staff is friendly. Bonus points for being right around the corner from my house!"}
{"text":"This place reminded me of a nice New York City diner. My nephew and I went in for a quick breakfast before church not knowing it was a sit down type of place. The waiter could see we were in a rush and he took care of us right away!!! I mean A+ service.. the food was !!!! My nephew couldn't stop talking how huge the pancakes were. I love the fact that this place had a family atmosphere.... Seriously I wish I remembered the waiters name... He was short staff and kicked butt!!! I wish I could give him a shout out. You need to try this place!!!"}
{"text":"I like this place.  The people are friendly, the food consistent, and location very convenient.  The prices are about what you expect from a breakfast place (around $8 for a typical egg dish), but be careful - a diet coke adds around $2.50 to that.  Add tax and tip, and you'll be looking at around $13 per person.  To me it's worth it here!"}
{"text":"Not a large menu but everything we tried was good. I'm not sure why they are only open until 3 though. They are missing out on business because we would eat there more often after work."}
{"text":"Pass on this place. Food was ok, nothing special. Service was bad. When you have to continually go to the counter to ask for things it kinda puts a damper on the dining experience.   Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Great service, prompt yummy food we had the eggs Benedict french toast and veggie omelette and all were really good. Potatoes are awesome as well. Will return."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place now! Everyone who works there is extremely helpful, and the food is amazing! The chicken and waffles is too good to pass up. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is a really great place for breakfast or brunch. We went after church around one and the were able to accommodate our large group. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"This is a great place to have breakfast. The food is awesome and the staff and management are exceptional."}
{"text":"They have no WiFi! The servers are relatively friendly but offer you the check every 5 minutes, I would understand if the place was packed but there's 20 tables and maybe 6 other customers in the cafe. I had the Country Breakfast, as soon as it arrived so did the check, I then ordered an OJ with that came a revised copy of my bill.   All in all its a cute little breakfast spot, the food is great and arrived in a timely manner but the customer service is really horrible."}
{"text":"I don't know why people like place. I ate here today to give it another chance, after trying it years ago. I ordered the buttermilk pancakes, two eggs and two bacon. The pancakes were chewy and had to be cut twice thru with a knife, my opinion is that you should only need the side of a fork to cut pancakes. The flavor was extremely lackluster, I'm almost positive they use bisquick  mix in the back... I can do that myself at home for much cheaper.  The bacon was also poor quality, and flavor. You can buy better bacon at Walmart. As for the \"two\" eggs, the portion was very small, and I'm sure was liquid egg. Considering the current egg crisis I can figure this. They were the best tasting thing on my plate.  The staff is polite and helpful, the location is small but clean-up but I will not be coming here again."}
{"text":"Breakfast portion was big but food was just \"ok\" nothing spectacular, atmosphere was the worst part, all booths are connected and in poor shape so when the person behind you moves, you're forced to move with them whether you like it or not. Service was nothing special either, kinda dissapointing"}
{"text":"I love the food here. Must eats are the El Jefe, oatmeal protein pancakes with PB, and the chicken and waffles. The coffee is always fresh and the service always friendly."}
{"text":"Peanut butter pancakes.  Birthday cake pancakes.  So good. A nice local place for some good breakfast.  Support a local business like this instead of IHOP or dennys."}
{"text":"Great food here all the staff is awesome and attentive. All you can drink on the coffee only downside is size on the establishment but the turn around on tables is pretty quick."}
{"text":"This is a nice little breakfast spot right by my office. The food is very good and the service excellent. It's a good thing I am NOT more of a breakfast person or I would eat here far too often and way far too much."}
{"text":"We had a good meal this morning at Griddlecakes.  It hollandaise sauce on the eggs benedict was a little oily as were the sausages but over all it was pretty good. Service was excellent and they aren't shy with the coffee."}
{"text":"Love griddle cakes! Best breakfast! IVAN is great as well! Always takes good care of us:)"}
{"text":"Seemed like a nice little breakfast place when we walked in. People were really nice. Got a menu with milk all over the inside. Ordered the country fried steak with eggs over easy, toast and, home fries I think they called them. The eggs were cooked perfectly, as was the county fried steak. Gravy was nice and thick and very tasty. The potatoes on the other hand were bad. Tasted like boiled potatoes cut in to large chunks, then pan fried for a few seconds to reheat them. I did get a free hair from the cook right in the disgusting potatoes. That's when my meal ended. Too many good breakfast places around to waste my time with this one."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying we have come here many many times. We have watched the service go down, saying to each other this might be the last time we come here. Today we came in a great mood ready to enjoy our day. We were sat pretty quickly greeted by a buss boy who is always nice to us, we both know how to act and how to tip. It took forever for a waiter to take our order and then another 30, yes 30 minutes with us having to ask where our food was before we got our food. We didn't order anything difficult or that needed to be cooked for a little big time. We ordered corned beef hash and eggs for me and eggs and hash browns for my husband. They struggled to get it out of the kitchen when it was served my husband did not have a fork as the table had not been properly set. I got up to get a fork for him..... This is where the smug owner came over and said can I get you anything else. No apology no hey I'm sorry no nothing, nada, zip, zilch. Then our hash browns were raw tasting hard as if they had been rushed so maybe waiter forgot to turn our ticket in, who knows no one cared to explain or apologize. We were handed a ticket at full charge which we paid but my husband did complain that our service was lousy and hard potatoes, where the very smug jerk of an owner smirked and got real smart ass about things and told us to have a nice day. Really!!! We're not people who run a waitress or who are demanding we're not lousy tippers, we're not rude, and wee were treated as though we were the jerks. We will never be back."}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this place. Inside appeared clean & looked good online. I took my fiancé out here for his birthday & it was not satisfying. The service was okay... But the food took FOREVER to come out (40 minutes to be exact)- just for red velvet pancakes & a skillet. The table next to us commented by saying, \"Mmm.. This water sure is good\" as they also waited for their food. The party outside gave back the menus saying that couldn't wait any longer. When the food finally arrived, I couldn't eat the pancake. It was difficult to cut. The skillet had very minimum salt."}
{"text":"Not bad. Small restaurant, looks bigger from the outside. Service was great- has a mom and pop shop feel to it. Food was very good, husband was impressed! This place is down the street from where we live. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Super bad service! After being told to have a seat I waited 5mins  with no one coming by and when they came by it was to say theres a list and I had to leave the table after the busser spilled water on my feet."}
{"text":"Came in on a Monday morning thinking it shouldn't be so busy. It was. However, the staff should learn to acknowledge people walking in. It's very confusing as you walk in and you don't know if you should take a seat or walk to the back counter for service. So I went to the back and asked a male server and he said to just sit where Id like. The only unoccupied table was at the front and had dirty dishes on the table. I told him the table was dirty and he then said that someone would soon be with me. It took 10-15 minutes for anyone to clean it. Horrible customer service. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time going here. The food was just basic. You're better off going to Denny's"}
{"text":"Not a fan... Ordered the corned beef hash. 3 eggs is a plus, but had no salt... Nor did my underdone potatoes. Corned beef was skimpy, with julianed potatoes. Lot of potatoes! If this is made inhouse from scratch, they should taste their food as they cook. Its bland. Waitress was sweet, but never asked how my food was, lol"}
{"text":"The place is so awsome, I took my mother for the first time. She has food limitation (Reno Failure). The owner and servers helped her with her order, they were so considerate and made us feel so welcome, the food was great, we've been there once a week so far...order the French toast with fresh bananas and strawberries!"}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times and each time I was not disappointed! The staff is super friendly and food is always fresh. The menu is very diverse and ranges from wings and wraps to skillets and sandwiches. Their fries are definitely one of my favorite side dishes, along with the biscuit and gravy. I definitely enjoy this place!"}
{"text":"One of the better breakfast places in Vegas.  We go out for breakfast more than any other meal and we usually pick Griddle Cakes.  The manager stopped at our table to make sure everything was perfect.  Which it was.  One of the top breakfast places 'off the strip' in Vegas."}
{"text":"Lunched here on a Yelper recommendation and was glad I did (yay Yelpers!).  I did not come here for breakfast (which seems to inspire widely varied reviews), so I cannot comment on that, but they make a mean lunch.  I got a turkey avocado sammy on a croissant, which was simply delicious.  My dining companion opted for their Philly cheese steak and was happy with his choice.  The cheese steak was served with grilled mushrooms and onion, which he was delighted with.  The side salads were beautiful--crisp and lovely greens, all of it tasting wonderfully fresh.  Oh!  Plus, they serve a great local bottled root beer--I can't remember the brand, but my dining companion is quite the root beer aficionado and was in love with it immediately.   The service was delightful.  The prices were reasonable.  The dining area was very clean with cute, colorful, somewhat eclectic décor.  Plus, upon entrance, the kitchen can be seen quite easily (always a comforting sign).   One thing to note:  They have limited hours.  They're just a breakfast/lunch place (open until 3pm).  Can't comment on breakfast, but definitely a five star lunch!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out yesterday! It was good! Clean restaurant! Great service! Very quiet. Great atmosphere!! I have the chicken fried steak and eggs, super yummy! Food came quickly which was awesome! Will definitely go back again!!"}
{"text":"My first visit. Impressed with the service, food,  and decor. The best bisquits I've had since living in Vegas. Only thing keeping it from 5 stars is the strange red chairs; very uncomfortable. They do have a nice long padded bench as an alternative but, when I was there breakfast there was no room. I will be back though."}
{"text":"Second visit since they opened, both were pleasant. Food was fast and exactly what I ordered. The fresh OJ is a must. I will have to return for lunch and try a burger or something. I wish they had a few outside tables. It's great having a good breakfast lunch place in walking distance."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday  afternoon. Service was nice and prompt, I was a little skeptical because of the reviews but the food here is really good. Their potatoes are bomb and everything I tries was very good. Recommend the strawberry lemonade and monkey business pancakes."}
{"text":"I dropped into Griddlecakes for the 1st time at the suggestion of my breakfast buddy. We went to the location on Cheyenne & Jones & it's very quaint. Some sort of converted former fast food joint. Everyone was very polite & attentive & you could tell that there were regulars, which is always encouraging. But!, my issue came when we quickly realized their roof has TONS of leaks (it was raining)! There were buckets everywhere, tables out of commission for being dripped on & even we were a centimeter away from a steady drip. I was legit worried that the roof was going to just cave in. That can't be safe?... or allowed?... because this was not a surprise to them with one isolated leak that just happened. I truly feel like it's an ongoing issue. The breakfast & coffee weren't out of this world, but it was really good... & it was nice that, at 8:00 in the morning, there wasn't a 45min wait. But the leaks- that really took some of the appeal away!"}
{"text":"Wonderful breakfast spot. Seems to be pretty popular with the locals, but both times we arrived by 9a & sat at a lovely shaded tables outside.   The red velvet pancake is quite delicious & my eggs were cooked perfectly. My husband enjoyed his Arizona Scramble (with over easy eggs instead of scrambled)."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 I would. We went for breakfast before my daughters graduation today. 3 open outside tables. I asked if we could sit outside. He said i had to put my name down. I did and looked at the list. Me and another party listed first avail. Everyone else was waiting for inside. Why then were people waiting at the outside tables? Why were people then seated inside and we are still not called to sit down for outside? A second waitress also just let people sit at the open outside table bc they were waiting for inside. Again...why were we not seated outside as requested?  We left bc we have a graduation to get to and they clearly dont know how to manage their seating or their customers.  Terrible service. Will never go here again."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best or if not the best breakfast diners in Vegas. The service was great as well as the food.   I order the eggs benedict and a two pancakes. The egg was poached perfectly and the hash browns that came with it were delicious too. The pancakes came out soft and fluffy just the way I like them.  I highly recommend this breakfast joint to anyone in the area to go try."}
{"text":"This place is my \"go to\" for breakfast... For sure! I have definately become a regular.  Food is always on point and amazing. Servers, Ivan and Marissa, provide excellent service. Expect to wait , if you are there during busy times. However, the wait is worth it!"}
{"text":"Great food! The menu had lots to choose from and everything looked great. Traditional breakfast, brunch & lunch favorites plus a few specialties. Everything we got was delicious!! Biscuits were light & fluffy, pancakes were perfect and the club sandwich with fries was better than expected. All for a great price too. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. First time coming here from San Francisco and I'll definitely be coming back. I came here on a Sunday morning around 8:30 and wasn't very busy. Food is amazing and service is fast."}
{"text":"Great food and service!! I went there twice this past weekend and loooved it! Highly recommended :)"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in town! From the skillets to the healthy egg whites and chicken breast.  Service is always great. Pancakes are great but I enjoy their french toast more."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since we have been here so wanted to try it again.  Got greeted at the door and seated right away. Waitress was nice and got our drinks to us quickly and took our order.  We got biscuits and gravy with sausage patty on top, side of three eggs and home fries for about $7. Everything was cooked the way we wanted and was good.  Nice mom and pops breakfast spot. Would come again."}
{"text":"Scrumptious food and fantastic service!! Fresh squeezed OJ, lemon blueberry and PB pancakes , and bacon and eggs were delicious!! Can't wait to come back and try more items!!"}
{"text":"One lovely morning, I had a wonderful breakfast on the patio here.  It was about $30 for two OJs, one coffee, an omelet and pancakes.  A little much but the food was wonderful.  I always enjoy when the servers let you linger a little on a Saturday morning after you're done eating so you can sip your coffee and enjoy the day...and they definitely did that here."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Everybody that works here is super nice and always accommodating to your needs. We have a dog & try to bring him anywhere and everywhere so it's a big plus that they allow dogs on their little outdoor seating area (two or three tables). Liz is a such a sweetheart- and our dog, Atlas absolutely loves when she gives him some attention.  Everything my boyfriend & I have tried here has always been good, from the skillets to the delicious pancakes! I wish they had flavored creamers but I'll survive since they have decent coffee. Other than that, we are always satisfied."}
{"text":"STAY AWAY. Had a horrible experience. Went with my family to try something out of the ordinary chain breakfast spots. Put my name down for a party of 5 waiting like twenty minutes outside. As another party of five arrived they sat them right away.  Went to find out what happend and saw that they had scratched us off the list. This place is small you must wait right outside. Customer service is non existent in this establishment. STAY AWAY"}
{"text":"I went here with my two aunts and grandpa after church one Sunday morning for brunch and the weather was perfect enough to sit outside because the inside was super crowded and my grandpa cannot hear very well. Griddlecakes has the best pancakes I have ever had in my life. I even tried out a little of my aunt's lemon blueberry pancake, and that, too, tasted amazing. Best restaurant to go to breakfast or brunch...period."}
{"text":"My daughter and I have been here twice and so far  it's our favorite breakfast place. It's quick, fresh and service is great!"}
{"text":"Great place if you like alot and i mean alot of noise with your breakfast oh and now you can sit outside watching police cruisers hovering because two doors down they opened a med. Marijuana shop. I wont be going back"}
{"text":"Great food, great people, great atmosphere. I live right around the corner and this is my new favorite breakfast spot."}
{"text":"I was here often when it was Kountry Kafe.   Griddle Cakes is mediocre at best.  I asked if they made their own corned beef hash, the answer was st least truthful.  No, it comes from a can.  I ordered bacon and eggs.  My husband asked if the chicken fried steak was fresh, no, it's frozen product.  He ordered bacon and eggs.  They do give generous portions, but the food is extremely bland.  No seasoning was done to the eggs, but the eggs  were cooked properly.  The home fries were chopped up baked potatoes warmed up with a bit of grease, absolutely NO seasoning on them.  My husband's biscuits with gravy (At an additional cost of $1) was some sort of soggy dinner roll, definitely not a biscuit, drowning in a passable country bland gravy.  The service was not attentive at all.  Coffee cups both totally drained before she came to check on us.  Had to ask for water, never offered.  Never checked on us until we were done eating.  In all, a very disappointing experience versus the old owners.  Will not return."}
{"text":"I had 'the arnold' protein oatmeal pancakes with chopped pecans, sliced bananas and cinnamon to top it off.  The hubby had the regular pancakes with scrambled eggs and sausage.  Both dishes looked like impeccable and tasted even better!  The protein pancakes were the best I've ever had, other than what I make at home!  Awesome service!  Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I must say the food is delicious!  The French toast was nice and fluffy!  Awesome service and the food came fast-  THANK YOU!"}
{"text":"Went in today with my boyfriend and mother and we were greeted as soon as we open the door and sat quickly. There wasn't a wait to be served drinks and the server was very nice and sweet. The food man was delicious. Those red velvet pancakes with the raspberry drizzle and cream cheese  so good and the home fries are perfect and so is the egg whites and the turkey sausage. Actually didn't finish our food and we took it to go. Everyone enjoy their food and it is definitely worth the trip. Also the staff are all friendly! Thank you. All so the OJ is so good! The fresh stuff is the best stuff"}
{"text":"I saw a picture of their funfetti pancakes on Instagram. The picture looked so delicious my husband took me out for breakfast the next morning to try the pancakes. My husband got the original pancakes and I ordered the funfetti pancakes. The funfetti pancakes were made with the same batter as the original pancakes but they put sprinkles and whipped cream all over the top. For some reason I was under the impression the batter for the funfetti pancakes would be different. Anyway, the pancakes were still good but I don't think we will be visiting again anytime soon."}
{"text":"Really good comfort food with a homey feel. Great customer service,  we will be going back."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place, in every way. From its tiny homey inside,  the great owners that are so nice and accommodating to the awesome specialty griddle cakes!   Omg they are so good! Smores, Blue just, Arnold, Razzmatazz! Aahhhhh so many so good! Best is the price!   I will continue to go back as much as possible!"}
{"text":"Very nice staff, nice and Clean but the food was just ok. If your looking for real butter, real maple syrup and good coffee this isn't the place. I felt like I ate at an upgraded Denny's... and I never eat at Denny's."}
{"text":"Food is good, service was good and atmosphere is above average. We had the Philly skillet and French toast. Like another reviewer said, the Philly skillet was low in meat (heavy on potatoes). French toast was fine, probably would have been better if I shelled out for  the $2 flavored syrup. Nice place to sit and drink coffee, unfortunately my refill never came."}
{"text":"While I was visiting Vegas my friend suggested this place for breakfast and I have to say everything was excellent! Our server was very attentive and made good suggestions the owner even stopped by and introduced himself ! I ordered the churro French toast and I have no complaints , definitely would stop by again!"}
{"text":"Always great food great service awesome family environment the owners and servers  are aleways friendly and make u feel like family"}
{"text":"We have not been disappointed yet here. Food is always great. A Great place for breakfast. Pict utter es to come..."}
{"text":"loved the food!!! My husband ordered wings and waffles which were really good. I had the griddle cake combo which was very delicious!  The restaurant was clean and the staff very friendly with speedy service. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Good food good peps, service is a little slow on weekends. Also, they have gluten free and awesome specialty pancakes"}
{"text":"Small but cozy breakfast/lunch eatery. Fast and friendly service. The price is reasonable for a good size portion. Lots of restaurants nearby but I will go again for breakfast. Food is delicious."}
{"text":"I'm very disappointed with the quality of freshness.   I ordered the Philly skillet with a side of sourdough toast and as I was eating the toast I noticed a peculiar discoloring on the bread. As I look closer I noticed the discoloration was due to mold. I inspected the other toast and noticed it was on all the pieces.  I kindly told the waitress and she was nice to offer more toast, but I declined knowing the toaster might have been contaminated.  As I receive my check the waitress offered a $10 gift card. I used it towards the check that day and will not be going back again.   (I apologize, I was not able to take a photo.)"}
{"text":"Great cakes, really good home fries and biscuits and gravey. The service was good, the price was very fair and the outdoor seat was clean and comfortable.  My wife order the breakfast sandwich and it was excellent.  We will be back for more"}
{"text":"I am a HUGE breakfast/lunch fan -- and have tried all in my area and this one is just OK for me. We were seated promptly after arriving and greeted by a very nice server. The Red Velvet Pancake was okay and my waffle in its flower-shape was more entertaining to look at than appealing to my tummy. But it was very pretty nonetheless.   My major gripe is that I was charged $1.99 for my child's drink even though we bought a kids meal. That's pretty ridiculous for me. Usually drinks come with the purchase of a children's meal. I am very conscious about pricing for my kids.. and this really annoyed me. And when  mama  ain't happy ... its not good.  I probably won't be back .."}
{"text":"The place was packed this morning! We had great service! I tried the Eggs Benedict Florentine & had one pancake. The eggs were poached correctly and the sauce was flavorful. The side of hash browns were tasty too. The pancake was nice and fluffy and cooked perfectly. The picture on the menu shows one egg on an English muffin, but you really get 2. I couldn't finish my whole breakfast'"}
{"text":"Mediocre food, at best. Even if it was good or the best ever, I'd never come back due to the very loud buzzing that sounds like ringing in your ears due to, what the server said is the ice machine.  I'd get that fixed..."}
{"text":"Average diner fare.  We went here because the Crepe place was too full, and had perfectly good food."}
{"text":"Wandered into this place because it's right by my house. Went in and it was really busy so the only place for me and my 2 year old to sit was a small 2 top table. I'm not one to be picky so I took it. I still don't know who my server was because one person took my drink order, another took my food order, another brought the food, and I had to flag down someone else to get things and a different person brought my check. So I'm still pondering that one... I ordered a short stack, eggs, sausage, biscuits and gravy. The food came out in a timely manner but the girl who brought my food had attitude written all over her. The plates simply weren't going to fit in my tiny table so she kept rearranging things until I finally dumped some of my food into my daughter's plate and handed the girl the extra plate. She took it and walked off like she had better things to do. I had to flag another guy down for syrup and utensils. The only good part of all this was the pancakes. They are delicious! I stuffed myself full until I realized I still had biscuits and gravy which weren't that good. Nothing else tasted too special either.  The rest of the staff were nice, especially one older guy who finally noticed my daughter sitting on her knees after we got our food, and offered a booster seat and fixed the wobble in our tiny table.  I doubt I'll return...which is a shame because I really liked those pancakes.  As a restaurant manager I firmly believe service is EVERYTHING. Get it together guys, it'll make a world of difference :)"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and my final verdict is...it's A-ok.  It's a cute little cafe located in the same plaza as Einstein bagel, Taco Y Taco, Popped Popcorn. So, parking can be a pain sometimes. It's a small space, so you might have to wait if it's busy. I've been fortunate enough that I've never waited.   As for the food, it's your typical breakfast/lunch joint that serves up your typical breakfast/lunch food. Nothing special. There's your omelettes, skillets, pancakes, sandwiches, wraps, etc. Nothing I've eaten here has been super OMG mind blowing. Like I said, it's very typical. Prices are on the lower end with no dish being over $15.  For the service, again nothing stellar. The servers we've encountered just looked like they were going through the motions. Not rude, but just enough friendliness to do their job. No smiles from anyone either.   Like I said, it's ok for me, but this definitely wouldn't be my first choice for breakfast."}
{"text":"Best fresh squeezed orange juice ;) The food was great!! Service was awesome!! Cooking style could be updated a little. The soup was greasy and the omelette might as well have been scrambled eggs."}
{"text":"This is an awesome breakfast and lunch spot too bad it's too small and gets really packed because their food is superior and delicious. I am a fan of the red velvet pancakes they are so tasty and the toppings they come with are simply amazing I highly recommend that you stop in and give it a shot. The staff is really friendly and the owner is always around in case you need anything, overall very very nice place to go to with your family."}
{"text":"Love Griddlecakes! Food is delicious every time. Service is on spot. The owners Frank and Fatemah are the best!!  My favorite is the peanut butter pancakes! Great outside patio when weather is nice. Very clean. Wonderful neighborhood restaurant. They serve Mimosas and  Belinis !!"}
{"text":"Very good breakfasts and very friendly service.  An almost every weekend visit from our family."}
{"text":"Since I'm a biscuits and gravy connoisseur, this place definitely gets my vote! Can't say one negative thing about eating here. Yum yum!"}
{"text":"Cute little breakfast place. After passing by a few hundred times we decided to pop in and check it out.   I think making the door a little bit more noticeable would be helpful. It was just a white door with no sign. I honestly thought the front door could've been the back door!   This place has a home style feel to it. The decor made me feel like I was at grandmas place having breakfast. Very welcoming and warm.  Portions are big. Although I did make sure I didn't get anything that was too big. I looked around at people's food and boy were the portions huge.   I got red velvet hot cakes which were pretty delish. 1 hot cake can feed 2! I also got a biscuit with gravy. Everytime I order biscuits and gravy there has always been some sort of meat in it, most of the time sausage but theres do not come with sausage. BUT it was my fault to assume this one would. The biscuit was a good size with ton of gravy.   I really don't like how the kitchen where the cooking is done is very visible. I don't know what it is but I just do not like watching my food being made. That's just a pet peeve of mines.  Staff was wonderful. It was a pleasant visit."}
{"text":"Went in for breakfast as we are right around the corner. The breakfast special advertised on the outside  ends at 7am I believe they said, although it says that nowhere on the sign, we were disappointed because it was not even 9am. The inside looks very good judging by the outside I thought it would be hideous! The food was pretty good although for having an open kitchen it would be nice for the cook to of had some better hygiene standards."}
{"text":"Friendly staff but the service was very slow. Food was also very bland and greasy. Not impressed and wouldn't come a second time."}
{"text":"We left before even being seated. Waiter sees us waiting by the front door, but totally ignores us while handing people their checks, doesn't even acknowledge us standing there wanting a table. \"I'll be right with you\" would have been nice, instead of seeing us stand there, making eye contact with us and then turning his back on my wife and I. This was on March 13th around 10:25am. Doesn't matter how good the food might have been, you just don't treat customers like that."}
{"text":"Good food . Straight forward. Pancakes could be better if you separate egg from yolk."}
{"text":"I love this place! The service is stellar and they remembered us after only a couple times in. We usually get a skillet and the potatoes are perfectly done. Buttery crust on the outside and soft on the inside. The biscuits and gravy have been taken up a notch recently and are just delish! I love that I don't get that nasty sluggish feeling after eating here either! Just like a good home cooked meal. They have a few locations but you can still feel that it's a family run business:) At the Summerlin location my bf and I sit outside on the patio when the weather's nice, we eat inside when we've got the kids because they have a great little play area that keeps them entertained:) One of our favorite breakfast spots, hands down!"}
{"text":"Service was ok. The pancakes were good but the omelette was not. The men's bathroom was a mess. Seating area is not great but they do well for the space they have available. I guess we are just used to Egg Works.  They set the bar high compared to this place. Will not go back."}
{"text":"Good service but seriously sub par food...gravy that's so obviously out of a can I almost couldn't bring myself to eat it. Taste was bland and I didn't even finish half my plate. My wife's Buffalo chicken wrap was under whelming as well, but not as bad as my \"country gravy\" straight from the factory. Needless to say we will not be back.   For any other breakfast places out there...if you want to stay in business you better be making your stuff from scratch. There are too many good options in town to be messing around. Sadly, I don't think this place will be here long if they don't make some needed changes."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place where you can tailor what you want, size of pancakes, upgrade your batter, and include sides. Great variety of their own pancakes. I got the protein oatmeal pancakes (huge single) with egg whites, and turkey sausage. Nice and friendly service!! Need to try their lunch menu."}
{"text":"Went back to the Griddle today for a quick power breakfast before starting the day. Had the Turkey Sausage Patties with 3 Poached Eggs, and wonderful Sourdough bread.  My girlfriend choose the Sausage biscuit w/gravy, poached eggs.  Everything came out prompt and tasted spectacular.  It's been a while since my first visit to The Griddle, but I must say that it beats the Original Sunrise Cafe hands down, and makes the very top of my breakfast list for that area of town."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful experience from right when we walked in the door, customer service was great, staff was very nice! Good was amazing!! French toast was delicious and western plate was perfect! Place is just great overall. Would love to come back! Sadly we were visiting the area."}
{"text":"The food was great and very affordable. The pancakes were huge and my skillet was delicious. The service was pleasant and i enjoyed this new breakfast spot."}
{"text":"First time here and really enjoyed my omlette!  The potatoes were also cooked crispy and were very good!  I got chicken, peppers, spinach and mushrooms and added feta. So good!  This place is always busy,  and that's a great sign.  Staff is very attentive,  too. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I like this place!  I abso-freaking-lutely love living so close to Eastern Avenue! The area from around the 215 to roughly St Rose has so many great food choices! I still have yet to try half of the places I've seen driving thru the area!  Griddlecakes is located in the same shopping plaza as Smashburger, Beach Hut Subs, and Pin Kaow Thai Restaurant. It's kind of tucked away in the back corner though, so it may be easy to miss without a little effort.  It's a small little place. It has a down home, Mom and Pop type feel to it. We were greeted as we walked thru the door and led to our booth. Our waitress was friendly and hooked up our drinks-pronto.  It didn't take long to decide what we wanted. I hadn't had a good skillet in a long while! So we both just ordered a couple of skillets. They weren't terribly busy, so our food came out pretty fast...and,damn, was it delicious! Portions were pretty good sized too!  Our waitress was attentive and friendly. We never had to wait for our drinks to be refilled. That is my waitress litmus test right there....if I have to wait a long time or have to hunt somebody down for a refill, it will reflect in my tip and Yelp! Fortunately, this place passed with flying colors!  I'm looking forward to coming back again and trying out more menu items, especially those omelettes! Mmmmmmmm....Omelettes!!  so...yea...this is an easy..  4 stars."}
{"text":"We found this place after searching for something off the strip. The reviews were so-so, but that didn't stop us. I'm so glad. We were there pretty early, so it wasn't crowded. Service was prompt and friendly. Prices were a little bit more than I normally pay for breakfast, but hey, it's Vegas and I was on vacation.   I ordered the chicken and waffle, and boy was it good. The waffle was in the shape of a flower and it was delicious. The chicken was a boneless breast that was perfectly fried. The meal was very filling and really good.   The hub ordered an egg breakfast with home fries, toast and bacon. He ate it all with a smile on his face. The biggest thing is they got his eggs right which doesn't always happen, and the bacon was rockin'. So he was happy.   We will definitely go back when in Vegas."}
{"text":"Greatttt food. Chicken and waffles were amazing. Small place so usually a wait but if you have a couple extra minutes, it's well worth it."}
{"text":"Tried their eggs benedict griddle and it was TDF.  The gal who served us was the one who came up with the special.  Great service, awesome food,  resonably-priced and imaginative menu. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I now know why this is place has only 3 1/2 stars. I Decided to come here for some Sunday brunch, which is my favorite day for snacking adventures, and I was pretty disappointed. Everything here looked appetizing, but in this case looks were definitely deceiving.   Griddlecakes is located in a small space in a strip mall, which means your wait time can be anywhere from 5 minutes to 45 minutes. Lucky enough, I only waited for about 15 minutes then was promptly seated. Before I knew it; I had three coffees in front of me: two hot, one cold, two glasses of ice water and a cup of ice. Can you say \"overly helpful\" wait staff? I'm not complaining about that, it was great that I didn't have to ask for anything because they were so on it!   The food arrived shortly after, like I said before it LOOKED amazing, I ordered the \"Philly Skillet\", this is a deconstructed philly cheese-steak sandwich minus the bread. It comes on a bed of potatoes a lot of delicious melted cheese and to add to this heaping mound of meat, cheese, and cardiac arrest, I also ordered a side of biscuits and gravy. This is where the meal starts to go downhill. The biscuits where ok, but the gravy was watery and pretty bland. The \"Philly Skillet\" was ok, but over-salted. Everything was cooked well, the steak was perfect, the potatoes were firm, but almost every bite had to be followed with a sip of water. I went through two glasses of water while eating this and I didn't even finish the whole thing.   My brunching buddy ordered the \"Crab Cakes Benedict\" and the \"Red Velvet\" Pancakes\"; these too were disappointing. The crab cakes had a very fishy taste, like the meat was from a can. The hollandaise sauce was good, but not good enough to save the dish. The Red Velvet Pancakes, were also a loss. These just tasted like a flat red velvet cake, very dense not fluffy like a pancake should be. They also had a raspberry sauce drizzled on top, which was peculiar. Normally you don't associate red velvet cake with raspberries.    My review for Griddlecakes is a tad tough; I was teetering between a three star review and a two star review. I decided to go with the two star review because this food was not \"A-OK\". This location is very clean and the service is impeccable. The food just fell far short of what I was expecting, over-salted and questionable flavor choices. I WILL be coming back to Griddlecakes because I believe in second chances for both people and foodies alike."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been here and it was ok again. Walked in and we were greeted and free to chose any seating. The menu has a great variety of items. I went ahead with the Florentine benny and my friend ordered chicken and waffles. We also got a free pancake for checking in. My benny was good, sauce was on point but the egg was a little over cooked, the yolk was mostly solid inside. My friends waffles were yummy and the chicken was perfectly cooked. The free pancake had great flavor and was big and fluffy. Serving size was generous too. I guess I felt this place to be average for a couple of reasons. 1. I didn't get a water refill until I was done with all my food 2. Our server wasn't very friendly, maybe she was having an off day. It seemed like she didn't want to be there that day. 3. Parking is hard because it's in a shopping center and fills up quickly. I don't know what it was but I didn't feel like it was above average maybe it was the experience. Either way this place has good food I might come back but this time I'll order to go."}
{"text":"First time eating here. Very impressed with service and quick food delivery after ordering. Jordan, our server was attentive and made sure our coffee was warm and filled! Thank you Jordan.  German chocolate pancakes is EXCELLENT!! Highly recommend. There are others I need to try that looked tasty. Price very reasonable and affordable.  I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Good food, great service - the biscuits and gravy were not quite as good as my mom's, but still tasty. Cozy atmosphere - much better than a big breakfast chain."}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoyed coming here for breakfast. I especially enjoyed the Mediterranean Salad, but I couldn't finish it.  At that point I went up to the man behind the counter and asked if, in the future, they could make a \"half salad\" for me.  He said, \"Sure.\" The last time I was here, they made a half salad and charged me $2 less. Everyone was happy. This time they refused to make it for me. The owner (or the boss, or whatever) came over and said  they don't do that anymore.   There was more conversation, but it's not important now.....something about me not wanting to waste food... Anyway..... we won't return."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast stop. My mother used to have breakfast with me alone on girls day. The food is great, the service is fantastic, and it's a happy spot."}
{"text":"As a new addition to our growing part of town, I welcome this place with open arms!   I love breakfast food so I definitely approved of this place. It was little bit tricky to find if you do not look them up ahead of time. The place is gorgeous inside. I love the big windows letting natural light in. The staff and the owner were all super nice and accommodating. They checked up on us so many times and even suggested specials that we can try for next time. They even gave us coupons for half price off our next visit!  Their specialties are pancakes but they have traditional breakfast food and sandwiches that they offer. I tried the Monkey Business because it reminded me of Chunky Monkey! It has good flavors and I really like bananas with peanut butter anyway so that is definitely a good one.   Overall, it was a pleasant experience. I will definitely come back and try their other pancakes!"}
{"text":"Came here for the second time and once again, thoroughly enjoyed it! The food is always fresh and tasty, the service (especially Amber) is friendly & efficient.. great place for breakfast & lunch! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"We haven't been here for awhile and now we remember why. We went here on a Friday afternoon and they weren't busy so we got a table right away. Got our drinks and ordered the Great Gobbler skillet with biscuits and gravy and my boyfriend ordered the Lumberjack Special. When we got our food, everything was still warm except for the biscuits and gravy which was very COLD! I wanted to let our waiter know but he didn't come back to us until we were half way done with our meal. When I was finally able to tell him that the biscuits and gravy were served cold, he didn't even apologized and just told me he'll get me a new one which NEVER CAME! I watched our waiter handle other things at the counter and return to his other tables but not ours. What did came was the check that was given to us by another waiter! So basically, the food was ok and nothing special - the home fries lacked a lot of flavor that me and my boyfriend had to douse them with salt and pepper and ketchup just to give it life. But getting a side of COLD biscuits and gravy ruined my experience plus having the waiter forget about replacing it made it clear that we picked the wrong place to dine. We will not be coming back here at all - we'll stick to Mr. Mama's where the owner was super friendly and the food tastes way better and served hot!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in town! Pancakes on point! Great staff! Hamed  & nick give the best service!"}
{"text":"Update: griddle cakes is still the best ever. For sure will be back. Came from California and don't mind the drive to come here!"}
{"text":"I was really disappointed with our experience for breakfast. I was so excited to have a new place to try that was within walking distance from our home but, after trying it I do not think I'll be going again.  For a restaurant that only serves breakfast and lunch the menu didn't have many choices. (It was only one page for both). I also would think that you would be serving the freshest ingredients possible yet, that was not the case either. I ordered a skillet as those are usually my favorite. I couldn't even eat it. I only ate part of my eggs as they weren't incorporated into the skillet as it would normally be. (I guess that was a blessing). The potatoes which are my absolute favorite were actually freezer burned!!! They were not palatable. The restaurant itself is very nice and appeared clean but, the service was not what it should have been. It wasn't busy and I would have thought that the server would have bothered to notice that the food was barely touched. I have to say that I was very disappointed and had hoped that this could have been a new place for us to frequent since it was so close and convenient. I hope that they notice and make some changes."}
{"text":"first time...great service and the food was good. kind of pricey for breakfast and it's just bfast food nothing special about it."}
{"text":"Meh. I had the Philly skillet. Very bland.  Sourdough tasted very funny like it was toasted over an open propane flame if that makes any sense at all.  If I go back I'll for sure try something else."}
{"text":"Here for breakfast!   I love Country Fried Steaks and from all those I've had in Las Vegas, this place has it going on. The French toast was delicious as well. Oh and I can forget to mention the freshly squeezed orange juice. Everything hit the spot!"}
{"text":"Decent breakfast and lunch spot! Great coffee, low prices, good quality food and good sized portions. The menu isn't as expansive as competing breakfast chains, but I think theirs is more original and certainly gets the job done for my tastes! I will be back for late weekend breakfasts."}
{"text":"First time here and the service plus the food were amazing. We are always looking for new places for breakfast and this one is definitely at the top of our list. I had the Hobo, potatoes, eggs, grilled onions and cheese. Omg talk about amazing. I'm in love with this place and I will 100% be back."}
{"text":"Very nice place. We had a very good breakfast.  The side of pancake was so big I ate the other half for breakfast the next day."}
{"text":"Nice local breaky place.  Eggs and potatoes were cooked perfectly. Pancakes fluffy.  Service a little disorganized but was friendly and good overall."}
{"text":"The food is good and the customer service is good. What more can you ask for? Faster service! We come here on our lunch time so we usually have less than an hour. This place is never packed and doesnt have more than 2-3 tables at a time, but for some reason it takes a long time for the food to come out. Just make sure you ask for the check and to-go boxes when you get your food."}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast and really enjoyed it. It's a cute little breakfast and brunch spot. I started with the strawberry mimosa...which was awesome! Actually like it better then the original mimosas with OJ. For my meal I had the gobbler skillet it was yummy. It's a pretty big plate so I was super stuffed after. My mom had the Florentine Eggs Benedict which she liked. My son had the kids pancakes... It was really cute came with a whip cream smiley face. I'll definitely check it out again soon!"}
{"text":"I was most impressed by the service. It was SO fast! I ordered and the next thing I knew I had my food! I got the chicken bacon sandwich and added avocado. The avocado was a great addition, but they weren't very generous with the slices. Ever having a craving for fries, bam! This is your place. The fries were great! I didn't get any breakfast items, but my friend said the biscuits and gravy were goods but she missed the sausage in the gravy. To be fair the waitress did give fair warning."}
{"text":"One of our all time favorite breakfast places!!!! We love the staff and the Arizona is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"What happened? Been here a number of times before and it was good but this is the last time! Unfriendly staff, requested crispy bacon got burnt bacon, sent it back and got an attitude with soggy and cold bacon, of course no apology!  Had to wait for to get servers attention to get some syrup, thought their specialty is pancakes?  The only good thing is server refilled our coffee without asking. Make sure you use you free pancake with check in before you order as they won't take it off your bill."}
{"text":"I found this place after taking my aunt to a doctors appointment nearby. After finding it on Yelp... We tried it out... And I'm glad I did! Everything is amazing! I had the pumpkin French toast... And we tried the pumpkin pancakes...And I've come because these home fries are BOMB.COM! Service is spectacular and prices are great! I'll will gladly make the drive for this place!!"}
{"text":"It's not really griddle cakes, that's just the name! Food was good, service was good. A little pricey, but that's Vegas for you."}
{"text":"Food is always delicious and Hamed and his team provide excellent service!  Great neighborhood restaurant to visit for breakfast or lunch.  The Lover short stack was AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Today Friday June 15th Noon time  I could smell amazing bacon and burger being cooked as we pulled in the front.  Amber greeted us and told us we could pick a booth or table.  The menu all sounded good and I couldn't decide.  I ended up choosing the canned corn beef with over hard eggs and sour dough.  My boyfriend wanted to try 3 Churro style French toast.  Amber is super personable, attentive and has a great smile.  She did make dining here fun and checked on us regularly.  I loved my food but somebody else at the table said their food was really good but too sweet and I had eat half of his third French toast because it smelled amazing.  Win win, I wanted to try his and ended up being stuffed as we left here.  The tall gentlemen checked on us during our meal which was nice and later was at the podium to cash us out.  Great cook and the staff was so happy too!  They have good mood food.  The burger at the next table looked and smelled wicked awesome. :)  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Came here with my friend for brunch and it was lickity split! We were greeted by our host who introduced us to our server Yeshi. I had orange juice with the garden sandwich and my friend had the corn beef hash with eggs and French toast. I had to add avocado and tobasco to my sandwich for more flavour. Other than that this place was pretty small in size with fun poppy colours. We came, we ate and we conquered all of our food."}
{"text":"How can I possibly give an establishment one star if  I have never eaten there, or even been inside?  I will tell you!    We spotted this restaurant while driving around and tried to make a mental note of where it was located because we frequent Harvest Cafe and wanted a back-up if it was good.  Unfortunately we never found this place again until last week.  Eureka!  We decided to go and check it out as soon as possible so I called them and the lady who answered the phone said they were open until 3 p.m.  3 p.m.?  Who can make a living only being open from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m.  Isn't this Vegas?  You know 24/7 or at least 8 p.m.  When we arrived there was one car in the parking lot just leaving...ut oh...the place is empty!  All the signs in the windows say they close at 2 p.m!  2 p.m.?  You've got to be kidding!  We missed it by 5 minutes?  And, who spells  \"country cafe\"  with K's?  You cannot possibly find this place with any app or yellow page looking for \"cafes\" - I know as I searched for weeks!  So make a note it's open from 7-2.  Guess it's good for breakfast and lunch, but not for dinner.  I sure wish they were, because if they are good we certainly could use another cafe around here."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast this morning. Arrived right when they were opening and we were told we could sit anywhere we liked.  Our waitress was polite and attentive throughout the meal. Food arrived promptly and was good and hot.  The place was a little pricey at $35 for two of us. But service and the selections on the menu will have us coming back again."}
{"text":"Upon entering Griddlecakes we were warmly welcomed and offered to seat ourselves.  Unfortunately our server didn't introduce himself but he was friendly and willing to accommodate a table change when a booth opened. The establishment was very clean.  THE FOOD:  I ordered the crab cake benedict. I have to say it was amazing! My girlfriend ordered the gobbler skillet. The skillet was ok and the large cubed house fries were bland.  THE BAD: The coffee was mediocre and I do not recommend the biscuits and gravy. We ordered those and the biscuit was cold with a luke warm gravy that contained no sausage and overly peppered. Additionally they served it to us much later after the meal arrived."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat! The staff is friendly and attentive. The food is delicious and the portions are generous. If you are not super hungry I would recommend sharing a dish with someone, (and there still might be leftover even after that!). They also make espresso here for you coffee lovers!  The environment is relaxed and the noise levels are fairly low, making this a great place to hang out with friends and be able to have a nice conversation without having to talk over one another just to hear. Overall my group and I had a great experience and enjoyed ourselves very much!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food. It wasn't really hot. It's was served very quickly which tells me it's in a warming tray. Very nice staff. Not sure if we will come back"}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday breakfast and got the birthday pancakes and it was awesome! Delicious food and great customer service"}
{"text":"It was ok I had better service was great but not the best breakfast I'm big about not going to big corporate places keep it family own or little business I just was not empress"}
{"text":"I left Rochester, NY 10 years ago and lived in Durham, NC for the last 10 years and just moved to Henderson last week. Since I left Rochester I have not been able to find a breakfast restaurant that served real homefried potatoes until I ate at Griddlecakes this morning. The homefries were real potatoes and grilled on a grill just like back home in Rochester. The ham and cheese omelette I ordered was loaded with big chunks of ham and cooked to perfection. The service I received was fast and friendly the coffee was was flowing. You can tell that this is a family owned business and not part of a chain. I can't wait to return and try some other menu items and there are plenty to choose from. I will be back without a doubt probably many times."}
{"text":"Outside of myself and my daughter, there were only 4 tables with guests and 2 servers.  I'd say they weren't too busy.  Not sure why they were unable to warm my coffee up, ask how my meal was or check on us.  I know it was breakfast time but my daughter asked for a Diet Coke. Standard, you'd think.  The server told us they were out.  He did however have someone run to Vons and p/u a couple of cans which he brought over to us when the meal was over.  The food was mediocre and the potatoes in my skillet were far from cooked.   Definitely not going back again."}
{"text":"Second time eating here and happy both times. Anyone who follows me knows that I love breakfast but what's breakfast without coffee? Communism, exactly. No pinko nonsense at this place though, their coffee comes out hot and delicious not to mention that they have been great with keeping me topped up.   Today I'm eating one of their skillets. The gobbler. Turkey sausage, egg, spinach, peppers and cheese over taters. Smells great and very satisfying.   I'm a bit upset with myself that I didn't get pancakes. Had the lemon and blueberry cakes last time... wow. Highly recommended but you better pack your insulin. Once I tucked in I just kept devouring every bite until I drifted into a food coma.   This place is a bit small so come early or off peak but definitely come."}
{"text":"This place is just not good. The food is just ok, with small portions. The service is awful. No refills and having to ask for the check three times. The worst about the experience is the waiting to be seated. There is no direction at all. Do I just sit? Do I wait and if so where? Do i go up and order at the counter? There is a small do it yourself sign in sheet that they don't even look at. Had to ask twice where to sit because the first girl apparently didn't want to answer. Do yourself a favor and eat somewhere else, it's not worth it."}
{"text":"The staff was welcoming and very response. But our food was a bit cold, a little burnt and lacked flavor. Thus I rated the experience and food a two. I'm ambivalent about my experience and would feel comfortable saying the quality of food may vary according to time of day."}
{"text":"Disappointing. Used to be really good, but my food came out with no heat. Not cold, but like it had been sitting for a while. Coffee was watered down. They remade the food, and it was better, but no apologies, no acknowledgment about the problem. This is not the same great breakfast restaurant it used to be."}
{"text":"I love the skillets here. I usually go with the Arizona skillet. The seasoned ground beef is on point and it's a large portion with a biscuit and gravy on the side! Also remember to check in for a single huge pancake. I personally am not a fan of the pancakes here, but hey to each there on. Def try this place if you have a big appetite, you won't leave hungry."}
{"text":"Been there three times, and when I return it will be for the pancakes. An order of magnitude better than IHOP. Thick, fluffy and tasty. I ordered eggs over easy each time, and they nailed it. Bacon is decent, sausage (link or patty) are okay. At this point, my favorite place for pancakes. Service was a little slow but good. The kids meal was a large cluster of pancakes shaped like a mickey mouse head, with blueberries for the eyes, a round scoop of butter for the nose and whipped cream making a mouth (and a strip of bacon on each side).  Go there for the pancakes. Good stuff."}
{"text":"Staff is extremely kind and helpful. Food was prompt and DELICIOUS.  Thanks for making our morning!"}
{"text":"This place has good food, not great but good. The decor is outdated and needs a good cleaning but i guess it can be good if you're looking for an old fashion diner. Customer service is great and they get your food to you extremely fast."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! I've shared it with friends and family and I have yet to see anyone dislike anything they ordered. Overall all the atmosphere, the food and the customer service can't be beat!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast and basics for lunch. Reasonably priced compared to many other places.  This place is small with maybe a dozen tables and some outdoor seating soooo if you come during peak times especially weekends expect to wait. Staff if friendly and pleasant."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast spots in Vegas! This place can get pretty crowded because it is small and delicious! It is family friendly, and the service is superb.   Food - I have two favorites, and I can never decided which of the two to get. The Philly Skillet is the perfect hangover breakfast. It has cheese, steak, onions, and potatoes. It is a meal almost big enough for two. The second thing is the protein oatmeal pancakes with peanut butter and bananas. I have never been a big fan of pancakes, but this combo is something else. It is the perfect breakfast!   I have taken my family here when they come to visit, and they always ask if we can go there when they come back. Definitely a good place!"}
{"text":"I definitely love this place and their breakfast selections! The meat lover scramble is an all time favorite but every once in awhile I indulge in their signature pancakes. The Arnold is amazing but I just love bananas and peanut butter together. Clean place and great service are plus!"}
{"text":"Friendly service, great food (florentine benedict, french toast) and reasonable prices. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a breakfast/lunch place and happen to see their sign off of Eastern. Their potions are larger. I got the Garden Skillet and that came with 3 eggs, biscuits and gravy, mushrooms, onions, green bell peppers, tomatos w/cheese on top of home fries! The boyfriend got a breakfast burrito and he loved it! His uncle got a parfait and a short stack of pancakes. The parfait came in a fancy wine glass, filled with fresh strawberrys, banana, yogurt (plain and vanilla). Yum! Service was good. Asked what we wanted to drink shortly after we seated ourselves. Quick with the refills too. Prices were great for the portion size they give you. Kinda felt bad for not taking home my leftovers... I would definitely go back to try their other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Now called Stacks & Yokes...great family owned and operated restaurant....good PLENTIFUL food.  dignature stacks are AWESOME......Breakfast served all day and open till 9pm...Oh my !!!"}
{"text":"What a fun place to eat and enjoy the company of friends or loved one's over a full plate of food. I loved the Big Nevadan skillet I ordered. I had a side of biscuits & gravy, which went perfect with the skillet. See what you have to do is get a fork full of potatoes, beef, and bacon, and dip it in the gravy! DELICIOUSNESS!!! The orange juice is pulpy as all fucks, its like drinking an orange. But other than that, I loved the place. Friendly staff, even when slammed busy, and my water never got to empty. I will definitely be back again. Sooner than later!"}
{"text":"This place has good looking food with very plain flavor. The pancakes are amazingly drier than the desert. The biscuits and gravy are obviously microwaved.  Its a cool looking fresh place with friendly waitresses, though we are not privy to watching the chef work.  Their style of no flavor actually lends well to the tuna sandwich, which was plain and not overkilled by mayo. I added tomato and onion."}
{"text":"My first time at this place and I was pleasantly surprised. There wasn't anyone to greet us when we first got there so we just walked up to the counter to order our food. Everything on the menu looked delicious so I decided to try something unusual. The red velvet pancakes seemed like the best choice. It was like eating a red velvet cupcake but in a form of a pancake, it even had chocolate chips in it. The pancakes were thick, fluffy, huge and had some type of syrup drizzled over it. YUMMY! The 2 pancakes and orange juice came out to be under $10, totally worth it."}
{"text":"Sucks. Never coming here again. Service horrible. 4 tables that got here after us received their food before us. The waitress was clueless and came to our table once to see how we were. She should of been able to realize that our food still hadn't been delivered to our table. Save your money.   Food also sucked. French toast was sprinkled w cinnamon (too much cinnamon that you couldn't enjoy the meal) AND the manager didn't offer to comp anything. Paid $30 for bad service and food.    We waited for 40 minutes before anyone realized there was anything wrong and that others were getting their orders before us.  I understand that mistakes happen and usually I am happy to wait for them to fix the mistake but they seemed non remorseful for their mistake. They really don't care to make the customer happy or that they would lose a customer. That is sad. Adios!"}
{"text":"Food was great. Chicken and waffles were bomb. Saddie and Leah were great servers.  We recommend promoting Saddie to head of marketing."}
{"text":"Fast service, good breakfast,  great pancakes! Small establishment though so get there early!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this location as it is now known as Griddle Cakes. I had been many times before to the Kountry Kafe. Yelp says they open at 9:00, but they actually open at 7:00. Empty upon our arrival, it did get a little busier as time went on. I got the Chicken Fried Steak with eggs and home fries. I substituted a pancake for the toast for additional charge of $1.00. The pancake was outstanding and worth the extra charge. The CFS itself was very good. Nice and tender with plenty of flavor. The eggs and home fries were average, as was the coffee. I was not impressed with the orange juice. It seemed like Tang with pulp added. The waitress was pleasant and attentive, keeping the coffee cups full. A decent place for breakfast and one that I will visit again."}
{"text":"The service was great and the food was very tasty. I had the ABC skillet which was not on the menu, but our server told us about it. It came with avocado, bacon and chicken. My husband had the Nevadan skillet which he said was good as well. Our kids had the happy face pancake that was shaped like mickey mouse. The only complaint I have is that drinks are not included in the kids meal pricing and 1.99 per kids drink is a bit expensive or I would have probably given 5 stars. Will definitely come back and have the kiddos drink water next time lol."}
{"text":"Breakfast. Had the standard Lumberjack breakfast. 2 pancakes, 3 eggs, 3 bacon and potatoes. While it's pretty hard to screw up a lumberjack, it's also difficult to improve upon it. Griddlecakes DOES it, though! The stack was fluffy, eggs, bacon and potatoes cooked to perfection and EVERYTHING served piping hot HOT!  It's like the food goes from griddle to plate to table in 30 seconds. Staff is on top of things and super efficient and work in a friendly teamwork environment. Everyone was attentive and courteous.  Coffee could be a little hotter for my personal taste, but it was flavorful and constantly filled.  This place is a win win for breakkie. We will def be back."}
{"text":"Griddlecake came highly recommended as good comfort food. The food was good but the service was slow. We felt invisible to the staff. From the time we entered to the time we received our food was over 40 minutes  We noticed other guest that arrived after we did receive their food long before our order arrived  When our order finally arrived it was wrong and a portion had to be sent back and replaced. Eggs over easy is not hard and rubbery   We complained to the wait staff and was met with attitude and excuses. They gave us the Managers card and informed us they were out until Monday.    Time to scratch this place off the list"}
{"text":"Breakfast was good and the busser who was a woman was awesome! The server however who was a male needs a more welcoming demeanor. If he smiled it would be nice."}
{"text":"Love me some Griddlecakes! Overflow on my coffee, but they must know it's what I need to start my day! Lol I lovvvvve their potatoes!"}
{"text":"This place is great!  The food is delicious and it's inexpensive. The service was very good, the employees are friendly.  I had the single stack birthday cake pancake with a side of bacon and house potatoes. My boyfriend had the build your own burger and a side of fries. It was our first time visiting but I can definitely say we will be back!  We highly recommend this place to anyone living in or visiting Vegas!"}
{"text":"We always like to try places that have pancakes as their specialty. It's a nice little place with cute decor but don't come here when it's busy, otherwise you will have nowhere to sit. There are very few tables. Our waitress was very friendly and the service was fast.   Now on to the food, the lemon blueberry pancakes were pretty good. They are huge and can probably feed like 3 people easily. I ordered corned beef hash, it came with eggs, potatoes and toast. The corned beef hash is the kind from the can like Libby's brand. Now I like canned corned beef over the real thing, so that worked for me. The potatoes were so plain, they needed flavor! And my toast was burnt as can be. But she was busy so I didn't even bother. Price wise, it's about average for a breakfast spot. Would I come back? No, I make a better breakfast at home."}
{"text":"Griddle cakes does not have their SuMmerline location......too bad they can't update their information on this site.  We wasted our time looking for the place.....went over to Egg Works."}
{"text":"I live in the area and my mom and I decided to stop by for brunch. I ordered the red velvet griddlecakes, bacon, & eggs. Everything was simply amazing!!! It's a small establishment but I love supporting local businesses. If you're in the Silverado ranch area you should definitely check them out! I've already been twice this week! I may have found my new breakfast place!!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out with my husband.  The service was friendly and attentive.  The food was average.  We ordered the protein oatmeal pancake which were good just dry (butter needed for sure).  We also ordered the bacon sausage potato and eggs (eggs and bacon were yummy but sausage was not great prob frozen).  Overall the place is good just they will probably need to step it up to compete with all the other breakfast places in the area.  Come and try this place out support ur local businesses."}
{"text":"What an amazing breakfast. The hostess/ waitress was so darn sweet, i had the monkey business pancakes and wow! Loved it if you could just remember the peanut butter banana sandwich's your mom made you as a kid! Turn it into a stack of pancakes."}
{"text":"This place is extra ok. Ordered the crab benedict which was decent, a tuna croissant and an Arnold pancake. Nothing was worth me coming back to order again. Maybe I'm just a finicky eater. Not gross just not great."}
{"text":"The food is a great as the staff. Totally worth every penny. Clean, great food, not too long of a wait and super helpful staff that are real team players who help one another so, you don't have to wait for anything you need. One of my most favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"Always have the pleasure of having Marisa as our server. Great staff, amazing breakfast! Highly recommended !"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!  The food is delicious.  I am normally not a breakfast eater at all but the pancakes and chorizo scramble are the most delicious things in the world.  All foods come in large portions and for such a great price!!  I love that you can choose a pancake depending on your mood that day.  There is a pancake for everyone, they seriously have any flavor you can think of!  Management is so friendly and always checks on all guests to make sure everything top notch and the servers are always so friendly.  This place has such a homey comfortable vibe."}
{"text":"The Griddle is a fantastic breakfast spot that delivers a satisfying amount of tasty classics in a cozy environment.  The staff works hard and they always seem to have smiles on their faces.  My favorite meal is the Lumberjack, offering up three eggs, sausage or bacon, hash browns and two pancakes the size of Toyota Prius tires.  I've also had the pleasure of having a customized omelet, also oversized and plenty tasty.  You can tell the food is good because the last couple of times we've gone there's been a short wait.  It's a pretty small joint, so if they enjoy continued success maybe they'll be able to expand, especially since no other restaurants in that plaza can seem to stay in business.  Do not even think about having breakfast at the IHOP or Denny's right down the street when the Griddle is available."}
{"text":"The gobbler skillet + birthday cake short stack + excellent service = 5 stars ! Can't wait for the cotton candy mimosas"}
{"text":"Excellent pancakes. Interesting flavor combs. Large portions. Nice outside seating dog friendly"}
{"text":"I was going to grab brunch with a couple of friends late Sunday morning. The group decided on DW Bistro. I was not thrilled with this choice. I've previously eaten there and didn't like their menu or service. I was told things would be different because they moved. We attempted to go to DW and even I didn't like about the place was the same. The menu was the same as the last location and there looked like 40 people waiting just inside the door with no clear line or indication in where the hostess is. So after 5 minutes in the mad house,  we left.   My friend guided us to Griddlecakes near by. I am so glad that he did. There was no line. We were greeted by someone opening the door and welcoming us. We were seated right away. As soon as we received the menus I was so happy for the change in venue. There were so many things that I found appealing compared to the other restaurant where I struggled to find anything I wanted.   I chose the Blue Jay (lemon blueberry pancakes) and added a side of bacon. One friend got the Monkey Business ( peanut butter pancakes). And added a side of home fries. My other friend got the chorizo scramble. We each shared bites. The portions were very generous for the price. Everything ordered was delicious.  I would have preferred the home fries to be more well done than what my friend received.  I'll request them that way the next time I'm here.   I was very happy with my order and liked it the best. I do wish the pancakes had been served with more blueberry compote but upon request I received more with no problem or charge. I was not a fan of the bacon. I don't believe the issue was the cooking but rather the product itself. The bacon was odd. If you told me that it was turkey or vegan bacon I would believe it. I think they should consider buying a different kind.   The service was excellent. Not only was our server attentive but other servers were as well. We felt very valued and well taken care of. I'm sorry I haven't been to this place sooner. This is the best breakfast spot I've been to in Vegas and worth the drive."}
{"text":"Well the food was amaze balls. Service not so much. Funny thing is I swear our server started limping after my friend I may have been overheard talking about the service.  Yeah to go orders are very important but since they weren't actually there to pick it up I feel like packing it up while my food sat in the window getting wasn't the smartest choice. Maybe Im wrong.  Aside from that the same lady that packed the to go food was seen coming from the kitchen chewing. So not professional. I think I get why the stars are lower here than the other location."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff and my vegan/vegetarian option was the garden melt without feta and I added avocado. My hubby and I traded our potato options. I had his home fries and he had my regular fries. I highly recommend home fries instead of French fries."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here Christmas Eve morning and it was great! The service was friendly, quick and inviting. No complaints about the food either. The pancakes were huge and fluffy which is the best. I got the traditional eggs benedict with the potatoes, very good. Small, modern, quiet restaurant but will be back again! Easy, quick location for me."}
{"text":"It isn't anything spectacular but it isn't terrible either. Sometimes the food is a little extra crispy and sometimes it is just right. I would give it 4 stars but really must give it 3 because it isn't consistent every time and certain things have been questionable. I will say this though, IHOP is right across the street but I would defiantly choose this place over them any day. That still doesn't say a whole lot about this place.  I usually order waffles. If it isn't overcooked it is very tasty. I tried the chicken and waffles once but the chicken just seems like a frozen chicken finger they nuked and put on top.  The eggs are usually the only thing cooked perfect and they do taste good. I have asked for sides before such as extra ranch or mayo and gotten weird extras in the cup it was brought in.   Basically, this place isn't bad every once in a while but to take family and friends I would go t Rachel's Kitchen or up to Bagel Cafe. I get a coupon every now and then in the mail and that is when I generally eat there."}
{"text":"It was my first time here. Service was good, food good not expensive. I ordered traditional egg Benedict, orange and cappuccino.  Everything was delicious."}
{"text":"I took my 16 month old to have breakfast at this joint right after her dentist appointment since we didn't have eggs at home and this munchkin loves eggs in the morning.  When we arrived, there was only one other gentleman dining there.  The staff grabbed us a high chair and it was dirty.  I ordered the orange juice and she brought out a large without asking me what size I wanted.  One sip and I had to let her know that the orange juice is spoiled.  She asked if I wanted another beverage but because I wanted fresh OJ, I asked if there is another batch.  She brought me a small so I can try and yes, this batch is fresh alright.  She then brought out a large for me.  I also ordered a corn beef hash which comes with three eggs, sad looking potatoes, and 2 pcs of toast.  I am used to the potatoes being nice and crispy...not here.  The corn beef hash was very mushy.  Needless to say, service was good, but the food was not; therefore, I won't be returning."}
{"text":"My 11 year old twins are the picky eaters and they loved this place . It was the first time they finished their plates. They are very accommodating and very friendly. The food is excellent."}
{"text":"Food not worth the money...pancakes were chewy ...looking around at tables where people left..most didn't finish even one pancake.  Use packaged creamers like 7'11.  They are friendly.  Won't come back."}
{"text":"Food was OK, service was better but yet something was missing. M and I, we love our Breakfast and theres not much you can screw up. Yet the cook did  over easy eggs but  not turned very easy and my bacon was a little on the blacken side, coffee can be improved. M expressed that the short stack was just Blah...   would we return, NO."}
{"text":"Wow, what a breakfast!  The service was amazing and the food was perfect!  My son had eggs and silver dollar pancakes and then pancakes were better than expected.  I had the french toast which I do not usually order when out becuase the inside in usually soggy.  This was one of the best stack of french toast that I've had in years!  Cooked perfectly with the right amount of cinnamin.  I will be back and can't wait to try lunch!"}
{"text":"Went here with my girlfriend for breakfast after we got a coupon in the mail.  It's both modern and cozy inside and outside.  It has maybe 10 booths and 3 tables.  A waiter or waitress is never very far away.  Prices seemed reasonable but when we got down to the food and service it left a lot to be desired.  First off when we came in we weren't greeted and were unsure if we should seat ourselves or not.  After a moment a waiter or manager came over and said they'd clean a booth off for us since there were no clean ones.  It was done within a minute but the rag they used to clean it off was very dirty/moldy and we could smell it on the table.  When utensils were set for us the waiter noticed my fork was dirty so he retrieved a new one.  Two different people came over to take our drink orders.  I ordered hamburger steak with scrambled eggs, home fries, and wheat toast.  My girlfriend got corned beef hash with sunny side up eggs, home fries, and sourdough toast.  Food was delivered fairly quickly although instead of having A1 Steak Sauce, they had a Kroger 1883 steak sauce which wasn't too good.  Also they gave us all our toast on one plate, which was a bit annoying.  The scrambled eggs and toast were fine, and my girlfriend liked her corned beef hash. I thought the flavoring of the home fries was good although some of them were undercooked and my girlfriend did not like the flavoring at all.  The hamburger steak was a bit gristly and my girlfriend said her eggs were very undercooked and practically cold in the middle.  We won't go back again.  Nothing was overly offensive or anything like that.  It's just that we both would prefer other places like Blueberry Hill or Denny's."}
{"text":"Breakfast was so so. Orange juice was really good (fresh squeezed), but the charge for refills, so it wound up being pretty pricey for breakfast (we had a couple glasses each)."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday during peak hour and they let me call ahead, which was awesome.  We got seated outdoors quickly and it was a beautiful day and the other diners had their dogs with them which I liked.  I jokingly asked for \"the biggest coffee you have\" and ended up with a larger mug than my friend which made us both laugh.  The food was good and so was the service."}
{"text":"I hate to give a business 2 stars based on one visit, and if I return and they improve so will my rating of them.  Service was a little slow which is to be expected on a Sunday morning.  Staff was very friendly.  My 2 stars is based on the fact that I ordered my steak medium and it  was beyond well done.  I didn't even take it home for my fur babies.  In fact, just thinking about it right now puts a frown on my face.  They did have a variety of menu choices and the prices were fair."}
{"text":"This place is incredible.  Really fresh food that is freshly made when you order it.  There is a great selection of breakfast items to suit everyone's needs. Good service with the wait staff offering selections and their favorites. Just moved to this side of town and will be going here a lot!"}
{"text":"Moderate food. Crappy coffee. Horrible service.  Table of 5 and 4 people received their food while the last one had to wait. Empty coffee cups, only to be refilled on the table while pouring in the direction of people eating. $2 to add 2 sliced strawberries and whipped cream onto a waffle."}
{"text":"I found this place driving to my sisters house and came the next day. I was skeptical because I saw that they just opened 2 weeks ago? Well, I have to say they're pancakes are amazing! And I'm not even a pancake person. I got the razzle dazzle pancake, just one because they are huge! And I ended up getting build it yourself omelette with mushroom, tomatoes, and chorizo.   Overall, the service was great and food was awesome so I will be returning again and again! :)"}
{"text":"Almost felt discouraged from coming here because of the recent string of bad reviews.  Went here for the first time around noon on a Tuesday and had a great experience! Once we saw the waitress, she asked us if we wanted to sit inside or outside (we said outside) and got us menus. I settled for two red velvet pancakes while my brother had eggs and two pancakes (one red velvet, the other blueberry).  The portion was in the middle for me, not too big not too small. It was a lot more filling than I expected and had to take the rest home. Now I know I can get by on one and completely avoid the full stack option. The syrup that was on the red velvet was delicious, I loved how the syrup and the powdered sugar was presented in a criss cross pattern! The chocolate chips added another layer of flavor to the red velvet and thankfully they didn't go overboard with the chips."}
{"text":"Orange juice was brought warm, pancakes had a hair, and waiter barely checked up.  This was on top of a 20 min wait to be seated.  Better off going to Denny's..."}
{"text":"Honestly, I don't know why the average rating for this place is so low. Griddle is my \"go to\" breakfast joint in Las Vegas. They have the most solid food of anywhere I have been in town. You usually have to wait a little while on the weekends as they don't have a huge number of tables.  But, trust me, it's worth it. Overall service is friendly & prompt. The menu isn't crazy creative but it has all the good All-American breakfast/lunch choices. The pancakes are awesome but I always have to get the biscuits & gravy instead because the Griddle is the only place that makes them right (in my opinion). As a girl who relocated from Oklahoma, I am particular about my \"southern\" dishes and I'm here to tell you... The biscuits & gravy at The Griddle are the best in all of Las Vegas."}
{"text":"The staff are wonderful.  They truly care about the people who come in.  Good food... true desire to leave the customer happy."}
{"text":"Terrible breakfast experience. On 10/20 (a Monday) three of us were there for breakfast. It took an hour to get our food (although we saw many others get their food more quickly), the bacon was microwaved, the gluten free waffle was just dough. During that hour no one told us why it was taking so long.  We watched a woman come in and order a to-go breakfast, come back in 15 minutes and pick it up (while we waited), at another table the two guests ordered after we did, then ate and were replaced by a single person who ordered and ate--all before we ever got any food. It was not just us that was suffering, however. A couple near us got their sausage until finished with their meal after waiting about as long as we had (customer refused the sausage).  After we waited 45 minutes or so a woman, purportedly the manager or owner, arrived and visited tables where she knew people and solved their problems---but not us--and not others, only table where she knew people by name. I have been there at least 20 times by the way--but would not consider myself a regular.   Food took forever and was terrible when arrived.  To add insult to injury the woman in charge deducted two cups of coffee from our $33 bill.  Did you hear that?  She thought it was ok to make us wait an hour, get uncooked food and then try to make ut up to us by comping two cups of coffee!   Who gives a guest two cups of coffee for to make up for that experience? I know who does that, its a restauranteur who should not be in business, that's who.   I have sent many people to this little place over the years...never again. In addition, neither I nor anymore in my family will darken their doors again. This business has not idea what they are doing."}
{"text":"Late breakfast with my wife.  She had a short stack of pancakes with peanut butter.  I had biscuit and gravy.  Great food.  Anyone complaining about time is probably expecting Denny's.  They have a single short order cook, so you should plan for some time for your food, we waited twenty minutes.  My wife declared about half way through her meal that we have to come back.  This place reminded me of a hole in the wall place in the country."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for breakfast. The staff was very friendly and food was scrumptious, fresh served with a smile. Price was reasonable, cozy place with a couple of tables outside. They serve breakfast and lunch. We will be back. Oh they make different batters for pancakes which I'll try next time. My husband had corned beef and hash and he loved it! Nothing tasted greasy. Try this place you won't regret it!  Bon appetit'"}
{"text":"Visiting friends in Las Vegas and they suggested the Griddle for breakfast. Overall -- good just not special.  My hash was bland and my sons crab cake eggs benedict was not that good. The pancakes looked full and fluffy and the bacon more fat than sizzle. Eggs were cooked correctly and  fruit was fresh and coffee good."}
{"text":"It's a small cute little place. Decorations are warm and welcoming. The food is absolutely delicious. They have freshly squeezed orange juice! Their chicken and waffles are to die for! The service is really friendly and attentive. The table in the center are too close together."}
{"text":"We were excited to see a breakfast place so close to home and decided to give it a try. The service was very friendly, but the food was just meh... Pancakes were ok, a little dense. Sausage links had seasoning like McDonalds, which I like, just not as rich, they were pretty good. Home style potatoes, just meh, not much flavor. Bacon,,, um, horrid. As in thin, bad buffet bacon. Flavor was just not good. Wife said the toilet in the bathroom had a ring. The place was pretty light on customers when we got there at about 9:30am on a Sunday morning, but seemed to pick up a little by the time we left. We really like to support the small local businesses, but this place needs to step up their game a bit. Their prices justify expectations of better quality food, ingredients."}
{"text":"Before I start on the actual place review I want to THANK SO MUCH OUR SERVERS TONY AND FRANCISCO they gave us the best service everrrrrr!!! They had patience since it was really busy, friendly attitudes and that's what really makes people want to come back, the great service!!!   Now the place: WOWWWWW YUMMMMMMM  REALLY DELICIOUS ordered chicken bacon melt and the boo ordered omelette with country potatoes all BOMB!!!"}
{"text":"outstanding food and service! the most genuine employees and a wonderful breakfast! meat lover's scramble and the turkey sausage benedict were exceptional! look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"If you have ever wondered about this neighborhood restaurant, don't waste your time and energy.  Don't waste your money either.  The food was gross.  I had a breakfast skillet, I think they poured have a bottle of oil on the skillet.  The sausage was the cheap round ones cut into pieces.  Absolutely gross.  My husband ordered the chili size.  It was a frozen patty (not completely cooked) with canned chili on top.  The fries looked like they were cooked in year old grease and put right on the plate rather than letting the grease drip in a basket.  The waitresses, well they left a lot to be desired.  The one was rude and I never saw her clear a plate.  The second one that actually took our order was nice enough but had med length hair that was not tied back.  When she \"refilled\" my cup it was with a splash.  Never going back and hoping I do not get sick!!!"}
{"text":"The other yelp reviews are extremely generous.  Went here for brunch on Sunday. I ordered a burger, medium.  It was way beyond well done.  McDonalds has a tastier burger.  Service was even worse than the food.  The food took what seemed like forever to arrive, probably because they wanted to make sure my burger was really cooked.  I ordered a coffee that never came.  No excuse for the bad service since the restaurant was mostly empty."}
{"text":"Perfect spot again where Yelp needs 3.5 stars but with this one I am siding with the 4 stars. We went here the other morning for breakfast.   I had biscuits and gravy and who I was with had the hobo breakfast skillet.   Both meals where good diner food which was what was expected.  The staff was attentive and quite nice, not too much not too little but just right.   There are two groups meeting there a veterans type of group and a 2nd amendment rights group. Both of these made me like this place even more."}
{"text":"Griddlecakes is such an amazing place for breakfast! We had a sweet server named Audriana, we ordered the garden skillet, red velvet pancakes, lemon blueberry pancakes, French toast & the brunch burger. They were all amazing!  They checked on us throughout our time and make sure  we got everything we needed. It was a great time!"}
{"text":"Hmmmmmmm.  How to describe The Griddle.  A no frills, typical cafe diner with frozen/ready made chicken and potatoes, rubbery scrambled eggs, unripe fruit, and gross coffee.  But their lemon blueberry pancake was delicious.  They got an extra star for that."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate there this afternoon. We both were pleasantly surprised. The food was awesome and the price was reasonable. We both agreed we both have a favorite place!"}
{"text":"Came here during lunch time with some coworkers. Place was clean and we had great   customer servive. Food portions were good and the pancakes were huge! I just got the basic buttermilk and they were so fluffy. Price is about average with other breakfast places so no complaints there. Also the philly skillet had some of the most flavorful meat; add some avocado to it."}
{"text":"Small little corner restaurant that makes this and use of their space. The overall feeling is good in general but I'm not a fan of chairs that do not have cushioning on them"}
{"text":"I love this place there chicken strips are the best  Also the buffalo wrap ...friendly staff"}
{"text":"4 stars. Food is great. Has the home style flavor and look. Huge portions for a reasonable price. Only reason it's 4 stars and not five is the small size of the restaurant and being so small it gets loud quickly. So minus a star for that. Other than that the staff are very attentive and accommodating to families with rambunctious and screaming children. The place has a pleasant feel to it however despite the size.  Parking is a struggle however due to its location of sharing its lot with several other stores in the area.  All in all it's worth it to eat here and have a nice experience.  Happy dining."}
{"text":"I wish I liked this place.  It's literally walking distance from my house.    The restaurant is clean and open. We came at 2 pm so it was fairly empty.  Actually we were the only ones there...   The service is great. Our server was so sweet and nice but the food was just terrible.   My friend and I both ordered the chicken and waffle entree after seeing photos on Yelp. The dish was unbearably salty.  I had to drench the chicken in syrup to take it down. The waffle was a bit chalky not fluffy or crispy like I expected.   I can't see myself coming back unless I wanted something simple like eggs and bacon and was too lazy to go to the store."}
{"text":"Excellent service, delicious food, everything was phenomenal. I thoroughly enjoyed every second spent in their restaurant. 5/5"}
{"text":"My wife and  decided to eat here on a Sunday morning, excited about try a new place for breakfast. What a mistake. I had the \"Country Combo\" which consisted of biscuits and gravy and potatoes. The potatoes were obviously not fresh as you could taste the freezer burn. The biscuit was actually ok, but the gravy was warm on one side and cold on the other. My wifes skillet on the other hand was just as bad. All of the ingredients were separated. All it was was melted cheese over freezer burned potatoes with a side of scrambled eggs. The staff was not impolite but not overly friendly either. We expected so much more. Sorry to say, we won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Good and not so good. Where to begin? We ordered a full order of the fench toast with peanut butter on top (an additional $1.99) and the Griddle Platter. They also offered a free pancake when checking in on Yelp. The french toast and Griddle Platter were very good. So I give the food 5 stars. The pancake was a bit overcooked and rubbery, but it was free so I won't consider it in our overall rating. The staff was friendly, but most of them are young and don't quite know proper food and beverage ettiquette. When my water was refilled they reached right over my plate to get to my water glass and condensation from the metal water pitcher was dripping all over my french toast. The server later decided to replace the jam condiment caddy that was on our table with a full one. I appreciate wanting us to have more jam, which wasn't needed because the original jam holder was more than half full, but she reached right between the two of us in the middle of our conversation to replace it and didn't say a word. I also had to tell them that they forgot to put peanut butter on my french toast, which they brought out later in a small condiment cup and still charged me for it. Not worth the additonal $1.99.   Overall the food I would give a 4.5-5 rating, friendliness of the staff and cleanliness of the cafe a 4 rating, and customer service know how and restaurant ettiquette a 3 rating. Overall rating a 4, but more like a 3.75 if I could give that as a rating.  The food was good enough to get us to come back again, but the service leaves a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"Worth the wait. The coffee was french press. Excellent service once you got a table. Everything was delicious. We had 5 at our table and all of us were sharing our dishes with each other!"}
{"text":"So, we tried this place the first time when we were waiting for my family member's surgery to get done in the Southernhills Hospital and liked it. The food is good. Clean, small, simple and cozy. Friendly staff. My husband liked it better than Stacks and Yolks because it was not crowded, food is better and cleaner. We will come back!"}
{"text":"I had the Philly griddle. I was happily surprised by the quality of the food : the potatoes were not greasy and overall not too salty. The portion was good. Everything tasted good. Service was perfect, everyone was very attentive. FYI, the entrance is hidden in the corner of the building, look for the big round logo above. And they have wifi."}
{"text":"My hubby & I have been frequenting Griddlecakes, formerly The Griddle, for several years now. We usually stop in a couple Saturday mornings a month and I enjoy a \"build your own\" omelet while my hubby indulges in French toast topped with cinnamon, strawberries & syrup.  The staff is always polite, friendly & accommodating i.e. making sure I have plenty of jalapeno's. Neither of us is very adventurous when it comes to breakfast but lots of their dishes look very tempting.   The atmosphere is comfortable and cozy but sometimes it can get a bit loud with all the happy chatter going on. They also have some outdoor seating as well to enjoy the cooler mornings.  Saturday mornings there is also a car show that takes over part of the parking lot and it's fun to walk around after indulging in a yummy breakfast.   Certainly a local's favorite!"}
{"text":"Awesome!! My new favorite breakfast place in Las Vegas.   I got The Arnold which was great for being an healthy option, and my fiancé got the steak and eggs and she told me the quality of steak rivaled steakhouses we've been to.   Great service as well which really topped off the whole experience.   We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Came for the first time today!  My boy had biscuits and gravy the half order which was really hearty and filling!  It was nicely seasoned and there was a lot of it!  I had the chorizo scramble...YUM!  It had a nice amount of jalapeños and was served with sour cream salsa and a flour tortilla.  Loved the flavor of the dish the potatoes were soft and just a little crispy just how I love them!  Coffee was nice and hot and fresh.  Service was excellent the whole time  .  We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Ok so my first time here I had a horrible experience. It was so bad I couldn't write a review about it. I decided to give them a second chance.........months later. Omgosh!!!!! Soooooooo much better! The food was amazing! The service wasn't bad either. The meat lovers scramble is the devil!!!!!! ROFLMBO!"}
{"text":"We came here based on good reviews and were very disappointed. I ordered the skillet griddle and the potatoes and mushrooms were undercooked. It took too long to get the food out (30 minutes) and we only ordered two entrees. While we waited for the underwhelming food, we weren't crazy about the service either. Besides the fact that no ome greets the front area for patrons coming in, we've witnessed the servers put clean eating utensils on a dirty table, realized the table needed to be cleaned, removed said utensils, wiped the table with questionable-looking dish rag, and then placing the exact same eating utensils back on the \"clean\" table. Griddle cakes definitely need improvement on these areas. On a positive note, their griddlecakes are quite good."}
{"text":"This morning, my wife decided she would take me out to breakfast as one of my birthday gifts. I decided to go to Griddlecakes (GC) on Eastern Ave.  We have eaten breakfast many times at GC, and found the quality of the service and food above average. Their posted hours on Sunday's are from 7am to 3pm. We live less than 2 miles from the Eastern location, so we left the house at 6:40. We arrived at GC at 6:50, parked and approached the front door just in case they were open for coffee for early risers. The temp was 38 degrees, so when we found the front doors locked, not wanting to wait in the cold shade, we returned to our vehicle to wait until 7am. The lights were on and their was a person in the kitchen who clearly saw us. The fact that they were not open early was no big deal. At 7am, an older lady tried to open the front door, but it was still locked. She stood and waited. 7:05 and 7:10 came and went, and GC was still not open. My wife and I decided that 7:15 was our cutoff wait time. At 7:12, the lady waiting at the door approached our truck and told us she eats at GC every Sunday, and they always open on time. She let out a frustrated sigh, and then got in her car and left. We left as well, severely disappointed that one of the now 2 people inside did not have the courtesy to come to the front door and let us know what the problem was, and what time they would be open. While we understand that people call in sick, or arrive for work late, there is no excuse for not letting loyal customers know what's going on.  My wife and I decided that it would be a long time before we try GC again, as there are certainly many other breakfast spots in the area that will value our patronage. We went elsewhere, and had a wonder breakfast anyway."}
{"text":"This is our last stop in Vegas as we head home to Phx.  Griddlecakes has been consistent with their awesome breakfast menu.  We have hit this place when it's super busy and times where we hit it just right to get seated immediately. YELPERS.....check in and you get a free buttermilk pancake!  We came one time and they were experiencing their birthday confetti pancake-SOLD to our at that time 11 year old.  Every time since he has order their birthday pancakes. They are consistent with their buttermilk pancakes, eggs/omelets & french toast.  I will say they do need to work on their breakfast potatoes. The service has always been pretty spot on...so no complaints."}
{"text":"We visited Griddlecakes for brunch and were greeted as soon as we walked through the door, and seated in an open booth.  The place was otherwise full inside and outside, so we must have timed it just right.  Our drink order was taken right away while we perused the breakfast selections and our server was back shortly to take our food order.  I decided on the Short Stack Combo for $8.98.  It included 2 hotcakes, 2 eggs, 2 pieces of bacon, and home fries.  The hotcakes were good; fluffy and light. The bacon was very crispy, as I like it.  The eggs were standard fare.  The potatoes, well, I usually leave home fries or hash browns on my plate, but these were little cubes of deliciousness that were partially crispy and partially soft.  I really enjoyed them.   The BF ordered the Meatlovers Scramble $10.99, which was eggs scrambled with bacon, sausage, ham, homes fries, and cheese.  Served with biscuits & gravy.  The scramble was good, but the biscuit seemed stale and the gravy was pasty instead of tasty.  We would probably visit again, but it would not make the top of our brunch list."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my first trip here.  Food was tasty (I had bacon and eggs) and service was prompt and courteous.  They serve breakfast all day and as someone who likes that for other meals, I was happy.  Good value!"}
{"text":"My new favorite brunch place. Close to my home, cute little place with all the food goodness. Good food selections and best service all around!"}
{"text":"Went Sunday morning for breakfast and was really impresses. I ordered a skillet with ground beef, egg whites and biscuits, gravy. Delicioso, and also added some gluten free pancakes that were icing on the cake. Great local spot, will be back!"}
{"text":"Hi my name is Amanda and I'm a food addict!!  I love trying new places, glad I finally tried Griddlecakes  out.  It is definitely a good breakfast spot. Have had my eye on this place for a bit and saw the review's needed to see for myself. So many good pics of the steak and eggs so that's what I ordered. A fat juicy rib eye is what I got. Asked for medium rare and they cooked it perfectly. The hash browns were cooked nice and crisp,  and over medium eggs! Great menu options; if I could compare it to any other place in would say  its kind of like an Egg & I.  Service was great and the prices a were great as well. They also have a nice patio area that has some shade as well as plenty room inside."}
{"text":"Ordered: eggs Benedict and pancakes Staff: friendly The food tastes okay. It's not bad, but it doesn't stand out either. The portion is too little for the price they charge. I felt like I could cook the food myself and I'm not that good at cooking. There are some places where there's no way you can replicate the cooking of certain Dishes and have it taste as good."}
{"text":"Gave this place a try since it was close by. First off, it's confusing when you walk in because there is no hostess and no one around to greet for at least a few minutes. Pluses were that the decor was nice and it seemed clean.   We ordered our food and that's when the problems started. Food took a while to come out. They seem to be understaffed because there was only one waitress for about 7 tables. The omelette was plain and the potatoes were very underdone. The waitress was very busy so we didn't want to ask for anything else. The pancakes had a good flavor but a little mushy in the middle. The coffee was good.   There is a good variety on the menu but because service is lacking I probably will go else where next time. It's a shame because it's so close to my house."}
{"text":"Our first time in this little family owned gem and all I can say is WOW! Let me start off by saying the customer service is absolutely amazing. They truly care about their customers opinions and they listen to their requests. The food is delicious. I had the protein oatmeal pancakes with fresh strawberries and bananas and It's the first time I have not needed syrup. My gf ordered the country fried steak and eggs and the whole plate was fresh and delicious. The steak was crispy but tender. The potatoes were so flavorful. This is definitely a place you have to try. If you want somewhere that cares about their customers and focuses on the batter not the syrup, then you have to try griddlecakes. Thank you guys for a great first experience!"}
{"text":"Food was good, service was excellent not overbearing but there when I needed anything! Coffee was good, atmosphere and selection was nice. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Love it here! Their pancakes are really good and especially love the fresh orange juice. Marisa gave great service and was very nice... will visit again!"}
{"text":"Favorite part of this place is their potatoes. They are liked cubed and then grilled u Til they get this golden but not burned crust all over and lightly seasoned with salt, pepper, and a hint of garlic. Ordered the skillet with turkey sausage, Red peppers, scrambled eggs, cheese and sourdough toast. Tasty and big portions too. The wait for this place is not fun though. I think we arrived around 10:45am and weren't seated until 11:15am. Not horrible for a Sunday breakfast rush but check out the farmers market in the parking lot while you're waiting. Cool tasty goodies over there for sure that help pass the time. They are a little slow at getting drinks to your table but everyone was friendly and professional. Very small place maybe only about 20 tables total. But I will definitely hit this place up again soon."}
{"text":"Food was bleh, bordering on nasty. And overpriced. The hollandaise sauce on my Eggs Benedict was a weird pukey brown-green color. I just don't understand how someone with any cooking experience at all can mess up hollandaise. It's literally 3 ingredients. But anyways... my sister had a dry chicken sandwich with a piece of chicken that was way too big for a sandwich and hardly any additional condiments or veggies to compensate. Just a big fat hunk of flavorless chicken sandwiched between to smooshed pieces of Texas toast. The pancake was good and fluffy and would have been the only glimmer of hope in this meal if it didn't taste like grilled onions. But the service was excellent. All of the servers were attentive and kind. Unfortunately, we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Had a breakfast date with the hubby. Once again, this place was amazing! Our server Ivan took our order and everything we ordered was on point. He was helpful and congenial! Food was DEE-LISH!!! Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"So I will start this off with the positives. The service was very good.  The staff is very attentive, coffee cup was never without a refill and they are very polite.  My pancakes were another part of the story. Very undercooked and extremely doughy. Hard to tell if the lemon blueberry was a good flavor because you were eating half raw pancakes. Pancakes are my guilty pleasure and for that reason it's highly unlikely I will ever return.  But prices are very reasonable and the egg dishes looked ok. My mom's waffle was ok."}
{"text":"This place needs two separate star ratings. One for food and the the second for service.  FOOD IS 5 STAR  SERVICE IS -0 if that was possible. Every time we eat here the female server is HORRIBLE!!!  For that reason alone, I can only rate 1 star."}
{"text":"Love this place. Come here every week and never had one complain. The food is delicious. Service is outstanding."}
{"text":"Totally a fan. After reading reviews I was sketchy but I am a big food critic and this was amazing. Best breakfast joint in town. Seasoned really good those chefs know what they are doing. Nick and Jaime we're amazing . Couldn't even wait for a photo it was so good."}
{"text":"I had breakfast/lunch here twice now.  I think it's best to sit next to a window just to feel that brunch vibe and to get some of that Vegas sunlight in.  The service was friendly, I think Ryan was the name of my server.  There were 8 tables occupied including myself and the server did his best to stay on top of them.  Of course the regulars got special attention.    There was a hostess/bus person, the server, and manager/food runner.  When I got my skillet I never saw anyone again until it was time to get my check.  A refill on my water would have been nice.  Overall I can find myself being a regular here too, definitely give it a try.  And I have to agree with the server about the H&K being one nice piece of weapon."}
{"text":"I went for the first time today and was extremely disappointed with both the service and the food. We ordered two different skillets and both were served at room temperature with the potatoes being hard as if they were burned when being cooked. Some of the pieces we couldn't even bite through... On one of the skillets the ABC there was supposed to be avocado which was not served with it, we asked for it later. I decided to bring up that the potatoes were burnt/crispy and they said oh yeah sorry they're not supposed to be that crispy... yeah i hope not because no one would order your potatoes! Finally they gave us 20% off of our check to compensate (wasn't necessary just would've liked better service in this experience) but they gave this to us on a Tuesday. Griddlecakes does 20% off of their menu on tuesdays regardless. Not a good first time experience, don't recommend it!  And looking at other customers photos it's frustrating seeing that the food could've been great & we were not able to have that experience. Instead we got burnt/day old potatoes."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!! the food was GREAT! The people were extremely friendly & efficient & service was top notch! The Griddle Tosada special should be on the menu!  If visiting LV get off the strip & try this place!!!"}
{"text":"Wow I really enjoyed this place. We came here on a whim this morning when Rise n Shine once again had too long of a wait. Griddlecakes was able to seat us immediately.  I ordered the Eggs Benedict Florentine and my boyfriend had the Philly Skillet with a side of biscuit and gravy. This was one of the best Eggs Benedict I've ever had. EVER! I can't get over how good it was. The eggs were cooked so perfectly and the hollandaise was on point. The flavors were incredible. The side of potatoes was yummy as well. I highly recommend this dish. My boyfriend said he'd give his food 3 stars because it was a bit too starchy and he'd like it if the components were more balanced. He said his biscuit and gravy was also averagely good.   Additionally the staff is quick, attentive, and very nice. This place is great for vegetarians and gluten-free diners as well. Don't come here if you're vegan, you won't find much to eat. The only downside for me was that my coffee was only moderately warm. If I get some piping hot coffee and a happier boyfriend on next visit, I'll give this place 5 stars."}
{"text":"Good for breakfast or brunch. They open at 7 am ! It's hard to find restaurant open the early around this area. All the time I got happy stuff   1 time they forgot to give me orange juice. But it's happened no one perfect!"}
{"text":"this place is drat disgusting. do not, i repeat, do not eat here! unless you want to vomit! The Griddle? More like, The Shittle!"}
{"text":"I had heard that The Griddle had amazing Red Velvet Pancakes so I was very excited to try them and compare them to my favorite ones at Babystacks Cafe.   We walked in mid-morning on a Sunday and the place was very empty with only 4 parties seated in the large space. That should've been a warning sign, but as we were starving  .. we decided to stay and give it a try.   I opted for the Red Velvet Pancakes and my dining partner got the Waffle. My pancakes came out and looked ok. But the taste was not there. They were soggy and mushy, and didn't taste like Red Velvet at all. And to make it worse, they decided to top it off with some Raspberry syrup. YUCK! I ate about 1/4 of the order and just couldn't eat any more. Anyone who knows me knows that it must have been pretty bad as I love pretty much Red Velvet anything and hate to waste food.   My friend said the Waffle was okay, nicely done, but it was \"nothing to write home about.\" Our server was prompt and friendly but didn't really check back to see how we liked our food or if we needed anything else.   They offer a nice menu and the prices are fair, but with so many other great breakfast venues in the area, I will definitely not be back."}
{"text":"Me and my husband wanted to try this place and finally gave in hoping that it'll satisfy our cravings for some good redvelvet pancakes.  I'm sorry to say but we're really disappointed it was chewy, not fluffy. It could've been better.. Maybe? If there's syrup on the side."}
{"text":"This spot is right around the corner from home. The coffee is good and the food is really awesome. The prices are reasonable and the service is . The pancakes are huge and fluffy"}
{"text":"We went in on a Sunday morning, it was very busy but we got seated in about 10 minutes. Service and food were both excellent! I ordered and omelette that was cooked perfectly with potatoes and toast. Very large portions but made excellent leftovers. The lemon blueberry pancakes and French toast ordered by my family smelled heavenly as well! All around great place, kind if small so would be difficult for a large party, but I will definitely be heading back!"}
{"text":"1st - I know this is the location near my house but I think this is the wrong address attached to this location - it's still should be a  Las Vegas (not Henderson) address as is the other places in this shopping center.....  Anyways - inside is clean but service is slow and not very informative - when I ordered the side of 2 pancakes knowing it was our first time eating there the waitress should have told us that 1 pancake is already pretty huge - that info would've been nice!!!  The food took awhile and when it came it wasn't hot -  The food was OK - it's nothing special - the crab cake eggs benedict was a tad bit too fishy and the hollandiase sauce had no flavor - it was the same with the BF's biscuit covered in white gravy - the gravy was tasteless.....  The Red Velvet pancake with chocolate chips and cream cheese syrup was OK as well....I wouldn't order that again and if I did only 1 pancake is needed as a side and to share. The kid's chicken tenders and fries were good enough for her -  The BF's breakfast skillet was OK - but he didn't care to finish it which is unusual.... Maybe we ordered the wrong stuff - IDK - all I know is that if a place makes me wait longer than the normal time my food better be hot and a little salt added to the food does go a long way....."}
{"text":"The service was amazing! We were welcomed and kindly treated throughout the visit. We really wanted to like this place because it's close to home and we love breakfast. But to put it plainly, we were underwhelmed. Sigh. The biscuits didn't have homemade gravy. It was powdery. The pancakes are big and pretty, but the taste was plain. There just wasn't anything exciting about it. The price was fair, but we just weren't happy with our food."}
{"text":"When it comes to Mollie's I am perplexed.  It is like a most other country cafes in that is is homey with big portions at a not so big price.  Part of what confuses me is with use of the letter \"K\" in the name.  What is the purpose of that?  Whimmsey?  Whatever.  At least it is not named after a Karen.  That would make for an awkward set of initials.  Anyhow, second point of confusion, the decor.  There was a patchwork of table, chairs, and booths.  All looked as though they came from several other restaurants.  The chair I was in looked familiar.  My thought was L&L Hawaiin BBQ.  The table was reminiscent of Aloha Kitchen.  Some chairs looked like bamboo and had arm rests.  Other chairs did not.  Did the owners go to some surplus sale and buy what they could?  I don't know.  More important than the atmosphere is the food.  I got a lot of food for $9.99.  A Philly Skillet consisting of home fries topped with chopped beef steak, onion, bell pepper, three scrambled eggs and cheddar cheese.  On the side was two biscuits with gravy.  I was full when I left.  Satisfied though?  Eh.  The potatoes were oviously boiled before they were placed on the griddle.  Home fries are supposed to be browned and somewhat crunchy.  Not soggy.  The steak had a great flavor.  No complaints there.  The menu stated mushrooms were included in this dish.  There were no mushrooms.  Additionally, bell peppers were not mentioned yet had a supporting role.  This was acceptable but I really do like mushrooms.  So Mollie's gets docked points there.  As for the biscuits and gravy.  I've had better.  Heck, I've made better.  The biscuits were small and lacked the fluff I like in a good biscuit.  The gravy had no sausage as a good country gravy should.  It was more of a warm paste seasoned heavily with black pepper.  I hate to say it because I like to support little one-off places like this, but I prefer to go to Denny's for breakfast.  The service was good and quick.  I have to give them that."}
{"text":"Love to eat here on the patio with our dogs!  The food is really good and reasonable too.  I'm pretty sure this is a family owned and operated business.  Everyone who works here is very nice and friendly.    I'd suggest breakfast with the chicken, feta, spinach and potatoes.  It comes with pita slices.  Very delicious!  My husband has always enjoyed their Griddle breakfast of eggs, hash browns, toast and sausage.    This is an easy to get to location.  Go on Saturday mornings....there's normally a car show.  Very fun to walk around!"}
{"text":"We had an hour for lunch and decided to try Griddlecakes. Upon arriving, you seat yourself and grab a menu off the side table. We grabbed a booth by the door and looked over the menu, which is only breakfast and lunch.  Since it was noon-ish, we picked lunch fare. A grilled chicken sandwich (plus avocado, of course) with a side salad. It was good, pretty basic, but that's what I ordered. My lunch mate ordered a hamburger and fries. The fries were delish, but the burger was super oily, so much so she couldn't eat more than a bite.  Service was good, they were friendly and pretty attentive.  Total for 2 meals, a Coke and iced tea, $27 and  change.  I might try them for breakfast one day."}
{"text":"Second time here.... The food is Great!!! Portions are plentiful!!!! Price point is right on..  Moe importantly, the service is off the charts.  Every employee is wearing a smile!!!  Good on you guys, keep up the great job!!"}
{"text":"Crab cake Benedict and the breakfast sandwich on a croissant. Both are awesome. I really liked the homestyle fries. Service was great food was quick."}
{"text":"Yikes! This might just be one of the worst tasting breakfasts I've ever had.  I came in 2 weeks ago with a friend who recommended this place and the food was just bad all the way around.  I ordered a 2 egg breakfast and the scrambled eggs were super bland and over cooked. And by over cooked I mean hard and they did not taste good. The potatoes were also super bland and they tasted more like mashed potatoes.  Altogether this meal was a huge disappointment and a waste of money and time. I personally would not recommend this breakfast place, but if you like bland food then be my guest."}
{"text":"The Griddle actually has pretty good food - the reason for the 1 star is in everything else that goes into a restaurant... after waiting 20 minutes we were seated at a barely cleaned table with more food on the floor than got into the last guests mouth.  The only thing prompt about our service was the person who took our drink order.  After that we had to ASK for someone to take our order.  We had to continually ASK for drink refills/cream, etc.  It took about 30 minutes for our food to come to the table.  We were NOT checked on while eating.  We waited another 10-12 minutes after we finished eating until we had to ASK for our check (keep in mind every \"ask\" is us hunting someone down and/or trying to make eye contact with someone to come over to us).  They took our card and after waiting another 10 minutes we finally had to go up to the bar to retrieve our card and complete our purchase.  Even after all of this I would have given it another try until my conversation with the manager.  I told him that the food is great, but if I can give some constructive criticism it would be to hire more help - the food took forever & the wait staff, although friendly enough, could in NO WAY handle the demands of the restaurant.  To which his reply was, \"Everyone knows how to run a restaurant!\"  I not only find this extremely rude and not customer friendly, it's also repulsive.  Never once did I tell him HOW to run his restaurant, I was simply making a recommendation trying to HELP him retain customers.  He really needs a lesson in customer service & THIS reason alone is why I will not return to the Griddle."}
{"text":"Amazing service and foods. Our server Hamed was the best! I had there blueberry pancakes and they literally tasted like muffins lol"}
{"text":"The seats are so damn uncomfortable.  I wish that restaurants would avoid that style chair. They have this long booth and huge tables which makes seating awkward. Apparently it's so a party of 4 can sit.  Now the food is good and huge portion. Bland. Pancakes huge but dry. I feel like the waitress should have been a little proactive by letting us know of the portions, but understandably so the upsell is obvious.   I ordered the strawberry pancakes and got a small order of strawberries w/the order of these huge pancakes with no butter. I felt at some point that I had to ask for butter, for a plate, for more coffee so that I can maneuver eating breakfast. The waitress not so great, nice, but ditsy.   I can say this will be a 1st and last for me..."}
{"text":"Honestly, we had the most amazing experience here. First off, our waitress was so sweet and helpful. We had the garden scramble, monkey business signature short stack pancakes and with our yelp check in we got a free lemon blueberry pancake. Everything was super yummy. We often eat out for brunch so we can be a bit particular and griddle cakes quickly became one of our neighborhood favorites. I totally recommend this cute little restaurant :)"}
{"text":"A nice local eatery that does breakfast pretty well - not to die for, but if you want a sit down breakfast without having to stand in line, this is a good spot!  Coffee is hot and continuous, their menu isn't overwhelming, but is adequate.  I usually order up an omelet with some veggies which comes with toast and potatoes. Never disappointed!  We've also had their skillets (which are huge!) and breakfast burrito (there are many other places I'd recommend for better burritos!).    Very kid friendly - my girls get the happy face pancakes which is quite a bit of p'cakes or the eggs, potatos and toast (for my anti-meat unless its a McDonalds cheeseburger child)  -always goes over well!   Service is usually timely, nothing quick, but very ordinary.  The atmosphere is nice - wide open decorated space.  You don't come out with the sensory overload or greasy bacon smell lingering in your hair either.  That's always a bonus! :)  Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Decided to go try on  I guess I should have tried it before I invited my pastor and his kids the food was not good the service was ok and the prices are too high for the food that you get and breakfast for us was like $45 for 3 adults and 3 children"}
{"text":"Happened onto this place while renting a car for a day of travel.... What a great find, portions are huge, food was excellent, prices were more then reasonable. Looking for a great affordable place for breakfast here it is"}
{"text":"YES 5!  I've been coming to this place since they've opened. Since then, I've tried pretty much everything, almost everything. Although they did change their name to \"The Griddle Cake\" thankfully it's the same owners and menu. They serve breakfast and lunch.   It's a small little restaurant that doesn't seat many, which is why it's always busy because it's really yummy! The atmosphere is just plain comfortable. You'll be happy and cozy.   Yesterday was New Years Day and also was our anniversary, so we decided to have our first meal of 2014 at this place! We walked in, there was a bit of a wait, but not too bad. Then ordered with our waiter, who's always on point every time we get him. Hubby got the Philly Cheese steak Skillet, which is mixed with the obvious the steak, lots of gooey cheese, veggies, home potato fries  and 3 eggs, he had them cook 2 scrambled and 1 sunny side up to top it on the steak skillet, oh and it also came with a huge side of Biscuits and gravey.  All the skillets come in large portions for an affordable amount which was around $10 or so.   I had a build your own omelette and I got an egg, cheese, sausage, tomato, mushrooms and green pepper omelette. Which came with home fries and your choice of toast again with an generous portion for about $9.00 or so. This omelette is fluffy and so flavorful. I love it.   And last but certainly not least. We had to get the short stack (should've gotten full) of The BEST red velvet pancakes!!! With Strawberries!!! These red velvet pancakes are the most buttery, soft, moist, fluffiest pancakes ever! They just melt in your mouth. They include chocolate chips in the batter and swirl chocolate syrup and powered sugar on top and sprinkle the sweet sliced strawberries on top with cream cheese frosting on the side. OMG my mouth is watering just typing this. Lol this place is a MUST!"}
{"text":"To make me come on Yelp to review says a lot -- the place can either be out of my mind amazing or so bad that I needed the world to know. Unfortunately, this place fell in the latter category. The service was lackluster, bordering on dismal. The food was average, nothing to call home about. I had the french toast, soggy like my mood. But the reason as to why I graced my presence on Yelp was because they overcharged my bill by 10 dollars and if I didn't catch it, they wouldn't have said anything. After confrontation, they did not apologize and just handed the check back to me with little more than an oops. I didn't expect anything, just a \"sorry\" would've sufficed. But their sour moods coupled with their sour foods just really meant no one should waste their time there."}
{"text":"Honestly, not impressed. They're ridiculously packed (there needs to be more brunch places) and extremely loud. I could deal with that, though, if the food and service were worth it. The wait is long to get a table, and once we did, we sat without menus or drinks for ten minutes. When we flagged someone down to get menus, we also had to get someone else to bring utensils. The prices are stupid- plain and simple. A pancake and eggs shouldn't cost that much. Be prepared for $60+ for four people. The food also didn't come out for 20 minutes after we ordered. And we didn't order lobster, just basic breakfast. Not really blown away and most likely won't come back."}
{"text":"Food was great! Service when we wakes in amazing a man I'm assuming the owner helped seat us right away. Waitress took our order right away & the food was up on the window ready quick.  This is where service started to change. When I seen the food sitting in the window I looked for our waitress she was walking towards it then stopped & sat down to take a women's order & chat a little. The male waiter then brought us our food. Last no refills on drinks but the male waiter had made a couple rounds to all of his tables but not our waitress. She just seemed a little out of it today. We were in a hurry so when she didn't come by with a check after we were done I had to walk up to the register. Not huge issues just would've been nice to have a more attentive waitress"}
{"text":"Stopped in this morning for a late breakfast. We were really impressed with all of the wonderful choices on the menu. We shared the Gobbler skillet with a side of biscuits and gravy. It was 3 eggs, turkey sausage, peppers, onions, spinach and cheese on top of breakfast potatoes with a side of biscuits and gravy. I substituted the turkey sausage for pork which made it so much better, in my humble opinion. The biscuits and gravy were very good. Light biscuit and perfect sausage gravy.  The portions were ample enough to share and take a bit home.  Substitutions are not a problem. They are very accommodating seemed more than willing to customize to individual taste. I definitely want to go back and try the griddlecakes, the ladies at the table next to us had the original and pb and banana. They looked wonderful and the ladies eating them were euphoric. The ladies that waited on us were very sweet and attentive. Quick to keep the coffee and tea cups full. Warm greetings when we entered and thanked us as we exited. I am anxious to try the location closer to home. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I came in around 1pm. I have Chicken & Waffle. Yes, One waffle lol. Anyways, It was great! The chicken was cooked well, and golden brown. The waffles were fluffy with the right amount of crisp. Hint of vanilla. Great tasting Maple syrup.   My date had ordered the Strawberry, Banana, and Almond, oatmeal, and granola. Fresh fruit, crunchy granola, and well cooked oatmeal. Great taste.  The customer service was decent. Not bad in anyway, but I say decent because not much was needed. Quick order, drop off, then checkout. Simple process, minimal interaction/interruption with the waitress. 100% recommended to anyone and everyone."}
{"text":"Just had a yummy gluten free waffle with strawberries and bananas. My fiancé had their chorizo scramble. The food was delicious and served in a timely manner. The waiter was very friendly and helpful. I definitely recommend this little breakfast joint!"}
{"text":"Thought this place was just average. The food was pretty tasty and fresh - I got an omelet with veggies and my friend got some plain pancakes. It just lacked a little bit of flavor that I have found at other breakfast/brunch joints! Would try it again though and maybe order something different off of their menu."}
{"text":"I love country fried potatoes and Griddlecakes did not disappoint!  Everything my fiancée and I ordered was delicious. I recall ordering the french toast breakfast with country fried potatoes and eggs. My fiancé ordered the enormous Peanut Butter pancakes and they were, so big that he couldn't even finish them all.   When I first entered Griddlecakes, I was amazed at how packed it was, but after ordering and trying my first bite, I understood why. The service was nice and moderate and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"Such a cute little breakfast place! One of the best red velvet pancakes I've ever had! Their skillets are amazing as well."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed. Maybe it's because I ordered to go? I ordered my usual corned beef hash and I was excited because I know that it isn't corned beef from the can. My husband brought it home and one look at it and you could tell the corned beef was so dry. It was beef jerky style. Already bummed that my $20 breakfast was a dud! The potatoes were good though so I'll give them a star for that. Another star for the portion size of my eggs (3 over easy eggs cooked over hard but that may be a to go issue) and the size of the red velvet. I asked my husband to order me a small stack of red velvet and I ended up with 2 humongous pancakes. Is that the short stack? I'm not sure. So portion sizing is great but the pancakes were just ehhhh. The cakes were so dense and hard to eat and there was chocolate syrup? all over the top which I didn't really like...maybe I just like my pancakes fluffy and light. Overall I wasn't impressed by the food except for the potatoes. I'll give it another chance one of these days though since it's so close to home."}
{"text":"Very small space so I imagine it can get crowded quickly.   And it could probably be quite noisy too.  But we must have had first-timer's luck b/c we came on a Sunday around 1130 and had no wait at all (yay!)  Super personable, friendly & attentive staff.  The owner stopped by several times.    It's not foo-foo, fancy breakfast/brunch.    So if you don't care about the hype of being seen in the latest brunch joint w/ a DJ at brunch, you'll get an enjoyable meal of good food here.   The food was good to great.   Had the birthday pancake (my least favorite.. pancake was a little less hearty/thick than I like but I ate it & enjoyed it), bacon (YUM!!!! 'Nuff said), biscuits & gravy (biscuit was fluffy, gravy was good+ but not overly flavorful) and the Philly skillet w/ 2 poached eggs (the \"steak\" was like steak 'um meat so not 5-fantastic, but good & the poached eggs were near perfect).  I ate everything (or at least some of everything) & enjoyed it so will be back.    Yes, I over-ordered!!!  Portions are large.  But I wanted to take leftovers home to hubs who didn't get invited to brunch w/ the girls.   Only thing that would make this place a 5 is mimosas.  Hopefully they're working on that."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Came here to Vegas on vacation with my family and on the way to the Hoover dam we stopped here for some breakfast. Very good food and great service! Really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"The pancakes are large and you receive large portions. The meals are very reasonably price. Everything was delicious!!"}
{"text":"God awful food! The corned beef hash was not hash at all. It was sliced corned beef then chopped and fried. It was like jerky, but without any seasoning. The potatoes were tasteless. The only thing edible was the toast and that was only because I was starving! They should just go to Costco and buy the canned corned beef. That would've been 10 times better than the deli meat that used."}
{"text":"I was very impressed from the moment I entered. We had Frank as our server and his attention to detail was exactly what you hope for going into a restaurant. My 3 year old son dropped a fork and not even seconds later a new fork arrived without having to ask. The service was quick and friendly. Food was great. My picky-eating kids ate every bite. I will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"Love the deep-fried French toast and all their skillets,  you need to get there early because it gets packed very fast the food is fresh and taste awesome"}
{"text":"I have had breakfast here a couple times now. It's always busy weekend mornings, the customer service is always very good, however their food isn't all that impressionable. My oatmeal was missing some of the ingredients that it was supposed to have and their skillet ingredients aren't fresh.  You're better off going home and making the stuff yourself."}
{"text":"Tried to eat Breakfast today. When I went in, I was not greeted and since it was my first visit, I wandered on in. I walked around several tables back to what seemed to be the main counter.  Still no one said anything to me. I went to the rest room and returned to the dining area. Still no one said anything even though several employees walked past me. I ended up leaving without eating or even been acknowledged. Maybe I was invisible today."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast today and Ivan was our server. He was awesome and so was the food!! I highly recommend the Mediterranean Wrap."}
{"text":"Country feel with good old fashion eats...ding!  Traveling with my two daughters to the Hoover dam and it was fantastic!"}
{"text":"We've heard so much good and bad about Giddlecakes, we had to stop by and see for ourselves. We were greeted and seated as soon as we walked in...and had coffee at our table almost as fast. Our server(s), I think every employee on the floor came by our table at least 2x...and they were friendly, cheerful & our coffee cups were never empty. (Bonus in my book)  My wife had the chicken and waffles, which was great tasting. The chicken was cooked perfectly and there was no \"grease\" oozing all over the waffle.   I had the Lumber Jack. Another great choice! The eggs were cooked perfectly, the bacon was meaty, hardly any fat, and the pancakes were huge.  We will be back again"}
{"text":"Not bad for a little Hole in the wall breakfast diner! I had the pancakes which by the way are huge, fluffy, and delicious. Turkey sausage had good flavor. The home Fries are decent. And the scrambled eggs were made just right.   Good service by the waitress. I would recommend this place to any person wanting breakfast."}
{"text":"Located in the Richmar Plaza in Henderson. This breakfast and lunch place has some interesting breakfast concoctions i.e. The Philly Skillet, the only issue was some sort of average and uninspired service, and that's being kind. On the bright side there is a Yelp! check-in offer of a free pancake. So in short good food, ok service. Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!"}
{"text":"I just happened to be in this shopping center for another appointment, and I had time for breakfast. Instead of opting for an Einstein Bagel I decided to give Griddlecakes a try. It turns out to be a serious error in judgment, as this could very well be the worst breakfast that I have ever had.  I'm a fan of good corned beef hash, and I would expect that in this day and age, restaurants would be making it from scratch especially a restaurant specializing in breakfast.  This would not be the case, it came straight out of a can, and not opened today either as was apparent from the grey color. To make matters worse, even the poached eggs ordered with it were cooked hard. Oh, I forgot to mention the brunt outside, raw inside home fries and the cold toast.  We are in serious need of a great breakfast house in this area, Griddlecakes is not it."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch one Saturday approx 12:45pm. The parking lot, as usual, was completely packed in the busy shopping center. We seated ourselves in a side booth and our drink order was taken shortly after. The place was full of diners and as soon as a table would leave, more patrons would arrive. Their outside tables filled quickly too. My Mom and I had the Veggie burger sandwich and Chicken Breast Pesto Sandwich - both were served fast, hot and delicious. Side salad I had with italian dressing was a large portion for being a side, and rich with baby greens. The cup of Cream of Potato soup my Mom had (she is not a \"cream\" soup eater, but gave it a shot) was hearty and flavorful, she really enjoyed it. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My breakfast experience here was A-OK. The inside of the restaurant is fairly tiny with additional seating on the sidewalk. Like most breakfast spots in town they get busy on the weekend mornings. We arrived before 9 a.m. and snagged one of the last tables.  Even though the name is Griddlecakes they offer much more. They also offer benedicts, skillets, and other egg and meat options. If pancakes are your thing then this restaurant will offer all of the options you are seeking.  My breakfast was the Crab Benedict with Home Fries. The benedict was made with seasoned crab cakes. The benedict was okay, but the home fries were not very flavorful. My husband had The Big Nevadan Skillet. He loved it and the Sausage Gravy and Biscuits on the side. His meal was a very large portion. We also used the Yelp check-in offer for a free buttermilk pancake. I really liked the pancake and will definitely get pancakes next time I come in.  The service was efficient during our visit. Our orders were taken quickly and delivered quickly. A waitress other than ours peeked in to make sure our orders had been taken and again after we had food she checked to see if we needed anything else. I like when restaurants work in a team so that no needs are overlooked."}
{"text":"The owner and I have been friend's for years, and I was really excited when he opened up his first restaurant. Hamed always spoke about his passion when it came to cooking and wanting to care of people. He was very passionate about his idea, years before it opened. Now I'm a regular. I always bring new and out of town friend's to enjoy his handcrafted menu. The service is fast, friendly and you can't beat the price. See yah Sunday!!"}
{"text":"I heard about this place through coworkers and so I checked it out on Yelp, reviews seemed great... We were disappointed.  However, the service was fine. Staff was attentive and friendly. The place was clean and the style fun. The food was the problem.  We ordered a plain waffle with eggs and bacon and the traditional Benny. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't good. Nothing special, nothing memorable. We didn't get the \"special\" pancakes, so maybe that's where we went wrong.  Unfortunately, we don't plan on coming back."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised with Griddlecakes.  Met with a friend with the intention of going to Baby Stakes Cafe, but there was a long wait.  Looked on yelp and saw Griddle Cakes had great reviews for a breakfast lunch eatery - and just down the street on Fort Apache.     Looks like a new place, medium size restaurant.  Great customer service, the staff was pleasant and friendly.  It was slightly busy, but not much of a wait.  Many choices for breakfast foods and lunch - I would recommend it to my friends as a great breakfast place.  I will have to go back there for lunch.  Had a bacon and swiss cheese omelette with grilled potatoes - with a single plain pancake.  Although I just went traditional - the food was delicious.  You have to see the menu - they allow you to build your own omelette or pancake combination.  They also have signature dishes which I will have to try next time.  This place will be on my list of recommended eateries for sure."}
{"text":"Love this place. Used to come here with my dad and now I've brought all my friends. This is our go to spot for breakfast spot. Pancakes are da bomb here and so are the griddles. I don't know why they have three and a half stars. Foods bomb and decently priced and everyone that works here has been helpful. They also have outside chairs which are nice. I recommend this place over stacks and yolks. Lol just saying I know everyone is shitting bricks over that place and it's cool but I prefer the griddle cakes."}
{"text":"Try the griddle skillets. Service was great!"}
{"text":"We didn't have a wait to get in on a Sunday afternoon and it was pretty busy.  The staff was pretty nice.  This was our first visit and we were surprised, the menu doesn't just have breakfast items, there are also salads and sandwiches.  Our food was a step up from something you would get at Denny's, which is really not saying much.  My waffle was pretty good, but the eggs and chicken had to come home and were fed to my dogs later, they were just inedible (the eggs were dry and the chicken was sweet).  My husband had an omelet, which was okay.  Overall, our bill was $42 with tax and tip, which is just ridiculous for breakfast."}
{"text":"This place is DELICIOUS! The service could use some work, but for how great the food is, I can deal with it. Our server checked on us a few times, but the first time in, it took a while to be acknowledged by the staff. But overall,  their pancakes are to die for. I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I've been visiting Griddlecake locations for a few years and  the customer service, quality and quantity of food has always exceeded my expectations. This location is the closest to my home and the service is on par with all the other locations, always a warm inviting environment. My favorite dish to order is the Hobo Skillet. Always satisfying, and the home fries are amazing."}
{"text":"Yummy! Great place similar to Egg Works. Much less crowded and simple. I will definitely be visiting once again. When visiting be sure to get a booth....much more comfortable than the rock hard chairs on the four top tables."}
{"text":"This review would have been a 3, if I hadn't seen a little bug like creature scamper across our table at the end of our meal.  Although the food was good, I had the red velvet pancakes, and added over-easy eggs and sausage -- I can't get over seeing that bug! And it was *on the table*. It makes me wonder where else bugs are hanging out in this place. I understand, bugs be bugs and they get into places, especially places that have food, etc.... but still, I just can't shake it, so I won't be back here.  I also was not a fan of the park-bench seating in the booth my husband and I were sat at.  Feel like the place could use a slight renovation (but keep the old charm), even just change out the tables. Nothing major. Also, keep up on the bug spray... or something. I don't know, but please just keep the little critters out of there."}
{"text":"I love be this place!  I go every morning I am in town and the food is always great.  I prefer coming here over Stacks and Yolks being the service is much better."}
{"text":"Went with my daughter a couple of weeks ago. There was a 20 minute wait, which is completely understandable for a Sunday morning. Everyone who worked there was super friendly and attentive. The issue I had, actually my 13-year-old had was she saw our breakfast coming out of a microwave. I told my daughter that perhaps it was a place to keep it warm while waiting on the other plates, but sure enough, it was a microwave. Eggs, bacon and toast came out lukewarm but pancakes were really good."}
{"text":"Small breakfast/lunch spot located off of Eastern in Henderson. Griddlecakes offers inside and outside seating, the booths go fast! The tables in the middle of the restaurant are a bit small and you feel a little packed in if its a full house. On weekends there is usually a wait up to 20 minutes. Staff is very friendly but it did take about 10 minutes after being seated to be greeted. The food has always been great in my opinion (and very reasonably priced). I always order the tuna melt- one of the best I've had! My husband usually makes his own omelette and staff was accommodating at subbing potatoes or toast for oatmeal (most breakfasts spots do not for some odd reason). This is one of my go-to restaurants on the weekends, great gem in Henderson!   Hours: 7:00am-3:00pm"}
{"text":"Best breakfast place ever, can't beat the skillets w/ biscuits and gravy, French toast. Pancakes, waffles, all delish. Place can get busy, servers try their best, but refills can become scarce.  But staff is always nice."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for a good breakfast and couldn't wait to check out what they had on the menu. I don't see a lot of places that offer chicken and waffles so when I spotted that I knew I had to try it! When it came out it wasn't what I was expecting. The waffle was beautiful it  kind of looked like a flower but the piece of chicken was disappointing. I was thinking the chicken would be like a drumstick not a chicken strip. It wasn't about the quantity ...I just think that they taste different. I would have rather had chicken that had bones in it. It would give it more of a \"down home type of appeal\". The waffle was fresh and I could tell that is wasn't frozen because it was crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.  I thought the restaurant's decor could have been brighter. If you are going for mustard yellow why not go a step above and make it sunshine yellow!  I just think a brighter yellow would remind me more of breakfast . What can I say I love bright colors!   The service was fine. The food came out in a timely manner and we didn't have to hunt down a waitress for refills. I just thought my entree could have been better ."}
{"text":"\"Molly's\"   ...yes, \"Molly's\" is what this great restaurant was named for almost 23 years in the same location on the corner of Jones and Cheyenne in Las Vegas, NV My wife and I have been here many times over the years and I confess I haven't had much in the way of lunch items here. Why you ask? It's because their breakfast entree's are the best you will get anywhere on planet earth! We make a point of coming here for that! This very morning (Sunday 9/7/2014) my wife had the garden skillet and I had my usual \"Lumberjack\" with 2 eggs, bacon, their unbeatable \"home fried taters\" along with 2 giant fluffy \"melt-in-yer-mouth\" pancakes topped with great tasting coffee. Oh man! There's simply no doubt that we had the best breakfast you'll find anywhere...even home cooking does not get better than this. Speaking of \"home\", this place is very homey feeling. Folks of all ages will be very comfortable here. Griddlecakes' specialty of course is their breakfast selections., I mean with a name like Griddlecakes you can expect that. But their lunch entree's are also exceptional. My pick is the breakfast menu only because I personally prefer breakfast. It's my all-time favorite food choice. My wife actually agrees with me on this one!  So if its the best homemade style breakfast you'll ever want for, this establishment is an absolute must. The prices?....very affordable for all budgets. This is a great place for families too, A new name....same owners.....same great food as always!"}
{"text":"Griddlecakes was a pleasant surprise regarding the flavor of the food.  We ordered the Griddle Skillet and the Chicken wings and waffles. The Griddle skillet was so good and the feta set it off! Very filling. My husband had the Waffles and wings, it came with four wings. He was full after eating all the food to it's  entirety.   The decor is dated and does not flow. The theme was country inn and could be updated.  The only issue we had was the ceiling fan overhead was dusty."}
{"text":"Cool spot to grab some breakfast, quality food and nice staff."}
{"text":"The food is great! Best chicken fried steak! The service is fast and excellent, very accommodating. Everyone including wait staff and bussers are checking on you. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I came to eat breakfast here the other day. I've been here once before and I remember it being good which is why I returned again. However, this time was different because we get seated and we were told that our server will be right with us, we waited about 10 minutes before someone actually took our order. It wasn't a big deal because I noticed she was the only server so I was like okay, that's fine.  The busser was not on it. I was a before server too, and my number 1 rule was to ALWAYS keep my customers drinks full. I drank all of my water and I was not finished with my meal. He would come by and take plates from our table, but he wouldn't refill my drink for some reason. I even placed my empty cup at the end of the table as a sign to PLEASE REFILL. And instead, he came by asking if we wanted boxes. Uh no, but I'd like a refill :)   4 stars for the food, -1 because the service is uhhhh."}
{"text":"Stopped by here based on Yelp reviews. I ordered Peanut butter pancakes combo and side of biscuit and gravy. Pancakes are huge. I would like a little more peanut butter flavor but they were good. Biscuits are great and huge, gravy was a little bland but some pepper and Tabasco livened it up. Eggs were cooked perfectly and bacon was excellent.  Customer service was excellent, it's nice to still see great customer service. The pricing is right especially for the portion size your receiving.  Overall had a great experience and will be dining here again."}
{"text":"Cool little place, maybe 20-25 tables, with a nice bright decor and cheery feel. Almost felt like some of the main street cafes from the beach towns of Southern California.  The entryway situation was a little strange in that when you walk in you are staring right at a 2 person high-top table eating their breakfast and no host stand. Luckily, one of the servers quickly made eye contact and asked \"how many?\"  It could have been a little awkward if they were all busy and didn't see us for a few minutes. At the same time, there were no tables available and they did just fine. We waited for about 5 minutes and were seated.  Nice selection on the menu and the \"Build Your Own Omelet\" for $7.99 caught my eye right away. You get to pick 3 things to put in it for that price too, with a $.75 up charge for additional items...reasonable and to be expected especially when they give you three.   I opted for tomatoes, mushrooms, spinach, turkey sausage. It came with breakfast potatoes that were very good (not all fried and greasy) and a buttermilk biscuit that was about average. Add a coffee to the mix and you have the makings of a delicious Saturday morning breakfast.   I will visit again for sure."}
{"text":"Woke up today and wanted to try something different do we came to griddlecakes! I ordered the lemon blueberry short stack and my boyfriend had the red velvet short stack. They were delicious! Nice to have something different besides boring plain pancakes. We Also made them both a combo adding eggs and sausage or bacon. Next time I come back I am trying the chicken and waffles! Great place"}
{"text":"Was in the area and found this little place.  We loved the food.  They make pancakes to order with different batters and toppings.  Also have eggs and all the sides to go with yours pancakes.  We met the owners while we were there.  There was a little delay with our food and after we paid the bill he gave us a gift certificate to use on our next visit.  Worth the trip if you are staying in Vegas."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in town hands down. Affordable prices and the food is delicious. They have the best hash browns ever. And I'm picky when it comes to hash browns. The service is really good and fast. They got bought out by new owners, so all those negative reviews about service being terrible is confusing to me because their service is fast. And Most importantly attentive. We'll continue to go here."}
{"text":"Had the crab cake benedict and the chicken n waffles with coffee. Food was great, but a bit overpriced. Nothing thats going to stop me from coming back. Coffee tasted very fresh as well."}
{"text":"Service: Literally had the WORST waitress. Asked for oj and she said 'no', then walked away. Upon her return, I asked if they were out of OJ, she said yes. I said: \"wouldn't it have made more sense to say 'we're out\" instead of 'no'\"? The waitress walked away & never came back to take our order. We ended up having to flag someone down almost 25 mins later to take our order. It was the guy who originally seated us, he mentioned her name was 'Tanya' then he took our order right away. He was amazing. If I was giving 5 stars it would go to him. His service, conversation, and overall demeanor was the best! I get it, its Sunday. Its busy. But that doesn't mean you should treat your customers dismissively. When we were close to being done with the meal, we saw the waitress cleaning the table less than a foot from us, she never stopped to ask how we were doing, if we needed refills- nothing. I didn't know what to expect coming here, we were just looking for a delicious Sunday breakfast, but when we left we both stated we were not returning to this place.  Food: boyfriend ordered the birthday cake pancakes with a side of sausage. I ordered the Lumberjack with scrambled eggs. The home fries were amazing as well as the birthday cake pancakes. The food gets 4 stars.  Location: located in a shopping center that also features a farmers market, its a good location if you are in the area and want to eat after a leisurely morning of browsing/shopping. 4 stars."}
{"text":"This is my third time going to griddle cakes on eastern, its never consistant and i always have an issue with my food and let me just say, so not order to go! I got home and my home fries were half raw half soggy my eggs were fine but my 3 pieces of bacon were horrible! One was burnt to a crisp and the other 2 were still raw and completely pale! I have ordered the same thing there each time i go trying to give it a chance since we live so close but i will not be going anymore, the last 2 times my bacon was burnt and same thing with the home fries half raw and hard hald soggy no crisp! Seems like they need a new chef or make sure its right before it goes out to the customer specially when its a pick up order. Im upset and threw my breakfast out!"}
{"text":"How to recreate the Griddle omelet experience at home in 5 steps:  1. Throw all your seasonings and spices out the window. Don't forget the salt & pepper. 2. Use canned products whenever possible. Cook omelet until it reaches the consistency of styrofoam. 3. Roughly chop some potatoes and cook only until they are slightly browned on one side. Remember step #1. 4. Plate your creation. 5. Lay a Kraft Singles cheese slice on top the whole mess.  Adding one star because the servers were attentive and the patio is nice."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery from this restaurant via Postmates so I understood that the food would not be as fresh.  My husband had a tuna sandwich and I ordered the clubhouse.  Both were decent but not mind-blowing.  Maybe we'll try their breakfast next time?"}
{"text":"Ate here twice while on vacation in Vegas for a month. First time has a skillet, second time had crab Benedict. Both were extraordinary meals! Fast and friendly service too."}
{"text":"I arrived a little bit before they opened, as I waited outside they opened the doors about 5 minutes early. Service was professional and prompt.   I ordered a western skillet and coffee. The food came out within a few minutes, generous portions and the flavor is really good. It wasn't typical eggs and potatoes. I really enjoyed the breakfast and definitely plan on coming back."}
{"text":"I went to this place hopping to find sometime different for breakfast and to be honest I was a little disappointed. The food was not bad, but I didn't see anything special to it. I ordered the benedicts eggs and my friend got the southwest griddle.  My plate was not as great as I expected, however, the griddle looked a lot better.  I will give this place another chance and order a griddle or the red velvet packages which appear to be the most popular plates.  The services and the atmosphere were just ok."}
{"text":"Best in this hood Great food and great service Definitely this place will be my hangout breakfast place to go to, I am glad I found it."}
{"text":"Nice friendly cute restaurant  with good food and service.  My Husband and I   enjoy coming here to have breakfast."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Oddly, the pancakes are just ok. The waffles are much better. I don't care for the maple syrup. I never new maple syrup could be bad or just ok. But there's is, like diet soda, or gluten free food, no flavor.  Also, the lady that waited on us was nice, but came to the table while on her phone! I was shocked. Then, trying to get her attention was useless as she was in some heated phone texting behind the counter.   Finally, the bus boy helped us with more coffee and our check.  This is the kind of issue that would make me not return.  On the plus side, I really like their eggs Benedict. For that, I will return. I just hope I don't get the same waitress."}
{"text":"Quick seating for a Sunday morning and good friendly service. The food was good except for the fact that my pancakes were about near cold when I took my first bite. I assume they were sitting out for a bit before they were served along with our other friends pancakes that were also cold. Bummer!"}
{"text":"This place is amazeballs! Got a table right away on a Sunday morning. Great service and the food was outstanding. Highly recommend if you are in the area."}
{"text":"The batter they use for their waffles is off the chain!  It tastes like vanilla cake, so good!!!   Bad side..I've had horrible service there just about every time. Definitely hesitant to take family/friends there because of that."}
{"text":"Had a very pleasant breakfast here. Prices are not bad at all and food was good. :) If I could, I would probably come here for breakfast more often. It is a nice place to have coffee and converse. Staff was very attentive and the manager even came by to check up on us, which I thought was very nice."}
{"text":"Such a great vibe at this place. The service is always friendly and fantastic, the food is delicious, and the specialty pancakes are a thing not to miss! Thank you!"}
{"text":"I can't say I was too impressed with Griddlecakes. I was expecting a bit more what with the crowd of people waiting outside.   I had a group of 5 and it took about 35 minutes for us to get seated. We had a few moments to look over the menu before we ordered our food.  I ordered the chicken and waffles.  The chicken was quite dry and more batter-y than chicken. It even had that frozen look to it, it didn't make it look all that appetizing. I ate it nonetheless because I was huuuungry, but the chicken itself tasted okay- wasn't anything to be amazed by. the waffle was nice, warm and fluffy. it was a good portion of food. I wasn't too thrilled about my meal but it did its job.  It was pretty busy when we went so I understand that the servers were in a hurry.. I totally understand so I will just say service was good..   I'm not sure if I would come back though, not a fan of breakfast food in the 1st place and was hoping this place would help change my mind.. but it's okay.. I'd recommend to first timers in the area looking for a solid breakfast place."}
{"text":"This place is great for breakfast! I got the Arizona skillet with ground beef, jalapeños, potatoes, eggs, and cheese. It was so delicious! My boyfriend got the Belgian waffle - probably one of the best waffles I have ever put in my mouth. It was soft and buttery. The staff is very friendly and the restaurant is so cute. It is not too big and the sunlight just illuminates the place with positive energy. I will be back here!"}
{"text":"Wow this place is great.  I got the french toast (go small on that because the bread is really thick) with a side of eggs & bacon.  I love the texture of the french toast - how do they do that?  And this is the first place that ever actually listened when I asked for crispy bacon. Love it!"}
{"text":"Pretty average breakfast lol. The customer service was awesome. The food was good, nothing I'd brag about."}
{"text":"Waited an ungodly amount of time for our food and then none of it came out together  (half our party got their food then 5 mins later the other half got their food then 10 mins later they finally brought the rest of the sides that we ordered). Also noticed other people getting their food before us even though we were there before them  (and that pisses me off)  I got the monkey business pancakes and was disappointed in the dryness, they weren't nothing to brag home about and i didn't finish them.  My fiance got a veggie skillet with eggs and it was fantastic. The fresh squeezed OJ was tastey."}
{"text":"The name has changed to Griddlecakes and that's not all that had changed. The quality of the food and service has gone down and the prices have gone up. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Oh my gawd! The Crab Benedict is tooooo die for!!  The food is fresh. Hot. Fast. Yummy!!"}
{"text":"Griddlecakes. Just the name of the restaurant tempted me to drive across town to try this breakfast place, and reading the menu conveniently provided online was the final straw: I had to go here and get some Blue Jay pancakes!   My first disappointment was with the size of the place. When my husband and I arrived, we squeezed into the non-existent front area and tried in vain to find a hostess stand or even an employee to explain how the seating process worked. I finally walked to the back of the restaurant, found a random employee behind the counter, and got our names on a list. There is absolutely no place to wait besides outside because (1) the inside is TINY (2) it's crowded (3) the booths and tables come almost right up to the front door. So outside we went!   After a few minutes we were seated and brought two waters. Here began my next disappointment: The service here is terrible! There's about eight employees running around (which you think would be enough to serve the limited tables) but they all are either confused or just not attentive. We waited forever to order and then waited forever for our food.  And the final disappointment: The food. My blue jay pancakes, which I had drooled over so much when reading the menu, were just not that spectacular. The strawberries and blueberries were both unripe and hard, and the pancakes were chewy and tough. They definitely give you enough food though! If you're a light eater like I am, stick to one pancake.  Two stars because I think the concept of Griddlecakes was a good one, but the execution definitely is NOT."}
{"text":"Came here again this morning with the hubby for breakfast. They know what we drink and bring it right over..such amazing service! Our food was out in record time..seriously like 4 minutes..it was hella fast. I was still prepping my coffee!! I see why my hubby loves this place so much. I swear I am falling in love as well! The food is very good and they give us such speedy service. I will always come back..with the hubby of course!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch and breakfast. I went with a friend, I personally don't like eating breakfast food but my friend loves breakfast food. This is a great place for people who both preferred different options to eat. I got the meddy wrap with the cream of tomato soup, absolutely delicious, the tomato soup was creamy it complemented the wrap well. My friend enjoyed the French toast with eggs and potatoes, she also had the orange juice on the side. The orange juice was delicious, she raved about the flavor of the orange juice plus it had a lot of pulp which made it thicker, it exactly what you would want from a freshly squeeze drink. Overall the guys in the shop were nice, good customer service. We went toward the end of lunch and as you can obviously see it slowing down for them, we weren't rushed out. I would recommend to other people. Hope to see you guys soon!"}
{"text":"it wasn't packed around noon, so we were seated right away. the service is amazing, the staff was and is always very friendly and attentive. we tend to stick to our usual orders, so we gave our order right away and it came out within 15 minutes. their food is always delicious. i sometimes can't decided between eggs, bacon, and home fries, or the traditional or floretine eggs benedict. today i decided with the traditional eggs benny with home fries. the home fries are always tasty and a favorite!! my boyfriend likes the bacon (super crispy) and the gluten free griddle cakes with chocolate chips. the hot chocolate is a must have!"}
{"text":"GOOD Couldn't decide on a place for breakfast/brunch today so yelped a few places and found griddlecakes.  So glad I did...its close to my house off Ft. Apache in between Sunset and Russell by that old miniature golf place used to be... Anyways, the menu for breakfast is sweet...there are so many choices from a hot griddle breakfast, chorizo and eggs, biscuits and gravy, oatmeal, it goes on and on...  My eyes were definitely bigger than my appetite.  I stuck to my guns and chose from the pancake signature menu. The Blue jay was great! Added some turkey bacon on the side...  The great service only complimented how fast the food came out!!!  BAD Only thing bad was I didn't come here sooner...kudos to the griddlecakes team =) 5 stars all around."}
{"text":"The place is clean, the service is friendly and fast, the Tea is fresh, the food is really good and hot and the portions are worth the price, the condiments are clean (I hate when the ketchup bottle has old ketchup goop on it). It gets a to loud inside but it is a bit on the small size (got full fast, only seats left were outside) plus that could be because of all the old men having breakfast the morning we went (there were only 3 women and 25 men inside, the men all were loud AF and did not care about other diners) The only problem I have is they open at 7 and for someone like me thats late in the morning but as that being my only complaint I did not drop any stars since a lot of places dont fit into my schedule. Definitly will be coming back."}
{"text":"We just moved here and found this little gem.  If you like down home cooking, then this place is for you!  I ordered the breakfast burrito for my 4 year old daughter and holy smokes it was HUGE and we totally could have shared.  I got the two hotcake combo and again it was much more than I ever could have eaten.  The food was hot and really fantastic.  The service was great and the coffee kept coming.  I think we will make this our Friday morning regular."}
{"text":"I had a hard time finding the location at first because it was in the corner.  The tables are very close together. I couldn't even sit in my chair because of the group at the table behind it so I had to sit on the side of the table until they left. You could very easily hit the person behind you with simple movements.  There were a lot of choices on the menu that we wanted to try. My boyfriend ordered the daily special, \"Carne Asada Skillet,\" I ordered the \"Crab Cake Eggs Benedict,\" & we shared the \"Birthday Cake Short Stack.\" The food was okay, but nothing extraordinary. You can tell that the steak & crab were cheap quality. I prefer my house fries to be crispy & thin, but they made theirs thick & soft. Their pancakes were a good size.  Other than that, everyone was very friendly & they provided great service."}
{"text":"Visited Griddlecakes after months of passing by and saying \"we should go one day\". So glad we did. Hubby had the waffle and I had a regular egg and something breakfast with a pancake on the side. Everything was great, but the highlights were the waffle and the freshly squeezed orange juice. The waffle was really yummy. It was crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside and had a wonderful flavor. The OJ was super fresh. The decor is really cute and quaint, and the staff is very attentive and friendly. We will defiantly be back soon."}
{"text":"One of my favorite place to eat breakfast. I normally order the Skillets there. They provide you with three eggs and homefries are amazing."}
{"text":"Ordered the red velvet pancakes and they were not good at all, it didn't taste like red velvet and there was some berry syrup on it that gave it a really weird flavor. The rest of the food that my friend and I ordered was good. The waiter was nice and funny, but was maybe understaffed because we didn't see him very much. Overall pretty average."}
{"text":"Just a local breakfast joint that's really moderately priced for large portions! It has a great location being off Eastern but it's too sad that the place is small, causing the place to be really loud on a busy morning. Really cute décor and loved my standard eggs, hash browns, toast, and bacon. Can't wait to come back to explore the more unique menu items!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for brunch one day with the honey and it was delicious! We were seated right away and our food didn't take too long, either. It was a relaxing atmosphere, very homey. The food was really good and they are not stingy with their portions! We barely ate half of our food and our waiter was very generous with the coffee. Our waiter was really attentive and friendly overall. We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Ivan and the staff here have earned this place a four-star!  A neighborhood's favorite!  Griddlecakes has become my family's go-to breakfast place! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"So. The service. Just awful.   My mother and I stood at the front door and no one greeted us even though there were three servers working. One group left a table at the front and someone came by to clean it (and still didn't greet us). Then another server came by to talk to the girl cleaning and asked her if we were waiting for that table, she said yes. News to us.   When we sat down they immediately asked what we would like to drink, got that right away. Then we had to wait ten minutes while they took everyone else's order that walked in after us. Irritating to say the least.   Food came out in an average time but I wanted to ask for some hot sauce but couldn't get it out as the server ran away from us. Eventually someone came by and I asked (after already eating half my food) if we needed anything and she said she would grab it. I never saw it. I did see the check though.   Never coming to this place again. Thanks but no thanks."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place around. Philly skillet is delicious try it. The biscuits and gravy wow yum. The gravy is so light and the biscuits fluffy and soft."}
{"text":"Ok, ok. So 2-stars doesn't look great. And the truth is, I suppose it isn't. However, I should clarify that this isn't a \"bad\" review.  First - if you are looking for The Griddle like the one in LA, this isn't it, so don't get your hopes up.  Now...  One of the easiest things to make tasty is probably a simple plate of bacon and eggs with toast.  The Griddle accomplished that.  I ordered two eggs over easy, a side of bacon, and wheat toast. I got everything I asked for, and it was all pretty good.  Coffee was fine and my cup stayed full during our visit.  The atmosphere was ok and the service was friendly.  Was there anything special about The Griddle? Well..... no. However, if you want something that is an alternative to IHOP or another sort of generic breakfast joint, this isn't a horrible option."}
{"text":"YUM YUM, ALWAYS YUM.  The early bird catches the Chicken Apple Sausage breakfast.   added grilled onions, bell pepper, and mushrooms with American cheese to hashbrowns and 3 perfectly poached eggs."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Vegas!! Every Sunday we eat here and they never let us down! Awesome food but even better service!"}
{"text":"Great food and such nice friendly service,  especially Amber our server!  It's so nice that Griddlecakes so close to our house!"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, we were excited to try this place.  We had a little trouble finding it as you can only see their sign when heading southbound.  We came in northbound and only found out when we'd turned around at the end of the shopping center.  It was worth the egg hunt!!  Speaking of eggs, my over mediums were cooked to perfection!  You may be asking why I make a big deal about an egg, but we over MEDIUM lovers will tell you there is a difference. So many places give you either slimy undercooked eggs or egg custard without the cream or sugar.   Okay, of my soap box and back to the review... I ordered my bacon extra crisp and it was perfect! Hubby got a skillet and said out lacked a little seasoning but it was good.  Lemon blueberry pancakes were tasty but lacked the fluffy lemon consistency I was looking for.    By far, the best part of the meal was our server, Liz.  She was perky and really seemed to like her job. She chatted with us on and off our entire meal.  She also told us of a location closer to our home.    I think we found our go-to place when visiting our doctor on this side of town!  See you next time, Liz!!!!"}
{"text":"Our favorite place for a good breakfast/brunch. We come here at least 3 times a month. The staff is friendly and attentive and the coffee great. This place is perfect!"}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast!  Wow.  Not a typical breakfast place.  The fried chicken waffle and chicken spinach salad were scrumptious.  Portions were also very big and we couldn't finish either of them.  Owner (Frank I think) stopped by table and was very funny.  I will definitely be back!  5 STARS!"}
{"text":"Nice service and good food. They prices are very reasonable. Great place for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food and staff. Ontop of refills, and all u need to make ur meal the best!  Its our new fav place!"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite breakfast spot!  All of the food is awesome, especially the hashbrowns, french toast and red velvet pancakes.  Friendly service always.  Have also had the burger with roasted red peppers and avacado.  Tasty!  Smaller spot so timing is important.  Love that they have a few outdoor tables."}
{"text":"We were excited to try something new, some other than the usually IHop or Denny's. I thought it was a cute little place. The service wasn't too great but he was polite. The price was not too bad. Anyway, I ordered a chicken caesar salad wrap with fries. I got one whole stalk of lettuce (was not chopped at all), it also had like a garden mix of salad and very little chicken and dressing. The garden spring mix of veggies was very over powering the dressing and even the romaine. The fries portion was small. The waiter even tipped over my plate and the french fries were all over the table. With that being said, he didn't even give new fries. I asked for ranch and the ranch tasted like the ranch from the Kroger bottle that you would get from the local grocery store.   My husband ordered a philly cheesesteak skillet type thing. There was only about 2 bites of meat on it and the rest was all potatoes. His dish was somewhat tasty. LOL We just wished there was more meat on it. He also asked for the gravy to be put on the side and the gravy was bland.   They had about 7 employees there. Some were just sitting and lounging around . We waited forever for everything! All in all, we wouldn't go back and would not recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"I decided to try this new breakfast spot around the corner from my spot and wasnt disappointed - it wasnt exsctly hidden but you couldnt tell from the street where it was (before they added that awesome sign). I came here with a friend for a late lunch. I'll break down my visit into three sections.  Atmosphere: as soon as you walk in, the vibrant colors hit you. Its bright inside and welcoming. Theres about 10 tables, with three having the luxurious cushion seats (:p). I chose the cushion seats since I have lower back problems and they were comfortable. The music was low enough to have a conversation, but not enough to hear the table next to us listen in. The staff was welcoming as we sat.  Food: to sum it all up, it was on point. We ordered the monkey special pancakes and the arizona skillet. The pancakes were infused with a light peanut butter flavor with sliced bananas and nuts ontop. They werent right and definitely stood on their own without syrup. The phlliy had everything you'd expect in a sandwich - plentu of cheese, mushroom, and onion . The omelet came with choice of toast. The portion sizes are huge and worth the price.   Service: service was great - each time I went. We were given recommendations and knew the menu well."}
{"text":"Had brunch with my cousin and stumbled on this place when we got lost looking for truffles and bacon cafe lol. We decided to check this place out for Sunday brunch. We waited for about 15 minutes for a table and seared in a cozy booth. Ambiance was nice and they serve good coffee and always keep it coming. I had the chicken fried steak with scrambled eggs with fruit instead of potatoes. It tasted pretty good considering I'm from Texas and know good chicken fried steak. My cousin got a huge Lovers red velvet pancake which feeds 2 people. It was literally huge!! Pretty good considering it was less than $9. Prices are pretty reasonable for brunch. I will be back to try other items. Service was attentive and friendly. Overall good experience."}
{"text":"Great breakfast! The service was fast and friendly. The place was clean. I got the veggie scramble witch was delicious! The breakfast burrito was also tasty! Biscuits and gravy tasted like flour and was very bland. If they seasoned it a bit I'm sure it would have been great! Will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"Food here is pretty good, however, this place should be a five and it is borderline 2.  a.  Location - 5 star - Perfect Location on the east side of Eastern Avenue.  Plenty of parking and entry/ exit way.  b.  Ambiance - 3 star - A bit small, I think there must be about 12 tables inside and 3-4 outside. Way too small for people wanting breakfast and nowhere to sit. They cannot control their waiting line very well as there is nowhere to sit or stand.  c.  Food - 3 Star - I know I said it was pretty good, however, it is spartan at best. I ordered a made to order omelette with some veggies, jalapenos and peppers with egg whites.  Why they don't have a veggie omelette is odd and why charge me .50 per ingredient?  The omelette was small.  I did not want the home fries and asked for fruit. It was very little bits in a very small cup.  d.  Price - 2 star - So, why serve an omelette that looks like it was made with two eggs? Why serve it on a plate with lots of extra room, If you can count the pieces of bits on the plate, that means there is way too little. Only the toast seemed to be filling the plate.  I did not get my value for dollar theoretically as my cousins paid for breakfast.  e.  Service -1 star - Here is the biggest failing!  The service here is very poor. They do not come often to fill coffee, never remembering if you had decaf or regular. I had to ask for water twice and then ask them ask for refills. They cannot handle the wait line on a Sunday with any efficiency.  Really a poor way to go in my book.  GK says, this place could be great if they were efficient and organized and gave you value for your dollar.  I may go back, mainly because hanging with my cousins was awesome!"}
{"text":"Pancakes are huge. The corned beef hash was one of the better versions in the valley. Good service, fast food."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch for the first time the other day.  It was a great little place for breakfast.  I was excited to be able to order a breakfast meal at noon as well after a late night.    The place is cute, and was busy.  I ordered the Lumberjack (i believe it's called) which came with 2 HUGE pancakes, 3 sausage links, 3 eggs and potatoes.  The pancakes were DELICIOUS.  I highly recommend trying them.  I couldn't even finish half of the plate, but worth the $10 regardless!  I can't wait to go back and try one of their griddle plates!"}
{"text":"We had the Florentine & Traditional eggs Benedicts & Razzle Dazzle pancakes here. They were all phenomenal! Great tasting & great quality food. Our server Nick was friendly & provided exceptional service! It's my second time eating here. We'll definitely come back soon."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for over a year and it is wonderful. It is always the same friendly staff. The menu has such a huge variety but I love the French toast and skillets. There orange juice is fresh and so yummy."}
{"text":"After 10 minutes of not being asked what we wanted to drink ....we left as everyone else that was seated after us received service.... Just put a sign outside saying you won't serve the gay community and I promise I won't try giving you my money."}
{"text":"Another place I can't belive I haven't written a review on. I'm slacking!   We have been to Griddlecakes numerous times. We love it! The only complaint I have is that it's small. This place is always crowded! Expand and increase your business!  I have ordered too many things to count. I typically order the veggie skillet. Their potatoes are awesome. The skillet is a good size, and it comes with either toast or biscuits and gravy. Yum! The gravy is so creamy.   I have also ordered the plain pancakes, the lemon blueberry pancakes, the red velvet pancakes, and the smores pancakes (can't remember the correct name). I have also had the waffles. My husband has had the lumberjack, the breakfast burrito, and everything I have. Ha!   I haven't had a single bad thing at this place. Their service is ok. Could pick things up a little, but it's hard to when the place is so small, so they probably cannot fit more servers. We are always greeted and brought drinks right away.   I highly recommend this place. I haven't tried any lunch, but breakfast, this is our go to spot. We like them better than Egg Works."}
{"text":"Decided to check out this spot today. It was empty at 730a on a Saturday morning for breakfast but we still gave it a shot. We ordered the Chorizo Scramble and a special, Enchilada Skillet. Food had no flavor, no seasonings. Very bland so I guess we should have ordered cakes instead. The side biscuit & gravy had way too much gravy, had to search for the biscuit. We ate half of our meals, paid and bounced. The positive was that it was clean and the service was good. On the fence about trying it again."}
{"text":"The gluten free waffle is really great and it is nice to see gluten free on the menu, but the last two times I've gone they have been out of the gluten free waffles and pancakes.. Which is a really big bummer seeing as that's the reason I've come 2 times now. Besides that The service is great and other food is also good!"}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast/brunch place by far.  They have amazing pancake flavors and they're HUGE.  I had the lemon blueberry and oatmeal protein ... delicious.  It's clean and the service is great.  It's very small inside so you either have to be patient or beat the rush."}
{"text":"Walked in, it was nice and clean. Silverware was spotless the waitress was nice but kinda of slow on attending to us. Finally the lady at register noticed we were ready and approached us and took our order. The food was great and the drinks were great as well! Very \"Moms & Pops \" type of place! Loved it"}
{"text":"Awful. And the coffee was terrible like it was reheated. The service was great and quick but not worth it for the food."}
{"text":"3 words.. Fresh. Squeezed. OrangeJuice. I am in love with this place. Very small dining room and usually very busy but worth it. A definite must if you love breakfast. They even have flavored coffee creamer. Awesome find"}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday expecting it to be busy.  But once we were seated, it was 15 minutes before we were even given a menu.  The service was slow and hardly friendly.  I went there because they serve gluten free.  But only had 3 items.  And the waffles i chose were super bland boring and dry.  Was not worth the price or poor service."}
{"text":"Very tasty breakfast here this weekend. Had a pretty basic eggs over easy w/ sausage and potatoes, but I also had a side of biscuits and gravy which was delicious! Also, their coffee was tasty.  A little high on the prices for what we ate, but good service and cute place."}
{"text":"I'm gonna give the servers and hosts 5 stars. They were awesome. Drinks and food came out quick. But even with all that, the food was disappointing.  I ordered the chicken and waffles. Waffles was good but the chicken tasted old and maybe even under cooked. It had NO FLAVOR and the texture was rubbery. I took a few bites off the edges but then I couldn't eat anymore.  My kids shared the short stacked birthday cake pancakes. They ran out of strawberries so they topped it off with bananas. To my surprise, my kids took 5 bites and that was it. My kids love pancakes! What kids don't? I tried a bite and it seems like the pancakes were under cooked.  My husband ordered the corn beef and hash meal. He said he didn't even know If the food was horrible, he was too hungry to notice lol.  Overall, I was a completely unhappy customer. Ordering 3 entrees with 2 sodas and a coffee it added to $42, wasn't even worth going there."}
{"text":"Good little place to grab some breakfast. We had the Birthday Cake pancakes. Yummy and flavorful. They serve numerous types of gourmet pancakes. They are large! Sharing is a good idea. Such a neat little spot. Service was great. Server was so friendly and welcoming. Definitely a spot to return."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for breakfast on the morning we were leaving Las Vegas. There was an IHOP nearby but I'm really glad we ended up here. The eggs Benedict minus Canadian bacon was pretty tasty. They get real points for personality here though. Our server was really sweet and efficient even though she was brand new. I saw lots of folks who I suspect are regulars having coffee and breakfast. It really has that mom and pop feel to it."}
{"text":"I was really not impressed by this place. The food is pricey and it honestly is not that great. I felt like I was sawing wood trying to cut the pancakes they were really tough. My wife had the biscuits and gravy, but said it tasted like about what we could make at home with one of those packets of powder. In all we paid a whole lot for sow thing that was just not that good. We were very disappointed. The service is not great as well, which makes this a place we won't go back to. There are too many better places to eat breakfast in town to go back."}
{"text":"Great high quality food. Awesome owners and staff. I eat here 3 to 5 days a week!!! Best breakfast in town!!!"}
{"text":"Ok...this is what breakfast should be like. The place is cute and homely the service was good and the food was great.  I had the big Nevaden skillet which consists of seasoned ground beef and bacon topped off with over medium egg(well the egg was over over medium close to over hard FYI to the cooks some people like the yolk to run when split) over seasoned potatoes...delicious. My wife had country biscuits and gravy  because we got a little argument about me liking country biscuits (and after wouldn't share)...I didn't get to try it lol  but all good we did take back some home and I will get some(that will teach her who can and can't get some of her biscuits...lol) ok.... Now the finishing touch the gorgeous lemon blueberry pancake topped of with whipped cream...do I have to say more???  The only thing I would ask all waitresses on hand...if you are walking around with a full coffee pot in your hand...yes get to your tables but...look side to side and surrounding area if anyone would like some more coffee(your table or not... It's a team effort) Sorry I had to end it this way but... I sat coffee less for more than 7-8 minutes maybe even 10 minutes without my morning go and get up juice (while I watched as waitresses walked with full coffee pots in hand but because I wasn't thier table not one look...but this can be fixed...everything else great"}
{"text":"It would be nice if the business hours were included on this info. Maybe I'm just not seeing it. I like their eggs benedict. Pretty decent than most places."}
{"text":"Server came over to take drink order and never came back. Sat at the the table for about 10 minutes watching her before we just got up and left. No one even bothered to stop and ask what was wrong as we walked out. Never got to try the food but a one star for worst service I have had at a restaurant."}
{"text":"Bleh. Bland, underdone diner food. Needed serious salt and some additional time on the griddle. Soggy potatoes, ok omelet. Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"A nice place to stop and have breakfast.  Something different and delicious for your morning.  Service was great and fast.   The eggs were so fresh and a nice treat.  We are from California and we will come back each time we are in Vegas.   Also affordable"}
{"text":"Dont come on a Sunday. You get seated very fast but the wait for your food after you order is very long. I ordered the crab cake bennidct and because the wait was so long, my eggs became hard not runny. The servers however very attentive."}
{"text":"Meh. It wasn't bad food, it just wasn't really good food. Prices were reasonable, service was good, food was just ok."}
{"text":"We had brunch there this morning. Small place but we enjoyed the option of sitting outside. The food was priced fair and the quality very good. The service was really good considering how busy they were. We almost didn't go because of the poor reviews on service but I think they might be reading their reviews and trying to change because we didn't have any problems today. We will definitely go back! There was also a small farmers market in the parking lot so if you have to wait to be seated plenty of shops and the market to keep you entertained while waiting."}
{"text":"Awesome service.  One of the best places to go in Summerlin.  Highly recommend if you have kids."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our meal today! The reviews have been mixed, but we experienced great service and food. We recommend the pancakes and the biscuits and gravy. The pancakes are huge, though, i had a short stack and still had to take one home!"}
{"text":"So much sugar. The gluten free pancakes weren't that good, and the food was greasy and heavy. Not a fan. I guess it would be fine for someone who can handle tons of sugar."}
{"text":"Love this place. If I'm not there to sit down and eat, I am ordering out, usually they're gluten-free pancakes. I love those gluten-free pancakes. Also, it's nearby, easy to access, and always have pretty good service."}
{"text":"Service bad. Orange juice worse . Food is their only saving grace. If you get the orange juice you better specify small or you will pay $4 for a glass of pulp."}
{"text":"Stopped in for some quick eats, but we got rained in and decided to hang out in the little kids area they have in the corner!  +1 for The Griddle for being extremely KID FRIENDLY!  We ordered the Red Velvet Pancakes. These had TONS of chocolate chips in the batter and lots of yummy chocolate and strawberry sauce. Good choice!   Soul eats up pancakes like there is no tomorrow, and he was very satisfied with the portion size too!  The pancakes come with a side of eggs and bacon or sausage (or both).  I chose the latter, and everything was solid but not outstanding.  I think this is a great place to get some breakfast :)  Pics:"}
{"text":"Food is always awesome, love everything I have tried! The biscuits and gravy are amazing!! Service is great & Amber & Nick are very helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"This my favorite breakfast stop.  Had the pumpkin pancakes today. Without a doubt the best I have had.  All menu items are great which means you'll want to back again and again to try something new.  Be sure and check the specials blackboard.  Bring your appetite--servings very generous. Staff are the best.  That begins with the owner.  Top notch!!!!   Guaranteed satisfaction!"}
{"text":"Coming back to Vegas, I met with some friends for brunch here. Here and there, they'd boast of this place as though it was a religious experience. However, I beg to differ.  Service was decent - fulfilling the bare requirements of refilling my water and taking my order. Other than that, where's the conversation? Better yet, where is the smile?  Onto the food, I had ordered a breakfast concoction comprised of eggs, feta, spinach, and chicken. Pita on the side as well as potatoes, it was decent. The chicken was dried out, while the eggs were flavorless. I had a bite of my friend's breakfast burrito, which was good. However, my other friend's eggs and bacon looked dismal and...limp.  The one benefit of the Griddle is the location. Conveniently near the 215 and with a large parking lot, the store is easy to get to. The day I came, the doors were opened as to permit brunch fare to be eaten outdoors.  Honestly, other than the convenient location, there's not much bringing me back to the Griddle."}
{"text":"The Pancakes were amazing !! Coming back again to try the skillets. So many choices for my belly to enjoy. Service wasn't the greatest for not being that to busy. But still good enough to come back and try more yummy foooood."}
{"text":"I was really excited to finally try this breakfast place in my neighborhood since we always go to sunrise Café or IHOP but unfortunately the service is terrible my food was cold but my sons hamburger burned his tongue he couldn't even enjoy it. it's really not worth it and it's a lot of money."}
{"text":"This place is called Griddlecakes now. Small spot in a good location. My wife got sausage and eggs and I got the meat lovers skillet. Both came out quickly and both were good. We didn't order anything too elaborate, but food was good and atmosphere was mellow. Would recommend it for a casual breakfast or lunch"}
{"text":"Ate here after landing from an early morning flight to Vegas .  It's small , but we did not wait and the staff is very attentive .  My wife was surprised that they had gluten free pancakes .  She misses pancakes and said they were were amazing !  My niece ordered the meat lovers platter .  It was huge and amazing .  Came with biscuits and gravy too .  I ordered the eggs Benedict .  They were average , and I would try something else next time .  Overall , I highly recommend this place if you can break away from the strip for a meal ."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Las Vegas. Also great GF menu  with pancakes!!!!!"}
{"text":"We stopped in one day recently for a quick breakfast. I am glad that Vegas/henderson are getting more of these Breakfast lunch cafe's. The food was good staff super friendly. Many regulars were in here as the staff seemed to know them. I had the country fried steak of course. Again its a good way to get an idea of what they can do right. This was very good. Good gravy and also had a pancake since its what they do. pancake was fluffy and good. Could have used more syrup. Josie just had a pancake and was happy with her choice. I can recommend this and will go again if in the area for breakfast."}
{"text":"I love griddlecakes! We just tried it for the first time today and ate like absolute monsters because it was so good. My server was having a rough day... He was a little grumpy but has probably been up since 4am. The food made up for it though! We will be back soon."}
{"text":"The food and service were great. I had the Omelette with cheese and turkey sausage, my daughter had the red velvet pancakes. Fresh squeezed OJ was very tasty.   The  four stars are for the service and food. They need to be more attentive to details with cleanliness and decor. Several light bulbs were burnt out, dust on the walls and lights. I would like to see them deep clean this place. Lack of attention to detail with cleanliness always concerns me, because if they don't clean the place where customers sit and see, how does the kitchen look?"}
{"text":"I went with my husband for breakfast this morning. Staff is outstanding and the food tasty. Mark had scrambled eggs, Canadian bacon and hash browns. Also one pancake. I had the El Jefe,  Eggs, home fries, steak w/ cheese, was good.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Service was great.  The food was a different story. I ordered the red velvet pancakes and a side of eggs and sausages. The pancakes itself had no flavor but were drenched in chocolate and raspberry syrup. It was tough and rubbery which made it very unpleasant to eat.   The eggs tasted artificial and needed seasoning bad.   My husband who is just beginning to cook have made me eggs better than this.   The only thing I enjoyed on my plate were the fresh strawberries on top."}
{"text":"We loved this neighborhood breakfast diner. Although today I feel was my last trip back. Over the last few visits I feel that the quality of the food and service is poor.  The waitress we had today was upset with my complaint and expression of my disappointment of the food she had served me. Ask for owner and he was out but the manager on hand did offer an apology . Last but not least the price we paid was not worth what was served making the experience even more Un- enjoyable"}
{"text":"Great food the breakfast selections are great. The wait is a little long on the weekends go get the tree a little early."}
{"text":"Out of 5 yelp restaurants I have gone to, this was actually one I'd go back to. The blueberry pancakes were delicious....the only thing they need is a sign that's more colorful,  I passed it up twice before I realized that was the place."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast areas in Las Vegas and service!! We had a delicious breakfast and they let us taste the churro style waffle WOW We recommend Griddlecakes!!!"}
{"text":"One of my best friends and I ate here and I have to say the food was great I got a homemade sausage gravy and 3 egg breakfast with sourdough toast really good not great but really good for the price.  The service seemed to be attentive but needed to wait a while to have the half decent cup of coffee and water refilled.  Other than small issues the restaurant was very home felt and the food was above par. I'll be returning."}
{"text":"First time here since we just made vegas are forever home ;). The food was great and fast service. Very clean place. Our server was Amber and as busy as it was she was a amazing server..with a great smile and on point.  Will be back. Great family place for breakfast! Recommended.."}
{"text":"The good: portions are large. Seriously if you don't eat much, consider sharing a plate with someone.   If your ordering pancakes a 1-short stack will do- it's 10 inches!  if your a monster then consider the 2 or 3 short stack. I love the variety of flavors, I had the lemon-blueberry stack, very delicious combo especially the deep lemon flavor which I expected not to taste.   I also had the Veggie skillet, eggs and veggies over the homemade potatoes are delicious, the veggies were tasty and I think it's better if you don't have them scrambled as it comes w/three eggs (any style) I had mine over easy, w/ your choice of toast OR biscuit and gravy(no meat- YESSS!!)- it would not be advisable to order the biscuit and gravy w/the skillet, it's way too much. I thought it would be a small biscuit - but I was wrong.   The bad: seating sucks, it's cramped, I had a table next to an annoying mother, and suffered her opinions on the Mets and why sharing your food with your siblings is important- she wasn't even loud about it, but that's how close we were. The chairs are so uncomfortable my ass was killin me while I ate and after. The coffee wasn't very good. And not that this matters much- but my server had \"resting bitch face\" it's hard to enjoy your meal when your server looks like she about to cut you."}
{"text":"I would not return without strong coaxing. The food was nothing special. We ordered one of the skillets. I can't remember the name but it was the only one with feta cheese. Maybe my expectations were off but, when I have ordered skillets at other restaurants, the ingredients were integrated. At The Griddle, each item (scrambled eggs, potatoes, chicken and feta cheese) appeared to be cooked, placed on the iron skillet separately and then served. Additionally, the chicken was dry. The waitress also did not charge us the correct price for egg whites but, my friend did not want to address this as it was only a $1 over what it should have been.  I ordered the French toast as I heard The Griddle on Eastern was known for their French toast. The portion was a good size and they tasted fine. Not wonderful and not bad but, they would not bring me back to this restaurant over another place."}
{"text":"Foods not bad. Manager is a nice guys but the service...STINKS!!!! tall skinny girl with dark hair has a horrible attitude and should quit if she hates her job that bad!"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try this place out. We're always open to trying new joints. We were seated as soon as we walked in, took 10 minutes to get our waters and hot chocolate as well as another 10 minutes to even get out order taken by the waitress. Our waitress didn't even refill our waters nor did she come back to make sure we had everything. My husbands waffles came out 20 minutes AFTER our main breakfast entrees which was annoying cause he wasn't able to enjoy it cause we had waited so long to get it. Service was just horrible and there was so many workers there! Never going back to this place again."}
{"text":"Items Selected: Buttermilk Biscuits French Toast Short Stack of Chocolate Chip Buttermilk Pancakes  Locally owned and operated, with two locations stretching the Valley from Southeast to Northwest, it was to Griddlecakes North Jones location that I pointed the GPS on Saturday morning after a late Friday night out, and arriving just prior to 9:30am to a packed house it was to charming youthful service that I was greeted, a small two top on the fringe of the kitchen my seat for the next hour of traditional American breakfast fare.  Clearly a popular choice of locals, the space brimming with folks aged seven months to seventy plus years, water was delivered simultaneously with a menu upon seating and deferring on coffee that smelled just a touch overroasted it a brief perusal of the menu that saw three items ordered, the restaurant's free WiFi keeping me occupied during a twenty minute wait in which I was checked on frequently with water topped off twice.  Not a place to reinvent the wheel, though a few novelties are offered, it was entirely with personal favorites that I decided to test the Griddlecakes' kitchen and after eschewing the warmed pseudo-syrup in favor of good stuff brought from home my first bites of the restaurant's French Toast spoke to a classic presentation really no different than that which can be made at home, the bread a store-bought eggy sort with just enough cinnamon and vanilla in the batter to tickle the palate with the center was still just a touch doughy, a longer soak perhaps overlooked by a line-cook facing the weekend morning crush.  Moving next to a short stack of pancakes, billed as 'large,' by my young server and topped with a $1.99 surcharge of chocolate chips, suffice it to say that pancakes double the size of those offered at Griddlecakes are offered at no-less than a dozen spots in Las Vegas and although preparation was 'good enough' given the $5.99 tab these too were nothing special, the meal's lone standout a pair of buttermilk biscuits that were undoubtedly house-made given their oblong flattened shape and all the better for it with ample notes of buttermilk still notable after a lacquer of butter and honey, both.  A competent breakfast kitchen serving up American standards at a fair price, Griddlecakes is a good locals spot for those in the Northwest, and presumably the Southeast, but certainly not a destination - similar fare found at a similar price at not only several other mom n' pop places, but also in the cafes of several major casino cafes 24-hours a day."}
{"text":"Amazing food.  I love hole in the wall breakfast places and this is one is the best.  Clean,  friendly and food was top notch.  A must visit when in Vegas. You won't  be disappointed..."}
{"text":"This place is amazingly good! Friendliest staff members ever! Their pancake is huge  I ordered corn beef and eggs and I enjoyed my food. My husband ordered Lumber Jack, he only ate half due to huge serving! David is amazing, he such a funny and entertaining guy .. I will definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"I brought my daughter here for some breakfast and we weren't disappointed. The service was awesome, we shared the red velvet pancakes and eggs and it was great. Would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Had never gone there before and decided to check it out. Me and my wife went and sat down immediately so no wait there. The girl that served us was nice and gave us our drinks quickly. The only thing is that at least the orange juice is not a free refill. The wait was longer than other places I've been at. More than 30 minutes I believe. When the food came it was very tasty and big portions. So no complaints there. Overall the service could be a little bit better but on the food side it was great."}
{"text":"Food was good.  But on the same day after I dined there, I had this food poisoning/ stomach flu or maybe it was just too greasy for me, anyway my belly was hurting and I didn't feel good for couple days.  Urh!   BTW the server he is cute so I guess it's worth it?"}
{"text":"This was our second visit and I can't wait for visit number three so I can try more things! My husband, daughter and I all loved our food and the portions are huge. This time I went with a veggie skillet and lemon blueberry griddle cake. The service is really good too--my family will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"I'm a single mom of an 11 year old and rarely have time just to myself.  When I do get a few hours alone,  I love treating myself to breakfast here.  The staff are wonderfully efficient and sincerely friendly. I've never been disappointed by the food.  The dishes are huge and so yummy! The oatmeal is so pretty and tasty you forget you're being healthy.  My daughter loves the burger and fries here too!"}
{"text":"Wasent to bad as far as taste but servuce and order times are a little long . Walk in dont know what to do no one greeted or said comming kind of just stand there all tables were dirt. Live up the road from it not worth a trip back"}
{"text":"Pancakes are huge and they offer red velvet, whoot!  I had a craving and it needed to be satisfied - unfortunately though I don't really dig chocolate and the red velvet pancakes available here, had a prefix batter with chocolate chips already in them  but the parts of no chocolate I could get with the cream cheese frosting were delish.   2 stack of specialty pancakes were I believe $5.99. I also got a fresh squeeze orange juice - 8oz is small, totally worth it but wish it was chilled but that's a minor thing. I ordered a side of home fries which were pretty much big cubes of potatoes - it was okay but did have some uneven seasoning and most of the seasoning tasted like pepper and that was about it.   I might be back but not sure. Waiter was nice though."}
{"text":"What a nice change from a Denny's or IHOP!  A warm and inviting atmosphere, we were seated quickly, and the food was out in only a few minutes (it was a busy Sunday morning, too!).  It's a little pricey for what it is, though, so I'll give it 3 stars.  If you're nearby and looking for a change from the typical chain breakfast joint, give it a shot!"}
{"text":"Great Florentine Benedict and home fries! Next time I'll try an omelet. The staff was really friendly and welcoming. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great place for everything breakfast! First off, Frank (owner) is the best. I love the atmosphere of the place. The waffle is killer. One of the best pancakes in the city. The french toast was masterful. Don't go by reviews of people trying to be Gordon Ramsey! They're not. I'd looked for 2 years in the Las Vegas area for a pancake that could measure up to that of Cracker Barrel...I found it here.   The Grand Cafe at Green Valley Ranch is the only other place that has a great pancake with awesome taste BEFORE you add the syrup and butter.   Come to The Griddle! It's worth it."}
{"text":"Kind of a small space, but the food was delicious. Service was efficient and everything was reasonably priced. will be back!"}
{"text":"went there for lunch today with a co-worker. We work right down the street so it seemed convenient to go and we always like to support places near the office.    Very disappointed.  The chairs are not comfortable at all.  My friend had a turkey club that was as she described it bleh.  I had the tuna croissant - tuna tasted off, no mayo on the bread - guess I had to ask for that to be put on the bread but it was dry.  Cheese not very flavorful.  Fries were best part of the meal.  Server never asked if everything was ok and we had to ask for a bigger box for my friend to put half of her sandwich in."}
{"text":"Great food, good customer service, it's very small inside so you might come out smelling like food."}
{"text":"If you like pancakes that cover the entire dish, then Griddlecakes is the place to enjoy hot cakes!  The breakfasts seem a little pricey, however the food is good, always fresh and the taste is spot on!   I have enjoyed the Corn beef hash a few times and the good old Bacon Eggs is always a winner!  You are going to love the home cook potatoes that come with each breakfast."}
{"text":"This will be short and sweet..... I love this place!! It has the mom and pop vibe that I love!! I ordered the lumber jack today... Should have taken a pic but I gulped it up to quickly. I've been here at least half a dozen times before and enjoyed everything I have ordered.   That being said... Why I am giving it a 4 instead of a 5. Sometimes the service is slow. Not really the waiter is slow, the kitchen. I've always had wonderful waiters and my drinks are always filled and when I ask for something, I have it right away. The food takes a little longer than I think it should.... But.... The food is always hot, fresh, and wonderful. So all in all I am extremely impressed.   Ok so not so short..... Thank you to Antonio this afternoon.... He was an awesome server!!!"}
{"text":"Great little local place! Skillets, pancakes and omelets are delicious.  Freshly squeezed orange juice and the kids enjoyed the massive hot cocoa with tons of whipped creme and chocolate sauce.  Yummy!"}
{"text":"Wonderful, wonderful.  Met family for breakfast.  Let us talk and talk; never felt rushed.  Hubby loved, Loved the benedict.  I had the Arnold, protein pancakes with bananas and will order them again next time. All the adults did state that our butt and the chairs just didn't seem to be the right fit.  Least of my worries because the food and service were good."}
{"text":"This place was excellent everything on the table was delicious! This is definitely a place to come back to next time I'm in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"I wasn't super impressed by this location which made me sad. I had been waiting forever to have an excuse to try Griddlecakes, so when my fiancé asked me where I wanted to get breakfast one morning I immediately suggested here. We went in on a Monday morning around 10:30-11 and were told we could sit anywhere. We had just sat down when someone came up to ask for our drink order...I hadn't even opened the menu yet so I was a little taken aback. I wanted to order juice or a mimosa but I was too overwhelmed so I just ordered a water. Then our waiter came back and I ordered The Arnold pancakes and my fiancé ordered a three stack with blueberries with a side of bacon and two eggs. We got our food soon after and mine was really good, but he wasn't impressed with his. The blueberries were cooked into the pancakes but we both thought they would be on top of the pancakes...a little nitpicky sure. But what really got us was the side of bacon and eggs. It was definitely NOT two eggs that we were served (see picture.) I was going to complain but after we got our food we never saw our waiter again. Luckily we got to use the Yelp checkin coupon, or I would have walked away feeling cheated.   I'm willing to give you another shot Griddlecakes, but for now I am disappointed."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful experience here. I was greeted as soon as I walked in the door and was immediately seated. Drinks came quickly and I liked that they had flavored creamer for the coffee. Hardly any places have that these days, so it was definitely a plus for me. Food overall was good. I had the crab cake Benedict, my SO had the Philly cheesesteak skillet and our little one had pancakes. The pancakes were some of the best I've ever had. The were fluffy and full of flavor, no syrup was needed. The steak in the skillet was seasoned perfectly. The crab cake was a little fishy, but that was to be expected. Servers were very attentive. Our glasses were never empty and the coffee was good. I asked for another cup of coffee right as we paid the bill and they offered it to me in a to-go cup, which I personally thought was very polite of them. Would definitely recommend this place to people looking for a breakfast spot in the area and we will definitely be back to try other menu items."}
{"text":"Such a great place for a pancake breakfast! Stumbled upon this place on a Sunday and we had a lovely server named, Audrianna. She was so nice and very attentive to our orders and gave us suggestions on what she thought was best and popular menu items.   I ordered the garden skillet and tried the red velvet and lemon blueberry pancakes. The garden skillet was great, but I wish the potatoes were cut smaller. The pancakes weren't too sweet, but they are huge so you definitely would want to share.   Overall, the prices and quality of taste were good."}
{"text":"Great cakes.  Had the Monkey Business, wonderful fluffy pancake.  The food takes a little time to get out because they are making the food fresh.  I would easily rate the pancackes as top 10 in Vegas.  Fresh OJ, freshly ground coffee, thank for doing breakfast right!"}
{"text":"Great little breakfast and lunch spot, everything was perfect! Prices were great and a very friendly and welcoming staff. I got the Arizona skillet it was delicious, my friend ordered the smores' pancakes and they were amazingly fluffy and spongy. Definitely going to come back to this place again."}
{"text":"We were looking for a good breakfast that was away from the crowds of the strip and this was a solid place that we ate at. The service was quick and the food prices were very good considering that it is in Las Vegas. They have a wide variety of options, even red velvet pancakes, as well as eggs and other items. This is a good choice for breakfast in Vegas away from the crowds."}
{"text":"There's not a lot of seating in here so you sometimes have to wait. It's a great locals place for breakfast, they have some healthier options and some not so healthy at all.  It's pet friendly outside and the staff is always very friendly."}
{"text":"Impressed on my first visit.  Started with my peach mimosa.  Followed by more food than I could eat.  Had to try the griddlecakes for the obvious reason!!  The staff was attentive.  Looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"Very Friendly staff.. I like the little kids play area. It kept our toddler busy. Food was nothing special, quite bland and coffee tasted old. Overall it was nice and we will come back bec of the kids area & service."}
{"text":"Nice, happy little place I tried for the first time.  The service was great with the staff really seemed to like what they are doing.  We had a Philly skillet with a side of biscuits and gravy, and the BLT with soup.  The food was what you'd expect from breakfast/lunch diner with nothing really blowing my socks off.  That being said, I'll definitely go back here before I'd go to the IHOP across the street.  I love a good mom and pop shop!"}
{"text":"This place was not good! Disappointed! The Griddlecakes were so dry and the bacon was meh! The hostess that sat us looked so grumpy and not happy to be there. Only saw our waitress once after she took our order and everything was rushed. I got the lemon blueberry pancakes with scrambled eggs and bacon and my husband got the same thing except his pancakes were peanut butter. Never going back! Would put zero stars if I could."}
{"text":"I went to griddle cakes today and everything was AMAZING.  I'm very picky about my potatoes and eggs and everything was Perfect. If you are ever in the area of Eastern /215, you have to go there."}
{"text":"We've only been here once but we'll be back for sure.   They have gluten free pancakes and they taste really good. After they came out looking so good we had to verify that they were in fact gluten free. My husband loved them (he's the gluten free one) and to me they tasted like normal pancakes.   We had the red velvet and the monkey business.  Also had bacon, sausage, eggs as sides. I thought the red velvet were suppose to come with whipped cream cheese but it was regular whipped cream.   I can't wait to try their other pancakes and breakfast items.   The wait staff were polite and attentive. Service was quick (note, we went on a Wednesday morning)"}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place! The food is always great and the staff is always nice & friendly! Sunday mornings get pretty busy but definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"My go to breakfast joint. Nothing super special about the menu...just the classics. Always great service and the food is served promptly. I think I like that it's just the classics. I'm not in to fusion when it comes to my first meal of the day. Good mug of coffee and fresh squeezed OJ. Really...what more do you need?"}
{"text":"Come here all the time and I always try to have something else. I have never been disappointed. My only complaint is that they close at 3pm. And I work nights. But always clean, great staff and bomb food!!!!"}
{"text":"Went yesterday morning.  Enjoyed food and prices.  A little small or I would have given it a 5.  Loads of choices.  Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Pretty solid breakfast. Real eggs for scrambled. Reasonably priced. Good flavor. Their OJ was great tasting with lots of pulp. The place was clean. Service was friendly and fast. Will come back.  Went back and had l wait over twenty minutes for an order that never materialized because there \"was a big table before us.\" Really? Everyone else got served.  Left and called the manager to complain and she tried to argue with me that it had not been 20 minutes. Last time we went and ate there it was a bit of a wait as well."}
{"text":"I wouldn't go back Here.  Coffee tasted like Motor Oil and potatoes were sub standard... It's too bad."}
{"text":"Nothing special here. In a dense restaurant market on South Eastern, this can easily be missed and forgotten. Everything was plain and average for a breakfast joint. From the plating, seating, menu. Most egg plates are coated in cheese. I had to ask 4 times from three different servers for a glass of water but god forbid I take a sip of coffee and they're there to refill immediately.   Example conversation from any other table dining.   Bob: How's your meal?  Jim: Ehh...."}
{"text":"Amber has the best service ever. Came here the first time, so many food option, can't wait to eat!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a delicious, hot breakfast this morning at griddlecakes. Servers are very friendly, attentive to their tables and quick on their feet.  Food came out hot and extremely fast, while maintaining it's flavor. Portion sizes are big and I guarantee you will leave happy, and with a full belly.  I had the gluten free pancakes while Jordan enjoyed the meatlovers scramble. We both loved our meals.  Cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places for breakfast in Las Vegas. The staff is amazing, service is always great and the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"There is a small selection of gluten free items available including some omelets, gluten free pancakes and gluten free waffles. The waffles were so good I will probably never have frozen ones at home again.   Service was good and the prices were reasonable. I will be back again."}
{"text":"Customer service is NOT a priority here.  two stars is just for the food.     I honestly didn't have any complaints about the food, however the service was horrible.   My eggs benedict was perfect, french toast was good and my friend said the vegetable skillet was good as well.  The pancake was cooked perfect, had a nice crisp to it and not burnt.  Thanks to Yelp we got to try a free yummy pancake !!! The food isn't extraordinary, but I would definitely come back if they stepped their game up on service.      We waited about 20 minutes outside for a table, when there were clearly tables open outside.  Then when the lady called my name she asked would you like to sit outside ?  Umm I thought first available was what that meant ... guess not.   When we sat  down we literally had to wait another 10 min before my group got irritated and actually had to go inside the store and ask for a server.  Now when the server got there, took our order he was great.  Then after that we didn't see him again.  Someone else refilled our drinks.  The food took way too long that you're starting to notice other tables seated before us received their food.  By the time we got our food they were super quick to give us the bill, which is fine.  However no one came back to us so once again we had to go inside and pay and when we did ... we got someone else's bill which was a mess.     It was my first time and last time my friends and I will be visiting here."}
{"text":"I'm giving it 3 stars because I enjoyed the food, but unfortunately the service was extremely slow. I was there this past Sat and arrived at 9:40am. We didn't leave until close to 11:15 am. I wouldn't have minded so much but we saw 4 groups of people who sat down after us and left before us. It took about 40 minutes just to get our food while other guests were served immediately. Just a tad rude to be forgotten."}
{"text":"This. Place. Is. Awesome!  I've only tried the smores pancakes as far as the cakes go but every other carnivorous meal is always better than the last.  The staff is super friendly, easy on the eyes and very accommodating.  They learn who you are very quickly and what you like. You walk in and they ask if you're having what you normally get then seat you.  They also do promotions for leaving reviews and contests to win free breakfast for your family.  All around, this place is my go to when I want to bring the kids to breakfast."}
{"text":"A breakfast spot that has small town quality - your coffee cup will never be empty. Rosie and Malayna will take care of you with beautiful, humble smiles. It's a family favorite: high quality food, great ambiance, and the buzz of happy customers. Every Sunday you'll find us at Griddlecakes:)"}
{"text":"We decided to give the griddle a try this morning as our regular breakfast joint was busier than usual. This place just doesn't do it for me. The service is rather random as any of 3-4 people bring things to your table. The food is average at best: eggs were good, bacon limp and french toast thick but not very good. The decor is also kind of random with tables on top of each other and crowded with over-sized condiments. I don't anticipate a return visit."}
{"text":"Had postmates delivery,  ordered the BlueJay no whipped cream and Ihop pancakes would've shined next to these dreadful things, French fries looked loke they can from the freezer,  all was very underwhelming and way too over priced for what we received.  I don't post but its almost offensive to pay for the food that was less than average.  I will say the eggs were cooked well."}
{"text":"I frequently come to Griddlecakes and today's visit makes me never want to return again. I placed an order for to go for a breakfast burrito. I arrived to pick it up and it was busier than usual. I proceed to my car and check my order and the potatoes were not fully cooked . I'm not one to complain about food at restaurants, but I just had to this time. I bring it back and they proceed to fix the order for me. They bring  the food back out and they took out half the potatoes and looks like they just attempted to refry the same ones. I didn't have the time to argue so I come home. They also took out my side salsa that came with the burrito. I'm so disappointed. My burrito is very soggy and my potatoes are just refried. Very disappointed from today's visit. Won't come back. Very overpriced for what it is."}
{"text":"The food is amazing! The service could've been better. The server seemed to be overwhelmed and didn't bring out butter for us when we had asked. Not a big deal though, I can't be mad when it comes to breakfast food lol"}
{"text":"I've been here twice so far. Both visits were pleasant. The first time, it was packed and thankfully we didn't have to wait. Although when we walked in, it did take a minute to figure out if we needed to wait for a hostess or just sit at an empty table... a little confusing at first.  Overall the food is delicious! Both times we had something off the breakfast menu (they have a lunch menu as well) It's a cute space and it looks clean.. They definitely have room for improvement.. I would say for new guests who don't really know how the seating goes. But over all it's been a positive and good experience! =)"}
{"text":"So we are at the end of our meal and do have a review to give.   1) I ordered the El Jefe- which is a chopped steak with peppers, onions, tomatoes, and home-fries served on a open-face flour tortilla with eggs. My first impression is the food is very bland. No seasonings whatsoever. I get that some places will not put salt or pepper due to \"salty\" complaints, but one should at least attempt to flavor their foods. The \"chopped\" steak looked like sliced beef you would use for a philly.  2) My fiancee order the Country Fried Steak and Eggs. Again, very bland, no seasoning. She couldn't even taste the seasoning in the batter used to fry the meat.  We also ordered the Half Biscuits and Gravy. Yet again, another let down. These biscuits are amazingly fluffy and airy.. very similar and highly comparable to Blue Berry Hills biscuits. The sad part came in their form of \"gravy\". Again, very bland and tasteless. It's almost a disgrace to put this \"gravy\" on these awesome biscuits.  We also tried the Short Stack Monkey Buiness Pancakes. Yep!! You guessed it! No flavor at all either. The pancakes are supposed to be peanut butter batter... this has to be the blandest pancake batter I have ever tasted.   Whenever we go to a new place to eat, I always try to sit by the kitchen. The cleanliness of the kitchen is always an indicator of the type of food service coming out of it. We sat right by the opening of the kitchen entry (open entry, no doorway) and the first thing we noticed is how dirty the floor is. Yes, I know a working kitchen is supposed to have a dirty floor, but it looks like they do not sweep the floor all day until close to closing time. By the amount of food and trash on the floor, one would assume this kitchen does 300+ covers a day.   My kids had the kids bacon and eggs and the chicken fingers with fries. (Chicken fingers and fries, best tasting food on our table- frozen premade foods).  Now, before you crunch up your face, get upset, and say \"these are just crappy customers with no sense of taste\".. I have been in culinary for 16 years. My fiance is currently in culinary. We both hold management position at two of the biggest hotel/casinos on the strip.   This is just my honest review of this place."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Fresh ingredients, nice people and fast service! If you choose this breakfast/lunch cafe in hopes to find a new favorite you will be pleasantly surprised :)"}
{"text":"I am a big fan! This is my BF and I's go-to breakfast spot. I am off during the week, and when we share a day off, we usually stop here for breakfast.   It's small, so I can only imagine how busy it is on weekends. During the week we usually have no problem getting a table. The service is fast and friendly and they have a great selection. I have tried just about all of specialty pancakes - I think my favorite is probably the Blue Jay, which are lemon blueberry pancakes topped with whipped cream and blueberry compote. We are also HUGE fans of the breakfast burrito - I might go so far as to say it's the best I've had in town (taco shops excluded). We always add mushrooms and spinach to it and it's so delicious! Their potatoes don't look like much, but are really tasty. My only complaint would be just a general gripe about the pancakes - although they are tasty, they end up being tough most of the time. Like, not fluffy....anyhow, I enjoy them nonetheless."}
{"text":"Wonderful discovery. Every staff member is very friendly. Great club sandwiches with choice of salad, soup or crinkle fries, who can resist those? Atmosphere is lively, friendly, peaceful. They close at 3 pm daily so take note of that. They also have a yelp check in special bonus.  So glad to have discovered this lovely comfortable place!"}
{"text":"Everyone is always friendly when I come in here. Today I went for the pancakes....I had the lemon blueberry batter with the blueberry compote and my daughter had some red velvet specialty concoction, we added eggs and bacon as a combo.   The pancakes were sooooo good! I absolutely loved the lemon blueberry, it wasn't overly sweet and was light. The red velvet was definitely decadent with all that chocolate syrup or whatever was drizzled in it. My daughter through she would hate my lemon blueberry batter and loved it.   I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it always chilly in there and then you sit on metal chairs that aren't the coziest. I like the padded bench seat...but we always fight over who sits on it....lol"}
{"text":"I went to eat breakfast here this morning and I have to tell you that WOW it was a great place to eat breakfast!!  I will be eating here at least once a week!  The waitress was polite and the food was great and reasonable!  Had the Eggs Benedict and I will make sure to treat myself every Friday!!! Thank you for a great experience!"}
{"text":"We shared the breakfast special that includes two pancakes.  Cost was $11.99 for this entree, and a dollar extra for the upgrade to a specialty pancake.  We chose lemon blueberry.  Pancake was a bit too thick for my taste, but it was filled with lots of fresh blueberries.  U really couldn't taste the lemon flavor though.  And the pancakes were big!  It came with 3 eggs and either sausage or bacon and potatoes.  I chose sausage- it was different tasting than your normal sausage.  Overall, food was decent and I would come here again!"}
{"text":"My Sunday ritual! Not only do I look forward to my weekly biscuits and gravy (the best) but I now look forward to seeing this great and friendly staff every weekend! Tried the chicken, mushrooms and feta skillet recommend by my server. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Hi, had breakfast here recently and really was not too impressed.  The good news is the place is clean and roomy with a kids area for little ones to play in.  So that is all nice.  But the food is somewhat lacking.  The menu is not that large in the first place and then the food we had was lacking.  We had an omelet with potatoes and the potatoes were undercooked and inedible.  Also had red velvet pancakes and those were ok, but those who know about/have tried Babystacks' version, I have to say those are better by a mile.  So I am not sure I will be back there are so many breakfast places in the area that mediocre really doesn't do it."}
{"text":"The entire menu is amazing! From skillets to salads to pancakes! Definitely go for my favorites between the Arnold or S'mores stack, OR any creation! And the best part are the large portions!! I love me a lot of food! The staff is super friendly and attentive! I can't wait to go again! Go check it out!"}
{"text":"Great food, lot of choices, and excellent customer service.  I especially like their egg Benedict.  We will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast!!!! and lunch to! Yummy variety and friendly staff!!! Quick service! Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"I was referred from a neighbor business and very happy with the homey atmosphere n definitely the grandma's home cooked meal taste! I even invited some friends n family to join bc the food comes out fast n it's inexpensive enough for me to treat. Steak & eggs n a free upgrade to lemon blueberry pancake were definitely my choice but we'll c what the rest of my party chooses?!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, clean restaurant, and great food. we had the chorizo and eggs and the pumpkin cakes, both were very good."}
{"text":"I had their veggie scramble, which was solid if overall unspectacular. Not totally unreasonably priced but at $12, I think a bit pricey, even though the serving size is pretty large. It had a solid taste, but I can't say that I would be in a hurry to get back again."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great little breakfast place"}
{"text":"In an increasingly competitive breakfast spot field, this place offers a fast and affordable alternative.  They have only been opened for 4 weeks and it shows.  The waitresses, although nice, lack a sense of urgency and just meander around forgetting the simple things such as utensils  coffee refills and water. The food was good, not wow, but again, we did not have to wait for a table on  Sunday at 10 am. We'll probably come back and give them another chance. Hopefully they get better organized before they become popular and busy."}
{"text":"This is a cute restaurant that is located in a shopping center surrounded by so many other eating establishments.   After reading the reviews on Yelp I decided to take my family here for breakfast.  We had a party if 8 adults and 3 children. When I walked in we were greeted and then they went to work rearranging the tables to accommodate us. They were very pleasant and made sure we were being taken care of. They quickly took our orders and in no time at all they came back out with our food.  The food looked amazing. The taste was just as good. What a amazing breakfast. Loved the food and the staff.  You can't go wrong eating here. You get your money's worth at this place. The amount of food on each order was amazing.   We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"The food is great, the service not so much. We never got checked on to see how our food was and a few bites into our food he drops the check. I'm a server so when I go out places I hope to get the same service I give when I'm serving my guest. I had to ask for hot sauce and more coffee. Their Portuguese sausage and eggs is good and their biscuits have a nice buttermilk taste to them. Such a disappointment when the service doesn't match up to the food."}
{"text":"Our server amber was amazing she recommended the Philly skillet and it was great and it was made so quick before I got settled it was on the way out Great place for a filling breakfast."}
{"text":"Fantastic place for breakfast!!  Costs less than IHOP and far superior flavor.  The home fries are to die for.  My HAM steak was perfect.  My wife's breakfast sandwich was perfect.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Love the griddle! Good home cooking although I get the same breakfast dish which consists of an egg white omelet loaded with veggies, English muffin and fruit cup instead of potatoes. However I must say their potatoes are awesome if you want to splurge. They have great streaming hot cups of coffee! I've also had their oatmeal bowl with fruit and granola that was super yummy and the presentation was great.  For lunch I've had their Mediterranean salad which is a huge bowl full of veggies, a scoop of hummus and pita bread. It's worth sharing cuz it's huge.  My bf likes their breakfast skillets but has been disappointed by their biscuits and gravy b/c they are always cold. Bummer.  The griddle is a good local place for brunch.  Con- the service is kinda slow"}
{"text":"So I had never been here before and the wife and I stopped in to try. We walked in with high expectations, as we love small breakfast/lunch restaurants! We were not let down in the slightest! Wife had the eggs Benedict(Rebel style) and I had the grilled chicken/bacon sandwich. We also ordered a small stack of griddlecakes(seeing as the place is CALLED griddlecakes). The pancakes crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. Adding the whipped butter they were heavenly. My wife's eggs Benedict were amazing and I enjoyed my sandwich. One of my favorite things about this place was the service. Everyone in the restaurant was there for us. The only criticism I have is that the staff should introduce themselves. Other than that this is an excellent place to have a nice breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"Thank you Marissa! Breakfast  was great,  service  was amazing!  Great  place to spend some time  with  family. They  even  allow dogs in the patio. 2nd time here, definitely will be a 3rd and 4th time. .."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch the other day & it was an awsome experience! Our waiter was super friendly I don't remember his name unfortunately but he was tall and blonde. We ordered and about 10-15 mins later our food was out to us! They were really quick and very attentive, we basically didn't have to ask for anything which is nice. The food was good portions & it was really good! Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Reopened now as Stacks and Yolks same owners. Breakfast was excellent reasonably priced very quick service great coffee will certainly be back."}
{"text":"Tried a variety of dishes and food has always been delicious. Staff is always friendly, attentive, and courteous.  The place is small so get there early."}
{"text":"O.J. was DELICIOUS!  Food was yummy.  Service was very polite, helpful and efficient.  Lower marks given because they DO NOT have butter in this establishment at all, margarine only... blech! What kind of a breakfast place only has margarine?"}
{"text":"The Hawaiian Special is fabulous!!  The service is okay and busy on Saturdays.  You do have to wait to be seated even though they don't have a sign anywhere and it doesn't feel like that kind of restaurant.  Overall, good food and a nice place to hang out and chat with a friend."}
{"text":"Very good breakfast.  GF had the eggs benedict and said is was good. I had the western skillet with a biscuit and gravy. Skillet very tasty,gravy on the biscuit tasted like it had lemon in it. Over all a nice meal. Thanks."}
{"text":"First time I came was beginning of EDC week this past year 'nd after driving all night to get to Vegas early morning all I wanted was some good breakfast and a comfy bed to sleep on to get the day started. So on our drive I looked up some mom and pop breakfast places because  I didn't want the typical Denny's or IHop. We got here exactly as they opened and were one of the first in 'nd the waitress was super attentive. Great personality and even at 8am was giving us great service. Told her we had never been, recommended a few things 'nd overall everything was beyond great! Definitely thought to myself, next time I come back to Vegas, I'm going to have breakfast here.  Fast forward to today, I stopped by again because it was that good the first time. And tried something different than the first time 'nd again beyond expectations. I HIGHLY recommend to go here. Great service, amazing food 'nd this time we weren't the first ones here 'nd came probably during their peak hours 'nd still only waited 5 minutes to get a table."}
{"text":"Tried a new breakfast place....wasn't impressed.  Here are the pluses:  The wait to get a table was quick.   The wait staff were courteous and attentive.  Ok, now the negatives:  The coffee was lukewarm and bland.  The wait for the food was over 20 minutes.  The food was subpar.  I had to send my waffle back, because it was far from cooked through.  It looked like it was on the waffle iron for 60 seconds.  The bacon..one slice was almost burnt and the other still \"oinking\".  The biscuits and gravy were a nice portion (the half order) but the gravy was too salty for my liking.  Again, the food was lukewarm at best.  I was also concerned that the soap in the bathroom had been watered down.  Are the owners so cheap they would risk staff and customers not having proper soap?  Won't be back.  :/"}
{"text":"Great food, great service. I realize it was mid week but I was one of three tables. We need to support local gems like this or we will be stuck earing at chains and being told how to eat a \"happy meal\""}
{"text":"I really like this place!!   I walked in and was greeted by this very nice young woman. She sat me and asked what I wanted to drink, like any restaurant. I asked her what she recommended and she told me she generally likes sweeter stuff, so she normally gets pancakes after every shift, then asked if I like sweeter stuff.   Normally, I'd jump all over some pancakes, but I thought I was super hungry. So I told her I was hungry for more than pancakes. She then recommended the hobo skillet.   Grilled onions, cheese, chopped up sausage links, served over potatoes.   YES PLEASE.  Eggs come with it too, and I'm boring when it comes to eggs. Scrambled every time.  Every. Single. Time.   Anyway, I waited about ten minutes, give or take a few minutes, which is fine, I expected that.   The manager or owner or whoever he was brought my skillet out, and it was sizzling and popping and I was trying to contain my drool. Oh, it also comes with toast. So, when I saw all of this food I knew I was in trouble. It was  waaaaay more than I could have eaten. So I start nibbling, it's really hot, which I like obviously. My toast came pre buttered which is fine, I like grape jelly and butter on my toast anyway :).   But then, I was drinking some of my milk, and I got pretty low, and it wasn't until then that I noticed there was a label on my cup. So I turned it around, just curious as to what it was.   Gold peak tea mason jar. Cute.  But the tea that was stuck to the glass and wasn't cleaned properly wasn't cute. At all.   Owner/manager/whoever dude walked by and I asked him for a new glass. He apologized as he saw what was wrong with it, and hurried back with a full non-gold peak tea glass of milk. Which was great and all. But it kind of made me question the cleanliness of the rest of the dishes.   I work in the food service industry, I know all about bacteria growth and what not.  In short: Food was great.  Service was great. Wash your dishes a little better, and it would be 5 stars.   I plan on coming back this Saturday so we'll see how great their flap jacks are."}
{"text":"Today was our first time here. I ate way to much. They were very nice. I have a special needs daughter and they really made her feel at home. The seating area is small but it really worked well. This place will be at the top of my list for family eating."}
{"text":"Looking for a new place to brunch,  stopped in on a midweek afternoon. Service was decent, food was adequate.  I wish there wasn't chocolate sauce drizzled on the red velvet pancake. And the biscuit and gravy was not what I expected, or am used to (kind of a flat biscuit swimming in gravy) but edible. There are books available to read, not a lot of seating.   I may go back eventually but not immediately. The service was better than the food."}
{"text":"nothing special my oatcakes were okay service good always crowed"}
{"text":"Went to Vegas with the wife and her uncle recommended a place called Griddlecakes...not really a fan of breakfast I'm more into lunch. So decided to try it since the wife was craving some waffles. She ordered chicken waffle and they suggested to try the waffle churro at first I was like whaaatttttttttt!!!!!!!!!! There's no way that's possible so she order it and I was like OMG that was dankkkkkkkkkkk. And for me tried the Pina colada pankcake and dammmmmmmmm that blew my mind... can't wait to come back to Vegas..."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, its literally your dream come true for breakfast. The staff is really friendly and always on point. Best pancakes in vegas! Highly recommended"}
{"text":"I walked into this place about mid week not expecting to really be surprised but I definently was. This reminds me of the mom and pop shops we used to have back home and it definently was an awesome experience. I will def have to come back and bring the whole family. The staff here is pretty awesome, they are attentive and come around before my coffee was even close to being done. The pancakes were pretty amazing in my opinion (very fresh) but beyond else it provided me with a taste of home. Great food, great staff, great people ! what else can you ask for !"}
{"text":"This place has changed to Stacks and Yolks so we decided to give it another try. What a change!!! Food was great. Service was great. Food was a little slow coming out because there was a car show but worth the wait. Definitely worth another look if you've been to previous restaurant."}
{"text":"The vibe in here was a little off, it felt tense. My waitress, the only one never greeted me or told me her name. She just said can I take your order. My eggs and bacon came up and they sat there instead of being served while they're hot she chose to add up some tickets and wait for my pancakes. The eggs were very good, they were scrambled just right good flavor pity they were now room temperature, I would have enjoyed them more hot. The pancakes were dense doughy like and I could taste some of the lemon, not the blueberry, they had a spoonful of blueberry preserve on them. No matter how much syrup they were still kinda hard to eat because of the density. Overall not super friendly environment.  The waitress and other staff discussed how the owner only hires young girls only, that's not something that the public needs to know. This was a one time visit for me, despite the great eggs everything else is sort of off"}
{"text":"Overview:  It was a Saturday morning on Labor Day weekend and all the Breakfast spots were packed.  We went from full parking lot to full parking lot till we got to the Denny's on Eastern.  Yes, I'll admit it, I eat at Denny's.  When you've worked a 12 hour night shift at the hospital, sometimes you just want some greasy stuff piled up high on your plate with some pan cakes and syrup.  Since the Denny's on Eastern was also full, we drove by wondering where we should try next when we spotted The Griddles sign and pulled in.  Location:  Get off on the 215 at Eastern heading south.  It will be on the Left a bit past Denny's and the gas station.    Exterior:  This place is small with a few tables outside.  You could almost miss it.  Interior:  There are booths on both walls and high tables and stools down the middle.  Nothing Fancy here.  Very bare bones.  Service:  We were given immediate service and our food and drinks came out very quickly.  I did not take the time to check my tab as others have suggested.  Maybe next time I'll take the time to do so just to see.  The price didn't seem out of control, so I assume they got it right.  Food:  Your standard American breakfast affair.  Not the hardest thing in the world to cook up.  They got eggs, meats, pan cakes, and the standard guest.  I was happy to see real fresh squeezed orange juice.  It wasn't that American cheese orange of your store juice.  This was a deeper orange with bits of pulp floating on top.  The taste was a bit tart, but like biting into an orange.  If it's not fresh, then I need to ask them what brand it is, cause its good.  My choice that morning was chicken fried steak.  Their version comes with the white gravy, a pile of potato cubes (home fries), eggs made to order, and toast.  It didn't seem like a lot, but it was very filling and satisfied my breakfast cravings.  Taste wise, it was okay.  The chicken fried steak was average, the gravy didn't blow me away, the home fries were equally adequate, and my toast was burnt.    Summary:  Overall an average breakfast spot.  I've actually ate better at an Ihop or Denny's.  Service was speedy and the bill was very reasonable.  Great Orange Juice, okay food.  The fact that I didn't have to wait to be seated or have a problem finding a parking spot was the bright spot.  That in and of itself pushed me up to 4 stars."}
{"text":"I am surprised by all the 5 star reviews. Went here for lunch, although I ordered breakfast food, and it was decent but not great. Too expensive for what amounts to diner food. Probably will not return."}
{"text":"Been here on several occasions.... this time was very bad to say the least. I ordered the Grilled chicken & eggs, Chicken came out pink inside, eggs were cold and muffin was coming out after. I asked the waitress to take back the undercooked chicken and she looked at me crazy, and then I asked if she could at least leave the eggs so they didn't get cold, she thought that wasn't normal either. She finally brought me back a plate to take the eggs off and took back the exact same piece of chicken to cook it after I had already sliced it. Health code states that you must re-cook a fresh piece of food and discard the one that she took back from the customer. So this was already a violation of health code, but I really don't think they care. Oh and yes the waitress never said her name and just said can I take your order, she could not keep up with the tables. Coffee cup remained empty for over 10 minutes and nobody bothered to see if we needed more of anything. She then got me an iced tea and never gave me a straw with it, when I finally asked for one she gave me one with an end that was already open. This place is a joke and I will never go there again and waste my money. It's very obvious there isn't some sort of standard of anything!  They have not closed the name changed to Stacks n Yolks!"}
{"text":"I've honestly haven't had a bad experience here. The first time I came here, I ordered the white chocolate raspberry pancakes and they were delicious! The raspberry drizzle definitely stole the show. The pancake of course was also soft and fluffy.   The second time I went here, I went for the protein oatmeal pancakes with bananas, pecans, and cinnamon. I can't remember the name of the pancake but it was awesome! You don't have to compromise your diet as much. These pancakes were delicious and it reminded me of oatmeal cookies without the raisins! Which I fell in love with instantly. I love how a simple pancake can taste so yummy. Oh and I ordered the raspberry drizzle on the side cause why not?   Apart from the yummy pancakes, the service is great! Nick is clearly a sweetheart and what seems to be either the owner or the manager here, was awesome as well. It was busy during this Sunday afternoon and he was helping out the waiters and waitresses. He also cracked a few jokes at our table. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Traditional eggs Benedict. it came out very quickly. The hollandaise sauce lacks traditional taste and actually had a very odd taste. not sure what the odd taste was but it was odd. i requested the hash browns extra crispy which only came out crispy on one side and wasn't even cooked on the bottom so they were basically half cooked and mushy in the middle. yuck! i could only choke down half the plate. the coffee is pretty bitter as well. 1 star and that's being generous."}
{"text":"I woke up mid-morning and was in the mood for some breakfast-y food so I luckily came across this place and decided to try it out.  I was pleasantly surprised about the portions - you get what you pay for & you'll be able to have enough to take as left overs home. It's a cute american style breakfast/lunch spot and is open until 3pm every day. I wasn't able to take a picture of the menu but they have quite a selection & you can add or substitute with no issues. If you're not in the mood for a big breakfast, they have oatmeal and parfait options as well as a gluten free section which I thought was pretty neat.  The staff is friendly and very attentive. It's kid friendly, providing high chairs/booster seats as well as a kids section on the menu. From the looks of it, you can fit some big parties too since there's already tables put together and then there's booths in the middle of the restaurant.  The only reason why I didn't rate it 5 stars is bc of how warm it is inside. I overheard that some parts of the day the temperature can vary so maybe next time I'll go in earlier but they do have a lot of fans and our waitress did address how warm it was even though it wasn't so much of an issue to us. As a first timer 4 stars should be reassuring, so definitely try it out!"}
{"text":"Good food, good service. It is especially nice to have the great toppings for the pancakes."}
{"text":"My family and I would've really enjoyed to eat here but unfortunately we wasn't important enough to get serviced. My husband told the young lady at the front he wanted to order to go and she didn't even acknowledge him. Other customers who were in line even felt what she did was rude being that everyone else was serviced before him yet they was there after him.   Unfortunately my family and I did feel discriminated against being that we were the only minorities in that place of business.    Honestly, we're just a hard working family who wanted to enjoy some breakfast on our off day I do not understand the harm in that."}
{"text":"Came to grab some breakfast since searching on yelp and saw this place got four stars. It's tucked away in a corner next to one of my past go to Thai places for lunch Panna Thai.   There was a hostess in the front to greet you as you walked in the door which was nice considering how busy they were. The place was pretty small and they ran out of high chairs so we had to make do with putting two chairs together for the baby's car seat.   The menu wasn't too extensive and it helps to look at other reviews on yelp. We ordered the  Monkey business and Chorizo scramble.   I personally love anything with peanut butter. Sadly was disappointed when I tried the monkey business. The pancakes were a bit dense and I felt like I had to add a ton of syrup because they were missing the peanut butter flavor. The chorizo scramble was better than the pancakes. The flavors of the chorizo was good and I thought that dish was very tasty.   Overall, the service was good and towards the end the staff was more attentive to us which was nice. I would try other things than the pancakes though."}
