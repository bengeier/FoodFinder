{"text":"Amazing!  Tacos Trafi catered our son's graduation party and I can't say enough good things... great customer service, prompt and super friendly staff, and the food was just delicious!  Everyone raved about the tacos (carne asada, chicken, and el pastor... a favorite)!  I highly recommend Tacos Trafi and I know we will use them again in the future.  Thank you Maydolin, Johnny, and Oscar for making our party such a great success!"}
{"text":"I hired Tacos Trafi to cater my wedding last month and I could not have made a better decision, I had encountered their wonderful food at a few events around town in the past, so I thought I'd reach out since our wedding was \"Fiesta Themed.\" Oscar was quick to respond and even though he already had another event booked on the date, he expalined how honored they were to be offered the opportunity and would break off part of the team to handle our wedding.

From the planning of the event, to the delivery of the food on the night of, they were completely professional in every way. Our guests, many of which came from out of town and can never get authentic tacos, talked for days afterwards about how amazing the food was and how friendly the staff was. I can't thank them enough for making our night perfect! I would strongly recommend their services for any event!"}
{"text":"We researched multiple companies for street tacos and found Tacos Trafi to have the best pricing and reviews.  This event was a post nup party for 80 plus people in our back yard.  They set up two hours ahead, smell was amazing while cooking everything fresh.  The grilled carmalized onions and jalapenos were phenomenal.  All 3 meats had great flavor and the Al Pastor went the fastest and had the best seasoning I have tasted.  Oscar, the owner, was so professional and made us feel like like it was our day.  They served for 2 hours, packed up the left overs and left them for us.  All of our guests said the food was terrific and I will only use them for future events.  Thank you Tacos Trafi for a fabulous menu, great pricing and 150% plus professionalism. Megan & Clay Condra..."}

{"text":"I would give Tacos Trafi a gazillion stars if that were an option.  The food was AMAZING!!!!!!!  I happened to stumble across Tacos Trafii on Yelp when looking for someone to cater my daughter's graduation party.  I can't tell you how happy I am to have found these wonderful people.  They made it so easy - Maydolin was super helpful when trying to figure out what and how much I needed for the party.  Then when the party came around, Oscar and Johnny (I hope I spelled that right)  show up right on time, set up everything perfectly, and make the most scrumptious tacos, beans and rice ever - all the guests were raving!  If you are looking for a Taco Catering place for your party or event, look no further - these guys are the best!  Thank you guys for making our party such a hit!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious and the customer service is excellent!
I planned a wedding reception for 100 people in about about a months time. The website they have to order the food was very easy to use. They were also willing to work with me as far as scheduling payments goes which made it less stressful on me. 
They are excellent communicators and very good about answering every question. They even went so far as asking me what the color theme was so they could coordinate with the party. 
My vision for throwing a party was for me not to do any cooking and they went beyond my expectations and even packaged the leftovers for me so I didn't even have to worry about clean up!
The price was pretty good considering the tasty food they cooked and all my guests loved it.
They even include napkins, plates, cups, cutlery so you don't have to worry about it.
They made a highly stressful event so easy going and smooth! They all were very professional, friendly and outgoing. I highly recommend this company to anyone needing a caterer for a private or public event. The work ethic in this company is awesome! Thank you Tacos Trafi for making my special day stress free!"}
{"text":"I had catering for my sons 1st birthday party. The taqueros were very polite, professional, on time. I'll be honest at first I was worried about finding a catering (taquero) online, I had half of my bill online and was worried they wouldn't show up. They arrived 10 minutes before. They are very clean, wore gloves, salsas are in container squirt bottles. They don't get all over the place. They set their own tables very nicely. They do serve alot of meat on your tacos, that's a bonus if you like a lot of meat. The food was good. All well put together. I couldn't have chosen a better catering business. I hope they do this business for a long time because I would definitely hire them again. 2 more things to add, the price was decent and they drove more then an hour to were I live. Thank you tacos  tafi"}
