{"text":"I was surprised that we were able to get a patio table on a Hot sunny Friday afternoon with no wait. Now I understand why. Slow service, bored staff, mediocre food and an over all unpleasant experience. It's burgers and salad...! How do you mess that up? Apparently you can. You're better off dining on street food."}
{"text":"Uncooked chicken wings . A couple of us got some chicken wings and after eating about 4 we noticed that the chicken was not cooked. They charged us for it saying that we ate enough that we should be paying for all. They neglected to address the fact that the chicken was not cooked and pink inside.  There are plenty of options across the street..... Avoid this place."}
{"text":"Sub-par, even for a crappy chain restaurant. Super-heady, warm beer, generic, flavourless food, poor service. Also no air conditioning on a hot day. Laaaaame."}
{"text":"Came for lunch on March break with my mom and 2 kids.   Where to start?   Overpriced, lousy service, 40 minute wait for terrible food.   Shoulda went to Jack Astors. Hard to screw up road house food. Oh yeah. The waitress disappeared for many minutes without bothering with the dessert that came with the kids meals. Never did get them.   First and last visit"}
{"text":"Decent food, awesome service...Nicole was our server and did awesome.  We had 9 of us in total with three children 4 and under.  Food came out in a timely manner, only hiccup was the kronuts that got messed up but it was a minor mistake and was taken care of quickly. Loved how everyone helped out ie. Bartender would run drinks, greeter ran food and helped clear table.  Definitely will be back next time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"I went with a large group on a Friday night. My bias lies in that I usually don't like to eat at chain restaurants, however my expectations were low so I guess there was room to be pleasantly delighted. There was plenty of room for us. Service was good. The burgers looked terrible, and from what I hear they were about as bad as they looked, my boyfriend was irritated that his fries and burger weren't warm enough. I had the ribs, which exceeded my expectations and sadly were better than the ribs I've had at higher end restaurants elsewhere in Toronto. The portions are huge.  I wouldn't go back again, but that's because there's so many other restaurants to try. If I were taken to this restaurant, I would happily order the ribs again."}
{"text":"Just awful. The veggie burger I ordered was gross but I ate it because I was hungry. I shouldn't have because now I have food poisoning from it - neither my daughter nor my spouse got it and everything else we ate yesterday was the same. So it had to have been that burger.   My daughter asked for more crayons - they only gave her a red one - and she was basically ignored despite her father asking again. I didn't touch my salad - it was very sad looking, and the service was just terrible. Too  bad as I used to really like this place once upon a time.  The two stars are for the location and patio. It's a decent place for people watching and in a convenient location close to many tourist attractions and Union Station."}
{"text":"It's around the corner from the ACC and we went for a bite to eat before a Leafs game.  Seemed like every other customer was there for the same thing.     Food wasn't good.  I ordered a burger that was heavy, greasy (the bread had that greasy-shine of a just-unwrapped McDonald's burger).   My buddy ordered wings.  The menu says wings come in 7 different flavours...but doesn't say what those flavours are.   But, our other option was food at the ACC, so this was probably better.  Service was very good.  Waiter named Andre was friendly, prompt, and had an eye for detail (noticed to bring an extra coaster, offered to bring our bill early in case we were rushing to the game, etc).  Hostess was also very friendly and helpful.    The only reason to go is to grab a bite and a pint before an event at the ACC, and it's good for that."}
{"text":"Went to Casey's for lunch a few weeks ago and ordered a chicken SANDWICH. the place was nearly empty, but still it took forever for my sandwich to arrive. finally i got my sandwich. it came with fork and knife and NO TOP BUN !!! personally i prefer to eat my sandwiches with my hands - not fork & knife ... so when i asked the waiter if i could possibly have the top part of my sandwich bun he lectured me that he can't do that because that's the way it's being done here bla bla ... i even offered to pay for the missing bun, but he refused !!!  i have NEVER come across such a level of inflexibility and non-customer focus ... even weeks after the incident i am still shaking my head every time i walk by Casey's ...."}
{"text":"I think this is the first time I have been to Casey's. I don't know if it was because there was a concert here tonight that there were this many people for dinner on a Thursday night or this is just how it is here in downtown restaurants after work. My friends were already there waiting there for 45 minutes before they got a table, I left work late so once I got there, they just got the table.  We needed something quick so I got a Bison burger - with brie cheese, fried apple, onions, apple beer BBQ sauce and lettuce. The fries were so good, crispy hot, so hard to stop. The burger was good, though honestly I can't tell between bison vs beef. But it was filling... could hardly finish at the end and we didn't even had any appetizers."}
{"text":"Super slow service.   Out of the eight diners at our table, only two got their orders served as requested Two people ordered a premium beer, were given what tasted and looked like Miller, and when they questioned what was brought they were told \" that is what this beer tastes like\". Give me a break.  Although the food tasted good, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Casey's has always been a favorite of mine and I was sad when my Mississauga one closed. Working downtown now - decided to try it... twice in fact.  Every time I had an excellent experience. Once was for lunch (hence not as packed) and once on a Friday evening (when it was packed). Both times we got seats relatively fast and the service was not bad.  Great food - I love the jambalaya (I would have to say it is better than Big Daddy's Bourbon Grill up on King - although that one is specialized creole). Gf had the calamari and she was happy as well. On both occasions we were happy with the food choice.  Atmosphere is your general family restaurant - Kelsey's or Appleby's type of feeling. Usually good people in there during weekdays given the downtown location, can be a bit tacky when you have Jays/Raptors/Leafs game on. That is the time to generally avoid the place - crammed with extremely loud and obnoxious sports fans - most of them quite drunk. At that point, indeed you have to wait for a table for a while and service would be slow.   Give it a try when it's not a sports event. The experience should be vastly superior. Still loving Casey's and will come back..."}
{"text":"Had their cheeseburger, was dry and tasteless.  Ordered the Alexander Keith ipa, did not taste like an ipa at all, pretty tasteless.  Was told that it was a Canadian ipa.  Should have sent it back, but didn't.  They took it off the bill though which was nice."}
{"text":"Wed nights in the summer love music on the patio and 5$ beer, thu they have 4$ drinks almost any thing from wine beer to cocktails and spirits. Food isn't that good but a nice dt bar if ur in town or getting off work, always a deal, again food isn't that food but service is friendly"}
{"text":"Came here because we had 2 little kids with us they needed food asap or else a melt down was going to happen.  Server forgot we were her table.....she did apologize.  Then the food was just....very mediocre.  Had the Thai noodle salad - there's barely any noodle in it and it's drenched with dressing.  I had low expectations coming in and nothing horrible and nothing fantastic happened.  Wouldn't be back for the food - but the location is prime, next to Union station and the ACC."}
{"text":"First time went there was Monday night. Only ordered a few drinks, service was OK. Went on Thursday night for $4 drinks. Service was horrible. Drink was good. Tried their wings, not bad. Not a bad place to hang out after dinner."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend after an event at Steam Whistle.   Food: We sat for more than ten minutes before we were even asked if we wnted to order food. Once our waiter finally walked by, we asked to order food, in which he told use to hold on cause he was greeting other guests at the door. So they were clearly short/under staffed since the server was also doing host duties which took away from our level of service.  Um rude!!!!! When he finally came back, we ordered the shrimp tacos & fried pickles. Everything was just OK. ...the one thing I could appreciate was that the breading was \"real\" and not like sime sort of panko batter.   Service: Brutal!!!! Tuesday night and was not even busy. We sat on the bar side and there was only one other customer, an older gentleman who had the one waitress working sit down on the job and have a drink with him. She then proceed  to lean completely over the bar for an ass showing to her customer. (what seemed like a shameless attempt at getting a bigger tip) This went on for a good ten minutes. During our whole meal, no one even once came over to ask how things were. Only at the end when paying our bill did our waiter even speak more than 3 words to me.  Return??? Not sure...but highly unlikely/doubtful."}
{"text":"Casey's wasn't our first choice for pre-game dinner and drinks but we're glad it was our second. After a hard day at work a fresh pitcher of Okanagan hit the spot, as did a delicious bacon and cheese burger, turkey burger, sweet potato fries and the house salad. The price was reasonable and the service sound. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Hmm, where do I begin. My friends and I had been exercising around Harbourfront and had a craving for bar food. Reasons Casey's sucked that day:  1. The wait: It took an hour to get our food. We stopped one waiter to ask him about it and he said that they were short staffed as they're never really busy on a long weekend (huh?). When our waiter, Andre, eventually came out, he said the wait was because the kitchen was being \"tested\". Yeah, EXACTLY what I want to hear when my food is coming out of there!  2. The mix-up: My friend ordered chicken strips, I ordered quesadillas and another friend said he would \"have the same\". In that exact order. Andre brought out chicken strips, quesadillas and...buffalo wings. When my friend pointed out that he had not ordered buffalo wings, Andre let him know that it may take awhile due to issue #1 and if my friend would want to change his order to buffalo wings. My friend said no. Ironically, my friend's order came out 20 minutes later. So the food shouldn't actually take an hour!  3. The make-up: After we had finished our meal and watched our friend eat his, a gentleman came over and asked if we wanted dessert. We said no thank you. He asked if we were sure. We again repeated the no. He then said, \"even if it's on me?\" We all paused and then agreed to the dessert. After he left and we all exchanged stories, I realize that we all paused for the same reason. From the way he asked the question, it sounded extremely sexual and freaked all of us out. When he came back, we had one piece of cake..to share amongst each other. Normally that would've been okay, but we were all going to our respective houses.  4. Awkward moment: After we were sexually solicited with cake, Andre came back over to ask us if we spoke to Alejandro, the manager. We realized that that was his name (he never introduced himself). He asked us if we didn't mind telling him what Alejandro wanted. He seemed visibly relieved that he offered us cake. Maybe Andre had thought he would've been fired. We weren't sure since by then, we just wanted to get out of there.  5. The bill: Two people paying debit. I paid cash. He opened the bill wallet to see I had put my money in there and then said we could all follow him to the debit machine. Andre proceeded to ask each of my friend's the amount of their bill (instead of just looking at them). After my friends had paid, he started to say his goodbyes. I sighed and asked for my change. He said, \"oh yeah, you paid cash! My bad!\". He then asked me the amount of my bill. I told him to check himself (I was annoyed by then). He then started to count out the difference in quarters. I couldn't stand in there another minute and simply asked for a $5 back and left."}
{"text":"Friendly and kind servers. I ordered the Mini Peanut Butter Brownie Sundae. It was the best Sundae i've ever had. I might even come back just for that. Their poutine is not so good, it almost tastes raw. I'm not a huge fan of the atmosphere of the restaurant but it's a good place to go after a Jays/Raptors/Leafs game. Good location."}
{"text":"Went to Casey's with little expectations. We were going to sit in patio but it was a bit chilly and decided to sit inside. There was a retirement party going on so the hostess was nice enough to sit us far from the action and noise.  The waiter was very attentive and recommended a few dishes as well as drink specials.  I ended up ordering the beef ribs which were excellent and a descent portion. By the end of it, there was no room for dessert and had some leftovers for another meal.   Overall, a good experience and definitely will try the patio once the weather cooperates. They also have daily food and drink specials throughout the week and is closeby to many sporting venues like ACC and Rogers Centre."}
{"text":"Casey's sucks.  My friend and I went there the other night and we didn't find a reason to go back. My friend ordered quesadillas only to be told that they didn't have any that night. WTF?!  Also, our waitress did the basic minimum of her job. She did not tell us her name or ask how we were. She was not the least bit engaging. The food was meh. I ordered a steak wrap which comes with fries OR salad. My waitress did not bother asking me which side I wanted. I wanted fries and that's what they gave me, but they did not ask me what I wanted. Plus, my food was on an ugly green plate. UGH!!!  I also don't much care for the atmosphere.  Do not waste your time or money here. All other expensive restaurants I have been to are better than this. If you want to enjoy yourself, go to Shark Club."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to grab some pre-game grub and drinks prior to the Toronto Rock Lacrosse finals.  Thankfully beating the dinner patrons, we headed straight for the bar where we found a table perfect for us.  After getting the attention of our waitress immediately due to only arriving 50mins prior to game time we both ordered two pints of the Somersby Cider.... (i dont consider it beer lol) For food we decided to order their shareable Spinach/ artichoke dish with pita and tortilla chips.  The presentation was nice, and the cheese dip was okay. The somersby being light, however with too much ice in it was still an enjoyable quencher.   Overall, our server was a delight with smiles, and was always checking up on us...however it was a bit slow...  This is my first time to this Casey's location, and so far it seems like a great place to hang out.  I'd definitely take advantage of their patio as its spacious and right on the corner of York and Front....location location location...."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has such a low rating. I would imagine during very big events like a Leafs game it's probably not the quickest service. I went with my sisters just before a Jays game was to take place and I could see a lot of Bautista jerseys in the building, but we were sat down in a great booth immediately and our waitress was over in minutes to tell us specials and take drink orders.  During the course of the evening the game had started and the place quickly emptied out, but even with the bustle earlier I never found things too loud or hectic in the slightest. I ordered a simple burger with caesar salad and I thought both were equally delicious and satisfying. My sisters got fries with their burgers and they came in a rather quite little metal container that looked like a mini shopping cart.  Only complaint was that once the restaurant lightened up capacity-wise the service slowed down a little. The waitress came by less often and even forgot our second drink orders -- but I can forgive this because she was more than friendly and on-point up until then. The bill came and the prices were reasonable.   I would come back again for sure, especially considering there's not really much to choose from in the sports district. And even though they do have sports on several televisions (some pretty old school tube TVs except by the bar) it didn't feel like a severe jock gathering."}
{"text":"I was here for a late lunch on Sunday, and the place wasn't packed.  The food was actually decent: - stack sandwich - it had grilled chicken, bacon, fresh apple slice, and more; an interesting and refreshing combo of taste; add $2 to switch for the sweet potato fries wasn't really worth it.  they don't give you a lot... - Grilled shrimp and calamari appetizer - the grilled shrimp was good!"}
{"text":"Cheap Keiths' on Fridays ($6) but too bad when I walked up for the host&hostess to seat me they said I could sit but nobody took my order. Ended up waiting for a few minutes before having to walk inside and get it myself from the bar. The host&hostess still just hung around chatting.. Not sure if they're supposed to inform servers but I was not pleased with the service here at all. I did see a guy around but I already had the one beer that I came in for.. whatev.. disappointed."}
{"text":"There is a reason four of us were able to get a table for dinner on a Friday Raptors game night.   It is because it is pretty bad.    Suk and I took two of our nephews to the Raptors game this past Friday.  Looking to grab dinner first, we were turned away from Jacks and the Loose Moose but had no problem securing a table at Caseys.  That should have been our first clue.   My youngest nephew ordered from the kids menu and had tomato sauce pasta, which was definitively the best of the four.  I ordered the cheese artichoke dip, Suk had wings and our other nephew had a cheese burger.     The wings, although ordered hot, really had no heat to them although they smelled like Frank's hot sauce.   Nephews burger was DRY and hard as a puck.  My cheese dip (who orders cheese dip as a main? I do) was cold and although it was brought back to be nuked in the microwave, it cooled rapidly when it was returned and only tasted of sour cream.      Service was friendly but not awesome, which is totally okay as it was busy-ish for the game night.    This may be a place I come back to to grab some drinks on the patio but I will never order food from here again.  You may not want to either."}
{"text":"Before watching the raptors game me and my buddy pre-game dinner, Casey's was it. Let me tell you, it was not good. The service was crap and the greeter didn't look too happy working there. Our waitress was speaking way too fast and couldn't understand what the special was. And....the menu did not have anything on there that would stand out from the rest of their competition.  I ended up choosing the butchers block burger and my friend got the steak sandwich. Gotta give them bonus points for speedy delivery, but the meal was mediocre. I would've been happier with a happy meal. It was a 12 dollar meal worth 5 bux.  Despite the meal not being very good, the place was nice and clean and had lots of tv which kept us entertained. But not good enough to keep me as a customer."}
{"text":"Had dinner before the Leaf's game last week!  The restaurant was totally packed!  Took a client and we ordered the spinach dip as an app.  Nice and warm and very satisfying!  My friend ordered a steak with baked potato and I ordered the ribs & wing platter!  Came out exactly as anticipated.  Lots of food and very satisfying!"}
{"text":"2.5/5, +.5 for service  Honestly I didn't expect much coming here. I know the area within a 500 metre radius of Union Station is somewhat void in terms of good restaurants, but I needed somewhere close by (and without waiting time) as I had a concert to attend nearby.  Coming in here with my friend, the place was only about half full for 7pm on a Saturday, though there was a hockey game on. We were taken care of quite promptly and had a quite energetic waitress who served us, which was quite nice.  I ordered the 8oz sirloin topped with mushrooms, blue cheese and peppercorn sauce, with caesar salad. It took a while to come, but overall the food was about what I expected: Nothing special. The cheese for caesar salad didn't really melt properly, and the garlic bread was quite hard. The mushrooms and blue cheese were very good and the steak was cooked exactly the way I expected, but you can tell the quality is about what you expect for a chain restaurant and not a true steakhouse.  Maybe Jack Astor's would be better? But I know that particular one across the street is always busy on weekends. Wish there were more options around Union Station."}
{"text":"Dear Casey's,  Why are your portions humongous? An appetizer should be small enough to precede a meal, not be substantial enough to feed two people.  After I had half of an appetizer, I waddled home unattractively.  Sincerely, Please don't make me fat"}
{"text":"Oh Casey's...  Service - you wait long enough to get seriously hungry.  Portions - when they finally bring it, seems like you'll need two of those to kill that hunger.  Food - may be a revelation for those who only have been to McDonald's or KFC so far. For the rest of us there is nothing to talk about.  Drinks - I dunno, they call it \"bar and grill\", but there is even less to a bar, than to a grill. Maybe I've skipped something important, but if plain Molson is good enough for you, you should be good enough for Casey's.  And beyond that all a marvellous \"no hi, no bye, no thank you\" attitude makes you feel like you've missed the door when entering.  And just think that I've been to different Casey's at least three times! That's tough, eh..."}
{"text":"Nice bar and diner. The food was good. Good teast. Had a full rack back ribs with the mild sauce; good! We sir at the bar. The girls behind the bar seem to have a bad day. No smiles at all. Is there something wrong in town. Strange way to serve. Oh, the music was oké and the number \"Welcome to the Jungle\" made a lot good. Resumé: food is good."}
{"text":"If it wasn't for the server this would get no stars. The bartender was rude when I asked  if we should seat ourselves after standing at the host desk for 10 mins. The service by Vanessa was wobderful but the kitchen was slow as snails.  Jack Astors was by far the better choice."}
{"text":"Oh Casey's...you used to be so good. You kinda suck now.  I went to Casey's on Front before a concert since all the restaurants around were jam packed.  They said it'd be about 30 mins for a table and it was actually about 15 mins so that was a nice bonus.   Our waitress was fantastic, don't get me wrong. The low rating was not on service. Even though it was busy as heck in there, she didn't forget about us and was very upbeat and friendly.  My problem was with their shitty burger. Sorry, but that's the only way to describe it. It seems their menu has shrunk as well. It didn't take me long to decide what to get since they really didn't have much to choose from. Back in the early 90's, I LOVED Casey's burgers. Of course, this was when you could still choose how you wanted it cooked.  The cheeseburger I got was like a dry, brown puck of blah. The fries were meh. I was disappointed, to say the least. I probably won't visit a Casey's again for awhile. It's really too bad, I used to love this place."}
{"text":"Best chicken tacos I have ever tried in my life!!! So good!  Will definitely come back here again.  Fiancée got fish & chips. He loved it too.  Great place to go before the raps game!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place got such bad reviews... but maybe I just haven't come here enough?  I came here last night to meet my gf before the Leaf's game at ACC.  I waited at the bar, where I grabbed a beer and was served quickly.  They told me it would be a 30 minute wait until I was seated, but it only about 20 minutes... so that was good.  They asked me if I wanted a refill on my beer about 10 times!  Can you say peer pressure!  Haha, I knew that once I got my food I would stop drinking, so that's why I didn't get another one.    The food I ordered was amazing, but maybe its because I was extremely hungry.  I had the short rib pasta, and my gf got the burger.  Burger wasn't too good, I'd rate it a 6/10.    All in all, I have nothing bad to say about this place.  It was packed with Leaf fans, and emptied out close to 7pm before the game started.  But the place was a bit dark and drab.  Not the best atmosphere... Jack Astor's is much nicer inside.  Interior decor is what drops this place a star rating..."}
{"text":"Casey's was the perfect sports bar for a quick and satisfying meal before the Yankees @ Blue Jays game. The atmosphere and menu reminded me of a Tully's or T.G.I. Fridays. They serve typical sports bar fare: apps, burgers, ribs and sandwiches.  Their specialty is BBQ ribs, which were okay, a little charred for my liking. I also enjoyed the burger, but I thought their appetizers were much better. My favorite dish was the spinach dip served with pita and tortilla chips. It was cheesy and delicious!  I went with a group of six people. We sat down, had appetizers and entrees and paid the bill in less than one hour.  I wouldn't recommend this place for a date or meaningful occasion, but it was a fun place to stop for a beer and speedy meal!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times and have always been happy with the service My favourite is the red pepper soup for starters. Perfectly balanced flavours and texture.  The one time my wife had a problem with bad fish the manager was very apologetic, comp'ed her meal (she'd ordered something else) and our drinks. Then sent us a gift card in the mail as a further gesture of goodwill which certainly encouraged us to go back.  When there's events at the ACC and/or Rogers Centre they won't take reservations and so it can be difficult and a long wait to get a table. Other than that, it's a great place for a drink and bite to eat."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and layout. Went in because I had a $15 off card. Had a steak and shrimp that were above average. My Manhattan was not made properly, but that may be a Canada thing. There is a lot of tourist traffic, which can mean the food is not a priority."}
