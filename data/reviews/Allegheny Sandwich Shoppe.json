{"text":"This is a cozy place that feels very local, but was extremely welcoming to us and our young (~2) daughter.  There weren't any tables available when we arrived but they noticed us right away and let us know a good place to wait.  They gave our daughter crackers to keep her entertained for the couple minutes until a table was available.  The food was very tasty, came in good time and was very affordable.  There wasn't a kids menu but they had grilled cheese which works just fine for us.  I had the Italian sub and my wife had the Dagwood, both excellent.  We are really glad we found this place after visiting the National Aviary (less than a mile away) and would definitely recommend it. :)"}
{"text":"A lot of places claim to be the 'best breakfast in town', so I passed this one too many times. This is perfect home cooking on the run, with fresh bread, farm fresh eggs, and ingredients. It's not the fancy bunch spot with the fancy price tag, but it is affordable real food. Daily soups (3) are also very good. Chowder is very creamy and less clamy."}
{"text":"Yum!  You know when it's lunchtime and you are looking for the perfect kind of regular joe diner type experience? Nothing fancy but solid eats at a decent price? You've found it!   This place is exactly what it looks like, only better! Soup, sandwiches, burgers, salads, breakfast all day (actually 2:30, when they close), except the quality of the ingredients and care taken with prep is a notch better than you'd expect.   All the food is really good, with fast friendly service to boot. I'd like to try other places on this block, but it's hard not to go here every time lunch rolls around!"}
{"text":"The waffles had to be frozen. As they were inedible. Dry and crunchy.  Syrup served cold.  No refills on coffee.  My husband got the eggs Florentine. Not real eggs.  It seemed that all of the food was frozen and then warmed for your dining pleasure.   Trust me, it's not the best breakfast in town They advertise that they have the best breakfast in Pittsburgh. Not true. Not even close. Don't waste your money"}
{"text":"I take a few trips a year to Pittsburgh and one of the things I love is the down home feel of this city.  The Allegheny Sandwich shoppe is everything wonderful about pittsburgh in one spot.  Once walking in the customers and staff were so very nice.  It was like being transported back to a small town diner long before cell phones,  people were talking and not a single electronic device could be seen.  Amazing!  I ordered three eggs over medium, home fries, and toast.  While waiting I really enjoyed soaking in the atmosphere, listening to the conversations and humming along to the faint music playing.  Once the food came I went right at it.  The eggs were close to perfect looking with a hint of real butter,  the home fries were crispy with a more distinct butter taste.  The toast was great for dipping and of course lots of butter.  It had that feel like my southern grandma had made it. Staff 5 out 5 Atmosphere 5 out 5 Food 4 out 5 (just a bit too much butter) I would call it a 4.75..... but let's round this one up! I would recommend to friends and I'll be back"}
{"text":"Great steak and eggs.. The potatoes and my MR steak where perfect..just a lil to expensive my side of ham was a thin slice of ham from aloaf was def not worth its price.but all and all very good."}
{"text":"This little Gem has excellent service and even better food. Italian Meatball soup is amazing. Splurge and get a whole bowl not just a cup. Three Rivers Reuben was delicious."}
{"text":"Dining in a total different experience..  good food..  My bacon cheeseburger was really outta sight.  A group of us went at lunch time and we accomdated in a friendly manner..  by putting tables together.  The restaurant isn't too big but still packs in a crowd.   Theres a counter which I loved.. in case you are solo and want to grab a bite to eat !"}
{"text":"I had a very enjoyable breakfast here some time back. The buttermilk pancakes were very fluffy and weren't an effort to cut into as I've experienced in other places, so I didn't have to use a lot of maple syrup on them, which is a positive (who wants their food drowned in sauce/syrup?)... Staff was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"This is one of those places you never think to go to because they're always closed when you're not working (or awake). I wish they had longer hours! I finally visited on a day off from work and again, I wish they had longer hours!  By the looks on the outside and the name including the words \"sandwich shop,\" you wouldn't know it but this place is more like a diner serving up breakfast and lunch. For a Friday afternoon, this place was packed for lunch.   Hubby got the Reuben and I got the Hot Roast Beef.  What made these sandwiches delicious was definitely the buttery bread. The portions here are humongous! Good thing I was off that day or I never would have been able to make it back to work with a lunch this large. The prices are also super affordable.   Overall, I really liked this place. It's just hard finding the time to catch their hours of operation."}
{"text":"This place is great for breakfast.  The staff was very nice and personable.  It seems that they have a lot of repeat customers as the staff knew everyone's name.  I ordered their breakfast special which was chicken and waffles with sausage gravy.  It was absolutely fantastic!    The owner walked around and talked to the customers."}
{"text":"The perfect neighborhood diner breakfast spot. Everybody knows your name when you walk in. Donna & Joy introduce themselves and make you feel like family. The meals are your typical and wonderful diner options. The pancakes are huge and flavorful. The scramblers are hearty and delicious. This should be a weekly breakfast stop for all Allegheny West residents!"}
{"text":"excellent brunch place on the north side. strong recommended, food variety. very friendly staff and got to meet the owner. A hidden gem worth trying!"}
{"text":"I love discovering new places in our beautiful city!  My visit to the Allegheny Sandwich Shoppe was the result of me having to wait on someone that had an appointment nearby.  I wanted breakfast really really bad.  Like, I really really wanted it.  You know that feeling when you just want what you want, right? Of course, I come here to see what my trusted Yelp buddys have to say about the good eats in the area.  I take a look at the comments for this place and I'm sold.   Parking in this area is never good, nor easy to figure out.  I know the sign says free parking across the street but, yeah, I just didn't get it.  Anyway, I ended up parking in the alley that is right beside the restaurant...problem solved.  I walked in and was immediately greeted by a smiling lady behind the counter.  The place is clean and cozy.  It's small but not uncomfortable...it's just right.  I asked where I should sit and she told me to sit wherever I liked.  She gave me a menu and I took a gander at all of the yummy offerings.  I decided to go with my first craving, which was breakfast.  They have breakfast bowls, combos, omelets, a la carte items, etc.  I was really surprised to see steak, eggs, potatoes and toast for under $9 and I was tempted but I ended up going for the swiss and mushroom omelet that came with home fries (made with red potatoes:), toast and coffee.  While the food was good, it wasn't very hot when it arrived which is my only reason for deducting a star.  I overheard another patron ask if her food could be warmed up in the microwave so it might just be a timing thing.  The coffee was DELICIOUS and the waitress was on her game, checking in with me periodically and keeping my cup filled.  While I was eating, the waitress and hostess were talking to all of us diners and it was very light hearted and fun.  They really made me feel welcomed here.  My meal was less than $6 and it was a nice sized portion and I ended up taking half of it home.    It goes without saying, I will be back.  Hopefully to try one of the burgers or specials on the menu or...maybe I'll grab a cup of Joe.  Yes, it was really that good!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, delicious food, decent prices. Open for breakfast and lunch. I think they close at 2pm. I had the special that day \"trucker's hash\" which was their home fries covered in pot roast, bacon pieces & gravy, topped with a sunny side up egg. Comes with toast. It was so good and hit the spot just right. It's a healthy portion- had leftovers. My gf got the buttermilk pancakes. They were FANTASTIC. Some of the best for sure!"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about this place!  They don't have gourmet sandwiches or breakfast, but they have such an old fashioned feel to the restaurant, and they serve the staples, and do it well.   We've gone for breakfast and it was amazing.  The best part?? They GRIND their own coffee there, so they have the best coffee of any breakfast place I've tried.  They have an amazing reuben sandwich (with REAL turkey in it, which isn't standard, but was an amazing addition to this classic!) and their omelettes are great.  But that COFFEE!  This is our favorite place for a saturday morning, lazy, affordable breakfast.  We just went back for lunch and their bread is really great - solid and sturdy!  The sandwiches have a good amount of meat in them, the BLT was really good (we added an egg) and the bacon was crisp and copious.  Their brewed iced tea is to die for - so refreshing!   To make it even better, their staff is excellent.  We're always seated really quickly, and we've been waited on twice by Joy who is utterly delightful.  If you're having a bad day, you might as well go down there, get a cup of coffee and talk to Joy - she is such a ray of sunshine, so helpful and really courteous.  All in all, we ADORE this place.  It is nothing fancy, but it is solid, secure, quaint and everything you could want for a great lunch under $20."}
{"text":"First time here and everyone was so friendly! Took my little man and they were so kind to him and treated him with respect. We got the lunch express with turkey sandwich and salad. Everything was fresh and healthy. The cottage cheese was great too. Totally recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Great little shop, awesome food, large portions at a good price. Everyone is very friendly. Not one of those normal downtown shops where everyone is shoulder to shoulder moving like cattle.       I had the blue cheese burger and chili cheese fries. Good luck with that. The chili cheese fries were probably 2lbs and the burger was at least a 1/2lb patty on a large buttery toasty bun sided with chips and pickle. I did what little damage I could do to this meal and grabbed a to go bag. The blue cheese burger was great. The broil it with the cheese on to brown it a bit. The chili cheese fries were real chili topped with a few slices of American cheese. I was a little off put about their cheese choice but it turned out pretty good.      All in all this place is legit and I will be returning soon"}
{"text":"This a super sweet, local small business nestled in the middle of the North Side. The owners and staff are very welcoming - you feel like a regular while eating here!   My coworkers and I come to the sandwich shoppe every other week for lunch. The service is always quick and the food is usually delicious.   This particular visit was on a Friday afternoon. The restaurant was PACKED, so bear that in mind if you plan on going on a week day.   Their Friday soup special is a clam chowder and I can honestly say it was the best I've ever had. The cup was overflowing when my waitress brought it to the table - their portions are always huge here. I ordered their Three Rivers Rueben as my main dis and I was not that impressed. I fancy myself a Rueben connoisseur and this one just seemed greasy and not flavorful. The ratio of corn beef and turkey breast was off, as well - too much turkey and not enough corn beef. Definitely not their best sandwich. I'd go for the Triple Decker Club or Fish Sandwich (those never disappoint).   Overall, I love the charm of the sandwich shoppe and recommend it for a quick, filling lunch."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC breakfast people so nuce and the b9nus Memorial weekend cookies a great toych Throughly enjoyed entire experience  Priced very nice"}
{"text":"If you want Thai food, the Northside has it. If you want Italian, the Northside has it. If you want Middle Eastern, Irish, Mexican, you guessed it, the Northside has it. Sometimes though, I just want some good ol' fashion American comfort food and that's when I turn to the Allegheny Sandwich Shoppe.  A breakfast and lunch spot located on Western Ave, the Allegheny Sandwich Shop makes delicious, straight forward breakfast classics, home made soups, a damn fine chili, and awesome sandwiches. I'll even go as far to say that they make the best rueben in the city.   One thing that I love about this place is that for the most part you can order anything on the menu at any time during the day. I've been know to wake up on a Saturday morning feeling less stellar. Knowing that I can come here and get a coffee, water, and a hot roast beef sandwich with fries and gravy at 9:30 in the morning makes the occasional hangover a hell of a lot easier to deal with.   Do yourself a favor some beautiful weekend and come to the Northside, go for a walk through the park, and come to Allegheny Sandwich Shop to satisfy whatever craving you may have."}
{"text":"Friendly atmosphere and very good service. But the Reuben sandwich didn't have very much meat, a disappointment since the other ingredients were plentiful."}
{"text":"This is the best hidden gem in the North Side. Allegheny Sandwich Shoppe is a great place for the young and old alike. I stopped in lunch today and couldn't have been more pleased - I got there around 12:30 pm and got seated right away. Although, it was a busy time of the day - our waitress was so friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.   The clam chowder was delicious- it's a Friday staple. I opted for the fish sandwich was my entree - the fish sandwich came with fries and coleslaw. As you can see in the photos I've snapped - the fish sandwich is huge and the fries are a very reasonable portion. It was amazing.  The restaurant is open from 6:30am - 2pm Mondays - Fridays. It's open on Saturdays from 7am - 1pm and closed on Sundays.   I'll be back soon and hopefully soon for breakfast."}
{"text":"I came in for a lunch I wanted to sit and relax  this is a great little spot they have a bar/counter and TV menu has Sammies, salads and burgers I opted for the special of the day which was a salmon salad  it was very cute waitress said what the special was ..then she said let me show you  and she came back with the \"model\" it looked delish so I opted for it  cold beverages are served in foam cups at first I was like ugh its wasteful but then I got my fresh brewed iced tea and I swear it was so cold I loved it  big difference...frosty cold so good my salad was really nice greens with a generous salmon piece and a tasty citrus dressing  friendly service  its a great little place for lunch there is metered parking on the street and a little lot that is theirs"}
{"text":"Delicious.    Stopped in today for lunch. I work on the north side now (goodbye Cranberry!!!!!!). My job is affiliated with a school so most of the time I head to the teachers lounge for free lunch. I had a late meeting today and had to head out for lunch. A trusty yelp search lead me here!  The inside is cute! It has a few tables & a counter. Looks very similar to a diner. The menu is a mix of sandwiches, burgers and salads... Except a really good menu of not so plain jane sandwiches. Most sandwiches cone with a bag of chips and range to be about $9-10. At first i was upset that sandwiches didn't come with fries, but while waiting on my to-go order, I saw some sandwiches come out. Wow they were huge!!  I ordered the north side grill. It was served on Texas toast and had a huge amount of deli turkey. (Or ham?! Crap. I'm a horrible reviewer) it also had sauteed mushrooms + 3 different cheese (wow!)  Sandwich was good (& huge) but next time I will try something different. Very cheesy yet dry. Needed mayo or something. Idk  Overall delicious . its only open til 230 by the way. They take cards"}
{"text":"I know this phrase is overused on Yelp, but this place is a hidden gem!  If you're looking for a cute little place on the North Side to grab some casual, delicious diner-style breakfast or lunch eats, look no further!  CM and I stopped by yesterday at 12:30pm for lunch on the way to the Mattress Factory, since we didn't have cash, ruling out my first choice (Wilson's BBQ).  Despite being my second choice, this sweet little sandwich shoppe (love the old-timey spelling, BTW!) exceeded our expectations.  Based on the recommendation of our waitress, I ordered the blueberry pancake special ($5.09), and a side order of home fries ($1.50).  My order came with three good-sized pancakes packed with delicious, juicy whole blueberries, topped with a ribbon of whipped cream.  The last time I received pancakes with this many blueberries was at Dutch Eating Place in RTM in Philly!  The pancakes themselves were of a nice consistency--not too thick or thin, or too light or heavy--just right.  My only wish was that there was more whipped cream--but then again, my waistline is thanking me for not flagging down the waitress to ask for more.  The home fries were cooked just right, with a hint of crispness on the outside, and were further enhanced by some additional salt/pepper seasoning and hot sauce.  CM ordered the chicken breast sandwich, Cajun style ($6.95), which was topped with lettuce and tomatoes, and came with a side of chips and a mayonnaise-y dipping sauce.  Because he was still feeling under the weather, I didn't sample it, but he was very pleased with it--although he did tell me it wasn't very spicy. (But then again, this is Bland-burgh...)  Despite our arrival half an hour before closing, our waitress was convivial, assuring us that we could take our time eating and not rushing us out the door.  Based on their interactions with the employees, many of the other customers appeared to be regulars, which speaks well of this place's loyalty among the locals.  I only wish they were open past 1pm on Saturdays, since it would be nice to be able to feast on breakfast food and sandwiches later into the afternoon.  Our check came to $13.54--extremely reasonable, in light of the quality of the food received. Personally, I think this place is much better than Peppi's. 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"Allegheny Sandwich Shoppe is my goto lunch spot when I have a weekday off work. The service and food are great. I normally get the hot roast beef sandwich but honestly everything I've tried there is worth having again. The only downside to this place is they're not open on Steeler Sunday."}
{"text":"Ham and cheese omelet had tons of ham and little cheese. I like cheese! Service sass awesome."}
{"text":"A really good place for breakfast and lunch, but really limited hours.  Park in the big lot across the street instead of fighting with street parking"}
{"text":"This place is adorable! It's the small and cozy kind of place you expect to see in a Hallmark Christmas movie. And it's the kind of place that you can easily find yourself becoming a 'regular'. The staff were really nice,service was fast and the food was delicious and cheap. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"What a great find!!  We had breakfast there this morning and it was delicious!  Joy, our server, was AMAZING, her name is perfect for her!! The owner, Nick, made it a point to introduce himself to everyone. It is a true Pittsburgh treasure!"}
{"text":"Saturday morning breakfast-busy, food looked good, there was an open table, so why not! And we decided to eat here. Had the potential to be good...if my order would have came out right the first time...or the 2nd time...3rd time is the charm? Not so much... I ordered 3 eggs poached hard, dry rye toast double toasted and a fruit cup. We waited about 40 min for our food. But we didn't mind, our coffee was filled. When my order came the eggs were runny, toast was cold and fruit had granola on top. I could have dealt with the fruit and toast but runny eggs are a no no. I sent them back and the waitress insisted on new fruit too. My husband and I waited another 20 min or so and they finally came back with my order, toast buttered.  I sent that back and it came back barely toasted.  The order was wrong twice and we barely even got an apology. No kudos on customer service.  That in itself doesn't get our business again."}
{"text":"Never have I ever encountered more rude people ... Opening day of Pittsburgh pirates and go into get drinks and to use the restroom and I am told that I have to buy more then a drink to use the facilities....simply told the ignorant people I will go down the block to spend my money. Rudest Pittsburghers EVER"}
{"text":"I thought this would be a hipster lunch spot but it turned out to be more of a breakfast/lunch diner. Hubby had half a good corned beef sandwich and a cup of hot, spicy chili. I had the tomato blossom with tuna salad, although it's still early in the season for tomatoes. A little salt helped. The waitresses were very friendly, and the kitchen was fast. Cheap, too."}
{"text":"Great food, quick service, good portions, free coffee refills.  I had a ham and cheese omelet with home fries, and it was by far one of the best breakfasts I have ever had.  The only sad part is that I don't live closer to this delicious, well-priced food because I would eat it every-single-day."}
{"text":"One of the best diners around--great traditional breakfast and lunch dishes, and a homey, comfortable atmosphere (and neat as a pin and super clean and tidy--especially for a diner!). The service here is efficient, friendly, and warm. I've never had a bad meal here, or anything less than stellar service. A HUGE, irreplaceable asset to the historic North Side. Highly, highly recommended. A++++"}
{"text":"Best breakfast sausage of my life! Seriously. This place wins - the flavor was on point. They were sizzling hot and still tender on the inside. If that's all you need to get you to visit this place, then I've done my job.   We came for breakfast after finding it on Yelp as we hunted for a good diner-style spot. The place was packed - likely because there was a Pitt football game and everyone who wasn't tailgating was eating here. Right as we walked in, a table opened up. We just missed the wait. Phew! The server was visibly exhausted and it was barely 10am so we ordered coffees quickly as we scoured the menu. It looked like the place was full of locals and the server did not want to entertain my hemming and hawing over what to order - everything looked good, how do I decide? Skillets, breakfast BLT!? Do they have specials? I still don't know. The pressure was on so I went for the classic option to determine a diner's skill set - 2 eggs over easy, toast and sausage. I immediately felt regret like I didn't order right, but when my breakfast was placed before me, my concerns floated away. It was simple, yet perfect. The eggs were just right with runny yolks for dipping the most crispy sour dough toast, and the sausage. Eye heart emojis forever. I also stole a few bites of homefries from my boyfriend's plate because they looked crispy (I hate a soft homefry) and they were perfectly cooked and seasoned. He devoured his western omelet and we departed soon after for a day of city exploring. This was a hearty meal that kept us full past lunch time.  For a no nonsense, well prepared diner breakfast, this place is it!"}
{"text":"One of the best breakfasts on the Northside. I love the hometown diner feel and the friendly faces inside. Inexpensive, home-cooked style food makes this place stand out from your cookie-cutter chain breakfast buffet. Plenty of parking across the street is also a plus. Oh and be sure to get the spicy sausage... Whether it's for breakfast or on your sandwich at lunch!"}
{"text":"My wife brought back sandwiches from Allegheny sandwich shoppe the other day for lunch. I had a reuben sandwich on rye. I have never been there so can not comment on store or service. The sandwich was good and I probably would go there if I was near bye. It was not the best reuben I have had in Pittsburgh but it was good. I will write an update if I go there myself."}
{"text":"The perfect place for a casual, delicious, and filling meal. We were craving sandwiches and stopped here for a quick sit-down lunch.   I ordered the Three Rivers Reuben which comes with chips and a pickle. This is $9.95 and very filling! A solid Reuben with carved turkey AND corned beef, accompanied by your typical Reuben toppings and marbled rye.   My date had the hot roast beef sandwich, listed as one of the shops specialties. It was $8.95, paired with fries, and the whole thing was SMOTHERED in gravy. Although there may have been a bit too much gravy, this hearty dish was filling and warming on a cold winter day.   The service was great, prices reasonable, and everyone in the shop seemed to have a smile on their face.  Would recommend!"}
{"text":"Work nearby, and have never had a bad meal here. Great price, friendly staff! I'm so happy I found this little place. One of the Northside's hidden gems. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"The most disappointing part about Allegheny Sandwich Shoppe is that it had so much potential. We went early Saturday before a Pitt game and ordered breakfast. They weren't very busy, but the food still took 40 minutes. Then my wife's eggs, which she asked for extra well so there was no runny yolk, came out barely cooked at all. We had to send them back, and after another 15 minutes they came back out, almost just as bad. In addition, she had asked for toast dry and extra toasted. The first time it came as bread, not even toasted. The second time it came buttered. The third time, it came barely toasted again, but at this point we just wanted to leave. My omelet could have been good... but I ate it cold as I waited for my wife's food. It didn't make matters any better than the waitress rolled her eyes at us when we sent the food back. I highly doubt we will be back."}
{"text":"This place has been around forever. I was once addicted to the cracked peppercorn burger. It was to die for. Lots of other sandwich/burger places have popped up and I'm glad to see that these guys are keeping it going; most especially with competition so close to them."}
{"text":"They claim to have the \"best\" burger on the North Side. They're in stiff competition with Benjamin's down the street then! I love Benjamin's, although I do think they make some fancy iterations on a burger. Here it's your standard burgers.   So while my burger was good, it wasn't the best one I've ever had. It came with a side of chips... I think I should have switched to fries, they just seemed to look better than the chips, and I believe they were probably store bought chips, not homemade.   I'd totally be down to stop in again and try out a sandwich and mix it up. The prices are super reasonable and the service was friendly. You can't beat that combo!"}
