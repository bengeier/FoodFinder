{"text":"Some of the best sandwiches we've had around Pittsburgh with my favorite being the d. Crocket. Yum!!!! Thanks Luke!"}
{"text":"Stopped in today for a sandwich and a coffee.  Of course I left more then satisfied. First off Zeke's coffee which I have never had before is made fresh and is really outstanding. I went with a breakfast sandwich called the \"Mile High\" came with peppers and onions and of course made fresh and steamie! All the ingredients are fresh and the Pretzel bun from SouthSide Pretzel shop is outstanding. Really thinking outside of the box at this place. I received the sandwich and a large coffee for around $6.50--great price for the quality. Owner and chef definitely are following plan A and doing it right. I will be back. A quality sandwich shop is hard to find. Next time I'm going to have to try the meatballs or their soup which I heard is great. Clean and welcoming environment!"}
{"text":"All food is fresh, homemade and delicious.....and the atmosphere feels like you are having breakfast or lunch with your best friends.  The staff, particularly Roseanne, are always welcoming and friendly.....this is an exceptional place to grab something to eat or hangout with a cup of coffee.  A wonderful addition to Dormont and the South Hills."}
{"text":"My favorite spot to eat in Dormont. The sandwiches, dogs and sides are great. Staff has always been welcoming and gone out of their way to give me great service. Once one of the gentleman drove me home because they didn't have drink carriers and I was walking with 3 large coffees. On another occasion I ordered delivery and they had run out of orange juice so the driver stopped and picked some up for me. There is something on the menu for everyone. My favorite aspect of the menu is the \"lottery ticket\" - whoever is cooking picks your bread, meat, cheese, toppings and dressing. I'm not a picky eater, but I am very indecisive so having this option takes all the thought out of it for me. They also serve great coffee."}
{"text":"This place is great! The owner is very personable and attentive to customers. Great sandwiches made with local breads and meats... My daughter said the sausage patty she got was the best she had ever had. Great coffee, too. Spread the word! Help this local business thrive!"}
{"text":"I enjoy new local places.  This is a great one.  Had a sandwich that I'd never had before.  If I was closer, this place might become a regular favorite.  As it was I had an enjoyable drink and sandwich while sitting at an outside table."}
{"text":"Friendly fun, family run atmosphere. The homemade meatball (add pepperoni), on a pretzel bun, is as easy to eat as it is delicious. Unbelievably affordable breakfast/lunch combos (vs chain competitors); with noticeably higher quality ingredients and preparation. Lastly, the only steamed sandwich shop (I'm aware of) in the burgh -- well worth the stop!"}
{"text":"Yummy fresh local food with unique combinations. Staff and owners as sweet and hospitable as can be. We stopped here on a road trip and we're happy to find such a great spot!"}
{"text":"First, let me start out by saying that I love having a neighborhood sandwich shop again!! Everything is fresh, made to order and delicious. I opted for one of their creations - \"the dillio\", which consists of turkey, bacon, avocado, (I subbed pepper jack for Swiss), lettuce and tomato on a whole wheat bagel. Every bite was enjoyable! Employees are super friendly also!"}
{"text":"I could eat here every day. Having these guys across the street has made all this construction bearable, if not worth it. The staff is fantastic and personable; no wonder they've built such a loyal following.   These sandwiches will change your world. Really, I cannot say enough good things about this place. And if you ever need anything catered, they've got you covered there as well.  Parker's, you bring down the house. You can expect to see me often and for years to come."}
{"text":"Stopped in this morning to grab three breakfast sandwiches to go.  Delicious!  Quality ingredients and amazing value.  You m u s t check this place out."}
{"text":"Favorite place to get a breakfast sandwich in Pittsburgh. Super friendly staff, awesome coffee, awesome food. Go to Parkers!"}
{"text":"We found ParkersPGH on Yelp as we were passing thru Dormont.  The food was fresh and delicious. Contrary to Kristin M's nasty rant against \"Aunt Roe\", Rose proved to be quite delightful and we felt like family before we left. Next time we find ourselves nearby, we will be back."}
{"text":"Just wish I lived close enough that I could visit more often!  Great sandwich shop. Had a turkey sandwich on a whole wheat bagel with lettuce cheese tomatoes and banana peppers. I enjoyed every bite. Really fresh ingredients. I'm looking forward to trying more sometime soon. Very clean and great service also."}
{"text":"Parker's is a Pittsburgh Gem!  They have great breakfast sandwiches and amazing lunch specials.  Their coffee is produced locally and always delicious!"}
{"text":"Love Parkers breakfast and lunch sandwiches. My personal favorites are wakie wakie and nana republic. Good food and great people-- can't go wrong. Also they have Cherokee red sooooooo... just to already."}
{"text":"We went to Parker's for breakfast, and ordered bagel sandwiches. We've been looking for a decent breakfast bagel shop for years, and we finally found it. The ingredients were fresh, the coffee was great, and the staff was so friendly. Parker's is a comfortable, hip, diner-style spot right on the Blvd. This has absolutely hit the top of my charts, and I'll be returning to try some other items on the menu.   2 things I'd recommend: 1) offer the bagel toasted. Although the sandwich was delicious, I prefer my everything bagel sammies to have a slight crunch. Toasting would do the trick.  2) wrap the bagels in a paper, then cut in half. Having the sandwich somehow wrapped would assist in keeping it together and not fall apart as easily, since the sandwiches are pretty darn fresh.  Since these are my personal preferences, still going with 5 stars. Don't think twice, go to Parker's"}
{"text":"Wanted something different for breakfast than my typical benny or pancake special at Dor-Stop or Pamela's.  I ordered the Fat Boy's Breakfast... WOW!  what a breakfast sandwich!  It was the size of my head and full of deliciousness!  So excited about these great spots in the South Hills!  Will be back again to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"Omg this place is awesome. We are from Colorado and this place was perfect. The owner and staff were absolutely wonderful and the food was delicious!  Our family gives Parkers two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Sandwiches were excellent and the owners were super nice. Definitely will be coming back and trying out their breakfast."}
{"text":"Unique sandwiches and homemade lemonade is Parker's M.O.  Each sandwich is better than the last.  Dont be a dumb idiot and not go!"}
{"text":"I love the stage of the little family restaurant. I enjoyed watching the family working together in the kitchen while chatting with the frequent customers lived nearby. They have many traditional and unique bagel recipes."}
{"text":"Love this place to grab a sandwich and a side.  Friendly people.  Good food at a good price.   Always enjoy a chance to shop local!"}
{"text":"Awesome local spot amazing breakfast sandwiches perfect for a hangover- not much on the outside but don't miss out"}
{"text":"I just went to Parker's for the first time in maybe two months, then I went back again a day later for dinner.  Everything I've had from there has always been awesome but I had some new things that were really good.  The buffalo mac n' cheese is really good, not too hot but a little spicy and creamy.  The D. Crockett is made with a brined and then baked chicken breast which they slice when they made it and then throw on the griddle, probably my go to sandwich.  The grilled cheese with bacon named after the Dude, Donny and Walter in the Big Lebowksi was awesome and not just because of the name.  The Mahoney is really good too, as is their Dormont Dogs style hot dogs.  Definitely a great place with a great staff and really good Zeke's coffee."}
{"text":"This is an awesome little local spot in Dormont! The food is so good, and everyone working there was super welcoming! The menu is primarily sandwiches, but the selection would be sure to please. They also have mac and cheese that you can add different toppings to - I chose the bacon mac and cheese and I was not disappointed. The papagiorgio sandwich was sooooo good. The location itself is small, so it might not be the best for a large group of people, but it's definitely somewhere to check out. They also have a catering menu, and from the homemade eats I sampled I'm sure it's worth a look."}
{"text":"A key point of Parker's it that they are family friendly and has an informal atmosphere..  They even have a high chair for the smaller customers  Jack Tallon."}
{"text":"This used to be Dormont Dogs and we also loved getting hot dogs there. Just the different ideas they came up with that always tasted so good. The hot dog menu is very limited and there are several other items on the menu now. Everything was good.   I enjoyed the Hello Tommy which is tomato and fresh mozerella on a bagel, it was very good and full of flavor. My wife ordered a hot dog and was not impressed, she was hoping for Dormont Dogs and it just doesn't compare. I think it is the variety that was offered before that made the place a staple.   Parkers is a good dinner with fresh tasteful food though, if you are in the area and hungry."}
{"text":"So happy Parker's has moved to Brookline! The decor is adorable and pays homage to Pittsburgh and this family's roots. The owner is usually manning the register when I come in and she's super nice. She said she's trying to remember people's names which made me love this place more.   We have been here a few times. Mostly we just sit at the bar as the two of us but we brought my group of in-laws one Saturday for lunch. They're from out-of-town and really enjoyed the ambience and food. It's a great place to bring a group because everyone can find something they like from breakfast sandwiches to Mac and cheese. My favorite is the classic everything bagel and cream cheese.   You have to get the lemonade! They make every order fresh! It's soooo good!"}
{"text":"Love parkers, food is amazing, Matt, Luke, & Rose great people, always put customers first. Rose always has my coffee on the counter & a big hello the minute i walk in the door, she is the HEART of parker's  YAAAYYYYYY, Parkers PGH is open at their new location on brookline blvd!!!!!!! Few new faces, same DELICIOUS food, stop in & say hi to Rose, Luke, & the new folks, you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"By far the best egg sandwich ever. I'll be back to try their hotdogs!"}
{"text":"I got the d. Crocket and kept it on the hoagie (usually I switch out for the pretzel bun).  It doubled the size and was so good and delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is a nice little addition to Dormont.  The product that these guys use is top notch.  A lot of the meat comes from a sister company that is local to the area.  High quality bread, and great coffee.  I know one of the hardest things for a new business is to continue using a high quality product, and I'm confident that these guys understand the importance of this.    Keep it fresh, keep it local, and your customers will continue to come back.    My only complaint is the size of the place, but its a brand new business and a small start is a good start."}
{"text":"Great homemade sandwiches. Very authentic!! The family that runs the place was very nice and attentive. Many flavors of different Macs N Cheeses. Pretty good just a little dry"}
{"text":"This restuarant opened right after I moved to Brookline and we come at least once a month. The staff are beyond accommodating, the food is amazing, and I love the hometown Pittsburgh feel of the restuarant. If you are looking for a new breakfast spot, give Parkers a try."}
{"text":"This is a cute little breakfast/brunch/lunch option in Dormont. Great coffee and cheap and yummy sandwiches/bagels. Besides the fact that they've lots of veggie options, what makes me like them even more is that they serve the breakfast options way past lunch time. You'll get a solid value for money in that, their sandwiches are BIG! I remember when my friend's order came out, we thought at first that the two halves were both our sandwiches! And then mine came out and I was like WOW.. these are good sized portions. I'd recommend Parkers more for a takeaway lunch because although really welcoming, their seating options are limited. Funnily enough, the restaurant flooring is a bit wonky in that, you'll find yourself sliding off the bar stools. I found it so strange that I kept sliding off and kept assuming that the previous night's alcohol had still not worn off but finally reached a point where I had to ask the staff if it was me or whether the floor was actually tilted. And I was RIGHT!! It was and they've never been able to fix it!! They informed me that they're moving soon though.. so look out for an updated location. Lol! But, if you intend to dine in, try to sit at the one table as soon as you enter to the left. It's the only table where you won't slide off or things wont roll off."}
{"text":"Parkers Pgh is so so. I ate here one time for lunch, the sandwich I got wasn't bad but wasn't anything special. I ordered the Junebug vegetarian sandwich. I do like how they have quite a few different vegetarian sandwich options. And some of the sandwich combinations are different than what you'll find at other restaurants. I'll definitely go back to Parkers Pgh and give them another try. I would like to try their breakfast egg sandwiches. On a side note their prices are really good. Majority of sandwiches are $5-7."}
{"text":"Great local place. We are from out of town and wanted a local place to eat. Great menu with decent breakfast and lunch options. Small diner type with nice out door seating.   Very nice people work here. We went here with our 2 little kids and one of the guys (asked first too!) offered the kids Twizzlers.   Would definitely come back!!!"}
{"text":"This place was great. The family that runs it is completely awesome. Its a very quiet place but the menu is fun. Many different option for sandwiches... Always homemade soups and sides. They bring the best ingredients from all over Pittsburgh and put them together for you. Pretzels from the Pretzel Shop, Coffee from Zekes', I think their bread may be from Breadworks... They are so friendly and the food is great for a lunch. I hear they also have awesome breakfast sandwiches. I may have to try that out soon."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place.  If you're remotely close to the Dormont area and want a sandwich, stop by.  The staff is always great, and being such a small shop you get to see it all getting made right in front of you.  The coffee from Zeke's is sure to get you going, and also check out their fresh sides they're always making, from a mac n cheese to a chili or a pasta salad."}
{"text":"Nice little lunch spot.   Really fresh ingredients.   I had the Mahoney and really enjoyed it.   It is prepared fresh in front of you.  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Don't let the size fool you. Came on a Saturday afternoon. The place has 2 small tables and a counter. If you are looking for a sandwich to go or a nice casual place to eat.  This is the place. I ordered a ham and cheese on a bagel it was my first time having a steamed sandwich. It was really good.  I would come back again."}
{"text":"Got a sausage, egg, and cheese breakfast sandwich on a pretzel bun. The thinnest patty of sausage you have ever seen and it was not very warm. Bun was dense and hard. Coffee was good, though."}
{"text":"Stopped into Parker's today after seeing some of the reviews on Yelp. The food was amazing & we'll definitely be going back!! Talked with Parker himself & they're actually moving up to Brookline by May to a bigger location. Their menu options all looked so good it was hard to pick. I ended up getting the Benson U breakfast sandwich and my boyfriend got the Cameron Poe grilled cheese + a cup of tomato soup. The grilled cheese was actually on a slit open hot dog bun - so good!!"}
{"text":"This spot was such a jewel with fresh sandwich choices and a great tomato basil soup. You won't leave there hungry. The Meatballs are a family recipe and simply a juicy yummy scrumptious sandwich! Try it.  I had one of the grilled cheese and loved it.  Great family atmosphere.  Stop in for a taste of Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"I love Parker's! They have wonderful breakfast sandwiches and the staff behind the counter is always friendly and talkative. It has a real neighborhood feel, and its always nice to pop in and chat.  There is always a specials board and the ones I've had so far have been damn good. I knew I was sold when I read the description for the \"Hugo Stiglitz\"-eggs, salami, cheese, bacon, pickles, and garlic aoili on a pretzel bun. Delicious! Anywhere that puts salami on a breakfast sandwich over the expected ham wins in my eyes.  My only complaint is their hours-not opening until 10am on some weekdays, which seems pretty late for a breakfast and lunch place."}
{"text":"The value of this place is immeasurable.  The quality of food combined with the inexpensive prices will have you as a repeat customer for life!  From chicken noodle soup to meatball hoagies...the menu is top notch, from top to bottom. Relationships are important at parkers, whether it's a menu item tribute to the ol dormont dogs shoppe or using fresh pretzel buns from the local Southside haunt.  Make sure when you stop in, tell Luke you were sent by \"the king\"."}
{"text":"Diners are one of my happy places, and this little spot makes me very happy. Warm greeting, hot coffee, delicious breakfast. This isn't my hometown, it's my maternal grandparents' home place. I can feel their spirits here."}
{"text":"I love the innovation they have with their sandwiches. I had a vegi sandwich on a bagel. Which was pretty good. And my kids and hub like the hot dogs. The 4 stars are because it's not a place you can really sit and relax while you eat kind of place. More of a grab and go."}
{"text":"Great meatball sandwich. Great decor and great staff. Nothing but five stars when from he time you arrive to the time you leave."}
{"text":"We were looking for somewhere to have breakfast and both Tom's Diner and Dor Stop were both filled to capacity. I found this place and decided to give it a try. We had breakfast there; I'll start by saying the staff was extremely nice and easy to talk to and everything is made fresh daily. The inside and cooking area is very clean and organized.   We ordered breakfast bagels. They were made with perfection.   I have a feeling this place will be around for a long time. I'm looking forward to our 2nd (and future) visits.  I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"A last minute lunch brought us to Parker's.  It's small with bar stools to eat at the counter or bar stools to eat at the counter looking out the window. There were two 2 seat tables outside so we sat at one of those. Parker's has a varied menu that is mostly sandwiches-breakfast or lunch/dinner. They offer \"Dormont Dogs\" and a couple of salads. You definitely can't beat the prices.  We ordered the \"Barkley's Golf Swing\" (chicken, provolone, Alabama White Lightening Sauce, and pickles on a hoagie roll) and the Mona Lisa Vito (meatballs, green peppers, onions, provolone on a hoagie roll).   We also ordered the Pepperoni Mac n Cheese.  The Alabama sauce is a mayo based BBQ sauce. It sounds weird but tastes amazing!  It was a great match with the chicken. The meatballs on the Mona Lisa Vito were delicious. Sometimes a marinara sauce can be too sweet but this sauce had a perfect balance.  When my husband went to pay he let them know they had forgotten our Pepperoni Mac n Cheese. It was a good thing since we were full from our sandwiches. They apologized and not only took $2 off of our bill, but gave us a coupon for 2 free Bacon Mac & Cheeses. Talk about taking care of your customers!  It's been awhile since I've had that kind of care. It's one of the pluses of doing business with a small business. One of the best things about Parker's besides the customer care is that they use items like coffee and pretzels from local Pittsburgh businesses.  Stop in and give it a try. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Took 30 mins to get 3 sandwiches and a side of fries to go... also the toppings, that were read back to me, and I was charged for, were not on the sandwich.. prices are great and food was decent but the total lack of urgency and attention to detail is off putting."}
{"text":"Really great breakfast sandwiches that are served all day long. The wait can be a little bit, but everything is made fresh so it's worth it!!"}
{"text":"Found this little Sandwich Spot using Yelp. Everything was made with local fresh ingredients. Everything was prepared right before you portions were large and very tasty. You need to try the White Lightning sauce!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to get a Steamie Sandwich.  Parker's steams all the sandwiches, which I have had in other cities but never have seen in PGH.    Parker's is open for breakfast, coffee and lunch/sammies.  The sandwich menu is on a chalk board where you pick your bread (bagel, pretzel bun, sub roll) meat, cheese and condiments.  The sandwich is then steamed.  You get a nice warm steamed sandwich.  I had a meatball with pepperoni, provolone on a bagel with some banana peppers and onions.    Delicious!  Nice price too, $5. There were a couple of soups and a mac & cheese with bacon special.    Was told that all the bread, meat and coffee were bought from local PGH businesses.  Zeke Coffee, meat from Butcher on Butler and Strip District Meats.  The space is in the old Dormont Dog's location, with about 6 counter seats and three small tables."}
{"text":"A great steamed sandwich place in PGH - the steamed sandwiches are unlike any other sandwiches available in the city.  All the ingredients are local and super fresh - it's awesome to see PGH businesses support other local businesses and the community.  Breakfast sandwiches are insanely affordable and delicious, and I love the pretzel buns (also local).  The meatballs sandwiches are insanely good too (an old family recipe), and the meats are from Butcher on Butler (in Lawrenceville).  Also carries the best coffee in the Burgh, from Zeke's.  Definitely worth a trip, especially to try something new.  I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"I never went to Parker's when it was in Dormont but I tried them the other day and it's very good!  I got a sausage egg and cheese sandwich with home fries and it was very good. Not expensive at all either. I'll definitely go back to try some non breakfast foods but I'm excited to have a good breakfast/lunch joint on the boulevard.  Welcome Parker's!"}
{"text":"I love a good breakfast sandwich, and these people have some really awesome sandwiches."}
{"text":"I'm glad to see something take Dormont Dogs' spot that is worthy.  From my first, and only, impression I like the place, and the owner seems like a nice guy - it is great to see people my age (29) who are proprietors of their own businesses, and I really hope this guy makes it.  The decor of the place is really clean looking, and not overbearing...  I had a peanut butter and bacon sandwich on a pretzel bun.  Bacon and peanut butter is a great combo, and it really can't be screwed up, but it can be done better than others, and Parker's achieves that by having really freaking good pretzel buns, and of course the whole primes of the place, steaming the sandwich.  I am I happy there is a plain ole sandwich joint around, and a good one to boot - I plan on being a regular here.  You only wish the place was bigger with more of a kitchen so they could do more, and also it is too bad the place doesn't have a larger seating area.  Let your friends know; the place being on Glenmore makes it a bit hidden!"}
{"text":"Have eaten here twice and both times it was outstanding. Definitely a must try if looking for a great sandwich, hogie, or breakfast. Coffee is great and the fresh squeezed lemonade is awesome"}
{"text":"This is a review for breakfast.  The place is clean and the people are friendly. The coffee, which is Zeke's, was very good.  While they have simple eggs on the menu, the breakfast menu is predominantly sandwiches.  In addition to the speciality sandwiches you can make your own with a variety of toppings.  I debated only giving 3 stars since I thought my sandwich was just okay, but my buddy really liked his breakfast sandwich, he said it was excellent, and I can't give it 3 1/2 stars.    So why wasn't my sandwich great? It starts with the bagel. The bagel was soft, I suppose I could have asked for it toasted but that wasn't offered as an option, and it tasted like a bagel you would get at Giant Eagle, not a real bagel. The cheese on my sandwich was melted on to the bagel and not onto the egg - not a big deal but not the way I prefer it. I had avocado on my sandwich (at a $0.50 up charge) and the avocado slices were quite small to the point that I could barely taste it.  Net, net, the food was good but not fantastic. The price point at about $5 per sandwich is certainly reasonable. If I'm in Brookline and in need of breakfast, I would certainly go back. But I don't think I would make a special trip to Brookline for these breakfast sandwiches.  I'll have to give them another try for lunch, maybe that's where they will really shine."}
{"text":"Love the breakfast sandwiches here. Everything is made to order and the taste is great. I very much enjoy the pretzel buns they have as well. Always a good way to start the day."}
{"text":"Pretzel Bun. This makes an especially delicious sandwich. Especially when it's from The Pretzel Shop. And Parker's delivers on the fact that they provide said pretzel bun and also the ingredients to make a killer sammich!  I've had the mahoney (turkey, bacon, pepper jack, banana peppers, pickles, & white lightening) and switched to a pretzel bun and the annexation of puerto rico (turkey, swiss, sprouts, honey mustard on pretzel bun) for $5.50. Tell me that isn't a fantastic deal!?   If you were around in Dormont for years, you know that this is the former Dormont Dogs. They had fantastic hot dogs. I was devastated when they closed, but thankfully Parker's continues the dog love with a featured one from their old menu daily. Thank god!  There's a ton of different sandwiches to choose from but the sides are limited to around three daily. Usually a pasta salad or potato salad. The real star are the sammies though! There's a small bar to sit at or a few tables inside and when it's warm, outside. It's definitely worth a trek to Dormont to try this gem!"}
{"text":"Best hot dogs I've ever eaten."}
{"text":"While Brookline has many great lunch options, Parkers is my favorite!  Their breakfast and lunch sandwich options are simplistic, delicious, and cost efficient.  You should definitely check out this family owned and operated restaurant!"}
