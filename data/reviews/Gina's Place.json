{"text":"we tried this little diner Saturday morning, it is small but big on friendliness and breakfast was tasty. The owner came by and checked on us, she apoligized for the delay, they were training a new cook. Gina's is a Diner (the real deal) but dont look for roast beef / mash potatoes/gravy, or hash, this place is all about breakfast and friendly chit chat."}
{"text":"If you want great food with nothing but smiles, go to Gina's Place. She is the kindest, sincere, and most down to earth woman you'll ever meet."}
{"text":"Great greasy spoon with out the grease.

Moved a way some time ago but miss our Saturday breakfast routine."}
{"text":"Super tiny restaurant but the food is great. We both had breakfast and two drinks for under $12 which is a steal for most places. I would say that you couldn't fit more than 20 people in there and 15 of the 20 probably know each other somehow."}
{"text":"It is a diner, good for what it is, possible hangout for local old timers, but not a place to seek out. We had breakfast. Eggs, bacon, home potatoes with onion toast. Husband had pancakes. Prices were very reasonable, cash only. People seemed nice. Everything was good enough. If you're travelling and on a tight budget, this would be a decent stop. Nothing, though, was spectacular. No complaints."}
{"text":"Old fashioned diner. Delicious food that took a while to come out as its prepared to  order. Gina's super sweet."}
{"text":"Cute little breakfast and lunch spot where you'll find the same friendly faces serving the 7 tables and 8 barstools to the loyal and happy customers they have been gaining throughout the years. 
We've only ever came here for breakfast, but the portions are right, the food is great and coffee is hot. 
Don't be afraid to walk into this tiny little diner. They are as welcoming to the shy newcomers as they are to the regulars that fill up seats for hours."}
{"text":"Ever see a place that looks like a tiny little dive but it's constantly packed with cars and you figure it must have outstanding food?  Well, that's Gina's. Food is always delish. Gina is always there serving and knows everyone. Best Bacon and hash browns around! It's slow so if you're in a hurry, probably not the best idea to stop. But it's slow because there are so many orders ahead of yours because the food is great and super reasonably priced.

They only take cash, close at noon or 1, and are not open on Sundays."}
{"text":"Oh man, where do I start!?  I tell y'all this...Gina, (Owner of the Diner), is a Gem!!!  I just loved her pretty smile as she greeted me in the morning as I would come in to eat breakfast.  Her warmth, and customer service were Top Notch!!!  I think I'm in love with her.  ;)  LOL!!!  The food is prepared fresh, and they do serve big portions.  Oh, by the way...I was taken by surprise by this gesture or should I state, that I was given a choice of hot sauces.  Man, I'm from Dallas, Texas and we DO NOT have a choice at our restaurants...not like this right here.  Gina would give you a selection of at least 10 hot sauces...sort of like a wine list.  That there was cool to me!!!  Especially since I love hot sauce on everything that I eat.

I just wish I could bring this awesome lil Diner to Dallas, Texas.  I would be in Heaven every day eating the food at Gina's Diner.  

Note:  This place only takes cash

If you're into Diner style of food...you must come to this cool place.  They serve big portioned, and delicious food at a very cheap price.  Awesome Diner!!!  :)"}
{"text":"I was craving a good classic breakfast. I was driving by and this small restaurant's parking lot was packed. I was willing to give it a shot. When I walked in, I found this cute little hole in the wall restaurant. It is pretty small, but packed with smiling faces (of mostly retired men). 

Price:  The food is super cheap! I spent $6 and got coffee, 2 eggs, home fries, toast, 3 slices of bacon. There were even more specials like oatmeal, pancakes, steak and eggs. Everything on their menu is under $6. 
They do also serve some lunch specials (burgers, salads)

Food: The food was good! It was the classic breakfast I was craving. A little greasy. But so good. The home fries were wonderful. They were crunchy on the outside and fluffy potato on the inside. 

Service: It was great. My coffee never got more than half way empty. The one older waitress was so sweet! She made me feel so welcome. I felt like a regular even though this was my first time. There were so many people here who knew each other. They meet for breakfast every morning. The waitresses know their regular order. It just felt like a place I wanted to go to. Felt like home."}
{"text":"While not a regular, I have occasionally popped on and always leave satisfied.

Just great people making delicious food!  Small and cozy but always quick and good.  Portions are plentiful and service is just fantastic!

Get here soon!  A true diamond!"}
{"text":"My favorite place for breakfast! Only problem is they are closed on Sundays and close fairly early on Saturdays so you have to get there early to get a table. The place is very small but always has great service. FYI only takes cash. Prices are great and you get A LOT of food. The sausage patties are delicious and the potatoes are amazing especially when adding onion. Coffee is always hot a fresh and the servers are always around for refills so you never go empty."}
{"text":"First of all - I was really looking forward to eating at Gina's Place. I love small old school diner breakfast experiences.

Stopped in here for breakfast one morning - based on the positive Yelp reviews. It was a cold, snowy morning out. There is not a lot of space and seating inside - has that old school small diner vibe down pat.

I sat at the counter and looked over the menu. I attempted to order scrambled eggs with onions, bell pepper, mushrooms and cheese. I was informed by the lady behind the counter that I could not have cheese in my scrambled eggs - as it \"destroys their pans.\" I remarked that I make scrambled eggs at home ALL the time with cheese - and none of my pans have been \"destroyed.\" She responded: \"That's nice.\" I'm assuming what she meant is that - they are to lazy to clean the pans - so they don't offer cheese in scrambled eggs. But that is not what she stated.

The eggs were bland - no seasoning at all, nor to the vegetables that were added. I added black pepper, salt, and Sriracha sauce to the eggs to make them palatable. The sausage patties were fibrous and chewy - not a pleasant texture. I've never experienced sausage patties like that. The only thing I enjoyed on the plate was the breakfast potatoes.

I'd give Gina's Place a second chance next time I am in the area - hoping for a better breakfast experience next time.

{"text":"Nothing special or fancy, but it has simple food for a simple price. Gina is really nice."}
{"text":"Food is great. Parking lot is small, but there's plenty of parking around the area. Please note, cash only. There's an ATM across the street at the gas station, though. I got a huge omelet, two pancakes, and home fries for like seven dollars. Can't beat that."}
{"text":"After my wife reminded me about how bad a local breakfast place in West Park was on my last visit she suggested I try Gina's. I'm glad I listened. Gina's was excellent. The menu was simple, which is a good thing. They stay right within the parameters of traditional diner fare. The quality of the breakfast food was top notch. The home fries were from real boiled potatoes. They'll even make them with onions if you want. The sausage links were high quality. And the prices are cheap, especially if you order one of the breakfast specials that comes with coffee or juice. The waitresses are a little chatty, but in a good way. If your looking for a high quality, reasonably priced breakfast on the west side, give Gina's a try!"}
{"text":"This is the best place in Fairview for breakfast or lunch. Remember it's a diner not a big chain restaurant.  I'm sure you can find better food, or cheaper prices, but you will not find a better staff or atmosphere.  Don't get me wrong the food is wonderful.  You will not find a better diner in the state of ohio...period. 

The food quality is great, but it's not just about the food. This place is about the family atmosphere.  The owner/operator, Gina, is very friendly and makes you instantly feel like a regular.

This place is a landmark of Fairview.  It's the type of place you will want to eat breakfast at daily and stop back for lunch.   

Food prices are more than reasonable. Everything is great quality.

In today's world it's rare to find a small gem that keeps things simple. This place would fit in Mayberry perfectly."}
