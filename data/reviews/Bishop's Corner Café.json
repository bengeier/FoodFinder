{"text":"Bishops Cafe is a family owned business, run with care and quality. It is a great place to stop in for a quick lunch and is fast and easy for takeout. Their Reuben sandwich is huge and delicious! They really care about what you think and are always working to make great food even better. Beautiful wooden bar and tables! Is fast becoming a great local favorite."}
{"text":"This is one of the best bars in da Burgh.  Definitely the best in the West Hills.  Used to be the American Cafe, but it's been rebuilt inside and out (kitchen too!) and is 100% better.  Family run, family friendly, and always a great crowd.  And the food is really good AND reasonably priced.  Plus NO SMOKING!  Karaoke every Wednesday, and it looks like they're restarting the old American's \"Walking Dead\" nite on Sundays when the new season starts in February.  Complete with discounted zombie-themed drinks, of course!!"}
{"text":"Great weekend brunch! I had the huevos rancheros and my wife had the mushroom omelette."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed stopping in this place after stumbling upon it a couple weeks ago. The food here is awesome and fast, making it a perfect place for a quick bite. I ended up ordering the vegetarian omelet with mushrooms, spinach, and saut√©ed onions - delicious! It's a dive bar as well, homey environment, where a few locals appear to frequent. Closer towards evening time, the place will play classic hits such as piano man by billy Joel for a fun overall ambiance! Definitely will be checking this place out again."}
{"text":"Saw this place as we drove by on our way to our hotel. Took the packed parking lot as
A good sign so looked it up on yelp. It definitely lives up to the positive reviews!  It's a nice clean little pub. No smoking inside.  And the food was great!  Had the Ruben and it was truly spectacular.  Not a fancy place but if your looking for a good sandwich a beer and some sports on TV this is a great choice!"}
{"text":"Friendly little neighborhood bar and restaurant. Service is excellent. Prices are great. Food is good.  Had the fish platter. Sandwich, fries, and slaw. Going back to try the pizza!"}
{"text":"Great service.  Great food and a really cool spot to hang out for the WVU game.  Definitely going to be a regular stop."}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorite places to grab a quick bite, I feel this place is definitely overlooked by many but if you are in the area I would highly recommend checking them out."}
{"text":"Duuuuuuuude, what an awesome place!!! I had been here a few times when it was the American Cafe, and I really enjoyed it, but now it's on another level. It's been spruced up a bit and the food is top notch. We came here and they were short staffed and their cook called in sick, so their menu was limited. We had a BBQ chicken pizza and stuffed peppers, and both were Fantastic! The lady wasn't comfortable grilling chicken so she used chicken tenders instead and it was awesome! The stuffed peppers were served with buttered Italian bread and in a bowl with plenty of sauce for dipping. Charlie, the bartender, was great, and their prices are very reasonable! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Was going to meet a friend here. Stopped in. Looked nice but, unfortunately, another bar that reeks of grease in the air. Keep the grease in the kitchen! Going to Cadillac ranch but I'll check back here in a few months. Good luck."}
{"text":"An oasis in this suburb's chain-restaurant h-llscape. Imagine lingering over a generously poured cocktail or beer without screaming on order to communicate with your companions. Rather than being run by an algorithm out of some distant home office or an insecure 20-something who equates hip-bit-deafening background music with an appealing destination, Bishop's is a owned by a local family that actually cares about the experience of its guests. And you do feel like a guest here; even other patrons are friendly and welcoming. Great food, especially weekend breakfast. Some kind of ventilation etc. that would better confine cooking scents to the kitchen would be welcome, but either way this is terrific place."}
{"text":"Stopped in on Friday and had the fish special. The fish sandwich was great!  Definitely going to be a regular from now on. The tree benches are very cool."}
{"text":"Ham & Bean soup to die for!  Served with a side of thick, soft buttered bread. It was all that, trust me. 

We started with zucchini strips which was a generous serving and an equally generous side of very flavorful marinara. 

Hubs had the Pork Chop Special: one chop + side of potatoes and some very colorful, super flavorful Corn & Black Bean Salad.  I had to steal some of the latter and it was very  yummy.

I also had the Caesar Salad. Meh, it was ok.  Also served with the thick, soft buttered bread. 

The place is small, only a handful of tables. 

The parking lot is a challenge, small and packed. 

The service is great and the food is fabulous home - style cooking, served hot. 

If you're sick of the chain eatery experience and looking for a great casual meal, this is it!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have driven past this place for years.  Stopped for lunch today.  Family run,   new management this year, friendly staff, great food and the place looks great inside.  We will be back."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite spot. What an awesome place. Great food, great drinks, incredible service. Maybe one of the best bloodys I've had. Charlie kept great conversation with us, got to know us, and made sure we were happy. I canny say enough about this place. We will definitely be back!!"}
