{"text":"Loved this place when it was Salsa's.  It was small, the food was delicious and the service was always good.  I have been to Cabo's three times now.  
The first, was a little disillusioned by the fact that they only brought 3 tortillas for for Fajitas (two of us splitting) and then charged $1 when I asked for one more.  This never happened when it was Salsa's. They either brought extra to begin with or happily brought another free of charge.
Second time was ok.  We were the only patrons as it was early for lunch.  The workers were preparing for the crowd so the service was good. Food was ok.
Third (and last?) time.  Just went a couple if days ago for lunch.  Service was slow even though there were only 5 or 6 tables seated.  The chips were old (one tasted like rancid oil-my guess is that it was left in the warmer bin.  Had to actually spit it out...yuck!)My enchilada came barely warm. Didn't eat most of it.  My daughter's food was ok. 
Cabo's is just not consistently good to keep going.  Just ok every now and then is not good enough.
Nothing special here that is going to keep me coming back"}
{"text":"This once was a Mexican restaurant that I would often go to in Charlotte. Sad to say I won't be going back. I always order the exact same thing (Burrito California). Today on my lunch break my wife, son, and I went in, I placed the same order I always do, the Burrito California, and for some reason they bring me the wrong order. It happens but After the initial wrong order was taken away, they bring me a lesser version of the Burrito California that I always order, I noticed that it is missing something. I tell my waitress that something's not right and she immediately says \"oh it's missing the green salsa\" she leaves to get it for me but comes back empty handed. At this point I'm frustrated because my order still isn't right, my food is getting cold and I need to get back to work. My wife asked to speak to manager, and proceeds to tell him what's going on. He goes to the back brings out the green salsa (which the waitress failed to bring) for me to put it on myself which is something I've never had to do. On my way out he came over to apologize but it's not really an apology because he's siding with the waitress who of course tells him that I ordered the first thing she brought out. Big Surprise. With my visible frustration, and the fact that I didn't make it through half my plate, the manager never offered to take the dish off my ticket and he knows how frequently my wife and I come here being that we live so close to the restaurant spending our hard earned money. Bottom line \"sorry\" does nothing for me, NO ONE should have to pay for an order that wasn't to their satisfaction... I won't be coming here AGAIN. 94 health score by the way shouldn't have been there in the first place. 
Sincerely yours, unsatisfied customer. Rollie Boone"}
{"text":"Your standard sit-down Mexican food joint.  Solid food, but nothing special.  Definitely a good call if you're in the area and have a hankering for a chimichanga!"}
{"text":"I have eaten there several times and have loved it. The entrees are much better than the Sunday brunch. I don't feel the brunch  food has the same quality as the food ordered off the menu. I sat at the empty bar on a Friday night and had excellent drinks. Fun lunch spot."}
{"text":"Love going here for fish tacos! Wait time can be long sometimes and finding parking can also be a pain, but so worth the wait when I'm craving for fish tacos."}
{"text":"This place is incredible. My husband and I have been going here for years since it was named \"Salsa's\". Their nachos are to die for. Best nachos in town. They have huge portions and tasty margaritas. They always have drink specials so be sure to ask. Fun atmosphere and they have a patio for the summer months. This place has become a staple for us in Charlotte. Best place around!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Cabo and Salsa's for decades, best Mexican food around. Never change."}
{"text":"I grew up on the east coast and spent time in the northeast, Midwest, and south before I did my tour of duty for work in Phoenix.  I was used to east coast version of Mexican food and when I moved to Phoenix and had authentic, well I missed the version I knew.  When we moved back east to Charlotte, we tried Cabos and have been going there ever since.  We enjoy their salsa, their chips are always fresh, and the tres compadres dip is a must for us each time."}
{"text":"Excellent food, quick and friendly service.  Margarita's are very tasty and well worth the price."}
{"text":"There are 3 things I don't like in life...people who tell me II am not experiencing what I have just experienced....roaches...and roaches in my food.  Unfortunately, I experienced all three tonight.   My husband, my son and I sat outside and ordered fajita's, shrimp diablo, and taco's with pork carnita's.  My son's toppings and refried beans came with the usual lettuce, guacamole and pico.  In addition, there was a still somewhat alive cockroach in his beans.  He fished it out and its legs and antennae were still moving around a little.  When I told the manager he did not believe us and said it must have \"flown\" in.  We don't think so.  It wasn't a flying type.   

Other than that,  the service was indifferent, the soupy beans had hot dogs in them and the shrimp sauce was a watery mess.  Beware."}
{"text":"We had heard about this place and just recently moving back from South Florida we didn't like any of the other Mexican places...We were pleasantly surprised, Food was delicious and Service was Excellent...The owner came over and asked how we liked everything and we told him it was our 1st time there and he welcomed us and if there was anything we needed to let him know. So glad we found a new Mexican Restaurant."}
{"text":"The food was nothing special. Went there for Sunday lunch. They were not very busy but still waited 20 minutes to have our order taken. Then when we finally got our order the food was very bland. Then it took another 20 minutes to receive my check , which I had to asked for. Regardless to say I will not be returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"So I went to cabos for my first time and I was really impressed, the burrito tequila was so good and I had a margarita called skinny or something and it was amazing! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Friday night, no wait.  Our server was adequate, with other things on his mind than finishing his shift.  We god served, but boy did he exude how much he REALLY didn't want to be there!
The chips and salsa came out very quick.  There's some heat to the salsa, so I was content.  A lot of interesting things on the menu, that I think if they were executed well I would be willing to try.  But I got a combo of a \"burrito\" and a soft taco.  The taco was decent and unmemorable, the burrito was boiled flavorless chicken breast meat, wrapped in a tortilla (not the monster sized ones people generally expect with burritos, the regular size) and some kind of brown sauce on it.  Sort of looked like a crappy enchilada to me, but whatever I was hungry and yummy salsa and chips were not going to cut it.  Again no flavor to the side of rice AND I thought I was getting beans with it.  When he was placing our order, HE asked me if I wanted beans and rice as my side.  I asked if I could have black beans and he said yes.  My meal came with just rice.  I'm not really sure why he asked me if I wanted something and then didn't serve it...  I stole food from my mealmate and his refried beans (that no one asked him if he wanted or not) was definitely from a can... but flavorful.  The chile relleno I also stole a bite of was not very good either.  
If you want flavorful and filling Tex Mex, message me and I'll give you some better suggestions than this place."}
{"text":"i LOVE this place! i work in the area and it's the go-to spot for birthday lunches at the office and always the first suggestion of where to go for lunch in general! i have never been disappointed with the food i've gotten here. chicken fajitas are my go to, but rice with queso on top and the pollo con queso are fantastic! their salsa is also amazing. if you are feeling mexican food, this is the place to go. their staff is always friendly and despite me always asking for refills on the salsa, they always bring another with smiling faces! i would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I've only been here for lunch, but I have to say the food is fantastic! I've tried a few different entrees and was pleased with them all, everything tastes fresh and nothing is overcooked! If I were basing this review only on food I'd rate 5 stars. 
However, the server we had the last time we went was a jerk. He was very rude and disrespectful to a member of our party. The customer he was rude to, ordered in Spanish and the server seemed to have a huge problem with that. The server replied in Spanish and called him a few rude names over the course of our meal. All of us spoke a little bit of Spanish and knew very well what he said. If I could remember the servers name I'd be sure to tell you, so you could avoid him. 
It's unfortunate the server left such a bad taste in our mouths because we normally really enjoy Cabos. I really think service is a huge part of a restaurant experience which is why this place gets 3 stars. If we ever go back I'll make sure to update my review."}
{"text":"The food and service were very good.  However we have three kids so chose a Monday night because kids eat free. When our bill came the kids entrees were not taken off.  The waitress waited to see if we noticed and then when we complained she said her manager told her no because it was the 5th of May.  She offered to speak to him again and he again said no because it's cinco de mayo.  He never came to the table to offer an apology. There were no signs saying Kids Eat free wasn't valid on cinco de Mayo.  Bad customer service.  Sneaky manager.  Poor management that he didn't even come over
Won't eat there again based on principle."}
{"text":"I am personally obsessed with Cabo's.  Very authentic Mexican dishes available!  Great beer specials, good for kids and the food is incredible.  On Saturday night's they  have live music and it makes for a fun dinner!  Two outside patio's are awesome for a fabulous outside night if you are in the mood!  One thing I also really appreciate is that the owner is always walking around the restaurant helping out with no hesitation and is always very friendly!  I would recommend Cabo's to anyone!!!"}
{"text":"One of favorite places to eat. Very good food and friendly staff. This is always a option in my house."}
{"text":"THE SIGN CHANGES COLORS!  The little things excite me, but I love the rainbow color-changing sign.  Apple maps tried to get us lost on the way to Cabo's, but the Yelp reviews were so good that we persevered and found it.  It's on the side of the shopping center (left at Party City if you're following Siri's directions).  We have both been hungover all day and I was craving Mexican food.  I'm so glad we ended up at Cabo's.  The salsa is so good.  I want to swim in a bowl of the salsa.  I love salsa that has a present cilantro taste, a strong tomato flavor, and just a hint of spice.  Many other Mexican restaurants I've been to have subpar salsa...not Cabo's.  The BF ordered Fajitas Supreme.  He was pleasantly pleased with the amount of shrimp that came out.  It appeared to be a rather healthy serving of meat and a nice mountain of shredded cheese on top.  I ordered the Burrito Tequila.  There were a few bits of grisly chicken, but other than that it was fantastic.  The chipotle sauce added a lot of flavor to the mix.  We both agreed the rice was delicious.  We sat outside as the inside area was a little too noisy.  Some guy was playing guitar and signing, but he simply added to the cacophony of sounds more than anything.  Overall, still a solid 5.  I'm not often in this area, but Cabo's has made the short list of places we'll gladly return to next time we're here."}
{"text":"This place has great table side guacamole and the salsa is good. We order the house margarita with there homemade mix which are some of the best margaritas I have had. I will come back here just because of those. My wife order a salad and she said it was great. I ordered the faita chimichanga which was also delicious. The servers are always great. I would recommend people to come eat here."}
{"text":"Had some awesome nachos tonight. Modified the order and it came out perfect...they were great!"}
{"text":"Have visited here for several months and I am finally getting around to reviewing. The staff is fast and friendly. Over the last year I have seen the food and service get tremendously better. The manager noticed I became a regular and has introduced himself and always asks how my experience is. Its great for a quick bite or to have a cocktail after a long day at their bar. The atmosphere is great if you like to sit at the bar, at a table inside, and they have outdoor, covered seating with televisions so it is great for summer as well!I love Mexican food, but the staff are what keep me coming back!!"}
{"text":"The fajitas are amazing! The cultural interior design also adds to the flavor ;) great place to eat at!!"}
{"text":"Very mediocre mexican joint!
I wouldn't go here because of the friendly service or delicious food but because of convenience. Everything on the menu is so-so so if you are craving mexican food, it might get the job done but don't expect anything spectacular."}
{"text":"Fun and kid-friendly! 
We usually go on the weekends where there is a lounge singer (who we found terrible until we had kids and they LOVED the music!). Plus, it's loud enough to where any whines or cries can't be heard (haha....but really. That's important if you dare to go out to eat with a baby and a toddler!). There's also a nice patio and a bar area as well. Food is always yummy with lots of authentic and tex-mex options."}
{"text":"We live pretty close but have only been to Cabo's twice now.  I absolutely am a big fan of this place!  Our most recent visit was on Saturday 1/19/13.  We were immediately seated, there were not many tables left as it was packed!  Chips and Salsa were immediately placed on our table, I love their chips and salsa, not my favorite, but I still really enjoy them!  They are quick to refil as well. 

I ordered a mixed drink from their menu as I did last time, but this time it came in a small glass whereas the last time it came in a huge bowl sized glass!  I wish their menu would designate the sizes, prices, etc. so you have an idea of what you are ordering.  Sometimes you want to share for a big drink and sometimes you just want a small cocktail.

Their food is awsome, I really love the flavoring that they put on their chicken!  I ordered the fajhita chimichanga and Kevin got one of their plates that came with a bunch of different items.  Both plates were excellent.  You get plenty of food for the price, I had plenty to take home with me for another day!

We will be back, hopefully sooner than our probably 8 month hiatus!"}
{"text":"Pretty good!

·Chips and sauce- delicious & complementary

·Quesadilla- cheese, rice, grilled onions, cilantro - yum! Side of veggies- yuck

·Fish tacos- my friend said she's had better, but they were good"}
{"text":"Cabo's never let me down. I was my fourth visit for lunch. I ordered chimichanga with shrimp, and my husband pollo a la crema.
Always bring to your table free chips and salsa. I was starving and asked guacamole to dip the chips. And it disappointed us. No tasteful, no flavor. $7 thrown away.
My chimichanga could have more veggies but it was just fine. Different choice, affordable prices during lunch."}
{"text":"This is the second time we've gone, and both times the food was ok. The guacamole at the table was tasty, but the fajita steak could be a bit more tender. We had to ask several times for tortillas as the other people around us got theirs before us.

But the most annoying part of our visit is that we purposely ate out for my son's 12 birthday. I told someone right away that it was his birthday, and he sounded excited and positive about it. They did nothing special for it at all. Usually there is some singing and fanfare at the table, with maybe a small dessert. Nothing. Later the waitress claimed she had no idea. I did not realize I should tell multiple people about the birthday. It's the little things ...."}
{"text":"Very good food! Salsa is very good, but has a lot of cilantro  (which I love). Large portions and they don't skimp on meat!!! Tons of steak in the chimichanga. YUMMY!
Live music on Friday evening which was good.
I recommend this resturant"}
{"text":"We've been here three times since the name change to Cabo's. Frankly, the second and third trips happened because we forgot that we weren't going to go there again.
Interior decor is nice and fresh, although one row of booths along the righthand side is ablaze with spotlights that glare in your eyes; don't sit there! There is a bar area, and TVs around the perimeter of the entire place. They DO have wifi, which is great.
The food is what's disappointing. It is either bland or mushy, depending on what you order. The soup we had with fish tacos was very oily/greasy. We exchanged it for chicken soup, which was salty salty.
This place serves best as a lunchtime stop for the working crowd and construction workers. Not a destination for dinner out with your spouse or date."}
{"text":"I've been there with my wife and we really enjoyed the food and ambience. Would love to go there another time!!"}
{"text":"Very good Mexican restaurant ! Reasonably priced as well. Also clean. We will be back for sure, next time in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I decided to visit here for lunch today and I was very pleased! 

I got there around 2, immediately sat down and received warm chips and very delicious salsa...I just decided to play it safe and ordered the Speedy Gonzales which includes a taco and enchilada with rice and It was at my table before I knew it!

The portions were huge!!! Lots of rice, and yummy meat in both the taco and enchilada and the sauce was delicious! 

For $5.89 at portions sizes like this I'll definitely be back and I'm excited to try some of the other options on the menu!"}
{"text":"My husband and I and a couple of our friends went to Cabos on a Friday night. There were several people waiting to be seated when we got there so went to the bar to get a drink. $2 Bud Light Lime, $9.99 for a skinny margarita, and $5.99 for a Bob Marley, were the specials that night. 

I got the Bob Marley which has 3 kinds of Malibu rum and is very colorful and tasty. I always appreciate non-beer specials :). 

We were served chips and salsa at the bar until the hostess came over and told us our table was ready, which was maybe 15 minutes after we first arrived. 

It didn't take long for us to place our orders and get our food. I got the Lomo Saltado which is steak, peppers, rice, and homemade potato wedges. I normally only order a cheese quesadilla at Mexican restaurants (a self proclaimed particular eater), but this meal is amazing. 
I also get it knowing we will have leftovers for my husband to eat the next day because he loves it too. 

My husband and his friend got the tequila burrito, which is very good but spicy, with 2 sides. My husband said he also loves the California burrito which is not spicy. 

Even with the bar we were out in an hour and I felt we got an excellent service and good prices. This is definitely my favorite Mexican place in South Charlotte."}
{"text":"This restaurant is close to the house so I've been a few times. It is ok. My last visit was for brunch a couple of weeks ago. It was decent. The food was plentiful and seemed pretty fresh but it was just basic Mexican buffet fare. It is economical for a Family brunch out.  Sunday brunch is my thing and this one just didn't do it for me. I think I will keep this as an inexpensive lunch option."}
{"text":"Have been there twice since thet changed their concept.  The food is as good or better than before.  The service  has been way off.  Food comes out fast, but drinks never get refilled and we had to ask for our check twice.

Second visit was with a larger party.  Pretty much the same situation.  WARNING, drink prices aren't on the menu.  We ordered skinny margaritas and were stunned when we got our bills.  A medium was $17 and a large (ordered by accident) was around $24.  That really turned us off from making it a fun happy hour hang out.

That being said, still my favorite goto for fast good Mrxican food...and one diet coke."}
{"text":"My daughter works in the same strip mall and recommended this place.  My friend got a typical enchilada combo and seemed to enjoy it.  But I...I got the tender and delicious carnitas fajitas! That meat was so good, tasted like it had just a hint of cinnamon, cooked with plenty of onions and jalapenos.  Rice and beans were standard fare, the guacamole was of a higher grade than normal baby food looking guac you get at so many.  And, the lettuce and tomato looked very fresh. 

Folks, sometimes it is those little things that make a meal great or delicious, and mine was!

We each had one drink (Pina Colada and a Bob Marley), both good. Service was fast, but not rushed. 

We'll be back next trip to the Queen City!"}
{"text":"Pretty good. The shredded chicken chimichanga with queso was great. We went for a birthday and their birthday treat was ice cream with sweet chips and they brought out a large sombrero hat. It was nice."}
{"text":"I just found this place...took me long enough!! Tucked away behind the shops on Pineville-Matthews in the Planet Fitness shopping center. Good food, BIG portions, very good service, hustle-bustle atmosphere, if you like that (like I do ).  Prices are much better here than in many of the other Mexican restaurants in \"snootier\" locations. This will be my new, local Mexican go-to."}
{"text":"I hate Mexican food but I went here for my wife and loved every bite. California burrito is amazing."}
{"text":"Food was great.  Had a salad and my friend had the vegetarian quesadilla.  She didn't like it too much, but I thought it looked good.  It had fresh spinach in it.  My salad was like fajitas in a salad..yummmm.  This was our first visit.  I am sure we will be back.  The biggest downfall was the singer who couldn't sing.  He was so loud!!!  It was hard to have a conversation, but we did our best."}
{"text":"Arrived for an early dinner! One other customer and us. The chips and salsa were good and bad. First basket warm fresh and especially tasty with the house salsa. Second basket cold stale and left in the basket. Service was also good and bad. Our order was taken promptly and served equally as fast. Unfortunately, we waited longer for our check and to cash than it took to order and get our food. The Carmallita's Burrito was ordered with shredded chicken and was very satisfying. The Tequila Burrito was prepared with chicken breast with a smokey mesquite sauce. The chicken was diced so small it was crunchy and the lack of sauce made the dish a solid \"2 stars\". Inconsistencies made our experience a 2.5 star experience but...it is what it is!"}
{"text":"Not sure why I haven't reviewed this place yet.  My friends and I have spent every birthday here for several years.  They are great with our group...order comes out at the same time, orders are always right.  In a group of 10 with maybe 6 birthdays here a year I've never seen a friend send anything back.

Portions are big and it's a good value.  I like how they have the standard tortilla, meat, bean, rice combos, but then have Latin American specials here as well.  I usually pick one of the options from there. 

The chips are thicker than I'd like, but still great.

If it's your birthday they give you a flaming shot!  Great place for adult birthday parties."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch.. the menu looked very good, it was on a Monday they were running a special with sizzling hot fajitas. It was for $7.99 w/ drink, I saw several customers with the steak or chicken fajitas. Since I've had fajitas at other restaurants Io decided to order the Pollo Con Queso ..mmmmm it was really good. The portion was big..total cost was $8.35 w/o a drink as I don't drink sodas or alcohol. The food was very flavorful I will come back to this place for lunch."}
{"text":"Greasy beef taco ... So much grease running out the end I had to drain twice before I dare tried to bite it . Tamale was okay but drowning in red  sauce ... Once I uncovered it there wasn't much to it ... I'm sure there's good food here I just didn't get any if it. 
The restaurant is nice and wait staff attentive - hopefully I won't have indigestion from all the grease and hate them later ... 
Not too excited about the food choice ... 
Don't recommend beef tacos or sauce covered tamale ..."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch rules!

I don't know if you know this, but Cabo's has a Mexican sunday brunch for 12 dollars!  There is horchata and I think mango juice?  They have several pork, meat, and chicken dishes, fried fish, fried shrimp, french fries, rice pudding, pancakes, omlettes made to order, the list goes on.  The food is Fresh and Fantastic."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this place. My friends, who are from Charlotte, have been coming to this location for over 15 years, under different names. I ordered the skinny margarita, which was large and tasty. For my entree I had the veggie platter which cam with a bean burrito, cheese enchilada and veggie tostado. It also came with a large portion of grilled veggies which needless to say, I never got around to eating because it was all too much to eat. It would have been plenty for two people, especially after indulging on the chips and salsa. This is a basic Mexican restaurant. The menu is very large with lots of options. The other people at my table ordered the chicken soup with fish tacos, fajitas, and taco salad. All large portions and cooked just as you would expect. Good choice for a large crowd looking for \"typical\" Mexican food."}
{"text":"I had a great experience here! Friendly staff, very accommodating and nice to talk to. I really enjoyed my huge frozen Margarita and they gave us chips and salsa to go with it. I will definitely be going back again."}
{"text":"I had Cabo's bookmarked forever and finally got to try it for a late lunch one Friday - I was truly sorry  I waited so long, as it is relatively close to my home.

Located at the back of Carmel Commons, off of Carmel Rd, the parking spaces seemed a bit narrow, so I parked at the end of the lot as to not get my doors banged up.  On a Friday around 2:00, there wasn't much of a crowd at all and I was quickly seated and then almost immediately greeted by my server.  My drink order of a Coke Zero was brought quickly and kept filled.  I really enjoyed the complimentary salsa and tortilla chips.  The salsa is a well blended mix of tomatoes and other ingredients, which is what I prefer to the chunkier salsas.  It was also not overwhelmingly cilantro'ed, which I was very happy about.  An order of cheese dip came quickly to the table and it was delicious.  Creamy and well flavored, and the tortilla chips were perfectly salted and held up well to the queso.

My lunch order was a steak Chimichanga - shredded beef in a flour tortilla, covered with queso and served with rice and beans.  The rice beans were both mexican restaurant standard issue, though better than most.  The beans were a good consistency and the rice wasn't a dried out mess.  The meat inside of the chimichanga was well seasoned.

Though I had to unbutton my pants, I did finish my lunch and it was very good.  Service was excellent.  Price was average.  I will definitely return to Cabo's."}
{"text":"My best friend and I love this place and the staff and service as well as food quality! We come here all the time and will Continue to!!"}
{"text":"1st time there and food is amazing! Best Mexican in Charlotte so far. Corn tortillas are thin which I like. Ceviche was yummy and so were fish tacos. Love the sides and love other latin choices they have on the menu. Also Cabo Margarita was great too"}
{"text":"Wow! So good.... the chimichangas and fish tacos were amazing! The churros were the best we have ever had!!! The fried ice cream was yummy too! Service was excellent and food came quickly. Great atmosphere... why would you not come to this place?!"}
{"text":"A little piece of mexico right here, but truly a refreshing different menu. All kinds of Latin countries represented. My husband got their mole sauce and it was the first time I have liked mole. A little more red sauce based, full of flavor. We ordered the tequila burrito and it was fantastic. The quest has the right per portion of spice to cheese. With friendly helpful staff, I can't wait to try new different things on the menu. We'll be back."}
{"text":"They excellent beef nachos.... A great place to watch sporting events and they always have drink specials... The service has improved a lot..."}
{"text":"I've tried so many Mexican restaurants in the surrounding area & Cabos leaves me blown away every time. Amanda makes the bar, drinks & experience better in every way. Her optimistic energy & try hard attitude keeps me returning. Keep up the phenomenal work!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was pretty packed when we arrived on a Friday night. After a 10 minute wait, we were escorted inside. The restaurant was not so large but packed with lots of tables and tiny chairs. The walls had a couple of Mexican paintings but the ambiance wasn't much decorative.

We were a party of four and ordered different dishes. It took a long wait before the food arrived. We were munching on the chips and salsa. Chips were hot and thin but didn't have much flavor in them.

The food arrived in about 25 minutes and the waitress helped us out with our food remembering all that we ordered. The veg fajitas were bland and didn't have much vegetables other than cucumber, capsicum and onions. The veg quesadilla just contained spinach. There were no sauces or guacamole given with it. The food was too dry.

I would not recommend coming back again here.  Not a good experience overall"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in Charlotte! My family and I have been eating here for over 20 years. Service is always top notch and the food quality and quantity is consistent and delicious. There is always  a manager or 'owner' roaming the floor. My go-to favorites on the menu include the Burrito tequila , chicken and steak fajitas and when I am keeping it simple I grab the hard shell tacos a la cart - with a side of guacamole. Every experience starts with homemade salsa, amazing queso and warm chips and their margaritas are huge...made with homemade mixers- agave syrup and citrus juices. Great job Alfredo, Ramon, and Fernando!"}
{"text":"I've been a long time customer, of cabo's, but feel that its gone down hill as of late. I used to think the food was excellent, but now it just seems to be at the level of okay.

Today I ordered the fish tacos with tortilla soup for lunch. The tacos were boring, just whitefish in a flour tortilla. They had very little seasoning, and could definitely have benefitted from some additional components. The soup has always been a favorite of mine, but today it just seemed kind of haphazardly put together.

The food is not bad, and I'm sure I'll be back, it just seems as time has gone on cabo's has fallen into a certain level of apathy."}
{"text":"We love Cabos!  We go there all the time.  The top shelf margaritas are great."}
{"text":"Food was not very good.  Used to be better.  Chicken burrito had good pcs. of chicken in it and nothing else. The red sauce on top tasted like ketchup!  I had to get it off, NG! 
The Beef in the taco, yuk.   Chips and salsa were good.  Fresh cilantro was good at helping out the food and rice a little.    
Won't go back."}
{"text":"First time here and probably last (unless a friend insists). I got the shrimp fajita taco salad. The shell was stale and not even warm. So I ate the salad with the chips. Way too much guacamole (which I love) and sour cream. Queso came with it which was delicious! But it's not difficult to melt cheese. Service was mediocre. Like previous posts, my drink was never refilled and when my waiter never came by with my bill, the manager took my credit card and handled it."}
{"text":"Regarding the food, we found it to be good.  We had the burrito California and Carnitas fajitas.  Both were flavorful and the portions were generous.

The low point of the experience was the service.  It was not at all busy, but we found ourselves searching for our server on more than on occasion.  When we were ready to go, we had to flag down the manager to get our check and process the payment.

Because the food was good, I think we will give it another try.  I don't believe it will be soon."}
{"text":"Honestly I use to love coming here but my recent visit was just horrible. I was greeted and sat in the corner. Then my server came over. Didn't even ask how I was or anything he just stared at me for a second and I had to literally figure out what he was thinking. He had an attitude he didn't smile or look like he wanted to be there. He smiled with his other table but not with me?? What the heck? I think his name was Erik I think he didn't want to serve me because I was there on my own and he thought he wasn't gonna get a good tip, but I tip well if I like the service, I didn't like it. I ordered a shrimp quesadilla. I got it and I started eating it, it was okay at best but I noticed it was super greasy and it looked like no thought was put into my food. My worse experience there yet"}
{"text":"Let me start off by stating THE FOOD WAS DELICIOUS.

RESTAURANT: Very spacious. There are lots of tables that a person can sit with and they are very good for groups.

DRINKS: This was quite the ordeal! I asked for a strawberry mango FROZEN daiquiri. It came out as mango and I asked where the strawberry mango one was and the waitress said it was coming and this was the regular mango. However, my friend and I both ordered the strawberry mango. The drink comes out again....watery, with NO alcohol. Really?? So I told them the drink was wrong again and it needed alcohol. They brought the drink out again with the rum on top [my friend didnt want the drink at this point] and still watery. I then had to ask them whether the drink was frozen. FINALLY THE FOURTH TIME MY DRINK CAME OUT OK. $6.75 and the manager did not apologize nor make any accommodations on the menu. Which is fine, but you should have apologized. The waitress only understood what was wrong with the drink once I said it in Spanish. 

FOOD: The chips and salsa are pretty good. You get them upon sitting down, and the salsa is a little spicy. They are not that cheap, but not too expensive. I had the beef baja empanadas and they were $9. You get three normal [big] empanadas. The value is pretty good however even in the city these are $2 maximum so its a bit pricey. Now they are a Mexican restaurant and I personally do not eat Mexican food especially if it is spicy. Luckily they have other latin dishes. I had rope vieja with yellow rice and maduros. It was sooooo good!!! I ordered an extra side of maduros [fried sweet plantains] and for $4 you get at least 8 of them.

They don't give bags for the food you bring home. Unfortunately because of this I left my food on the table. $35 for just myself. An entree, appetizer, and drink. It was good but all that hassle, SMH!"}
{"text":"I usually do not eat a lot of Mexican food.  I went to Cabo's for a Meetup.  The food was actually quite good.  I had the chicken pollo .......  I may return some time in the future for lunch."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite and most frequented places to grab some delicious food. Cheap, quick and tasty as hell. I love the chicken fajitas and the patio is relaxing and sunny. Perfect place to grab a margarita on a sunny day :)"}
{"text":"Very mediocre experience. Ordered steak nachos. First; nachos shouldn't have lettuce and bell peppers, 6 pieces of unevenly chopped steak and super runny cheese. No pico de Gallo, guacamole or sour cream. Worst Nachos. The Taco salad was the same, the cheese was so over whelming, it became soup. Did not enjoy the food at all. Mediocre Mexican food. Will return to try the margaritas/drinks."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. Their burritos are to die for. I ate the entire plate plus chips and had a severe food baby. I wouldn't recommend buying the shark attack mixed drink though. There is no liquor in it. I drank the entire drink before eating, which should've had me a little tipsy since I'm a lightweight, but I felt nothing at all. Like I hadn't even had a sip of liquor. Go for the food not the drinks and you're set."}
{"text":"As a long time native of Charlotte this is the best MEXICAN restaurant in S CHARLOTTE offering a very good array of dishes and service is top notch! You can't match the atmosphere anywhere else.. Especially on Friday and sat evenings! You will find me here mostly every Friday night having a great drink special like their Dos xx, Bahama Mama, frozen margaritas with a corona In them! The TOP two favorite dishes are BURRITO CALIFORNIA and Fajitas are top notch! Don't forget about Les Marphel the music man on Fridays!!  Kids love dancing there!! dos xx on tap is killer! Love it! Service and managers are extremely awesome! Very good service!! FIVE STARS!!"}
{"text":"i love cabos! my favorite menu items are the ceviche mixto and the veggie platter. they are always very friendly to me when i go and i never have to wait long for food."}
{"text":"Horrible experience.  Chips came out stale and we asked for a replacement.  Still came out stale.  Waitress never refilled our drinks or checked on us after the food came out.  Completely unacceptable.  I looked up and saw the waitress sitting down with a colleague.  This would be fine if she had checked on us or filled our drinks.  The complete lack of service is unacceptable and very disappointing.  The actual entrees were just OK, nothing to write home about.  Never coming back here again.  Definitely would not recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Our family loves this place! Food is delicious, drinks are well made, service is wonderful, and atmosphere is welcoming!!"}
{"text":"We had wanted to try this place and actually confused it with a place Guy Fieri visited.   But the fam liked the food.   The food was flavorful  and well prepared.   The fried plantains were very good as were the tacos, fried chicken and skirt steak. We'll come back fo sho."}
{"text":"Just sitting on the patio enjoying some smooth tasty margaritas and a lovely double mimosa. Enjoying some good chips and salsa and Eric is out here waiting on us come by and say hello to Eric enjoy a margarita"}
{"text":"The restaurant is nice and the decor is typical Mexican Restaurant style. I had Carne Asada which wasn't very good. I lot on the dry side. My daughter had the Chimichanga and she said it was very good. The service was exceptional and the manager visited my table twice."}
{"text":"I ordered beer and a vegie platter but it turned out to be over priced greasy food. Service was probably the worst in all of charlotte. The lady at the desk yelled at my wife for not tipping high enough...if you want a decent meal or service, just go down the road. Find a restaurant with some standards. If I could give this place negative amounts of stars I would max it."}
{"text":"A solid neighborhood Mexican joint with good food, friendly service, and live entertainment means parents and kids alike walk out with a full stomach and a smile on their face. My chimichanga was delicious, the chips and salsa served fresh from the warmer, and our margaritas definitely had some punch. Cabo's might not be the best Mexican restaurant in Charlotte, but at least on the night we visited, it got the job done."}
{"text":"Not sure where to begin about this place.  (If i could rank below 1 star, I would)

First off, service was basically nonexistent. If you go, sip your drink, not sure when that water re-fill will come back around.  

Food quality is gross.  Both taste and appearance of the dishes is very unappetizing. Not sure how it's possible to mess up very simple dishes consisting of beans/ rice/ salsa / tortillas, but they accomplished it.  

The kids meal has zero effort put into it, I think the burrito was cheese wrapped in a tortilla topped with a Mexican ketchup or something ( I had no problem telling my daughter that she didn't have to finish her meal). 

By far and away the worst Mexican restaurant I have ever been to.  
Recommend this place to any enemies you might have."}
{"text":"I ordered the Don Pablo platter or a name close to that. It has a taco tamale tostada burrito and chili rellino rice and beans. I liked it very much. I ate 2 bowls of nachos they give you while you wait. If you like Mexican food this is a good choice. Plenty of televisions too."}
{"text":"Great food! I love the Pollo con creme!! The fajita quesadilla is exceptionally good!! Its tough to find a good Mexican restaurant but this is most def a great one to try!"}
{"text":"I moved my review of Salsa's to this page since it's the same restaurant but called Cabo's now.

We've always loved Salsa's, but always had two reservations about going there: 1. the bar area (where smoking was legal) was too close to a lot of seats, therefore you'd inhale smoke all night and 2. it got crowded fast on \"family\" nights.  We would usually just go for lunch to avoid the crowd.

Well, two thing happened: 1. North Carolina outlawed smoking in all restaurants and 2. Salsa's expanded!  They've added a fresh tortilla maker and a place for a live band.  We went last Friday night to see our friend's band play and it was the same great Salsa's food in a wonderful atmosphere.  There was still a wait for a table, showing that the place is even more popular now!

Menu recommendations:

Pork Carnitas - I challenge any one person to finish this.  My wife usually has 2-3 meals from it.

Any other fajita - all of them are great, but now add in the fresh tortilla experience and they are no longer \"just a fajita\".

Tacos al Carbon - a great hot sauce and the onion/cilantro combination make these tacos jump

Enchilada Suizas - when you're in the mood for enchiladas done differently with a tomatillo sauce and queso!

And, getting back to the live band, they had the volume of the band set perfectly.  You could clearly hear them, but you didn't have to shout to have a conversation at your table."}
{"text":"I don't know what to say. The foods just not that good. The service was ok. It is just a mediocre restaurant. It left us wondering if we should have just made food at home."}
{"text":"Tried this place on a rainy Wednesday evening.  It was \"late-ish\" for dinner, but the parking lot was full of cars and the restaurant was about half full.  This place seems like it would get busy (on weekends).

The menu is a bit overwhelming, but I like that there are other offerings than the regular Tex-mex cuisine, I saw some Columbian and Ecuardorian offerings for example.

The restaurant is tucked away in Carmel Commons, but easy enough to find with a smart phone.  Since it's on the end, the parking lot is a little tricky.  Could also be because daylight savings time and the rain, but it was super dark - the business park next door has a sign up that doesn't allow business parking (with a tow number).

Had the enchiladas suizas... solid dish.  Our server was also the bartender and it seems like they do double duty on weeknights, but still good service.  Refills and endless chips and salsa here.  We were in the bar area so there are a number of TVs to watch sports and news."}
{"text":"The food was AWSOME great seasoning great scenery  and great service it's hard to find a good authentic Mexican spot but I love this one. I'd recommend it to anyone"}
{"text":"My friends and i stopped in here for dinner on New Year's Day after our first 2 choices were closed for the holiday.

The space is large with a bar to the back left and booth seating throughout. They had entertainment for the night...someone singing to tracks. It was almost like being in a karaoke bar. A mariachi band would have been more appropriate.

One of my friends and I ordered a Cabo margarita which was one of the best margaritas I've had in years.

For a meal, I ordered the Cabo special dinner which was a chicken enchilada and  chicken burrito. The flavors were good but it was really dry. The cheese was not melted and there was a small amount of sauce. I was craving moisture on this dish.

Like most Mexican places around town, service was good and they kept small baskets of chips flowing. Their salsa is flavorful but a bit on the mild side. We asked for the hot salsa which was better.

After a while the music became annoying and it was definitely too loud where you couldn't hear people across the table. Also, the music should be in the bar area, not the sit down restaurant area.

So if i could do halfsies here I would give them a 3.5 but they are not quite worth the 4 so this ends up as a 3."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late dinner. Food was really good! Get the steak for the protein choice.

Our server was attentive, friendly and quick. The atmosphere was fun and lively. They have live music on some nights.

Only disappointment was the margarita- the staple to a Mexican restaurant. Their margaritas were all mixer and expensive. Only had one and walked away with a bad sugary headache. Stick with beers!"}
{"text":"Very mediocre experience. The food was pretty good, the queso was absolutely delicious, definitely the highlight of our meal. My chimichanga was tasty, and was jammed with chicken. My friend got Pollo con queso, and it looked good but had mushy tomatoes. I wish they would've been better at refilling the chips. I ordered queso but there wasn't enough chips!

My husband got the taco salad and this is why I rated it only two stars. He hates guacamole and specifically asked for none. His salad came and there was a large quantity of Guac on the top. Our waiter came and asked if everything was okay and I said \"no, actually, he asked for no guacamole\" my husband told the waiter don't worry about it, it's fine. But the waiter didn't care. All he said was \"sorry\" and walked away. That's unacceptable in my book. If there's a problem with my meal, at least pretend to care. My husband was hungry and didn't want to wait for them to remake it, but the waiter should have offered more lettuce or something. 

When we walked into the restaurant at the beginning, it was awkward. I had several servers pass by me and ignore me and one almost ran into me. Overall, I won't be back because of the service. It was good food, but an indifferent waiter really ruined it."}
{"text":"Always a good meal. My husband and I come here a couple times a month and never regret it. The fajita nachos, fajitas, pollo con queso, and the Ecuadorian dish are some of our favs!"}
{"text":"Homemade tortillas, enough said.  Very inventive menu which boarders on the weird side but it refreshing to see something new other than your standard Mexican fare. 
A tad over priced but it was really good."}
{"text":"Love this place! Friendly staff and clean restaurant! Salsa is good. Sometimes it's not as spicy as I like it but that's ok. My favorite thing on the menu is burrito tequila with grilled chicken! The red and cheese sauce is awesome together. Chicken is flavorful. Rice is soft and fluffy. I've also had their beef tacos and they were stuffed! My next thing to try is their Sunday brunch!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here one day for lunch, based on Yelp reviews.  It was a fantastic dining experience.  The salsa is homemade & among the best I've had - including in the Southwest US.  I had the lunch chicken chimichanga, which was delicious.  The rice was good & not dry (which is common for some restaurants), and the refried beans were tasty! And to top things off, the service was exemplary...even during the lunch rush!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND if you like great Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Decided on this place after we had been out running errands on a Friday night.  Stopped in here as we wanted to try someplace new.  I'm so glad we did.  We were seated right away in a hightop table at the bar.  The service was fine, the waiter was polite, helpful, and did keep my water glass refilled (which I needed as my meal was spicy!).  The food itself was great.  It was so nice to be able to order a tamale!  I'd missed the one's my best friend's mom used to make.  All in All, I'd definitely go back, the food was very good and the atmosphere was great."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time last night with my family and friends and it was fantastic! The atmosphere was great for young kids that are loud and drop things. Our waiter was super friendly and patient with us. The menu was a bit overwhelming so I just told the waiter what I wanted and he pointed to where it was at on the menu. When I got my food the sauce was spicier than I thought and he was kind enough to replace the dish with a milder sauce. I want to come back and try another dish!"}
{"text":"The food and the atmosphere at Cabo's are what keep us going back!  My family and I have moved around the country a lot and it is always nice to find a restaraunt at your new home that makes an old favorite, for us Cabo's does exactly that with their enchilladas suiza!  Fantastic dish my wife and baby girl seldom order anything else.  Cabo's also offers a Sunday Brunch that is a winner as well, a fair price for an excellent selection of breakfast and lunchtime favorites.  I am sure that you will agree that Cabo's is an outstanding place to have a pleasant meal with that southwest flare!"}
{"text":"This place was a pleasant surprise.  I had \"linner\" here at 3:00pm on a Sunday.  I was impressed with several things about this place:

1.  The menu is amazing.  Not just the standard \"commercial Mexican\" fare; they have a couple of Cuban, Puerto Rican, Peruvian, and other Latin dishes, so you are not limited to Mexican alone.  They also have an extensive drink menu.

2.  Atmosphere is great - bright, energetic decor, fun environment, nice bar, open-concept design.  It's a nice place to hang out.

3.  The quality of the food is really good, and so is the selction.  

4.  The service is good.  I was there at a weird time, and they only had 2 servers, and there were quite a few tables of people eating.  They were busy, but they still did a good job.  I'm sure that, during peak times, they are well-staffed and attentive.

I had the Arrachera, which I haven't seen on a menu since my last trip to Celaya, Mexico.  It was excellent.  The beans and rice were very good, and the meat was grilled with bell pepper, onion, and jalapenos.  They served it with a salsa that was insanely spicy.  Probably a bit much for most people, but SOOOOOO good!  The combo of the jalapeno strips and the salsa had my mouth on fire for a while.  A true Mexican experience!"}
{"text":"Up until NYE one of our favorite Mexican spots. Had extremely poor service on NYE. Spoke to manager - shook his head and shrugged his shoulders. Not so much as an apology.
I went back the next day and he asked for my phone number and said the owner would call. Today's 3 days later - and I've not heard from anyone at Cabo's. We won't be back under any circumstances. Suggest you try another local Mexican spot. Actually any other Mexican spot would be better."}
{"text":"Cabo's (formerly Salsas) is my favorite Mexican in town!  I've tried other \"Authentic Mexican\" spots and they were a little too authentic for my taste (i.e. greasy and bland).  Cabo's is consistent, fresh, flavorful, prompt and service is sufficient.  Now if you're a snooty, uppity person and need a lot of attention from your server, don't bother.  They will bring your DELICIOUS fresh salsa the minute you sit down and take your drink order.  They will return with your drinks and take your food order.  Literally 5-10 yummy-chips-and-salsa-minutes later, your food will arrive hot and on a HUGE plate.  Your drinks will be refilled as needed.  No frills.  Pretty much what you can expect at this price-point.  Something you won't expect from this price-point are the table-side guacamole option and fresh made tortillas-made in a tortilla bar at the front of the restaurant. Very nice touch for those of you looking for a more Cantina feel. We almost always go for lunch but I know they have a pretty happening nightlife on the weekends.  

Tip: my favorite dish is the Pollo Con Queso.  Spanish rice topped with grilled-to-perfection (never over-grilled and charred) chicken, topped with grilled peppers, onions, and TOMATOES (yum) then all smothered with their perfect queso (never runny or watery).  Also with a side of standard guac and sour cream.  PERFECTION!  I get it every time and it is always good."}
{"text":"This is about your average Mexican restaurant.  One thing I need to recommend is that you do not get the Charro beans. .  In the description it says they are Pinto Beans with Chorizo and Sausage.  It is more of a soupy side of beans with hot dogs in it.  The other food there is great though.  They have lunch specials and they also have a few dishes from other Latin American countries.  


I will definitely eat here again as it is right across the street from my work.  However, there is a lot of competition here in the Pineville area."}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant I have found in Charlotte. Killer Fajitas and amazing Cuban cuisine as well. Service has always been great. Nice atmosphere and great place to catch a game."}
{"text":"FABULOUS! I will return, we had an amazing experience. Our waitress was amazing.  I had a Peruvian dish and it was spot on with the meal I've had in Peru several times.  I was only visiting the area but I will return next time I'm there.  Great food, great service,  great experience"}
{"text":"OUTSTANDING!  That Burrito Camarones was delish!  They shrimp, avocado, and pico is fresh...and the Mexican rice was on point.  I tried their skinny margarita per the waiter's recommendation...all fresh ingredients and no sour mix.  That margarita was perfect!  The fish & shrimp enchiladas are spicy but won't disappoint.  We'll be back very soon!"}
{"text":"We went as a big group for lunch and overall I had a wonderful experience.  My friend and I both ordered something different and then gave each other half.  She had the Pollo Con Queso and I had the beef Taco Salad.  Both were very delicious and big portions.  The servers were great with keeping up with Salsa, Chips and everyone's drink.  Cute little place with many TVs.  I look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Love this place, so glad it's close to the house. I've been here countless amounts of times and have never had anything bad. Service is always great. The live music can be kinda loud, but that is easily overlooked for how good the food is. I could easily eat here several times and weeks and be perfectly fine with that. Prices are good for the quality of food. Gotta get cheese dip, that stuff is addicting."}
{"text":"Woooo is the best place for lunch.. 
The pollo con queso is soooo goooood
Thanks"}
{"text":"Just went here ..celebrated my birthday withd a margarya and a shot of blu tekil while.those mezicans sang to.me. heck ya:-["}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place. We had no wait to get a table on a Saturday night. Although it wasn't dead by no means. The cheese dip was tasty and plentiful. We had fajita chimichangas and they were great. Same with the beans and rice. I was really impressed with the live music. When I saw the guy setting up his guitar I got worried because I didn't want it to be too loud but he played at a reasonable level and it really enhanced the mood of the restaurant. Thanks for the great night Cabo's"}
{"text":"Delicious food, friendly staff and cheap! This is our go-to Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Food was so-so. Salsa and chips were good. One of my friends really likes this place. I was not super impressed.  Location is good. I think I would only return with my friend when the salsa band comes and plays."}
{"text":"Cabo is great when it's great but sometimes it's below average. I've had great service here and awful service ...like one waitress never returned to our table to take our order and we had to flag someone else down. The to-go is just ok..we've had missing items several times or things that doesn't taste like they usually do in the restaurant....and it's not about the temperature. 

There's not a ton of great options for Mexican around here so Cabo is still a good choice. I think it's a couple bucks overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, all at a fair value. The build your own meal with two or three items of your choice is a good way to sample everything but the pollo con queso is a favorite. Try the tres comadres dip. You will end up taking half your meal home if you do but it is so good. The singer on the weekend is fantastic. He does everything from James Taylor to Elton John, from Jim Croce to Neil Diamond, John Denver to Ringo Starr. And he sounds like each one of them. Tip him well. He earns it."}
{"text":"I have been there a ton of times and it's normally good, but the last couple times it's gone downhill. The fish, especially the tuna, doesn't taste fresh anymore. The cabo rolls were awesome but now taste cheap. I'm finding a new fish taco place, and when cabo fixes their stuff, I'll be back."}
{"text":"I had a Santa Fe Chicken Taco Salad that was delicious! The finest Mexican Food I have ever eaten!!

William S. Cutler"}
{"text":"This is considered to be one of the top restaurants in Charlotte. I was disappointed with how the food tasted however I don't eat southwestern food a lot so maybe my pallet isn't the best judge. Other than that everything is fine."}
{"text":"I so hate giving a Mexican restaurant two stars, but Cabo's was to disappointing. I arrived around lunch time and saw fajitas were on special for $7.99. Once being seated the table was dirty at which time I asked if they could wipe it down, and got a very rude look. I ordered chicken fajitas, which arrived in less than five minutes. Nice, but scary they arrived that quick. Well, I know why. It seems to me they had everything prepped and basically heated the fajita platter. The chicken was very dry and the onions, peppers, and tomatoes were so overlooked and it seemed to have a burnt smell. The side plate of rice of rice and beans was so cold and bland. I will say although the chips sucked the salsa was somewhat decent. Overall, such a disappointment."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. We did the chicken fajitas and they were delicious! The cheese dip was great and plenty. Our waitress was very attentive. We don't live in Charlotte, but if we did this would be a regular place for us!"}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed the food here! It's been a year or so since the last time we visited. Food is always great, my only issue with our last visit was my wife ordered a margarita with a Corona in it. Corona Rita which is fairly normal these days at a Mexican spot. They brought her one but failed to tell her that it was $19 and change for this house margarita with a Corona. That was very disappointing to pay the bill and her margarita cost more than our meals. Ver disappointing."}
{"text":"The food was actually pretty damn good! The service was great. I'm giving this place a 2 star review because the male host was touchy and grabby with the female wait staff and it was extremely off-putting and disgusted my partner and myself. This was around 8pm on 6/22/17 in case management reads these reviews... my fiancé and I witnessed him rubbing his hands on a few women who looked less than thrilled about it..."}
{"text":"Not really impressed, food was really bland. Lack of flavour. There are lot of good mexican restaurant around, will not be back"}
{"text":"LOVE this place and the service. It's the only Mexican restaurant I enjoy in the area. You can't go wrong with a single thing on the menu and the service is always great. Food is fresh and never ever disappoints."}
{"text":"Amazing food, awesome service.  Management is on point!  The restrooms are ultra clean and well stocked.  The servers were patient and very knowledgeable.  I highly recommend Cabos for your dining pleasure."}
{"text":"Extremely fast service both times we have been here. The food is hot, fresh, and fast. Service is excellent! We will definitely keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for several years- love it!  The food is always fresh and tasty.  Some favorites are the fish tacos and sopa de pollo...  Also, the margaritas are great.  

Service is pretty good, but at times it seems the wait staff can be a bit forgetful.  Other than that, great place!"}
