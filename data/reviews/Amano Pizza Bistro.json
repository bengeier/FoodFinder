{"text":"I love Amano! Small, local, pizza wine bar with great food, service, and ambiance. The fact this establishment doesn't advertise and is found based on word of mouth is my type of place! I have tried the pizza (amazing), pasta, and special of the night (a white fish). 
Closed Monday's, half price bottle of wine on Tuesdays--can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"One of the best bistros that I have been too, food was fantastic and service was excellent!, highly recommended"}
{"text":"Absolutely a hidden gem.  Thanks for the amazing food and service! Lovely wine selection!"}
{"text":"This place was great for a casual get-together. My friends and I stopped here for a central meeting place. It was small and quaint; nothing too special as far as atmosphere.

The pizza is above average when it comes to thin crust. I had the spinach and sun dried tomato pizza and enjoyed the cheese/sauce/toppings ratio. I also tried the Gorgonzola and pear salad which was delicious and not over dressed. I like the seasonal aspect to the toppings and everything was very fresh. 

The staff was great. They let us hang out past closing and enjoy a couple of  glasses of wine. Overall, I had a pleasant experience and will be back! I would love to do the monthly wine tasting event!"}
{"text":"My wife and I drove by this place hundreds of times without ever paying much attention to it.  During the day, its very easy to miss.

We decided to stop in after getting curious one day and checking the reviews on it.  After seeing that other people had good experiences with it, we gave it a try.  We were extremely happy  that we did.  Since then, we've been back a couple of times and we have never been disappointed.  I'm happy to see some very good food in the baseline corridor.  

The pizza is good.  Thin crust, light, and flavorful.  We also had fried provolone for an appetizer, which was amazing, and the balsamic strawberries for dessert.

Do yourself a favor and give this place a try... you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"So the first and only time I have dined here was amazing.  A friend and I shared an appetizer that was so go and rich it made me wonder if I had room for the entrée.  Then we shared the Italian seafood stew, which the staff informed us was only served occasionally.   I wish it was a permanent entrée it was that incredible.  I will be going again tonight for my second try.  Hopefully it will be as good as the first."}
{"text":"Not A Good Value.

Wow, I 'm a bitch. I just realized that I gave Lin's Grand Buffet four stars.

Over the years we have become rather stringent in our reviews. There is no sense in being conciliatory when there are so many other restaurants to patronize. Our dollars go only so far. So if you are a reader who will eat just about anything you may like this place a lot. It starts out very promising. It is neat and clean inside and quite romantic, and the people are friendly. Great date night for intimacy --just not for foodies. If you have a trained palate you will get more out of this review. If you like anything, then you will probably not get much out of this review. We love all food--even truck food. We don't discriminate, but we give fair reviews and credit only where credit is due.

Started with the breadbasket. There were 2 of us, so only 2 rolls brought. They were small and stale. We also had the pepperdews stuffed with goat cheese (six per order at $6 a plate), and the bruschetta (we chose an order with half tomatoes and half crab meat. There were two of each.)

The goat cheese appetizer was cold- not at room temperature- therefore the sweetness of the pepperdews was a bit cloying, but redeemed with the pepper flavored olive oil. A dollar a bite! Kinda leaves a bad taste.

In our opinion the pepperdews should have been packed in extra virgin olive oil and stored at room temperature--and the cheese filling taken out of the fridge an hour before opening the restaurant. The entire appetizer should be room temperature--if they had been we could have eaten another plate of them. The idea of them is appetizing, but the presentation abysmal. Side note: The bit of green  on top was wilted to the point of browning and would make Chef Ramsey cry. Flair is not as important in our book. But, just saying...

The bruschetta, for the money, was a huge disappointment. While there was a sufficient amount of crab on each slice of toast, the bread was not fresh, it was not piping hot, and the crab was absolutely frigid. Crab should have been warmed up first, then served over PIPING HOT, TOASTY bread--which it was not. The crab was (obviously fake) another kind of flaky white fish. Barely passable. The garlic was abundant and good. The tomatoes were sweet cherry tomatoes. We would take imported canned San Marzanos al fiorno over fresh cherry tomatoes any day of the week. Just a disappointment.

My Sicilian husband pronounced the bruschetta as an  Italian would (broo-SKETT-ah). The waitress passive-agressively shamed him, by repeating it twice as most Americans say it (broo-SHETTA), which only showed her ignorance. Otherwise, she was extremely friendly and talkative and the service was consistently good throughout our meal. I am being very fair here. She was truly nice, but she was sort of clueless.

Our California Chardonnay was $29 for the bottle and our server described it as oak barrel aged. It had zero oak--so we think our server possibly made a bit of a mix up there. Anyway, it was just \"okay\". I expect a lot more for the money, but even then, we still consider $29 for a bottle a low price/every day price and yet it should have been better, but then wine is totally subjective in our humble opinion.

We ordered a margharita pizza because we didn't think they could possibly disappoint us with something as beautiful and simple as tomatoes, fresh mozzarella and fresh basil. Oh boy-- it was PRACTICALLY INEDIBLE!

The crust was decent, even a bit blackened on the bottom like we like it. And that's where that ends. The cheese was a fancy shred blend--like something you'd buy at the grocery store. HORRIBLE. Where were our fresh dollops of beautiful mozzarella? The basil was fresh and friseed, They put cherry tomatoes on this pizza! Not good Amano! Not good! The tomatoes were too small...too sweet. Just...wrong. This is not the pizza of our homeland. Barely palatable. The reason for one star.

In our ongoing effort to find something noteworthy we did something that is law in our book--if the menu offers creme brulee we order it, even if we are not hungry. Creme brulee is a godsend. Unfortunately, the creme brulee here is \"meh\". If you've had truly great creme brulee nothing else will compare. The best we ever had was at Cafe Cherie in Montreal. It was in a low, wide dish with a thick, rich custard and thick, hard sugar top. Amano serves a small light creme brulee with a sugar top as light as an angel's wing. If that's your thing you'll love it. The vanilla bean had a good flavor. It just fell short in our book, and again--it was frigid, like almost everything else we ate there. Amano--you must take things out of the fridge! You'd solve most of your problems if you did. We did not order the olives for fear they would be pulled from a fridge."}
{"text":"Love, love, love, love this place! Not only is the food terrific, but the entire staff makes it a fun and relaxing place to go for dinner. We have never had a bad meal or bad service. There are always lots of laughs during dinner because of the the ribbing we give the staff, and they give back to us.

Most important to mention- their monthly wine tasting is an event we refuse to miss. It's a 3 or 4 course meal, each course paired with a different wine. The food is always amazing (and never anything that is on the regular menu) and the wine is perfect. It is reservation-only event so make sure you get on their email list."}
{"text":"Such a cool little place. We stop in for appetizers and wine every so often. We usually end up getting a pizza too. I think last time was a chorizo. 
We also take the suggestion of the staff regarding wines. They turned us on to one of our new favorites that we get for home now. 
I almost hope people don't find out about this little spot. It'd be nice to have a little south side secret."}
{"text":"I like Amanos  but I'm not sure if the reason I like it would be reason enough for others to visit.

My husband and I frequent Amanos Pizza Bistro because it  is one of the only stand-alone restaurants in South Phoenix.  

It's a quaint place with personality.  And they have a nice wine selection.

The menu reminds me of Cibo's in Central Phoenix -- mostly gourmet-ish Pizzas.  However, there are some interesting gems on the menu.  If you are in the mood to try something a little out of the ordinary try the Rajas Gratin - served in a blazing hot casserole dish surrounded by toast points.  The combination of mushrooms, onions and chiles with a creamy sauce makes this an interesting mix. 

My favorite pizza is the Spinach, Sun-dried Tomato, and Queso Fresco Pizza.  I've also tried the Herb Crusted Chicken with Orzo .  Both are very nice.  My husband gets the Sausage and Penne Pasta -- it's served with a light tomato creme sauce.

My great  disappointment is that the waiters never seem to recognize us or seem to remember what we order.  This seems strange considering the place seems to have good retention of wait staff -- we see the same servers every time we go.  

The fact that the service seems aloof makes makes me sad.   In the three years we've lived in South Phoenix, we visit at least a 2 times a month. My husband and I always bring our out of town guests there.  And, we tip well.  I kind of hoped that eventually I would become a recognizable \"regular\" -- kind of like Cheers -- \"ERIKA! ROSS!!  the waiters would exclaim as we walked in.   Maybe some day.  In the meantime, at least I see my neighbors in the place and they always greet us enthusiastically :)"}
{"text":"This was a really good restaurant!  We went on a week night and it wasn't too crowded, so we were seated immediately and a server helped us immediately.  We ordered two appetizers, both were delicious.  We ordered two pizzas, both were delicious.  Very friendly staff, very good food! Will definitely eat here again next time I am in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Went there with a bunch of friends (about 10 and they accommodated nicely... yes we made a reservation) and thoroughly enjoyed the experience.  My wife had a pesto Crusted Chicken that was really good.  I had the Sausage pizza.  It was good, although if you let it sit too long the middle gets a little soggy so EAT UP.

Their specials menu had a great pesto and prosciutto bruschetta the bread was crispy and the prosciutto was awesome.

For Desert - Crème brûlée.  Fresh made, great creamy texture, although next time I will definitely be getting the tiramisu (looked amazing).

The decor was nice and inviting not too loud, not too bright.  Smelled like lots of good food so I have no Idea what was going on when Cher T. was there.

In all I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We don't make it here often enough. The goat cheese salad and the pizzas without sauce are favorites. The ever changing Bruschettas can be amazing. And the wine list has impressed an out of town family member who knows much more about wine than we do."}
{"text":"Service was sloooooooow. Asked for(twice) and waited for our bill for 30+ minutes. Hard to enjoy the dinner with frustration after the meal."}
{"text":"Amano is great. I have eaten there many times due to the lack of options close to Laveen. You definitely have to try the rajas. I also love the rolls with oil and balsamic that are on the house. Every once in a while they give a chef's treat which really is a pleasant surprise.

 I have loved the pizza's that I have eaten as well as the Prosciutto Linguine with cherry tomatoes. They have some decent art and a very regular staff since it s family owned and operated. 

They have their steady menu and then some blackboard listings which typically have a great new choice. They have an amazing wine list. My sister always wants to go to Amano when she comes to town even though there are many choices in the valley. My wife always has to have their Tiramisu even though she normally doesn't like the traditional style. 

Some things are pricey as expected for that product, but you can always get a cheap pizza which tastes amazing. I like that it isn't typically busy, but I definitely want them to stay around so I don't have Wienerschnitzel or Taco Bell as my only choices. 

June 26 Update- Food was great as ever had the Calabrese Pizza though they have many great specials like Calamari that almost drew me away. My wife had the Manicotti which was amazing, like an Italian enchilada. Very few  people, don't know if it was the Summer or an early dinner 6PM. Some people are definitely missing out."}
{"text":"My son and I had dinner here last night.  I love it that it is less than ten minutes from our house, it seems to be family owned and run, and we had tried it once before and I remembered it as being good.  

We started with an antipasto that had a nice selection of olives, some artichoke heart slivers, a few small pickles, two tiny fingers of cheese, a slice of some processed meat, a few sliced cherry tomatoes. and some thinly sliced prosciutto.  The prosciutto was so tough it was inedible and slimy, rather like chewing a thin slab of heavily salted, cold, old flesh.  The entire arrangement was dribbled with a green sauce that smelled and tasted of anchovies.  I thought I had read that it was meant to be a pesto and did mention to our server that it tasted bad and that I made pesto frequently and had never used anchovies.  She seemed mildly taken aback and returned to tell me it was a sauce verde and did include anchovies and greens.  I guess the fact that I had presumed it was a \"pesto\" when in fact it was a \"sauce verde\" excused it from being foul tasting.  

When it arrived I had asked our server, wasn't there some nice, crusty bread to go with it?  Our server seemed utterly perplexed and after some discussion did return with three cold, dried pieces of bread that they use for their bruschettas.  Really?  The bread they use comes in packages of pre-toasted slices??  They don't have ANY bread they can serve with an antipasto??

I only wanted a salad for my entrée and I ordered one from the specials menu that sounded inviting.  It arrived on a smallish oval dish and was mainly pre-packaged field greens with a reddish tomato based dressing that was not at all complementary in appearance or flavor.  There were little clumps of seeds on the top that reminded me alarmingly of the bottom of our love birds' cage that turned out to be \"marinated mustard seeds\".  There were a few slices of palm hearts and at the bottom of the dish buried under the greens, a smattering of dried cranberries.  There was not a thing to recommend in this salad.  It was such an unpleasant eating experience!  Really, unusual combinations are great, but they are supposed to TASTE good!!

My overall feeling about this restaurant is that the chef and/or owner wants a European feel and for people who come there to experience a fresh and unusual approach to dining.  But really, the bottom line in preparing food is that it should TASTE good, not just be unusual.  I lived in Europe for four years, two in Germany and two in France.  My husband and I love to prepare and cook food.  The last salad I made used red leaf, romaine, parsley, thinly sliced red and yellow peppers, scallions, papayas, radishes, toasted pepitas, crumbled raw, organic goat cheese, crumbled smoked maple bacon and a dressing of braised garlic saturated EVOO, red wine vinegar and splashes of lemon juice.  It was delicious.  The salad at Amano was - awful."}
{"text":"Nice little small Italian bistro.  Both of our dinners were really tasty and I Loved the quaint ambiance."}
{"text":"Love this little gem! Such a fun place to meet with friends and family for delicious bruschetta and wine. The staff is great -- very personable and accommodating. Great wine selection and the food is good. You have to try the different bruschetta they offer!! The pizza is also wonderful."}
{"text":"Went here on a recommendation from a friend. Great atmosphere. You feel at home when you enter this restaurant as it seems you're entering a cute and quaint cottage. A very Mom and Pop feel. Ordered the Tres Generations Margarita and it was phenomenal. Not sweet nor dry...just right. They brought some bread over (which seems to be made fresh there) for something small to munch on. The Antipasto salad was authentic.  Great deli meats, olives and cheeses.  There is no lettuce except for the small portion in the middle where the delicious seasoned tuna sits. I ordered the prosciutto and herb crusted chicken breast. The chicken was very tender and juicy. This is how chicken should be made. The fresh veggies were good and fresh. I definitely will be back and will look forward to try the pizza next. Looks Yummy!  Tess was very nice and super sweet. I gave it 4 stars only because I wish the bread came out warm instead of cold ;-)"}
{"text":"Given the choices in this part of metro Phoenix, OK. Every time we eat here we seem to have a big bill without much food excitement to go with it. Maybe it's because we ordered drinks before dinner but please skip the G & T. The food is just OK, much worse than our own home made. The pizzas rubbery and salty, fish drowned in a soggy sauce. I did enjoy the steak salad and brand new fresh artichokes but look out for the overwrought, the overpriced, and the overcooked."}
{"text":"This out-of-place pizza joint is a hidden treasure! My boyfriend and I have gone twice (in one week) and have thoroughly enjoyed every minute of our experience. The pizza is so good, I have no desire to try anything else on their menu. Both visits, we have gotten one appetizer (goat cheese stuffed peppers and stuffed portabello caps-a special) and shared a pizza (prociutto and artichoke & poblano peppers and mushrooms); every bite has been delicious! The value for the price is very good, $12-$15 for most of their pizzas. Don't miss this place, very traditional italian pizza--the crust is perfect: thin enough so that you can fold it in half to eat but thick enough so it doesn't break like a cracker. Yum!"}
{"text":"Won't go back...between the 4 of us, we got the bruschetta, the fried cauliflower, 3 pizzas, (the sausage one, the salame one, and the artichoke one), the pork tenderloin dish, the creme brûlée, and the chocolate dessert. The bruschetta topping was good, but the bread was way too hard and crispy...when you bite it all the toppings come flying off and the toast cuts up your mouth, as opposed to the nice grilled bread it should be. The cauliflower had a burnt taste about it...the pies looked like they would be nice n crispy, but instead were doughy n chewy :/ the salame one had good toppings, the other two not so much. My friend said he enjoyed the pork dish, I did not try it. The chocolate dessert was good, but the creme brûlée was not set, it was custard on top and soup underneath :/ probably because of the deep coffee mug it was cooked in...cute, but not practical. 

I would not have bothered writing this review had the bill been about $50 less...feel kinda ripped off. All this being said, the waitress was very nice and bubbly, the food is just an unfortunate let down."}
{"text":"Cozy place. Friendly staff. French chef cooking Italian food. My favorite the hand made pizza but also all kind of  well executed appetizers: goat cheese peppadew, mussels white wine with creme sauce, bruschettas. You can order the specials, they're always a safe and surprising choice. Interesting wine selection. You also taste south of France and spanish influences. Overall great food for the money, I greatly recommend."}
{"text":"We recently moved to the area and actually bought our first home in the neighborhood behind Amanos. We decided to celebrate our purchase by walking to the resturant. The ambiance is cool, cozy. Waitress was friendly and helpful. The prices are slightly higher than they should be, but the quality and taste if the food makes up for it. Great wines, great pizzas. I recommend the large pizza on semenoia crust for 2. The cherry tomatoes are fresh and wonderful. We try to dine here at least once a month."}
{"text":"Amano's is really very good. We had a lovely dinner and glass of wine. Excellent service and food."}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place!  The food is fantastic and the treat us like family"}
{"text":"Nice and relaxed. Not to stuffy. Very Casual. I will come back for a quick bite with a glass of wine."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is comfortable, the staff is consistently friendly, the presentation of the food was gorgeous and the food is fantastic. I have been to Amano several times and always return because you really can't beat the quality of fresh ingredients used at such a moderate price. It is a quaint restaurant that is nice for both a date location or family dinner. I recommend always trying one of the specials!"}
{"text":"Haven't been back here for a while. Went on Friday, horrendous service, no silverware, no water, no order taking, no one brought our check to the table, when they finally did, no one came to pick it up. Seemed like they were too busy with other things. Food was decent, but after the service we got, seemed horrible. No management whatsoever! What a shame!"}
{"text":"My previous review was based on a visit several months ago. At that time everything was mostly OK, but not outstanding. 
We went again tonight and some dramatic improvements in the food justify an update. 
We had the caprese salad, medium size antipasto, and the pear + prosciutto +  goat cheese + pizza,  and the steak in pepper and cheese sauce with fingerling potatoes from the special menu. As a dessert we had the tiramisu. Or rather, *I* did because after one bite I tried to keep the sharing to a minimum. 

The caprese salad - mozzarella, tomatoes, basil -  was good. So was the antipasto with several different varieties of olives, cheeses, salami, tuna (that one didn't fit in) and greens. All quite good but also so simple and basic that it's hard to mess it up. The medium antipasto is very large, easily a full meal by itself. 

The pizza was outstanding, however. Much more real Italian-style than their semolina pizzas, with a wonderful, buttery thin wheat crust, excellent homemade red sauce with the perfect level of oregano, and thinly sliced pear, chunks of goat cheese, wonderful prosciutto, and uncooked spinach leaves. The taste and mouthfeel was divine and the experience was a very pleasant surprise. Most pizza places in Phoenix make an Americanized and standardized version of pizza, and that's fine. But what I got to devour at Amano tonight was more like what you might get at a pizzeria in Italy.
There are also some finer pizza places in Scottsdale that make pizza like this. But for the part of the Valley Amano is located at (South Mountain / Baseline corridor), this is as good as it gets - by far. 
 
The steak was enormous, and the house sauce very flavorful. They call it pepper and cheese sauce but it tasted like butter blended with an angel's song. Ok that's a bit much but it was indeed excellent. 
It knocked my wife's usual favorite steak from The Cheesecake Factory (steak diane) to second place. 

And finally, the tiramisu. OMG! I'm a dessert fiend and tiramisu is one of the goodies I tend to find fault with when I order it at some other Italian restaurants in the Valley. And honestly, it's pretty easy to mess up tiramisu. Many other places make it too soggy, too sweet, or have a totally flavorless and goopy mascarpone. Amano got it right! Perfect mouthfeel, perfect flavor. I'm not sure if they actually used finger biscuits and that technicality would be the only neg here if that is the case. Besides that I simply can't say enough good things about their tiramisu. In fact, I might go back tomorrow evening for another one.  

The place was packed given it was a Friday night. Of course, with maybe 12 tables in the whole restaurant, it's easy to get \"packed\". Because the place is so small, the noise level was pretty high. If you like to go on a Friday night, making a reservation is highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place is like an onion. The outside looks a little rough and it isn't until you see the inside can u know how pungant the onion actually is!

As it's dirty brown exterior doesn't really scream \"eat here!\" but the huge mural on one wall does help so does the clear christmas lights hanging from it's roof. 

One Saturday night a friend and I went venturing for a nice place to dine and came upon this place. I have always wanted to try this place as there are no other Italian places on the South side besides small Pizza places. 

So we went and checked out the menu first and everything sounded good especially the risoto. But everything was moderately priced. Nearly $20 a plate. I wasn't expecting that! Most places on this side of town are on the cheaper side which makes the south side so wonderful (if u know where to go) a place to dine. 

We made some deals with ourselves and thought about what to order and what not to order and then entered...

And what met us was a smell I wouldn't wish upon ANYONE!

It was an odd mix of cat urine, burnt garlic, rancid citrus... and maybe burnt bacon? but the most noticiable was the cat urine. I put on a brave face and got met with a bit of an attitude from their tight black t-shirt wearing Simon Cowell wanna be host/server that if we didn't make reservations, we weren't going to get a table for atleast an hour. 

I looked about the tiny dining room and saw people in small groups dining and having an okay time in the dimly lit dining room. I thought about waiting but the smell was so strong! My friend said it was a sign and refused to wait for a table.

We wound up going to Sun Asian Kitchen and had a nice time. I still can't get over that smell! I never encountered anything like it!"}
{"text":"Such a cool place with nice art, good wine selection and great food. We have been here several times and always had good service until this visit when we came 30 minutes before closing time.  Definitely check it out."}
{"text":"Boy, am I surprised to see negative reviews on here.  I've lived close to and have been going to Amano for six straight years now, and have never had anything short of a delightful, delicious experience.

I usually order the pear/walnut salad and the shrimp pasta or risotto dish.  It's delicious every time.  I've also tried their pizza, some of their specials (like a seafood stew), a pork dish, etc..  This is the place that I bring dates (hungry guys) to, and they are always very pleased with their dishes.  I am a serious cook, and am always delighted by the taste, presentation and balance of the dishes served here.

The service is actually very friendly and frankly, the reason I like it is because it's not overbearing.  The same people have worked there for what seems like forever, and they remember you and are always helpful with the unique and yummy wine list.  No, they don't greet you in the same way as every other restaurant in town, but that's what makes this place so \"homey\" and comforting.  Like I said, I bring dates here, and we never feel rushed or watched, but always feel like we get what we need when we need it.  Thus, the staff supplements the already romantic feel of Amano.

For people who whine about pricey meals, it's not any pricier than anything else around (unless you prefer Red Brick Pizza or McDonald's).  Yes, the meals are around $17.00 - 22.00.  You are sitting in a lovely place with fresh flowers and quality food where the napkins are linen, the salad plates are chilled, and the wine list is extensive and extremely reasonable.  If you are going to go out and $20.00 a meal is too much for you, then look at the menu before you start ordering.  Sorry, but this restaurant isn't looking for a person of your class to dine there anyway.

If you live in the neighborhood, this is a great place for a romantic dinner, although I warn that it is also family (and therefore kid) friendly.  But seriously, their wine list is superb, and you can tell that everything is fresh and made on the spot."}
{"text":"My husband took me out on a date tonight and took me to this restaurant which is just up the street from us. it was delicious , the service was excellent and waitress was very nice. I had the choice angus filet mignon served with gratin potatoes, roasted asparagus, and a mustard cream sauce . My husband had the chicken marsala with wild mushrooms and linguini pasta . We topped it off with the rum cake with fresh fruit. we will be returning soon."}
{"text":"I've been a Chef in the valley for a long time, and this place is one of my favorites. Great dinning experience, very small place that fills up quick. Get there eairly and you won't be disappointed with the food or service. Please be aware this is not a cheap place to eat, but the price is worth it."}
{"text":"I've driven by Amano Pizza Bistro several times and the brightly painted mural on the building facing west always caught my eye. It seems a little out of place considering its location. It looks like it belongs in a more upscale part of town. I finally tried it out with my husband and a friend and we are all fans now!

It is a small place with a nice, unpretentious, and cozy feel. The atmosphere made me feel comfortable and relaxed.

The food was very good. We started with an antipasto platter that was quite impressive. It had an assortment of meats, cheeses, and several different types of olives, some I've never seen before. I was most impressed with the olives I tried and the salame.

For the main course, I had the pesto-stuffed chicken breast on top of a bed of fettucine alfredo and a vegetable medley. Overall, it was good. The outside of the chicken was a little tough, difficult to cut into bite-size pieces, but was flavorful. The vegetables were a little disappointing. Some of them were burnt to an ash-like look and consistency (a.k.a. black). I had to pick and choose what I ate. I ate a burnt piece and  it was very crispy and tasted like ash. My husband's vegetables were also like that. He had the ribeye steak and he said it was excellent...no complaints.

For dessert, I had their homemade vanilla bean creme brulee. It was excellent and I highly recommend it.

Prices are reasonable. We ordered an appetizer, three main dishes, two desserts, two cups of coffee, a bottle of wine, and a bottled beer and the bill was about $140. Not too shabby.

I will definitely come here again. The only reason I didn't give Amano Pizza Bistro five stars was because of the burnt vegetables. We all loved the atmosphere. The staff was great as well. They were attentive, but not in your face. And overall, the food was great and I look forward to trying out more dishes. This restaurant is definitely the jewel of an otherwise unremarkable part of town."}
{"text":"Stopped in with little expectations. It was raining outside and the place was packed. We got seated right off the bat and service was top notch. I met the owner who kept on bringing micro brews since I told him about my love affair with hand made craft beers. Waitress was sweet and had vast knowledge of beer as well. The food was amazing. My wife and I both had seafood lasagna my kid had the margarita pizza. Both were great! To end the night we got desert the cream brûlée and Tara misuse and again both recommended. Dive bar atmosphere but great food and service! Check it out l"}
{"text":"This is a family run establishment,  which ensures everyone there is looking to make sure you're hapoy. I went with my parents and there was zero disappointment. Every appetizer and entrée was delicious. Make sure to make a reservation as they are rather small."}
{"text":"Best pizza in south Phoenix!  We frequently visit Cibo and Pizzeria Bianco and this is a great alternative not to mention closer to home. No beers on tap which is disappointing but good beer selection nonetheless. Had the prosciutto and artichoke pizza which was delicious. Tiramisu for dessert was a perfect end to the meal."}
{"text":"Small place but good food and good service and not expensive!!! Can't wait to take the family from out of state"}
{"text":"Yum! Another wonderful evening at Amano's. Great food, friendly staff and in case you didn't know, Tuesday is 1/2 off bottle wine night. We shared a fabulous Cabernet from their Great selection. Hmmm... See you next Tuesday!"}
{"text":"We love Amano's! I'm not sure why I haven't written a review until now. The food is great! The pizzas are very good as are the pastas and meat dishes. Be sure to check out the specials menu. The service is excellent. It's always a pleasure to be waited on by Patrice- she is quick, knows the menu, and appears with crayons and coloring pages right when my kids need it. 

Try the antipasti platter. Try the AMAZING balsamic glazed strawberry dessert. 

Tread carefully around the after-dinner carmels. Most of the time they are amazing (vanilla black balsamic: omg), but I will *never* get the flavor of the rosemary one out of my mouth. My advice: ask the flavor first."}
{"text":"Amano pizza bistro is warm and inviting with an everchanging wine selection. The food is excellent.  My favorites are the rajas, pizza, fish, salads, and deserts. This restaurant welcomes all with a smile and the people are genuine. I would recommend this spot for a first date or a family meal any night!"}
{"text":"This place is so delicious.  It's small and quaint, the atmosphere is romantic.  I can't rave about the food enough.  I've tried several different items, and have been impressed with all of them.  It's so nice to have a restaurant with creative and high end menu options in our area.  This restaurant is mine and my husbands favorite for a date night. I recommend you make reservations, since this pearl of a place fills up quickly and for good reason."}
{"text":"The best kept secret around South Mountain, the atmosphere is cozy, friendly and the food is great.  We come very often with friends and family members and enjoy Tuesday nights Wine specials.  Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"This is a restaurant we have passed by many many times, and a few nights ago, my husband convinced me to try it out. It's a cozy place, yet comfortable as they don't pack you in like sardines. Not much of a welcome from the staff, nor any introduction to the menu or explanation of the specials, which I found a little odd. The place was not packed on a weeknight, so it's not like the servers were scrambling. 

After a few questions, my husband ordered a mushroom and feta pizza which had a crispy crust and was very delicious. My filet (a special that evening) was just alright. It was closer to medium than the medium rare I had ordered, had a tough exterior, and was pretty small. The Gorgonzola sauce wasn't as good as others I've had elsewhere. It came with an assortment of fingerling potatoes, some of which I liked, and some nicely prepared asparagus. Getting tired of the Gorgonzola sauce, I had to ask for salt and pepper as the potatoes were not seasoned enough for my taste on their own. I don't know why they just don't have it on the table like every other restaurant. 

I'm willing to give Amano another try sometime, especially on the merit of the pizza."}
{"text":"I have ordered 4 pizzas in a week in the half's time. Two of them came very well done where the crust was pretty hard. They have no email address or a way of contacting by their web. All the pizza's I got were to go and I live 30 minutes away...not trying anything else there. The margarita pizza was good, but not when burned! 

The pizzas were good/decent. I expected a little more from the good reviews. I guess if u live close by and don't want the traditional Papa Johns, Pizza Hut, etc then you should try this place."}
{"text":"Fantastic little place close to our home. Very intimate, and cozy atmosphere. We tried 3 different pizzas and all were delicious and tasted fresh and homemade. Their croutons were fresh baked and the bread had a fantastic balsamic dressing. Our waitress comped our desert, which was delicious, for a tiny wait which was incredibly generous. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Surprise Surprise
Attention: Tuesday 1/2 price bottles of wine
If you just look from the outside you will drive right by
It is next to a vacant lot and is very small but it is excellent
It is not for kids and not very big, only about 20 people fit but it is family run and great food.
They have a regular menu and a daily menu.
The cauliflower fritters were outstanding
We had the salmon and shrimp pasta and prosciutto with herb crusted chicken and both were very good. The pasta sauce with the salmon and shrimp was special.
Definitely a great place for date night or small get together.
See my pictures"}
{"text":"The crème brule is to die for....portions could be a little larger"}
{"text":"My friend picked up 3 pizzas for pick up recently and I am torn between giving this place 3 and 4 stars.   Here's why.  It is based on structural integrity of the pizza, taste, and presentation.  We ordered the garlic, olive oil, basil, Romano, and mozzarella pizza.  The flavor of this pizza was quite nice, what it failed on was presentation.  None of the toppings were evenly distributed, and looked liked it was just flopped on the top, disappointing.  

   The next pizza we had was the Margherita.  The flavors were good, but again the toppings were just flopped on top.  The last pizza we had was the Italian sausage, caramelized fennel, roasted red peppers, and fontina.  My complaint about this pizza is that the dough is too thin to support the toppings.  Taste was there but you couldn't pick up the slice, it fell apart.

   With all that being said, I enjoyed the taste and all but I think if they focus a little more on execution, the pizza would be a lot more solid."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I can't agree with some of the positive ratings others have given about Amano Bistro. My experience was not pleasant. As I parked outside among the open dumpers and tried to jump around the huge water filled pot holes in the parking lot, I noticed it was interesting how the front area was gated. Unsure if the place was open, I tried the door. It was open, I stood for 30 seconds and then was greeted. The server greeted with a smile and asked if I had reservations. I did. After we were seated, we waited a while to get served. We were served rolls. Noticing the vibe, the music did not go with a bistro ambiance, it was too loud and modern. It was too bright to be considered intimate or romantic. In fact at the table next to me, a business meeting of old ladies was going on. They were going over their agenda and budget. Finally after ordering a pizza and pasta plate, (we were told their pizza were their speciality), we were left confused with the positive ratings of this 'bistro'. The cream sauce on the sausage pasta was heavy, greasy and yet bland. The pizza was doughy and unsavory. All of our stomachs were cramping and uneasy as we walked out. So do I think this place is the tops? No, unfortunately not. But I gave it a try. 

*Take some Pepto with you just in case. (but maybe it was just my experience)

P.S: This food is overpriced. But I guess for some that are not in area where there are more options, it's about the convenience of the location."}
{"text":"It was my first time dining at this casual quaint little restaurant on a busy boulevard, E. Baseline Road.  Took me a while to find it with my GPS but was glad I did.  It is a free standing adobe brick building across the street from CVS Pharmacy.  Has a small courtyard where you can dine weather permitting.  We were one of the first patrons that evening but before long, the place was quite full.  Families and couples alike choose to dine here.  I ordered the Calabrese Salami pizza and was not disappointed.  The crust was nice and crisp just like I like it and the salami was very tasty.  The Linguini with Clams was to die for!  The best I have ever had. 

They serve seasonal beers and tonight's selection was an Anchor Steam Christmas Ale.  I really enjoyed it and actually had second one.  This restaurant was a recommendation from a friend who vacations in Phoenix all the time and always makes it a point to eat here.  It definitely will be on our list of places to dine when in Phoenix too."}
{"text":"Let's keep this simple. I purchased a LivingSocial voucher. The intention was to invite my best friend, Tamra. I waited until that last day to use it and Tamra couldn't make it. So I decided to head to Amano Pizza Bistro on my own. It was busy but luckily for me, I took the seat by the corner wall at the bar. Ordered a glass of Malbec and took in the atmosphere until it was time to place my order. 

Salad was delish and the Italian Sausage pizza was amazing. I also ordered pasta (like that last thing I need is more food!) -- delish as well. The restaurant was completely busy and staff were kept on their toes --- yet I received such great service and attention. First time here but it won't be the last. I look forward to my next visit. Cheers***"}
{"text":"Another great dinner at Amano, this time with my wife's parents visiting from Minnesota. Both enjoyed the meal and the ambiance of the place and wondered how we find places like this.
They had a split dish of the Chicken Masala and a split Caesar Salad, my wife had the angel hair pasta and cherry tomatoes. I opted for the sausage pizza and we a enjoyed it immensely. Great spot and with 5 check-ins here I guess you could say we like it a lot."}
{"text":"This is one of those local places that you just love to share with your family and friends. It's a small, elegant restaurant in South Phoenix that is family run. The dishes are awesome and the wine even better. The staff is so helpful to walk you thru all your options and have a great date or family night out. From time to time, they have live music with a guitarist that just builds on the ambience. It is small and if you show up on a peak meal time, be prepared to wait - but it'll be worth it!!"}
{"text":"First time here at the Bistro for us! 
A great friendly welcome at the door, about a 40 year old converted home into this amazing Bistro! Very eclectic Andy Warhol goes to Burning Man art work adorning the walls. Our server P. She was so attentive, informative. And knew her wines and options when asked what she would suggest.  The Chardonnay we chose for our meal was splendid, we both ordered our dinner from the \"special\" menu.  I had the Pasta Special House made porcini black truffle mushroom ravioli with a mushroom cream sauce! That dish was divine!! My husband had the entree special fresh grouper with Spanish saffron rice baby kale red bell pepper tomato asparagus topped with a Meyer infused olive oil! He was very pleased with his choice!  We will be back."}
{"text":"This was not the best experience that I have had here.

First, I will say, most importantly, that the food was fantastic.  I enjoyed everything I ate and the portions were generous for the price, I thought.  They have a sea bass on special that is to die for.

However, maybe it was because it was a wednesday, there was only one server on staff.  she was very knowledgeable about the entire menu and was able to steer us in the right direction.  However, it took her over ten minutes just to great us, while we watched her delightfully help another table that got in 5 minutes before us before acknowledging us, which was very frustrating.

As for the atmosphere, we came here for our anniversary.  I was quite disappointed.  It was not very romantic and we left feeling unsatisfied even though we had a nice bottle of wine to enjoy and delish food, just something did not feel right.  It was quite bright in there and the only two seater tables were in very undesirable locations.  I felt like we could not talk without everyone hearing, and I definitely heard everyone elses conversation in the restaurant.

If you are looking for upscale casual, this is definitely the place to go.  Romantic evening or to celebrate an occasion, not so much.  Our mistake I guess."}
{"text":"Trying it tonight...will update.  UPDATE!

Had a Tuesday special 1/2 off bottles of wine which was perfect for a first time visit.  The Six Goat Cheese Stuffed Peppedews were excellent and then we moved onto the Gnocchi with Fresh Sage Butter and Roasted Vegetables along with the Angel Hair Pasta with spinach, shrimp and tomatos.  Both entrees were perfectly sized portions, flavorful and well prepared.  A stranger recommended Amanos to me and I will certainly go again.  

The restaurant is small (30 people max - guess), clean and quiet with soft music playing over the sound system.  There is a bar which had a few couples chatting and the dining room was fairly busy with a little over half of the tables full.

The restaurant is located near 16th Street and Baseline and is a nice option for those of us in the south Phoenix / South Mountain area who don't feel like driving into Phoenix or out into one of the suburbs.  

Give it a try, you just might like this great little restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is so awesome !  I want to sing their praises but hate to think I couldn't always walk in and get some perfect food - no matter my mood. 

Love, Love, Love this little joint!"}
{"text":"I've been to this wine bar/restaurant before, however when I went recently there was very strong thick/humid odor. It was raining that day so it could have been the rain, but the odor killed my appetite. Service was a bit slow, but the wine the server suggested was great and the tiramisu was obviously home made and delightful. I would return... just not on a rainy day. Luckily we live in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Wonderful for date night. Delicious pizzas, wine, and amazing tiramisu! Staff was great, even when we were the last couple to leave the restaurant for the night."}
{"text":"Amano's is refreshing little place among the chain restaurants and strip mall Mexican food places in South Phoenix. 
It has a laid back vibe with a touch of style. 
I love the you can see into the very clean kitchen from many locations! Pretty professional. 
The wine list is for beginners but thats fine- they have a little of everything and at decent prices. 
So, my friend and I live right down the road and we've been so curious about the Baseline 'wine bar,'- we stop in Friday night. 
It's not too crowded- no wait. Professional, well dressed staff seated us promptly. 
I ordered a glass of marlborough sauvignon blanc at 6.50 a glass. 
We were impressed with the menu and very surprised- we thought this place would be a spagetti and meat balls kind of place. 
I ended up ordering the Spinach, Sundried tomato, and Queso Fresco Pizza. ($11)
Neesha had the Pesto stuffed chicken breast with Fettuccine Alfredo and roasted vegetables. ($17)
We were served bread with olive and balsamic and I have to agree with Sunny B- the balsamic was too vinegary and the bread was super tough. 
You shouldn't eat the bread anyways- especially if you're about to have a carb feast of pasta and pizza. So, maybe this is Amano's subtle way of making actually follow my dieting rules... 
Our food came quickly- My pizza was good but its hard the go wrong with pizza. The crust was thin-ish and well seasoned, tasted fresh. The toppings were really good but I wish they would have really loaded on the spinach. 
I needed salt and pepper which they don't provide at the table and the ones our served brought me looked ancient- seriously- they were gross and not cute at all. 
This is a cool little restaurant- bring me some fresh sea salt and pepper in a GRINDER. 
I tried some of Neesha's alfredo- which I had to generously salt, first- and it was really good. Fresh, not too rich, om nom nom. 
I love alfredo, too- So I'm not going to sugar coat here.
The real stand out was a roasted fresh vegtables that she got with her meal! They were to die for! Oven roasted asparagus, broccoli, green beans with a light seasoning. SO GOOD! 
The problem here- The portion size of the veggies was TINY- we absolutely demolished it. Amano's should cut the pasta portion in half and fill it with those phenomenal veggies! 
I didn't try her chicken but it looked beautiful fresh green pesto oozing out the side of a perfectly browned chicken breast. 
She ate the whole thing so it was probably quite good. 
I really wanted to try and creme brulee but we had boys coming over so we had to hustle home to get pretty and make our house look semi-presentable. 
Getting the check was a pain and took forever- our server forgot about us and after about 10 minutes we had to ask someone else. 
Not a huge deal but not cool either. 
I'm going to be back for sure- its a super decent place for baseline. I think my Hunny will love it and I have to try the creme brulee!"}
{"text":"Saying goodbye to our facorite restaurant. Amano's closes next week. We will miss this place. The food and wine never disappoint."}
{"text":"Some friends came in so a group of 6 of us went here.  Cool little place with good atmosphere, basic and cozy.  Wines by the glass were good.  The bread was a bit stale but still pretty decent.  We ordered a variety of things.  The antipasto plate was good with several typical items.  My tomato sausage pizza was good, not great.  Needs some spice and flavor.  The halibut over sundried tomato basil risotto with aspargus was very good but the halibut was a little over cooked.  Otherwise, most everybody liked the food.  One person ordered a dish and asked for a little spice but it was way too spicy and they basically couldn't eat it.  Her husband ate it the next day because he could handle the spice but seriously it was way too spicy for most people.  Not a bad place, would probably go back but won't drive out of the way as the location is a little out there."}
{"text":"It doesn't get better than this, really. Great menu with interesting and wonderful daily specials. Friendliest staff we've ever met at a restaurant. I hesitate to call them staff because they're far more like family. Wine list is perfect with a great diversity. Fabian does a wonderful job overseeing the kitchen while Courtney, Patrice, Tess and Erica make for a wonderful, accepting atmosphere. Can not recommend this bistro enough!"}
{"text":"There for dinner last night for the first time. Have past the place many times. My neighbor recommended the restaurant. I love the cozy feeling of the restaurant, the food was delicious. We finished our meal before the entertainment started, so we will have to come back again. Our waitress was fantastic. Nice to have a good restaurant so close to home."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been dining here on a regular basis and have never been disappointed.  If you get on their email list, you will be notified of wine pairing events which are awesome.  If you would like a couple recommendations, try the endive salad and finish the evening sharing a piece of rum cake!!!!!!! The staff is always pleasant and we particularly like dining here as you never get the feeling like they want to \"turn tables\". Go there for a relaxing enjoyable meal.

{"text":"Love it. Hubby & I always hit this place up for date night. Small, intimate, no rush, excellent food & wines. And a bonus-great prices. Specials are always delicious and employees are extremely friendly."}
{"text":"I just have to say my experience at this restaurant was horrible tonight. The waitress was  not very attentive at all. We had to ask another wait staff for refills on our drinks. She seemed to be more focused on other tables than ours.  I mentioned our bad experience to the manager and he gave me a half hearted apology..That being said, the food was awesome, the service horrible.the only positive thing about tonight is that I got a $25  gift card."}
{"text":"Lynyrd Skynyrd.  Ooh, ooh that smell.  Can't you smell that smell.

I love small independent Italian places.  I've driven by this for years, but never stopped in.  Finally, I decided to give it a shot with my wife.

We went on a weekend and were surprised to get seated right away.  Decent menu with plenty of options.

The food was \"good\", but I just couldn't get over the smell of the place.  I think it's from the dishwasher in the bar.  It's just nasty.

Definitely has potential, but they need to get rid of the odor."}
{"text":"Lived only a few blocks away and ate there a number of times.  I've had 2 star experiences where the staff wasn't very customer oriented and 4 star where they were friendly and attentive.  I love the chicken dish and also like the gnocchi in sage butter.  We fell out of going there since it just seemed to be expensive for 2 pasta dishes even w/o alcohol...other places seem to be a better value."}
{"text":"This is a tough review, but I'll keep it short. The food was great! Great pizza and pasta. BEST roasted veggies I've EVER had. It's a bit on the pricy side. The bad... It smelled like a porta-potty in the dining area. It was almost unbearable. Could have been an unfortunate plumbing issue... Good thing the food was great. We'll try it again, but if it smells when we come back, we will turn around and walk out. Two other tables complained about the smell as well. With such an offensive smell, the staff should have either sprayed the air, or simply closed for the evening. Just my. 02"}
{"text":"Good but pricey. Couple of chicken entree's and couple glasses of wine and we left at about $80. If had better for under $100 bucks but if I wanted to show the wife a good time close to home I would take her back."}
{"text":"Good was ok.  I guess  its real Italian food. We had to ask the waitress 20 questions.  Crab app was great.  Martini was excellent.  Food over priced for the portioned size . Not kid friendly"}
{"text":"This is a gem of a restaurant in South Phoenix.  We have been eating here for years, and never anything less than fantastic food and wine.  The mushroom pizza is delicious.  The goat cheese stuffed peppadeaux, and the rajas gratin are my favorite appetizers.  They have a great wine menu.  And the balsamic strawberry dessert was amazing! Nice balance of tart and sweet."}
{"text":"I used to live within walking distance. I moved. Bad decision."}
{"text":"I wish I could take stars away. Lamb, from frozen and spongey. Couscous, runny and bland. Gnocchi, bland and disappointing, like the service. The service... Awful. I was looking forward to eating here for a year. The first time I stopped by, they were closing early. The second time I had my whole family with me, but they were full (didn't hold any of this against them, it added to the mystic actually) finally got to try it on Nov 2nd and man! What a let down. I wish I could have had the same experience as so many others but, with my visit, there was nothing to like, at all."}
{"text":"It's been hit or miss.  The pepidew stuffed peppers are my fave and I want a double order every time I go.  Otherwise, I've had good and just mediocre food here.  The atmosphere is cool, such a small environment.  The wait staff is typically very knowledgeable, friendly, and very attentive.   Sometimes I wish they would open up the patio.  Great wine selection too!"}
{"text":"A good place to go!  I have found they have good food and good service.  Tonight I had the linguini in a red cream sauce with prosciutto.  It was a littl

I would recommend that you give this place a try because I think you will enjoy it.

When you go in - tell them that Chris from Yelp recommended you go there.  They will have no idea who the hell I am but it might provide some interesting entertainment and a good laugh or two!

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I live extremely close to this place, and it kills me everytime I drive by it because I want to stop by EVERYTIME! The food is amazing and the staff is great! This is a true family orintated business and ran that way. Peter has been there for a few months now and is an excellent bartender, he's fast friendly and will pretty much put anything together for you if he can. We went in for the pizza and salad, and started thinking about their amazing mussels, unfortunely the ran out! :'-( ... We then asked if they could do the same except instead of mussels to use shrimp, OH MY GOODNESS! Talk about amazingness!! They we cooked to perfection and seasoned just right! We could not stopped eating them! If I wasn't so full from the pizza and salad we spilt I probably would have order another round of the shrimp. He said its vary rare the cooks do special request but being that it wasn't that busy the went ahead on put it together for us. So the key here is, make sure you go on a not so busy night and see what magic that can do do you! Lol"}
{"text":"I am not sure why there are some really negative reviews of this place...Sure, its not a super fancy 5 star place, sure its a bit more expensive than Applebees, but the quality is unmatched in South Phoenix.

Great wine options, many of which are reasonably priced between 6.5-8 bucks for a generous pour.  I don't think they have a draft beer system though, which is unfortunate.I would also add that there is almost too much on the menu with the normal menu AND a lengthily list of specials.

When we first sat down, the waitress brought us \"a taste from the kitchen\" of focaccia (great taste, nice customer service!). Ordered the antipasto platter for a table of 4 (again, great service, we were about to order the large platter when the waitress recommended the medium platter for a party out size.) Nice selection of olives, pickles, cheese, and the best artichoke hearts I ever had.  I liked the green chimichurri.  My only complaint is the plate would be better suited with crusty bread instead of dinner rolls.

Ordered 2 pizzas to share for the table.  Both were very good and had a great crunchy thin crust.

Skipped dessert this time, but again we got a \"a taste from the kitchen\" of the most AMAZING caramels with a salted cookie crumble on top.  If this is any indication of how awesome the other desserts are, we totally missed out.

The bill came out to about 22 bucks a person including the appetizer, 2 pizzas, and 3 drinks and tip and tax.  Looking forward to coming again to try the entrees and dessert."}
{"text":"We loved this \"off the beaten path\" gem! A great authentic Italiano experience. My mother and I recently returned from 12 days in southern Italy and we both agreed that Amano was definitely on par with the cuisine we had on our vacation. Three of us went and were all very pleased with our orders. We shared the caprese and the spinach, walnut goat cheese salads; for entrees we had Linguini Carbonara, the truffle & mushroom orzo, and Brandy Fired shrimp with risotto & roasted vegetables. All were fabulous, with unique flavors and great portion size. We shared a bottle of Sangiovese and when I asked Tessa for the \"less dry\" choice between that and the Barbara d' alba she suggested the Sangiovese and was spot on. And finally because we couldn't decide (and couldn't resist) we shared the crème brûlée AND the rum cake, both were exception, truly EXCEPTIONAL! Also Tessa (our server/the owner's daughter) brought us a bit of their homemade caramel (with yogurt covered pretzels mixed in) and it was to die for, yummm. The location is not in your typical \"restaurant row\" areas like Mill Ave, Scottsdale or North Phoenix so venture a little south and treat your tastebuds!"}
{"text":"We were staying a Legacy Golf Resort and went out looking for pizza. We stumbled upon this place and were very happy with what we found. Great food, nice wine selection and the staff is very cool! I would love to have a neighborhood place like this to frequent."}
{"text":"Great local restaurant.  I eat there all the time.  Called today to make a reservation and the recording said they lost their lease and they are closed.  This was a great local restaurant with really great food, affordable wines, great staff.  I hope they open somewhere else."}
{"text":"I can't wait to try something else. The BF and I were craving Italian, and something new. I've lived in Laveen on baseline for almost 2 years now and neither of us had tried this place yet. I'm glad we thought of it, because it was just right. 

I had the angel hair pasta, with fresh basil, fresh mozzarella, garlic, tomatoes, and some olive oil, I chose to add the prosciutto and it was quite delicious. My BF had the mushroom ravioli special of the day and I got to try a bite, it was very different from my light pasta, but very good homemade ravioli, very much like a Marsala sauce. We also started off with the Bruschetta of the day, which was a crab mix. I thought it'd be hot, but it was cold and limey, it wasn't my favorite, but i did eat my share. All that and a bottle of Chianti for $73, wasn't bad at all. 

The place is small, probably seats 50 max, the service was great. Our waitress was very personable and attentive, she even asked if we were just going to take it slow, which is good for us, because we also study the menu like we're taking the SAT's. I can't wait to go back and try something else."}
{"text":"Third time now. Got wow'd the second time and again tonight. Great meal. Good fellowship sitting at the bar. No fuss, no muss, just a laid back time with some great nostalgic music."}
{"text":"My family loves to come here. I don't know whether it is because the owners love wine just as much as we do, or if it's because the food is awesome!

The atmosphere here is very cute. It is just a tiny building standing alone right off of baseline. There is a painting on the wall outside, some outdoor seating and a tiny parking lot. You have to appreciate this atmosphere in order to enjoy such a little place. A TON of people love this place and it is often packed and crowded.

Every time I go there (no sorry, there is no pee smell) I get the semolina pizza. It it about 2 feet long, served on a platter that it wont even fit on. I like just the plain one, but you can also get sausage (like hand cut pieces of the same kind of sausage you'd get in your pasta, not some already cut gross kind), they will put prociutto, salami, portabello mushrooms, just about whatever you want on it. I find that the basic way it comes is just fantastic so I usually opt for nothing extra. I LOVE the little tomatos that come on it. Just sliced cherry tomatoes. The pizza is fired and the crust is thin. It is not too crispy nor too soft. It's great. The mascarpone was great as well.

Their chef is quasi Italian/French. I don't know. I speak french with him, and he has a french accent, but he's italian? Not sure the full story there. The daughter of the owners will most likely be your waitress, and I see her parents there every time I'm there. They are very nice and sometimes sit to dine with us. Their daughter is the red head wearing black in the picture someone posted here. 

I just love this place. I don't know if it is the atmosphere or the food or what but this place just rolls together so nicely. I will go there time and time again."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here this past Saturday for my birthday dinner and were less than enthused. Our waitress was just.... Odd. First neither of us could hear what she had muttered when we entered the restaurant. She asked us if it was just the 2 of us. Then we were sat and she took our drink order. I had asked for a glass of the \"Pink Table Wine\". She looked at me like I was nuts and insisted that they don't have pink wine. I pointed it out on their wine list and she said, \"God I hate that he calls it that\". My husband ordered a lemoncello. We waited about 10 minutes before she came back and asked if we decided on what we'd like to drink. We told her that we already placed our drink order with her 10 minutes ago. We told her again what we wanted and she tried to rush off, but by that time we had decided on what we wanted to eat. The food was served to us by someone else. The waitress kept trying to take away my husbands unfinished lemoncello, just to bring him another \"on the house\" later. After we were done picking at the food, which was actually pretty good, we ordered Creme Brule. She brought the desert to us, we said, \"It looks delicious!\" she said, \"It better be!\". We fished that. Sat for another 25 minutes waiting for her to bring our check. Nothing. No acknowledgement. So we walked to the front of the restaurant where she met us. The bartender/manager? Checked us out. I would order food to go, but by no means do we plan on sitting and waiting inside of this establishment like we did this past Saturday."}
{"text":"We went for date night. I liked how small and quaint the location is. You don't feel the restaurant chain or corporate vibe. 

As soon as as walked in we were greeted by the a staff and the waitress sat us. The tables had diverse group of people and there was a duo playing live music. 

The waitress suggested a specialty beer for my husband and he went with it although it was a bit different than what he normally gets. 

The food was delicious and have no complaints on the fake or quality.  Biggest issue was and seems to be the trend is that the wait staff is very very slow to refill you'd drinks. My mouth was dry and I really do good they fix this as I would have given them a higher rating if it wasn't for that."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant, and almost hate to review it because I want it to stay a secret.  It reminds me of many of the restaurants in Alaska, where I'm from.  It is small, not in a fancy building, yet it still has a simple, elegant feel to it.  They usually have a good band, and the food is excellent.  Amano's serves the best seafood I've had since Alaska.   Their dishes are always cooked well, and served with perfect sauces and vegetables.  The staff is lovely, helpful, attentive, but not overbearing.  I'd eat here every night if I could!"}
{"text":"I'm still here!

4.5 stars.  (Initially wanted to give 5 stars, but an incident happened soon after I sat down, which I won't mention here, but if you're interested in finding out what, just PM me!)

Came in for dinner and found a group of people standing around the bar area.  Waiting to be seated, I finally made eye contact w/ the 
group, which led to someone asking me if I was there for the art event.  I quickly said no and scanned the layout for posts regarding the art event, and there it was-- \"Meet the Artist, 5p-6p, wine and apps served.\"  Before seating myself, I asked if I could still take advantage of the event and was told a resounding \"Yes!\"  Cool!

Wine was offered quickly (white Torrontes, red Montepulciano D' Abruzzo).  Server Tess told me about the white selection, but was going to get back to me about the red, which they were \"changing out\" at the moment.  Someone (Chef Fabian?) must've alerted her to my choice of red on my last visit, bec. Tess came back w/ a half-glass of the red.  Didn't like it though, so I asked to try the white and found it satisfactory, so she promptly brought me a half-glass of it.  (I am currently sipping on my THIRD half-glass!  LOL.)  Apps, which I was told was going to be bruschetta, took awhile to come out [around 545p, actually, and AFTER the comp table bread and JUST BEFORE I received my ribeye steak salad entree ($13), which, for the most part, looked good (the meat slices didn't look that particularly attractive) and, more importantly, tasted good, as well!  The salad is comprised of 6 oz. of ribeye, organic mixed greens, artichokes, chopped asparagus, and feta cheese.]  The delivered app was actually a rectangular slice of the Semolina crust Margherita, which had a really nice crunch and flavor for a red-sauced pizza!  

I agree w/ the two recent reviewers that the balsamic vinegar is a bit too vinegary, but I just asked for butter instead, and that solved that issue for me, although I know that might not be satisfactory to those who are looking for a healthier alternative to butter...

Still vacillating on whether or not I'm to try tonight's dessert specials of Bread pudding (w/ bourbon sauce) or Hazelnut chocolate pot de creme, but I can't say that I haven't had a great time dining here, tonight!"}
{"text":"If there was an option for 6 stars, this place would get that from me :) service is a little slow sometimes but sometimes people need to slow down. A great date night place and they have live music and hang local art on the walls. The owners are super nice and the chef is a hoot!"}
{"text":"Amano's could use a few improvements. First, the balsamic they serve is cheap and only a grade up from pure vinegar. Second, put ground pepper on the table, or at least offer it when you bring the meals. 

The last few times I have been here it has only been average, I hope to see them step it up soon."}
{"text":"The menu here is great, even if unspectacular.  The pizzas are probably the mainstay of this place, so we'll start there: good crust, average sauce, and a decent balance of flavors.  However, I must add that last time we went, both Catherine and I struggled to understand why they would put figs and prosciutto on a red-sauce pizza for their special....... the tomato/herb combo sort of over-powered the delicate sweetness of the fig.

Ordinarily, I must compliment the chef for attention to balanced flavors.  The salad menu is great--although I've gotten a little bored with it over the years.  And the entrees have usually been great as well.  I recall a great orzo dish that I tried some time back.

Finally, I must comment that although it's been a while, we really appreciated the fresh fish specials on the menu.  Last fall, I think we dined at Amano's almost weekly and got a seafood dish each time.  It was great every time.  However, our last trip, Catherine ordered a cioppino dish that left much to be desired.

We may have hit it on an off night, given that our only bad experiences were on the same visit.  Otherwise, this is everything that I expect of a popular neighborhood eatery.  

*** One more thing: I hope that they've gotten rid of the tacky fat cherub paintings that adorn the walls.  Normally, Amano rotates the artwork, but these paintings were there for at least the last several months.  Otherwise, the ambience is great."}
{"text":"Went in with a party of 6 around 5:30pm. Took about 5-10 minutes for a drink order to be placed. Didn't get asked to order entree until being there for probably 25-30 minutes. Food was alright, overly salted. Service was absolutely horrible. We were never asked how our food was. We asked for our bill three times and it took 40 minutes to show up (which was supposedly being done by the owner). They refused to split our bill and coughed an attitude when we asked what was taking so long. Absolutely ridiculous service. Not worth it for the food at all. Do not go here."}
{"text":"I truly loved this place. A high end unique atmosphere and menu. What a shame they've closed...south Phoenix needs more independent restaurants like this. Sad to see them go. I've been a regular since they opened."}
{"text":"Diamond in the rough!  No one would ever think that this type of restaurant existed in south phoenix.  On 16th Street and baseline to be specific.  I am a phoenix native and grew up on the south side and put it this way, if this spot was located anywhere it would do amazing.  Not saying that they aren't doing fine now (which they probably are because they been in the same location for a number of years) I am simply saying you would expect the service and the food items to be in another location of the valley.  

You really wouldn't think too much of this place driving by it, however once you go inside it feels very \"homey\" and warm/welcoming.  They have a nice wine list to choose from, their pizzas are delicious  and shrimp pasta was top 5.  You can also purchase art that is hanging on their walls, not to mention that it is kid friendly.  I hate to use mom and pops verbiage when describing a personally owned restaurant, but I feel as if these are the most authentic!  I will always love this spot, down the street from my house but makes you feel like you're in another state when you're inside."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I have been going here for more than three years and it has absolutely never disappointed. It's the place where everyone knows your name (even if they don't), where the meals are perfection, and where you leave in a better mood than when you came in. 

Love the goat cheese and tapenade salad, the eggplant rollatini and the prosciutto linguini. And definitely the rum cake. Ahh, yes. The rum cake."}
{"text":"Been here a few times with different groups of friends, and it's always a fantastic experience. Everyone in the staff is so friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu, and it shows through how much they love and are proud of this place. Food is excellent and can easily beat other fancier places in fancier parts of town, and their daily specials are just mouth watering. Stop by and you won't be disappointed, and who knows, you may just get a lucky sighting of the chef who saunters around every now and then. Truly one of South Phoenix's hidden gems."}
{"text":"Had dinner date here recently and although my hopes were high, I was let down by this place. There was no server / hostess to greet us at the door, we didn't have any silverware available once we sat down, we had to wait 10+ min to order wine, and the food I ordered (chicken in Marianna sauce) was under-seasoned, if at all, and there were two or three gnats or fruit flies that surrounded our table and nearly ruined our night. Bad service, mediocre food and awesome location let for a unimpressive letdown. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Not bad, but not great either.

My girlfriend and I stopped in here recently after driving by it for a couple of years.  We finally decided to see what the hype was about.  

The place is fairly small and intimate, which is nice and creates a cozy atmosphere.  Based on the daily specials and happy hour, I got the impression that this is more of a wine bar type of place.  

I was excited to try the food as I love good pizza and other eclectic foods.  Sadly, I was disappointed.  We started with a couple of appetizers.  The goat cheese stuffed peppedews sounded great.  They weren't bad but I was expecting more crispness to the peppers so the consistency was a little off.  We also tried a bruschetta - crab and some type of aioli.  This kind of tasted like tuna.  More than likely it was canned imitation crab but either way my girlfriend couldn't finish one of the four pieces that came out.  I ate it all because I was hungry and it wasn't bad, but it was lacking in flavor.  So good job on the portion but I would go in another direction with the flavor.

We split a pizza for the main entrée and we got the one with prosciutto, artichoke hearts and various cheeses.  I have to say this also fell short.  It was a mediocre pizza that was rather bland.  I love putting together fun flavors, especially on a pizza, but this just didn't work.  Definitely not the best pizza I have had in town.

The service was good.  It was relatively empty when we got there and had filled up by the time we were done so it took a little longer to get the check and pay.  Overall, not a bad place to go with friends but I'm not sure how soon I would go back."}
{"text":"I came in Amano's for a pizza to go and I stayed and ate some chicken marsala.  Friendly staff and very good food.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The waitress was nice but she brought out the wrong salad. The plates are basic in size but they give you VERY LITTLE FOOD. This is not a place to come to if you're real hungry. Be prepared to spend some money. The food is VERY rich. I don't think I'll come here again"}
{"text":"We are lucky enough to live minutes from here, but I would drive miles to eat here anyway. Hands down some of the best pizza ever!! Not to mention other amazing Italian dishes (gnocchi for example). Perfecto! We also attended a set menu wine dinner, and I could write a paragraph on the amazing food and wine. Do yourself a favor and eat here!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and  I stopped in here after driving past many time.  we arrived at 7:15 and were able to get seated right away.  A man I believe who might be the owner came over and told us about the specials.  We had the calamari for starters and we shared a Cesar salad. The salad was tasty despite the warm plate it was served on.
The calamari was a bit cool not hot and thus a bit chewy. We Shared  a entrée and opted for a penne with sausage dish that was delicious. I did notice a strange odor as a previous poster mentioned however it wasn't so awful to effect our meal and I think it is something maybe from outside?  we had the appetizer, shared a salad and entrée and one soda and one drink and our tab was 44.00.  That didn't seem so bad to me until you take into account we SHARED a salad and entrée had we both ordered it would have been close to an 80.00 tab and for the service which was slow and the lack of parking and the not super special I think I would not make it a must do again.  Now I would be willing to go for maybe pizza and soda for two as the pizza looked pretty good.  Again I really liked the penne entrée however I based my review on overall."}
{"text":"I drove by this little place most days.  See all the time and thought it would be a nice little romantic date for the hubby and I.  Finally took an opportunity to go.  The ambiance of the place is great.  I like the the look and feel even for a smaller dinner place.  It is only open for dinner crowd.  They seem to have a good selection of wines which may be the only reason for me to go back.  We did eat dinner and it turned out to be close to $40 per person.  Seeing the place was a bistro when we walked in and saw pizza and pasta thought that was normal.   I guess maybe we had high hopes but they don't make their own pizza dough or pasta.  They do make pasta of the day for their special meals but other than that it's not fresh.  The service crew were nice folks but we're awfully slow.  Had a lobster mac and cheese for appetizer which looked good but ended up having a bland flavor.  Same with all the food.  It sounded and looked good but the flavors didn't connect for me.  I think the anticipation of wanting to eat at the place for months and then it not being as good as those expectations kind of threw it off.  I had even read other reviews and thought if all these people thought so it had to be good.  The food was okay but not really for the price being paid.  I won't be wasting my time much in this place."}
{"text":"This place is average. It is along a busy street but the inside is quaint. The service was a little slow but friendly. The hours are from 5pm-9pm most days. We were here on a Sunday night and it was not very crowded.

I had the calamari pasta special in a spicy sauce. The sauce was spicy indeed, but I would have liked it a bit thicker. It was runny and not very bold in flavor. There was a good amount of calamari though (sautéed, not breaded). Good neighborhood place, but I would not come out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"We are lucky to have a restaurant like this in South Mountain.  I have been here a handful of times, and the service has always been friendly.  I have only had the pizza, but it's always great.  I went with new friends last night, and some of them had other non-pizza dishes that looked real good, and they gave good feedback as well."}
{"text":"Always have a great time!! Staff is friendly the food is amazing and a perfect date night spot or hang out with the girls!"}
{"text":"I wish I had only eaten the pizza here and nothing else, because then I could give a completely positive review.  I've eaten here several times, and most of them have been fabulous!  

I'll give my bad experience first.  I once ordered a pasta with shrimp in it, and the shrimp was completely overcooked -- to the point of being chewy. Yuck.

Now on the good!  The pizza from this place is awesome!  I always order the same one -- prosciutto and artichoke -- so I can't talk about any others.  The prosciutto and artichoke pizza is absolutely delicious -- always!  I always call ahead and just in run in get it so I can take it home and devour it in the privacy of my home.  I'm glad my daughter thinks artichokes are gross, because that just means more pizza for me!  Pair it with a nice glass of wine and a movie, and I have my very own date night (clearly I'm speaking from experience)!  

I would put that prosciutto and artichoke pizza up against any pizza from Pizzeria Bianco any day!"}
{"text":"This is one of my wife and I's favorite places for a date night. The food is really good and the staff is very attentive. It's also rare to find it packed so it's great to have a quiet moment together."}
{"text":"Loved the place! 
Family oriented, authentic, and one of the a few places they pronounce bruschetta correctly!!! So good enough. 
Food is delicious
Service is very professional

The type of the restaurant you see in movies in New York so yeah I liked it. 
Good place to take your date, fiancé.
Since the setting is packed, perhaps kids won't like it."}
