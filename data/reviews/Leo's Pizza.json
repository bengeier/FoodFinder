{"text":"Pizza was not good here at all. The place is quaint which I enjoy that kind of thing, but the food was just lacking. Cheap though, so that's a plus I suppose."}
{"text":"We were recommended to try Leo's Pizza by a friend who said it was the best pizza they ever had. Today we ordered a veggie pizza for take-out. We put the pizza box on the dining room table and the grease went right through the cardboard onto the table.  It was so greasy, it was hard to eat. We won't be ordering any more pizza from Leo's."}
{"text":"Really good pizza! We always get the house special and its the best pizza around. Really good crust and the amount of toppings is far from skimpy. Give this place a try, you won't be disappointed. Haven't ordered anything other than pizza, but I'm sure everything else is equally good."}
{"text":"A for effort in staff, bringing an independent pizza place to the west side of town and providing some offerings the others don't have. First time visit and ordered a meatball sub and a philly cheese steak. Meatballs were so soft they just broke apart, unfortunately they had no taste. I mixed texture, garlic and salt. The steak was similar to Steak Em's, bland and over cooked in oil. Should not have had crispy edges. Now, I will agree this is a new place and I have yet to try their pizza, which looked very appealing."}
{"text":"Went there this week and it was pretty yummy. Order cheese bread, even the baby agreed it was delicious. The pizza was good, not anything super special but still was yummy."}
{"text":"Finally.   Leo's should be your dine -in pizza place in surprise. Cheap wine and craft beer, TVs tuned to whatever you want,  a quiet place to unwind after work and eat with family or friends, and a cordial couple making it all happen.   Super gourmet it is not.   However,  Leo's pizza is much better than the cardboard blandness of Pizza Hut and Little Caesars. If you want to enjoy a great pizza with family or a few friends and enjoy a nice glass of wine or beer in  a cozy little corner suite, Leo's hits the mark.  If you want $5 pizza, then by all means order from the franchises.  Treat yourself. Drive to Leo's and get to know your family again while you get to know a local pizza establishment that offers better pizza and Italian food at prices that are better than you'd expect. I personally think that they've spent their savings on making the pla ce nice and can't afford decent advertising.   Hopefully I can help."}
{"text":"Pizza - Sausage and Black Olive.  Good overall.  The sausage was tasty, more like a fine browned sausage as opposed to \"meat nuggets\".   Interior Decor - Location is a strip mall, and easy to get to.  Three big TVs, to watch the Saturday morning college games after my daughter's soccer game.   Prices - Reasonable.  1 Medium 2 item pizza, two drinks was about $14.50.  Good value overall.  Areas for improvement:  The hot peppers had no zip to them.  No idea why... were these WWII leftovers?  I mean... what the hell! :)"}
{"text":"We went to Leo's for the first time and ordered  the house special Pizza. It was the best Pizza we ever had. We will surely be coming back."}
{"text":"Best place ever wings are amazing.pizza Is great .always early when delivered.thay care cause they call you if there is a hold up from traffic or anything that may hold up delivery.tonight I ordered 2 large pizza and wings and salad salad was perfect cold and wind we're exactly how I ordered them .they busy there ass to make sure your food is perfect...."}
{"text":"We support small business and we're glad they opened. The staff is friendly and very kid friendly. The issue was the soggy pizza. Flavor was okay, but not the best. Menu has a huge selection. (Tons of misspellings). We'll try it again in a couple of months."}
{"text":"It's cheap! Had a white pizza and a mushroom and onion pizza.  Not terrible, but not great either.  Seemed like too much garlic salt or powder.  Olives on the white pizza, not such a great idea."}
{"text":"Check pizza for flies before eating! First slice of pizza I bit into had a large fly baked into it. When I called to tell them the manager never once said \"Oh I'm sorry about that.\" Nothing. Just nonchalantly \"Flies can't be helped, they're everywhere\" as if it's a normal occurance. I had a photo but he told me I'd have to dig the whole thing out of the trash to \"show his boss.\" So I drove back with trash in my car & he STILL was hesitant to give me a refund bc we ate three slices (out of 2 large pizzas). He immediately told the girl working there to throw it away (never took a picture \"for his boss\"). He also said he was the manager & when I asked his name he sarcastically asked me \"What's YOUR name?\" I wouldn't have been so bothered if he was not so arrogant & rude from the start. Customer service is everything and I was never once given an apology. In fact he acted like I was being ridiculous in asking for a refund. Yet we were not about to eat the rest of that pizza. So gross."}
{"text":"The pizza wasn't bad just small. I ordered the largest and it came with 6 slices. When I asked if it was a large he said yes and double cut it in front of me and said now you have 12 slices.  Same EXACT thing happened to a coworker. Rip off! More food for your buck at ALL the other  pizza places in town. And lookout cause Oreganos is coming to Surprise"}
{"text":"Went to brothers pizza nearby. They were late to open.  Do instead of waiting we came here.  Super friendly service and outstanding pizza.  I'd go here again in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Love their pepperoni pizza! The sauce is really good with rich flavor. The dough is crispy. Love their salads. We've gone to Leo's more often than the other spots in the area. One small complaint: Gotta turn that A/C down to a comfortable temperature during the 110 degree summer."}
{"text":"I would say you can't really judge a pizza place by the slice cuz I'm normally sitting around for a while on the reheating but I would assume that these were fresh cuz it took around 15 minutes to make and was right around 11:30 so they should I've been a fresh pie what a disappointment cheese tastes like plastic the sauce was Sour kind of taste like Costco sauce but not as good go okay at best but never again pretty hard to mess up a cheese slice especially fresh out of you use the girl at the counter was super friendly very good service but I would stay away from the pizza maybe their dinners or other things are better I don't know"}
{"text":"Been waiting here for over an hour and still no pizza. Just me and one other person. Just getting ready to walk out no clue what is going on."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for dinner and we ordered a pizza and salad.  The young woman who waited on us was very nice and professional, prices are reasonable and the eating area was bright and clean but in my opinion, the pizza was very disappointing. We were the only customers in Leo's during our entire meal.  No other customers came in to order or to pick up an order.  We shared a large Chef salad. The salad was generous but typical for those pizza places that sell by the slice: iceberg lettuce, sliced white onion, shredded ham, black olives, shredded mozzarella cheese and the obligatory 4-5 pieces of sliced pepperoni. We did enjoy the salad as the lettuce was fresh and crisp and they were generous with the toppings.  The pizza we ordered was the Meatzza, but it looked and tasted like a frozen pizza.  I am convinced that the pizza crust is purchased by the restaurant as a frozen, pre-formed crust, because the pizza crust edge was hard and the bottom of the crust was chewy. It was light on the sauce, the pieces of meat were too small to identify and there wasn't just grease on the pizza pan, there was water - like the water that is left from cooking frozen meats and vegetables.The water accumulated in the middle of the pizza pan resulting in the bottom of the pizza crust being wet. Unfortunately, I didn't think the flavor was very good either.  So far my vote for the best pizza in the area would be Garden Pizza in Goodyear."}
{"text":"Best I've had in AZ reminds me of back home! Ive never had a bad pie or anything else from here. Always on time and piping hot!"}
{"text":"We have been looking for months for a good, close pizzeria.  We stopped in to Leo's yesterday and we found what we were looking for... excellent pizza that can be ordered and eaten there.  We ordered the Hawaiian and the bacon cheese fries.  We did not have to wait very long for what I can only describe as one of the best pizzas I have ever eaten.  The crust was perfect and tasty, the sauce was the best combination of Italian seasonings, the cheese was excellent, and the toppings of ham, bacon and pineapple were outstanding.  Some places skimp on toppings, cheese, and/or sauce... not Leo's.  Ample amounts of each without overdoing any of them.  The fries were good and came with your choices of Ranch, Blue Cheese, and/or ketchup.  The service was excellent and the counter gal kept checking on us without being intrusive.  She was very pleasant and accommodating.  If you are looking for ambiance, this is not your place.  If you are looking for a clean, neighborhood pizzeria with a friendly staff, this is it.  We cannot wait to go back and try one of Leo's other pizzas.  We really enjoy a good NY style pizza and Leo's has hit it out of the park!"}
{"text":"Tried two different pizzas pepperoni and supreme from here I can't lie it was ok pizza but just good not great. Won't be going back again."}
{"text":"Very good food and I love that it is family/locally owned! The wings are really good, they are not your typically buffalo wings, they have a more vinegar taste them and are delicious! I recommend Leo's Pizza!"}
{"text":"I Love trying new pizza places! Fact is, this place has been opened since 4th qtr. of 2015, I think. Nevertheless, it is new to me because I have not tried it. I pulled the trigger tonight and decided to give it a go. Reading the reviews here on yelp, it is either all in 5 stars or all out 1 star, very little middle ground. You love it or hate it. But, I am the one of those caught near the middle here, and here is my short story. It was a balmy Thursday night... JK. I ordered for delivery at 5:05pm on a Thursday night 08/10/2017 and all my items arrived at 5:43pm, not bad for a five o'clock order. I ordered an XL plain cheese, XL Spicy Chicken, small Hot Hawaiian Splash without the hot sauce and a Philly Steak sub. First off, the pizza dough seems very generic on all the pizzas I ordered. There doesn't seem to be any \"love\" in the process of making the dough. It was bland on all three pizzas and got a 1-star rating on all pizzas. Here we go with the reviews of the items. The cheese pizza was okay, I thought there was way too much oregano and several other spices fighting each other in the sauce. It is unique, but not for me. I gave it a 3 and my kids 10 and under gave it a high 4. Kids win this one. The Spicy Chicken was no spicy chicken. If you think this is \"like\" a hot wing pizza \"fugetaboutit\"! There was no hot wing sauce taste, much less \"hot sauce\" at all on this. Chicken, onions, bell peppers, cheese and pizza sauce. That's it! It was only saved by me, because I did have a bottle of hot wing sauce in the fridge. This Spicy chicken pizza gets a no hot sauce 1-star rating. Next the Hot Hawaiian Splash. I ordered this one without the hot sauce because my Mom was visiting and she loves Hawaiian pizza. I took a bite and I was surprised. Very good flavor on this one. I would have to give it 4 stars. Last is the Philly Steak Sub that my wife wanted. I must give this one, two ratings, the first is for flavor. 4 stars for good flavor and 1 star for presentation and handling. See the pics. The bottom was so soggy that once she tried to pick it up, it started tearing apart. I had to plate it and slice it into quarters just so she could eat it. Overall for Leo's Pizza in Surprise AZ, I must give this place a 2-star rating based on food not the speed of delivery. I hope this helps. Cost for all items with delivery and tax was $51.00. Tip was given"}
{"text":"This place has been open for a few weeks, and it is one of the best pizzas in Surprise, it destroys the only other competition (Brothers Pizza) the customer service is excellent and the pizza!"}
{"text":"I tried this pizza place for the first time and I won't be going back. The service was very friendly but the pizza is not for me nor are the wings."}
{"text":"Disgusting. Pizza tastes wet, and a long time to wait. Don't go here. Every time I go here I \"save\" my pizza for home."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and wings! And excellent service! Very clean! Defiantly need to stop in and try this out!"}
{"text":"I can't them to answer the darn phone. I called several times with no answer. It just rang. So I decided to drive down there.  They open at 10, but it was 1025 and the front door was locked. I looked inside and there was an employee behind the counter. I called again. I could hear the phone inside the business ringing. Nothing. Still wouldn't answer. So...I don't get it. I just ended up leaving."}
{"text":"Pizza was pretty good-hot and fresh! The sauce was a little bland but it was definitely better than most in the area!  Service was friendly and polite. The restaurant is very bare-bones in decor but if you don't care about ambiance, this place is definitely a keeper. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I usually check reviews before eating out, this time I was in the area and decide to stop by.  I ordered before looking at the yelp reviews, so I was a little skeptical waiting in the lobby. The Waiting area has chairs and tables nice big size Tv's , fountain drinks they also serve beer.  I had ordered the veggie pizza with tomatoes, onions, bell peppers, olives and mushrooms with a 5 piece side of medium buffalo wings. I must say after eating the food it tasted well , clean and fresh and seasoning gave it great flavor. I didn't  feel bloated i felt a bit better then usual when eating pizza's, however I only order 1 slice so there is that credibility for you to judge there lol. But I was pretty pleased with the pizza and the awesome part about it is , they allow you to order by the slice unlike other places where u have to buy the whole pizza, One slice of pizza and 5 wings my total  comes out to $7.86. Which is not bad I usually spend about $15-35 when i order. More money for me :)! In conclusion I was satisfied with the pizza. And the wings were pretty crispy.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"we LOVE this place!!! Great pizza at very reasonable prices. Wings are really good too."}
{"text":"Surprise has a great new neighborhood pizza place. Been waiting awhile for Leo's to open and now I'm very glad they did. Had wings and a sandwitch tonight and both were great.  The hot is just right not killing you with spice but brings some heat. Had the Italian sandwitch and should have brought half of it home but I ate the whole thing. The meats were just right and the mozzarella is shredded on site and is perfect. The bread is chewy while not destroying the roof of your mouth. Beer is served in a great frosty glass mug and tops off the meal perfectly. The dining room seats about 50 and has large tv's in view of every table. The menu is the right size for a neighborhood pizza place but the staff also seemed willing to go off menu and make other dishes. The salads do not feature a caprese salad but based on the fresh mozzarella they use on their pies and the fresh basil they use it wouldn't be a stretch to order. So nice to have a restaurant in walking distance so I can have a ice cold beer with my dinner and walk on home. Will definitely be back  and will also tell people to give it a try."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. We are kind of tired of our normal pizza places around here. They were very friendly on the phone. I ordered a large white pizza and a large cheese pizza. It was done when they said it would be. We just weren't happy with the taste. The crust wasn't very flavorful and had a strange texture. Also the pizzas seemed very greasy. The sauce wasn't very flavorful. We just didn't like it. In fact we ended up throwing away about half of a pizza because no one wanted the left overs. Also I think their large is smaller than what we normally get somewhere else. I'm so sorry to write this because I want to encourage small business! They were nice. I have to be honest though, we weren't impressed."}
{"text":"OK, this place is new. So we must give them time. Always want local businesses to succeed. We have been waiting for a while for Leo's Pizza to open up. Finally they are. We ordered the cheesy bread, and large pepperoni and jalapeno pizza with extra thin crust. Cheesy bread was great, comes out extra hot. Cheese is like it's name. Very cheesy and taste great. The marinara sauce is also very good. Pizza was OK, came out very hot. Smells great, truth be told, taste is not bad. However, bottom of crust is very crispy. But it gets soft on top of the crust. My guess they need to cook it slower and hotter. The ingredients were great. Sauce, cheese, pepperoni are good. Jalapeno was awesome, pickled perfect, and very spicy.  Place really doesn't have a decor. Seats 48 people, but has four big screens. Has your basic tables and chairs.  They do have about four beers on draft. A nice menu selection, and desert.  Would we try this place again? Of course. I am hoping, it gets better as time goes on."}
{"text":"Pretty damn good for the price. $1.75 for a slice. Will be returning to cheat on my diet lol."}
{"text":"Horrible tasting, if you want to know what cardboard taste like check this place out."}
{"text":"Perfect pocket restaurant. VERY clean, outstanding low prices. Pizza by the slice for lunch. Less than $3 for a slice and a drink! Chef salad for $5 and it was loaded! Lunch for 2 under 10 bucks? Crazy. We also had our meal in 5 minutes which is a must if you are on you lunch hour. Great experience and very friendly owners. Give these guys your business"}
{"text":"Just ate here food was ok...pizza was soggy due to crust being so thin....make crust slightly thicker....maybe add chicken nuggets on menu for kids....great staff...very outgoing and friendly...will come back in a few month to try again...."}
{"text":"Pizza is delicious!! Cheese is top notch and pizza crispy! They also have good beers and prices are very competitive.  Icing on the cake is Leo though...super nice guy and always accommodating! Definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza! Good whether you eat there or get it to go. My new favorite pizza place. Always clean and never crowded. The hidden gem of pizza places for Surprise."}
{"text":"The pizza was good, price was reasonable, and the staff friendly.   We ordered take out and it was a good, fresh pizza. Yum.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Food is alright. Their Stromboli's are Calzones. We tried this place 3 times and the Air conditioner was NOT on. First time we were told the AC was broken. Second and third time??? Just didn't turn it on. I'd rather dine in elsewhere."}
{"text":"Tried this pizza for the first time I always see it on my way to work and I've been wanting to have it for awhile. The service was great the girl at the counter was very nice. The pizza sauce tastes like spaghetti O's sauce. Don't get me wrong I like spaghetti O's but not as pizza sauce."}
{"text":"Great customer service and very fast delivery with decent prices.  I thought the pizza was great and for the price, even better!"}
{"text":"As I was on my way home from work, I decided to check out Leo's since it was a place my husband and I hadn't tried yet. I was not impressed at all. For starters, I was not expecting a pizzeria to look the way this place did. The walls could use some pictures or something to make the place more welcoming and not awkward. They had what looked like a bar shelf with plastic,cheap vodka bottles on it. Curious if they were serving liquor as well, I asked the young girl working the register and she said \"nope they're there because the owners are still figuring out what they want to do.\" Immediately I thought to myself well I sure hope they will offer a better selection for vodka! Anyway so I finally get home  and try their pizza...and I was not pleased! The pizza had no flavor and was super salty. The sauce wasn't tasteful and the cheese was not good quality as it was evident not only in the flavor of it but also the texture. The crust was hard and had what looked like corn dust on it which was very strange. I ended up throwing away the left overs! I hate to leave this review because I'm a supporter of small businesses but I really wish the owners would spend a little money on buying quality ingredients!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and Service! Our favorite Pizza and Wing spot in Surprise! The Dinner special prices are very reasonable. I highly suggest everyone to try this great pizza spot!"}
{"text":"Usually I try to make my posts unique and detailed so people trying know what to  expect, but all I can say is my family was highly disappointed. Pizza was soggy, tasted bland and was cold by the time it arrived. Nothing about it stood out from any other place. We wont be back."}
{"text":"Service was great,  beer is good,  pizza is delicious... very flavorful.  We had the cheese pizza and the white pizza... both were very good."}
{"text":"We went there because my little guy's name is Leo so we thought we should give it a try! The pepperoni pizza was delicious and they had local craft beers on draft. We did meet Leo the owner who was very friendly and made us feel welcome. The cashier Samantha was adorable and very nice. They both acknowledged my son beyond expectations (which is huge for a mommy) and even surprised him with a yummy cannoli at the end. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Tried Leo's  for their first time. We ordered a pizza and a salad. Very pleasantly surprised. Loved the pizza and the salad was great.  They decor was very basic, but the food was excellent."}
{"text":"Don't know really if the food is good here. Could not get anyone to answer the phone so I could order a pizza.  Tried twice. Their loss. No sale."}
{"text":"We tried their Philly steak sandwiches and fries for our first trip in.  The sandwiches were delicious with a generous portion on a perfect roll. The fries were hot, crispy, seasoned and served with cold ketchup. We'll be returning to try their pizza soon."}
{"text":"We liked it, the interior could be spruced up a bit. It had a to go pizza place vibe. We loved the wings and the pizza was good too. We will be back! ;)"}
{"text":"Had pizza & wings. Pizza was pretty good, not a great crust. Wings were good. Side of meatball was disappointing. Sauce was tasty however the meatball was tasteless. Way too soft devoid of flavor. The place smelled of air freshener, off putting."}
{"text":"First visit was a very good experience as the pizza well done and a great sauce taste. Asked 4 an Extra crunch on the crust and it came out hot and perfect, good prices as well."}
{"text":"The girl who helped us was absolutely the sweetest thing in the world. The prices are cheap. We are visiting from Florida and easily what we ordered in Florida would've been at least 15 but it was just 7 dollars. We were amazed. It's clean and delicious."}
{"text":"I love this place. Great pizza. Great clean atmosphere. The owner Leo it's a really nice guy. I try to come here two or three times a week. It's a N.Y. Style pizza. Best pizza in the area and prices are cheap very affordable."}
{"text":"Visiting my friends house helping put together stuff and he ordered pizza from this place. He wanted me to share my thoughts of the food and share some pics. Not a fan of the food. I was here when it was delivered and it did smell pretty good. From there, mostly downhill. See pics and Rick M. review of this place. He said it all. I'm just supplying the pics."}
{"text":"We love trying new pizza places so we decided to try Leo's on Tuesday. The price was perfect, the inside looked clean and setup nice with menus on each table. The employee was friendly. However the most important part, the pizza, was gross. The sauce was very bitter. Had no good flavor. I wanted to like this place but it's just not my cup of tea!"}
{"text":"Beer was good...everything else could use some serious work.  The pizza was bland, the service was less than average, and the ambiance...um...yeah, no ambiance.  Will definitely not be returning."}
