{"text":"With so many local bars and restaurants in the area, you would be best to skip this one. Waitstaff is mediocre at best, disorganized and lacking knowledge of menu.  Long wait time for drinks and food. Cleanliess of the staff concerns me.  I am thinking they are only open seasonally with the Golf Course, SO I am very leary eating in establishments that are seasonal due to the fresh food factor. They do not seem very busy, so not sure how quickly their food is rotated through. Very overpriced, sandwiches $12??? not worth it. The \"chef's featured Specials\" are pretty much lets see how we can use all the leftovers in the freezer to create a meal, again very overpriced. http://webapps.achd.net/Restaurant/RestaurantSearch.aspx BE SURE TO VISIT THE ALLEGHENY COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT inspection pages for this and any restaurant you plan to visit."}
{"text":"In this order I would go Food, Atmosphere, Service. The Food is always the shining star at Westwood bar and grill. We went for a birthday party and had about 15-20 guests with us. It was not busy with one other table of 4 at the time. We immediately had problems with the server (which later on we found out was new) and her lack of experience. It took almost 15-20 minutes just for the drink order to be taken and served. The waitress then took everyones order, appetizers and entrees together, which I hate to do because 80% of all places seem to screw it up. Once our first round of drinks were finished we asked for another round and another 15-20 minutes went by with no success. We had to actually go to the bar to get them quicker, and there was no one at the bar, so not sure why the bartender couldn't have come over to assist? I got an appetizer and it never came. A few guests had salads that never came. The food came out in an awkwardly un rhythmic flow where half of the guests were eating and almost finished while the others were still waiting for their meals. When the food did arrive it was good as expected. I had a burger and was cooked to how I asked. Other guests all said their food was good when it had finally arrived. Long story short, if you want good food, i suggest it. The service was incredibly bad but the manager did come over to offer assistance and try to make things right which was a plus. The atmosphere was average, with a small doorway separating the dining room from bar area. If you want to go and try somewhere new, make sure to bring an extra hour of your time just to be safe."}
{"text":"Great new beer selection and they always offer a beer or cocktail special. The pizzas are excellent. Dough is on the sweet side and they have a variety if specialty selections. It is smoking in the bar area, so if that is not your thing, sit in the dining area."}
{"text":"Darn! Can it really get better? The smoked wings, the hand breaded chicken tenders, and tonight we had the burgers.  Outstanding, brought our dear friends here tonight and they were so impressed. So good. Great service. Wonderful, knowledgeable bartenders. Thank you!"}
{"text":"My food was soggy and cold by the time it got to me. Also, kind of bland as well. You would think for the price they'd try to be inventive and do something different but even though they tried it just tastes like any other mediocre restaurant bar food. I'm pretty disappointed."}
