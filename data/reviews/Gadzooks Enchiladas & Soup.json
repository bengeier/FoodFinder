{"text":"I like enchiladas.  So, naturally, I have been frequenting Gadzooks for a little over a month now and am more than happy to submit an almost perfect review of their establishment. Pros: Food is amazing.  With a very from scratch taste and feel I appreciate, along with new items that hit the chalk board and run the risk of availability, it's hard to go in and get the same old same old every time.  This is the one thing places like Chipotle can't exactly replicate and I admire; new flavors and dishes are what make this stand apart. Enchiladas are made to order with enough customization choices to keep you going back.   Pulled Buffalo enchiladas? I managed the last one and considered putting it up on EBAY.  The enchilada oven.  There is something special about watching your dish enter the oven and the cheese bubbles with happiness.   Cons:   Get there early.  Parking is at a premium though not as bad as most places on 7th st.  Here is my issue; the line.  The whole process operates like subway, chipotle, etc which isn't too bad but for the fact that your dish can come out of the oven and sit for minutes until you are able to pay, fight the single drink dispenser, and get seated.  I have on more than one occasion diverted to another restaurant if I spot a line out the door.   True, good things come to those who wait but I dislike lines for food so that is my only hangup with Gadzooks, who otherwise has some of the tastiest enchiladas made to order I have had the pleasure of sampling for some time."}
{"text":"What spicy, tasty food and a good value.  But \"warning Will Robinson\", if you are a little on the Asperger side or just have a difficult time with quick decisions, make sure you get a menu ahead of time to sort out the dozen or so decisions you need to make on each item.  It is also difficult to hear the server provide instruction across the much appreciated but very effective audio barrier, sanitary glass shield.  There weren't many folks ordering at the time I was there so I felt ok taking a lot of time sorting out my first visit,  but if there were a crowd I would have felt like a rock in the road.    Will I go back despite those issues?  Sure.  I tried a chopped salad, enchiladas and tacos with both kinds or tortillas, ribs, green chili pork and chicken.  The spicing was perfection. The food is amazing, the servers were kind and helpful and I might even go back just to watch the machine that ties up the to go boxes."}
{"text":"Love there tortilla soup its so good just wish they have you more of it. . My husband gets the enchiladas they are also very tasty. We really like this place, its our go to for good eats.  See ya guys soon."}
{"text":"Think of Chipotle ordering for enchilada and tacos...  but that is where the comparison ends.   My wife and tried this place yesterday for the first time.   We were very surprised the level of quality food, better than many higher end Mexican restaurants."}
{"text":"I can't believe how good this food is! At first I thought this was going to be just like Chipotle by the way they have it all set up, but this food is 10x better then Chiptole! They were sold out of the bison meat so I got the pork ribs instead and if the pork ribs were this good, I can't imagine how good the bison is! If you've been by this place and wondered if it's any good, it's definitely worth going!"}
{"text":"Wow. Woweeeewow. Fresh, flavorful, fast, reasonably priced. Yes!  Are you that kind of person that doesn't like just one thing on your plate - but likes to sample many things and take a bite of each thing over and over going round the plate til you're done?  ME TOO.  Gadzooks is a dream for you and I! So many inside filling choices, so many topping choices, so many salsa choices... I basically tried everything and it was all amazing, and there are lots of veg friendly options including an outstanding corn bread filling that sounds weird but is so creamy and tasty you'll go nuts. And the tortillas are awesome which is a necessity.   I pretty much want to order another round and just spend the day here. Don't judge me you'd want to, too, if you were here."}
{"text":"Excellent food, the tortilla soup is the best I have ever had, staff was friendly and prices are reasonable for the quality of food."}
{"text":"Kind enchiladas! This place is like an upscale or fresher chipotle.  You make your own enchilada, nachos, or salad. All their ingredients are fresh and feel like they spend a little extra time to find the good stuff.   The Salas and sauces are awesome.   The location is a little small so it can get tight when they are busy, but they have great carry out containers."}
{"text":"A spicy 3.5 stars!  A good value and locally owned venture in central Phoenix.  Stopped in and tackled some tacos to go.  There was a wide variety of meat and veggie options.  Sampled the Short rib and Chile-pork tacos that both had a little zip to them.  The chicken tacos are the safest bet on the spicy barometer, but still flavorful.  The homemade flour/corn tortillas are a nice touch.  I'd take the staff up on the offer to melt the cheese in the wood fire stove as our food was a little cold when we got home.    I'll definitely go back to try some different combinations of meats and homemade salsas.  (Referring To-Go order) It seems that the packaging is a little over the top and wasteful - although beautifully done.  The food is served up in a circular aluminum foil pan, typical for Mexican fare, and then slid into an orange square sleeve for marketing purposes.  We had two dishes so they were then stuffed into a Spanish Inquisition styled contraption that then binds the two packages together.  While fun to watch the first time, it does slow down the line, then is annoying to cut off when you're to your destination and ready to scarf down.  All in all, I'd rather save the trees and the 45 seconds it takes to wrap them. (Perhaps change the packaging for the tacos as they we soggy when we got home)  The interior/exterior of the building are very contemporary, which adds to the allure of wanting to sit and have a beer with your meal. It makes a great alternative to Chipotle and your dollars stay local.  A few fine tweaks and it could easily be a 5 star experience:)"}
{"text":"This place is very good. I really enjoyed the set up (like chipotle) and all the staff was very friendly and informative. Really hope a second location is opening up!!!"}
{"text":"The tacos are awesome!!  Between the 2 of us we tried the chicken, pork, potato and cornbread versions.  All of them were great, but the cornbread taco was really good!!!"}
{"text":"Like everyone else on here, I saw this place going up and had to try it.  As a mexican food fanatic I figured it would be interesting, but wasn't expecting it to be so good.  I really enjoyed everything I had.  I got 1 enchilada and 1 taco with green chile pork and the short ribs.  They were delicious and hot (tempature)!  I liked the meats that I got better here than at Chipotle or Qdoba (I heart their barbacoa).  Their \"hot sauce\" has a good spice to it, but I am always looking for hotter!  The only complaint I had was the noise echo.  The floors are concrete and just bounce all noise off them making it hard to hear and order.  Overall, I really liked this place and I would definitely come back, especially because it is so close to my job."}
{"text":"The food was beyond amazing. But, there has to be someone checking the customers out. At the times person working the cash register had to leave the register to chop up the salad. There's always room for improvement. Great place tho!!"}
{"text":"Went to Gadzooks for the first time last week. Food was great. There was a mix up at the register and I had realized  I was over charged  $10 the next day. Long story short I called that morning to speak with the manager and he was able to see where I was over charged. He asked if I could go in to get the difference and I explained I lived in another city and it would be a long drive for me. He said that was fine he would mail me the difference with a gift card. I thought that was awesome.  What really blew my mind was when I got a knock at my door and Gadzooks employee hand delivered it with a written apology from the manager. This is not service you get every day. They really went above and beyond to make the situation right. Definitely will have to make a drive out to phoenix soon  to thank them."}
{"text":"Great enchiladas, all parts come together for a delicious meal. I had the green pork, very tasty."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. Better than chipotle if you ask me. Endless flavor combinations. You get a lot of food and it's gooood. The beef and cornbread mix was my favorite. I will definitely be back! Also the employees were super helpful in guiding us through the ordering process - offering suggestions - and they were super enthusiastic about the food!!"}
{"text":"Great place, I love enchiladas and this place makes them great.  It has a Chipotle or Subway like setup of choice what you want. Service is great and timely. Also great options to, including vegetarian like spinach and mushroom or smash potato."}
{"text":"You want authentic Mexican food, Gadzooks has got it.  The bold and imaginative flavors blow my mind.  From the bison to the chicken, I can't go wrong.  I always choose the 1/2 and 1/2 tortillas to compliment my meats followed by a combination of sauces that I change every time I go.  I don't think I have had the same dish twice.  The quality is awesome and I love their friendly staff.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I tried Gadzooks because I wanted soup. The only soup they offer is Chicken Tortilla Soup. When I commented about this to the person behind the counter his reply was \"The sign says enchiladas and soup, singular not soups plural. What did you expect?\" To which I replied \"At least Albondigas and perhaps Menudo on the weekends or some other kind of caldo(that's soup in Spanish)\". $6.75 for two enchiladas that were not all that spectacular. Was not impressed and will not be returning."}
{"text":"We love this place. All the food has great flavor, but my personal favorite is one pork enchilada with green sauce and a short rib enchilada with red sauce with lots of pickled onions and cabbage slaw on top. We have two young children and it is their favorite place. They get to watch their food being prepared, don't have to wait for the food, and all of the staff are super friendly and helpful. We like it enough that we have brought out of town guests too."}
{"text":"Day 2 of their soft open and the food was still fantastic. The entire staff was super nice and a pleasure to interact with.   I ordered the Green Chile Pork and Short Rib Enchilada. Super good. House made corn tortillas were legit. Make sure to order it Christmas style for red and green.  The lava sauce is super spicy and flavorful.  Overall an awesome new spot in Downtown PHX!"}
{"text":"What happened to this place? It use to be value for your dollar. They have cut down on food served but the prices stayed the same. The food quality seems to be slipping also. Such a shame since it use to be our go to place for enchiladas."}
{"text":"Trendy, yet good food. The soups are amazing! As for the line, well...good food but nothing to rave over. The one thing that killed it for me was them being skimpy on the sauces. Enchiladas should drown in flavorful sauces but this place is very tight on their pour. Their so wonderful soups are not advertised on the chalkboard (don't understand that since their tag line is: Enchiladas & Soup.) Overall, not a bad place, but wouldn't recommend it or take my out-town-friends there."}
{"text":"was not sure what to expect...but, it was fantastic. Some great choices and fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"Excellent enchiladas!  The place is a bit noisy but the food is good. A unique concept."}
{"text":"This place has a Chipotle type ordering system but the flavors and unique style of making the dish is absolutely great. I tried the two enchilada plus a lada for 2$ more. So I tried the chicken, pork and bison.. All very moist and flavorful. Topped them with cotija cheese sour cream and guacomole..I thought the prices are adequate. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is a terrific place, and I see a lot of folks agree. I am weighing in to contradict the Chipotle comparison. This is a lot more interesting food with richer, spicier sauces than Chipotle, which is adequate in a pinch but resembles factory food, at least to me. This is a terrific LOCAL place with its own spin on Mexican food, and the folks behind the counter are always friendly and helpful. I love having you guys in the neighborhood!   Try the pickled onion . . ."}
{"text":"Cornbread enchiladas changed my life............ and this is coming from somebody who rarely strays from \"authentic mexican food\"  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Just went here for lunch! First time and they made great recommendations for my enchiladas. I had the pork with corn tortilla and braised rib meat with flour. Great taste to the savory meats. Added both types of cheese offered and loaded it with all the fixens! Think of the ordering process like Chipotle but way better food and taste. Small dining area. Arrived for lunch around 1pm. Ideal as the downtown lunch crowd was pretty much done. No wait to order and eat! Atmosphere is simple with kinda of industrial contempory. Cannot wait to check this place out again."}
{"text":"I went the other day for lunch and the place is pretty good (really 4.5 stars). I got the cornbread enchiladas, a unique concept in and of itself, with the red sauce. The red sauce had a very mellow heat that didn't overpower the flavor and meshed well with the slightly sweet cornbread.   I will definitely be back to try some of the other menu items and support a local business that is churning out excellent food at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Yummy, what else can I say ????ok I'll say it again Yummmmmmmmmmmmmmmy   Enchiladas   Eggs   Dessert,  yes please !!"}
{"text":"The food is good and service is great. Get there early for lunch because it fills quickly."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is like nothing I have experienced before. So many choices... They only have a few menu items but you can personalize them however you like them. Kind of like an upscale version of that chain of sub shops.  It was pretty intimidating at first, you could tell the regulars from the newbies like me. I stepped back and listened to a few other people order before I jumped in.  They specialize in enchiladas that they make in a little cast iron skillet so when it comes out of the oven it is hot and melty. It was really great food and I definitely felt like I needed to come back and eat there again. My wife ordered soup and it was really good too.  In Midtown Phoenix, there are a ton of choices to eat and it's nice to find someplace that's different from all the rest."}
{"text":"An enchilada eatery that thrives doign things the right way. With fresh ingredients, fast preparation, and delicious results. By giving the people the choicest choices of ingredients and letting them decide how to dress it up, it gets a lot of comparisons to Chipotle, and while Chipotle deserves all due respect, Gadzooks has truly raised the bar for Phoenix-based Mexican food. The green chile pork and tomatillo chicken are delicious, the braised short rib is savory, the jack potatoes are unreal. Add the hand mixed guacamole for extra creaminess, the slaw for some crunch, or get the fried egg on top for an authenic (and filling) flavor experience. Go early to avoid the longer lines, just don't get it to-go, it's best when eaten fresh out of the oven. My only regret after each trip is not having enough room in the stomach to eat three more orders."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch. In my opinion and my opinion only, nothing special. Chicken and beef enchiladas covered with different sauces. Not very tasty. But, again, this is my opinion. I am not the best judge of Mexican food. The place was reasonably busy. Obviously, not everyone shares my opinion. And that is not a bad thing."}
{"text":"I found the food excellent,  and I'll definitely return. The downside is that it's quite busy, and that usually keeps me from visiting more often despite living nearby.  Definitely recommended if the parking lot isn't full."}
{"text":"Yummy! Just make sure if you do take out the person cooking it knows how long to keep your food in the oven. Been here several times but this time a girl cooked mine and when I got home the bottom was sticking to the container. It was burned"}
{"text":"The food is ok but nothing special!, for rhe price, dont think it hits the mark,.with all those toppings, i think the true flavor is taken away, i thought the flavor was missing, bland even with toppings!"}
{"text":"Food here is delicious, reasonable priced, and we just saw them feed a homeless person on the house!   Very thoughtful especially since it's Valentine's Day!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here and the food was delicious! Everyone found something to suit them. Overall, the food was great, the restaurant is clean, and they were very helpful!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Have been wanting to go here since it opened. Cool design, lots of room, and awesome food. Very busy but worth the wait. I want to try everything on their menu.   Go nuts and get all the toppings...its worth it.   Finally the modern enchilada has arrived!!!"}
{"text":"I love spicy food food but this was over the top!  They should have mentioned how spicy the dish was... I could barely eat it. I ordered tacos and received enchiladas.  I'll never go back."}
{"text":"The concept of the restaurant REALLY caught my eye when I first saw it being built.  I thought it was a great concept and was looking forward to trying this place. Unfortunately, it has the vibe of Chipotle. Don't get me wrong...I love Chipotle (which is much better & reasonably priced than this place).   I suppose I had a different expectation of Gadzooks concept \"enchiladas & soups.\"  The staff was friendly, but their food was below mediocre. The portions are extremely small (3\" tortillas and 1 ounce of meat--if you're lucky), the enchiladas really aren't enchiladas (I can attest to this as I am Hispanic) and there was nothing special tasting about the meat. Also, the price point for what you get is a little high.  I had 2 tacos and one enchilada (no sides are offered), chips & guac and it was $13!  Unfortunately, the meal wasn't very filling (and I'm a small girl).  I have no problem spending $13 on lunch, but it better be a larger portion than what fits on a 6\" plate.  The tortillas were really good, in which they offer a 50/50 (corn/flour) tortilla option and the guac was decent.   To their credit, they had only been open two days and had someone walking around asking the customers for feedback on the food, pricing, portions, etc.  Hopefully they'll head our advice and will evolve into their concept of \"enchiladas & soups,\" as I had high hopes for this place."}
{"text":"GADZOOKS IS AWESOME!!!!! Do you like Chiptole?  You will LOVE this place.  Take everything you like about Chiptole and multiply it by 10.  You're going to get better food, better service, etc.  Everything tastes fresh - it does not taste like you're eating precooked, reheated restaurant food.  I can't wait until I'm back in PHX to eat here again."}
{"text":"Am I the only person who thinks a restaurant that has SOUP in the name of the place, should offer more than 2 choices??? I was very disappointed not to have more soups to choose from. That said, an enchilada with the option of a Poblana pepper in place of a tortilla was an unexpected delight! It was getting busy when I was there and I felt rushed, but I will go back another time and try something different."}
{"text":"The food is very good. My favorite thing in the salad. It is always super fresh and the options are great for what you want in your salad whether you want all vegetables or not. I have also had the pork and the chicken tacos and I would totally recommend them as well.   The only drawback is the setting. There isn't a lot available and it is kind of cramped. Also, the chairs look great but are really uncomfortable. If you happen to have a backpack or purse you are going to have to eat with it in you lap because the chairs have a design that won't let you sling your things over the back without them falling on the floor.   Buuuuuuut, the food is very good so I still definitely enjoy coming here I just wish they would get better chairs."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place and I'm very impressed. The food was amazing. When they say spicy it actually is...which is rare. Lots of good options for vegetarians"}
{"text":"Absolutely love the food here!  Some of the options sound a little weird at first, but everything tastes great!  I have been back many, many times to try out different combinations of enchiladas.  My personal favorite is combo of a spinach/mushroom enchilada and a cornbread enchilada.   It is very crowded at lunchtime, but the service is quick.  If you order take-out, you'll be on your way in just a few minutes.  For eating in, I recommend stopping by in the early evening."}
{"text":"Eating lunch here now, this place is so phenomenal that I had to stop and write about it. The employees here are magnificent. The food is incredible!  Our first time, and now our new favorite.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I'm glad it's a but of a drive from my house or else i would be a fat, fat man. It's the upscale Chipotle of enchiladas. The service is quick, and their sauces are delicious, although they could be a little spicier in my opinion. The corn filling is to die for, I could eat it all day, and their green chile pork is great too. Any time I'm in the area i try to swing by. Still need to try it with an egg on top."}
{"text":"Customer service is always so friendly and helpful, especially with all the different options and explaining they have to do.  I always go for the mixed tortilla, and 50/50 meat and corn inside.  This place is the bomb, I recommend getting an over easy egg on top, uhhh so good. Trust me."}
{"text":"Love the food here. Biggest complaint is the disjointed ordering process and confusion about what is included, what isn't. Some simple edits to the chalkboard would clear that up. And the deafening noise level of the place doesn't help. Horrible acoustics combined with blaring overhead music is so chaotic  Even the staffer said she goes home and her head is spinning from the noise. And probably because customers--and staff-- have to ask \"Wha?\" 10 tines during the ordering process."}
{"text":"Just had dinner there and I can say, without a doubt, this place is great.  The menu is simple, the food is fresh and delicious.  I never thought of enchiladas as a great choice, but Gadzooks has changed my mind.    I really liked that there seemed to an eclectic group of people there.  Heavily tattooed ladies sitting at tables next to old guys in Hawaiian shirts, next to a couple of families with young children.    My wife, daughter and I chose Gadzooks for a late dinner after visiting the Zombie Apocalypse seminar at the Arizona Science Museum.  I loved the fact that the owners converted an old Gas Station into a great little restaurant.    The place was clean, nicely set up and staff were friendly, welcoming and very helpful in guiding us through the menu.  My wife and I split a two plus one enchilada deal and the portions were plentiful and delicious.    A special note, the guacamole was very fresh and flavorful.   Well worth the extra buck!  Next time I'm going to give the soup a try.  If it as good as everything else, I'm sure I won't be disappointed.   They only thing I would think that would make the dinning experience better would be more desert choices.  The pumpkin bread cookies were good, but a little bland compared to the rest of the meal.  To be honest, I would liked to have seen fried ice cream or at least a gourmet brownie offering, but that's just me.    Bottom line.......Five big ole gold stars.  Give Gadzooks a try, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"The enchiladas are simply delicious, served in a ceramic bowl that goes in the oven as the enchiladas are made to order. Really unique concept and great value: this is fast Tex-Mex counter service that tastes upscale without breaking the bank. The assembly line concept from Chipotle but done absolutely right. The atmosphere is about the same as Chipotle's but you won't care. They must know the menu is a neck-breaker, and like me, anyone going for the first time won't know how to order. If recommend getting the menu on a postcard before you get in line to order."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place for lunch so we stopped by. It almost feels like a chipotle with the ordering set up but omg was it good. I had the beef short rib tacos and they were so good!! They also make their own tortillas which is awesome. I will definitely be returning next time I'm in Phoenix!!"}
{"text":"I just went today for the first time.  Really cool concept and the options you can add to your enchilada and tacos are a bit more interesting than Chipotle (not knocking Chipotle).    I will say that as a first timer, it's quite a confusing way to order as the signage is directly above you so you have to step out of line near the tables to see the boards.  The decor is pretty hip.  Had to sit outside b/c  there really aren't too many tables inside, so that made the experience a bit sour b/c it's so dang humid and hot today.  Overall a cool spot and I hope to be back."}
{"text":"I have no problem with choices, I happen to like them. Yes, there are a lot of items to choose from but the staff is happy to have you taste sauces and such to make sure you get what you like. I found the staff friendly and very accommodating and willing to explain how everything is prepared and how everything works.  I especially liked the beef short rib filling. It was delicious and melts in  your mouth. I thought the chips were a bit greasy and weren't really needed with the filling enchiladas so I will probably skip that next time. I also think I added too much to my enchiladas and so I couldn't taste everything distinctly. But that's my problem.  My one problem is that the place is called Enchiladas and Soup. I was really hoping to try both. Why not offer a one enchilada/cup of soup combo?"}
{"text":"This is a pleasant addition to the area.  The food is fantastic. Flavors of authentic mexican preparations; Roasted chile', fresh tortillas... A friendly fella preparing meals recommended I try the bison. He even went as far as offering a sample, which i politely declined and went straight for the bison as my enchilada choice. His sincerity while offering the meat option made me feel  that he was stoked to have it and proud to serve it. Strong choice!! They were phenomenal. I'll be heading back again, without a doubt. I didn't take note of a bike rack, however, it's certainly a place to consider for some tasty neighborhood eats. Thanks for all of your hard work and preparation Gadzooks, you're serving up great meals. I'll be spreading the word."}
{"text":"Uugh.  I too hate giving local businesses bad reviews, but the food there was simply terrible.  I ordered tacos and they served them up enchilada style.  I mean it was actually funny that all they had to do is give me tacos and instead they plunked massive amounts of cheese over these tacos and served them up enchilada style!  So I tried to eat them, and truthfully even if they just served me the tacos the food tasted terrible and it was overpriced to boot.  Finally, I know this is terrible to say, but the server girl in line had so many piercings on her face and in her nose it was kind of disgusting.  I get that people want to express themselves with piercings, but when I'm buying food from you, I don't want to see metal drooping out of your nose.  Just saying..."}
{"text":"So damn good. Best enchilada i've had in a while. Oh the staff is SOOOO friendly and accommodating. The product is great, like who else has Bison enchiladas?"}
{"text":"A Chipotle style place known for their tacos and enchiladas (but IMHO, they taste WAY better than Chipotle). Gadzook's uses a fire furnace to bake their dishes. Please do yourself a favor and try the nachos and their sweet & spicy cornbread. People also love their modelo braised bison, which they only serve at lunch and until they run out. Beware, often times the employees are snarky and confused. This happens because the food belonging to the people in front of you could take longer to bake or the food belonging to the people behind you bakes faster than yours. Or vice versa. It appears it's hard for the employees to hear the customers behind the glass separating the two parties, so maybe pick up some sign language skills  or learn the universal signs for tacos and enchiladas. But it's worth the confusion/frustration because this place is GOOD! You gotta try their icing glazed pumpkin cookies (gotta buy them in a pair which makes it perfect for sharing with your someone special or friends). This place is also fairly priced as you get a lot for your money."}
{"text":"Yeah, this eatery is as good as it gets when it comes to the flavors of authentic Mexican food.  If you haven't tried it yet quit procrastinating.  Friendly people working here too."}
{"text":"Was pretty good  Would not order the pork again the Chicken was delicious"}
{"text":"These guys made the best enchilada ive ever had! I didnt know what I wanted so I just asked a dude there to make iy for me and it totally rocked. Later on in the day I burped and retasted it and I was like \"man that was a good enchilada! Im going to download yelp so I can publically display my opinion on the place\" so then I downloaded yelp and wrote this review."}
{"text":"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!!!!  I've eaten there several times - probably once a week since they opened - and yes, the line is long and maybe the way they prepare your food could be a bit more organized.  But the FLAVORS..OMG...so worth the wait.  The fresh made corn or 50/50 tortillas that are made right before your eyes - they taste so good that I crave them.  I've had the tacos and the enchiladas and my favorite are:  1) to get one pork taco and one chicken taco with a mix of cheese, pico salsa, crema, and gotta get the guac; or 2) when I'm in the 'lada mood is to get one pork and one potato (yes-potato-they're AWESOME!!) with the red sauce and a mix of cheese, the pico salsa, the crema and the guac.  Two tacos or two 'ladas may not seem like enough, but it is...I can't finish them.  You can also add one more for an additional charge if you're really hungry.  The staff is great - they have a fanstatic attitude and give you service with a smile.  Even though sometimes it is frustrating to stand and wait when the line is out the door, you get a positive vibe.  The place is fresh and clean -could probably use more parking, but we ARE in downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"I have never heard of Gadzooks until a friend suggested it to me.  I had no idea what to expect especially since the name does not imply anything.   Some people have compared this to Chipotle and I have to say that they're right in that you stand in line to order components that eventually create a taco or enchilada, and the ambiance is about the same.  But that's where the comparison stops.  The food was spectacular and the staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"I love love love Gadzooks! Best enchiladas in Phoenix! My dad is Mexican and this is better than his authentic enchiladas. The meat is perfect! The tortillas are perfect! The toppings are all fresh and yummy but the best part and the most important to me is the meat. Gadzooks does not disappoint me. Visit after visit I'm always satisfied. I've tried everything on the menu all delicious. The food is amazing. The ambience is okay. It gets very loud in there and I had to yell over the glass so they could hear my order. I know the glass is to protect the food from contaminants but it's so thick and high."}
{"text":"First off ya gotta love the name. But as for the food? Tasty....My wife and I were in for lunch and started with the same thing, half & half tortillas, one filled with short rib and the other green chile pork shoulder. Then we split, red sauce for me and green for her. Asadero (jack) cheese for her and chihuahua (cheddar for me. They then take the shallow serving croaks and put them in pizza type oven. Makes the cheese melt and really makes it service hot. Next the topping, pico de gallo and/or other salsa's. Maybe a little slaw and creme and for the salad some dressing choices. My wife tried a little vinaigrette on her enchilada and likes it. Like the menu says the green sauce is the yin to the red sauces yang. Red,smokey chile flavor, green smoother....green flavor. Chips (really good) and salsa on the side and we had a great meal.  I can see were folks would be concerned about the noise but it's the norm in places like this, hell I've been to high end restaurants that were noisier. Difference is there some of what I'm paying for is the ambience. Pricing here is so affordable for the quality of the food that the noise is part of it.   My only complaint is one I have read already. The menu placement sucks. First off it's a narrow space between the front door and the board and then it's so high up. This was our first time there and so with the extensive options and the overly helpful staff it was a little unnerving. Would have been nice to have it either in a little flyer type menu or on the wall at eye level. You try to order then have to keep stepping back to check the overhead menu board. Doesn't work for me.  All that aside we will return. Nice change of pace, hot and delicious and as stated before affordable.  Oh and please put your open days/hours on the website."}
{"text":"The food is great, but the service is slow. Be prepared to wait to get through the line if going at lunchtime. The cornbread and the short rib is full of flavor and perfect amount of spice. Getting a mix of the green and red sauce is a perfect way to top your enchilada. The cookies are delicious, but my last three visits they have been out."}
{"text":"Although it's not exactly traditional Mexican, Gadzooks is easily in my top three favorite Mexican restaurants in the valley.   The sauces and salsas have incredible flavor, the tortillas are tender and delicious and the taco and enchilada fillings are creative and crave worthy.  Jared is super customer oriented and I feel welcomed there."}
{"text":"When it comes to food, I am known to eat about half of whatever I order and save the rest for someone else to eat later. Not at this place; the food is delicious. It is not saturated in grease and has a unique way of preparation and presentation. The atmosphere is casual and cafeteria-style. It is like a higher end Chipotle. I keep telling friends to check it out and no one seems disappointed either."}
{"text":"I haven't heard the exclamation, \"Gadzooks!\" since watching an English drawing room comedy on TCM during Alec Guinness Week or something equally British and old timey. It's a great exclamation. Like, \"Zounds!\" or \"Sacré Bleu!\" or \"Bollocks!\" Things Americans don't say. We usually just say the \"F\" word.  So when we checked out the newly renovated and freshly opened \"Gadzooks: Enchiladas & Soup\" in a 40-year-old building that was originally a filling station, then Miriam's Designer Clothes (FYI: Miriam was not on Project Runway), we naturally said, \"Gadzooks! There's a new restaurant in town!\" When we tried it out, we said, \"The F-word! These are darn good!\"  Dang! I mean, who doesn't love a great enchilada, right? We feel a little territorial about things like enchiladas here in the Southwest, too, because we do them so well. Cincinnati may have its Skyline Chili. New Orleans has its jambalaya. Coney Island has its hot dogs. We've got amazing Mexican food here.  Oy! So when cute, scruffy, friendly owner Aaron Pool graduated from ASU he followed his dream: he opened an 'Enchiladeria,' let's call it. But Aaron's vision is unique: you can customize what's really a genuinely handmade enchilada with a variety of fillings, toppings, sauces and condiments. When Aaron had this, \"A ha!\" moment he said, \"Gadzooks!\" The rest, as they say, is history.  Gosh! Once you enter Aaron's clean, bright, airy \"enchiladeria\" you'll see the menu posted above the friendly assembly line where someone like the totes adorbs inky Eric will help you navigate your way through 'Lada Land. You'll see the fresh tortillas being pressed right before your very eyes. Choose either corn or the half 'n' half corn & flour tortilla. They're thick, fluffy; big on texture and taste. If you're not in an enchilada mood, try a street taco. You'll get two of either, and stuff 'em with something like Roasted Tomatillo Chicken, Green Chile Pork Shoulder, Guajillo Braised Short Ribs, the melt-in-your-mouth Modelo Braised Bison, or other succulent stuffings. I happen to be a fan of the Sauteed Spinach Mushroom, too. Aaron's up with the \"pollos\" preparing the succulent viands at 4 a.m. No kidding!  Boo-ya! Smother it! Pick your sauce, pardner! Red, Green or \"Christmas\" style with both. They pop these comidas into a stone oven, and you get it piping hot.  Zoinks! You've also got time to add salsa-- and they've got four to choose from. Mix 'n' match! Top it with scratch-made crema (a smooth, Mexican sour cream), cotija cheese, a crunchy, crisp cole slaw (we think it's fierce) and for a dollar more add sharp & creamy goat cheese, a griddle-fried egg or hand-smashed guacamole that's already rumored to be gaining a tasty reputation. Through the miracle of math, they've determined that there are 2,638,594 different combinations available. You won't get bored, believe me. You can even get a box of six enchiladas or tacos for $15 each to perk up your party. Talk about a bargain!  ¡Ay karamba! Now you've got yourself a pair of fine enchiladas or tacos, señors y señoritas! A pair is right around the $6.75 mark and you can add a third for only $2 more.  Hey! Prefer something lighter\"? Opt for a customizable, freshly chopped salad for $6.75. Feeling carnivorous? Add some meat for about two bits or so.  Dang! Soup is given short-shrift here with only one to choose from. (We hoped the \"soup\" might be plural. It isn't.) It's a dilly, however. It's Linda's (that's Aaron's frequently on-site mom) who offers up a delicious housemade Tortilla Soup for $3.95. We can't help but wish it came in a bowl, however, instead of a paper \"to-go\"- style cup.  ¡Olé! If you really want a fiesta, try their 7th Street Sangria, Osborn Oro Margarita for $4 each, or a cool cerveza. That means, \"beer.\" Currently \"piped in,\" we're hoping they'll start brewing their ice tea, soon. Hint, hint.  Gadzooks! And that, amigos, is what they call, \"the whole enchilada.\" You might even say the \"F\" word after you try 'em."}
{"text":"Gazooks, Gazooks, Gazooks - I wanted to like you, I really did. Enchiladas and soup - interesting concept though mysteriously, I found only one soup on the menu upon arrival. Yes sir, I was greeted by a single lonely Tortilla soup but yet the \"soup\" part somehow snug into the restaurant's naming convention. And while on the topic of corn, please know that asking your staff if the corn was organic was akin to asking \"what is the meaning of life?\" It required pondering so deep that I was unlikely to get an answer in this lifetime. So I resigned myself to my GMO corn maza and headed past some dried out looking fillings (was that mashed potatoes I saw??) for the toppings...still hopeful.  What an  impressive array indeed.  There is not much I don't like about Pico de Gallo, except maybe for someone fishing for the spoon in its deepest depths. Glove or no glove, I'm not a fan of anything that requires being buried wrist deep. Call it a personal preference. I finally sat down in the noisy room amongst my fellow starved and desperate cubicle dwellers. Upon first bite,  I suddenly understood the importance of the topping selection. You see, without the addition of every creamy substance known to man, your enchiladas are regretfully forgettable. The overall concept strikes me as an interesting cross of Chipotle and Subway - just minus flavorful food, but with the general poor training of Subway staff. So Gazooks, we are not a match. It's me, not you. (Disclaimer: The aforementioned phrase is designed to maintain your self-esteem while really expressing that  it is, in fact, you.)"}
{"text":"I have already eaten there four times ! The food is great. The potatoes enchilada are amazing and I an obsessed with the pickled onions. chips and guac are great! Everything is freshly made every day and tortilla dough is delivered every day. I don't mind paying a couple bucks more for fresh local food with no preservative flavoring !"}
{"text":"Food was tasty. Kinda hard to figure out all the choices your first crime. Menu was confusing.  Will definitely be back and work my way thru the menu."}
{"text":"My friend was raving about this place so we went over there together with our kids one evening.  They took her order right away, and then it was at least five minutes before they took our order.  There were five to six people behind the counter, but not much appeared to be happening.  There were two people standing directly opposite behind the counter, but they did not even say\" hello\", \"welcome ot Gadzooks\", or \"be right with you\".    Now, lets' talk about the menu.  Extremely confusing.  It's very unclear how to order a meal.  Additionally, there is no kids menu.  I asked if they could make my daughter a cheese quesadilla, which they were more than happy to do, but when I went to pay, I discovered that the quesadilla was the size of a small pancake, and they wanted 3.50 for it.  I told them for that price, they needed to add another quesadilla, which they did without question.  I think at Chipotle you can get an entire kids meal including quesadilla, rice, beans and drink, for about the same price.  So my suggestion would be to add a kids menu.    Okay, now for the food.  It was decent.  I ordered the spinach mushroom enchiladas with a goat cheese shmear.  I left feeling hungry.  A side of rice and beans would have been great.  I don't know if they offer that or not, but it doesn't come with the meal.    While my friend likes this place, and will probably go regularly, I doubt I will ever go back."}
{"text":"Fast casual spot that nails the atmosphere and showcases a variety of rich flavors. Staff excellent. I would highly recommend to others."}
{"text":"Love this place! The staff is really friendly and there are vegan/raw options. I ordered the spinach and mushroom enchiladas (no cheese) and I was impressed!  It's hard to make enchiladas taste good without cheese, but the house-made salsas and guacamole did the trick.  I'm glad to find another cool local restaurant, I will totally come back."}
{"text":"I never want to go to Chipotle again. Gadzooks is like a gourmet version of Chipotle, with comparable prices and mouth-watering salsas, meats, slaw and toppings to make your tacos/burrito/salad SO DELICIOUS."}
{"text":"MMMMMMMM I am a fan,.... The Green chili option is the way to go,.. The Bison wrapped in the Green Chili is the bee's knees!"}
{"text":"Staff was very friendly and helpful, and I liked the novelty of the restaurant's concept.  There were four vegetarian options for enchilada filling (potato, corn, cheese, and spinach), and staff was very willing to point out what the vegetarians should not order.  The finished food was delicious!"}
{"text":"Really great taste. So many options. Salad and enchiladas the best. Little wait during lunch hours but its worth it"}
{"text":"The gimmick is cute, the food is filling and decently priced. I just wish that everything didn't taste the same. I've gone to this place maybe 20 times now and no matter what combo I try, everything tastes the same. There's no real distinction of flavors. For quick enchiladas or a decent chopped salad, it's not bad, but in no way is this a place I'll pick out as a first option."}
{"text":"Awesome chicken tortilla soup and you can add your own twist to it! Will definitely be back to try their enchiladas and other menu items."}
{"text":"First off let me preface by the fact that I am extremely lazy and don't normally review places, no matter how good it is. With that being said I took the time out of my extremely unoccupied day to make this review. That is how awesome this place is!  I have been here twice now, and the first time I ordered the green chili pork and short rib enchiladas. The second time around I got both short rib. The short rib has an amazing flavor, it just pops in your mouth!  The cotija cheese and habenero lava sauce are both fantastic. This last time I even tried a side of the herbal ranch, which was, you guessed it, great! I also tried a side of their cornbread this time around and was glad I did. With actual corn and a hint of spiciness to it, it was a great addition.  To top off this great meal, they even have alcoholic beverages. Pacifico being my favorite, I got that my first time through. After which I realized he had a cream soda on tap, and boy do I love cream soda! So this time around I got the cream soda, and my wife asked if they made margaritas. Which they did, so she got one. A pink grapefruit Margarita is what they served her, and it was very delicious! A little too strong for my wife, but I didn't mind finishing off for her.  For under $30 for a family of three and one alcoholic beverage and one soda, I will gladly be coming back here on a regular basis! I highly recommend this to anyone in the area or even if you have to make a bit of a commute. Every Phoenician should try this place at least once. Unless it's on a night I choose to go, in that case, go a different night. Parking is very limited and I'd rather not park across the street... ;-)"}
{"text":"Just had Gadzooks for the first time at the AZ Taco Festival. In my opinion, they were the best tacos there. Highly recommend them - can't wait to go to their location and try other menu items!"}
{"text":"We were so stoked to give this place a try, but we were seriously disappointed. A good concept and well-braised meats were not enough to compensate for the main sauces (red and green) falling flat. The red sauce was especially awful... bitter and I found it ruined the whole dish. The green sauce needed salt and lacked real flavor. Individual components were well executed, but the sauces literally destroyed the whole meal and I couldn't finish mine, despite attempting to scrape the sauce off. I would absolutely come back if the chef modified his main recipes as this neighborhood spot is loaded with potential."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely Fantastic! the green sauce and the chicken compliment each other so well. i definitely recommend.  The service is also really good, if they know you are new they will explain everything to you, and make sure that you understand. This place is exactly like chipotle, just a little less corporate. This place is a must visit, even if it is just once!"}
{"text":"My home cooked enchiladas are better... For the price I left hungry and disappointed in the lack of flavor. If I'm not gonna cook at home I'd rather go to a hole in the wall place with better food and better prices."}
{"text":"I finally made it to the place tonight and was pleasantly surprised!!  The concept is similar to chipotle but still has its own unique experience. The staff was very helpful and knowledgable of their products and would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"First...the food is great, every time; however, tonight the staff and restaurant were shameful. Long story short, the restaurant has no screens to block the hot afternoon sun from turning the place into a heat box. Chain reaction, the AC couldn't keep the place cool, and thus the ice machines ran dry as they couldnt produce ice.   So, what did the staff (there was no manager in sight) do?  One said, \"we should probably send someone to get some ice at circle K\" when I asked if he knew that not only was their machine empty, but that the beverages served were warm (note that in the time i waited for my food, no one came with or went to get ice. None of the staff said, \"oh I'm sorry. Our machine is out of ice and not chilling the beverages in the fountain either\", as people were ordering a drink. And none of them offered an alterative, either.  Poor staff training, lack of skilled management, and a facility incapable of operating correctly on a hot summer day...hmm, I know we've had a few of these already this summer. How can this be?  Wake up owner."}
{"text":"What a great concept and place to eat! It was our first time visiting Gadzooks and didn't know what to expect. We were greeted by Jessica who was so friendly and walked us through the entire process. All of the staff there were so nice, helpful and friendly that I will be back because of their great service and good food! Even the other customers were so nice, giving us advise on what to get! We sampled many sauces and toppings! We can't wait to visit again and try new combinations!"}
{"text":"This place is so good!  It is like Chipotle but way better!  Many choices for salsas and sauces.  It was a bit overwhelming the first time.  Thank goodness for their very helpful and friendly staff.  What a fun and delicious place!"}
{"text":"Yes! So much yes in a resounding fashion!   Great food. pretty much any way you get it. Service is really cool, great recommendations. Quick if you want take out. I love this place."}
{"text":"Great variation of chipotle but with enchiladas.  A good quick lunch."}
{"text":"Great location, awesome concept and the food is excellent. It's worth the trip if you aren't in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Fabulous food.  It asked for Corn tortilla and got a freshly created one.  Choice of flavor and speed of service was great as well.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Food is great. Love the fresh homemade tortillas. And all the sauces there are amazing!  Love the potatoes they offer too.  Definitely a great place for lunch, does get pretty busy so I would recommend calling in your order if you are in a hurry. I will be coming back again soon!"}
{"text":"Finally!!! Had time to visit Gadzooks! It is wonderful!  A little intimidating at first if you don't check out their menu prior to going...ordering can be overwhelming...but worth every minute! I had pork tacos with the 50/50 tortillas!!! And a friend had the chicken tomatillo enchiladas!!! The BEST I have had in awhile! I will definitely be going back to try other combos....as an employee recommended the beef tacos! YUM!"}
{"text":"We've been wanting to try this place for a long time and we finally had the chance today. I got the green chili pork enchiladas with half red, half green sauce. The green sauce was very flavorful and slightly spicy. I didn't really care for the red sauce though. Although it didn't make my top 10 list of favorite Mexican food restaurants, I would go again."}
{"text":"Just like Chipotle, but better! Try the tortilla soup or the enchiladas!"}
{"text":"Good stuff!! Unique flavor.  Quick service.  Definitely worth a try!!"}
{"text":"I didn't understand all the hype to this place. I like that it's set up Chipotle style so you get to pick all your toppings. I just didn't think the enchiladas were that great. When I asked for the green salsa, they pretty much drowned it in it so that was all I tasted. The meat (I had chicken and green chile pork) was ok in flavor. It was a decent place but I don't see myself returning."}
{"text":"I'm usually not a fan of Subway type meals and I did not know that that's what this place was but tried it anyway.  The menu is way above your head, and trying to figure out what you're getting was difficult because I could not understand the person who was serving me; it did not help that the glass wall between the food and the customer was taller than most.   I gave Gadzooks 3 stars because I had the red enchilada sauce and it was anything but special it tasted like something from a can and it gave me heartburn. The meat was okay. I had cross rib in one and the cornbread filling in the other. CORNBREAD filling was the tastiest but the sauce  didnt work.  The staff was ok, friendly but again, it was hard to understand over the glass partition."}
{"text":"Boom-Pop-Pow-Bam  Holy enchiladas Batman!   This is a nifty location, a funky idea, and yummy eats all thrown into a clay dish and roasted over a fire.   The menu is fun, great selection but controlled enough to do what they do exceptionally well. Menu-drawn in chalk, not a unique idea I know but boy does it just fit this place.   You walk to the counter... Kinda like chipotle. Pick your stuff, they cook it in the dish... In the fire.... Right in front of you.   I had a chicken burrito with green chili and a side of con bread.... Oh sorry I'm from the south... Corn bread.  Man it was good. Just a cool experience with a helpful staff and good food.   Nuff respect. You should try it at least once. Cuz cuz cuz I said so. What's the worst that could happen? I'm mean really.   An I'm out....s"}
{"text":"It's OK, I've been there once and I need to go more to experiment with the menu.  The menu is kind of complicated.  I've never made enchiladas so I was lost.  I think they should have favorites or something to that effect to help out ordering"}
{"text":"Gadzooks catered a party we had for 22 people.    The food arrived hot, labeled and included utensils.  Everyone loved it.  The food was delicious (our new favorite)!"}
{"text":"So I Went plain jane today.. Got 2 braised beef enchiladas with green sauce and of course cheese : )  Tried the mashed potatoes this time. They most definitely should be on everyone's To-Eat List. Very creamy till the last drop.. Nom Nom Portions are generous.. My 8 year old and I shared this... and were stuffed."}
{"text":"This place was great. I spent a lot of time in the starbucks across the street doing homework and one day made the adventure across the street with my roommate and it was a great decision. The set up is kind of like Chipotle but the quality of food is so much better and a great variety of flavor. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Great concept and the food looks wonderful.  The staff could be more helpful in guiding you through the steps (especially for first timers). The food looks so good but the taste was very salty.  Among our family we had all the proteins in the enchilada, guacamole and the tortilla and corn chowder soup.  Soups were good, everything else tasted very salty."}
{"text":"Wow... \"...This thing could be nationwide\" Steve says to me... in between shovels of warm, gooey jalapeno corn bread... and boy has he hit the nail on the head... The staff; informative, engaging, entertaining bunch of 'my kind-ofs'.  All I have to say is go... if you're a vegetarian? GO... if you're a meat eater? GO... something out-side-the-box? Go go go."}
{"text":"Love love love this place ... Has somewhat of a chipotle set up but better.   My go to order is two enchiladas on half & half tortillas, one spinach & mushroom other filled with cornbread, a smear of goat cheese on both, cheese, green sauce , medium egg on top and as far as toppings jalapeño ranch, creme & pico   Oh and there chicken tacos are pretty yummy aswell but honestly you can't go wrong with this place ... They have so many goodies tho"}
{"text":"YUMMY. When I do get a minute to run out for lunch (so rare) I RUN to Gadzooks! Never disappoints, thanks guys!"}
{"text":"The food at this place is so good!!  I love everything I've ordered from here. They also have spicy things. I love it! Such great place."}
{"text":"Amazing! Excellent value. The enchiladas are delicious. I didn't know they were fully customizable, but they are. You can't really go wrong with any of the choices.  As for soup, there is only one kind of soup, but it's as customizable as the enchiladas. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Quirkly good... Aligned with other reviews, it is similar to a Chipotle, but with enchiladas as the main fare. The ordering process is a bit clumsy, but the results are darn good.  I opted for a mix of veggies enchiladas - smashed potatoes, spinach, etc.. They are hand rolled and topped with the sauce of your choice. They add a few options - cheese, pico, etc.. that you can choose from.  The end result was top notch. Spicy, but not overpowering. Hot, but not so burning hot that I could not eat it immediately.   The chips was really good as well.  Stop in, piece together enchiladas your style, pop a squat and enjoy. I will be back...."}
{"text":"We drive by this place all the time and finally decided to stop in,  so glad we did!  We had tacos and enchiladas,  and it was delicious.  The jalapeño ranch was an awesome recommendation from the staff.  Staff was courteous,  polite and patient.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The line to order is very congested and is not efficient (be prepared to be 25 min waiting in line), of course if the food was any good you could ingore this, but the salsa was just hot without any flavour and the food was very blend. Is a cool concept that wasn't well executed."}
{"text":"Never disappointed!! Friendly staff, awesome good, go sangrias and cookies! Hit the spot!!"}
{"text":"Marvelous dinner for two tonight and the first time we were at Gadzooks.  A novice at ordering enchiladas with the fillings and add-ins and toppings a mystery, we took the advice of a few male prep cooks and were very pleased.  I had green chilies pork and my son had the short rib enchilada.  Took the advice of another reviewer and ordered the Christmas sauces, both red and green - great choice!  The hand smashed guacamole is a great addition.  The flavors were so fresh and the presentation delectable.  Cheers for the staff, they really brightened our evening and made us feel comfortable.  We will definitely be going again!  On the way out I saw the chopped salads being made and this is on my list for next time around."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I highly recommend the green chili pork shoulder and short rib enchilada Christmas style along with tortilla soup. They were both absolutely RIPPIN!! Highly recommended. Also got one of the best margaritas in the valley. We will become regulars here in now time at all."}
{"text":"The most flavorful food with great presentation. I had one bison and one braised rib enchilada and the flavors where best in town. Must eat at."}
{"text":"Ate there for the first time today as everyone continued to rave about it. Although the spinach and mushroom mixture was good I was not impressed. Too pricey for what you get and the green sauce tasted like you were sucking on nothing but lime."}
{"text":"Yum!!  First time eating here and I can't wait to come back.  Loved the guajillo braised short rib and red sauce!!  Linda's homemade tortilla soup with chicken...perfect amount of spice with wonderful flavor."}
{"text":"Never had anything resembling a bad experience here. Food is always good, the staff is quick and always recommending something. I'm in and out in 5 minutes and pleased with my visit."}
{"text":"Gadzooks is one of my favorite places in Phoenix to eat.  I live nowhere close but will absolutely drive here just to eat.  It's like Chipotle (but better) for enchiladas.  First, you start with this incredible tortilla that is their own 50/50 blend and then add your fillings and toppings.  They have some wonderful veggie fillings like spinach and mushrooms.  I usually get the chicken and a side of cornbread.  Cornbread?  Yes, it will blow your mind so do not miss it.  Next you choose a sauce, I go for the verde because I'm #teamgreenchile and love the spicy sweetness.  The red is also good and packs a powerful smoky flavor.  Then I load up with both jack and cheddar cheeses and it gets tossed in the oven to get gooey and magical.  Then I'm topping it all off with pico, habanero salsa, pickled red onion, and crema.  It's just so damn delicious that you will not be able to get enough.  Stop reading this review and get yourself to Gadooks."}
{"text":"Friggin delicious. The tortillas, meats, cheeses, and sauces are all delicious and combine to form highly crave-able enchiladas. My favorite is green-everything (pork, sauce, etc.)."}
{"text":"Delicious food!!!  This concept is amazing!!  Everything is good...short rib and green chili chicken is my favorite!!  Then there is the jack potatoes...yes potatoes which are amazing!!!  The corn bread is yummy but has a good kick!  The chips are super crunchy, I could eat the whole bag!  Then finish the meal off with a pumpkin cookie....omg good!!!    Wish there was a location in the west valley, but it's well worth the drive!!!  Can't wait to go again"}
{"text":"In essence this restaurant is a Chipotle, but with enchiladas instead of burritos. The food is good, but I feel I paid a bit too much for two enchiladas. Still, if you got the coin and want to try a tasty, trendy restaurant then give this place a shot."}
{"text":"FABULOUS - No words needed but Yelp wants me to say more.  Give it a try, don't think you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"I first noticed Gadzooks when I was getting my morning dose of caffeine at the Starbucks across the street. Ended up deciding to come back after church for a quick lunch.  The ordering process is similar to Chipotle. They offer enchiladas, tacos, salads and soup. I went for the enchiladas and did one chicken and one short rib. I have my eye on the smashed jack potatoes or the sweet and spicy cornbread next time. I went with the half flour half corn tortillas, both cheeses (jack and cheddar) and their red sauce as I prefer non-spicy.  My enchiladas went into the oven similar to what you'd see at a quick bake pizza place like Fired Pie and were ready quickly. There are ample options to top the enchiladas with.  The staff was friendly and helpful as I navigated all the options for the first time. I wish the menu was easier to view from where you stand as move down the line ordering. A stack of menus at the start of the line would solve the problem.  The concept is fun and unique. I'll be back to try more enchiladas soon!"}
{"text":"Do not be intimidated by the ordering process. The staff will walk you through the process and the results are worth the effort. We told the person sitting next to us at a Diamondbacks game where we were planning to eat at the end of the game. He told us that we should go to Gadzooks instead. The food is very good - perhaps what Chipotle would like to be able to serve. The prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"This is my first time here. Man, it was SO good! Not what I expected all! WAY better then chipotle for sure! They mean business, stuff is spicy here. I don't like burn your face off but usually places hottest sauce is perfect. Not the case here- the hottest salsa was so hot there was no way I could eat it! Super yummy, and will be back!"}
{"text":"We love this place and the concept! Great food! Simple menu of enchiladas, tacos, and soup! Never had anything bad!"}
{"text":"They have an excellent vegetarian options, great tasting ready made white wine sangria and some very good pumpkin cookies."}
{"text":"Hesitantly tried a cornbread enchilada and I must say it was surprisingly delicious. The verde chicken was just okay but the sauces guac & melted cheese made everything better! I'll be back to try out more stuff!"}
{"text":"I usually eat at this place 8 times a year and the vibe was different tonight.  We ordered as usual but now there is an emo dude that's serves Dainty portions and created an awkward moment when requesting a double portion. Maybe he needs more training. Long story short the line leader made it right.  4 stars."}
{"text":"This is a fancier, more expensive and slightly unhealthy version of Chipotle.   Pros: Food selection is good if slightly unhealthy. Ingredients are fresh. Decor is great.  Cons: More expensive than chipotle and chipotle has more flavor. Unhealthy sauce and cheese selections. Food is somewhat bland and flavors are muted."}
{"text":"This has to be my favorite place to go eat in Phoenix. I absolutely love the enchiladas. The entire concept of the restaurant is brilliant. It's like a chipotle for enchiladas, But way better. Sometimes it gets pretty busy at lunch so timing is important, but that just goes to show you how good this place is. I cannot recommend this place enough gadzooks is the bomb.com."}
{"text":"Good food, fun vegan and vegetarian choices.   The sweet and spicy cornbread filling in an enchilada is amazing.   Thumbs up."}
{"text":"Great food. It's got flavor and it tastes fresh. It was the perfect lunch on a cold and rainy day. I had three enchiladas with green and red sauce and some fantastic habanero sauce. Did not leave disappointed and hope to come back soon."}
{"text":"I wish this place was closer to my house! I think I would be there everyday! I got 2 enchiladas with the 1/2 and 1/2 tortilla with one mashed potato and one with chicken! I think I could of eaten a whole bowl of mashed potato. They add either green or red, or even both sauces and cheese and put it in their brick oven and add some cabbage slaw! Everything just tasted so fresh! I will be going back very soon!"}
{"text":"Yummy Yummy, get in my Tummy!  This place was awesome!  So my lady and I were craving some Mexican food and were thinking about Carolina's, or Most Wanted Taco Shop. Well my brother recommended Gadzook's so we wanted to give it a try.  I'm glad we did.  This place was amazing!  We ordered some taco's and enchiladas.  We sampled the three different meats, short rib, green chile pork and chicken.  All the meats were braised and had were super flavorful.  The concept is a lot like Chipotle or Cafe Rio, but the food was a lot more tasteful.  You'll notice the difference when you sample their meats.  You order from the counter and they make your food right in front of you.  A lot of different options, with their sauces, cheeses, and salsa's.  In conclusion, if you like Chipotle, please give this place a try.  It blows Chipotle out of the water!  I'm a little upset I didn't find this place sooner.  I highly recommend and will be going back soon!"}
{"text":"We stopped in on a whim and we were glad we did. This is no ordinary taco shop! We ordered two smashed jack potato/marinated spinach & mushroom enchiladas, covered in spicy green sauce with just a touch of homemade guacamole and two orders of tortilla soup. I went with the corn tortillas, which are thick and did not get soggy and disintegrate as soon as the sauce touched them. The flavor of everything was outstanding and the portions were just right. I have no need for a burrito that weighs as much as a bowling ball although I realize that for some people, more food = more value. I will take more flavor anytime. For the meat eaters, I noticed that they have short rib, bison, chicken, and I am sure some type of beef but I wasn't pay that close of attention to that. The menu is simple but there is a wide variety of toppings and fillings to customize your order. The prices are reasonable, too. The enchiladas, soups, and three drinks came to a grand total of $20.13 and we were more than satisfied. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious with great gluten free options! My favorite is a taco with half potato and half short rib topped with the cabbage and pickle onion and a side of the tomatillo salsa."}
{"text":"This place is great.   They are doing a great job considering they haven't even had their grand opening yet!  Food is delicious, staff is helpful and nice and they all really want to know how to make everything better and are actively working on it. I did not find the menu confusing, you choose your tortilla, filling, cheese sauce and topping ... not hard.   Keep it up! You're doing a great job and you can only get better from here :)"}
{"text":"So I have a love-hate relationship with Gadzooks....  Love, because their food is oh so delicious. Hate, because I can never stop eating when I'm there. Gadzookz is often compared to Chipotle but it's so much more than that. You can choose between tacos, nachos, a salad or their famous enchiladas. The protein options are super unique - braised short rib, Modelo-braised bison, and spicy cornbread to name a few! Once your tacos, enchiladas, etc. are stuffed theyre topped with shredded cheese and placed into an oven to get all ooey gooey.   Even the toppings are exquisite! My favorite is the perfectly pickled red onions. You can top off your meal with chips, tortilla soup, or delicious homemade pumpkin cookies.   The line for lunch is always out the door and for good reason! This has definitely become a staple for my coworkers and I!"}
{"text":"Love Gadzooks!! This is one of my favorite neighborhood joints :) I love their white wine sangria...I'm not sure if it's always available, but if you see it then you must try it! You will not be disappointed! Lines can get a little long, since everything is made to order. However, it is definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I love the concept of this place. Build your own enchiladas or tacos?! Yes please! This was my first time here so I decided to try as many combinations as possible for my enchiladas. One corn tortilla, one 50/50 tortilla, tomatillo chicken, green chile pork, Christmas style with the sauces and both kinds of cheese. They shove it in the oven and gooey cheesy magic happens. Topped mine off with green & red salsas, slaw, guacamole, and crema. So freaking good, it's not even funny. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Second time to Gadzook's. Less crowded. The food is tasty, but bit spendy. They really need to come up with a different shaped plate for tacos, perhaps one with little dividers that hold taco up, otherwise the tortillas sit in juice and you end up eating like an enchilada."}
{"text":"Lots of choices at this build-your-own enchilada or taco restaurant. The tomatillo chicken was delicious, as well as the green chile pork. They put it all together assembly line style. Worth a try."}
{"text":"Went there with high expectations.. Did not find the food that good.. It was an ok experience.. I like Mexican food spicy but this place disappointed me on the spice level I expect from Mexican food.. The red sauce a huge disappointment.. The meat filling options for the burrito are very few..  I have been to better mexican restaurants.."}
{"text":"This is my go to place. Sometimes I come here 3 times a week.. The food is innovative, fresh and delicious. I've tried all the meat, but the best by far is the short rib. I always do the half and half tortillas because I hate how corn fall apart. Both cheeses and Christmas sauce is the way to go! The pico recently got a lot spicier because they add jalapeño now, so I go a little easier on that. Then I drown my melty enchiladas in the gadzooks buttermilk, crema and cotija. Incredible dressing! The salads are also good and large. They chop everything together with a large blade. Try the gadzooks buttermilk and short rib. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I really like the style and menu. Really loved the short rib enchilada and the corn bread enchilada ! The salsa and sauces are great. I will be back."}
{"text":"This place is so fun! I live in the east valley and my friend lives on the west side, so we love to find places to meet in Phoenix. This was the perfect spot. I tend to ask a million questions and the staff was more than happy to explain  anything and everything to me! I also love that they have red cream soda. It might look exactly like Chipotle but the flavor and quality is way better! Perfect Saturday afternoon lunch place."}
{"text":"Mmmm Mmmm this place is absolutely AMAZING! Tried it for the first time last week, had a Chipotle like feel to it, but it is way better. Definitely recommend to anyone looking for a quick home style enchilada."}
{"text":"Amazing concept. Clean restaurant with fantastic service and food. I've paid MUCH more for much less quality. We will be back... probably too frequently."}
{"text":"The best mexican I've had in ages. Tops chipotle by a long shot. I wished I lived in PHX to get to enjoy this delight haha"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! The people in front of us and working were so kind. I loved how they actually \"chop\" the salad. Unlike any place I've ever been."}
{"text":"I stopped by Gadzooks on my lunch break. I was looking for a quick and delicious lunch and Gadzooks sure did satisfy. My co-worker and I were both quite impressed with the flavor, super yummy. It took about 10 minutes to get through the line which is not too bad in my opinion. I took the food to go. The restaurant was very crowded and a little small as was the parking lot. But all in all, I would be willing to eat here again! Maybe, I'll try the salad next time!"}
{"text":"A coworker and I stopped in here for lunch today after hearing about it from a friend. The parking situation was pretty rough but after circling the block once or twice we got a spot. Right off the bat I noticed the authentic vibe of the place and the menu was super unique. Of course I got the enchiladas as did most of the patrons as far as I could tell. They let you customize the ingredients from the stuffing to the cheeses to the salsas and toppings. They also bake the enchilada right there in front of you once they make it. I ended up getting the spinach mushroom stuffing and it was absolutely delicious. I really want to give a five star but the prices and parking bring it down to four...for now. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went back to give it another shot (now that we had experience ordering).  I really wanted to try the bison which was out the first time.  Now the bison is only available at lunch...huh?!?!?!!   This time was total opposite...the food was not very good but the service was really great.  I had the potato enchilada and the chicken enchilada...pieces of the chicken were almost inedible, almost like they mixed overcooked, old chicken in with new chicken that was cooked OK.  The chicken alone ruined the whole meal.  There's a slim chance I would give it another shot, but with that chicken and now bison only at lunch...probably not."}
{"text":"This is a slightly fancier version of chipotle. Fancier, because the enchiladas are heated up. You choose your enchilada fillings; I got one with beef and one with pulled pork. On top, I added a mole (sp?) sauce, tomatoes, pickled onion (that's a unique topping!), cabbage, shredded cheese, and crema (aka: sour cream typa thang). Overall, very tasty and would recommend the pulled pork. Still, the sign outside said enchiladas and soup: where the soup at? Did my eyes miss it on the menu? Finally, it was so hot inside. Coming from a hot outside, it was uncomfortable to be eating warm food in a hot room... Nevertheless, service was very friendly and would return again"}
{"text":"I'd base it 5 stars based on the food but the service was out of control terrible. We travel from the east valley to come here so Im not sure if this is normal for them. I hope they were training new people or something and this is not normal. The entire restaurant had empty tables with no one eating while the line wrapped back by the bathrooms. The line was barely moving and I saw several people leaving. I was shocked at how ineffecient the workers were at taking our order and making the food once we finally got to the counter. The one black girl in the back was basically doing everything and working her tail off while the two young girls in the line just looked around confused. You just can't have a line wrapping around the restaurant like that and no one who has food. See pics."}
{"text":"Fun and quirky. Great price point foe fresh food. Very casual... not sure what we were expecting, but it was yummy and we weren't disappointed."}
{"text":"Love this place.  It's a build-your-own enchilada - like a much classier (and tastier) version of Chipotle.  You pick from a decent list of everything, then they throw it in an oven to cook it up as you progress through the line.  Great concept for enchiladas, and I love the results.  I'm always super satisfied and pleasantly full, and the pricing is pretty decent.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Fun concept that works with the quality of the food they serve. Enchiladas and tacos are primarily their forte. The short ribs are smokey with some zip. Chicken is light and mild but flavorful. The selection of topping is original and the slaw is tasty."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now, at first I was really excited but have liked it less and less. I've figured out that I find the meats themselves really bland, and the sauces to be overly seasoned. Maybe it's the toppings I use but with a pretty standard mix the flavors don't blend well and after a few bites I just don't enjoy the meal. I also agree with everyone else on the confusing order setup."}
{"text":"I'm a lover if more traditional mexican food. So my review probably more of a preference. I went for lunch. My first mistake. Parking very limited. Inside Nice clean...line almost out the door. In this heat, not a good thing. Interesting concept. However have to better judge cooking time. Once something burned.  That flavor is in all the food. Having a designated person do the cooking to better watch & a designated person to chop the salad would make more sense. Particularly during rush times. It took half hour to get thru line. Even the girl at the register was chopping salads. Hmmm.... Then no bag to carry food?  Really? Get rid if the sleeve for the to go orders. Nobody cares & it takes too much time. If you don't watch your order  there is large margin for error. Salsa I got & Guacamole overpowered by onion. The chicken & pork were ok. The potato,  to me, overpowered by onion. I'm not an onion lover so options would be nice in that aspect. For what I paid,   the time it took & inconvenience of balancing my food while Trying to open the  door & gate, burned oniony food..my money better spent elsewhere where I have more options. But gave it a try. Oh...the cornbread was good & spicy. Best part of my lunch."}
{"text":"We love it here! Always seem to miss out on the model braised bison. But everything else, from the green Chile pork and braised short ribs to the smashed Yukon golds and sweet and spicy cornbread is amazing! Location is awesome too!"}
{"text":"Took off one point for the fact that this place really needs some blinds...seriously the staff and the customers are blinded by the sun shining in your face or reflecting off the glass"}
{"text":"Gotta say, AGAIN, this place is absolutely incredible!! I don't understand the comments about the staff being sullen or uncaring....every single time I've been in, the staff have been welcoming, friendly and knowledgeable! And the food simply cannot be beat. BEST enchiladas I have EVER had. If they sold the half corn/half flour tortillas by the dozen, I'd be in heaven. The guacamole is ALSO the best I've ever had, but by far my favorite thing on the menu are the smashed jack potato enchiladas! Perfect Mexican food with a modern twist! And I'm not a huge fan of spice or food drowning in sauce, so recently when one of the staff recommended I try it with just cheese & crema....let's just say my whole world was rocked. I'd eat there every single day if I could! And oh my goodness, the pumpkin cookies that are by the register are worth the trip in and of themselves!! If you have not tried this place yet, do yourself a favor and get there asap!!! This place is an absolute treasure in the Valley!!!"}
{"text":"OMG.  I hate reviews that start that way but it's the best I can do this place is awesome think of chipotle in its early years. Fresh food great flavors and good prices. Staff is friendly and very helpful in talking you through the process  will be coming back for more"}
{"text":"GADZOOKS!!! The name says it all.... I have been waiting for this place to open and have been folowing on Facebook for months and when I finally heard there was going to be a soft open/ lunch service I jumped at the opportunity to full fill my enchilada craving.  As everybody has been saying the owner Aaron was very helpful and a shorter man that had a striking resemblance to Sean Astin (the guy from Rudy/ Lord of The Rings) was also very informative about the menu. I ate the short rib enchilada and the chicken, both took me on a one way trip straight to flavor town. If it was winter and I was wearing socks.... they would have been blown off.   \"On top\" you have got to get the Guac, it cost a little extra, but trust me.... just trust me K!!  One thing I was not expecting was to see somebody hand making tortillas and asking me, \"corn\" or \"50/50\" (a half corn half flour tortilla). Knowing full well that swimsuit season is just around the corner I decided what the heck, 50/50.... and for those of you that don't know, 50+50=100. and those tortillas are 100% delicious.   A side of chips came in handy to scoop up the remaining guac, sauce and cheese left from my devouring of the Lada. I cant tell you how many times I have been to a Mexican food place and the integrity of the tortilla chip was compromised with every returning dip to the salsa bowl or guac. If the dip was the battlefield, these chips are the Sherman Tank of WW2 that plowed through the field and won the war in Europe. After my trek trough the dip i tossed that bad boy in my mouth and all the sudden it was no longer a tank, but rather a hot air balloon, light and crisp, the perfect chip each time.  I am excited to return and try the Spinach and mushroom enchilada and the \"smashed\" potato enchilada. I am not a Vegetarian but like Pokemon, I gotta catch em all!!! I am thrilled to have a great patio spot on the way home from work to stop and grab a bite and beer before heading home to my nagging roommate.   A great addition to the local feel that CenPho is developing!!!"}
{"text":"So this might have been an ad hoc decision, however this establishment delivered for what we needed. We were about 14 of us that needed food stat, and they were very facilitating. Much appreciated. Sure it is the Mexican cuisine version of subway kind of.. but quite tasty still. In fact I will have to come back just to verify is sober Mar would appreciate it as much as slightly inebriated Mar!!  But everything I tasted was good, except the nachos. Quite boring nachos. But my enchiladas was tasty. The guac was totally OK. The strange sauce my enchiladas came with was great. The jalapeno ranch did it's thing. Yeah, it was tasty and decent.. considering it is what it is.  When reading other yelpers review I might just have missed out on the corn bread."}
{"text":"This place has been open for about a few months and I haven't been here until yesterday.  WOW!  This is some good food for not a whole lot of money."}
{"text":"Great! Such an awesome place with a unique vibe. Make sure to try the mashed potatoes and corn bread stuff! Delicious!"}
{"text":"I come here way too often, but the enchiladas are so good. You can get up to three and try up to five different fillings. It's got a chipotle style of ordering only you don't have to worried about them busting your burrito and it's more delicious.   Both their red and green sauces are good but I prefer the red cause it's spicier and has a bit more flavor. Their jalapeño ranch dressing makes a pretty great topping for both salads an enchiladas, and they stock a decent variety of beers.   The only problem: they don't have enough locations."}
{"text":"Wow, what a  solid enchilada! It's kind of Chipotle style where you pick your meats and toppings and sauces etc, but way better quality. i went with the braised short rib, took  both red and green sauce and had them top it off with a fried egg. If that's not enchilada porn to you, we can't be friends. all in all, soild food at a great price!"}
{"text":"Wow, this place really impressed me.  Super delicious homemade enchiladas, tacos, and soup.  The tortillas are amazing, love the half corn half flour.  And the cornbread is the best ever!  Will be going here often."}
{"text":"This place is not the buizness. I got tacos which I can't believe were $7. Whathehell we live in AZ tacos are like cactus here......everywhere!!!!!!! So as I'm sitting there surrounded by hella white ppl I'm thinking why am I here. My niece didn't even like her chicken tacos, how does a kid not like tacos. That was a wrap for me but my friend keeps telling me it's not the tacos it's the enchiladas. I don't know if I can do it again. Buena suerte?"}
{"text":"I am so disappointed! I live by the Phoenix 7th Street location, and I am a frequent customer as I like their enchiladas, but I became hooked on their cornbread when my boyfriend bought it once.  However, last night, right before closing, I walked in (not realizing they were trying to close), and the guy who was locking and cleaning up seemed disappointed that I walked in.  I continued to the line and they were out of a lot of stuff, but I did not complain, in fact, I apologized that I was ordering so late because they looked like they were unhappy that we were there (me and another lady). Despite wanting beef enchiladas, I opted for the pork since they beef was gone. I didn't want to be more of a pain. I asked if they had more cornbread, and the gal said yes and pulled out a new, hot pan filled with it, which made me happy! She then asked me and the lady in front of me if we wanted free cornbread and we both said, \"Yes!\" When I got home, the cornbread was extremely spicy.  We had to eat is slowly and didn't enjoy it at all, so we stopped eating. The next morning we were both sick. I called the manager and told him what happened. I explained that there were a lot of peppers in the bread, which I did not notice in the past. He said they always put \"serrano peppers\" in the bread; however, the batch of serranos was a little spicier.  I told him I had never had that problem, and I eat there all the time. I then told him I would not be eating there again, and he said, \"OK, have a good night.\"  The employees always seemed unhappy and there is no customer appreciation."}
{"text":"An experience like no other. Great fillings make for great enchiladas and tacos. Love the build your own concept especially the fried egg! I've been here a few times and had the opportunity trying the modelo braised bison that usually finishes around noon. It's good I think it lacked a bit in flavor but what do I know lol. Tried the soup and was just not impressed. Left it after three or four spoonfuls. The enchis keep me coming back!"}
{"text":"Great place for tacos or enchiladas.  Same concept as a  Chipotle, build your plate as you go. Definitely worth checking out.  Place is small but going on off peak hours should get you a seat."}
{"text":"This is Chipotle of enchiladas, but better! Choose the protein, choose sauces and toppings, in the oven it goes and out comes magic! Delicious enchiladas made to order, quick, affordable and plain right delicious. Please come to Chandler Gadzooks!"}
{"text":"I've been driving by this unassuming place on my way to work for about a month now and I never would have imagined the deliciousness that was awaiting for me inside. The staff was friendly and helpful with the Menu, the meat was perfectly seasoned (Being Puerto Rican I know), the sauces, cremas, and vegetables where fresh. It's an ideal place to eat a taco,enchilada, or soup with a simple semi modern twist. The question is not if I'm going back but when? \"Gadzooks\" this place great!"}
{"text":"Just the smell in this place is amazing!!!  You can't go wrong with anything on this menu of you like Mexican food. My personal favorite is the enchiladas with chicken with red sauce.  Don't pass up a side of the corn bread and one of their cookies, either!   Delicious!   Only negative, the line can be pretty long. The line moves pretty fast, but still it can be long. Give yourself time of your going at peak lunch hours."}
{"text":"Amazing, fresh, creative and friendly. One of the best places to eat in Phoenix for a quick meal. So good!"}
{"text":"Just had the most amazingly delicious Party with a capital P, in my mouth! First time here, but not my last! Had the 50/50 tortillas, one pork, one chicken, green sauce, baked and bubbling to perfection, out of the oven drizzled with fresh scratch made crema, crumbled cotija cheese, and vinaigrette slaw topping it all off. Side of hand-smashed guacamole made it complete. Can't wait to try some secret menu items, I was made aware of tonight! Thanks Eric! ;-)"}
{"text":"One of our favorite lunch spots! Fresh and delicious - you won't be disappointed. The line could get long if you are there during the noon hour but it's worth it. I usually get 3 enchiladas - one with bison, one chicken and one pork. The hand made 50/50 tortillas are the bomb. I get both red and green sauce and both types of cheese. I like to add medium salsa but then top with the cabbage slaw, guava and crema."}
{"text":"We tried this place after seeing it on Check Please Arizona. It is set up kind of like a Chipotle but with enchiladas and soup. I got braised short rib enchiladas for 8.25. That is very reasonable. I added on a smear of goat cheese for 1.25. You order it at the counter and then it goes in a brick oven to make the cheese bubbly and delicious. The flavors of the enchilada were very good without being overly spicy. I def think this would do well with multiple locations. Fast, fresh, reasonable and delicious!"}
{"text":"Big time great experience.    Food was right on.  I had the  braised bison enchiladas.   YUM.  and the pumpkin cookies were to die for too.   Great place to enjoy some delish grub."}
{"text":"Not your typical Mexican enchilada.  Food is good, great customer service and looks a clean please for a nice conversation.  Prices are very reasonable around $7 per person."}
{"text":"Love this place - thankful it's not closer to work or home or I would eat here way to often.  Food is fresh - love the different options for enchiladas - such variety and unique. Guacamole is very good. Well done!!"}
{"text":"Amazing ! Really flavorful \"build your own\" Mexican food. You can choose the type of carbs you want whether it's forties or enchiladas (their most known for) or their other choices ! Their meats are really full of flavor and after your pick of toppings, everything is heated up in a Masonry oven (not your conventional oven or a microwave but almost like those stone made open flame pizza oven). Food was nice and hot, fresh, cheese melted perfectly. Staff was nice with explaining everything as it was our first time there. 10/10 would come again !"}
{"text":"That's a spicy meatball! Or in Gadzooks' case an enchilada. They do enchiladas and they do them very well. There are tons of different combinations of mixings and ingredients you can choose from to build your own enchilada. Tons of different meats, sauces, and veggies to choose from. You could really try a new flavor combination every time you go in. The atmosphere here and the patio make for a great time. They also have several bottled beers available for purchase that would compliment your meal very well. The staff members here were also very nice and helpful to my friends and I when we told them this was our first visit. The cashier even brought us over samples of the various meets so we could try each type.   I really enjoyed this place and I am looking forward to trying more of their food in the future."}
{"text":"Best described as \"the Chipotle of enchiladas!\" Basically you choose everything you want from how many, what kind of tortilla, meat or no meat, plus a variety of fixings & toppings! It's fast casual dining at an afforable price. Always delicious, never disappointing. Today, I got 2 Roasted Tomatillo Chicken in Scratch-Made Half n' Half Corn Flour tortillas with Green Sauce, both cheeses & Uncle Rico's Pico on top + a side of Sweet & Spicy Cornbread, guacamole & chips. Best lunch I've had in a long time!"}
{"text":"First time eating here, and was nothing but impressed. The staff were super friendly and helpful. Price point is great. And the food was delicious. I got the spicy potato soup, and my dad got one pork and one chicken enchilada. Everything was very fresh. Highly recommend! And will definitely come back. Apparently the festival taco won first place at the taco festival this year, next time I will definitely be trying that!"}
{"text":"I was a bit confused with the menu when I first  went here, but definitely got it now. I have only had their food twice and loved it. I had the Chicken Tortilla soup with their homemade chips the first visit and Chicken street tacos the 2nd visit. I have no complaints and I found my new favorite chips.   Lines are long. But they move it pretty fast. Park g lot is also very tight."}
{"text":"Amazing enchiladas! My mouth is watering just writing this review. I got 2 enchiladas one chicken and one with short rib. SO GOOD! I also ordered the soup with chicken which was also very delicious. But next time I am just going to stick with enchiladas because it was alot of food and if I had to choose between the 2 it would be the enchiladas. Good size and completely customized to your liking. I can not wait to go back. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Update: I just received a phone call from Jared Poole. We discussed what happened the day I was in. He apologized and validated my complaint. That alone deserves 5 stars. To put forth the effort. To care about customer service. Thank you Mr. Poole and Gadzooks! You are stand-up.   I have always enjoyed coming here. The last time I was at this establishment it was not so good of an experience. I tried to order the nachos, I noticed their chips (which are homemade there in house) had salt. I have a condition called Meniere's, if I consume too much salt it can send me into extreme vertigo. When I questioned about the salted chips the gal with the blue/purple hair said, \"Well, everything else has salt in it.\" That's all she had to offer. And she wasn't nice about it. I thought maybe, just maybe, they could fry up a fresh batch of unsalted corn tortillas to make unsalted chips. I was sorely mistaken. I can go to any establishment that makes fresh and request unsalted chips and most often they are happy to accommodate. I was terribly disappointed because the food is otherwise very good. I did try to contact the owner to discuss this issue and that was over a week ago. I have yet to hear back from him. Thanks for showing care and compassion Mr. Po"}
{"text":"First impression was great! Super friendly people here. The food is delicious. Nice and clean I tried the chicken on flour with green salsa and loved them. Im definitely coming back to try more of their food. Try it out guys this place is great! Just a little hard to get out of during rush hours"}
{"text":"Great, great food! I tried this place for the first time last week and just made lunch plans to go back today :)"}
{"text":"Gadzooks is definitely an interesting concept ... like Chipotle, except with enchiladas! We read some reviews and decided to check them out for dinner. They seemed to be having a little bit of an off night as they were out of the containers that they heat up the enchiladas in. I'm not sure if it was a result of that or not but the staff was not friendly & seemed really frazzled. We said it was okay if they made our food in to-go containers after they had told us it would take just a little bit longer. They weren't much help when I asked for recommendations so I suggest coming prepared by asking someone who's been here before, reading reviews, etc.  As far as the food goes - it was good. I got the two enchiladas combo with roasted tomatillo chicken, green sauce, cheese, salsa verde, crema, and slaw. After only the first bite, I wished I hadn't gotten the green sauce on top because everything else was so flavorful it really wasn't necessary. The green sauce just made everything spicy which is unfortunate because I'm not a huge fan of a lot of spice. I'd definitely get it without next time. My date got the spinach & mushroom filling one with the potatoes and it was delicious! We both thought the salsas were good and the crema seem to bring everything together. Definitely get that on top!  Like I said, I think they were having an off night with service, but I think we'd come back to give them another chance since the food was good."}
{"text":"I love enchiladas. They are my favorite Mexican food.   When I saw this place - I thought \"What? An enchilada-only place?\" I think it blew my mind. Coming from NYC, should expect the \"specialty\" restaurants that specialize in one type of food only (e.g. Mac and cheese, meatballs, etc.) but in Phoenix?   Anyway, a friend and I stopped there on a whim. I was not surprised, but amazed at how good this was. The concept is really \"line\" style - (read: Subway) where you pick your tortilla, then your meat, then your toppings and slide on down.   I ordered 2 enchiladas. First, the tortillas. I did the half wheat/half corn. They are super soft and chewy, with a soft texture. Next, the chicken and then the cheesy potato fillers. Both delicious. Gadzooks offers two vegetarian options: one is potato/cheese for the filler and the second is spinach. Then the topping - green salsa please. Some cheese on top - and into the oven it goes to warm up and crisp up the cheese on top. Just like a pizza.   The last time I was there - I tried the tortilla soup. I love tortilla soup - in all kinds and types. This was rich and perfectly seasoned. I will definitely get it again."}
{"text":"Once again.  It has been busy and hectic the last month or so of this year.   Gadzooks one of the best places I have eaten at.  I ate here today and had the same soup as this time.  I like this place because they serve bison.  I get the bison in the soup too.  The food is always good and fresh too.  It can get a little hectic though if you get there during the lunch rush.  I like to get there at 11 am before it starts."}
{"text":"I came in because I saw soups on the sign but I didn't see any offered inside, kind of a buzz kill. As far as the enchilada goes I found it to be tasty and inventive dish but it kind of loses it's appeal when it is assembled like a Pontiac.   But when these things come out of the paint booth the perfectly browned cheese is quite attractive and then you can customize the exterior to your tastes. The only main enchilada ingredient they offered that I really had any interest in was the buffalo. Since I had already decided to blow my entire non-dairy, no-animal thing I thought bison does bring nutritional benefit and hay, if I'm gonna cheese it up, may as well go all in. So no soup, no bison, I'm bummed.  I ended up splitting two enchiladas, one potato and a spinach-mushroom, both were a good choice. The food is good but I wish they had some salt shakers on the table. The guy saucing our enchiladas was making a big deal about the heat from the habenero sauce and I said, pile it on but after tasting it I can't see why it couldn't second as a cooling salve for heat rash. Again, salt shakers would wake it up but admire and applaud their season to tastability product that can let the diner make it perfect. All the ingredients are fresh and tasty, even the hab sauce.   Too bad they can't come up with a sliced jicama enchilada in lieu of tortillas for those of us wanting to get our veg freak on. As far as the meats, two high school kids thought they were the best they had ever had, maybe it's a kid thing."}
{"text":"Gadzooks is a casual place, where you order at the counter and then choose seating inside or outside on a covered patio.  The staff was very friendly, greeting us and guiding us through our first ordering experience. The menu is short, simple, bursting with flavor and very well planned out. Step 1: choose between 2 tacos, 2 enchiladas (or 1 each) on corn or flour tortillas made right in front of you or soup and salad.  I chose a smashed jack potato taco and a sautéed spinach mushroom enchilada, both on corn tortillas. Step 2: red or green sauce. The logical choice was red sauce over the enchilada and nothing over the smashed jack potato taco. Step 3: your choice of asadero or Chihuahua cheese. While, usually my answer to this question would be both, I opted to try only the lighter, asadero alone, so I could fully appreciate its flavor. At this point, my beautiful concoction was placed into an open oven, where I could see the white cheese melting into delicious, gooey goodness. Step 4: choose a salsa. Though they all sounded delicious, salsa verdes are always my first choice. Finally, you can pick chips and guacamole or salsa and your beverage.   We paid and made our way to a table inside. Our food looked tasty and the presentation was nice, with the meals served in individual clay pots. My first bite of the spinach enchilada was exploding with the flavors in the red sauce, made with dry roasted red peppers. The mild jack and salsa verde rounded out the flavors without adding more heat. As incredible as my enchilada was, I have to say the taco was my favorite. The smashed jack potato filling plus the salsa verde was an even better flavor combination. I loved the texture of the potato and the chives were a great touch too. Morgan thoroughly enjoyed picks as well, a green chile pork enchilada with asadero cheese and green chile sauce (yeah, he really likes green chile) and a roasted tomatillo chicken enchilada with asadero and red sauce. The guacamole was a tasty side and a local brew completed my meal. I am thrilled that Gadzooks is in walking distance and I will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients, delicious food, good service.  Minus 1 star b'c it was a little confusing to get around the menu and for a buffet line with people behind the counter making your food, the whole process didn't run very efficiently.  Overall though, great experience."}
{"text":"Delicious. Right near my ob offices and I haven't had many pregnancy cravings but this place is becoming an addiction. It is so good! No wonder parking is hard and the line is almost always out the door.  It is spicy. Like almost anything you get will end up being spicy, even the pico has jalepenos. But it is really good. I want to try a salad next time, but the enchiladas just call my name. I have only tried the short rib and the pork, but both were good. I agree with the tips about to go containers. Both times I've done it it seems they over cook my food and it sticks to the container. Not burned or anything but just like 30 seconds too long and I have to scrape it off haha. Still good though, totally worth it.   Price wise it's a bit expensive but you get what you pay for here and it's worth it!!! Yum yum!"}
{"text":"First time here. I had the short ribs. The flavor was perfect and the meat was so tender. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I wanted a casual, easy dinner yesterday and met up with my brothers to try this place.  It's an interesting concept, similar to other fast-casual concepts in that there are a multitude of options for constructing a personalized meal    We all opted for enchiladas.  Mine were on the 50/50 tortillas, a combo of corn and flour.  One was filled with cheese and the other was filled with a spicy cornbread mixture recommended by my brother...it was amazing in flavor and texture!!  I opted for a topping of sour cream and onions gastrique, which gave a nice cooling contrast to the red sauce .  We also had some refreshing citrus drinks along with chips and salsa.  The price is very fair and the food is good.  The staff is very nice.  Give this place a try...you won't go wrong :)"}
{"text":"So good! A bit pricy for 3 enchiladas but very very good taste! I would recommend anybody who loves Mexican enchiladas to come!"}
{"text":"Very nice people! Very patient. No attitudes here. Usually the flavor of an enchilada stems from the meat, the sauce and cheese, but the tortilla flavor stands out at Gadzooks which is delicious and memorable (50/50).  I also appreciate the honest service. I heard a server say to a patron in front of me that the red sauce by itself doesn't taste as good so it's better on the enchilada. Again, nice people. Worth the trip. Worth the wait. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely over rated by hipsters who don't know good Mexican food. First of all its pretty pricey. Unlike what people have rated it as. Second of all the portions are pretty small for the price. Third of all your food will be burnt. I actually gave them my \"enchiladas\" back because they were black. I wouldn't come back. This is my first place I've been to from yelp that hasn't been good. The only good thing was my beer and the guacamole and the people were friendly."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try this place, and I'm so glad I went! The food was excellent. I tried the 2 enchilada platter, one chicken and cornbread and the other green chile pork, both with green sauce and crema. 50/50 corn and flour tortillas, and both cheeses. The meat was very tender and flavorful and the corn gave it that tamale masa flavor. It's a fast casual concept, so the setup and dining area is pretty basic and they're not the most attractive/comfortable tables. Honestly if they did a little decorating and made it comfortable this place would get 5 stars."}
{"text":"I certainty like the concept, Modern, logical, centralized!  But it comes down to what us Latinos and Mexicans call \"Sazon\"!  Flavor, and the flavor of the sauces is just not there, at least not yet.  I tried the red and the green sauces and to me that  I been eating awesome enchiladas all my life, the taste is just to bland, not balanced, you get notes of spices but not put together in the right syntax! They should get a legitimate south Mexican Mom of Grandma to prepare them a couple of killer sauces and duplicate them.  Also the place could use some art pieces inside to make the decor intimate and it would draw even more people and it will duplicate the richness of the Mexican Culture, which they are trying to highlight through their food!  I like the entrepreneurial spirit of the owner that's responsible for the place!"}
{"text":"My oh my!!!!! This place is delicious!!! It's so good I got upset for not eating there any sooner!!! You design your own enchilada!!! I had the green chile pork enchilada and I was extremely pleased!!! I highly recommend Gadzooks.... GADELICIOUS!!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped here while in Phoenix for work and it was so good I came back the next day. It's basically a build your own enchiladas place. You pick everything from your tortilla type to all the fillings then they toss it in the oven so it gets all bubbly and delicious too it with whatever else you want and you are on your way. I highly recommend added the potatoes or the corn bread to whatever meat you choose for your enchiladas."}
{"text":"This place is great.  You taste every ingredient.  Each one is made on site.  Nothing is generic.  Loved the salsas.  Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Tried this for the 1st time today and it was delicious. i had 2 chicken enchiladas \"christmas style\". They also have sangria that is tasty for $5."}
{"text":"This place is my JAM!!    This is place is so different from anything else.  Sure, they make enchiladas and tacos but it's a whole different style than anything else I've ever had.  I like the salad or enchiladas.  I personally prefer short rib with cornbread filling because it gives it a tamale taste.  I know that sounds weird to get cornbread in a salad or enchilada but trust me, I'd eat my weight in that stuff.  It's super moist and extra spicy.    Everything is very fresh (including the handmade guacamole.  YES PLEASE!)  The staff is fast and are quick to make whatever changed you want to your meal.  You can sample all the meats before you order (and again, try the cornbread).  The owner is a great guy and I hope they build new locations soon.    The sitting area and parking get absolutely crazy during lunchtime, especially as word spreads of how good this place is, so be prepared to park somewhere else or try to hit it up later in the day."}
{"text":"Great, fast enchiladas. It feels like the enchilada version of Chipotle. But less corporate!"}
{"text":"Such an amazing concept! Really fresh food, great prices, and nice people. I'd highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were on our way home from Vegas, and we decided to stop in Phoenix for lunch. We intended to go to another restaurant, but I stopped when we drove by Gadzooks. I didn't even have this place bookmarked, but I remembered hearing about it in the New Times.  I'm glad we came after the lunch rush because I might have frozen up from all the choices. I went with the spinach/mushroom and potato enchiladas on the corn/flour tortillas and topped them with green sauce, pickled onions and guacamole. I like that they are broiled right in front of you so they're still piping hot at your table. The tangy green sauce was great, and I liked both fillings, especially the sinful potatoes. My husband got three different meat tacos; his favorite was the bison. The tortillas don't really hold up for tacos, though. His started falling apart after a few bites so he ended up eating them as enchiladas.   I'm more than ready to go back and try more of the options."}
{"text":"There is no wi-fi, but their vegetarian enchiladas are hot and delicious.  The employees are friendly."}
{"text":"I was so excited to finally try this place.   It is kind of like chipotle but for enchiladas where you get to pic what goes into you enchiladas.   Atmosphere and service was poorly amazing. Everyone was so friendly and helpful.   Even though we picked are own selections of items that went into our enchiladas, I was not impressed. It is for sure not my style. It was way too heavy. My enchiladas were soaked into a sauce and everything end up tasting the same.   I didn't feel good at all after eating my lunch. Same said my boyfriend, who loves food.   I would still recommend for people to try it. I am sure many of you would find it really good but for us it did not hit the spot.   We are spoiled with my boyfriend's mom making authentic Mexican enchiladas and that is the way we like them. For that reason perhaps, this place was bit overwhelming for us."}
{"text":"YUM YUM YUMMM. My first time in Phoenix this past week and we met a friend here that recommended this place for lunch. I'm so glad she did because we had to go back again once more before we headed back up to Seattle. When I come back, I'll be coming here FOR SURE!"}
{"text":"What's not to love? Amazing, fresh, unique food and friendly service. I loved the cornbread enchiladas with red sauce. Definitely go for the fried egg on top. YUM."}
{"text":"Love the soups, and don't cheat yourself, and not try the cornbread. The people who work here are always helpful in making decisions, the vibe is always laid back, and you are never rushed. I rocks wit you guys"}
{"text":"Meah. Food was ok. Great environment, tons of people. I got the bison tacos. I've only had bison a handful of times & it was gamy but not here, so that's a positive. I give them 5 stars for authenticity & making bison meat taste as good as it possibly could... But it's still bison meat. Really not that great.  If they have beef I will try that next time. I won't give up on this place for the simple fact that it's authentic with a Chipotle flare."}
{"text":"Service is rough. Went there today around 1pm with a coworker and there were only 3 people in line but we were in there 30 min (and our order was to go!). I didn't get anything because they were out if chicken, from what I overheard they run out certain food items often. Anyways, no one greeted us. We stood in front of two people making tortillas for 5 min and they didn't even acknowledge us. I understand if this is your role but one could at least smile and greet us.   When my coworker was trying to pay, a staff member opened the cash register to exchange their tip money and made us wait while they counted their tips before cashing us out.  Afterwards the cashier wrapped up my coworker's  food that had just been sitting there for a few min, meanwhile other staff continued to stand around and act like they hated their lives. They also kept asking my coworker \"is this your food?\" When you basically only serve enchiladas its hard to tell the plates apart, you think they would pay attention to whose food is whose."}
{"text":"Heard great things about this place, so chose to go there  for my birthday dinner.  The menu is sort of a \"build-your-own\" kind of thing, and fortunately we were the only ones there at the time, so we didn't feel rushed. The staff were friendly, but it was very difficult to hear what they were asking us. I had pork shoulder enchiladas, while my husband had the stuffed poblano peppers. Both dishes were tasty, but both were a little too spicy for us. We probably should have asked how spicy these dishes and sauces were when ordering. I tried the Sangria, prepared to be disappointed as I often am with other local establishments, but it was really good. Overall, we both thought Gadzooks was worthy of its name, and we will definitely be back. PS, the pumpkin spice cookies were amazing!!"}
{"text":"Fancy building! Oh, and the enchiladas were pretty nice too. So many options it was almost overwhelming for a newbie. Nice touch heating your finished product up in an open oven."}
{"text":"My friend showed me this place a few months ago and now we go almost every Wednesday it's so good! I usually get their nachos which are layered TWICE! Staff is friendly, clean spot, tasty food! Curious about the soup.."}
{"text":"Found this place by accident and so glad we did my daughter and I had a really great experience. Their concept is fun and food is delicious."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices, unique torillas, and get execution of concept!. I AM OFFICIALLY A FAN!"}
{"text":"Great customer service! A very friendly staff. Delicious enchiladas. I had the sweet & spicy cornbread enchilada with the red sauce, and the mashed potatoes enchilada also with red sauce. This spot will not disappoint."}
{"text":"I didn't know what to expect, went in with an open mind, and I was pleasantly surprised. The meats are cooked extremely well, you can choose what else you want with your dish, the staff are very patient and very informative, they really know what and how the items are executed. It is clean and a true great experience with a very reasonable price. A great place!! Definitely will come back...."}
{"text":"The enchiladas were AWESOME. However I had read some reviews that the portions were small for the price and that is correct. Basically after tax it is $7.50 for just 2 enchiladas and I would say it would take 3 enchiladas to be equal to a Chipotle burrito...maybe even 4. I just have a hard time spending $10-$11 for 2 enchiladas, chips and guac. So for me the food was really good but they need to make an order of enchiladas consist of 3 instead of 2 for the price they are charging."}
{"text":"I want it all. Give it to me NOW. It's the enchilada's version of Chipotle. I need one of these where I live."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food and great customer service! Redefining enchilada's indeed. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this place for a while and finally stopped in and I'm glad I did. The food was delicious and even as a big Chipotle fan there's so many options I feel like I could eat here multiple times a week and not get tired of it which sometimes happens for me at Chipotle. I gave 3 stars for 2 reasons. One -as a first timer its a little awkward to navigate their line. The menu is so high up on a portion that extends above your head so you have to repeatedly step back to complete your order. Also the staff was not very helpful considering they are a newer place and there's so many options. Even when I go to Chipotle or Texas Roadhouse or Grimaldi's the first thing they ask is something along the lines of have you been here before etc. I noticed the same treatment towards the other customers in line as well, maybe it was a bad shift but that definitely turned me off a little. I'll be back for hopefully an experience as good as the food."}
{"text":"My new favorite spot for quick mexican food! I have always had a hankerin' for enchiladas, and these WILL NOT DISAPPOINT. On my first go I got 1 each of chicken, short ribs, and a pork carnitas. Man they where good, not even good but exceptionally great. If you want a quality meal in under 5 minutes check this place out!  Try the pickled onions, might sound kinda gross but they work sooooo well IMO!"}
{"text":"First of all, I'm happy to see this corner coming to life!  There is a lot of development in this particular intersection which is great.  I've been skeptical of this place since I wasn't sure how an enchilada-bar concept would work.  I would HIGHLY recommend viewing the menu online before visiting.  The menu is posted very high up and you cannot see it when you are in the ordering line.  It's also very hard to hear the servers (likely due to bad acoustic dampening).  I think there should be some signs on the glass to help during the ordering process.  I did two enchiladas, flour/corn tortilla, both with the spare rib & asadero cheese.  I was really hoping to try the bison, but they only make enough to last until early afternoon.  I'm assuming because it's more costly to the restaurant and they don't want to serve it to the dinner rush crowd...booooo.  I had mine with red & green sauce.  Be sure to ask for the fried egg (extra $1 I believe), as they don't offer it to you when you're ordering.  I asked for house-made crema, slaw, cotija cheese, pico, and pickled onions.  Also ordered a side of chips & guac, and a cold Tecate :)  My meal was delicious.  The chips were house-made and fantastic.  The tortilla in the enchilada was amazing and the meat was perfect.    I will be going back and also bringing friends!  Recommendations to the restaurant would be to get a hold of the noise issue between the ordering line & servers, and perhaps add some signs on the glass to aid customers while ordering.  1 star off for the ordering process."}
{"text":"Highly recommend the 50/50 hand made tortillas with the enchiladas. Green salsa goes amazing with 2 fried eggs on top. Also the crema fresca and gota cheese. Great lunch spot or casual dinner"}
{"text":"Kind of the same experience three years later. I did not read my previous review and made some similiar mistakes. I added cole slaw for free which adds nothing and got half corn and half flour and did not try either the soup or cornbread. The end results through were still similar with chicken enchiladas with smoky red sauce covered in cheese. Two meals were about $20...not bad."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out because of how cool the actual building looks when you pass by... lol. I went with two friends for a girls luncheon and enjoyed the food! As most of the reviews state, the staff was less than pleasant. It was as if we annoyed them by being there. It took an act of Congress to get her to smile or even look like she enjoyed her job. Coming up to the counter was all business so know your order. The short rib choice was SUPER oily... one of my friends was sick for the rest of the day. But the Chicken and spicy cornbread mix was AWESOME!   I would recommend trying it because the food is good but if you are looking for great attitudes from the staff... skip it."}
{"text":"I really like the concept and variety of options and flavors. The food is delicious  I feel the portions are just too small to justify the value. If there were 3 enchiladas or tacos to an order like at chipotle, I would give it a 5 star."}
{"text":"Excellent options and flavors! I had one enchilada with the modelo braised bison and sweet and spicy corn bread filling, and I had another with the guajillo braised short ribs and the spicy corn bread. Chose christmas, both the red and green sauce, and both the asadero cheese and the chihuahua cheese. Chose the toasted arbol roja sauce, and scratch-made crema to top it off.  I think I had chosen way too many different flavors so I'm going to simplify it next time. But that just means that they put a lot of love into each filling and each topping.  And for about $8 it was really filling and I got to have not only braised bison but also braised short ribs, so not bad!  Edit: Finally made it back in and chose the half n half tortillas, cornbread filling for both of my enchiladas, asked for extra cheese, and topped it off with the crema and oh boy, I was in heaven. That will be my go to."}
{"text":"Yaaaaas.  This AZ establishment specializes in one of my favorite dishes: Enchiladas. Upon arrival the first option you are faced with is \"Choose It\" (2 Enchilada, 2 Tacos, Chopped Salad, Tortilla Soup, or Nachos). Ya gotta go with the 'lada. The next choice is picking your filling- I went with a mix of shredded chicken and cornbread. What an amazing combination of flavors! On top of that you get to pick your salsa and toppings. I went with the green salsa, sour cream, and guac. The slaw looked pretty tasty too!  Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Concept: Unique, in that it's just enchiladas and soups. Not a ton a variety of soups but you can add any topping you want in your soups, which were plenty. You choose the type of tortillas either corn or half and half. Then you choose the filling. I liked the beef and spinach and mushroom was really good too. I tried chicken as a sample which had a kick. Their salsa was OK. I also tried tortilla soup which was not just OK. It lacked the flavor and spice. It didn't have the wow factor. I wouldn't get it again. But enchiladas were pretty good specially cuz they made their own fresh tortillas. My son got a corn tortilla quesadilla and he liked it. I also tried a bite of his and it was different but good. In all good lunch value. I loved the corn bread with jalapeño. It was amazing. Definitely it's gonna be my spot for lunch."}
{"text":"Gadzooks is to enchiladas and street tacos what Chipotle is to burritos!   Ambiance: It has a similar industrial, minimalist design with a trademark orange accent color. There is a \"assembly line\" format to ordering, similar to Chipotle. I chose to street tacos over enchiladas, but they have the same basic ingredients.   Food: I ordered two street tacos with chicken, uncle rico's pico, asadero cheese, and guacamole (extra $1.60 charge). I skipped the red/green sauce, because I can only handle mild spiciness. (My friend ordered the habanero lava and said it was almost too spicy for her.) The food was very fresh and flavorful, and overall very delicious. Apparently they also sell soups, but since I had just come in from walking in the 110 degree heat, I passed.  Some cons: the ratio of indoor to outdoor seating is a little too low for my taste and during the lunch rush, it was difficult to find indoor seating. I also saw flies around the serving area and I even saw one land in the cheese. I know it's not always possible keep flies out of the kitchen, but still, it's not the most sanitary thing to look at.  Overall, I do recommend this place, despite the downsides."}
{"text":"I work within walking distance of this place so I'm glad I finally got to stop in and see what all the hype was about.   I only ended up getting the spicy corn chowder but I really enjoyed it. I like how the soup itself comes without meat so you're free to add in whatever protein or any other topping you want. I added the roasted chicken and it mixed perfectly. The perfect amount of spicy too.   Now that I've had the soup, I obviously have to go for the enchiladas next. Gonna go for that fried egg on top, too.   Overall, i think this is a really solid place to stop by and satisfy your craving for some goood Mexican food."}
{"text":"Just amazing. Service, concept, incredients. Awesome. It's like subway + local pizza joint + advanced Mexican cuisine."}
{"text":"Great food!!! This feels like the Chipotle of Enchiladas. I tried the pork and chicken with green sauce and loved them both. Not only is the food good but it is just something new and different.I would recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"I went again..sure its a tad salty, service is sketchy and its a bit warm in the seating area..  But i this time order  1 beef taco 1 chicken/pork combo enchilada with green sauce,  side of mashed potatoes   Was surprisingly good the second time around!"}
{"text":"Dank as hell   I'd smoke all the employees out with one huge joint the size of my head to show them how much I appreciate the food"}
{"text":"I'm giving 4 stars, generously, as they are still in the soft opening phase.   It's a new restaurant, so set your expectations appropriately.   Liked the people, very friendly, very helpful.  Liked the taste of the fillings of the Green Chile Pork enchilada and the Short Rib enchilada.  The home-made tortilla was a bit under-cooked...probably due to the thickness of it.  Liked the guacamole, and the chips.    They don't have their service flow down, so it took a long time to get through the line.  Not sure where the bottleneck occurred, however I'm optimistic they'll get the kinks worked out quickly.  After all, they've only been open a few days.  Price for 2 enchiladas, chips & guacamole, and a bottle of water was $13.    I will go back again in another week or so and see how it goes.  Also, just an excuse to try the Tortilla Soup and a couple other of the enchiladas."}
{"text":"I tried this place a few months ago with some coworkers and it was good. It wasn't something that I would crave often, but it was good to say the least. With it  being my first time, I did feel like it was overwhelming with the many options to choose from (plus it was around lunch). I ended up getting the 2 enchiladas with cornbread and chicken. I thought the cornbread was going to be weird, but it was good and different. I will try to go back soon to explore more options."}
{"text":"Super delicious food at a totally affordable price. As I always reiterate here, I love to support locally owned and operated restaurants. This is a perfect example of what a difference freshly prepared, imaginative food looks and tastes like. While it's not on the menu, be sure to ask for the award-winning chicken and cornbread taco. It's truly THE most delicious taco I've ever had. I hope there will be more Gadzooks popping up around town, soon!"}
{"text":"A super find.  All hours good takeaway.  A solid departure from routine mexican.  Don't plan on boar except early day as they run out fast.   Delicious-o-so!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what to say about this place that hasn't already been said but I'm hooked! Think of Chipotle but for enchiladas, and BETTER! As a vegetarian it's hard to find good restaurants with multiple meat free options, especially Mexican food. But they have 3 different vegetarian filling options and they are all DELICIOUS! I'm obsessed with the sweet and spicy cornbread and the tortillas are awesome. Decent prices and they sell beer! Idk how this place could get any petter."}
{"text":"For the price, creativity, customization, and the concept, this place deserves five stars. It is nearly impossible to find a place where one can have a gourmet-ish meal for $8.The best part is that everything, including their sour cream, is made on location.   Tacos remain my favorite. My favorite combination is baked tacos with corn tortillas, chicken/mushrooms, cheddar cheese, slaw, sour cream, and pickled onions. I love the fact that I can customize dishes and still not be rushed. The staff is exceptionally patient and helpful. They don't mind explaining everything step-by-step to anyone who looks even slightly lost.   I really hope that their business thrives and that they open more locations."}
{"text":"Great concepts.   The process is fairly fast considering the product they are delivering. We will back here over and over.  I would expect this to be franchised and everywhere fast."}
{"text":"first off, this is not a very healthy place to eat. now that that has been said, the workers here are just so great! they all greeted me and every customer in front of me. they were thorough in explaining the menu to me which i appreciated on my first visit. the food was quite delicious as well, altho definitely not healthy and quite heavy actually. i felt a major food coma after what i thought would be a somewhat healthy meal. i ordered my enchiladas without cheese and sauce on the side but their mashed potatoes had a lot of butter in them. also, the ambience of the place was quite comfortable for a fast food joint. it had a nice open view of the street and parking lot and brought in a lot of natural sunlight which i really liked. the only issued i had with the place was there was a girl worker there who shouted at everyone. maybe she was hard of hearing, but it really got on my nerves spending 30 minutes there trying to enjoy my meal when she was talking so uncontrollably loud. the manager was behind her at one point and never said a thing. the workers must have gotten used to her loud mouth. overall, i would come back here again."}
{"text":"Visited this place for the first time with my friend this past Friday. I loved it! I picked chiles instead of the home-made tortilla but they weren't ready, I had to wait about 10 minutes for my order. The young gentleman taking orders went out of his way to make sure my order was right. He even prepared it himself and delivered it to our table. Great job Eric! Customer service at its best!"}
{"text":"I'm usually not a fan on enchiladas, but this place surprised me. This spot is a DIY enchilada place with a solid selection of fillings, sauces and sides. Will def be stopping at this spot when in Phoenix!   Really wish there was a tortilla shell option."}
{"text":"sooooooooo goooooood!!!! One of the best restaurants in phx - it's my third time here this week!!! ADD A 'LADA!!!!!"}
{"text":"FAST AND YUMMY ENCHILADA HAVEN. It's a variety lovers paradise. Fun place to go. Crazy during lunch time- prepare to stand in line for a bit.  \"Beef, pork, chicken mmmmm\" Mulan anyone? Their fillings also include potatoes, and cheese. The spicy cornbread seems a little counterintuitive to put in the enchilada but man it's good!   So many yummy toppings. Make sure to get the Christmas sauce too. I love the ability to choose so many toppings- it's a variety lovers paradise. Jalapeno ranch is also a yum yum but it's spicy so I asked for a smaller portion on mine.  I haven't tried the soup, salad or tacos but if they were anything like the enchiladas they are a good bet.  Fun, and BUSY and crowded atmosphere, but it's worth it. Small parking lot. Worth checking out."}
{"text":"My friend and I really wanted to try Gadzooks.  So, we finally went last week for lunch.  It is a cute little place off of 7th street & Osborn.  The downside on this place is that the parking is really small.   The cool thing about this place is that they make your food right in front of you. Also it is like a chipotle, but they sell enchiladas.    I got two enchiladas, one with chicken and the other one with short ribs with red and green sauce.  They even put a fried egg on top of it.  OMG it was really good.  So, if you are looking for a place to go for quick and great food.  You should totally go here."}
{"text":"The food is not very fresh. The flavor is also not very consistent! Unfortunately- looks like I'll be skipping this restaurant for a while!"}
{"text":"Thanks for the expensive enema :( sad because we go here a lot & it's yummy...maybe a proper hand washing training session is in order. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Very cool concept! Chipotle style enchiladas, but with much more creative offerings. I came here for dinner tonight with my husband and I decided on the tortilla soup, and my husband ordered the enchiladas. I chose the short rib as an added option which was fantastic, very juicy and flavorful. The soup had a ton of vegetables and herbs in it and was quite filling. My husband went with a spicy cornbread stuffing enchilada, and a green chile pork with white cheese, red sauce, and sour cream. The cornbread had a similar flavor as a tamale, I couldn't stop stealing bites of this one. I really like how you can customize your order and there's plenty of options if you want to go dairy free or vegetarian. It was also very reasonable, dinner for 2 was $15! I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Another reviewer was accurate in saying that it is a complicated menu. After looking at it and waiting for service for awhile, we mentioned we were new and needed help and were told to spend time with the menu... Which we had already done for awhile. It is Chipotle style with various options. Please note, they have onions in ALL of their meats so if you are allergic or have a disposition against them, this is not the place for you. We went elsewhere."}
{"text":"Now that enchiladas have become my preferred regional dish, when I read about this place I knew I had to try it ASAP. Gadzooks has a very lively vibe about it, from the cool layout of the building to the enthusiasm of the staff. I tried two of their enchiladas: guajillo braised short ribs and sauteed spinach mushroom, with \"Christmas\" style sauces (red and green sauces), topped with asadero and chihuahua cheeses and a side of pico salsa. Both enchiladas were excellent, especially the short ribs one - so good I wish I got an extra one. And I could have (you could \"add a lada\" for 2 bucks more), but it turns out it's a good thing I didn't because I also ordered Linda's homemade tortilla soup - it was really tasty, and I had it topped with potatoes and crema. The soup was so hearty that it could be a light meal by itself; no wonder it was listed as a main dish and not a side. I would suggest to them, though, that they serve the soup in a bowl rather than in the tall cup that they use. I wish the folks here well and hope for their success. This is a very welcome addition to the central corridor of the city."}
{"text":"Really great authentic Phoenix dining! Definitely a millennial joint: from the music to the convenience and even the staff, all around awesome experience. Staff was super helpful and nice, and the food was phenomenal! Definitely a new favorite place!"}
{"text":"This a great place to eat for enchiladas or nachos. It is most like a fast food restaurant in that you pick out the ingredients you want then pay. On my visit on a Sunday afternoon the girl behind the counter fixing our dinner didn't seem like she liked her job. The tables were full of dirty plates and we couldn't find a clean table. You have to go back to the counter to tell them what you want for toppings, and that felt awkward. Even with all that, the food was good. I would go back if in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"First time visit and I Really enjoyed this place. Specialty beer, outdoor seating, fresh delicious food. I definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Two things,First  I will NEVER understand a restaurant when you tell them \"it's my first time here\" and it just flies by their head. Please, check back, \"did you like the food?\" \"Come back.\" \"Here is a sample of something you didn't try.\" Nada! Off my soapbox.  Ok, if your a Mexican food place the spicy thing on your menu should not be the potatoes. Food was very bland, mushy, and seemed to have been sitting there awhile. Comparisons to chipotle for ambiance are accurate.   I will go back in a few months to see if its gotten better, it's a great concept.   Side note: upon walking up, you are smacked in the face with the smell of fish. It's from a pond nearby, come mid summer it's going to STINK!"}
{"text":"Been meaning to try this place for a while now. So glad we finally did! Great food for a great price and so many options! You can mix up the fillings or get extra on the side for only a buck. The chicken was juicy and delicious. We will be back...and soon!"}
{"text":"First time here. Wonderful selection of freshly prepared meats, sauces and toppings. Loved the chicken with green sauce, Guam and picked onions. No issues with the service."}
{"text":"I had high expectations but was let down. Nothing wrong with the place or food but nothing to write home about. It seemed like a higher end Mexican place but the food was just \"ok\". The meat was cooked to mush. The flavor was a bit watered down. Salsas were really nothing special. I had Short Rib and pork enchiladas and a side of chips and salsa. The chips had WAY too much salt on them. Lots of big flakes that made my blood pressure rise. Salsa wasn't as good as most bottled sauces. So for 3 so-so enchiladas, bag of tortilla chips and an iced tea it was $19.....A+ for concept, C at best for food."}
{"text":"Pretty darn delicious! They make their tortillas and everything is delicious and fresh! I recommend trying the Christmas style, which is both sauces! So yummy!"}
{"text":"Mash potatoes in an enchilada! Yea it's freakin delicious. Love that they let you sample before committing which is always a plus! Lots of choices and the food was great. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Norm R. sent me an email back in May suggesting I check this place out. Since it's in my neighborhood, I'd been driving by and waiting for it to open.  I was able to get in the first time in June. We stopped in for a snack (my cousin had just arrived from NYC and was hungry - but we didn't want to eat too much, as we had dinner reservations in a few hours.)  We did a fair sampling of the menu. My cousin had enchiladas, I had tacos, and my sister had a salad. I honestly don't remember who had which protein in which dish - but between the three of us, we had a nice variety.  All of us were content with what we had, and none of us had a difficult time navigating the menu.  Everything was fresh and tasty. Not the most amazing food I've ever had - but it's quick, fresh and affordable. And I think it's a few steps above Chipotle in both flavor and personality.  I've been in a couple times since then, and have always been happy with my selection. The food always hits the spot.  Good stuff! Just hoping they expand to soups - plural. I'd like to see more than chicken tortilla offered."}
{"text":"This is the place all the enchilada lovers! I love how gooey the cheese and sauces were on top of the enchilada after being in the oven. Short rib & green chile pork were my 2 choices and I enjoyed both. I like this concept of building your own 'ladas & tacos, soups. I was very full with just 2 enchiladas. The place is small but there is also an outside patio that is dog friendly. Staff was helpful and patient too"}
{"text":"So my first impression was that this was a yuppie urban Chipotle's only more confusing since the menu was written over head instead of behind the servers which is ten times easier.  BUT, the beef short rib enchilada was SO good and the choices of toppings (cheeses, vegies, etc) were SO much better.  And they top it off by baking it in a cute little clay dish in the oven.  It was YUMMY!  The chips, however....much better at Chipotles.  I will definitely go back for lunch soon and try some of the other interesting dishes...probably not for dinner."}
{"text":"Affordable, high quality, and spicy Mexican food!  I consistently drive 30 minutes just to have fast, casual, quality Mexican food.  I can't say enough about the consistency and quality of the dishes.  I would recommend the pork and chicken enchiladas, tortilla soup and nachos!  The spiciest salsa option is SPICY so use with caution.  If you aren't into spice you can also opt for mild options as the food itself isn't inherently spicy - the sauce options are what add the heat.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Okay.. Generally I don't like enchiladas, but we decided to have an impromptu lunch date. The menu was very overwhelming for me, but Kaylin was super helpful & went through everything with us. The other girls who were working were also friendly making the experience a good one even before trying the food. The food was AWESOME!!! I ate every tasty bite of those enchiladas. I had one chicken, one pork & potato. Both very good covered in yummy cheese. Definitely will be back & bring the kids next time."}
{"text":"Chipotle meets enchiladas! What a great idea.  I was so excited to try this place and I'm glad Amy H convinced me to get out of the office for lunch! My food was pretty good, but I don't think I picked the right combination... and I definitely didn't pick the right salsa... it was smoking hot and I had poured all over my enchiladas which made the tops of them virtually inedibile.  I'm definitely going to go back and hope to upgrade it 4 stars with better combinations. Something to keep in mind, I am not a big eater, but I feel like the portions were really small. My giant would have been starving, and could easily eat a double order.  Maybe it was because I'm a vegetarian.... Also, if you go at lunch... parking is tricky!!"}
{"text":"PURE DELICIOUSNESS! It's like the chipotle of enchiladas but much much better! Everything I've tried has been pretty good. It's a fun atmosphere even though it's small. The oven is pretty cool, I think I want one in my house! Some things are pretty spicy in the menu so prepare for that. The cornbread is definitely one of my favorite menu choices, you can't beat it! Not too spicy either!"}
{"text":"This is the best place I've eaten at so far in Phoenix. This place has a lot of things going for it.  Fresh homemade ingredients Friendly Staff Good prices They serve booze  I don't know what else to say"}
{"text":"This is certainly not the first restaurant I've been to with a setup resembling Chipotle's illegitimate child (and likely won't be the last).  Though to be sure there's more than enough distinguishing features at Gadzooks to remind you that this restaurant isn't entirely a Chipotle copycat.  For one, enchiladas and soup are the primary emphasis here whereas the tacos and salads basically play second fiddle.  Based on my experience I'd say 4 stars is a pretty spot on critique of Aaron Pool's creation.  At least based on my initial experience.  I came here after work on a Thursday.  Great location with a modern design inside and out, easily visible on the southeast corner of Osborn & 7th Street, and plenty of parking.  There was no one in line when I arrived so my timing was perfect.  Though in anticipation of a line, I researched their menu online to I made sure to the get the ordering process right.  Today I went with a pair of enchiladas.  I chose corn tortillas for both, one with tomatillo chicken and the other with short ribs.  Topped with both red and green chile sauces, asadero cheese, and a side of cornbread.  From there, they put my creation in the oven to cook for about 1-2 minutes.  After it was bubbling hot, I topped them both with guacamole, pico de gallo, and crema.  And after seeing those tasty looking pumpkin cookies at the register, I decided to get two of those as well.  Total price for the two enchiladas, side of cornbread, and a pair of cookies came to about $12.  I decided to get it to go this time rather than dine in.  I would've taken a picture of the dish, but 10 minutes worth of ingredients sloshing around in my car made it look a little less than appetizing when I opened it at home.  Still, smelled great and I was plenty hungry.  The tortillas were decent, but perhaps just a tad dry.  The short rib and tomatillo chicken however, no problem there.  Super juicy delicious meats and plenty of it in each enchilada.  And the sauces, cheese, and other toppings were also spot on.  The cornbread was, unusual.  Super spicy (almost alarmingly so), but almost with a candied component as well.  I guess I didn't quite know what to make of this.  Not good or bad I guess, just different.  The pumpkin cookies were a fantastic way to finish the meal.  Super soft, warm, fresh, and just the right amount of frosting.  Seriously, when you see these at the register, just let it happen.  It'll be worth it.  So while Gadzooks didn't have too much in the way of an OMG factor, its a pretty cool concept and one that carves its own niche, even within the Chipotle niche.  The staff was super friendly with me (I think they appreciated that I wrote down my order in advance), and the price was pretty good for the amount of food I got.  Next time I'm here I'll probably try the soups and other items.  But I doubt I'll ever be able to leave the counter again without giving into more of those pumpkin cookies."}
{"text":"Such a great concept. Custom made enchiladas. The corn tortillas are fresh and you can tell. The pork shoulder and green Chile are fantastic for the meat choices. A little pricey if you get a third enchilada, but worth it in my opinion. Get there early and beat the lunch crowd. Small dining area compared to similar sized restaurants. But it is definitely a favorite spot. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I go often, more than I would like to admit. I also bring everyone I know here. You may be asking me why not 5 stars? Well the staff...ugh it's just so hit or miss. Last time I went was awful, one of the girls there seemed so annoyed at us and at her fellow employees. Just smile a little!  Things need to get a bit more efficient. There was 3 of us in our group. They started our order and had 2 in the oven when the girl started a phone in order of like 8 tacos or something. The 3rd was waiting for sauce and cheese while the others were cooking away. I waited for a few minutes and then politely asked if she could get the 3rd in the oven so they would be done about the same time. She rolled her eyes but did do it. Also they for got to bring out one of our margaritas. It just confuses me sometimes how they do things, I mean the employees are going back and forth and seem easily distracted. Please please figure this out, I mean you have something great here! The food is to die for!! If you could just get a little better system and all of your people friendly!"}
{"text":"This is a delightful place if you don't want chain style food.  There is a place for chain restaurants, but I like to find a place that can be whatever the owners want because it is an independent.  They have more control over what they buy so you hopefully you should be able to expect better quality for the food you meal is made from.  Gadzooks doesn't disappoint in this area.  I went in there this afternoon more to look to the menu than to eat.  All of us have had one of those weeks where you are tired but have just enough energy to do something you've been meaning to do for what seems forever.  That was my day.  When I got in there I found a very creative menu, almost more than I wanted to deal with.  With the people being s welcoming and the restaurant so clean I decided to go for it.  ruthfully, I let them recommend things and told them to use their judgement on them They had a lot of interesting choices to make from the tortillas to the cheeses to the condiments.  Once I sat down and ate, I guess I got some of my energy back because I started considering how I could have changed things from the many interesting ingredients that were available.  Next time, I will make it a real adventure to put together my meal.  Go and have fun here...definitely not your chain Mexican food.  II think it would be a great place to take a group and find out how many different combinations people could end up at the same table.  There is seating outside for people who enjoy that.  The cornbread tacos stood out for me!"}
{"text":"I cannot explain how pleased I was with this place. If I lived closer to this place I would have gone again the next day!!! They let me mix some of the fillings together, which I thought was very cool. I cannot stop talking about this place, and telling everyone that I meet about how great my experience was here. They flavors were spot on. I would say the only thing is, I had no idea what this place was or how it worked and it was kind of hard to understand what to do at first. There were 4 of us however and we all had different types of tacos and shared a bowl of soup. Not one of us had a complaint!! Everything was delicious!!! We will be back for sure! I hope you open more locations!! :)"}
{"text":"I mirror the sentiments of other people here. Food was excellent, the place is crowded and noisy when full. The service staff is less than helpful when it's your first time. The girl asked me what I wanted when I was 2nd from the window meaning I had to talk over the person in front of me. Awkward. Then she asked me what else I wanted when I had zero idea (other than the chalkboard menu) what anything looked like or what things meant... like 50/50 tortillas - that usually means 1 flour and 1 corn - here it literally means that each tortilla is half flour and half corn. Yes, this info is available on the chalkboard overhead, but help me help you by explaining it again as I go through the line... if it didn't have great food this place would be very disappointing...."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now. I've ordered the Short Rib, Green Chili Pork Shoulder and the Roasted Tomatillo Chicken. All very good but short rib is my fave.   They moved past the opening jitters but still single serve. Definitely faster than my first visit. Came on a Saturday at 1 PM once and it was as still packed. The word is getting out!  Give Gadzooks a try. Poor name but great enchiladas!"}
{"text":"Another fabulous find on Yelp! The tortilla soup is the best I've ever had and worth the drive all by itself. But- everything else looked so good that next time I'll have to skip the soup and get to the enchiladas. Don't skip this gem!"}
{"text":"Stopped by during lunch time on a Sunday and it was busy. First time ordering and I wish they had the menu in sight. I ordered a red enchilada with chicken. Didn't care for the red sauce, didn't care for the type of chili they use. I also ordered a taco of pork and that was good. The tortilla soup more like a stew was hardy,not bad"}
{"text":"Love the concept, something like an enchilada bar. I tried it twice with my boyfriend and both times were great. The server was super helpful, the environment was very laid back and most importantly, the food was amazing. I would definitely recommend trying the beef and cornbread :)"}
{"text":"Heard great things about this place but I was not impressed at all... had a chopped salad and it was so boring."}
{"text":"I ate there two days in a row! Two enchiladas with the flour tortillas and the works. I did love the cornbread and the chicken .  I did forget to mention that I was just visiting just for the weekend and it was my first time!  My hats off to this place for sure!  Colorado visitor J"}
{"text":"Very busy and tasty joint.  There are a ton of ways to make your customized enchiladas or street tacos.  Start easy on the toppings so you can find what your favorite combos are.   This place is packed but there's a reason why."}
{"text":"This place is totally amazing. They figured out how to make enchiladas not only fun and cool...but absolutely delicious. The meat selection is awesome...and the tortillas are incredible. Highly recommend. You will be back."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the ambiance of this restaurant. The staff was really friendly and helpful. The food was good but not five stars great. I'd definitely hit it up because its conveniently around the corner from me but, not sure I would interject in a conversation about HAVING to check this place out."}
{"text":"Gadzooks is a new taco joint in the Phoenix area, only their main staple is enchiladas not tacos. Sorta like Chipotle, but different. Overall, the good was pretty good but heavy for lunch. The issue this with Gadzooks is the choices, simply way too many of them. I counted a total of 7 distinct choices you need to make to get your enchilada, And halfway through the process, they pop it in the oven to heat. This maybe viewed as a positive by some, but not me. Why, takes too long to get your food!   Long story short, decent food but the long wait will keep me away."}
{"text":"Stopped in the other day for my second time. They are to enchiladas what Chipolte is trying to be to burritos.  But way better. A bit pricey but for two custom made enchiladas it is worth it.  I am amazed at how they keep all the orders straight especially in the oven.   Great job."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in the world. I'm talking about the best -- seriously, the very best -- enchiladas you will ever eat. Made just the way you like them. Smothered in good stuff, like wonderful pickled onions and some great cheeses. All of it is lip smacking good. And the idea for the place, the \"make your own\" kind of deal stolen from Subway, this is just really creative. Good job, congratulations to the owner. Someday I am going to stand out front with a big sign that says \"You will love this food. Try it\" because I think someone has to let the world know about the magnificence of Gadzooks. Read my reviews. I'm a very critical restaurant reviewer. I do not put up with slackers. This place rocks. [To the owner, my only suggestion is to put the \"ear lady\" in the back and not up front -- you'll attract more business.]"}
{"text":"Wasn't even looking for lunch but saw the sign when driving by that had {enchiladas and soup} on it....two of my favorite things...so if the hubs and I didn't stop we would hate ourselves later.  ********** Soooooooo Glad We Did *********  Walked in and here were probably 6 groups/tickets/parties of singles and multiples and the staff got them served lickity split! Kudos guys!  So it's a subway/chipotle style service which is amaze balls...but you know what?? It doesn't taste like it at ALL!!!!!! #winning :-)   So I went for the tacos and the hubs the red sauce enchiladas. Zero complaints or wishes to make it better. Oh also ordered chips/salsa/guac. First timer here, I refuse to live with regrets.   I don't think you could order anything bad or gross here. I will be back and getting lunch on work days and meals to go for the hubs for dinner.  It's just that good.  So why 4 stars? Customer service people. There were 3 guys and 2 ladies....Guys you were amazing and if it were just you, there would be 5 stars, you were on POINT...ladies you are the reason for 4 stars. Unfortunately you were both a bit rude to everyone in line and your facial expressions were even worse. Bad day? Fake it till you make it or get a different job.   //cheers//"}
{"text":"Ate here today for first time, food was very good. I had tortilla soup and chopped salad very fresh and delicious and gluten free. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant. Awesome! Great food, hot and fast service with a smile. Try the lava sauce!"}
{"text":"This is a very fun, creative, and healthy way to enjoy enchiladas.  While the setup does have a Chipotle-type feel, the ingredients are more unique.  I especially liked the oven element to warm your tasty enchilada.  My biggest complaint, there was not enough parking and seating was a challenge.  Notwithstanding, I will go back!"}
{"text":"Yum... just yum. Gadzooks is basically a chipotle for enchiladas, but on another level. I've been there twice and both times it's been delicious. Today, i tried the short rib and chicken enchiladas with 'xmas sauce' (both green and red) with a side of cornbread heaven. Absolutely recommended!"}
{"text":"I love it here! The food is always awesome. I would suggest this place to everyone. The corn bread filling is amazing."}
{"text":"The food is excellent !! Haven't tried there bison yet always never make it in time before they run out. Theres so many options on how to create your own unique dish and ingredients are always fresh. I would've gave 5 stars but the tables always seem to be dirty and I have to clean them myself pretty much ever time I have gone. Other than that no complaints."}
{"text":"GADZOOKS makes such flavorful enchiladas! It's always fresh, and the place is never not busy  (expect to stand in line for 15-20min during the 12 o'clock lunch rush).. I'm a big fan of eating/shopping local and GADZOOKS is one of my go-to places when I'm feeling like a heavier lunch."}
{"text":"Awesome. Awesome. Awesome. Several of us work nearby and just love this place and their amazing fresh made enchiladas. It's a really unique idea similar to how Chipotle works, but much better food. You saddle up to the counter and choose your fresh tortillas.  Next choose your main ingredient - pork, short rib, amazing corn bread, etc. then choose your sauces, cheese, and toppings after they oven fire it right in front if you!  Yummy!!!!"}
{"text":"It's all about the tortillas and the quality of ingredients. Flavor, flavor, flavor! We went at lunch at it was slammed with limited seating but well worth it. We had a salad, soups and chicken and pork enchiladas. They were all delicious and we can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I really appreciate it when a restaurant takes a simple concept and runs with it. There's no need to overcomplicate the menu if done right, and my friends, Gadzooks is a shining example of that.   The menu is straightforward, enchiladas and soup. Enchiladas are prepped Chipotle style, by which I mean, you go down a line adding fillings/toppings to customize your 'ladas. If you know how your taste buds work, you shouldn't have a problem putting together a winning combination! This is especially true because everything is tasty. I've had the pleasure of trying the chicken, spare rib, pork, and bison (only served at lunch), and all left me craving more. My two favorites are probably the bison and the chicken though. As far as other ingredients to add, there's a great variety. Fresh veggies, salsas, sauces, guacamole, and even housemade crema set a definitive line between eating here and eating at your favorite Mexican hole-in-the-wall. Oh, and wasn't there something about soups? Nope. Soup. Gadzooks has one, it's tortilla; it sits in a huge pot on the stove intensifying and enhancing its flavors as the day goes on. Add some chicken to it, top it with some cheese, and send me a compliment about it later. I personally can't say no to the stuff.  Gadzooks is one of my new favorite spots. With great service, consistent quality, and delicious food, this simple concept could be all over the valley in no time. I am very pleased to have it in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Food is great. I wish they'd throw in some rice and beans to fill out the meal.   I always get the green chile chicken enchiladas with habenero on top. They are quite delicious. There are also good vegetarian options available.   I also wish there was a good enchilada and soup combo meal.  It's more of a pick one entree either or kinda thing. I mean the name is enchiladas AND soup, not OR.    Also, the sneeze guard is awkwardly placed making it very difficult to hear the employees.  I guess I feel a little overly critical especially in light of the o so many positive reviews but  guess I can't help how I feel.   One more thing. TIP: make sure you get the sour cream on the side unless you want a big white pool of melted liquid sour cream engulfing your enchilada. The enchiladas are cooked in their plate leaving the plates very hot and they instantly transform a hearty clump of sour cream into liquid.  Update 7/29/2014: Seems as though they've worked out the kinks. There is still quite a bit of a lunch rush so If you are pressed for time it might not be the best place to go but otherwise it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"This place is really yummy! People keep writing it's 'like Chipotle'. The only thing like Chipotle is the set up. The food tastes about a billion times better. The menu is a little overwhelming for a first timer, but even with first timer choices the meal was fantastic. I got a cornbread enchilada and a spinach/mushroom with green sauce. The flavors are great. The line is pretty long at lunch, and they are not particularly quick. I was trying to figure out what the hold up was in line, and I'm not sure. Every one looks like they are moving at lightning speed yet the lines doesn't go very fast at all. If you haven't tried this place you really should. It's an interesting concept with great food. I'm excited to go back."}
{"text":"Tried this place yesterday.  Tried the short rib and spinach and mushroom.  So yummy!  Wish it would have had a little more sauce,  but it was very good.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Okay sorry folks I was not impressed we all ordered chopped salads which were soggy and underdressed can't say I will be back"}
{"text":"Super concept and oh so good.  Delicious tortillas and amazing fillings. Try the enchiladas. Los of cheese and toppings. Can't wait to bring others here"}
{"text":"Love this concept!  I think I could seriously eat enchiladas at least once a week and Gadzooks makes we want to eat them here.  The cornbread and potato enchiladas were amazing...unique options and super flavorful.  The staff was very friendly and helpful with recommendations, the patio was pet friendly and the prices are ridiculously reasonable.    They told me today that they won best chicken taco this weekend at the AZ Taco Festival, so you definitely want to check this place out!"}
{"text":"Comparing to Chipotle?  Sure, similar atmosphere.  Food?  Waaay better and truly delicious - after I had the enchiladas, I had to try the rib taco, which was awesome.  Value?  Some reviews say it's pricey, but these same people ought to call Chipotle pricey as well, since they are in the same ballpark.  Personally, I thought it was a good value, especially considering how tasty it was and some of the options available.  As far as service goes, I think they must have kicked into gear, because the counter people were friendly and helpful.  Every new business has its growing pains and maybe that is what a few reviewers experienced a few months ago, but I was personally very satisfied with this place, and glad I tried it.  Definitely will be returning soon.  Side note - to the person that said $1 for guacamole was too much - I hope you realize it's $1.80 extra at Chipotle, and try to make your own guac for cheaper...people do have to make some kind of profit, whatever measly amount they get from your $1."}
{"text":"Similar to Chipotle, but on a local Phoenix mom n pops level, and with enchiladas instead of burritos. I really like that it's local!  Pros: -Local -Simple decor with good ambiance -Fast friendly and helpful service behind the counter. -Plenty of choices to fill and and top your 'lada  Cons: -The menu is way above your head on the wall and hurts your neck to read it. -Maybe too many choices and somewhat confusing what to add and when to add it. -Food tastes decent,nothing special, not terrible but all kind of tastes the same. We had four ladas with four different meats, sauces, and toppings and couldn't really taste much difference between the four.  I would probably give this place another shot, but maybe try tacos and soup next time."}
{"text":"Will definitely be coming back!  I had the roasted tomatillo chicken enchiladas w/red sauce & my husband had the pork w/green sauce - we both added an over-easy egg on top of all our fixings - NO complaints here! So fresh! We even tried their cocktails, mimosa & grapefruit margarita - fresh, crisp & amazing!"}
{"text":"Good food but not worth the wait nor cold food. Been here once and I was not impressed w/ how inefficient the staff operated. The take out is served in a Aluminum container w/ wrapping paper and strings as a lid. Took about 30 minutes to get through the short line and by the time I got home my food was cold. Food was def over priced."}
{"text":"Food great, customer service sucks, they don't explaining how their system works, and to be honest it's confusing. They were rude and rolled their eyes like they had no patience. They need to smile and ask they the customer had they visited before!"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints! My husband and I love their enchiladas (try the cornbread one for something a little different and delicious). The soup is great and I can never leave without one of their pumpkin cookies (they are year around).   One bad thing: Can be very busy during lunch rush hour -- but well worth the wait if you have the time."}
{"text":"I think the food is very tasty and the restaurant is very unique.  The influence of the Chipotle chain is obvious.  I liked my meal, but I probably won't come back because it is too expensive for what you get.  There's just not enough filling in the enchiladas, or it needs to come with a side of rice and beans included.  I had no problem with service and parking.  If it weren't for the price and/or portion size, this would definitely be my new favorite restaurant!"}
{"text":"Love their food and set up, quality is quite impressive given that it has a chipotle style line up. Many options to customize your meal and been their several times just not too often as my heart can't take the deliciousness as you probably know why with any Mexican food."}
{"text":"Random stop here.  Delish and fresh.  I'd eat here everyday if it was an option.    My suggestion would be to read the menu ahead of time."}
{"text":"Everything Is good here. I get pork and chicken, with the 50/50 tortillas, red and green sauce, both cheeses, slaw, and the green chile vinaigrette. This place will soon explode like chipotle!!"}
{"text":"The green chile pork is amazing.  I would recommend the 50/50 tortilla and the green chile corn bread.  The cabbage slaw is super good too.  Only downfall is it's pretty small inside so if you head down for lunch during work, get there before 11:30 to avoid a line out the door."}
{"text":"Some of the best food I've had since we arrived. 100 times better than Caroline's, which has 4 stars. Everything here looks and tastes homemade, friendly service, and amazing choices. I just ate my leftovers two days after the original meal, and it might be even better! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing. If you are a whimp definitely go for the red enchilada sauce the green is a bit spicy. The meat is cooked to a perfect tender shred, the guacamole is excellent as are the chips. Tortillas are fresh and awesome, actually everything is! So glad I tried this place."}
{"text":"I finally took my first trip to Gadzooks and I will be back for sure! My sister recommended going early to avoid crowds, but I thought she was nuts because when we got there it was empty. By the time we left, the line was out the door! This place gets busy and the friendly, efficient staff is more than prepared to handle it.   We were greeted and the girl behind the counter explained the process to us - yes, just like Chipotle. Our pause was more just because there are so many choices! I went with 50/50 tortillas for my pork tacos, a little pico and sour cream and it was delicious. I wasn't hungry for a good 9 hours after that! Can't wait to try other varieties and of course, the enchiladas."}
{"text":"Good place. But their enchilada sauces are just to strong. I recommend get those on the side and add after as much as you need."}
{"text":"Excellent! Had the green chili pork enchiladas and was not disappointed ! Friendly staff, great atmosphere !"}
{"text":"Delicious enchiladas! I saw all the great reviews for this place and had to give it a try, glad I did! I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This place was an awesome lunch spot. Service was helpful, food was fresh, quality ingredients, and great selection of toppings. I had the tacos, Green Chile chicken and the Modelo braised bison and I can embarrassingly say they were gone within minutes! I'll be back to try more from their menu."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for lunch, it's only too bad there aren't more locations! 50/50 tortilla tacos for me, always add a third. One tomatillo chicken, one bison and one green Chile pork. Best. Lunch. Ever. Get the cheese melted over the tacos, side of the enchilada sauce, my mouth is watering just thinking about this."}
{"text":"Definitely a unique twist on the enchilada .... and a GOOD one at that.  We started with the Spicey Potato Corn Chowder and \"doc'd\" it up with some Guajillo Short Rib and a little jack and cheddar in a nice ceramic dish... to my surprise they put it in a little oven to finish of the soup... bam, deliciouso!!   My wife and split the two enchilada dish with the corn and flour tortilla mix (you can also get straight corn) ..one was roasted tomatillo Chicken and the other sweet and spicey cornbread.  Again we \"doc'd\" them. OTG up some delicious sauces (red and green) and a few more goodies... back in the oven and awesomeness. Great flavor and a great little place.   Will be back again!!"}
{"text":"Super tasty enchiladas! I tried pork and cornbread filled, full of flavor. Guac is good too."}
{"text":"As a veg my review may contrast others.  This place is a chipotle of enchiladas. Pick your tortilla filling(s) and toppings.  For the veg crowd there are 3 ish choices, spinach and mushrooms (good concept but need a bit more flavor and mushrooms), pepper jack potatoes and corn bread. I have only tried the former two to date. For sauce there is only 1 veg option the green. top it with some cheese, melt it and then some salsa and slaw. Looks great.  The down sides are 1. lines quickly form as the melting of the cheese becomes a bottle neck 2. The taste is nothing special the green sauce and the soft tortillas makes this remind me of an Amy's dish 3. I was still hungry afterwards  Give it a try and see if it is your thing, for me my ~7 can be spent elsewhere."}
{"text":"Gadzooks is the bomb. It's close to my work so I frequent regularly. They are the makers of my favorite Tortilla soup and it's very reasonably priced to boot. The only caveat to that is you have to eat it there. If you don't, you will get a container of soup that is about 1/3 of the portion size of the in house one. So not very cool (or filling) if you have to take a quick lunch and cant dine in. That is the only reason I didn't give Gadzooks 5 stars, they could definitely improve upon that. Otherwise, love the place and the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"AMAZING!  I went for lunch and got the 2 enchiladas.  One with green chili pork and the other with short rib.  Since I was a little overwhelmed with all the choices, and indecisive, I asked the person making it to top it with whatever went best, and that's just what he did.  I can't tell which one I liked better because they were both really good.  All I can tell you is, I will be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing enchiladas! Just wish it was a little less expensive. The short rib is my favorite filling!"}
{"text":"Stopped in at Gadzooks to see what an enchilada and soup place was all about.  Reminds me of a chipotle but with smaller portions and fresh made tortillas.  Everything I tried was great but there's were no condiments ( salt, pepper, hot sauces, eat.).   I found this a little strange for and enchilada shop.   If you heading there for lunch, get there early as it is a small place.  When I arrived there was one couple.   Within 15 minutes the parking lot was full and so was the establishment. If you get the chance I would defiantly check it out and decide for your self.  I for one will be back."}
{"text":"Great change to your regular lunch experience.... somewhat smaller enchiladas but loaded with flavor. Make sure to get a side of chips as the go perfect with the enchiladas!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love the food here! The tortilla soup is amazing as well as the corn bread. It's great, but I do have to say I think it's idiotic of them to charge an adult a dollar extra for a quesadilla that's the exactly same and a kids. I didn't ask for meat our anything special. My sister had asked for extra filling of cornbread in the enchilada, which the server.. then applied then scrapped off after. =_= some of the servers also seem to be mad sometimes, which is also bothersome. The only ones that have ever been nice is the blonde guy and the girl with gauges. I will be back with the hope that the guys make my enchiladas...."}
{"text":"Best new enchiladas anywhere in Arizona, period. You get a dish of deep, cheesy bubbly enchiladas made the way YOU like it, and it is an absolute treat. Wonderful!  Update: after coming here for more than a year, the food is still ALWAYS consistent and delicious. I tell all my friends to come here and no one has been disappointed! Don't be afraid of heat, here: even the hottest salsa, \"Habanero Lava\", provides an appropriate heat with a pinch of deep, toasty flavor that really adds great dimension to the dish. Get funky wit' it and be sure to mix the fillings! Add cheese with chicken and spinach, or try the short rib with the jack potatoes. Yum!! Just writing this makes me want to jump back in line and order more!"}
{"text":"Instantly became a repeat visitor to gadzooks after trying them the first time.  The homemade tortillas are awesome.  I crave this place all the time."}
{"text":"Food wasn't bad. Somewhat salty. The cashier was straight rude. I ordered Tortilla Soup when I got to the cashier and she annoyingly informed me that I should of ordered it at the beginning with my enchiladas. She then asked me what I want in my soup. I asked her what were my choices. She said that it was everything on the line. Again, she was rude and annoyed. I told her to forget it. I'll try it again but if they are rude again I probably won't go back"}
{"text":"Love the place.  Have been going at least once a week for the last two months.  Their enchiladas are amazing and the stuffed poblanos are out of this world.  Only downside is that they sometimes run out of the poblanos. I learned to call ahead and make sure they'd have them on hand and they always will. If you're a first timer it can be a little confusing but they're quick to help and explain.  Always a great experience!"}
{"text":"I saw a review that likened Gadzooks to Chipotle.  As I made it through the line and their staff assembled my lunch, I can see how that comparison can be made - in process alone.    I love that they have limited items on the menu (basically, enchilada, taco, tortilla soup) but then there's an option explosion for what you put in them.  I had a green chili pork enchilada and a bison enchilada.  Both were terrific. It was the best bison I've ever had, in fact.  The house-smashed guacamole was delicious also.  I thought I was smart by getting there at 11:30 (avoiding the noon rush) but they were already very busy.  I got the last parking space and the next to last interior table.  Thankfully the tables seemed to turn quickly and the line moved in the same way.  There are misters on the patio if that's your only course of action.     I will certainly come back and I'll bring friends."}
{"text":"YUM! It's like Chipotle's little brother. Great enchiladas and the soup is so filling it could be a meal on its own. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"This place has potential by the bucketfull. The front of house is really really cool, the menu is creative and well considered, the staff edgy but down to business. Talk about putting it on the walls! Just cool, in every regard.  Service was slow, not staffed well. Tables and floor, dirty. Flatware was empty, had to wait several minutes for a fork of all things.  Green chili pork enchiladas. Coleslaw, the habanero salsa. Coleslaw was the star of the show. Brilliant. Enchilada itself was middle of the road.  Braised short rib enchilada, red sauce, crema. Short rib was rich and tender, as it should be. The enchilada itself was left in the oven to long and the sauce was turned into a crust. I believe if it had been tended to correctly it would have been outstanding.  The staff was not friendly. Not a smile in the house. Like I said earlier, they were all business and nothing more. That having been said, when the rush was over they were cleaning straight away, which is good to see. What wasnt good to see was the skinny hipster guy coughing over his shoulder onto the serving station while he was sweeping.  Four stars for the great work done with the deco and the menu itself. I will stop by again earlier in the day and see if the concept is executed better when it isnt about time to close."}
{"text":"This place is overrated. It deserves two stars because they have a good atmosphere and idea but the food is not very flavorful. The tomatillo chicken was good and so were the chips but I would of rather had commercial tortillas than their fresh ones because it was not done correctly. The pork shoulder tasted like it was past it's use by date. I was really excited to try this place, but it disappointed with the lack of flavorful food, I might be willing to try the other location on camelback but the only thing I'd go back for at this location are the chips."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I was kind of concerned because my husband is Mexican and typically very critical of Mexican food but this place rocked our socks off! My husband got the tacos and I got the enchiladas - both we're amazing! Thankfully we did our research and checked yelp and google before we went so we knew what we were in for.   I'd say this place is busy- know what you want as you walk in. Check out the gadzooks website and write out your order before you go. It will take 2 minutes but it will prevent the deer in headlights look as you struggle to create your meal  I had enchiladas -with half and half tortillas- 1 chicken 1 pork - Christmas style (half green half red) - with jack cheese- green sauce- crema and cotija. (Yep! 2 types of cheese! Boom)   My husband had 2 tacos - half and half tortillas - 1 chicken 1 pork with chihuahua cheese (cheddar) the habanero salsa and slaw  This place is 30 minutes from our place but definitely worth it. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I just tried this place for the first time today after hearing my co-workers Rave about it. I have to say I agree. I got 3 tacos made with the flour and corn tortillas which are delicious. Fresh home made Tortillas are to-die-for! I had one with the corn bread stuffing filling which was recommended by a friend otherwise I may not have tried it. It was so delicious!  It is very tasty and a little spicy. I also tried the smashed potato filling which was more mild but still good. And the third taco was with the spinach and mushroom filling which was my least favorite. The spinach and mushroom was a little limp for my tastes. I topped them all with pico and guacamole and a mixture of their two cheeses. I had them top it all with the crema sauce and their gadzooks buttermilk sauce. So so good! I will definitely be back. A couple of suggestions for the owners though. The spinach and mushroom filling seems a little lacking and a little wilted. Also the largest soda available for purchase is only about 16 ounces which is not enough for us in Phoenix who are usually hot and thirsty and want a large ice cold beverage. Overall this place is great and very unique!"}
{"text":"This place has incredible food! it's an ingenious business concept that hopefully starts to branch out with more locations. If you're looking for an affordable, mouthwatering, and convenient meal this is the place to be!"}
{"text":"I have been waiting ever so patiently for Gadzooks to open. I felt like that chic in the Mervyn's commercial standing at the window, saying \"open, open, open.\" I drove by today and saw a parking lot FULL of cars. I quickly pulled over and ran to the door to snag a place in line.   It was totally worth the wait. They make the tortillas with fresh masa while you are in line, so it is totally fresh. The meat is incredible and the sauce is so flippin' delicious. I topped everything with pickled onions and a fried egg, my favorites.   I am a little apprehensive about this place opening though, because it is within walking distance to my house. I can feel my wallet crying already. I am going to be here often to try their other combos."}
{"text":"I'm surprised to see someone else noted in their review that they worked around people's allergies. I told them I was allergic to wheat (or gluten free) and they said they didn't have anything for me to eat. I'm not knocking them or anything, Just wanted to put that out there for others with a similar situation. Smelled good and looked clean, though. Love that neighborhood, too."}
{"text":"Gadzooks is a must-try spot in Midtown. They aren't afraid to add a little spice to their enchiladas and they use high-quality ingredients in every dish.   Get there before the lunch rush and owner Aaron Pool might treat you with a delicious and savory pumpkin cookie on the house.   This Chipotle-style process makes lunch quick and easy. Plus, you can add a fried egg to your dish for an extra surprise.   Gadzooks may have a silly name, but they take enchiladas seriously!"}
{"text":"I came here sort of on a whim the other night as it popped up in a yelp search with good reviews.  I walked in not really not knowing what to expect. Lucky for me the guy behind the counter was amazingly helpful and walked me through everything. Not only was I given a rundown of how things work but also a really vivid description of the flavor profiles. I was really impressed by how helpful and detailed he was. This wasn't your standard run down of well chose a meat, salsa and toppings it gave me guidance of how things paired.  Using this guidance I walked out with an order of 2 enchiladas (one pork and one chicken) and the corn chowder with beef. I topped it with a bunch of sauces including a cilantro cream that was really tasty. I also added the pickled onions that really added some punch to the dish. These enchiladas were great and so was the chowder. While it may not look like much it was a filling meal, glad I decided to pass on the 3rd enchilada.  Only complaint was the the beef was a bit on the salty side but that's just me.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Their chicken tortilla soup is nothing but the truth. I was sick and that's all I wanted and they SURPASSED my expectations. I will be back...you can count on that."}
{"text":"I think I was over sold on this place, and that set my expectations too high.  When we arrived an elderly man exiting the building told us this was the best Mexican food he has ever had. I LOVE Mexican food both Authentic and \"Authentic\" but I just did not get this place.   From their website: \"As I grew older and my tastes changed, I became unsatisfied with eating enchiladas that were the same color as construction cones and had the texture of a hot dog bun that had been dunked in water by a professional food eater.\"  I don't know where the owner was eating but that was never my experience at any decent Mexican restaurant.   The food was ok, and spicy but not in any kind of familiar way. It sort of reminded me of a TV dinner enchilada that had been churched up. My wife was not impressed as she thought it was too spicy, I thought it was not spicy enough. I'd love to tell you exactly what I had, but I just don't remember.  They definitely \"redefined the Enchilada\" but not in any way that I like."}
{"text":"Really, not great.  May have been because I got it to-go and I made 2 trips.  The flavors were good, but the enchilada was very soggy.  It was like soggy corn mash under too much guac and shredded pork.  It was a trendy concept that lost me along the way when I just wanted something good to eat.  I liked the sauce the put on top.  I also ordered the tortilla soup.  They gave it to me in a cup the size of a \"tall\" that you get from Starbucks that ended up costing me $5.50.  No tortilla chips on the side.  This wasn't \"The Most Amazing Tortilla Soup\" or anything.  Just regular tortilla soup.  I turned around and returned it because I was so angry for what I paid.  The Supervisor/Asst Mgr tried to say that tortilla was mashed up in the soup and that I have to request extra tortillas on the side.  I looked up the recipe, tortillas are not mashed up in the soup.  They give you a sizable portion, so if you think of the enchiladas as some sort of breaded shredded pork dish, it's tolerable the next day as a meal, but even then, there are a million places in Phoenix to get a great enchilada."}
{"text":"Tried the salad and 2 enchiladas. Was very good, thought it was good value for money. Ordering was a bit strange but I thought the servers tried to explain how to do it. It is a bit noisy inside though, if not, good experience and would recommend."}
{"text":"This place has the best enchiladas I've ever eaten. There's a red and green sauce that are both great- ask for Christmas to get them both. Don't forget to get a fried egg on top!"}
{"text":"I was surprised at how authentic the food was here! Very yummy, a lot of options to customize the perfect dinner. Add a fried egg for a buck!"}
{"text":"Loved it!!! My husband made a joke that I should never try new places hungry... boy I'm glad we did! Everything was sooooo good. My only 2 drawl backs were all the meat has some spice to it so the kids didn't care much for it. And the menu placement is odd, for a first timer I had to step back read, step forward and order... repeat. Highlights for me was the guacamole and pork! Next visit I'm having a grapefruit margarita! Now I'm super excited to the one opening closer to home!"}
{"text":"This place is so good highly recommend there sweet slaw is amazing the enchiladas have a ton of flavor reasonable price there is always a line but it's well worth it and fast service makes it move through quickly very friendly staff"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Great prices, great quality and delicious food. If only they had the 100 flavor soda fountain, it would be perfect.   So many choices and perfect size portion. Can't wait to come back and try other ingredients."}
{"text":"The hipsters behind this beautiful concept probably grimace every time the 'chipotle' comparison is made but it is a helpful reference point for the dining layman.  The concept is well executed and you'll be hard pressed to find a better meal at this price point.  My only complaint would be that they are excluding some of the better variations of enchiladas, namely Mole."}
{"text":"Dang it!! Came in Super Jacked to Love this place, saw Cory do a piece there on the News and it looked Awesome! Got there and was so disappointed....long lines which is expected for good food. But, NO VEGAN options- I checked the menu for my husband who eats Green for health reasons. It said there was a couple of options and then we are there- They aren't serving one dish so only one spinach option is available for him.  My nachos were good and I especially liked the corn bread that they serve- but it wasn't Amazing as it looked. Only 3 stars due to uninterested staff, and a establishment that had no clean tables to sit at- we had to bus a table to clear a spot in the place. It was more of a bummer cause I convinced my hubby to drive out of our way and then there wasn't any options for him. Probably won't return, there are so many options for this fare- nothing unique other than corn bread to brag about."}
{"text":"Great food and have good vegetarian options. Always busy  lots of great sauces to choose from"}
{"text":"The enchiladas are delicious. As others have said, it is best described as Chipotle for enchiladas. If you are not a fan of Chipotle (I am), understand that I mean it as a compliment, but I am describing the process rather than the food. I ordered three enchiladas to try all the meats. I liked them all, but the short rib was far and away the best. I added the red sauce, both cheeses, hot salsa, guacamole, and sour cream. I look forward to trying more of the toppings, but the ordering process is a little confusing, so I went with what I knew to get through without much delay."}
{"text":"Gadzooks Enchiladas & Soup           \"Just wasn't for me\"   Gadzooks is a create-it-yourself restaurant with a hip and trendy vibe. Gadzooks offers enchiladas, tacos, chopped salads and house made tortilla soup. The staff at Gaszooks is accommodating, friendly, personable, and knowledgeable about the products they provide.  The atmosphere is stylish but very cramped.   I guess I was really expecting more, considering all the positive reviews I read and this is why I feel terrible for saying the food at  Gadzooks was bland and poorly executed. On my first visit to Gadzooks I had the two enchiladas meal. First you select a bread. I choose corn tortillas,  Next it was time to select a meat. I  went with the braised short ribs. After you select your meat your ready to add the enchilada sauce. I choose the \"Christmas\" red and green,  two distinct sauces. Then your creation is topped with cheese, and  there are a few cheeses to choose from. I tried the Chihuahua Cheese. The medium size deep dish is then placed into a brick oven to bake. I added a few extras like Uncle Rico's pico and scratch made crema.   To be honest the food just wasn't good. The enchiladas were bland and soupy. Even tho Gadzoooks offers numerous toppings, I think less is better. The enchiladas seem to be covered with as much cheese and sauce as possible and this took away form the flavor of the meat.  Gadzooks wasn't the worst food nor the best, just disappointing.      However ending on a positive note I LOVED their chips."}
{"text":"Great service and food. I'm a NYker that moved to the Valley of the Sun less than a year ago and finding good food here is hard. I live in North Phx and everything here is chain restaurants or food badly made. I went in with low expectations but was pleasantly surprise by their staff, food choices, prices and great service. I have visited this place three times already and am planning to become a regular."}
{"text":"Never disappointed. Such a unique and interesting variety of flavors. Built exactly to your liking. If you don't leave here full and happy it's your own fault. So good. In addition to enchiladas, tried the spicy potato corn chowder for the first time. Outstanding!  I come back every time I get the chance."}
{"text":"I love coming here.  The food is fresh and good and you can get in and out in 20 minutes (usually......not at lunch though, it is packed).  My favorite is the enchilada stuffed with a corn bread........it is so friggin good.  The guacamole is excellent and I usually hit this place up at least once a week."}
{"text":"This place is brilliant!   Screw chipotle! I order enchiladas at a Mexican restaurant anyway, so why not custom make them, in an assembly line fashion?   Delicious, vegetarian options, has beer, and something for just about anyone!"}
{"text":"Very good food, nice atmosphere, a little pricey but ok.  I really liked the White sauce, but thought the Red sauce was a little too smokey flavored for me.  Employees were nice. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"After my initial experience here, the most immediate question in my mind is how well capitalized are their investors?  To the uninitiated Gadzooks appears to have been created to be as much a Chipotlé spinoff as possible.  From the hip, industrial design of the interior to the simplified menu options.  They've also borrowed Chipotlé's basic \"build your own\"  menu format.  Except rather than burritos - it's enchiladas... And as an afterthought soup.    While Chipotlé's menu is easy and intuitive, Gadzooks offers a 7 step choose your own adventure book accessed only by reading the most awkwardly placed chalkboard in restaurantdom.   The enchilada was bland.  The service seemed to be working awfully hard for so few guests.  The atmosphere was stylish but cramped.    I think these guys set out with a good idea, let's hope they have the capital to fix their fundamentals and get back on track."}
{"text":"Not the typical Mexican restaurant/food. Fresh ingredient for the more healthier minded person."}
{"text":"I had here what I think, in my humble opinion, was the most authentic and delicious gourmet enchilada plate I've had in my life. I grew up in Mexico and tried the lot. I've had from curb-side to high-end restaurants. This was quite a treat and this place takes the gold.  For a quick bite to eat I always resorted to stop at chipotles which was my favorite, until now. This place elevates Mexican food to a whole new level. The place has a similar feeling to chipotles, very rustic.  You can see the pots and pans being used to cook delicious meats that probably had been simmering all morning before opening. All the ingredients are fresh and they taste fresh. Crema from scratch? When a business is taking their time to make something as basic as crema fresca from scratch, you know you will not to be disappointed.  Enough with the talk. I encourage you to give this place a go. I know they have tacos and salads but they are a dime a dozen in this city. Not saying by this they are not as good, but good enchiladas are hard to find."}
{"text":"Booooooommmbbbbb!!!!!! Almost the same idea as chipotle being an American \"Mexican\" restaurant!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I've been here twice and was surprised both times at how much meat they give you. The short ribs are excellent and the guacamole is perfect.   My only problem with this place is the girl behind the counter who talks way too loud. She's been there both times I've come for lunch. I get that it's noisy back there, but no one else behind the counter talks nearly as loud as she does and I hear them fine. I'm not letting this affect their rating though, since the food is worth it."}
{"text":"I really can't think of a bad thing to say about this place. I went with my parents and boyfriend as a sort of late birthday lunch. None of us had been here before, but we wanted something fast and casual, but still good quality. Well, that is exactly what we got.   As many others have stated, it's cafeteria style ordering. We all went for the enchiladas, but you can order tacos, salads, and soups as well. There were also a couple specials, including Modelo braised bison available till they ran out. We had our choice of corn tortilla or a 50/50 corn/flour combo. You then choose your filling, or a combination of fillings. I had green chili pork and the short rib, but there was also chicken, as well as potatos, spinach, and corn bread filling as vegetarian options, or to combine with your meat. I chose the cheddar cheese and Christmas sauce for both enchiladas. I also got a fried egg on top. After the enchiladas are baked, you can choose from other toppings such as pickled onions, pico, cotija, and other sauces and salsas. I kept it pretty simple and just got cotija and a side of salsa verde.   I ordered the Oro to drink, which is their house margarita. I honestly wasn't expecting much, as it came from a pitcher in the cooler, but it was actually really tasty. My mom got a ton of different hot sauce and salsa on the side. I was really happy with the spice level of everything. Even without extra sauce the enchiladas had a nice kick. The meat inside the enchiladas was tender and flavorful, and not fatty or too greasy at all. It was a perfect portion of food for lunch time, and we all really enjoyed everything.   Although we came just after noon (in the middle of their busy lunch rush) service was prompt and friendly. There was also ample seating, we found a spot easily and did not feel over crowded.   I'm glad we finally tried this spot out, I definitely would like to return and try other combinations on their menu."}
{"text":"All I can say is \"WOWEEEEWOW!!!!! \(^_^)/  This place is set up like Chipotle, but that's where the similarity ends.  All items can be doctored up as much as you want with their delectable add-ones.  I opted for the tortilla soup option with 50/50 shredded beef/shredded chicken and added slaw, pickled onions and a little scoop of cornbread (don't question it just get it) plus a bag o' chips and salsa.  It was literally a party in my mouth with every bite.  Every employee I interacted with was pleasant and more than happy to help me figure out what to get since it was my first visit.  I will definitely be back during lunch for their specials!"}
{"text":"They needed an extra employee or two. Dishes piled up on almost all tables. No silverware, and dirty tables and silverware holders. Recommend moving to plastic utensils and hiring a full time bus boy during peak hours!  Enchiladas were okay, but the short ribs were too spicy, overpowering. Took away from my overall enjoyment of their dishes. Otherwise  novel, yet Chipotle-like take on Mexican enchiladas and tacos. Half corn half flour was a  first for me tortilla-wise  It takes too long to order and prepare food here. I can actually get a Blaze pizza faster than this place makes my dish, and even then I haven't finished putting toppings on it. The assembly line needs modification somehow  Finally, the way the menu is laid out is preposterous. Unless you've been there before it's hard to read, and seems to be designed to 'read as you go's from station to station. They need digital menus here, visible to customers waiting in line, so you can know what and how to order before talking to a person  I'd try it again, this time chicken and no red sauce"}
{"text":"Wife and I took the kids to lunch. Fantastic food at decent price. Three enchiladas, each different meat. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious!  I went at lunchtime and had a chicken tomatillo enchilada and a green chile pork enchilada with corn tortillas, green sauce and habanero salsa, and a side of chips and guac.  I was a newbie and overwhelmed with all of the choices, so next time might load it up a bit more!  The food was very flavorful.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, the Enchiladas are very good, but the menu item I will dream about is called Linda's Homemade tortilla soup.  Now as some may know, I am a soup lover.  This soup is more like a spicy chicken soup, although I think you can choose any meat to add that's on the menu.  Topped off with a bit of Jack cheese and crema and you have yourself quite a meal for $3.95.  Be advised, they get busy for lunch and you may wait awhile.  Service has always been friendly as expected."}
{"text":"So good!  I resisted going here for a long time (I don't like enchiladas or soup) but finally was convinced my husband to try it---it was great! It's kind of like chipotle but so much better, and it's not just enchiladas and soup. I love their chopped salad with short rib. My husband tried enchiladas and loved them as well. Service is fast & friendly, so much so that we stopped here (second visit) for a turbo lunch on my way to catch a flight for which I was already cutting in close. They sell beer even during lunch.  Convenient location. Will go back"}
{"text":"I walked up and was like \"wow! This place has a patio!\" And let me tell you how dope that patio is! It's got like 7 tables! And you can sit at any one of them! Unbelievable. I'll be coming back to check out that dope patio for sure!"}
{"text":"Mmmm. Enchiladas have always been one of my favorite foods, and there's a Phoenix eatery solely devoted to cheese-filled tortilla bites of heaven: Gadzooks.  For those of us who always dreamed of an enchilada bar, Gadzooks makes those reveries come true. The spot serves up just about any type of enchilada you'd like, as well as quesadillas, soup, tacos and salad. The tortillas are freshly made, and the combinations are endless.  Fillings include chicken, pork, potato, bison, mushroom, short ribs and two types of cheese ($6.50-$6.75 for two tacos or two enchiladas), and then you get to douse your order in salsa, sauce, slaw and more. You can order three, but two were plenty for me, and I left with a full, happy stomach.  The joint is order at-the-counter with a patio, and it's a really great alternative to Chipotle if you're looking for some new fast Mexican food. They also serve sangria, margaritas and beer."}
{"text":"For starters...WOW! I had heard great things about Gadzooks and been wanting to try it and decided I would make today the day I stopped in for lunch. They are set up a bit like Chipotle (how you order) but I don't care for Chipotle's food.... I had looked at the menu before going so I could think about what I was going to have before getting there. I decided to have two tacos. I choose the 1/2 & 1/2 tortillas (AMAZING) and one with the green chili pork shoulder and the other modelo braised bison, jack cheese (toasted) then I put on Pico, salsa verde, crema, honey slaw and jalapeno ranch. My first bite was the pork and I thought I had died and gone to heaven! The flavors were so good and everything was extremely fresh! The portion size was perfect as well. I cannot wait to go back and try more options as they are endless."}
{"text":"Best enchiladas ever. It's a chipotle style restaurant where you pick what you want on your enchiladas as you go. They give multiple options for enchilada fillings with the corn bread being our favorite. Putting a freshly cooked egg on top is a must. Extremely delicious and unique experience. If you are in the area, go check it out."}
{"text":"Uh oh. I'm in trouble. I work a mile from this place and I can tell from my first visit, I'm going to be in trouble. My coworker and I stopped in and told the guy making our food it was our first visit. He couldn't have been friendlier. He gave us suggestions and tips on what to get. We ended up with two chicken and cornbread tacos on 50/50 and nachos with chicken and Modelo braised Bison. Everything had so much flavor. And, I'm stuffed. Can't wait to go back to try everything else. YUM!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place. Excellent cuisine. A lot of options to choose from. Fast and tasty. My only problem is that this is not a ton of food at a price. But in general it is excellent."}
{"text":"To me this is like Chipotle but for enchiladas. So tasty!!! You just go for it, get creative and then enjoy. My only star deduction is from the often crabby staff, specially if you come during lunch time."}
{"text":"Love me some Gadzooks! Favorite enchiladas are the braised short rib enchiladas. I usually get the short ribs on the green chili pork. Toppings are all fantastic as well from the coleslaw to the all the cheeses.   Pumpkin cookies are awesome as well. Great place if your looking to stay on a budget but still enjoy quality food."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. The line was rather long for lunch but they got through everybody quickly and expedited in the request that I have. The location is a little tough to get to but it's totally worth the parking fight for delicious food. It's worth the parking lot fight!"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time today. The shredded beef enchiladas were out of this world!  Probably the best I've had. Their ingredients are very fresh and they also have salads, tacos. Prices comparable to Chipotle but food is much better. Will definitely go there again with family this time."}
{"text":"Tried Gadzooks today at the end of the lunch rush. I think that young retauranteur Aaron Pool will have one of 7th Street's most booming places if he is able to work out the kinks.   The enchiladas were impressive. I would have praised them in a full sit-down restaurant and was surprised at the quality and flavor considering Gadzooks is a \"fast casual\" kind of spot. I can't comment on every element of my dish because I ordered in such a frantic manner. I do know that I had chicken and short rib enchiladas smothered in tasty, tangy sauce and cheese. Every bite and flavor was delicious.   The parts of the experience that were really lacking were service and signage. Though the employees were friendly, their knowledge of the product was minimal and sense of urgency was nonexistent. Just having the individual fillings, cheeses, toppings, etc. labeled would have cut down on a lot of the confusion. There is a chalkboard menu above the area where you order, but you cannot even read it unless you are standing five feet away. Places like Subway and Chipotle have had the same ten ingredients forever and people still have to hem and haw over their order.   I'm by no means suggesting that Gadzooks should go the Subway/Chipotle route. On the contrary. They boast the thousands of flavor combinations available, and that is much appreciated. Yet in order to follow through on that promise, they need to have a precise ordering process with staff that is knowledgeable about every ingredient and can convey that information quickly and effectively.   I'd like to see this place thrive, and I do absolutely recommend it. They've tackled the number one priority- good, quality food that is reasonably priced. Now they just have to work on the rest of it because a stressful ordering experience is enough to put people off the food altogether."}
{"text":"Finally moved to Central and Indian School...had Gadzooks for dinner my first night. So glad I'm in the area now, it's the only reason I moved here was to be closer to my enchiladas."}
{"text":"The enchiladas are great!  Read a few reviews and decided to try them today. They make the enchiladas right in front of you in a pizza type oven. Soo good!  Also had a sangria which was also very good. We ordered the soup just to see and weren't impressed - the veg in it felt like it had been in a crockpot for days. Everything else was amazing tho and will definitely be back"}
{"text":"So disappointed since it's in my neighborhood. Interesting format but sloppy and disorganized assembly line. All the meats were super spicy, which paired with salsa, was way too hot. The tortilla soup remnants we had had NO TORTILLA, if there's no tortilla, its not tortilla soup! /end. The cookies were the highlight of the meal.  Now, they also have HORRENDOUS customer service! First off, no ice. I am so irritated that I will not come back again and will tell anyone who will listen how rude the blond cashier was. My sister had accidentally spilled our soup all over her hands and on the floor. No big deal, but not a single napkin in sight. When we asked for some, she returned with a wad of brown paper towels and then completely ignored us. Not a single staff member offered to replace our spilled soups or came to clean it up, just kept moving along as if they expected us to clean up the soup ourselves. I hate to think that it was a race thing, but their behavior was completely suspect. The manager came up to her to ask what happened, nodded, then returned to the assembly line. When I asked for a drink, she said there's no ice. But when she rung up this lovely young white couple, she said that they were making more and would bring it to them. WTF, I guess they don't want us black folks eating there.  P.S. This place doesn't hold a candle next to Barrio Cafe or Richardson's, what a joke."}
{"text":"Stopped by yesterday for some carry out to heat up later. Have to say the short ribs were amazing, the chicken was great, and the pork just OK. Topped Christmas style b/c the Hub prefers red sauce to my green - but this time we both switched teams. I found the red to be smooth, smokey, and complex - while the green was grainy and piquant with less kick than advertised - but he loved it. Liked the combo corn/flour tortilla the kid behind the counter recommended. Have to say at 4:30, the product in line pans were looking a little tired. Be nice if they were scraped down and cleaned up. Felt like it was lunch leftovers before the night rush. Which, at the proper temp is NP, it's just a mental/marketing thing...  Hey did anyone notice SOUP? Totally missed it in the 'experience'. Next time."}
{"text":"I'm a pretty big fan of this place.  Yes the ordering can be a little time consuming, but when you consider that by the time you reach the end of the line, you are handed over a freshly baked casserole chocked full of yummy goodness, it sort of makes up for it all.  So there are a few things you should know when ordering.  1) You can get nachos.  They're not on the board, but they will make them up and they are delish (and big).  2) The soup is awesome.  I wish they offered more than one size but it is tasty and built to your tastes, just like everything else.  3) The spicy cornbread filling should be nominated for its own food group.  This is seriously the best thing that I have tasted in a really long time.  4) The grapefruit margarita is fantastic.  Perfectly crisp and refreshing for our super-hot summer days, do yourself a favor and get one or two (or three).  5) The pumpkin cookies with touch of caramel frosting is a must have.  It is the optimal ending for the meal and since it's not heavy, it's a great topper.  The staff is friendly.  The space is clean.  The food is fantastic.  Yep, I'm a pretty big fan!"}
{"text":"I think I have found a new favorite spot.   I had the roasted tomatillo tacos with a goat cheese shmear on the bottom, pico, guacamole cheddar cheese and a fried egg on top.   The first bite had the chicken and salsa and a bit of egg. Then I hit the jackpot with my second bite and was pleasantly surprised with the goat cheese and their guacamole. Each bite had a great mixture and these are tacos best eaten with silverware.   Their green chili pork looks very good as does they smashed potatoes which I will try on my next visit.  Staff was very friendly and once they knew it was my first visit they took the time to explain the process.   They also sell pumpkin cookies which are very similar to the ones my mom used to make. I may be biased but my mom's are better. Just a little more flavor than the ones I bought here.   All in all some hearty southwestern food that did not disappoint.   I will be back and anxious to try the green chili pork and smashed potatoes!"}
{"text":"Very hot and spicy salsas and sauce. Get it it on the side add to taste/tolerance.   Can be noisy.   Overall - very good!"}
{"text":"Arrgh, just when I kicked my Chipotle habit, this place comes along.  Some great tortilla soup, custom made enchiladas that come out of the oven piping hot.  Why didn't some one come up with this earlier?  My biggest gripe is the parking lot, not the easiest to negotiate a little parking lot on 7th street during prime rush hour but worth it.  Oh they have great snickerdoodle and Mexican wedding cookies for purchase right at the counter!"}
{"text":"I love this place - enchiladas, soup and salads. The best filling is cornbread - even if you aren't a vegetarian it is worth it."}
{"text":"Have your enchiladas your way custom made to order! I love it here, you choose what you want and how much you want. This place makes enchiladas is a Chipotle like fashion where you point and add the topping you desire. You can have anything from mild to wild! The drinks are great too! The only bad part is the parking situation but that's also the part of the charm to this place also."}
{"text":"Wow, amazing food.  Tell them what you want and that's what you get. The Enchiladas are put together to your taste and the lava was for real.    Parking lot is too small and seating is a bit on top of eachother, so come early or take a late lunch."}
{"text":"I found a new favorite spot.   The service was great, letting me sample things before committing to anything, and above all, friendly.  The prices are amazing, especially the soup. It's been awhile since I've felt completely stuffed after spending just $4.50 anywhere that isn't fast food.   And most importantly, the taste. Muy bueno. Or should I say, \"Gadzooks, that's good!\"  I'll most definitely be going back."}
{"text":"They had me at buffalo enchiladas with Christmas sauce.  Their salsa is spicy and delicious!  Their handmade tortillas are very good."}
{"text":"I have to say this place is not what other YELPERS claim it to be. Definitely OVERRATED..!! Let me start off by saying this \"Mexican\" restaurant isn't Mexican whatsoever. I ordered my son a quesadilla aka cheese crisp & the flour tortilla was so thick and I'm assuming the batter had too much butter. Not sure how you can mess up a quesadilla. I myself ordered two enchiladas one four with chicken & the other corn with pork with green sauce. My first bite I thought yum as I continued to eat my meal I realized that the shredded chicken had similar texture to rubber meaning it was over cooked. I did not take another bite. I thought the pork was ehh ok. Later on that day my stomach began to hurt. I later felt nauseous'. I will never return here. Great restaurant concept but not what you expect it to be. Definitely a hipster spot. I almost forgot to add.... I always wipe down table before I help my son cut up food and let me say that the tables at this restaurant are filthy. The wipe was full of dirt. Made a dirt finger print on wipe. NASTY.!"}
{"text":"So delicious!!! I drive by them all the time and finally gave it a try and now I'm obsessed  i used to frequent chipotle until they went downhill and this is my new favorite spot for yummy fast Mexican food! I've eaten here 2 days in a row and am still craving their short rib enchiladas. YUMMMM"}
{"text":"I first tried the festival taco at Lost Lake festival and fell in love! I've been here 3 times after and still love it so much. The problem is everytime I come I feel as though the workers aren't very friendly, they aren't rude, just not very inviting. I ask for the festival taco and they continue to ask me what I want on it which confuses me because I want it just how it comes, I don't know exactly what's on it so how am I supposed to know? They don't speak loudly and I can't hear them. all in all food is always good, but the customer service just stresses me out. Make it how it comes and ask if I want to add anything extra, not ask if I want what's already on it. It's not just one specific worker it's ALL of them, just would rather have friendly workers who want to help, not feel like they have to."}
{"text":"A solid four star lunch. I knocked out their pork enchiladas that had their red and green sauce with a tasty egg on top. I went with their medium salsa which was good. The flavors were nice but in my opinion battled each other. For dessert, I had their pumpkin cookies and they were awesome. Overall, the food was good and I would recommend them over chipotle any day."}
{"text":"Take Chipotle and, cross it with wood-fired pizza minus the pizza, add your own personal twist then throw in some out of the ordinary choices (bison tacos, anyone?) and voila, Gadzooks.  You get to choose from soup, tacos or enchiladas and pick out your choice of meats and cheeses. After they stick it in the oven to get it all melty and toasty you add on veggies and our salas, perhaps grab and beer and your done.  I came not too long after it opened and it took a while to get my order in. A lot of that had to do with that fact that none of us really knew what our choices were. The menus aren't that clear so I found  myself guessing up to the last minute before making a rush decision as to not hold up the line any more.   It was a little haphazard behind the counter as well because the staff didn't quite seem to know what was going on or what they were supposed to do. It was like a poor assembly line that went horribly slow to suddenly speed up. It was like watching Lucy and Ethel make enchiladas.  Once i got my order though the meat was tender and delicious and I really enjoyed it. I would probably go just a little less melty next time. I think I need to go a few more times and become more acquainted with the menu I'm sure I'll like it even more. I'm sure too that by now that staff are more experienced and running like a well-oiled machine."}
{"text":"Not your usual enchiladas. Love their festival tacos!  One bite and it's like a fiesta in your mouth! They have such unique fillings for enchiladas and tacos!  Their guacamole and chips are delicious. They fry their own chips- wish they gave you a bigger serving of guac tho.  You have to try this place- it's unique and tasty."}
{"text":"Solid 4 star restaurant. They've never let me down, consistently good and I love the variety of toppings. I'm normally not even a fan of enchiladas, but these ain't your grandma's enchiladas. Every meat they have is good, and they even have vegetarians options of potatoes and cornbread as your filling if you're into that sorta thing. The cornbread is hands down the best cornbread I've had so I get a side of it every time I go in. You can't go wrong with any of the meats, they're all good. I can't even recommend one over another because I switch it up every time and enjoy it every time. Definitely a good spot to go and enjoy lunch any day of the week! My friends love the cookies they have so give those a try, I don't happen to like them, too sweet for me, but everybody else I know likes them! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Heard about this place and how good the food was. I ordered tacos and got what looked like enchiladas soaked in sauce which made the whole dish mushy. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Excellent overall! Except for the Hispanic cashier she needs to cheer up! My favorite was the roasted chicken. I can't wait to go back for more!"}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch on the great recommendation of a coworker who stated this was one of his favorite restaurants.   As many others have stated this is like Chipotle in that you pick your toppings for either nachos, tacos, or enchiladas. You can also get soup if you'd like.   I chose to keep it simple so I could really gauge the taste of my food. I chose one short rib enchilada and one chicken enchilada, Christmas style with jack cheese. It was quickly assembled and put in the oven.   The taste was great. The red sauce was thick and dark red, just how I like it. The green sauce could stand up against many New Mexican green chile and not be ashamed!   Now the short rib and chicken could have been a little more well seasoned, but I'm sure a dash or three of salt would have fixed it just fine. I like my stuff super spicy and well seasoned and most restaurants don't so I'm not knocking any points or stars off for that.   All in all this was an enjoyable eating experience and I'll definitely recommend it to others who are looking for fast and tasty enchiladas!"}
{"text":"Gadzooks never disappoints! For people just trying it for the first time, don't be intimidated! Just ask for some help :) the workers are always so patient and have good suggestions!!!"}
{"text":"Pros- Food is good. Lines are pretty fast.  Lots of toppings to choose from. The green corn casserole is amazing.  Cons- HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!!! Push you through the line so you don't get to look much.  They are SUPER SKIMPY on the meat that fill the enchiladas.  Small place inside gets really cramped up. PRICES are way too high for the quality, I feel that's the biggest downside....."}
{"text":"I think it's great when an entrepreneur comes up with a new concept.  This whole idea of enchiladas and soup is really cool and I'll bet he opens several more locations.  I had the tomatillo chicken and modelo braised short rib enchiladas.  Red and green sauces, honey vinaigrette slaw, jalapeno ranch dressing pico de gallo and cojita cheese.  Super yummy!  I also had some chips, salsa and a beer.  Overall it was a great meal.  I'd like to see a little more selection of beer (craft) and the table I sat at wasn't bussed from the previous diner's mess until halfway through my meal."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've visited. The first time was lunch during the week and the line was out the door. After waiting for a while with three tired kids we decided to try it again some other time. I'm so glad we came back. The food is great. I tried the enchiladas- you pick your meat and they have several veggie options. I picked the short rib for one and spinach and mushroom for the other. I picked the green sauce and the salsa verde to top it off.  I don't get the fried egg, but the option intrigues me. It was love at first bite- so much flavor. I can't wait to try more combinations. The only downside for me was that the kids quesadilla was served in a really hot dish (not great for little fingers) and the guacamole served with the chips and guac is very small"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best enchiladas I've had. The store is like Chipotle. You go in and order in steps. They put it in the oven to warm / let the cheese melt and then you get these gloriously cheesy and warm enchiladas. It's too bad that this isn't a chain. Totally worth going to."}
{"text":"I was driving by and figured I was up for something new.    The set up is bit like Chipotle for ordering, but the food is different enough to not be a facsimile of the other chain in any way.   The cornbread topping was excellent.  Get it!  The food and service were good.  Prices reasonable.  I went around 11:15am and there was no waiting.  When I finished the 11:30 lunch crowd was starting.  My impression is this place may have long lines at peak hours, so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"Great concept (bonus points because it was started by a young ASU graduate).  Tried the chicken and the short rib enchiladas with red and green salsa (Christmas style!), both kinds of cheese, pico, habanero salsa, and guacamole.  It was delicious!  It was pretty hectic/loud at lunch but what do you expect from a restaurant surrounded by businesses?  Also I didn't notice the \"oversalting\" of the food like some of the other reviewers but then again I love salt so who knows?  I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch about two weeks ago. Wasn't quite sure what to expect but this place was really great! Went in around 1:30 so it wasn't super busy. I had no idea what I wanted and the employees were all super helpful and patient while we decided, I wish I'd have written down their names but I thought I'd remember... what I do remember is how awesome the green Chile chicken enchilada was! The tortilla soup was equally fantastic and I'll definitely be back for more! Great little patio too!"}
{"text":"I love the idea of making my own enchiladas. It's my go-to when I eat at Mexican restaurants. This was so fresh, quick and delicious. I got the green Chile and chicken with Christmas sauce. Sides of the  potatoes and cornbread which I highly doubt  recommend. I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Great meal! 50/50 tortillas, genius.  I had shortrib enchiladas,  hubby had green chile and daughter had chicken. Great concept like Chipotle for enchiladas!  Good flavors wish there was one in California.  Definitely eating here again before leaving."}
{"text":"If you think you know enchiladas, think again until you try Gadzooks Echilads. Unreal, amazing options to build your enchiladas. Top five best eats in the entire Phoenix area. Sauces are perfect amount spice and savor, meats are premium and make sure to try the Modelo Bison. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Enchiladas just the way you want them. Line was a bit slow (lunch rush) but the food was great!"}
{"text":"I liked it. A little pricey but the selections were great, service prompt, and the meals were very flavorful. And they have beer.  My girlfriend and I went during her lunch hour on Wednesday and the parking lot was packed. We were served quickly on a buffet style line, and it was LOUD, it was a little tricky trying to figure out exactly how this place worked at first but only for a few seconds. I had bison taco's on full corn tortilla's, mixed cheese, baked and then topped with pico de gallo and some habanero sauce, My girlfriend had short rib enchilada's with 50/50 corn torts, asadero cheese, baked, topped with crema and pickled onion.  Despite the initial confusion and the crowd volume during the lunch rush, we both thoroughly enjoyed the quality and the speedy service. Will definitely be back and would recommend. Though it's best to be prepared and look at the online menu prior to arrival."}
{"text":"We enjoyed a great lunch there yesterday on their patio.  Ordering was difficult with the menu boards over your head but the staff was a great help with the dozens of options. The food was full of flavor, filling and  reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I love this place! It has a similar concept as Chipotle, but so much better. I first tried their taco at Hotel Thrillist last year and immediately fell in love! Pro tip: get enchiladas with the tomatillo chicken AND the sweet and spicy cornbread in the enchilada with green sauce on top - sweet, spicy and savory, all in 1 enchilada?! Sign me up! I also love how you can choose any toppings you want, which means you can customize your dish to whatever you feel like that day. Their toppings are phenomenal, and I usually like to get a little bit of everything- fresh slaw and pico de gallo, pickled red onions, crema, cotija cheese, and the Gadzooks buttermilk sauce (G SAUCE!).   You have to try this place."}
{"text":"The food was amazing and the options are so very unusual. Goat cheese on my enchiladas was a great addition.  The only drawback was the workers gave my lunch to somebody else much to my chagrin. But they were more than willing to correct the situation by quickly remaking my order, giving me chips/guac, and pastries. Wow! Thank you!"}
{"text":"The short: The sauces/salsas and soup were too salty for me, some of the seating was tight, and the ordering process was a bit confusing or overwhelming for new customers, but the fillings were really delicious--extra kudos for offering several tasty vegetarian options.   The long: If you're new, I recommend you stand back, look at the giant overhead menu, and formulate a game plan before you walk up to the counter, because once you do, you walk under the menu so it's out of sight. You have to be quick, too, because the only place to view the menu without being in the way is just inside the door. I wish the menu were along the back wall so it could always be in sight. Every dish is built the same way, even the soup, which is why I was confused when the toppings I requested in my enchiladas started to be piled on top of my soup.   We ended up getting a bowl of soup with green chili pork shoulder on top (I'd meant for it to go into the enchilada and couldn't stop them in time before they plopped it on top of the soup) and four enchiladas: guajillo braised short ribs, sauteed spinach mushroom, smashed jack potato, and cornbread in corn tortillas. All of these fillings were amazing--flavorful, clean, fresh, and filling. The pork shoulder and cornbread were my favorites. The pork was so, so tender and moist--probably one of the best savory bites I've had in a long time. We tried both the red and green sauces and the pico and salsa verde. This is where the salt shriveled my tongue, pickled my guts, and hardened my arteries. The soup was also way too salty for me, and I couldn't finish it. I got a fried egg on top of my enchiladas, and that was a bit salty, too. For the most part, I was glad the tortillas protected the fillings from the sauces because I ended up just prying into them and eating the fillings about halfway through. My boyfriend agreed that it was pretty salty, but he managed to finish most of his meal and didn't say it was too salty to finish. Honestly, I want to say it was just my taste buds, but it was the saltiest food I can remember eating.  As for the ambiance, it's all right. Plain furniture and walls, brightly lit, and thankfully no loud music, but the chairs, especially near the window, were tight. After I sat down, someone sat down behind me and trapped me in so I had to scoot out sideways because I couldn't even turn around to ask him to let me out. I'd aim for one of the tables down the middle of the room next time.  We finished off by splitting a glazed pumpkin cookie--tender and cakey, and one I'd definitely eat again.  I do want to try them again, but until I know if either my taste buds or their kitchen were just off or I've just gotten too sensitive to salty food, I think I'll just top my stuff with cheese and get some salsa on the side."}
{"text":"Some people compare this place to Chipotle, and they need to stop. As someone who loves Chipotle even more than the proper amount, Gadzooks blows them out of the water.  All of the potential fillings for your enchiladas are flavorful. Like, not that silly chef's kind of flavorful that involves words like \"light\" and \"delicate.\" These are some serious enchiladas with some serious, robust flavors. The spicy cornbread for example? It's actually spicy, and corny, and sweet. Also, you can get your enchiladas in chiles after 4:00 p.m. or some kind of delicious insanity. You can also add eggs, and they have a huge variety of sauces and toppings.   Just go here. I don't care if you're a local, native, hipster or old foagie. Ignorance is not bliss. Enchiladas is bliss."}
{"text":"The enchiladas were really good but the tortilla soup was just ok. I took my kid who is 7 and we had a little trouble finding something for her to eat. The gal behind encounter was very accommodating and made her something that she wanted. We'll go again."}
{"text":"Really great food - cornbread is a must!  Corn flour tortillas are the best.  Long lines during the week, get there right when it opens."}
{"text":"Innovative concept, surprising variety of menu options and fresh ingredients. It is a couple more bucks per person than Chipotle or Q-Doba but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Seriously, how have you lived your life so far in the Valley without knowing about this place??? Best. Stuff. EVER.   My mouth is watering now as I'm starting to write this... Those enchiladas... yum... After we discovered it, we've been religiously visiting it whenever we can get a day off, early in the morning and you really need to get in as soon as they open, because the place gets packed and line forms around 11.30... which is 30 minutes after opening. Whatever special they have going on for the day, it's gone by 12... Soooo, yeah, get in early :D You won't make a mistake with whatever you try! The ingredients that they use and have to offer are just great and fresh all the way. And you can see them right there in front of you!  Do yourself a favor and get to it whenever you can!"}
{"text":"In keeping with \"Poor Review after one visit (why would I go again?) and a Good Review after at least two visits\" I regret having to write this one after only one Review. I approached the experience with VERY high hopes. I let the \"Server,\" who was extraordinarily helpful and very upbeat, decide what I should \"try\" on my first visit. He suggested:                One Green Chili Pork Shoulder Enchilada                One  Short Rib Enchilada  My Server covered it and after a bit of time in the Brick Over, added Guacamole and Crema (again his recommendation).  One problem, they both tasted identical. Couldn't tell the difference. I believe this stems form everything hot being kept in a steam table (ugh!) and obviously NOT freshly prepared. The taste was spicy but considering the amount of meat (a fairly good portion) I was surprised that the meat taste didn't come through.  The cost of over $9 for two relatively small Enchiladas I thought was a bit steep, but if the quality was better, maybe okay.  With so many good to great \"Mexican\" alternatives, wouldn't rank in my Top Ten by any stretch.  VERY disappointed!"}
{"text":"Good concept, but falls short in some areas. Service varies. The cashier seemed confused the last time I checked out and was having trouble ringing up people's orders. I think the food is overpriced for what you get. It is very loud inside and seating is limited during the lunch rush. My favorite item is the pumpkin cookies with that brown sugar/butter glaze they keep by the cash register. Not a great sign when dessert is what you like best at a lunch spot. Fun to try, but will not be a place I frequent."}
{"text":"I was here at the opening bell on a Saturday with a group that took over about 1/2 the seating inside, and it was hot outside. The food was good. The folks working there were pleasant and knowledgeable.  I don't think I care for the assembly line in this case. It gets all bunched up because halfway through the process your meal goes in the oven but you can't just walk away because in a few minutes you have some more choices to make.  It does have parking which is a plus downtown."}
{"text":"It's good. It really is. But their vegetarian/pescatarian options  aren't great. In the end your enchilada is mushy with a weird menagerie of tastes. It's at least a one time visit."}
{"text":"Do you love enchiladas? I do! Just as much as I love tacos, sadly my family does not share the same love of enchiladas, so it's very rare that I get to have them at home. So when I heard about Gadzooks Enchiladas & Soup I knew I would be trying them out soon!   It's a pretty simple ordering processes, you pick your main dish (enchiladas, tacos or soup), what to put into your dish (protein choice, from veggie to meat) and how you like it topped (green or red sauce, or both) and what cheeses, then it goes into an opened oven to bake to melt the cheese, then you top it with some salsas and other fun items.  I went with 3 enchiladas, part flour part corn tortillas, and tried the stuffed poblano, sweet and spicy cornbread and roasted tomatillo chicken with half green & red sauce and topped it with some pico and habanero lava and had some creama drizzled over the top.  These were good enchiladas, very large and filling, the stuffed poblano was my least liked, it was the one lacking the most flavor but I was surprised by the sweet and spicy cornbread it was very tasty.    Definitely fulfilled my enchilada craving and look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"I hate to be a downer on a local business, but given all the inflated reviews I needed to share our take... In theory, this place is amazing, local, and a lot of fun. The woman in line in front of us said, \"Who would go to Chipotle when you have such a gem in the neighborhood?\" I thought she must be right, but after my husband and I sampled our enchiladas and soup, we both wished we'd had chipotle. The potato soup was very salty, but I forgave them, because potatoes. The enchiladas just weren't good. Maybe it was an off night? Or maybe it was the intense pilling of sauces but our to go containers were ultimately just salty, bland, mush. There was no prominent flavor profile to be excited about, no texture that enticed me, and overall just nothing that made me want to finish my meal. The mushroom and spinach was all spinach. The red chile was more of a mole and than a traditional red chile. The flavor of the cornbread was tasty, but I barely got a taste of it because it was drenched in the green sauce, which was pretty bland. I really really wanted to like Gadzooks, but we ended up ordering a pizza afterwards because we were so shockingly disappointed in the taste/quality of our food. :("}
{"text":"First off...the food is fresh and hot.  Prices are very reasonable.  The tacos and enchiladas are amazing!  If you are in the mood for a quick lunch or dinner this is the spot. Very casual.  It is order and seat yourself style which isn't my favorite but the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place since they opened! Wish I would've gone there sooner! Being a beginner, it was a little confusing but they walked me through the process well. I chose to have the enchiladas one corn bread and one pulled pork and both red and green chili sauce. They were excellent I love enchiladas! So many choices it was hard to decide. They also have hand smashed guacamole which looked amazing. I will try it next time. You can choose to have street tacos or salad, but definitely Go! Now! Really Go!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely the highlight of my trips to Phoenix! The concept is kind of like a Chipotle with enchiladas, except unlike Chipotle the flavors at Gadzooks are EXCEPTIONAL! First timers should definitely get the tomatillo chicken (I usually hate shredded chicken, but this was a major WOW for me) and the tortilla soup topped with the cornbread filling. The atmosphere is great with thoughtful minimal design details (they converted it from a gas station!) and their staff is super helpful -- everyone is very much on top of their game to make it a streamlined ordering process. My only complaint is that they don't have a location in California... yet! I can see this restaurant expanding and being very successful at anything they set their minds to. Kudos!!"}
{"text":"5 stars for the food, let's be clear about that. The fallout comes from the inability by the staff to keep the place clean. Every surface of the restaurant is sticky. Tables, chairs, floors... There are more flies in this restaurant than on a camels rear. Please hire a bus boy asap.   No clean dishes or silverware. They handed us our food in the togo container and I proceeded to eat my enchiladas with a spoon.   Again the food is awesome. But this place has the upkeep of your local dive bar."}
{"text":"Seating is in short supply here!  There are also no misters outside for summer seating. Great flavorful enchiladas done Chipotle assembly style with a local Phoenix twist.  Multiple meat, cheese and sauce selections.  They are so great they allow you to mix and match!  I had the pork and chicken.  I loved the slaw add on, I don't see that often.  They also heat it up in a fire.  You also have two different style enchilada shells.  Staff is very helpful and guided me in my first time ordering.  I left with a hook up-enchilada style!  I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Gourmet and great spin off from chipotle. The staff is always friendly and the cornbread is amazing. Plus what seems like a great selection of premium choices like braised meat, short rib, and all other flavors. Excited to see this take off and more locations open up closer to us."}
{"text":"So sad, went down here all excited to try based off the reviews, and the one chicken item they have, has gluten. Hopefully they can make an alternative chicken that doesn't contain gluten so more people can eat there!"}
{"text":"I've literally eaten here 4 times this week.  It's a little expensive, ($22 for 5 enchiladas, an egg and two drinks), which is why I am stuck on giving it less than 5 stars. But otherwise, I think it could be worth the money considering how unique and customizable it is. I don't know, I just want everything to be free, so I'm at like 4.5 stars on this one...  Anyway, the food tastes great. Really unique, authentic options. I really recommend the red sauce, corn tortillas, pork, chicken, an over-medium egg, slaw, jalapeno ranch and cotija cheese...that's what I ALWAYS get. They have really good chips and salsa, too.  The staff is friendly. My only complaint is that there are SO many options, that I think they could benefit from having labels on the glass telling you what everything is, that way you don't have to stare straight up and get lost on the menu and waste their time, but they do a good job of explaining it anyway. Still, I like doing things myself instead of asking the same dumb question every time.   They serve in their own little wood-fired ceramic bowls which is cute and unique, too.  They said they don't like hearing \"this is kinda like Chipotle!\" so I will say this place is better than Chipotle, but very similar :)  They serve enchiladas, chopped salads, stuffed poblano peppers and have other specials.   Take all of my money, Gadzooks. You are so yummy."}
{"text":"The Meal.  The lava sauce was spicy: heat and smokiness; great stuff. The potato jack enchiladas Christmas style with Chihuahua Cheese and topped with freshly made sour cream was DELISH!  I enjoyed the oven where they heat up your clay dish holding your enchiladas; it is brilliant!  The only thing that I think could be improved upon, meal wise, is the corn tortilla itself.  The tortilla was too thick, which led to it unrolling while it was being prepared and while eating it.  I think if they were to make it just a little thinner, it would make the tortilla hold its shape better.  Service.  It's still their first week.  They were nice and ready to answer questions, but a little slow getting ready for the lunch time crowd.  It was fine, we weren't in a rush, but one thing to improve is have one person for each station.  While I was attended there were multiple people, some unsure where to go and what to do, and only a couple of people preparing the dish, which led to a bit of chaos and time delay in the kitchen side.    Ambiance. The place was nice, clean, modern, and casual. Love it! Especially the light fixtures! The patio outside was great!  Maybe one thing to consider is add a couple of those pavers from your patio exit to the north parking lot  along the gravel garden, you know to reduce people walking all over your rock and ruining the wonderful landscaping.    Portion. The two enchilada plate did not fill the stomachs of my coworkers, nor mine, we filled our cups twice with beverage and that held us over.  One of the guys did get a three enchilada plate with a drink and that did the trick for him."}
{"text":"SOO GOOD!  The food here is AMAZING. Big portion sizes and fresh ingredients. It is set up similar to a Mod Pizza or Chipotle where you build your own enchilada. They have tons of toppings to customize your enchiladas at no extra cost.  I will say that every time we have come here at lunch they have messed up one or two people in my group's order. They need a better system when it comes to putting the enchiladas into the oven. (Maybe some way to mark the dish?) Seems like the people at the front half of the process get too far ahead and before you know it they are losing orders/adding red sauce to the wrong order, etc. I hope they can streamline this process a little better.  Still a huge fan! The food speaks for itself."}
{"text":"The concept here is like a higher end version of Chipotle but with enchiladas rather than burritos. They have multiple vegetarian options, which is refreshing, and they are delicious. One is a spinach and mushroom combo and the other is mashed potatoes with jack cheese, so more than just your normal cheese enchilada or rice and beans."}
{"text":"Check out this hipster spot!  The Enchiladas are not your whole in the wall variety.  You can customize the inside, outside, and aroundsides on this bad boy.    Great concept, great food.  Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"If I lived in this area I could easily see this place being a regular spot, but with so many options, it may be a while before I hit this one up again.  I'm just gunna call this gourmet enchiladas. Delicious enchiladas. It's not a dining experience, but good for a one hat show."}
{"text":"I am in love with this place!  Positives: You walk in and choose what type of meat,sauce,etc in a line.  They assemble your dish as you watch,  not realizing how delicious they truly are til you take a bite. I recommend doing 2-3 enchiladas and mix the sauce(red and green)  You choose everything you want to add in.    I wasn't expecting amazing but it certainly was.   Negatives: Nothing really!  It's a smaller place but we had no problem finding seating. I suppose during a busy time it could be snug.   I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Came here fr a nice dinner date wt the girlfriend nd was not dissapointed.. The tacos were great as well as the enchiladas.. Definitely try this place out if ur in a mood fr a good meal.. Not to mention the pumpkin cookie wt the maple cream topping.."}
{"text":"Discovered this place last year and I'm in love. Build my own enchilada watch them cook it in a open stove. Top it with many great toppings and natural ingredients! Delicious!"}
{"text":"I went during their opening week and despite the obvious challenges they faced while learning a new restaurant and concept and staff I went back because the food is off the hook good and cheap as hell.  Both times I got the half and half tortillas, I like the softness of the masa. I also got the chicken and short rib. The chicken is light and flavorful, the short rib is hearty and savory and smoky.  I chose the \"Christmas\" sauce, half red, half green. the green is fruity, light and refreshing while the red is super smoky and hearty. I like the red better and need to remind myself for next time but the two together make a nice contrast.  I got the cheddar cheese and then the guac and pico with the habanero on the side, its hot, and I mean hot. What I think is hot most people cannot eat. To me the habanero is edible but if you use too much you could ruin the meal.  My friend got the chicken and the mushroom and loved both. He also tried the jalapeno ranch dressing and it was awesome ( I stole some).  The first time we visited was their opening week and the wait was tough, the food ran out, the staff was over their heads.  This time the wait was non existent, the food plentiful and fresh and the staff orderly and efficient. What a difference a few months made!!  Some people complain of \"chipotle with enchiladas\", and the resemblance is there in the production line and the mexican flavor but thats where it ends. With the huge amount of choices and customization as well as the food being 10x as flavorful this is the clear winner.  The food is as flavorful as Richardsons or Barrio Cafe. no joke.  I am glad to see they worked out the bugs.  Eat here. Again and again."}
{"text":"Despite rave reviews from other Yelpers and friends, I found my Gadzooks experience tonight fairly average. Now, my choices were more limited as a vegan, but I was looking forward to the spinach-mushroom tacos. I topped them off with Pico de Gallo and guacamole. We also ordered the chips with the roasted Roja salsa.  The corn tortillas were outstanding and held up so well to the filling. I found the sauteed spinach-mushroom combo to be okay, not anything too flavorful. The guacamole needed something more, in my opinion. If I am going to eat guacamole while visiting AZ, I have high expectations. I thought it was bland. The chips were also okay. So, my meal was good but nothing that would bring me back in a hurry. I will say the enchiladas looked delicious. Worth a try if you are in the area, especially for cheese and meat lovers."}
{"text":"This place rules! Enchiladas are great. Short ribs and Modelo braised bison! Gotta get there during lunch for the bison or they'll run out. Excellent food and good Mexican beer"}
{"text":"Gadzooks. Mm.  Words can't describe how amazing the food is here. It's basically a place where you make your own enchiladas in a serving line type of ordering style similar to Chipotle and Qdoba.   You start with their own half and half corn/flour tortilla, or just a corn (get the half and half)...and then you choose your fillings. They have braised beef, green Chile pork, chicken, and some other fillers like potatoes, and a corn bread thing that is bomb.   Then you pick you enchilada sauce, your cheese - then they throw it in an oven behind them and let the cheese get all melty. After that you can top it with their honey slaw, cotija cheese, sour cream, jalapeño ranch...a FRIED EGG....a bunch of good stuff. It's amazing.   The service is pretty good, all the staff is friendly. Overall, if you like enchiladas or Mexican food in general, you should definitely try this place."}
{"text":"Pretty good! This was our last meal before leaving Phoenix and I'm glad we picked this place.  Like others have said, it's Chipotle-style so you build your own bowl. I ended up going with a salad and my boyfriend got the enchiladas. I was pleasantly surprised at how good both were. The enchiladas were sloppy, flavorful, perfect. My salad with fresh romaine was chopped after adding all the ingredients I picked and tossed in the dressing altogether. Specifically I remember asking for a ton of pico de gallo, corn, broccoli/cabbage slaw. I got the shredded chicken and a jalapeno-based dressing which was pretty spicy.  I got a side of the corn bread and it was so delicious. It was more of a warm pudding and was slightly sweet, plentiful corny, fluffy, decadent, slightly burnt on the edges, with just the right amount of kick / spice."}
{"text":"This place is a new building with a small parking lot. The look was fresh and new, I just didn't like the chalkboard menu, you have to tilt your head back to view it all, wayyy back. The inside seating isn't that huge but they do offer additional seating outside. With the nice weather (73F) it's not to bad...for now...  I ordered the 2 enchilada's with corn tortilla, 1 pork and 1 chicken. The chicken tasted like I could've made it at home, and thats not a compliment. The pork was much better. I got green sauce on top with cheddar cheese. After they stuck it in the fire stove and melted the cheese, I asked for the hottest salsa (a red sauce), pico de gallo and a side of the cabbage stuff. Don't know what the cabbage was exactly called, but that was delicious. Just those two were enough to fill me up. I don't eat enchilada's that often and when I do, its pretty basic. But there was so much options that my choices didn't actually come together. That doesn't take away from the place though.  Next visit I'll try the beef and the mushroom spinach enchilada. They also have bison, but I'll take a pass on that. What I thought was interesting was when you go to pay, they ask if any of the food items is bison, basically going off the honor system of you telling them it is or not. When I walked in there were about 6 people in front of me. When I sat down, there was 20 people behind me. The cashier was talking to another guest and she was saying that they are always packed. So plan to wait.  What annoyed me: The bathroom's are locked. I guess you have to ask for the key, not sure since I was annoyed and decided to hold it. lol The \"service line\" wasn't at their best. The first guy was making fresh tortilla's and when he put my tortilla's on the line he decided not to keep going and put the meat in.(He did for the guy in front of me, I guess because there was no one behind me?) He could've finished IMO. The second guy was in charge of meat and cheese...thats it...he could've assisted the third person - she had to pop them in the oven, finish the topping THAN check the customer out. He didn't move....that would've pissed me off if I was her. While waiting for my meal to melt, one other person appeared from the back and stood at the beginning...but no one still bothered to help the last person.  What made me happy: They had cream soda. lol"}
{"text":"I went here based on yelp reviews.  Summary:  Cheap, quick meal with the same concept and price as Chipotle but enchilada style.  You pick flour or corn, what type of fill, what kind of sauce, cheese, toppings, etc.  They heat it up for you and you are good to go.    Here are the issues I encountered:  I went here with a friend and we had no idea how to get started so we kept reading the chalkboard(s) to figure it out.  The first person on the assembly line was extremely rude asking questions as if she was annoyed.  Can't she freaking tell we have never been here before and we have no idea what the hell we are doing?  Then, the next person - same thing.  The guy asked me what type of sauce, what cheeses, toppings, etc and seemed annoyed.  Last position - the cashier.  We had asked for the meal \"to go\" as I usually expect to not eat my whole meal even though we were planning to eat there. I tell her that we plan to eat there even though we ordered \"to go\" and she too had this annoyed look on her face.    My friend and I started talking about what just happened.  He asks, \"Was it just me or did it seem like they were annoyed with us?\"  We then start watching the assembly line with other customers that came in after us to see if it was something with \"us\" or in general.  So of course, the first batch of customers walk up the assembly line.  The worker starts asking the customers if they have ever been (and they have not). She starts explaining how it works, etc.  So it was a completely different treatment.      The food was ok.  They could of heated the enchilada a little bit longer.  However, based on the customer service, me thinks not."}
{"text":"Our 1st visit was amazing. Had different enchiladas. Pork shoulder, beef short rib, & chicken. Also tried tortilla soup with pork shoulder. All food was amazing!!! Can be a bit spicy for those sensitive to spice, but it was perfect for us! Topped off dinner with sangria & a margarita! We will be back."}
{"text":"Really good food. Clean. Cheap. Friendly. Win."}
{"text":"Several reviewers mentioned that the spinach & mushroom filling is vegetarian. If Aaron Pool makes it the same way that it's listed in the recipe he share with the Arizona Republic today, it is NOT VEGETARIAN (chicken stock).  I am shocked that several reviewers (who are vegetarians) seem to have had staff members steer them toward this option, despite the fact that it is NOT vegetarian.  Really? Why not just use vegetable stock? And if something seems veg, but is not, please tell your staff.  Here is the recipe that Mr. Pool shared: http://www.azcentral.com/story/life/food/recipes/2014/04/22/spinach-mushroom-enchilada-filling/8013227/"}
{"text":"Don't expect \"authentic\" on this, it's their own twist on enchiladas, that's not necessarily a bad thing. I had the green chili with bison, they were very good, although it's hard to reduce the acidity in the tomatillos, other than that you just have to add the right toppings. This joint uses a method similar to Chipotle's; everything is in front of you, which is good!"}
{"text":"Awesome Amazing service Starving and this place made me smile Got the two enchilada one with green chile pork the other with short rib And their chicken with corn bread taco This place exceeded all expectation"}
{"text":"I've been watching this place under construction for a while, and was glad to have the opportunity to pick up a late lunch to go today.  I wanted to try a variety of their options, so I got a 2 enchilada plate with chicken with green sauce and short rib with red sauce, as well as an order of chips with hot salsa on the side.  The food was fantastic.  I was a little skeptical of how they were going to pull off the cheese part in a to go order (my favorite part of enchiladas is the melted cheese on top!) but by putting the enchiladas in the oven right in a foil to go dish, the cheese was melted perfectly!  Both meats were tasty and high quality, and the sauces were savory and amazing.  The chips were clearly homemade and the salsa was plenty spicy but also flavorful.  I took off one star for an ambiance issue - it was SO loud in there with all of the stone/metal surfaces that it was hard to hear and speak to the line cooks to place my order without shouting and leaning a bit toward/over the super high glass partition.  A little bit of insulation for noise reduction would do wonders.  I can't wait to go back and try the cornbread and mashed potato enchiladas, as well as the chicken tortilla soup!"}
{"text":"GREAT food-- in massive amounts! The setup at Gadzooks is kind of chipotle/ subway style; you walk through the service line and tell the servers what you want in your enchiladas/ tacos/ etc, pay, and take your food to your table. I was kind of overwhelmed by the number of options, but the staff was mostly helpful and the food was ready in no time!  I had a spinach and mushroom enchilada and a potato enchilada with an egg on top. I would highly recommend the potato; it sounds like a weird combination but is really good! I was so stuffed, I wish I had only ordered one enchilada. I also had the grapefruit margarita, which wasn't that grapefruity but was nice and refreshing. We added on an order of chips and guacamole. The chips are amazing, but we only got a tiny serving of guacamole, which was kind of disappointing."}
{"text":"Ok- I'm from SD so Mexican food is hard to please as we have a ton and are right next to TJ! Ordered via post mates and honestly wasn't expecting much. I was so pleasantly surprised! It's kinda like chipotle you add all the toppings and such that you want! Very flavorful & pickled onions were yummy. Salad was slightly over dressed but I think it's because I added everything on the menu haha. Will come again when I'm visiting and do recommend you check it out if you are on the fence!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to go either by yourself or with one other person. Somewhat difficult to order and sit with a group, especially when the restaurant is busy.   Food is really really good, though.  I got 2 enchilads with the green chile pork, red sauce, over easy egg, and guac. Definitely worth the additional cash, I t hink.   Overall the atmosphere of this place is decent. It's like the chipotle of enchialada places which is nice. Nothing that sets it apart, really."}
{"text":"Saw the google review pics of this place while researching food in the area.  I had just finished eating, and I was STILL drooling over the pics!  Had to try it, and just did.  This place makes some great eats!  Awesome flavors and combinations.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"I can't even ... We had several locals recommend coming here so we did, and it blew away an expectation I had. We had the fiesta tacos, and they were delicious!! So so good.  The server forgot to give us our guacamole and when I went up to get it I mentioned that my food was eaten and asked what the price of tortillas is. It was too expensive in my opinion for an error on there part...I had hoped they would discount or comp them since it wasn't my fault. Having said that, the guacamole was delicious! Yes, it would have been better on my taco, but I'm not mad about it and I would go back again.   @trailmixandchocolate"}
{"text":"I've been twice, and I've loved it all. I recommend the enchiladas with potatoes and cheese, and their s'mores cookies are fantastic!  Edited to change from 4 stars to 5: their nachos give me lifeeeee!"}
{"text":"I've been to GadZooks a few times. I go here when I want an enchilada that's got a little extra something. I love being able to customize. And they have an overwhelming number of options so I recommend going with someone who can suggest something to get you started. (I need a lot of time to take in all the options which doesn't work if you're eating with other people.) anyway I had the cornbread in my enchilada. (It sounds a little weird but it's really really good!) I've tried both the red mesquite sauce and the green sauce.  I thought the mesquite was too hot for me but it was really good if you like that.  I haven't had any issues with service."}
{"text":"Great food and service. It's my once a week place for lunch. The short rib is packed with great flavors and the tomatillo chicken also tasty."}
{"text":"Pretty good lunch. I ordered two enchiladas and tortilla soup. I filled my enchiladas with bison and pork and chose the \"hybrid\" tortilla. Everything was good, but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Quick, tasty and always on point! This place is very efficient and always clean. Favorite would have to be the chicken tortilla soup but the pork tacos and mashed potatoes are definitely up there as well! We usually stop here for a quick bite before heading over to Taco Guild across the street."}
{"text":"I love love love Gadazooks. Their half corn/half flour tortillas are phenom and their green pork chili is fantastic. I tend to get the same thing every time I go but I know the enchiladas are phenomenal and I will try them soon!"}
{"text":"One of my favorites. Imagine Chipotle at much higher level with the best possible ingredients. Love, love this place and crave it a couple times per week."}
{"text":"I was excited to see an enchilada and soup shop open.  Soup... not soups... they only serve one kind. The food is flavorful but the process is difficult. The staff appear grungy and have no sense of urgency. It's concerning they don't wear hair nets. One of the employee's pants had grease stains and the t shirts on the gals were grossly form fitting. Just not what I expect when someone is making my food.   I've been twice. Once when they opened and again a few weeks ago.  Both times they were out of something on the menu.  The concept of a string tying machine is interesting but completely a waste. It almost seems as though they rushed to open and skipped on important details. I truly hope the owner reads these reviews because the food is good and the place has such potential. It seems like there are too many employees on shift which makes for a complete social hour.  I drive by every day and am starting to see an empty parking lot. I hope the owner acts on just a few of these issues. It would be a shame to see this place close needlessly.  PS... It appears another taco shop is opening up across the street. Please take action and make it easier for patrons to support local business."}
{"text":"OMG is all I can say. Absolutely delicious. I took the employees advice and did enchilada style short rib and pulled pork with Christmas sauce. I wish now I did the fried egg on top. The slaw and pickled onions are just the right toppings. And to finish off your meal you must get a pumpkin cookie. Definitely recommend to all."}
{"text":"This is a place I have drove past a dozen times, and today I finally stopped in. It was as good as the hype.  I kind of resent that it get compared to chipotle, its a similar set up but the taste is far supiror. I had two tacos one Chicken one beef, meat had so much flavor, and I could probably eat a whole plate full of those pickles onions. The soup was amazing as well."}
{"text":"The Chiptole of enchiladas. You come down along a line and pick what kind of tortillas you want, meat, sauce, etc. I felt as though with so many options the enchilada wasn't perfected. I only came here once, and probably won't be returning. I you are looking for quantity, in terms of kinds & types of enchiladas, then this is your place."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Soup is wonderfully fresh, filling, and flavorful.  I only wish they offered black beans."}
{"text":"I came in here for the first time a few weeks after it opened, during their lunch rush with my dad. It was definitely not what I was expecting, instead it was a Chipotle like make line for enchiladas, tacos, soups, and salads.   I immediately felt trepidation about the quality of food, and guilty that I was making my dad deal with a jam packed place that might not even be good.  The first bite I took of their green chili pork enchilada eased those worries in a heart beat. Even my dad, who hates crowds and considers himself a foodie was applauding every bite of his red chili enchiladas.  Flast forward two years and this place has remained just as utterly delicious as the very first time. Ive brought more friends and family since, tried each of their meats and even an amazing potato hash option they have. Everyone I know absolutely loves this place, especially if they came early enough to try the bison which is only served until 2pm.  When its not lunch hour, or you stop in during the weekend, the place is spacious, with plenty of seats inside or outside on their large pet friendly patio. Its a perfect place to have a relaxing lunch, grab a cervesa, and chat with friends or family. Especially since after two enchiladas, you barely want to move!  As for suggestions, I'd say definitely try the rib or bison if you get the chance, order one of their delicious cookies, and dont be afraid to try all their amazing toppings, there's no going wrong here and they'll even add things on the side if you're nervous about liking something or not."}
{"text":"If Chipotle and Los Agaves had a baby her name would be Gadzooks. Simple and affordable yet exotic and delicious. A mouth-watering explosion of flavors!  Can you say gourmet fast-food?  So many combinations of yumminess at your disposal and for you to create.  There was no line and a huge overwhelming chalkboard featured an array of fabulous fixings. It was too much to absorb, taste-bud overload.    Sauteed spinach mushroom,  creamy goat cheese,  Jalapeño smashed potatoes,  guacamole,  spicy cornbread hash,  hand-made corn and flour mixed tortillas,  6-8 types of chili sauce...wow!  You start by choosing either an enchilada or taco or a combination.  I chose two enchiladas.  Then choose your fillings: like  shredded pork,  shredded chicken or  shredded short ribs,  you choose a red or green sauce and you have various topping to choose from like:  vinaigrette slaw, creme, cotija cheese, pickled onions, hot sauce for more spice like pico or lava (habanero).   Then more \"dressings\" like:  buttermilk,  honeysuckle vinaigrette or  jalapeño ranch.   You can dress your dish anyway you want.    If your order is \"to stay\" your enchilada is placed inside a clay pot and put it in the oven for all the flavors to melt together.    Thirsty? Great choices for drinks too:  Margarita,  Sangria,  Mexican Beer,  Trendy Sodas   I topped my meal off with a Pacifico Mexican beer and a lime. MMMM  I don't like tip-jars but I tipped here. The staff is friendly helpful and they bus they tables.  Don't forget your pumpkin spice cookie for dessert!  A cake like soft cookie decorated with a simple sugar frosting.  MMMM perfect ending.  Thank you for staying open past 9 p.m. (closes at 10 p.m.)   Outdoor patio seating available.   If you haven't been here what are you waiting for?"}
{"text":"I like this place a lot. I want to love it more, I really do but there are just some things that I've noticed in the few times coming here. Number 1 I love the cornbread it's excellent. But when it comes to ordering it's really hard to  communicate between the really tall thick plexi glass of what you want. Also, I think it would be nice if you could label what we are looking at behind the glass because for the first timers it's hard to tell what each little container has in it. You can only really kinda guess by glancing at the menu and then glancing back at the toppings to kind of guess what each one is. This takes up time and holds up the rest of the line from moving quickly."}
{"text":"Gadzooks, for me, was somewhat boring.   I was taken to Gadzooks for lunch, with a couple of friends. We had heard that the food was great, so we decided to test it out.  The menu was/is confusing, too many sauces. Choosing the right combo seemed just like an unlikely happening..  Overall my food was bland and unimpressive. We all almost left half of our food on our plates.  Staff was great, friendly. Helpful and knowledgeable.   3 stars just for the fact that the staff was pretty much the highlight. I probably won't return. I just really wanted to like this place."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of tortilla soup and the fact that I got to add braised beef to it as an alternative to chicken was awesome!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time tonight and it was amazing! Everything was flavorful and the staff was really helpful! I will definitely go again. And again."}
{"text":"This is our go to place when we are in the Central Phoenix area.  We usually go for dinner and it's usually crowded.  Today for an early brunch, it was not too busy.  This was great because we always feel stressed out ordering because there are so many options to choose from.  I recommend the two enchiladas, on 50/50 mix tortilla with a mix of pork and cornbread, or pork and mashed potatoes.... I know, sounds super weird, but it's super good.  I get all the toppings and when I remember, I ask for an over easy egg.  I usually get the super spicy sauces, and they are spicy, but not overpowering.    The food is excellent and the service is top notch as well.    Why not 5 stars?  Complicated menu that gets easier when you go frequently, and you can hardly hear the employees because of the glass barrier.  Excited to see they have a location on Camelback now. Will have to try it as it's closer to my North Phoenix location."}
{"text":"I'm big on Mexican soups, I failed to realize that the word soup in the business name was singular. Only one soup offered here \"Tortilla Soup\" I didn't try it. I had the spinach & mushroom enchilada, with an sunny side up egg. It was delicious."}
{"text":"This place makes really good food. It is like the enchilada version of chipotle and definitely worth a try if you're in the area. You have just about any combination you can think of. And the mashed potatoes are sooooo worth it."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch and got two tacos - one chicken, one pork. The menu is a little confusing and you're stuck gaping at the chalkboard on the ceiling while the workers stare at you, which is weird and not too flattering. I'd much rather have the choices on the glass in front of the toppings and myself or a menu on the side wall, so I can just pick what I want down the assembly line without having to listen to the explanation of each. I'm not a fan of Chipotle and didn't realize this is basically the same concept.  As mentioned in other reviews, they didn't bake the enchiladas (my mom's choice) very long. I also had my tacos baked to melt the cheese which was a nice option. The tortillas were VERY good (we got the lard mix), the meat was a good quality and tasty, I liked the cabbage mix also. I added guacamole for $1 but it was little too spicy for me - most people would probably like it. The tacos were STUFFED and overall really good. I didn't try mom's enchiladas because she said the green sauce would be too spicy for me (I'm a wuss when it comes to spice, what can I say).   Two plates with a soda for just under $20. Not the most cost effective lunch I've had, but seems pretty standard. Would love the menu location change/expansion, longer oven bake time, and a way to buy those tortillas to go."}
{"text":"This place is very adorable and affordable! It tasted great and was filling. I recommend the sweet corn bread in a corn tortilla... It was so flavorful and unique. I will definitely be back! Happy eatings :)"}
{"text":"The food is bomb. I usually get short rib and chicken enchiladas with both sauces. The service could be better. The cashier swiped my card, gave it back to me, then walked away. I wasn't sure if the transaction was done or not.  I literally had to ask if it went through. No \"thank you\" or \"have a great day!\" I personally don't care about bad service I just want to know if I can leave and eat my food lol"}
{"text":"This place is a MUST-TRY!   It looks and feels like a Chipotle when you walk in the door, but with a tad bit more edge and freedom. The enchiladas here are amazing!  I ordered two enchiladas  (beef and pork), smothered \"Christmas-style\" (the New Mexico way and the way God intended!), and topped it with fresh crema, cheese and hot (truly hot) habenaro chili sauce. Sooooooooo much flavor! Really kicks you in the taste buds and takes them for ransom! Amazing! Definitely coming back!  I also purchased some cool looking cooking at the counter that turned out to taste like pumpkin and I almost had to cut my \"friends'\" hands off for trying to steal them. Delectable!"}
{"text":"This was soooooo good. Think Chipolte style but enchiladas instead of a burrito. Incredible mix of fillings. I'm so Impressed. I wish there was one in the East Valley"}
{"text":"Thank you Yelpers for helping on this one.  For my first night in PHX I wanted Mexican but was not sure of just where. I stumbled on this place with the guidance of Yelp.  I was smart to look online in the parking lot to check out the menu so I could get a feel for how it worked, what they had etc. This was a good move, the menu is a chalkboard that is about 15' long and above the counter so you feel like you are trying to look for Haley's comet while reading the menu. This is not a criticism just an observation.  Now the food, this is high end Mexican fusion. You pick everything to make your custom enchiladas. The meat the sauce you name it everything is yours to choose. And it's really hard as they have VERY good ingredients.  I went for 2 'ladas 1 green chile pork shoulder, and 1 briased beef short rib, then I went Chirstmas with the sauce (1 red and 1 green). FRom here you can add a fired egg, more cheese, hand made quac. The whole enchilada is here... unless you want this as a taco then its the whole taco.  If you are in the PHX area drop in get some enchiladas or tacos and let me know what you think. Remember to check out the menu before you go your neck will thank you."}
{"text":"Love this place. I am pregnant and every time I walk in I am overjoyed by the smells. We've gotten soups and tacos, chips and guacamole each time and they are all delicious. I never get tired of the tortilla soup and the tacos are a great size. The prices are amazing for how great the food is. Saw a good deal of complaints on these reviews about the cleanliness and I think the management is doing things about it, saw an employee wiping everything down when I was there today. Someday when I'm really hungry, I'll try an enchilada. I can't wait! Yum"}
{"text":"This tiny enchie shop is making a name for itself far and wide. Two other people had already told me about this place before my companion and I ate lunch here. It didn't disappoint.  The line moved quickly given the fact each order was individually made. The employees are adept, and the food is enticing and delicious even though its served in bowls that are reminiscent of dog dishes.  Clean, retro-industrial decor with a chalkboard menu which features specials and limited-time offers.  I had the salad, with chicken and toppings. Tacos, enchies and soup are other options.  Word to the starch fans: no beans or rice to be found here. If you want extra calories, you'll have to find them in the cookies or corn chips.  Outdoor seating also available. Soda or beer."}
{"text":"At first glance, the place is reminiscent of Chipotle, however the food actually has flavor. This has easily become one of my favorite Mexican joints in Phoenix. This is definitely for guys like myself who are always trying to grab something filling and fairly cheap like chipotle, but are starting to become sick of the same bland flavors of Chipotle. I usually get the rib meat and chicken all in their freshly made half flower and half corn enchilada. Also, I highly recommend their corn bread as a side even though it costs a little extra, you will thank me later. There are many sauces and condiments available, so do not be scared to have the staff run through each ingredient with you as they usually do anyway. Also add an egg to your enchilada if you're feeling wild!"}
{"text":"Thought I would have dinner here, since I was in the area. I opted for enchiladas filled with braised short rib (so tender) & spinach n mushroom, Christmas style and topped with habanero lava, pickled onions and slaw.  It was very good.  The place is med size with outdoor seating.  The menu is simple: tacos, enchiladas and soup. The guys walk you through the process to build your meal, which is great if this is your first time, like me.  Quick and easy, will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I finally got to try this place and I was not disappointed. The enchiladas were phenomenal. Ordering was pretty easy and the guys behind the counter were friendly and willing to answer questions. The portions are big and I was able to take half of it home. Gadzooks is a great place for a quick, delicious meal."}
{"text":"Two enchilada: green chili pork and marinated chicken, red and green sauce, crema, cheese, pico and fried egg. Loved it! Two enchilada, beer and a coke for $14 and change, can't beat that. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch or a lite dinner. The service is great and friendly staff. My only complaint was the giant menu written high up on the wall, it puts a strain on your neck."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch potatoes are insanely good. Potato enchiladas, red sauce, guacamole, slaw, pico = heaven"}
{"text":"I love this place. So far I have been about 6 or 7 times. I always get the same thing, two 50/50 tortilla enchiladas with chicken, green sauce, both cheeses, pico, guac, and crema. The chicken is so flavorful, nice heat but not overwhelming. I also recently tried the mashed potatoes and they baked it in the same dish as the 'ladas. The potatoes are so good! I might try them as a filling some time if I can ever step away from that delicious chicken."}
{"text":"It's good.  It's like \"...a Chipotle for enchiladas\"  (which brings up the question, why doesn't Chipotle do enchiladas?)  It's just not a bargain.  I got two enchiladas, one bison, one green chili chicken.  With a drink, it was $9.    The bison was a whole lot of nothing.  Carolinas puts out a better machaca beef enchilada for, I think, $2.75.  The green chili chicken was delicious and had a nice zing to it.  And the \"Lava\" hot sauce was EVERYTHING IT SHOULD BE!  Flavorful, spicey, excellent.  What DID look REALLY delicious were the chopped salads.  Alright, \"a\" chopped salad, meaning the guy in front of me.  They piled everything for the salad in an enchilada bowl, dramatically dumped it out on a chopping board and then chopped it in front of you.  I saw this guy, the guy in front of me in line, on his way out the door, and I asked him, \"was it as good as it looked?\"    \"Better\", he said.  \"Friggin' GREAT salad!  Also, not inexpensive.  And by the way, \"half a spoon\" of guacamole, for $1, sucks.  I know avocados are expensive, but it's not worth it."}
{"text":"Incredible variety, fast service, Highly Recommended!  Food: As others have said, this is a Chipotle-style place (think build-your-own) that serves mainly enchiladas and tacos. But if enchiladas and tacos aren't your thing, you can build your meal using a different base, such as tortilla soup, poblano chilis, or a salad base. Since I wanted to go low-carb, but with some spice, I started with the poblanos. This was a good choice, then the difficulty comes in deciding what to add to the base - there are soon many options! To stuff my two poblanos, I finally selected green chile pork, and roasted tomatillo chicken - and they were awesome!! I topped them with \"Christmas\" sauce (red and green), chihuahua cheese (like cheddar), and pico. They put your creation through the oven to bake it and seal in the flavors, then you add the toppings.  The taste was amazing! And there are so many combinations to try! Yummy on steroids!  Cost: My two-poblano meal, with iced tea, was $10.43 including tax, which was very reasonable.  Service:  The staff were fast, although not very helpful in guiding me to the perfect enchilada.   Atmosphere: Ok, functional, but no booths or privacy.  Overall: Amazing flavors, so many options, I will definitely be returning again and again!!"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service with lots of smiles 8/25 @2:45pm. Thanks for the patience and recommendations"}
{"text":"This is a great little place offering an interesting take on the enchilada. Ordering is pretty much Chipotle-style, where you pick out your ingredients and toppings. However, the quality of the food far surpasses Chipotle, Cafe Rio or other similar places.   There are several ways to customize your enchilada, meats, sauces, cheeses and vegetarian fillings. You can also order a Poblano pepper stuffed with anything you want and served up enchilada style - absolutely delicious. They even have the option of throwing a fried egg on top, which is a must if you're looking for an authentic Southwest enchilada."}
{"text":"Had no idea what to expect.  It's set up almost like a subway of enchiladas.   Except..  They put your enchilada together with your choice of several difference really good meat choices, cheese etc.  then they add your choice of toppings and cheese - and then cook in little pans.  The result is awesome!  Love love love it"}
{"text":"Great concept, well executed! This unique, Chipotle-like counter approach lends itself well to their selection of wonderful foods. I had the soup - VERY hearty and comforting, great flavor and thickness. The enchiladas were also fantastic, the chioces, add-ons and sauces were spectacular!! I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Gadzooks is a mix between authentic Mexican food and Chipotle. In a create-your-own style dish you literally make your own enchiladas. It's phenomenal. Gadzooks has really revolutionized how I eat enchiladas. And who knew potatoes paired so well with Mexican food?!  Come here right now. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Really liked it.  Very fresh ingredients and a flavor profile you won't get from bigger chain stores.  I'll be back with reinforcements next time!"}
{"text":"Gadzooks was awesome. The menu is a little tricky to read on the ceiling before ordering, so look at the menu online before you come to help! I had 3 enchiladas and tried the short rib and pork. Both were delicious. My wife got a salad which was really cool - they put everything together in a big bowl, and then pour it out and chop up your salad. We will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"I like the location but the food leaves much to be desired. The food was bland and the service was mediocre. I would urge you to spare yourself the disappointment."}
{"text":"I drove past this place for months (literally) on the way to work. Was it the goofy name or the strange relationship between enchiladas or soup that caught me off guard? Finally, my curiosity got the best of me, and I'm glad that it did. First off, these suckers are filling and a pretty good value. I'm a big boy and 3 of these things loaded up and I'm ready for a nap. Quality is very good on the ingredients and I love being able to customize my enchilada. Of course I loaded those things up with short ribs ,eggs, cheese and got it toasted! I enjoyed it, but not quite as much as my fiancée who gave it a five star and she said it was a hit with the in-laws. Win."}
{"text":"Have been there several times and have never had a bad meal or bad service. The braised short ribs and pork is amazing accompanied with the their margarita so delicious. Have tried the enchiladas and tacos and prefer the tacos. My only complaint I have is its a little warm inside but they have an open fire oven. They do have a nice patio which is lovely in the cooler months."}
{"text":"I am generous with one star. Stopped in yesterday with high hopes."}
{"text":"I was just driving around looking for somewhere to eat and saw gadzooks. I remembered saving it to my bookmarks of places to try. Realistically I rarely ever get around to this list, so I had to take this opportunity to try it. First impressions upon walking in, it was loud (lots of people there) and I just assumed it was a cafeteria type line. I was right! Thankfully I was right. The menu is written up high. Take your time to go over it cause there are lots of choices.   The first guy was nice and could tell I was new to the establishment. He directed me on the process and what you can do for the enchiladas.   I love the 50/50 tortillas. They are a little thicker and are in between a tortilla and pita in density. I thought it was perfect. I heard you could mix the fillings too but I just stayed pretty standard. I got the braised short rib and green chili pork. The pork was moist and tender. Short rib was tender but a little dry. Their guacamole is okay, habanero salsa is good, the heat doesn't kick you right away. Wouldn't say it is unbearable either (especially for being habanero).   All in all go down the line and get what you think sounds and looks good. I wish I had a chance to try everything. Next time I plan on getting the works done to my enchiladas and a necessary fried egg ontop. I'm sad I didn't get one this time. Pretty sure I will be here later this week."}
{"text":"Tried this and loved it.  Lots of selections and the amazing choice to add an egg to any meal.  The green sauce is the perfect amount of spicy.  That jacked potato is perfect for any meal.  Add the green sauce and make a good meal great."}
{"text":"Gadzooks beats any chipotle or cafe rio! The rich enchilada sauce to the homemade tortillas. It was all so juicy, and yummy! It was a bit of drive for us but a 100% worth it. Great experience! I'm excited to go back for the next round of tacos and enchiladas. Super cute little joint, I loved the outside seating as well."}
{"text":"Lived up to the reviews & hype.  Absolutely amazing.  Owners of Jalapeños in Show Low told us this place is their fave when they are in the valley.  Unique presentation--pizza oven meets enchiladas.  Go for the $3 lada over two enchiladas.  Your taste buds will love Gadzooks!"}
{"text":"Short rib tortilla soup is amazing, as is the cornbread.  I have never had a bad dish here.  Everything is on the slightly spicy side.  Good food and a comfortable casual environment (order-at-the-counter style)."}
{"text":"Since my triumphant return to the valley of the sun, I had made a list of restaurants that were a must try and Gadzooks Enchiladas & Soup was at the top of that list! This place is similar to chipotle in concept but the quality of food doesn't even compare.   Being a newbie to the joint - I asked the guy behind the counter to make me what he usually eats. I think this is the best thing to do sometimes, It's fun to try things that other people recommend.   So of course I had to try the Enchiladas, I got one house corn and one made from scratch half n' half corn flour tortilla filled with green chilie prok shoulder and a sweet corn type filling in the other, I went christmas style and got the red and green sauce and asadero cheese, topped the sucker with a griddled fried egg and guac, salsa verde, with a little scratch made cream, crumbled cotija cheese, and pickled red onions!  Seriously delicious - and not pricey at all.... I can't wait for it to be soup weather so I can try their tortilla soup!   So, simply why should you come here?! - Fresh homemade ingredients - Huge portions, and great prices - Amazingly friendly and helpful staff - And there is booze  A must try!"}
{"text":"Updating from when I first ate here right after they opened: They definitely worked out the kinks and my husband and I are frequent customers! Hint--get the guac on top! It is really good guac!"}
{"text":"To quote my husband, \"damn, this place is GOOD!\"   And then he went back 3 times that week.  I was lucky enough to make the cut on one of his return trips, and all I can say is, \"Damn! That place IS good!\""}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  I've driven by many times not knowing what it was. Just think of it, chipotle style restaurant that serves enchiladas. Everything seems super fresh and high quality. It'll just be confusing your first time through the line, but it's worth it.   Go try it!"}
{"text":"So I too have been patiently waiting for this place to open, as I drive by it daily on my way to and from work. I have also been CRAVING Mexican food, and enchiladas and soup were top on my list to indulge in! I understand that this was their 2nd day open, and I also agree that staff was extremely friendly and informational, the owners brother was even there helping out!  On to the food - I order for myself and another person, we got the short rib, pork verde and cheese enchilada. Mine was topped with guacamole, his with the tomatilla salsa. As for the enchiladas themselves, they smelled amazing, but the taste was far from it! There was little to no flavor from the meat. I was charged an additional $1 for the guacamole (that I wasn't told about), but the guacamole was delicious. My friend said the tomatilla salsa was the best part of his order. We also got some chicken tortilla soup... again, nothing special! :( It was nothing to write home about!  Overall, I am very disappointed with the food and had extremely high expectations and was let down!!!"}
{"text":"So good! I went here today for the first time with my friend. I got two enchiladas (corn tortilla) one with short rib, the other with green chili pork. I got half red sauce, half green sauce, with jack cheese. I also got the sour cream type stuff on top. They were both absolutely delicious, and I can't wait to come back! The service wasn't the best I've ever had, but hey, I'm not going there to make friends, I'm going to eat delicious food!"}
{"text":"Went here a couple nights ago with a friend of mine from the area. I'm from Atlanta, all I was told is \"it's like chipotle but with enchiladas and soups instead\". I was not disappointed with the short rib taco at all! Going back tonight with my girlfriend! Can't wait!"}
{"text":"Yeah, not a huge fan. The price was okay. The enchiladas were okay (at best). The employees were okay. They seemed like bored robots. I wasn't quite sure how to order and they explained everything to me in a flat voice with a flat look on their face while looking over my shoulder. I wasn't asked if I wanted my order for here or to go and I only realized at checkout that they had made it in a container that was obviously not to go, so I had to have the checkout person put it in a to-go box which slowed down the line.   I sat at my desk at work and begrudgingly ate the food because I was hungry, but I made quite a few faces as I forced it to go down. It just tasted like a spicy-ish train wreck of flavors in my mouth. Won't be visiting again."}
{"text":"So excited to see new restaurants moving into district 4! Gadzooks is an amazing concept started by Aaron. I had their pork green chile and guajillo short rib \"chirstmas style\" enchiladas which means a combination of the red and green sauce. Its so cool to see them making the tortillas fresh in house and I absolutely loved their lava salsa which is so spicy but so good. Also the homemade guac is fresh and delicious. Cant wait to come back and try the bison."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots in Phoenix.  The tortilla soup is legendary and all of the toppings are delicious and generously offered. I always order a side of the cornbread.. its amazing!  The shortrib enchiladas are super flavorful. I've also tried the nachos, and they are enough for an entire meal.  Every time I go, my eyes are bigger than my stomach! The line gets really long at lunch time, so its better to hit this place up at an off time.  This is the type of place that has something for everyone, and no one will leave disappointed!"}
{"text":"Ah-mazing! Just left after eating there for the first time.  We tried you different kinds of enchiladas: pork and chicken, bought red and green sauces, and a plethora of toppings and ate a serving of the tortilla soup for good measure.   The winner in my books was the pork enchiladas with green sauce although the red sauce with its smoky flavors is on three list as well! The corn bread in the soup have it this amazing texture that isn't easily forgotten.    We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Yum. Full of flavor. I love their chips! Our kids eat here, but not their favorite place since its full of flavor."}
{"text":"Great food, but for goodness sake, GET SOME BLINDS! When the sun is setting it's like an ant sitting directly under a little boys magnifying glass. I see patrons trying to hold on to any bit of shadow available to shield their eyes. It's horrible!"}
{"text":"Driving through Phoenix and it happened to be lunch time. I was at the red light sitting at the intersection where Gadzooks is located, did a quick Yelp lookup and decided to try it. I'm glad I did, because it was really good. I had the 2 enchilada plate. One short rib and the other chicken tomatillo. Both were good. They are super stuffed with meat, no skimping. After choosing my tortilla, all corn for me. (U can choose a half corn half flour tortilla), pick your filling - they have meat and vegetarian options. Cheese and sauce topping. Then its put in the fire oven briefly to warm and melt the cheese. Choose salsa and other condiment toppings and voila (or olé! In this case)  I was there during the lunch rush. People were constantly streaming in and the line moved quickly and food served quickly. Friendly staff. Great food. Nice easy parking on site.   If you have little ones, there are booster seats and high chairs but no changing tables in the restroom.   Glad I took a chance on this place and would definitely try again! Maybe soup on a cold day in Phoenix...."}
{"text":"There's a reason this place was empty when we walked in. Don't let the adobe oven fool you, the corn tortillas are thick & flavorless, and the vegetarian options were just kind of pasty filling. I will say the salsas were descent but paying $9 for a single layer of nachos was insane and I'd rather eat Taco Bell. I know this sounds harsh, but as an AZ native, if you can't do Mexican Food properly and for a better price, there are at least a dozen taco trucks within walking distance that will."}
{"text":"I had veggie enchilada. It was delicious,  I'm always happy to see a good vegan iron on the menu. Great location,  trendy end of osborn. Outdoor seating will be great for our awesome Phoenix winter."}
{"text":"Really good food.  Fresh.  Yummy.  Get your enchiladas made exactly as you like them.  Check it out.  And like the guy in front of us in line said..make sure you order a side of cornbread.  It was good."}
{"text":"I had a 3 enchilada plate with jack cheese and Christmas sauce.  Short rib, pork, and mushroom spinach, with slaw and pickled onions on top.   The short rib was my favorite, followed by the pork. The spinach was a miss for me. No mushroom flavor. Only tiny bits among the spinach. But overall, the food was tasty.  I like the concept, but wish they had rice and beans as optional sides instead of just chips. I spent $14 on the enchiladas and drink but wasn't entirely filled up."}
{"text":"Honestly , it's overrated . Expected some spice and there wasn't any then the portion size is actually pretty small . It's a chipotle in a way expect I think i rather go to a taco truck then this .  They keep there food line pretty dirty and you couldn't tell what was what ."}
{"text":"Overall my experience at Gadzooks was a dissappointment. I had been excited to try this place for months.   First, the customer experience is extremely lacking. The place was so quiet. There was no music, no tvs; just the awkward sound of echoing conversation from the other patrons. Not the worst thing ever though. I stared at the menu for at least five minutes before any aknowledgement. Then, the only words from behind the counter were \"what are you getting?\" For a new place, a little helpful guidance or possibly some explaination would be great. Especially when the have several types of tortillas, meats, cheeses and sauces. I don't really know what I want yet, because I don't understand whats going on yet. everone was grumpy, except the gal at the cash register. ;/  Presentation was not great either. The ceramic dishes wer nice, sturdy and cooled quickly. The to-go packaging was really neat as well. What wasn't neat, was the soup dish. It was a cup. Like, a paper cup that you put a fountain soda in. Uh... that seems pretty ratchet. no soup bowls, or paper soup cups? Also, the food along the toppings line was just sitting in an empty steam/cooling table in what looked like storage containers. Also, they only have 2, very small trash cans that were almost un-noticeable. Napkins, straws, silverware: all seemingly happhazardly thrown in a divider next to the fountain.Did they rush to open so quick, that they cut a few corners? It defintiely seems like it. They probably should have waited another month, so that customers would have a genuine \"WOW' experience.  Next was the food. Simply put, I didn't like it. I can admit that the reason for this was no fault of the establishment, but my own personal tastes. It just wasn't my type. They definitely have some decent options but they were missing an obvious staple. BEEF! At least, I didn't see any, and as I stated earlier, the employees were less than helpful, so if there was a beef option with a zany nickname, I had no idea. The tortillas were either corn, or a corn/flour hybrid. I prefer flour, so they werent my favorite. The rating i am giving here is based 90% on my experience, not so much the food.  Final thought: After much built-up anticipation, I was underwhelmed when I got in, and left feeling hungry and frustrated. Hopefully, in a few months when I give it another shot, some noticeble customer service improvmnets will have been made."}
{"text":"I work at Chipotle. I came here after our Cultivate Festival in Scottsdale. I immediately felt familiar with the ordering process and was amazed at all the choices and even the fire oven! I got two enchiladas with some mashed potatoes. Ordering was simple as you walk down the line and tell them what you want inside, on the side, and on top. The food was every bit of delicious as I had hoped! They even had some homemade pumpkin-spice maple brown sugar cookies that were a great addition to the meal! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I really like the red and green sauce. The way they cook the enchilada like a pizza blends all the tastes together...It has a lot more overall taste than most quick food places...I think that they are on to something here...I would drive out of my way to eat there and the food matches the bill..."}
{"text":"Food is good but portions are small, service slow, place is loud and in the eve the sun rages through the all glass west facing wall [no blinds] Behind the counter chaos, got multiple orders wring"}
{"text":"The service was quick and helpful which is amazing because this place fills up fast! I mean fast!! By 11:20 there is a line to the door, which I understand because this place is amazing!   They have a wide selection of enchiladas, tacos and soups. You choose which meat or filling you would like. Next you choose something to smoother it with (yummy!) then you add any toppings you would like. I'm a sucker for enchiladas so of course that's what I got and it was amazing!!   Not only was the food great, but the atmosphere is chill and calm. They are playing radical face in the background for goodness sake :) love that group! I would definitely recommend this to anyone. Singles, teens, working adults, families and people with kids (they have high chairs, huge plus for moms with tots like me)."}
{"text":"Ok this place is now officially one of my favorite spots in town. Authentic, fast, clean, delicious, affordable and relatively healthy. It's the type joint you're proud to take out of towners to show off Phoenix cuisine."}
{"text":"Plain and simple this is one of the best in Phoenix! The experience is fun and creating my own food fix is the best!   There are an endless amount of combinations you can get and the staff really knows their food!"}
{"text":"My family loves this restaurant constantly bragging about the taste and uniqueness of the restaurant for the last three weeks. The night of the election we decided to take dinner home. You could imagine how excited I was until I found a rubber band in my chicken soup. So disappointed that this restaurant lacked quality control. See picture."}
{"text":"I don't really do Mexican food much. Boy, this place is #amazeballs . O. M. G. The in house hand made tortillas are addictive, the meat flavors are ridiculous. Wow!!!! #VeryImpressed glad am #NotLongerAVirgin"}
{"text":"This is now going to be one of my favorite places to go for lunch or dinner. Unique enchiladas for sure! They are in a perfect spot on 7th Street facing Starbucks! The place is very easy to spot , and there are plenty of space for parking. I had the Spicy cornbread enchilada with different sauces and avocado. It was tasty, filling and delicious! Next time, I'm going to try it with an egg. I'm so glad they opened it in this location since I'm in this neighborhood all the time."}
{"text":"In a nutshell, Gadzooks is to Enchiladas, what Chipotle is to Burritos... except the food at Gadzooks is better.   The first time I came here it was a -- let's test out how stressed Jon can get before passing out event. It was super loud, lots of people and I've never been a fan of the whole cafeteria line, create your own type of ordering systems... so there was that.   Confused and anxiety ridden, we shouted our order at the mostly friendly folks on the other side of the sneeze guard. They could surely tell we were newbs and taking into account how busy it was, they handled it nicely.   Frustrated, we made it down to the check out spot where the magic happened. They have the Coolest twine tying thingy (I'm pretty sure that's the manufacture name) that ties up your to-go order. It's so bad ass. That put a smile on my face after, to this point, an overwhelming experience.   We left thinking we may not go back again because the stress just wasn't worth it. Then we got home with our bounty and pretty much after the first bite knew that was a premature ruling. The place does good enchilada.   I'm no expert, in fact, I never ate much Mexican style food until moving to Phoenix a year ago, but these were top 10 in my world. Especially taking into account that it's fast-casual. Not too fancy, just good food.   We've been back a couple of times since our first visit and the ordering process gets easier as you get use to it. The food has been great each time, and the twine tying thingy never ceases to delight."}
{"text":"Cool concept for enchilada lovers, build your own!  Can't get much better.  Would have been five stars if I didn't have to step back and read the menu board above me every few seconds.    Staff are extremely helpful and friendly!  Hope this places catches on and opens over on the east coast."}
{"text":"Came here with the bf on a tip from our airbnb host, this place did not disappoint. Chipotle style setup with enchiladas, such a genius idea! I tried the 50/50 tortillas, chile verde, braised short ribs, the xmas sauce, pickled onion, guacamole, fried egg... I'm sure I'm missing something. It was very delicious. Great flavors, great concept, great food. Coming from LA I definitely have high expectations for Mexican food and I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Have been here a couple times, can't complain. It's similar to a fresher, tastier Chipotle. I was slightly taken back at how the portions seemed small, however halfway through the second enchilada it's well worth the money! Deceptively filling and very tasty."}
{"text":"I work across the street from Gadzooks and waited for it to open for what seemed like forever. I just got a chance to try it today. The staff greeted me right away and could tell I had never been (i assume) they explained how everything worked to make my 1st time easy. The process was not hard at all unless you can't make up your mind what you like. They do have many choices which can seem overwhelming, but I was brave and decided quickly. I got the braised ribs and green chille pork enchiladas with the christmas sauce and tried a little of all of the cheeses. They topped everything and melted it together in the wood oven. I have to say that I very much enjoyed it and was a great experience. The food was very good and the place is very nice and clean. Will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"After finding somewhere with a four star rating and over 500 reviews I knew I had to try it out. I came here for a solo lunch while my boyfriend was hard at work for national guard drill.  Once you walk in its very similar to a chipotle with the ordering style. The downside is nothing is labeled so you have to keep pointing and asking, \"what's that?\" The bright side is all of the combinations and toppings. I went with two enchiladas, one chicken and one pork on corn tortillas. For toppings I went with the red and green sauce, jack cheese, slaw and jalapeño ranch. In the end I really liked the pork best. The chicken seemed a bit dry for me. As for the sauces I was tied between the red and green. I can recommend getting the slaw though, that was my favorite out of all the toppings. It gives the enchiladas that little bit of crunch they need.  Overall I'm really glad I tried this place out and would definitely come back to try some other dishes. I do advise getting there early since it tends to get pretty busy around 12:30 and there's somewhat limited seating."}
{"text":"This place is really really good. I was blown away with how much I liked this place. I wish I would have known about this place before. The quality and all the toppings make this place so unique. Pickled onions, slaw, 3 different salsas all fresh. Very clean restaurant and kitchen. I wish the built another location closer to my house. If you going with a baby I'll let you know that there are only 2 high chairs and last night I had to wait for one."}
{"text":"I love coming here, especially when it's cold out! The fire-cooked enchiladas warm me to my core and the flavors are phenomenal! All the ingredients are laid out for you to see, allowing you to customize your enchilada or taco. It can get pretty noisy, so be sure to speak up so the servers can hear you! The staff is fantastic and always project a pleasant attitude. The food may take some time to cook, but it's pretty quick considering it's all put together fresh to your specifications!"}
{"text":"After finding out we didn't have time to go to one of the places originally on my list before heading to the airport, we found this place after a quick yelp search. And I'm glad we did. Like chipotle for enchiladas, but much, much better. I got the chicken enchiladas with all the trimmings and it was pretty darn good. I only wish we had one of these in NY, as the concept is awesome."}
{"text":"Spotted this place a few weeks back while driving down 7th St.....Last night we thought we would check it out...  The overall look of the place reminds me of Chipolte...."}
{"text":"Food-ok.  Not terrible, not overwhelmingly great either. As a couple of other posters have said, your two enchiladas end up tasting the same after coming out of the oven ( this isn't a factor if you got each enchilada made the same way, but obviously if you have different fillings, meats, and toppings on each, it IS something to consider).  This was my first visit.  No short rib meat, they said it would be available in an hour or two.  This is a huge pet peeve of mine. How do you just \"run out\" of what is in fact your main ingredients that you advertise right up top on the menu? I get that stuff happens, but I've never understood this in the restaurant business.  Isn't it someone's  job to monitor the meat, coke, utensils, salt, lettuce, whatever the ingredient is, and order more when it gets low? Or at least SHOULDN'T it be, someone's job? Isn't the idea to be able to time it and plan so there is some overlap and you're never just sitting there \"out\" of something for a few days or even hours? I have no sympathy when this happens because it's easily avoidable with the right kind if oversight and forethought.  Their receipt roller/machine also wasn't working, no receipt.  Not a huge deal, but also not a great first impression thing either.  Also, no  inclusion of silverware with my to-go order, after I had already indicated it was \"to go\".  There may be plastic utensils there in the restaurant I could have grabbed, I don't know. It was my first time and no one mentioned that, and I didn't notice the lack of included utensils until I got home.  The food is what it usually comes down to, right? As I mentioned, the food here isn't bad, isn't great.  The price of $7.25 isn't bad for what you get (two enchiladas).  The pumpkin cookies  at the register are good, but the fact that you HAVE to buy two at a time ($1.80) and cannot buy one seems wrong. Two of these for $2 (with tax) seems like a bit of a stretch.  Atmosphere was fine, the place was also clean and the  service/attitude if the staff was  fine.  This place is ok.  The Yelp rating description for two stars \"Meh.  I've experienced better\" is right on target here."}
{"text":"I've only been during busy times. Food is great, however, the line is chaotic and they never have poblano peppers and say it will be 20 min to prepare.  I'd recommend going during non-peak lunch and dinner hours."}
{"text":"Very neat concept. I've been several times. The problem I have is the spice. I love spicy and can tolerate a lot but for some reason this place gives me tons of heartburn so I don't go as often as I'd like. I like to describe this place as like a Chipotle but for enchiladas. I've never seen soup and I had a hard time finding it on the menu. I'll try looking for it next time I go. Also, plan on paying around $12-15. The price is a little steep for a couple of enchiladas. All of my petty critiques aside, give it a try if you're in a hurry. It's not bad. Seating is limited though so if it's already 100+ out you better eat fast."}
{"text":"My classmate and I decided to come here, just to try.. So we walked in, ordered the chicken and short rib enchilada with Christmas sauce (red & green). I also ordered sweet & spicy corn on the side because it looked good. The people behind the counter were nice. It was like a chipotle style, you pick what you want on your enchilada. So I picked the home made sour cream, pico de gallo and cotija cheese and then they put it inside the brick oven. The enchiladas were okay, I expected a wet juicy enchiladas.. But it was dry. The meat also needs flavoring and it was also dry. Oh and the sweet & spicy corn was really spicy."}
{"text":"During our road trip, I was craving enchiladas the entire time. Maybe it was the Arizona heat or the bright red-orange rock on the roads, but I was destined to get some enchiladas in Phoenix.  Lucky for us, after a day in the museum, we made a stop at Gadzooks after seeing its great reviews! We were hesitant, since a \"make your own\" enchilada sounded a bit too Chipotle for us. However, it turned out amazingly delicious and we agreed 100% we would come back if ever back in Phoenix. The only thing similar to Chipotle is the style of how you order. The menu is large at the entrance. You basically choose your style--enchilada or taco. I really wanted my cheesy enchiladas, so I went with that. Their proteins are THE BEST. SO vege-friendly! I was curious about the jackfruit, but settled for one spinach and mushroom and the other with cornbread. Holy crap, their cornbread is out of this world. The spinach I could do without, so maybe next time I'll try the jackfruit.   They also have the option to add an egg, which we both did (cuz BAKED EGGS ARE HEAVENLY). I love that they have as many toppings as you want. We even mixed both of the sauces--try them both because they are delicious. The toppings are all so yummy and I honestly could not WAIT to dig into my enchiladas. They shove your creations into like a wood-fire oven similar to how pizza is made (if made right!) and if your order took a while like ours, they bring it out to you. The service by all of the workers here is fast and friendly! I think we had some younger service folks working that day, and they were so awesome. Plenty of seating outside as well as inside. Parking was not a problem with a private plaza. I loved Gadzook's!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. Think Chipotle for enchiladas. Nice patio, plenty of room inside. The food is really amazing. The prices are great. If you're not in the area it's actually worth the trip.   I ordered 2 chicken enchiladas. I'll be back to try the tacos!"}
{"text":"Good food worst service. Everytime we have been here servers are just rude.   Enchiladas are really good, my beau tried naked enchiladas with buffalo and chicken for low carb lovers. I  tried flour tortilla chicken with spinach half and half. Food is good but servers just spoil whole mood."}
{"text":"I ate there yesterday and I think they have fixed the problems other users had below.  The menu is simple and they explained it to me as soon as I got there.  It's basically tacos, enchilades and soup. I didn't try the soup.  You have a choice of made to order corn or flour tortillas. Then they fill it with choice of fillings. I highly recommend the shortrib but the green chile chicken was very good too. Then you choose toppings like picked onions, pico de gallo, enchilada sauce, crema & cheeses.  Everything is really fresh and delicious. I also tried the guac which was fantastic.  The entrees are less than $7, so you can actually eat lunch for under $10, which is great.  The concept seems similar to, but a step above, Chipotle.  In fact, I liked it so much that I was craving it and actually went back again today.  The employees both days were very helpful and asked if I'd had a good experience.  Frankly, it was an excellent lunch and I have no complaints. I will go there often. If you had a bad experience, I think it is worth a second chance!"}
{"text":"Both the food and customer service here is fantastic! We came in for the first time 30 minutes before closing and they described every topping for us without seeming the slightest bit annoyed, even though they had began their closing tasks (which is more than I can say for most other places). I got the chicken enchiladas and they were probably the best I've ever tasted! I will definitely be visiting this place again some time soon"}
{"text":"Hubby drives all over the Valley everyday and he kept seeing how busy Gadzooks was so on his day off we went.  Mmmmmm, glad we did.  He had ribs and spinach mushroom enchiladas and I had green chili pork.  I have been back with my sister and when our cousin comes down at the end of this month we are taking her there!  Good food, spicy but not heartburn spicy.  Lots of sauce and topping choices too."}
{"text":"The food is good and the service was good too. I ordered the short ribs and green chile pork enchiladas. They both were good but I like the green chile pork the best. They place reminds of chipotle but with enchiladas. For real authentic Mexican food this might not be the place but it is still great option over Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Been here once before but forgot to write a review and it was so good I had to come back just so I could write a review! :) so I got two enchiladas one short rib and the other green chili pork! Both are extremely phenomenal!! They have three different sauces to choose from either Verde (green mild) medium and hot, I have only tried the verde so far but I'm sure they are all delicious"}
{"text":"Pretty cool place! Great customer service, friendly staff, neat idea of the way its set up, build your own enchiladas! The only thing I would want to change a little is to add rice and beans to the enchiladas (like on the side) I love enchiladas but I need a little more variety. Eating a huge bowl of just enchiladas gets a little bland. Other than that, definitely recommend it for people to try!"}
{"text":"First time here.  Kind of Chipotle-like in how you make your selections and assemble your enchliada bowl.  Lots of selections (chicken, short rib, bison IIRC)...choices of toppings, cheeses, sauces.   Made for a tasty lunch"}
{"text":"Great flavor profiles, with local places like this it is clear to see Chipotle has become a tired restaurant concept."}
{"text":"This place was YUM.  I threw this place immediately on my list when I drove by a few months ago. My kids had to use the potty and we just got back from LA. Maybe I was hungry, but let's be real. Mexican food is always delicious. And then you go ahead and tell me I can have enchiladas?   Just. Yes.  It's kind of like Chipotle in that you select your item (soup, salad, enchiladas, tacos) and then you go through each station to tell them what you want. But then there's the magic part.  They take your perfect creation and put it in a quick pizza oven rotation that makes the cheese all perfect bubbly brown. THEN, you top it with slaw, salsas, and pickled onions if you want (which you do, promise).  I went with the cornbread filling (which is broken up and mixed cornbread with green chilis and other happiness mixed together. On my second one, I chose spicy potatoes as my filler (OMG) and topped it with \"Christmas\" red and green.   This place is a dream for me. I love me some enchiladas and I got to have them, quick and fast and customized. I topped with their crema (fancy for sour cream) and stuffed my face.  The chips are fresh made and the guac is too-- but if you're not into the chunky with jalapenos and onions, I'd steer clear-- my daughter wasn't a fan, but that just meant COME TO MAMA."}
{"text":"Gadzooks! YAY! Initially I was a bit leery of the \"redefining the enchilada\" slogan. I thought, \"I do not want to \"redefine the enchilada, I love enchiladas just the way they are.\" However, I was extremely surprised & thrilled by Gadzooks. The tortillas are made fresh & onsite, as are all the menus items. Although, the menu is posted high on the wall & the restaurant is run buffet style, do not be discouraged. Gadzooks makes the best enchiladas & tacos! Each order is personalized to the specific likes of the customer. There are a multitude of options for the vegetarian set & all of them are delicious!  I've yet to try their soups, but I hear they are fantastic. The staff is kind, and helpful and they know their products well. Although, busy during the lunch time rush, Gadzooks is well worth the wait. I know the owner is the first one there in the morning & the last to leave. Thus, showing great pride in a very unique concept. Go! Go! GO!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Can't wait to go back. Only thing was that a lot of the menu was spicy but I managed to come away with a dish that was flavorful and not spicy. Pork enchiladas. Ate it so fast forgot to take a pic"}
{"text":"What is Gadzooks trying to do? Make a better restaurant than Chipoltle? Well they succeeded! And that is no easy task.  I love Gadzooks! The fresh and different ingredients. The corn or flour tortillas uniquely Gadzooks. Tacos just as good as the enchiladas. And freshly melted cheese in the oven. I feel sorry for employees having to constantly stick their arms in a super hot oven but my stomach thanks you! I could go on and on about the incredible tacos and enchiladas, but I just have two words...tortilla soup! I get it every time and it's super bueno! Took my wife to Gadzooks for the first time on her day off and impressed the heck out of her! Happy wife equals a happy husband!  The Decor is spiffy too. Really nice illustration on the wall of a giant enchilada that actually helps explain their ingredients. It's these little well thought out details that makes The Gadzooks name synonymous with quality!"}
{"text":"Good food fun vibe.  Bison and short rib enchiladas, very good.  Lava sauce actually hot!! Bueno Buebo.   Small parking lot but a must try."}
{"text":"Tell me why they dont have a location in southern California? !?!  This is the chipotle of enchiladas! !! How much better can it get?   I got 2 enchiladas with green sauce. Ine was potato  (my fave) and the 2nd was brisket. They were fire grilled in a neat ceramic looking plate bowl. Absolutely delicious!   I will for sure come back!"}
{"text":"Hello, would you like to know the secret of life? If you worship at the temple of the almighty carb (which I am wont to do and really need to stop making a habit of), here you go:  Mashed potatoes. Inside an enchilada.  I could basically stop there, because what the hell else do you need to know?! But some more deets:  I ordered 2 enchiladas in their 100% corn tortillas (pressed in front of our own eyeballs!), one filled with the mushroom/spinach mixture, one with the godly mashed potato filling.  I picked \"Christmas style\" (both red and green sauces) because WHY NOT! Although I am an avid verde lover, so I think I'll go full on green sauce next time.  Asadero cheese.  Pico. Picked red onion.  HEAVEN.  We split some chips/salsa/gaucamole on the side, because you might as well go all out. The food was stupid, in the best way possible. I like a little golden to my cheese (all pizzas/cheese-topped foods in my house get a 30 broiler blast at the last cooking minute), and was pleasantly surprised when my little 'lada bowl came out of their oven just like that. Perfect! The mixture of toppings was superb.  The only recommendation I can give is to perhaps put a label of what's what on the front see-through guard as people order. There are a lot of fillings/toppings/salsas/extras and it was a little awkward to have to step back and look immediately above my head and strain to see all the details of what I could order. If anything, it could make the employees' lives easier.  Last word: Pumpkin cookies. Get them. See how life changes for the better."}
{"text":"Im rating this on a vegetarian stand point so for you meat eaters the experience will probably be different. That being said, i also thought that the overall quality of the food is not so great. For vegetarians there is only one filling option, sauteed spinach and mushroom and it is kind of like baby food in texture. The red sauce has chicken broth init. I got 2 corn enchiladas. The enchiladas themselves were bland. Ifi hadnt added extra quacomole, coleslaw, cheese, crema, and salsa to it, it would have been very boring. Pretty much youre paying for the toppings. If youre vegan you are even more limited. You could only have salsa and guacomole and onions. The chips and salsa though were really good. I could have made a whole meal out of the chips. The service was great. The person serving me was very kind about taking me through it step by step and making sure i got vegetarian items. So i wont be going back. No point in paying for guacomole and salsa and cheese and chips and stuf when I could make that all myself or get it all from safeway or something in bulk for the same price."}
{"text":"First time and it was delicious! Tried the tomatillo chicken with cornbread enchilada, flame broiled, then covered in salsa. It was a must try. Tasted the bison and that too was moist and tasty! I will be coming back to try other custom experiences!"}
{"text":"We stopped here on out way to the airport and it was great. Imagine Chipotle but 100x better. It was a Saturday, so it is hard for me to comment on the parking or the seating, though it was full and we sat outside in the misters. I had a cornbread enchilada with green salsa and cheese and it was perfect. Too bad no Gadzooks in MA."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!  Food is always as fresh as can be, served in piping hot dishes and so filling. Great beer selection in bottles and the chips and gauc are do die for. I will be coming here for a long time ...Did I hear franchise???"}
{"text":"I have lived in the valley for 23 years and this is one of my absolutely favorite top 3 restaurants in the city. It's fast casual, chipotle style enchiladas but every ingredient is made from scratch right in front of you.   The food has incredible depth of flavor. Every component has been flawlessly executed every time I have been here.   The ambience is casual and often very crowded. The owner is almost always running around and is super friendly."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. Lots of variety and sitting. I ordered 2 Enchiladas 1green chili pork and 1 potato. They covered it with Jack cheese and then placed it in a pizza oven so it would get hot and bubbly. Then I dressed it with lettuce, pico, sour cream, and guac. Got a side of chips too. The chips are like the good ones you would get freshly made from a Mexican supermarket almost. Everything was yummy. Well priced around $8-$10 a person. Only down fall was the line out the door."}
{"text":"Ate at Gadzooks twice.  The first time left me in a gaseous aftermath which we shall never speak of.   Note to self:  no.  pickled.  onions.  The second time, I got the poblano pepper stuffed with spinach and mushrooms.  By itself the spinach/mushroom is rather bland so I had the peppers topped with pico de gallo and guac.  These were the only two toppings from my first visit that I liked.  I also got a side of the spicy cornbread.  (Tasty!)  They were out of cookies and chips that evening.   Note to restaurant:  Make. Extra.   Duh!  I enjoyed my meal, and even though the colors looked lovely on my palette (platter), only the spinach/mushroom item appealed to my palate.  So I would order the same thing every time.  Won't be eating here often."}
{"text":"When we ordered, the girl at the counter picked up right away we were vegetarian. She then proceeded to tell us the red sauce had a chicken stock in it, but the green sauce doesn't. Who does that??!? Kudos to her and her knowledge of the menu!! The food was great and I found a new place to frequent!"}
{"text":"I highly enjoy this place. You get a lot for a decent price. The layout is similar to subway and chipolte where you make your own thing with what you want, but in this case with ENCHILADAS! You can pick between corn and 50/50 corn and flour. Honestly i wasnt expecting them to be so good. I ordered 2 and really i only needed 1. I tried their tacos as well which were amazing too. Again i got 2 tacos and really that was enough.  Tacos 4/5 Enchiladas 5/5 Short rib meat 5/5 Chicken 4/5 Pork 3/5 Cornbread 5/5 - fill your enchilada with this! Best ever.  Its a nice mellow hangout spot and i will be back because the food is so good!"}
{"text":"Not usually an enchilada fan but I don't know what I've been missing all these years!!! I decided to try the short rib enchiladas, tried both sauces, and one flour, one corn, both cheeses. They cooked them right in front of me in the open oven. I put cabbage, sour cream, guac, and green sauce on top among other options...WOW! Fantastic food. Or maybe I'm a fantastic chef??? You def need to stop by here...Chipotle watch out for Gadzooks!!!"}
{"text":"I was just as disappointed the second time around if not more. Everything is just so overly sour but not flavored.  It sits supers heavy and you end up smelling like onions and shit all day.  Thanks, but no thanks."}
{"text":"This was perfect after a long flight (long meaning an hour flight on an empty stomach. Don't do that ever!) obviously it as my first time and the worker helped me thru it all. First of all 50% corn 50% flour tortillas whatttt. Cornbread filling Whattt . Totes recommend! I also got the short rib and tried the green chile pork. Both equally good but short rib was off putting after a while. Also ordered the soup which comes with a heaping pile of meat and cheese on top. Everything goes into an oven which reminds me of chipotle/pieology. Actually it's pretty much the same exact concept but no complaints there! I don't usually like lots of options or decision making but this was Straight forward. Tortilla meat sauce cheese toppings more cheese more sauce. Hell yes! Yum Hit the spot"}
{"text":"Good assembly-line, fast-casual dining for a menu item that's often an afterthought in Mexican establishments. Come hungry, and prepared to make *a LOT* of choices. There are around 8 different fillings, ranging from vegetarian stuff to chicken to even bison. You can also pick from a myriad of toppings like guac, cotija cheese, or their ranch dressing, which I would say has absolutely no business here if not for the novelty of being made from goat's milk. Curiosity will get the best of me on that one!   Anyway, I ordered a bison enchilada with red *and* green sauce (\"Christmas\" style), jack cheese, guacamole, and pickled onions. I mean, just look at the picture I took! You know you want to stuff your face with that.   And if for some reason you don't share my amazing taste, you'll find something in here that's right for you. And it won't break the bank. And it won't take long. Like seriously, you can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Everyone was super friendly and up going. Food was delicious. Too bad the serving size was a bit on the skimpy side plus they were all out of their \"special\" of the day"}
{"text":"Poor experience solely because of the service. When we walked in we were very excited because we had heard good reviews but weren't really sure how everything worked. We told the staff upfront that we had never been in and we hoped to get a better understanding of how to build our meals. The girl behind the counter just said \"Um, we have tacos and enchiladas and stuff.\" And flags down another employee to help her explain who then gives us only the most basic explanation of the process. The staff is very young and lacks proper knowledge about the ingredients in the food that they are serving. Wish I could leave this place a better review because our food was delicious and the price was fair. Management needs to step it up with training."}
{"text":"I really like the concept of this place. It is so convenient yet delicious."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!! I used to live about 5 minutes walking distance away and watched this place while it was under construction turn into this! Now I drive almost 30 minutes! All of the staff is welcoming and friendly. If there is a long line, don't be alarmed because it moves quickly! Not to mention the food is delicious! Gadzooks is great for lunch and dinner. With great food, great prices, and a vegetarian selection you can't go wrong! :)"}
{"text":"Love the concept of Gadzooks! Delicious choices! Food was piping hot. I tried a spinach mushroom enchilada and a pork enchilada, Christmas sauce, cabbage, guacamole and pico. Threw a fried egg on too!Yum!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Saw the pictures on yelp and had to stop by. The food is great! I wish this place was on the east coast!"}
{"text":"First of all I hate giving local businesses bad reviews but after going to this place twice I had to review it.  I know they are not known for their nachos but I love nachos and when I was told they had good nachos I wanted to try it asap. The first time I got chicken nachos. They were covered in Chicken. I could not taste the chips, cheese, guac, because it was just all chicken. They give few chips. Literally I picked off a pile of chicken on a plate and I still had more than I knew what to do with in the nachos. I kind of wrote the place off because the nachos were almost inedible.   Then comes tonight. I was craving nachos again. They are so close that I figured I would give it another shot and just get them vegetarian this time. Again they were skimpy on chips, when I said no meat they did not offer any beans or anything to substitute the beans. So I got the guacamole again which they charged me extra for. When I got the total I asked if I was charged the same as with meat and the unsmiling person ringing me up said yes. Not only did I get charged the same as I would have with a pile of meat on my nachos but they charged me extra for guac! A few chips and some cheese should not cost 9 dollars. I can go to Tico's and get vegetarian nachos with veggies, beans, guac, etc for a similar price and they are twice as large.   The cheese was completely hard and there was more pico than chips. Really unimpressive.  They could learn something from chipotle and give the vegetarians their guac for free if they are going to charge them for the meat they are not eating.  Never again."}
{"text":"Heard about this place from a podcast. Walked up and thought the building looked great. Walked in and felt like I was in Chipotle. I ordered 2 chicken enchiladas, adding cheese, guacamole and cabbage. It was great. Me and my friends really enjoyed this place. Very tasty. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite spot . I usually don't find good enchiladas but I have to say this place is the best at making them .... #1"}
{"text":"This is as good as gets. I have dubbed this place my new go to for mexican food. Although all they serve is enchiladas and soup. Because you build your own the combinations are endless. The Bison is fricken delicious! I would have never thought that it tastes so good and they almost always sell out of it. There chicken tortilla soup is sublime. The best I have ever tasted hands down. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place many times. I think they have a delicious  take on enchiladas is one of a kinda, i also fell in love with the jalapeno corn bread. I have taken a few friend's here as well and they enjoyed it.. Great workers, great food, nice place."}
{"text":"Loved the pork with cornbread on half n half tortillas!! Very friendly staff that walk you through the ordering process by explaining all options and ingredients in toppings."}
{"text":"Ice machine was down and my coke was flat. The food, however, was great! Got that Tortilla soup with the chicken just like the friendly kid behind the food bar recommended. Threw some mix cheese on top. Got a side of that cheesy potato for a buck twenty five, I also got a poblano pepper. I'm not going to lie, it was pretty bomb. Good job Gadzooks, I'm going to have to be a little hungrier to try that enchilada combo next time."}
{"text":"Love this place! Whenever I introduce Gadzooks to a newbie, they always say \"oh, it's like Chipotle\" and I want to slap them. But I don't have to... the potato corn chowder will do it for me. (It's my fave)  Everything has such amazing flavor! Try mixing the cornbread and pork inside your enchilada! Top it Christmas style & don't forget the guac!"}
{"text":"I finally got to try this new neighborhood joint. It was GREAT. The staff was enthusiastic and gracious, the price was reasonable (even a bit low given the quality of the food), and the food was fantastic. Hand-crafted tortillas, custom-built, fire baked enchiladas with a multitude of fillings, amazing sauces, and killer soup means I will be back.   I had 2 enchiladas with spinach-mushroom filling, the smoky red sauce, and topped with pickled onions, slaw, and 3-chile vinaigrette. I also had soup with no meat and added a dollop of super-flavorful mashed potatoes.   If you go right at noon on a weekday, expect the lunch crowd crush to make parking and eating in a challenge. I got there at 11:45 and had no trouble.   If I were trying to grab a quick lunch with a friend during work, I would probably be prepared to send one person in to place a to-go order while the other person drives around the block.   Support this little gem. The building has been empty for so long, and I hear rumor that a Qdoba or ZTejas is being built right across the street. It is up to the locals to keep local options alive!  PS please consider adding packs of a dozen tortillas to go to your menu. I would definitely buy them to have at home."}
{"text":"[A version of this review will also be featured on the Holy Taco Church at http://www.holytacochurch.com/.]  Gadzooks! Enchiladas and Soup is a new place that I keep seeing mentioned on all the best-foods-in-Phoenix type lists.  I ordered two tacos. My husband ordered enchiladas. I chose the \"50/50,\" meaning half flour and half corn tortillas--this ended up being a good choice, because my husband went with corn and found they became extra toasty in the oven.   Next up... MEAT. I was a bit confused about if I could combine meat with another non-meat main item, and it turned out I could.  I chose to do two chicken and cornbread tacos. Cornbread. YES. Scooped out of a big casserole pan. Yelp said it was delicious, so I wanted to give it a shot!  With my tacos girded with chicken and chunks of cornbread, my food moved on down the food bar. Me, I love me some cheese, and here I asked for asadero and chihuahua cheese. My whole dish was stuck in the big oven to heat up for like two minutes as I waited and drooled. Next up, I asked for pico, crumbled cojita cheese (because cheeeeeeeese), vinaigrette slaw, and pickled onions. At this point, the dish looked like a delicious rainbow of awesomeness.  I asked for a pumpkin cookie and was pleased that the order included two. BONUS COOKIE FTW. They also had lemon blueberry cookies and I'd love to try those sometime.  So, cornbread on a taco. Dude. This is amazing. Cornbread tastes awesome but it also has this soft/crunchy texture thing going on. It melds with the meat. Clouds opened up. Angels sang. Cornbread is good with everything on a Thanksgiving plate, and it totally works with zingy Mexican flavors. I need to try this combo at home.  The food was 100% awesome. Every topping I chose was fabulous. The slaw and onions added a tang and crunch that nicely complemented the holy fusion of cornbread and chicken.  My husband had a short rib and a pork enchilada. He was pleased. I asked for bites of his food to judge this. Well, it was more like a mugging. My fork loomed over his plate and he wisely surrendered the dish before I stabbed him. I agreed with his assessment.  Meanwhile, our son had tortilla chips. They are awesome, all covered with bubbles, and thick enough that they can crackle and kinda explode when you bite into them. You could tell they are made there.  Then we come to the cookies. The glaze on them turned out to be maple. MAPLE! Happiness! Rainbows! Fuzzy kittens! The cookies really tasted like homemade and were soft and chewy.  We loved Gadzooks. Awesome food with great options. Good prices ($6.95 to get two tacos or two enchiladas). It's earned all the buzz."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place would need another review; but, just in case there is someone out there who doesn't believe the other 300+ reviews Gazooks is a great little place right Uptown for a quick lunch. And a good one. This was my first visit and we got there just as they opened at 11, so there was no line. By the time we had scarfed down our lunches, the line was out the door and the parking was practically non-existent. My recommendations, if you are thinking of trying Gadzooks for lunch, is to:   * Come early or late - not during the lunch hour (they close at 8pm)  * Walk from the office - parking is at a premium   * Get the enchilada with an egg on top  * Try the Christmas Chile Sauces - not exactly New Mexican, but still good  * The cookies are a good finish to your meal"}
{"text":"Had one of the worst restaurant experience in a long time.   I was in line for over 25 minutes.  When I finally got to the cashier I ordered a margarita.  She asked if I wanted anything else.  She didn't get my enchiladas.   Then she charged me double. She didn't know how to void the transaction so gave me a cash refund.  Then they didn't give me the drink because they were out of glasses.  They asked for me to wait for another customer to finish his drink then they'd wash the glass  The manager offered a gift certificate, but never delivered.  My advice, stay away."}
{"text":"Oh dear GOD! This place is so amazing. I seriously don't know how the lines aren't out the door and around the corner! My sister lives nearby and she demanded that we try it. Boy, was she right when she said it's like an orgasm in your mouth! Can you say QUALITY?!?! I feel like this is what I expected at Gallo Blanco but was disappointed. First of all, the tortillas are extremely fresh; considering they start with a ball of dough and flatten/cook it right on the grill in your face!! The three of us shared 4 tacos, 2 pork and 2 beef, half corn/half flour, with red AND green sauce; plus an enchillada with a fried egg on top!! I literally could not stop eating.  We somehow stopped ourselves from being super fatkids and took home some leftovers (portions are pretty generous). Still superb as a leftover btw. The staff was super nice, can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This little gem came highly recommended and having craved \"Mexican\" for weeks, I drove down with my son, who is always up for a food adventure and bound to give an honest opinion. We both tried the enchiladas Christmas style, both preferred the red to the green sauce. They were both good, but the green was a little more tart than I like and a little less heat driven than I like. I  had the corn tortillas with green chile pork and one with the cornbread. The tortillas held up nicely and tasted fresh. The GCP was good, didn't jump out at me but had decent flavor and was tender. The cornbread enchilada? That was like dessert, in a good way. I could probably eat nothing but the cornbread and be happy. I'm not a huge fan of piling on toppings and went simple with just cheese and the slaw. I had also been warned that two tacos or enchiladas was plenty of food and it's easy to get too much on top and not be able to finish your meal. That seemed like a horror to me, lol. The slaw added a nice crunch to the food, was slightly sweet from the honey and didn't try to compete with any of the other flavors. My son also had the GCP and loaded his with cheese, red & green, fried egg, pico and guac. He was very satisfied with all of his selections and said he would definitely go back to mix and match in the future.  About the mix and match- this is definitely part of the appeal and helps you get a unique experience. Note, which would have been helpful to us- You can put as many fillings as you want in a taco or enchilada. Hmmmm. I definitely see some variations in the future.   The salads were large and chopped freshly for each customer. This is an interesting twist on just getting greens with stuff on top.   Gadzooks is a bit of a drive but definitely worth it. It was very busy on a Friday at lunch time. I would guess there were 15 people in front of us and the tables appeared full inside and out, but the line moved quickly, the tables were bussed quickly and we were able to find a spot indoors. Also, be advised that there is additional parking to the east of the building, some covered, some open air."}
{"text":"My husband and I just stopped by on a whim for breakfast, and oh how glad we are that we did! Their breakfast tacos gave me the best bite I've had in a long while, and beat the watery eggs and tame salsas of the breakfast tacos you can get in Texas. Chile speckled mashed potatoes are mixed with the meat of your choice (I highly recommend the shredded beef), placed on a flat top to crisp everything up, scrambled with an egg and put in a tortilla (get the corn) and into the oven with cheese to get extra toasty. You can (and definitely should) top it with any of their many salsas, homemade crema, and veggies. It was so worth the trip and we will definitely be back to enjoy them again!"}
{"text":"Soooo freaking great! Think chipotle, you choose an enchilada, taco, chopped salad or tortilla soup, add the homemade INCREDIBLE meat and extras and boom you've got an iron chefs version of chipotle for close to the same price! And the grapefruit margarita was unreal!!"}
{"text":"Have you passed the shuttered Miriam's Designer Clothes building on North Seventh Street. Well now it's called Gadzooks specializing in enchiladas and soup.  The idea comes courtesy of Aaron Pool, a 25-year-old native of Phoenix and ASU grad who, thanks to fond memories of cooking with his mom. And maybe watching too much Seinfeld.  I spoke to Aaron and his little brother. Aaron says he's been in love with Mexican food since he was a kid, especially enchiladas, little brother wants a raise.  I tried three enchiladas. You get two and as an option you can \"add-a lada\" so I got three. First you need to pick a bread. I did corn tortillas because I love the gritty texture of corn, Now you need to pick a meat. I got chicken, bison, rib. Then you pick enchilada sauce. I did \"the rainbow\" three distinct sauces. Then it's time for cheeses, there are a few, I tried them all. The medium size deep dish gets shoveled into a brick bake oven. I added a few extras like avocado and a couple other goodies.  Pool said. \"Our goal is to redefine the enchilada\" He like many of us have gone to many so called Mexican restaurants where they are using frozen meats, prepackaged tortillas, flavorless sauces, or edible plastic cheese.  I'm tellin ya, my mother cooked enchilada dinners and she would have loved these."}
{"text":"Great place to eat!  The enchiladas, sauces, and meats were awesome!  The cornbread was delicious also. Will definitely go back!!!"}
{"text":"I want to start by saying the food is EXCELLENT. Parking is really awful - during weekdays at lunch anyway. They have parking \"in the back\" which is an extra 7-8 more spaces.  BUT if you can get in, the food is amazing. I've been twice and ordered enchiladas. You get 2 and can pick different kinds - I got the short rib and the chicken. SO GOOD!!  There are a bunch of toppings - kind of like a Chipotle assembly line - they put your food in the oven behind them (doesn't take long) and turns out SO delicious.  Green sauce is my favorite (spicier then red) but you can choose Christmas style if you want to try both the red and green.  The employees aren't that friendly and not very helpful if it's your first time - but the food is good enough to makeup for it. I also wish if you're buying a drink you can get a regular size cup but they are small.  I will be back regardless and would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me? (Insert an array of scrumptious like eating noises). Build your own mini enchiladas with fresh and tasty ingredients.   Several times I'll go for a family platter and just say, \"surprise me\" and see what they come up with. It's always tasty and their always very generous with all the free toppings and dressings.   We come here a few times a month. Never dissapointed. I recommend getting whatever meat choice you like and adding a bit of the spinach mushroom to it. The cornbread stuffing is a nice dessert."}
{"text":"I love this place!! Great service great food! I always get my enchiladas with a fried eggs on top its amazing!!!"}
{"text":"The chipotle of enchiladas... This idea could've gone one of two ways and it definitely went the successful way! Has a definite lunch rush so try and get there early! This place is a must try!"}
{"text":"This place is very interesting and what I appreciate is that it is not a franchise. I would compare this to a Chipotle restaurant but it is different. They tend to specialize in enchiladas, tacos, and unique salads.   Like Chipotle, you select your meat, your sauces, and toppings and then they bake your tray in the oven. I think it's even better than Chipotle but the food tends to be a little spicy so just be prepared for that. I chose the mild sauce and it was still spicy for me but I ate it all, no complaints. This is a definite must try restaurant. See pictures that others have loaded to get an idea what the food is like. Prices are very reasonable too, ranging around $7."}
{"text":"Chipotle meets gourmet enchiladas. That's what is going on... and I like it."}
{"text":"Everything is already hot, but still put into an oven for a minute or so just to melt the cheese. Since my soup was in a stoneware bowl it took a week to cool down. Afterward it tasted pretty damn good. However the tortilla soup is full of jalapeños. This is not listed anywhere I saw. It is so hot it was difficult for me to differentiate the tastes. A little hot pepper goes a long way. The amount used here is ridiculous. But I will be back to try again."}
{"text":"Absolutely one of a kind food, couldn't say enough good stuff about this place. Lots of great choices, and that cornbread is to die for."}
{"text":"Delicious! Yum, yum, yum: Best enchiladas/tacos ever! Good quality ingredients make the difference. Their tortilla's are homemade and toppings were da' bomb! Best part is that my taco was totally vegan.  Props to Gadzooks for offering cruelty free options in a place specializing in something that is traditionally made with tons of cheese. This was so good! I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I live down the street in Midtown Phoenix and just recently discovered Gadzooks. I have fallen in LOVE. The portions, quality, and flavors are just perfect. The staff is amazing and the selection of ingredients is bar none. I have taken all of my friends and family who come to visit to this restaurant and they too love the place."}
{"text":"Super fresh food but the line is too long for a quick-service restaurant and ordering my food was kinda a hassle because the menu is like over your head; it's hard to see.  It's like they tried to copy Chipotle but offer better quality food."}
{"text":"Cool concept, clean interior, and great customer service. I ordered 2 enchiladas with beef, pork, Christmas style.  The sauces' flavor was way to overpowering for me. I didn't really enjoy it and I usually like everything!  If I come back, maybe I'll try the tacos."}
{"text":"I have to say I was quite pleased with my first visit to Gadzooks. Had the tortilla soup with chicken as well as a bag of chips and salsa. The soup was quite hardy and the chips were excellent. I'll definitely be returning soon.  The only thing that looks like a challenge might be the parking on a busy Friday night, but I went at 9:30 when they seem to be winding things down."}
{"text":"I brought my husband here to try this local joint and we love it! We ordered way too much of course and now we split a 3 enchilada meal.  The green chili and the corn enchiladas are my favorite. It's a must try if you are in the area!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for tacos. The food is always hot and fresh. Staff is extremely friendly and helpful to anyone that has never been there before. My favorite thing to get is chicken tacos with goat cheese and a side of jalapeño cornbread. The chips and green salsa are the best also! Reasonably priced and you get out of there fairly quickly even if there's a long line."}
{"text":"Great! Quick service and amazing foods! One thing I love is the girl asked if I was vegetarian to make sure I didn't accidentally get something with meat."}
{"text":"Yes! Loved the fact that they have the \"Chipotle type\" set up where you can tell them what you want in your entree. I ordered the salad and was super impressed that they chopped and tossed it for me. Kinda like Coldstone. It was a sight to see. And to top it all off they have alcohol. It's close to work, so guess where I'll be headed again."}
{"text":"Outstanding food. Extremely friendly and helpful staff. Very clean and modern looking. I highly recommend you try this new establishment out."}
{"text":"Never been impressed with the food, been here a few times, will never go back. And there's a girl behind the counter that talks LOUDER than anyone I have ever encountered. Now whenever we hear a loud person we say 'The Gadzooks girl must be here\". Someone needs to tell her to stop screaming \"PICO DE GALLO?!?!!\" before she scares off more customers."}
{"text":"Enchilada meets Chipotle. It's a great idea but the corn tortillas were too thick, and the fillings and toppings were skimpy. The person only gave us a small scoop of sauce, salsa and toppings, and a sprinkle of cheese. Our orders didn't look like any of the yelp pictures and they tasted dry. It was our first time so, next time, we'll ask for more sauce and toppings."}
{"text":"Decent. I'm sure the meat options are better but their vegetarian options are kinda strange. I liked the cornbread and the guacamole,  tortillas were made well, but the combo of these flavors are just a little weird. The spinach and mushroom isn't my favorite. Cool spot just didn't satisfy my craving for Mexican food."}
{"text":"Eat here!  Bring your family and friends here!  My husband would make fun of the concept of an enchilada place as we drove by, but one I night I said we were eating there anyway and he loved the food as much as I did!  I've had both the chicken and the beef and both were delicious.  Green sauce recommended!  I've heard from others I have taken that the spinach and mushroom filling is even better than the beef.  Only issue is the line can get a bit backed up with all the options they have and people going in their first time.  It would be great if they could also put some guidance as to the options on the glass between the customers and the enchiladistas so you didn't have to keep stepping back and looking up.  I plan on going back at least weekly...and I don't think my husband will mind either :)"}
{"text":"I used to love coming here but it just seems like it's going down hill. The prices have gone up and they now charge for guac (LAME). The quality of the food just isn't as good as it used to be. I stopped by on NYE and noticed my chicken enchilada just didn't taste right. Fast forward a few hours and I was praying to the porcelain gods. Pretty damn sure I got food poisoning. I used to rave about this place but now I tell friends to steer clear."}
{"text":"Okay so I worked customer service so I really weigh in on that more. The food was delicious however it's a new place. And I'm a new customer. The staff was not very friendly. They didn't speak loud at all. The first girl that helped me with the poofy hair just pointed to the stuff like I'm supposed to know what everything is already  so. Super annoying. There was a wait while the stuff cooked in the oven. Maybe should start a number system. It's not quick like chipotle so having your guests stand 6+ min in line is not fun. It would have been better if I went all the way through placed my order paid and then they said it was ready. No plastic forks were available I had to ask. And the energy was okay. The workers need to smile more. It's enchiladas and soup. I'd expect the warm cozy feeling to experience. Otherwise the food  was bomb! The cornbread is really good just a little to spicy for me."}
{"text":"My sister and I had been looking forward for this place to open since we live down the street and thought it'd be a good place to grab a bite regularly.  We were there a few days ago and we were both extremely disappointed! We waited 20-30 min to get our food. The staff was nice but moved very slow. The fresh tortilla concept is great but they were too thick and undercooked. The meat needed more flavor but the green chili was pretty good. They offer no sides and as a Mexican I'd like some beans or rice with my enchiladas. The food wasn't very filling for the price we paid.   Im willing to give this place a second chance being that it is new.  Hopefully they make necessary changes."}
{"text":"Though I am neither a vegetarian nor gluten-intolerant, I do have family and friends that are. While neither of those specific family or friends were with me on this particular evening, the person in line infornt of me was gluten-intolerant and the person in line behind me was a vegetarian. I was very impressed how when they each explained their dietary restrictions to the person helping them that each staff member knew exactly what that customer could and could not have and explained their menu items and what was in each, down to which items were made with chicken stock (which I've noticed some people don't seem to realize that just because there are no chunks of meat in something, that if made with an animal stock is NOT vegetarian). It's nice to see a business properly and thoroughly train their employees about their food beyond the information needed to be provided the majority of its customer base. Gadzooks realizes that the majority is not the entire customer base and has accomodated those with other dietary needs with a place to go and eat at with the assurance that they are infact able to enjoy their food without fear that the person helping them gave them false information."}
{"text":"Place was amazing! Had The short rib enchiladas - corn side was delicious Definitely coming back for more!! Can't wait"}
{"text":"Get beyond the name and they may have something here. It's a great play off of the build to order service ie Chipotle etc, but instead of burritos it's enchiladas. I love the idea, but was a little disappointed by the descriptions of ingredients, ambiance and service. I think there should be a little more info on the sauces/salsa's. Might be a little helpful for those going for the first time. The place itself is a little stark or cold feeling. Maybe somewhat picky, but me and gf both thought the place felt weird. The service was sub par. The soup that was ordered was forgotten about and instead of reheating it because it sat on the counter they just served it to us cold.   The upside is that this place is a great idea and good food here. The flour/corn tortillas are delicious and meat is tender and seasoned well. We will give another shot and update the review."}
{"text":"Chicken enchiladas are my favorite, so when I heard about this place where you create your own enchiladas, I had to try it. I got the 2 enchiladas with corn tortillas, both chicken, 1 w/ red sauce, 1 w/ green, asadero cheese, and a side of sour cream. I thought they said the red sauce was mild, but to me it tasted spicier than the green sauce. I preferred the green sauce over the red. The chicken was good, but overall the enchiladas didn't hit the spot for me... and it was rather pricey for lunch... and no rice & beans... Their drink cups are small so I ended up getting about 3 refills. We decided to try their brown sugar glazed pumpkin cookies on a whim. They were alright. I can probably cross Gadzooks off my list."}
{"text":"It took me a while to get in, because the name was somewhat deceiving. What is GadZooks? And what does it have to do with Enchiladas? I still don't know, but after a few recommendations I have it a try. I have since been back a few times.   Despite its odd name, GadZooks is like a chipotle for Enchiladas. You basically pick out your filling (from about 8 choices), sauce, and then condiments (ie cheese, lettuce, Guac). Staff then cook it in the oven and send you on your way. I'm also a fan of the pumpkin cookies they have been serving during the fall.   I haven't yet tried any of the soups, but the enchiladas were tasty. Another note- this isn't exactly authentic Mexican food, and chiles are very mild (to set proper expectations)."}
{"text":"A good life axiom is \"a copy is never as good as the original.\" This typically holds true with food as well. Especially when a friend says, \"this place is just like (insert national, trendy burrito brand here).\" So when I walked into Gadzooks my expectations lowered when I saw their signage and exposed brushed aluminum decorum copied a particular well know brand. But it's here the comparisons have to end, because these guys are attempting to master the enchilada market.   And wow, do they handle this so well!  Providing a full array of corn, flour, and wheat variant tortillas along with fresh meats and vegetables. Along with a decent vegan selection as well. The customer walks the serving area as the server explains all their featured meats (today's was locally sourced bison). You can mix and match your meats, cheeses and sauces at no extra cost. They do \"charge extra for the guac\" , but I'm used to this by now. After you've built your masterpiece, your server plates it and puts into a large wood fired oven for a thorough melting of meats and cheese. You can also order an egg to top it off, which I happily did.   Very impressed in this wonderful Phoenix original. I travel multiple times a month Phoenix and I'm positive I'll be making this a regular on dining out."}
{"text":"I can't eat at this place enough.  Best enchiladas I've ever had.  All of the different options are really good, but the sweet and spicy cornbread is off the charts."}
{"text":"The little lady and I have been to Gadzooks numerous times, and we love it. It is one of central Phoenix's gems, and if nothing else, it is the best Mexican food at this particular intersection (those of you familiar with the intersection will know what I'm referring to). It's funny, every time we go it takes us a few minutes to figure out what we want. The staff is always quick to offer to explain how things work and discuss any recent changes on the menu. I want to tell then we have been before, but they are so friendly, we just let them explain it.   The concept is pretty simple, it is Chipotle style enchiladas. They also have soup, but we haven't had it so I can't vouch.  The enchiladas are excellent. The yukon gold sounds odd (a potato enchilada?), but I crave them like a fat kid craves cake. I am also partial to the short rib, and pork. Others are good too, but I can (or at least should) only eat three per sitting so this is my typical order. We prefer the green sauce, but we usually do. The slaw is awesome too, gives the food a little crunch. Everything just depends on our mood, customize and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Also:  it is a little intimidating/overwhelming on your first visit.  I stared at the menu board for about 2 minutes and was still undecided and somewhat confused,and  thats when the gal behind the counter asked if i had ever been there before and proceeded to very patiently and thoroughly explain the process and the options...that was very helpful.  Granted, there was no one behind me in line (i got there right as they opened).  By the time i left, the place was packed and there was a long line, so others may not have had the opportunity for full explanation as did i.  Just something to keep in mind on your first visit; its kind of like a crash course in a new language.. but worth the effort!"}
{"text":"I had heard great things about this place and was so excited to try it.  Soooooo glad that I did.  :)  The decor of the place is simple but there is a nice patio seating area so that you can enjoy the weather.  I think I was a Pavlovian dog, while waiting in line to place my order.  I chose two enchiladas one with pork green chili and the other a potato and cornbread mixture.  Smothered in a green chili sauce and baked to perfection. Definitely add the fried egg on top, it makes everything taste yummy."}
{"text":"I am updating my review to a 5 stars because I've been here now more than a few times, and it NEVER disappoints. The flavors are so amazing, everything tastes so fresh, homemade, I love it! The only thing I dislike it's their ridiculous long and slow line during lunch, last time I stood there for 35 mins...there goes my 1 hr lunch! Their crema, salsas, tortillas, meats are SO good!  This place is really really really good!  I've been there a couple of times, and the quality of the food never disappoints. I've gotten the 2 enchiladas, with green sauce, short rib, and all the toppings. Their food is tasty, it has great natural flavors, and the combination it's like a party in your mouth. The only thing I dislike about this place is that it's too small, and there's always a long line. However, when it comes to their food, the flavors are great, portions are decent, and definitely leaves you wanting to go back."}
{"text":"The food is good but the portions are small and is very expensive and overpriced for the food they serve. If you ask for your eggs easy or medium it always comes out fried well done. This food is easy to make at home yourself. No need to pay the high prices for such naturally inexpensive food"}
{"text":"We have eaten in this little restaurant many times over the past couple of years. The food is really good 90% of the time. Don't be expecting any fresh filtered water from the drink dispenser...it's AWFUL water. The enchiladas and tacos are wonderful, especially when you get a server who actually puts a decent amount of meat in them. I say that because some of the kids put a generous heap of meat in the tacos/enchiladas, and then pull some of it back out...while you are watching. At $8.25 per taco, I don't expect stingy. Tried their cornbread, but we didn't care for their \"version\" of cornbread...dry and loaded with green chiles. Our review speaks less about the food, and more about the \"feel\" of this place. In the summer, it is oppressively hot inside, and in the winter they run A/C and it is very cold. Isn't that backwards? This place draws an eclectic crowd, and has a noise level that is LOUD, due to the constant scraping of metal chairs on concrete floors and significant number of noisy rude customers packed into a small eating area. Also, most customers don't seem to realize that you are expected to clear your own table, and not just get up and leave your mess for someone else to deal with. Because of the location of this restaurant, don't be surprised if you are treated to some entertaining Police arrests taking place in the parking lot too. If you are looking for a peaceful eating experience, this really isn't the best pick!"}
{"text":"Absolutely addicting - so many options! I think I ate there at least 4 times the week before I moved because I knew I would miss it so much!!!!"}
{"text":"It's pretty damn good. However, it needs a bit more spice and flavor, but then again it might just be me and my liking for spicy food."}
{"text":"Just the best. Gadzooks, what is there to say. The enchiladas - superb. The soup - sublime. The ability to custom tailor everything the way you desire - brilliant.  But the best part? The cornbread. Oh, that is heavenly. I could eat that cornbread all day and I'd be fatter than a pig before slaughter and happier than a puppy in a ball pen."}
{"text":"This place has really lost its flair to me. I feel like my experience gets worse with every visit. The flavors of the sauces are more vinegary, portions are much smaller and the service is really slow. It just feels like the staff is in this weird daze and they don't know how to multitask or something.   I know in my previous review I stated that it was worth the wait but everything added up now makes it no longer worth it.  Oh and don't get hot food to go - does not travel well."}
{"text":"Best place for me right now.  I'm exhausted,  little sleep,  but knew I needed to eat before heading to an AirBnB after a shitty hotel. So that's my mood and I came here,  overwhelmed by choices.  They were so friendly and walked me through the process to order two enchiladas.  I ended up with the flour mixture tortilla,  with cornbread and chicken in one,  and short ribs and something else yummy in the other.  A side of the slaw set it off perfectly with a bit of sour crunch.  What could make this any better?  White sangria. They let you sample the food,  the sangria and margaritas.  Owned by a young guy in his 20s. His mom fresh bakes the cookies everyday.  Mmmmmm.  Pumpkin.  I can't believe I almost got a sandwich from Walgreens.  Glad I work in the area,  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Love this place!  PROS: Modern Mexican food Counter service Green chile pork - tasty and not overly salty Sweet and spicy cornbread - interesting way to have it in your enchilada, original! Love all the salsas and toppings...pickled onions, crema, different levels of heat for the salsa  Pay attention and reiterate your order when they take your meal out of the oven, there was a mix up with mine and accidentally added toppings to another person's order..."}
{"text":"The enchiladas are unparalleled.  Quick and easy service with lots of options.  An upscale Chipotle."}
{"text":"How does this place not have 5 stars? The food is so omg good! The staff is always friendly and they always remind me that the red sauce isn't vegetarian, which is super helpful! The cornbread and the mashed potato enchiladas and so good! Definitely a great place for vegetarians!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to place when I'm really hungry. The food is always reliably tasty and filling!"}
{"text":"One of the best fast casual concepts around. And it's right here in Phoenix at Seventh Street & Osborn! The line to order can be long, but it moves quickly. The friendly counter staff will walk you through your options as needed. You choose it, fill it and cover it. It's a process any Chipotle regular will feel comfortable with - plus, they have tortilla soup!   Two recommendations for first time visitors: 1) go \"Christmas style\" with both green and red chile, and 2) go half and half filling your enchiladas. That way you can maximize what you sample so you'll know what to order next time. And there will be a next time!  There is a small dog friendly outdoor patio in addition to indoor seating. The patio is very pleasant right after sunset even though it's on a busy street."}
{"text":"I had the chicken, tri tip, pork, and, cornbread enchiladas!  And I still have the flavor in my mouth can't wait to take my mom here you guys know What your doing will definitely be back :P"}
{"text":"Great place and the food was so fresh. The drink cups were very small. I know it's free refills but would have liked a bigger cup. The food prep was fast for a lunch and I received my order quickly. The chips should have been a bigger size. Maybe 1/2 a bag instead of 1/4 a bag. I will definitely go back and I rated a 4 instead of a five because of not enough chips. My dish was spicy and I love spicy. Great place for lunch."}
{"text":"My family enjoyed a really yummy dinner here!  The tortillas are delicious, the rib meat stuffing was great and my dad's favorite.  My daughter loved the pork.  I had the rib meat, yum, and loved the mild red sauce.  I'm quite a wimp and appreciated that this had flavor without frying my tongue.  A little fresh crema and cheese mellowed it out perfectly.    In an odd twist, they had pumpkin spice cookies with brown sugar frosting on the counter.  At first I thought, what an odd choice after enchiladas.  Turns out they were insanely good and very good after enchiladas!  Apparently I am old and I say things like \"it's too noisy in here\"... because it was a bit.  The only menu is up way high so I just got a general idea of what I wanted and asked a lot of questions.  The staff was great and didn't seem to mind.    Everyone in the family really did enjoy the meal - we were the clean plate club.  Next visit, I am getting my own spinach and mushroom enchiladas.  And, I must confess, another cookie :-)"}
{"text":"Really flavorful.  Fun experience to really personalize my food, which is nice because i'm picky.  The staff was eager to let me sample.  I didn't think i would ever be interested in having a cornbread filling, but i'll have to do that next because it was amazing!  I ordered two enchiladas: one pork and one chicken, with the red sauce.  I think next time i'll have get the fried egg, because the sauce and pork were so dark a flavor that it needed it to smooth it out for my tastes.  (I fried my own egg to go with my left overs, yum)   I think for a local small start-up business to expect them to have the multitude of ingredient available all the time, is a lot to expect.    They had everything there for us to try!  The menu was a little confusing only in that i didn't know why they listed salad dressings like they might apply to an enchilada, and it would have been nice if there were little signs labeling what all the ingredients were on the glass.  It also would have been helpful to have paper menus to grab and step aside to read over.  I felt uncomfortable standing next to a table of customers eating to read the menu so that others could go ahead of me.  I don't have the best hearing, but did okay talking through the glass and wide counter."}
{"text":"The other day I was mentioning to my sister that I like enchiladas, but they're usually so badly done that I never order them. I then saw her eyes light up and she yelled, \"Gadzooks!\" As I began to slowly back away she told me about this terrific spot she likes to go for lunch and how I *had* to go there. Initially I was hesitant -especially after she mentioned the Chipotle-style ordering method- but after a long day at the ballpark I really just wanted something quick, good and cheap. So, I begrudgingly went in a bit skeptical, but I came out a huge fan.  Enchiladas:  Tortillas- Gadzooks offers two tortillas: corn or their \"half n' half\" mix (a combo of corn and flour)--both are made in house right in front of your eyes. I got the half n' half on mine and it was terrific; good corn flavor with the softness you crave from flour tortillas. 5*  Filling- I got three different fillings: Green Chile Pork, Guajillo Short Rib, and Chile Cornbread mix. Oddly enough, I thought the Cornbread mix was phenomenal; it was sweet and spicy and gave a nice contrast to the richness of everything else in the dish. The Short Rib was my number two pick, but the cornbread kicked ass. 5*  Toppings- This is the cheese and salsa portion of the enchilada. They have your typical red and green salsa or you can \"Christmas\" it and get 1/2 of each--of course I Christmas'd it! Surprisingly, I'd have to say I preferred their green sauce, but if I came back I'd probably just Christmas it again. I also got a combo of their two cheeses: Asadero and Chihuahua and it was all good. 4.5*  Add-ons: Gadzooks has some cool stuff you can throw on top after your enchilda is done cooking; they have Guacamole, over-easy Egg and Goat Cheese. I opted for the Guacamole -I'm from Cali--you know how we do it!- but I'm really curious about the egg. 5*  Toppings part 2 (The Revenge!)- A second helping of Salsa and Cheese?! ¡Sí, por favor! I kept it simple with the Pico de Gallo and some crumbled Cotija Cheese. 4*  Service & Ambiance- The staff on the night I went were all terrific and very helpful. They'll let you sample away at anything you want so that you'll get your order perfect--so, don't be shy! The first thing you'll notice as you enter Gadzooks is how clean and modern the place is--actually the first thing you'll notice is how delicious everything smells, but I was talking sight-wise. There's indoor and outdoor seating and it feels very spacious, even though it kinda isn't. 5*   Value- Terrific value as you can get a 2 Enchilada plate for $6 or $8 for those of us that are feeling like little piggies. The kids' meals are also value-priced at only $3.75! 5*  I think Gadzooks has earned a nice place in my heart and would definitely be in my weekly lunch rotation if I worked in the area. Awesome service, great food and value pricing are hard to come by these days and the fact that it's a small locally-owned business just further endears it to me. Highly, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This place is so good! It reminds me of Chipotle, only I like this food. I always feel like a foreigner when I go somewhere new but these people are cool and take the time to explain the ordering process. Let me suggest the mashed potato enchilada...so good!! And good prices"}
{"text":"This place has the best damn nachos! I live really close by, so I usually come here once or twice a week for their nachos and they never disappoint. Their tortilla soup is very tasty as well. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Gadzooks is awesome! I come here frequently because I work down the street, and when friends/colleagues come here from out of town, I always recommend this place as one of the top 3 places they need to try. They always thank me later.  I've never had the tacos, so I can't comment on those, but I always get the enchiladas and they're always amazing. The chicken and Green chile pork are my favorite with a Christmas sauce (half red half green). They also serve Bison each day until they run out. I tried it once and it was pretty good... Nothing super special as far as taste goes... But it's nice to say you've tried it.  Get a side of sweet and spicy cornbread! So good! The guacamole is really good too. I highly suggest getting there by 11:30AM at the latest if you're going for lunch. It gets packed really fast."}
{"text":"AWESOME. That may even be an understatement. This place creates enchiladas that are a flavor explosion in your mouth. There are so many different flavors and combinations, but no matter which way you build your enchilada, it's going to be a success.   I hate to do this because I'm sure they hear it all the time, but it's very similar to Chipotle in the way you order and build your food. You walk up and go through a process which is nicely explained on their menu above the ordering area. The people behind the counter are very friendly and will help you along the way if you get lost on your first time through.   I'll share my combination because it was incredible and gives an idea of how the whole thing works. I got two enchiladas in flour tortillas (they have both corn and flour tortillas made in house!). In one enchilada I got the green chile pork and in the other I got the sweet and spicy cornbread. Next I chose the green sauce and asadero cheese (aka jack cheese). Then they throw it into an open oven and let the cheese melt and bubble over the top. Next I topped mine with Uncle Rico's Pico, crumbled cojita cheese (more cheese!), honey v slaw (SO GOOD), pickled onion, and scratch made crema. Lastly I got the jalapeno ranch on the side, which I'm glad I did because it had a nice kick to it!  I went with 4 people and our total came out to about $32! WHAT A STEAL. We just got waters and skipped on the chips and guac but I still left the restaurant feeling full and happily satisfied.   I hope they open up more location closer to home because I'd eat here all the time."}
{"text":"Best enchiladas in Phoenix hands down. Definitely addicted! Braised bison and spinach and mushroom are my favorite."}
{"text":"Doesn't look like much when you step inside, kinda chipotleish setup, where you setup your meal your way, but the flavor is great.  We had the green chili pork and the shredded short ribs and the flavors were just great had ours topped Xmas style."}
{"text":"I have tried the tacos, enchiladas, nachos, soup, and salads depending on my mood.  All the ingredients are fresh so you can't go wrong.  This place is a must try--if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"Always a quick and great meal.  Avoid the lunch rush!"}
{"text":"The food was great.  The service not so much.  You're ordering your food through a glass partition in a noisy restaurant with little to no guidance from those who work there.  I don't particularly like my enchiladas with a side of stank eye, but that's just me."}
{"text":"Personal favorite here is the Nachos, they do 2 layers of meat, cheese and chips, so the last bite is just as good as the first. Get the Bison meat if you have the chance, sometimes it runs out early but definitely worth it! Great concept, great food, they'll be a household name soon enough!"}
{"text":"Some very interesting takes on a Mexican style restaurant! It's a cafeteria service in which you proceed down a service line and select an Enchilada, Taco, or Soup and then your choices of meat, tortilla, sauce, salsa, and extras. They then baked it to a crispy, toasty, finish. Similar to Chipolte and Rio Bravo.  I  ordered two beef short rib Enchiladas, with half corn/flour tortillas, red sauce, and Guacamole and extra Cheese accompaniements. Also a side dish of green chiles, cornbread, cheese and spices that was very tasty."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try it for quite some time, today was the day!  Wow! I am so glad l did, it was a treat.  I had a simple corn chowder topped with Pico de Gallo, sour cream and corn bread along with one spinach mushroom enchilada topped with Chile Verde and lava habanero sauce.  It was delish, the chowder was flavorful with a definite cilantro undertone. Spinach and mushrooms were freshly cooked, well seasoned.  It is a must a must try at least once and then make it monthly habit!"}
{"text":"In town for the weekend and found this place online listed as one of the best Mexican restaurants in Phoenix. Have to agree. Excellent quality and would totally return if i was a local."}
{"text":"Good quality food. I love their enchiladas and tacos. Not a big fan of their salads. Good service and good good!"}
{"text":"First timer here but I will be back. Place was packed with a line out the door during Friday's lunch rush but had my food within 10 minutes. I ordered the two enchiladas, one green chili pork and one tomatillo chicken. They were both excellent but I give a slight edge to the pork. Very unique restaurant with a lot of local flair. Highly recommend to anyone in the area visiting Phoenix and who wants some local flavor. Phoenix can be proud of Gadzooks!"}
{"text":"...... Sorry, let me pick my drooling jaw up off the floor.   This place is AMAZING. I usually get two enchiladas with 50/50 tortilla (YUM) and short rib for filling. The short rib is so smoky and delicious. I LOVE that they fire it up in open flame. I can't get enough of the slaw and pickled red onions either. Such a perfect balance to the savory/smoky meat. I will occasionally switch it up with a taco which is equally delicious.   Do yourself a favor and grab some enchiladas from Gadzooks for dinner tonight!"}
{"text":"I just went here tonight and I do not know why I haven't been here before! The place was really inventive with the fillings for the enchiladas. They had corn bread and mashed potatoes and short rib and all kinds of deliciousness. I got enchiladas like I've never had before. Short rib and mashed potato with christmas style sauce (red and greed), a fried egg, slaw, pico, cheese, ohhh my, it was delicious. Also got the guac, which was wonderful! I got two enchiladas and still have plenty left for lunch tomorrow. I will definitely be back!! (I had a taste of the cornbread...and I need more!)"}
{"text":"We chose this place based on other yelp reviews! We were not disappointed! Our food was awesome, particularly the chicken and the pork! Our service was awesome, the people behind the counter were very knowledgeable on explaining what the ingredients were and how it worked to build your own enchiladas! I will definetely be back!"}
{"text":"this place is packed during the lunch rush-- if you can hold out-- go on an off hour.   I am a huge fan of this place, they have wonderful options for many dietary needs, and their tortilla soup--OMG!"}
{"text":"Really cool concept with quick, cheap and delicious food. Kinda like a fancy \"chipotle\" but for enchiladas, you get to make your own set of enchiladas or tacos in an assembly line fashion with a host of really tasty ingredients.  I'm vegetarian, so I was very pleased to see 3 yummy veggie options on the menu, and my enchilada-maker made sure to inform me which ingredients were veg and which weren't.  I got 3 enchiladas (with their special mixed tortillas made from both flour & corn) filled with spinach & mushroom, potato, and spicy cornbread respectively. Then topped with verde sauce and jack and cheddar cheese before being quickly baked to sizzling perfection. I added pico de gallo, habañero lava salsa, pickled onions, guacamole and cotija cheese on top.  Delicious!  An awesome twist on traditional enchiladas and I loved seeing them made quickly before my eyes.  Would recommend to anyone in Phoenix looking for a tasty bite. My Lyft driver on the way over was raving about it as well, so they're clearly doing everything right!"}
{"text":"Tasty fresh Mexican food. They specialize in enchiladas and tacos. Very good. They make fresh tortillas corn and flour."}
{"text":"This place was close to our hotel so we decided to check it out after reading great reviews. The ordering process was a little confusing, but I managed to order some delicious tacos. My bf originally ordered enchiladas but somehow ended up with tacos. Other than that, great food and good service. Need a place like this in Chicago (hint, hint) :)"}
{"text":"AMAZING!! I cannot write enough about how delicious this place is! Went there for lunch and line was out the door! SO worth the wait! Everything is so fresh and flavorful! It makes Chipotle look like the ugly step child!"}
{"text":"Wow, I can't believe how good this place is! Most of their stuff is made in house and incredibly fresh. You can tell there's a lot of pride in the quality of food here. They are incredibly generous with portions. Check out the corn bread droooool"}
{"text":"Interesting concept -- as another reviewer pointed out, it's Chipotle for Enchiladas.  Decent food and may be an interesting \"been there, done that\" check off your list.    Best of luck for this new restaurant -- approx 3 months old."}
{"text":"My mouth is watering just thinking about my last meal at Gadzooks! So much flavor and great spice! I love being able to create my own enchiladas and having vegetarian options!"}
{"text":"I freakin love this place. I'd give it 5 stars but for some reason the restaurant is tiny. And in a summer afternoon it is uncomfortably hot. Hopefully the Scottsdale location has better AC, more space, or has North/South exposure."}
{"text":"Excellent enchiladas!  I had the short rib with as much stuff I can put on as possible.  I waited in line for awhile on my lunch break to get the whole enchilada, but it was definitely worth it.  I can't stop thinking about this place haha"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food made in style with a homemade touch!"}
{"text":"Absolutely killer!! Try mixing the short rib with the cornbread for a sweet and smokey flavor in your enchiladas. First time in, but definitely not my last. Good value for the quality."}
{"text":"This place is unbelievable! We went here with some friends for a pre-party dinner on New Year's Eve. I think there is something magical that happens when they add the cheese and put the dish in the oven because it comes out tasting like heaven. Everyone in the group ordered different items, and all were completely impressed with the taste, speed of preparation, and price. We were probably about 2 bites in before the first person started to plan out how to get here for a weekday lunch from a job in North Phoenix. As someone who often chooses vegetarian options as restaurants, I was amazed at the number of choices for non-carnivores. I had an enchilada with chicken (needed the protein) and one with spinach and mushrooms. Both were great but the mushroom was perfect. Next time I'm trying the cornbread stuffing mix. I wish this chain would build locations in every part of town. In the mean time, I'll be looking for reasons to be in the neighborhood just so I can curb my enchiladas cravings!"}
{"text":"I used to work at Gadzooks in high school. First hand, I can tell you that the quality and care for the ingredients that make your food is one of the best you'll see in the valley at local establishments. I'm not sure how things are done now, however I imagine the process has stayed relatively the same. All salsas and enchilada sauces, including the crema, are made in house. The masa (dough) for the corn tortillas came from a local business. The 50/50 tortilla masa is made in house. They're then pressed and slapped on the grill to warm perfection, ready to be rolled or filled.   When it comes to ordering, the process is relatively simple and quick. You choose a base for your entree (soup, salad, tacos, or enchiladas). If you get the tacos or enchiladas, you pick the tortilla you'd like them made in. Your choices are all corn or half corn/half flour tortillas (\"50/50\"). For a gluten free option they offer roasted poblano peppers. The rest follows with picking a filling which includes a variety of proteins and/or vegetarian options. For enchiladas, you then pick the enchilada sauce. Choices are a tangy green sauce or smokey red. In my opinion neither are spicy, however the red might be the milder option. Two cheeses are also available if you'd like. The soup and enchiladas get placed into the high temp oven until the cheese gets what we called \"cheetah spots\" and is melted into cheesy goodness. Tacos can also be placed into the oven if you'd like them toasted.  Once your entree out of the oven, you move to the toppings area of the line where a beautiful array of salsas and house specialty dressings await your choosing. Salads also get topped, except your process eliminates the oven. Gadzooks is on the heavier side of a food fill, but its oh so yummy!"}
{"text":"Decided to stop here after being severely disappointed by Americas taco shop down the street .. Let me just say this place took the cake simply amazing to say the least. Everything tasted fresh and was bursting with flavor yet they has the speed of a chipotle .. We have been left in utter disbelief this is our new goto enchilada joint .. Step aside nana you have competition..."}
{"text":"Ambience: B Cleanliness: A+ Customer Service: A Food: ----  Price  -It was fast food price but this is certainly a step up from fast food so I would say its a pretty good deal.   Atmosphere -For the lack of more refined language, I would say this place is like the like the love child of Panera Bread and Chipotle but Panera also had a thing with Tex-Mex truck next door, so there are some questions about the true paternity. It is not a bad atmosphere it is just different but it works for the type of food that's being served.    Customer Service  The service is a lot like Chipotle; they make everything costume and ask you what you want on your food in a line order sort of fashion. Its pretty quick and efficient and everyone seemed friendly enough.    Food  I didn't really like what I ordered, it had a lot of flavor to it but I didn't particularly care for the flavor. I don't want to take a star away because I didn't like what I ordered because I was with 10 other people and they all loved their food. I did finish off one of my friend's tacos and I quite enjoyed them so I just didn't pick a good meal for myself. Their chips and salsa are REALLY good though.   Overall It's a quick, almost fast food type place, but its nice."}
{"text":"My brother takes me here every time I visit!  The food is delicious.  The menu is small, but that's how you know the speciality is going to be delicious.  The speciality in this case is enchiladas.  They have bison, but it sells out really early and I've never tried it.  Otherwise, I'm a fan of the pork and my brother likes the short ribs.    If you're stumped about what to try, just ask anyone working there and they're happy to help you out -- everyone is super friendly and knowledgable about the food and what goes well together.  I like stacking the red sauce, the cole slaw, and jalapeño ranch sauce -- the end result is spicy but not overly intense.   I think the homemade chips are a little salty, but they are thick and make for a good base to scoop up extra enchilada innards!  Yum!  Apparently the lines right at lunch hour are pretty long because it is located near the business/professional district so if you have a flexible schedule, it might be best to go during a slightly off time.  But don't let the potential for a wait scare you away!  They move fast, and the food is worth waiting a few minutes."}
{"text":"You can get tacos and enchiladas customized how you like it - sort of similar to Chipotle in that you're ordering at a cafeteria-type line.  I ordered two tacos and selected short ribs for one and mushroom/spinach for the other.  I also saw they have a mashed potatoes filling that looked pretty yummy, I might have to get that next time!  You can also pick from a variety of salsas, and something different from Chipotle is that they also offer a cabbage slaw and picked onions on top.  I tried the slaw, just bc I like eating as many veggies as possible, and it was a nice addition!  I would love to come here again, although come at around 11:30 for lunch bc after that the parking lot and the line become a big pain!"}
{"text":"How have I not reviewed Gadzooks yet?!  Some people have compared this place to Chipotle or Subway.  Ignore them.  Yes, the food may be \"fast,\" but this is not a fast food joint.  I've always associated fast food with bad food.  This food is not that.  I've had the soups and the enchiladas.  I really don't think you can go wrong with what you order here.  From what I've seen, the more things you ask for, the better it tastes.  I always say yes to all the sauteed veggies, goat buttermilk sauce (I think that's what the white stuff is? okay, maybe not, but it's something like that), and additional garnishes they recommend.  You end up with a juicy, delicious enchilada piled high with all the extras that really make Mexican food sing.  They'll ask you the same questions about your bowl of soup.  It all tastes good in the soup.  Just say yes to everything they recommend and thank me later."}
{"text":"I live right down the street, so I have been watching the renovation progress for some time now.  Needless to say, I've been looking forward to this place opening up.  I was born and raised in New Mexico, so homemade Mexican food was always a staple at our house.  Let me start with saying that the food was good.  The sauces were very flavorful, and I was mostly pleased with the end product.  The experience as a whole is what was disappointing for me.  The menu....it is not your regular run-of-the-mill order the item as it reads.  You build your own meal based on many different varieties.  While the staff wasn't rude, they were not very helpful with helping the guests through the process.  Bottom line, ordering was extremely awkward.  On top of that, they were out of a few things that I would consider staples to the experience, such as corn tortillas, pico de gallo, and one of the red salsas.    I expected the whole ordering to paying time to be somewhat comparable to that of a Chipotle or Subway experience, but it took much MUCH longer...even though the restaurant was relatively empty.  My boyfriend and I ordered to go, and at the very end of it all our meals in tin containers were simply wrapped in tissue paper and string.  The cheese and sauce was all stuck to the top by the time we got home, a mere mile away.  Not to mention you couldn't stack them on top of eachother because there wasn't a more rigid surface on top of the container.  My advice would be to sell the expensive string wrapping machine, and spend a little money on some plain old take out lids.  In the end, the taste of the food was jaded by our overall experience.  I am still undecided as to whether or not to go back.  Needless to say, after months of waiting for this place to come to fruition, I was definitely disappointed with it....total bummer."}
{"text":"I hardly ever take the time to write out a review, but this experience could not go ignored. I would  have much rather spent my hard earned money elsewhere.   The glass that separates you and the ordering counter must make it hard for them to hear, I had to repeat myself constantly. It would've been helpful to have been told that from the get go instead of figuring it out at the end.   I asked for a sample of the chicken because I've never been and was having a hard time ordering, the guy looked at me like I was stupid for asking. I pointed at little plastic containers they had by the meat and said that they must obviously give samples. He finally let me try a bit.  It was a big ordeal to find out how long of a wait it was for the green chile pork to come out. I had to ask him like 4  different times if he would just make one with the little bit that was left. He acted annoyed for having to scoop out the meat that was left because it required a bit more effort.   The lady at the checkout was rude when I asked if I could pay while I waited for it to finish cooking.  She ignored us until I asked for drink cups. All in all, the food was ok (the tortilla soup was a massive disappointment, they don't even put tortilla in it. Don't order it if you are a fan of tortilla soup, the flavor was off), the service sucks and the line is a cluster f***k. At least chipotle has an efficient and friendly assembly line. I will not be returning. Much better places to support in the area."}
{"text":"Glad I didn't pay!! I did look at the reviews before going and they were border line so I decided to try this myself...those that gave 5 stars must not have experianced true authentic enchiladas! The posted menu was super confusing, when I finally got the hang of it I ordered a green chicken enchilada and a short rib enchilada. I added my sauces, some toppings, sat down. Not very much space in the resturant. The decor is okay, although I'm the type of person who would sit on the floor and look at blank walls if the food was outstanding...this was not! CUMIN does not equal Mexican. Both the sauces I got on my enchilads were overly spiced with cumin aswell as the both meats so it was CUMIN overload...I was no impressed to say the least. I would not be going back to this place, not even if invited and it was free!"}
{"text":"I love Gadzooks! I'm very critical of new restaurants and this place is impressive. Clever idea to go to market with enchiladas and soups. What impressed me the most....wood burning oven, high quality meats, options, and quick order to pick up time. Open and clean design inside. I highly recommend this place for brunch, lunch of dinner."}
{"text":"Great food but the service is poor. The men are especially grumpy. I'm pretty sure customers irritate  them."}
{"text":"The food was good, but I probably won't go back.  This place is a bit of a Chipotle knockoff with enchiladas, tacos and soup.  However, they must have skipped over the assembly line lesson, because ordering food is chaotic at best! The menu is super confusing, so that explains the long lines, and it's noisy as hell, so be prepared to yell back and forth with whomever is making your food.  I was a bit annoyed with the process.  I like getting my food in peace!  So my advice - go there in a great mood, be prepared to get aggravated a bit while ordering your food, and in the end you'll have good food to enjoy and forget all about the craziness that just ensued! Oh....and their s'mores cookies were awesome!"}
{"text":"Interesting concept. Think Chipotle or Qdoba, but with enchiladas.  Smashed potatoes as a filling are great - seriously. Doesn't seem like it, but I love them. Short ribs are also yummy. Cornbread is also really, really good, and spicy, so if you have a sensitive stomach, skip it.  Both the red and green salsa are good. I recommend getting it Christmas style unless you have a strong preference for one flavor over the other. All the salsas are good, and I love the pickled onions as a touch of sweetness and freshness to balance the decadence of the short ribs. I like having the buttermilk and jalapeno ranch dressings on the side for a bit of extra flavor.  Prices are reasonable, and I'm always super full for a long time after a meal here. It gets busy during lunch, so stopping by a little early or late can cut down on wait time. Parking is right up front, and there's a patio if you so choose."}
{"text":"Just do it. I got the bison and beef enchiladas and it was the best decision all day. Great flavor impressive for such a local spot. Will return next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This place is legit! Found it one day using the \"wheel of lunch\" and gave it a shot. One of my favorite lunch spots in central Phoenix. I always do two enchiladas with the 50/50 tortilla. I do a different meat in each (the chicken is one of my favs though). The red enchilada sauce is a little more smokey, the green is a perfect spice. I usually do my enchiladas Christmas style to have the best of both worlds.   One piece of advice is they are a pretty small establishment. During the lunch rush (which starts about 11:30) I usually go the takeout route."}
{"text":"Passed by the restaurant many times. Did not stop in because the name of the restaurant and the on line menu did not look good to me. I was wrong! I really enjoyed eating here. The Lunch was fantastic. I had the Bison Enchiladas. It was so good. I will be back here for lunch and dinner.  Day 2 for dinner. I think I like this place"}
{"text":"Oh my DELICIOUS!....Last night my son and I went there for dinner. I had the tortilla soup....it was so delicious that I bought 2 to take home for my daughter and her boyfriend.....so yummy.  My son had a burrito and loved that you could pick what meat and HEAT for the sauce....he loves HOT! I know I will be stopping there EVERYTIME I pass by....yum!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner one night after work and this place is the goods. Solid food with great choices. Atmosphere was pleasant and the staff was friendly. I would recommend it!"}
{"text":"If you like meats and salty foods, this place is for you! The selection of fillings and toppings is vast, but I'd like to see more variety of veggie fillings.  Didn't quite care for the spinach and mushroom filler.   Overall not bad, but on the salty side."}
{"text":"Why haven't I tried this place sooner?!?! I know that I have had it bookmarked forever so last weekend the hubby and I finally went there for a late dinner. This place seems to be popular with the hipster crowd before a night out at the bars so we just barely beat the rush.  It's a great concept. Pick your base (soup/tortilla/salad) then pick your protein (all very flavorful) and then add a bunch of toppings. And it gets put in the oven to melt the cheese on top and make it all delicious. I love the idea that you can get soup as the base so it can be a little more low-carb. The hubby and I tried all of their salsas and the guacamole and they were all delicious. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"With a movie under our belts, it was time for nourishment. What better place to so that than Gadzooks? This being our first time, I wasn't fully sure how to order, but with some assistance from the very friendly staff, we were able to get what we wanted. I ordered the green chile pork, red sauce and mixed cheeses. After a brief heating in their flaming oven, I had the hot (not the lava) salsa added, along with the crema. While I found the meat to be a little on the dry side, all the flavors popped wonderfully. It's just the right size portion to fill you up without stuffing you. I'll be back to eat my way through the menu."}
{"text":"Was in the area, tried this place out on a whim - I was definitely not disappointed! The layout is a little strange - I would place the menu and how you're supposed to order in a more customer-friendly area. I ordered the tortilla soup at the cash register, without realizing I should have done that at the beginning of the line where I ordered my street tacos. Anyway - I got the pork shoulder tacos with red salsa, coleslaw, jack cheese, and a side of guac. So friggin delicious! The soup wasn't my favorite - I'm used to a thicker tortilla soup, with actual tortilla strips in it. But, this is definitely a place I'll try again!"}
{"text":"Holy salty food, Batman!  0_o  I had dinner here on Friday with my husband and toddler daughter.  It was packed, but not nearly as packed as the other restaurant that we attempted to visit and left because there wasn't enough space for us.  We waited in line for a few minutes and finally it was our turn to order.  I shouted my order to the employee on the other side of the counter; over the deafening din of other people who were talking and eating and all the kitchen noise.  It's very noisy when that place it busy!   I ordered 2 enchiladas with the 50/50 flour/corn tortillas and the short rib for the filling.  I chose green enchilada sauce and cheddar cheese as my topping with some Pico de Gallo and buttermilk dressing.  For my little I got her a carnita taco with a side order of the sautéed spinach and mushrooms and some of the same buttermilk dressing on her taco.  My husband ordered two enchiladas: one was spinach and mushroom filling and the other a cornbread filling.  He had the red sauce on his enchiladas.   At the register I added on a grapefruit margarita and a fountain drink for my husband.   We paid around $32 for everything.  The inside was packed, so we ate on the outside patio.  The patio was also very busy and every table was taken so we could only find seating at the counter that runs along the face of the patio wall.  It was difficult to keep a toddler perched high atop the barstool so that was a bit of a challenge, but the twilight temperature outside was really perfect so some of the hassle of sitting out there was worth it.      My grapefruit margarita was very tasty, but the food is a different story.  I like salt, I use a good deal of it in my normal cooking because as a Sonoran desert dweller we need it in our systems to survive, but I can hardly remember a time where I'd been to a restaurant and the food was so over-salted that I couldn't finish eating.  That was the case on this visit, my husband complained of the same thing, despite the fact that he was eating a completely different kind of enchilada than I was!  Our toddler only picked at her food too, I suspected it was also the sheer saltiness of it.  The buttermilk dressing on my enchiladas and my daughter's taco was outrageously salty, the green enchilada sauce across my food was crazy salty, the short rib filling was heavily salted and I think there was even salt in the Pico de Gallo too.  Seriously, whoever is in the kitchen at Gadzooks NEEDS to step away from the saltshaker, the saltiness of everything overpowered the different flavors of the dishes and it was over the top.    I'll try this place one more time and if that visit goes poorly then I'm done.  This is my second try to understand what everyone else sees in this place.  :/"}
{"text":"My office staff of 24 ordered our food from Gadzooks today and I'm so impressed by their attention to detail for each individual order! One of the owners delivered our meals and he was nice enough to lay out each person's order with the name and receipt, as well as pairing them with a bag of chips and salsa of choice. A few of our people didn't specify what type of salsa they wanted, so the owner brought all three types! I must say their execution of our order was outstanding along with the food. We've gone out to Gadzooks before and service was excellent then, and this just shows excellence is in everything they do!"}
{"text":"I'd had Gadzooks on my list to try for awhile and I finally had the chance to pop in yesterday for lunch.  The ordering process was easy, with the help of the friendly employees.  It was a good thing it was not too busy while I was ordering, since I had a lot of questions!  Of course, people piled in at just the right time.    There are so many different, delicious options to add to your enchiladas, tacos or soup.  We ordered two soups and two enchiladas to share, but we didn't have much room for the enchiladas after we finished our soups!    The soup, incidentally, was not only filling, but delicious!  I had a \"cheat\" day and ate some chicken in my soup.  It was phenomenal and really worth it.  The soup seemed heavily salted, but the flavor was intense with the habanero salsa and cornbread that was added.  It was one of the best soups I have had at a restaurant (nothing can usually beat homemade).    The enchiladas that we ordered were bison (a nice treat) and braised short ribs.  I had a small bite and found them quite delicious with the fresh crema on top.  We had added the spiciest green salsa to the enchiladas prior to them being warmed and then added the habanero and the mild green to them when they came out.  That crema really pulled the flavors down a notch and made them even more decadent.  I am not a big meat eater, but I have always preferred bison when available.  In this case, I think I liked both the beef and the bison equally; they were seasoned well.  We even ordered some pumpkin cookies for dessert.  They were a little cakier than I expected, but I was indulging so... why not?  One of the kind employees came to check up on us once we were finishing our meal.  I know some other reviews had issues with the service, but I had none.  I will be back in the next couple weeks to try something else.  I will probably try the potato at that time, but I might be convinced to cheat again for this meal.  It was only $17 something for all the food you see in the pics I posted.  If you're spending that kind of money eating from a fast food chain, \"you're doing it wrong.\"  P.S. The bathrooms were some of the cleanest I have encountered in downtown Phoenix.  That has to be mentioned!"}
{"text":"Enchiladas the \"Chipotle\" way.  Choose flour or corn tortillas and then decide what you want.  Tell them if you want tacos or enchiladas and the only difference is the enchiladas they roll up and put enchilada sauce over them.  Nice different concept on tacos and enchiladas, good for a quick meal and something different."}
{"text":"I can't give five stars purely because I haven't physically been there, I've only had take out through work. So I can't say how the service is but the food is amazing!! It was very Chipotle style but with enchiladas. I love that you can do call ahead orders very practical for being in downtown phoenix next to a ton of business. I recommend checking it out, ASAP I loved it!!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure how I could be such a fan of this place and not have written a review!  Gadzooks!  Eee gadz!  And gee whillikers!    Gadzooks is located in the heart of midtown Phoenix.  It is on a very busy corner at 7th Street and Osborn.  But, fortunately, there are no valets for parking!  You may self park your own car and I love that.  I'm the odd ball yelper.  I don't go here for the Enchiladas.  I go here for the soup part.... Yeah, uhm....did you notice the word \"Soup\" in the name of the restaurant?  Hehe...  I love their tortilla soup so much that I could easily eat it a couple times a week.  You can chose the meat/toppings to add to your soup or chose the grilled veggies.  These options are the same for the tacos and enchiladas.  I also add a touch of Pico de Gallo and a bit of the Hot salsa.  Perfection in a bowl for me.  They also serve a corn chowder that I have yet to try.  Actually, I found my favorite item and I just basically stick with it.  Jajajajajaja!  Return factor:100%.... I'm headed there now."}
{"text":"First visit, and it delivered everything everybody said it would!! Worth the trip from Gilbert."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me by a friend for date night with my fiance. I was kind of skeptical because of some of the reviews, however our time here was very enjoyable! I heard that the staff could be unfriendly, yet they were extremely nice & helpful. There were so many options & they took their time to explain how it worked & what was available. I noticed that was consistent throughout the night, because they also helped a vegan customer customize her meal; which is very nice of them to do! And they did it willingly and without attitude. The food was really good. They offer a variety of meats, salsas and toppings. I have 2 enchiladas with red & green sauce & chicken inside. Very good! Salsa was fresh & their guacamole was yummy! My fiance had 3 enchiladas, 2 filled with green chile pork and one with bison, extremely good! We both enjoyed our time here. My fiance tried their grapefruit margarita & he said it didn't disappoint! The view on the outside patio was nice & it was nice to sit out on a beautiful evening in arizona! We will be back, because I need to try the spinach and mushroom tacos with jalapeno ranch dressing & cabbage!!!"}
