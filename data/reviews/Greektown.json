{"text":"Enjoyed Greektown.  Much better than other Greek places around that we have tried.  Did feel it was just slightly overpriced compared to portion but food was quite good.       I love cheesecake and was a little surprised they had a cheesecake as an option for dessert and it is clearly home made because they were baking it and had to see if it was done before we could order it. It was an exceptional cheesecake but also a little different than the usual cheesecake.  Guessing there is Greek yogurt in there but not sure.  Anyways, delicious!        This is a family run place so in my book that is a plus.  We left payment and tip on the table and left.  Next thing we know the owner George comes out into the parking lot to catch us to say thank you and goodbye.  Most places would not do that. Clearly shows they care."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Greektown. I am not from the area, and my coworker and I decided to give it a try. We were certainly not disappointed. The calamari was excellent. We also tried the Mediterranean Greek Salad and had a trio dish that was phenomenal. My favorite part of the meal was the baklava cheesecake. It was absolutely excellent and plenty for two people to share. If I'm ever back in the area, I will visit again!"}
{"text":"Awesome! Great experience. Owner is a really great guy. Good food. Will definitely come back when we visit Phoenix again! Get the baklava cheesecake!!"}
{"text":"For an authentic, home style experience, head North up 7th St. to Sumnyslope, past those noisy, over-hyped, over-lit, over-loud  hipster resto-bars. George & Anastasia (with sons Dinitri & Greg) serve authentic Greek delicacies, unmatched hospitality and the genuine feeling of being one of the family."}
{"text":"Just one word describes this place AMAZING!!!!!!!!! Everything was delicious. Everyone really needs to try Greektown. So good. Yum"}
{"text":"We recently moved to the area and this is BY FAR the best meal we've had in N Central Phoenix! George served us, and was perfection - everything he recommended was exceptional - we weren't going to get an app, but he sold us on the calamari and it did not disappoint!  The (little) remaining sauce was scooped up with bread, it was so delicious! Entrees come with soup (today, a chicken broth with lemon/garlic/onion that was well-balanced and delicous) and a salad, full of tomatoes, cucumbers, feta, peppers, kalamata olives - way too much food!  My husband had the special and I had Shrimp Grigori - devine sauce, tender shrimp, good ratios of crab.   $4 Pinot Grigio was a bargain, although round 2, George suggested a Greek white from Crete that was even better! We will DEFINITELY be back - don't hesitate to give Greektown a try!"}
{"text":"Wow.. What a great place!! I was enjoying the food so much I forgot to get pics for my review..Sorry.  George, the owner is as sweetheart. Upon his recommendation I had Aris Beer. A great light lager. There was so much on the menu that sounded delicious. He allowed me to split my appetizer and main entree. I had feta cheese and olives with a delicious hot pita bread and Tiropites which are a cheese puff pastry with feta and a side of their homemade Taziki sauce. I am not usually a Taziki fan but this was unbelieveable.  Before I knew it a salad (which I took to go with some baklava and eggplant go go) Baklava - hmm breakfast of champions?? Also a lemon, egg soup. Similar base as the lemon sauce they put on the domades. Yummy! My main entree consisted of a lamb skewer and Mousaka which is slices of eggplant sauteed in butter, layered with a spiced meat sauce topped with a becemel creme and a parmesan cheese. You could taste a faint hint of cinnamon in there too. Needless to say all that food, and 3 beers later I am in a serious food coma. I would definitely recommend this place. There are not too many mom and pop greek places in Phoenix. This place is great!! Family owned for many years. I met regulars who used to frequent the old location with George's father. His father also owned a greek place in Hollywood from 68-98...So if anyone knows greek food its George... Love this place!! Support local Phoenix businesses!!"}
{"text":"Aside from the fact that the owner is crazy/hilarious and advises your menu choices like you would imagine your loud Greek uncle to do - the food at Greektown is authentic and super tasty.  We started out with Pita, Saganaki, and a bottle of the authentic Greek wine that the owner insisted on :)  He also suggested that because we were such a large group we should order a few combo platters to share, which included rice, Fresh Salmon, Dolmades, Capama, and Pasticio.  All of which was incredibly delicious!  The owner also provided my friend with a complimentary glass of Windex (an Ouzo martini w/Blue Curacao) since it was her birthday.  I would definitely recommend GreekTown for a fun family-style environment and appetizing Greek eats!"}
{"text":"Can't Say it enough, This place rocks for authentic Greek food. The owner is really nice and funny as well.  I really enjoy the Gyros but they have a special that's really good and adds a bit of spice (if you like that) to the Gyro, Its my new favorite now. The salad is really good too and you cant beat the baklava.  The atmosphere is great for conversation and relaxing."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  Real authentic Greek food.  I grew up with two Greek uncles and the food here reminded me of the meals we used to share.   The price was very reasonable and the owner is super friendly!!!!  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The food was \"ok.\" Not fabulous. My moussaka was burned on the bottom. The rice had zero flavor. The veggies were limp. The dolmathes were bland. The kalamari would have been ok if not drenched in sauce, but they were tasty. The dessert - which was pushed on us, despite the fact we said we didn't care for any, was WAY too much. Cheesecake, topped with baklava, accompanied by white chocolate mousse. Sorry, but it was disgustingly way too sweet. Just one elegant piece of baklava would have been enough. Worst of all, the owner thinks he being charming. But he is loud and obnoxious and pushy. There were nearly 40 people in the restaurant when I went, and the owner was taking orders, serving food, and clearing entirely by himself. My date wanted a glass of pinot, which they had, but he insisted on giving her something he personally felt was better. Totally obnoxious know-it-all.  When I spend $40-50 on a meal - I want somebody to be kind and gracious. Not overbearing."}
{"text":"Excellent food - amazing calamari! Great service.    Our family enjoyed the meal from start to finish.   Thank you."}
{"text":"Hello, this hidden gem is the best. Take a date, go for prom or just stop by with your family and enjoy some awesome family style greek food. Great place, great prices and great ambiance and Greek food. Backstreet"}
{"text":"Great, local, family-owned restaurant. The owners are characters and entertaining. The food was some of the best Greek food I have found in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Love this place. Been inside to eat, nice ambience, great food! One of the few if only real greek places around, what most tend to review here are more Middle Eastern. Only place I know that does roast potatoes... as Greek food should be... not served with fries... Great roasted veggies, house soup, their olive oil and Greek salad, like I know from back east... Souvlaki fantastic, Tzaziki is great! I have not been able to make it down there much, but when I have ordered ahead for my husband to pick up and take home, the food is as good as ever! Something you cannot say about many restaurants with pick ups."}
{"text":"The food was great and the staff was even better. Very funny folks. Good basic restaurant. Knowledgeable staff. The baklava was great."}
{"text":"Great calamari in a lemon garlic sauce ...not heavy and fried like in my Lone Star State... George has a unique and vibrant personality....He let us try the licorice greek liquor . It's a must it you've never had it. This was my first time at a Greek restaurant and I will definitely be back the next time I'm in North Phoenix."}
{"text":"George is quite the character and will do what he can to make you happy. The food is excellent! We totally enjoyed ourselves and we will be back:)"}
{"text":"By far the best Greek food in Phoenix.  I will definitely be back.  It was great to finally find a place that has good gyro meat."}
{"text":"Excellent food, but even better enthusiasm from George. Was my first time there but definitely won't be my last. You will walk in as a stranger but leave as a member of the family."}
{"text":"Food was fine but I refuse to go back. Owner is arrogant and downright rude!  George got my order wrong, because he doesn't write anything down, and when I told him about it he had the audacity to tell me that I didn't order what I thought I ordered!   Are you kidding me??!!  No, thanks!"}
{"text":"Neighborhood gem! We had bread, calamari, soup, Mediterranean salad and the Classic gyro platter PLUS four fantastic glasses of red wine for a mere $52.  Don't hesitate!"}
{"text":"I read that the Best Greek Restaurant of Phoenix 2012 was Greektown, and immediately saw that it was very close to my house. So, my friend (part Greek) and I decided to go check it out.  It was a good decision. We ordered the calamari for an appetizer. It was the best I'd ever had though a couple were slightly overdone (for squids). I liked the fact that it wasn't heavily breadcrumbed like you normally find, and it was served in an olive oil, lemon, garlicky sauce. There was a tomato sauce in a ramekin that I just left off with for the most part (it wasn't anything special).  I ordered the special, Mix Trio--moussaka, spicy chicken, and pisc.... I don't know what it was but it was similar to moussaka only with potato and no noodles. She thought the moussaka was incredible. I thought it was good but I liked the pisc-whatever was better, lamb flavored with cinnamon, in a weirdly good combination. The chicken was good, clearly flame-seared and cooked right, but the sauce wasn't very spicy or interesting.  She ordered dolmades, and they were clearly not from a can like most places. Dill and mint flavored them, (the dill was a little surprising to me) and they were not sour or slimy.  Their salad dressing was subtle and we ate it after our meal to pack everything else in.  We also got dessert, the baklava cheesecake. It was a slice of baklava on a slice of cheesecake (garnished and dressed with honey and cinnamon). We couldn't eat it like that, the pressure to cut baklava would smash the cheesecake. We pushed it off and ate them separately. The baklava was good, but she's made better. The cheesecake was really good though, and maybe I'd suggest trying to figure out a way to make a baklava crust for it instead of the other way around?  So, I'd totally suggest it if you're anywhere near Sunnyslope and want some Greek food that's got some interesting herb/spice things going on. There were things we wanted to try that we didn't get but we probably will later."}
{"text":"Not Greek food by any stretch! Went for lunch and ordered the special named for the owner, and it was just a plate of slop. I wouldn't offer it to a dog."}
{"text":"I was hesitant to try Greektown because I've had some bad experiences at other Mediterranean restaurants in Phoenix--but I'm so glad I did.  The atmosphere is very comfortable and even romantic, with plenty of booth and table seating available (in addition to a bar). I heard quite a bit of Greek being spoken, which is definitely a good sign when it comes to ethnic restaurants.  The calamari appetizer was flavorful and not too chewy (a problem I tend to have with calamari). The dolmades were a perfectly portioned and tasty entree and were cooked to perfection. I had a glass of Greek wine, which was well worth the price ($9).  The owner was also my table's waiter, and he did a fantastic job of creating a friendly and welcoming environment. He was quick with recommendations, and even gave the table a free shot of ouzo after dinner.  It's a family-owned restaurant, and you can tell that they actually want you to have a good time. Greektown is well worth the visit."}
{"text":"Opa! This place was fantastic - we shared the calamari appetizer and it was perfect: not chewy. Assorted breads followed with a yummy taziki platter. Seafood with pasta was out of this world - and was definitely worth every bite. George's 'crazy dessert' put our bellies over the edge - but again: worth. Every. Bite. Cheesecake topped with a piece of baklava and white chocolate mousse. George and his sons provided outstanding and attentive service. Go to Greek Town. You'll love it."}
{"text":"Very impressed. Best Greek restaurant around. Plus the owner is the best. Definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"My friends and I went here a few months back and had a great time talking to the owner, his son and generally enjoying ourselves. Now, as a Greek from Athens, I was not expecting anything. But, was pleasantly suprised when I ordered the mousaka (eggplant) dish. The owner came out and told me it was his great grandmothers recipe, and I believe it! When you have had as much mousaka as me, you know what is different and what is good! Last thing to prove i loved this place, I actually remembered to come back and post this on Yelp months later... Good eatin people, trust me :)"}
{"text":"Was looking for a neighborhood local eatery. Was in the mood for Greek food. Found this place. It was exactly what I was looking for. Relaxed, quaint, traditional family owned spot. Great food. Started with a Greek beer,  ordered the Greek meat sauce pasta and added chicken as was recommended by George. George was great. He basically guided me through my dinning experience.  Salad was crisp and dressed well. Pita bread is awesome!! Entree was great, very solid. Again, George  recommended the baklava cheesecake, wow. Can go toe to toe with the butter cake at drinkwaters... That is saying a lot. Over all very very solid. This is a great family owned authentic Greek restaurant!!"}
{"text":"I took my daughter and Mom there Saturday, my daughters food was good but the dolmas were tough and leathery and not very tasty at all, and the eggplant dip was horrible. I would not recommend this place to anyone. Thumbs Down"}
{"text":"My husband and I celebrated our 11th anniversary at Greektown.  We found them in the Entertainment book and we love Greek food, so we decided to give it a try.  We had an overall great experience, with a couple of bummers mixed in.  Service:  Very good.  We had a mixture of a server and a server-owner (George).  Both men were very friendly, funny, attentive.  The owner offered to box up my one dolmades that was left and to smother it in the lemon sauce (there was not a lot of sauce left on my plate), which I appreciated.  They know how to sell their restaurant, for sure.  Ambiance:  I was pleasantly surprised.  It was perfect for an anniversary dinner - lit by candles, stained glass windows with Greek themes, really romantic at night.    The food:  1.  Saganaki:  THE BEST we have ever had.  There was a lot of sauce left with the cheese to dip the pita bread in.  On the first bite I was shocked by the taste of the alcohol (151) that was in the sauce, but I got used to it really quickly.  My husband just relished it.  We will come back again and again just for this dish!  2.  Aveglemono:  Lemon soup.  Very good - an opinion by both myself and my husband.  Came free with the meal.  3.  Greek salad:  Good.  Fresh with lots of feta.  The salad dressing was a little heavy / salad a little overdressed.  Free with the meal.  2.  Shrimp George entree:  Half and half on this one.  The flavors of lemon and artichoke were wonderful on this, and the vegetables with the sauce that they use were incredible.  Unfortunately, the shrimp were over-cooked - my husband with the chef's palate say they were REALLY over-cooked.  He said he would try the Chicken George next time.  3.  Dolmades entree:  Half and half on this one:  Again, the vegetables were wonderful.. and to be honest, I am not somebody that loves vegetables.  The dolmades were really unflavorful, unfortunately.  They weren't bad because grape leaves/rice/ground beef is a good combination any way you look at it, but they were probably the worst I have ever had just based on how unflavorful the rice and ground beef were.  The sauce was really good, though.  4.  Custard dessert:  A caramel custard.  My husband liked it.  5.  Baklava ON TOP OF cheesecake:  I really wasn't sure I wanted to try it.  The combination really does work, though!  The cheesecake alone wasn't the best cheesecake and the baklava alone also wasn't the best baklava but together it really was good!  My advice would be for the restaurant to make a sampler  dessert plate and have this dessert  in bite-size format with maybe 5 pieces.  It was amazing at the beginning, but it is really rich.    Overall, we were really pleased with this restaurant.  We would both order different entrees,, but the service/ambiance/saganaki/parts of the various dishes were really incredible."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried Greektown a couple days ago and are still talking about how much we loved it. The food was excellent and we loved the service. We would highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I have never written a review of a place before, but after dining at Greektown and being blown away countless times I am filled with the compulsion to get the word out to as many people as possible that this place exists. Without a doubt, Greektown is some of the best Greek food I've ever had. This place is really out of this world and George is an amazing host. The calamari is absolutely to die for-- as well as the spanakopita, and baklava cheesecake. If you've got  a hankering for some Grecian delicacies this is place oughta be your go to spot here in the valley."}
{"text":"Greektown is home to the best moussaka and calamari in the city, hands down. If you feel like comfort food, order the pastitsio, a Greek noodle casserole which probably carries enough calories to power a small city. If you're in for some lighter fare, try the fisherman's salad. Shrimp, squid and scallops punctuate this dinner-sized salad. Along with a bowl of George's sublime avgolemono soup, this is a hearty meal.  If you go, bring your sense of humor and tolerance for a little noise. Greektown is raucous fun in the best traditions of the Mediterranean disposition. Expect off-color jokes from the staff. Loosen up with a snifter of seven-star metaxa or a \"windex\", George's creation combining ouzo and other liquors.   The desserts are outstanding, from the chocolate mousse to the creamy rice pudding, and you'd have to be crazy not to try the baklava.  I've never had a bad meal at Greektown, and I've eaten there quite a bit. Drop in on George sometime. He'll treat you like family."}
{"text":"One of the few restaurants that have truly impressed me. Great atmosphere and great food. Gyros are to die for. The owner and his family really step it up and make this place awesome. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I'm really surprised by all the great reviews so I think we just came on an off night or maybe we are just used to really great Greek food from back home but the food was just ok. We got a Greek salad which was just ok nothing special and the lamb over orzo. My husband is Greek so he has had many lamb dishes and he thought it was fine but would not order again. Everyone was really nice just too bad it didn't live up to expectations."}
{"text":"Greektown is not good.  The gyro is not good.  It tastes microwaved.  I can't stand the frozen gyro slices.  If you like lettuce with Italian dressing for a salad then come here.  If you want the best gyro in AZ go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I had lunch here for the first time the other day.  I was blown away with the calamari.  Best I ever had.  The service was great and the Mexican spin on the spicy gyro was great.  The salad was fresh and very tasty.  I highly recommend and plan on many more trips."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!!! My friends and I came here because of the reviews and boy were they right! We started with the calamari and it was delicious! We all agreed! I had the Pasteeto and a side of the George's chicken and it was soooo flavorful and perfectly seasoned, just delicious! Our meals came with soup and that was tasty as well! The owner was our waiter and he was so much fun and personable! There was a family celebrating a birthday while we ate and after happy birthday was sung they threw a plate against the wall and everyone said \"OPAAA\" it was so awesome!! We loved it! The food, staff, atmosphere was just 5 star all the way. Oh and we had the cheesecake with a chunk of baklava on the top of it and it was to die for!! So dang good!! This is my new fav place!! Will be bringing the rest of my friends and family here!!"}
{"text":"The food here is great.  We had  a lot of appetizers.  The calamari and the Greek salad are great.  There was  also a cheese dish that was good...it went well with the fresh pita and bread brought to the table.  We tried many items based on recommendations of the owner/server.  He was very attentive and chatty.  My main course was a grilled chicken gyro, although it was very good the veal that my gf got was excellent.  Everybody at our table loved their food.  The owner even brought us all shots of ouzo before we left...excellent with the rice pudding.  I'll be back here for sure."}
{"text":"The food was authentic and amazing. Had the spanakopita as an appetizer and it was as good as ones I've eaten in Greece. Then had the classic gyro. The tzaztiki sauce was to die! We also had the baklava for dessert, which was amazing. I asked for the owners recommendation for one of the flavored ouzo after dinner drinks and tried \"the windex\". Everything was so yummy and we had a fun experience. Our 9 month old was being a bit fussy so the owner walked him around the restaurant a bit to entertain him which was so cute. Would definitely come back here often, the atmosphere is also great for a date night"}
{"text":"We didn't care for Greektown.  We came here on the recommendation of my husband's co-worker - one who barely eats, and is NOT Greek, so we should have known better.  We had a very large party, and George gave us a quote in advance.  The bill far exceeded the quote, even though we were served what we were quoted, and nothing more.    The dips were the best part of the meal, but far too little pita to enjoy - and we felt like we were being a bother by asking for more.  George and his staff appeared annoyed even though we were very respectful and simply didn't want the delicious dips to be wasted!  It's not like we were trying to fill up on bread, we had already paid for the entire meal.  We also opted for a baklava dessert @ $3 per person.  It was maybe a 1/4 piece of baklava each... sincerely disappointing.  As a big, fat Greek group, we were expecting the food to taste authentic.  It didn't.  Some of the worst pastitsio I've ever had - and cold, too.  If he did use lamb, I feel awful that the lamb died to end up in that dish.  In summary, even though Greektown is close to home, it's not worth the drive.  Maybe he does a better job with single tables, but I won't take that chance."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Greek restaurant I've eaten at. Their lamb dishes were wonderful. The owner is friendly and engaged us in conversation. The service was great. Overall awesome dining experience."}
{"text":"I've found it! This is it! The best Greek restaurant in Phoenix! For years now I had been wondering if an excellent Greek restaurant even existed here. Like Bigfoot, it seemed ever elusive, almost as if it didn't want me to find it! Well I found you, you rascal, and I'm not letting you get away. I even took pictures... wait. I didn't take pictures. I forgot. But I swear it exists! I swear it!  What is the deal with most Greek joints, anyway? You go in and you get food made with rice and pork and grape leaves and you get the bill and you're like \"wtf mate?\" Then your wife reminds you that you're not Australian and you get all sheepish... but I digress. Unlike pricier joints around town which will go unnamed, prices here were right in line with what I would expect to pay. A nice touch. Service was a bit slow on the uptake, but once we got our order taken, everything came very quickly. The true star of the show here though, is the food. So delicious!  Until I ate at Greektown, I thought I did not like pita bread all that much. If this is how pita was made everywhere, it would have been one of my favorites since childhood, this stuff is awesome. We ordered dolmades to start, grape leaves stuffed with rice and pork smothered in a light lemon sauce... fabulous. Eye-rollingly so. Seriously. I had the Greek salad with grilled chicken, the yardstick I apply to all my Greek experiences. The salad was competent, but the dressing was very bland. Surprising, considering how tasty everything else was.  Squeezed a bit of lemon over it though, and it came to life - it was AWESOME. The chicken was seasoned and grilled perfectly. Tender and tasty, a true pleasure. It came with a side of tatziki, by the way, very delicious. I was a happy camper. The wife ordered what she described as \"the best gyro I have ever had in my entire life.\" I know that's a tad ambiguous. I try to nail her down on these things, but she INSISTS on being vague. Sorry!  Lastly, everybody is saying it and there's a reason: the guy who runs this place is definitely the ringmaster here, he's very fun and also an excellent server. He is quite obviously enjoying what he is doing, and I applaud his atttude. More to the point, I applaud his food. We will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Great food. Very friendly atmosphere. Authentic Greek cuisine. Owners are easy to talk with and welcoming."}
{"text":"I have been to Greektown about five or six times now and will continue to go back for their consistently delicious, satisfying food.  I've also had the experience of ordering food for take-out which has always been fresh and ready quickly.  As far as I can tell, as an American who has never been to Greece, it is authentic Greek cuisine.  The owners are friendly and welcoming and appear to take pride in what they do.  I continuously order the gyro because it is so tasty, filling, and comes with a yummy little salad.  I have gone with several different people, some very picky, who have all loved it there-- from the food and the service to the charming paintings on the walls. I have also had the delicious calamari which far exceeds the quality found at most restaurants as it is not thickly battered and deep fried to the point where you're not even sure it's calamari at all. Also incredible is the baklava (and I never enjoyed baklava before).  I had it once with cheesecake and it was incredible and took me a couple of days to eat at home because it was rich and filling. Do yourself a favor and try this place.  I am about 99% sure you will be supporting a family rather than a chain and you will get to taste some amazing food which, again, I'm about 99% sure is authentic."}
{"text":"LOVE! Great service, magnificent food!"}
{"text":"This place has been around for a long time and I've been eating here since the 90s. It's a diamond in the rough, the building and neighborhood don't do the food justice. It's a family restaurant that's been handed down, and I have never been in there and not seen the owner. He cares about his customers and his food, and he's fun to chat with. They have a great selection of wines and beers, and there are always lots of specials. This is a great place to take a date (or the wife for date night). The atmosphere inside is intimate and welcoming. If you ask the waiter or owner what's good tonight, you get an honest answer, and I like that. I often go with their recommendations. Now, this may not sound good at first... but they have a desert called a Baklava Cheesecake. It's cheesecake with baklava on top. You'd think that would be too sweet, but it's not and it's great, one of my favorite deserts anywhere. If you're looking for upscale Mediterranean dining in a friendly and intimate atmosphere, you can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"Not only is the food, atmosphere, and service excellent- but the owner George is very pleasant. You will not be disappointed! This is our second time coming here and we've made it a tradition to come once a week or so, because the experience is off the charts. Prepare yourself for the best Greek food and experience you'll ever have."}
{"text":"this place was great! we stumbled in for lunch and ended up very happy with the home cooked authentic greek food and the owner/server was so fun and charming.  the best pita bread ever!"}
{"text":"Not sure if Friday nights are usually as crowded as this particular night, but we ended up waiting 35 minutes for them to set a table up for a party of 9, when we were told that it would be \"about 10-15 minutes\".  The food was average.  For Greek food, we usually go to Crazy Jim's on 15th Ave and Indian School, which is awesome, but doesn't have much room for large parties.  The owner (I think) was very friendly and worked very hard, but we could not get over the mediocrity of the food.  The tow stars that I'm giving it are for the following; 1) cheesecake baklava (OUTSTANDING!!!) and 2) the friendly man who served us.  Other than that, we won't be returning."}
{"text":"Great service from the owner George who was personable and friendly! We ordered carry out and we had the appetizers dolmades, mushrooms tasoula and a classic gyro....the dolmades were tender and the lemon sauce delicious! The mushrooms also were so flavorful and we loved the garlic sauce...finger licking good!  The gyro was tender and very flavorful and the tsatziki sauce was perfect! Great to have found a new neighborhood restaurant with great food as well as great service....Thanks Vassiliou family!"}
{"text":"The minute you walk in the door, the atmosphere is delightful. I've never been to the Mikonos, but I can only imagine the feel of it from being in this restaurant. The paintings and decorations are beautiful.  Now, the food is outstanding. Great saganaki and salads. Also had tortellini alfredo, which was excellent. The staff is extremely amiable and service is just right. Overall, a great experience"}
{"text":"A random stop on our way to another restaurant. We were not disappointed. Excellent food.  Authentic Greek food. The gyro and pita were flavorful, fresh, and hit the spot. As a Greek novice, I cannot recommended this restaurant enough!"}
{"text":"You would be doing yourself a huge disservice by passing up this hidden gem.  The perfect  interplay of light flavors in all the food I've tried so far (spicy lemon chicken, dolmades, calamari, balaclava cheesecake, Turkish coffee)   coupled with the light tab at the end of the meal make Greektown an unforgettable treat.  I moved here from New York and the cheesecake I ate tonight rivals that of Juniors in NYC (I can't explain how rare that is). I'm lucky enough to live close-by, and I've found a new favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"The owner greeted us with a very warm welcome as we entered the place and offered to have us wait at the bar while they got a table ready for us.  The whole staff was very attentive and friendly and the food was authentic and excellent!  I recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"One word \" AMAZING \" ..... This place is all around wonderful. Fantastic food, welcoming and relaxing atmosphere. Somewhat romantic in my opinion. The owners are so friendly, family run and completely homemade authentic food. If you ask them to make you hummus, be prepared to eat the best in town."}
{"text":"Don't judge a book by its cover. Because if you do, you will miss out on some yummy Greek food!   We have driven by this place a million times and finally decided to give it a try. So glad we did. Love the Santorini Island decor with hand painted murals. Such a cute place.   We will be back and with our friends for sure!"}
{"text":"Just finished having the best Greek dinner!!! The gyros plates were just wonderful! Lots of meat, meal came with delicious lemon soup, Greek salad, veggies and rice. The crowning point of the meal was the baklava cheese cake covered in a deli ious white chocolate sause. Service was tremdous! How George manages taking all those orders, getting them right when he doesn't  write anything down  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"}
{"text":"Great authentic Greek food  in authentic Greek setting.  Owner-operated Gem ... very welcoming.  Must have the special baklava desserts ...I had the one with white chocolate mousse... mmm good!  Must visit when in Phoenix ... whether you are a local or a visitor from ... let's say, Boston!  Dan Marino says \"Dont PASS it by!\""}
{"text":"Always a great meal!  Try the zesto gyro...spicy kick. Yummy!"}
{"text":"This place is an absolute gem of a restaurant. If you havn't been here, you're missing out. I went for the first time tonight with some friends and had an absolute amazing experience. We met George the owner and when people talk about \"the charm of going to a family restaurant\" this is what they are talking about. Incredible food and heres a tip... if he asked if you saved room for desert... don't say no. Make this desert your cheat meal... you wont regret it."}
{"text":"I came in just passing by I was starving and I am so happy I decided to try it. George is so awesome very welcoming and enthusiastic about how great the food and boy he wasn't lying best spanakopita and gyros we will be back!!! Some of the best hospitality I have seen in a long time!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service, the owner George talks to everybody and very friendly. I go for lunch since it is close to work and very convenient. Love the moussaka there but everything I have ate there has been great. Will be returning again and again and hoping to check it out for dinner soon."}
{"text":"The food is amazing! You can't find better Greek food in Phoenix. I will definitely be back for more Greek food and music"}
{"text":"It was amazing!  A buddy and I randomly decided that Greek sounded good and this definitely held up to it.  The flavors were great, the owner was authentic, and the Tzatziki was amazing!  Definitely going to head back there :)"}
{"text":"Outstanding food !! The owner is a real cut up cracking jokes one after the other . His son is a waiter and his wife does the cooking.  I hated to leave when I was done dinning . You even get a hug before u leave.. can't wait to return ."}
{"text":"i was in phoenix about a year ago, and i still remember this place. the food was very fresh and delicious, and the place had a nice friendly ambience. a definite thumbs up."}
{"text":"The food was ok. George was very entertaining! The calamari was good and since I didn't have it anywhere else it does live up to George's best in the city."}
{"text":"Foods pretty good; however, owner..............creepy and clearly hates Turks.  I'm not Turkish by any means, but keep your political stance/opinions out of the bar area."}
{"text":"I have been there many times recently and always have a great meal.  The service is excellent, the food is great. I usually get the Greek salad with gyro meat and great tzaziki sauce. George, the owner suggested the baklava cheesecake last time. It was all homemade and absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood joint, solidly delicious freshly made Greek food.  Seems to be family run and the staff is quite charming and lively.  Decent selection of beer & wine (ouzo cocktails, even!). Nice place!"}
{"text":"Greektown serves some of the best Greek food in Phoenix. The uniquely Greek atmosphere and delicious food (Chargrilled chicken gyro is my personal favorite) make this a great lunch spot.  The pita bread is easily the best I've ever had. Definitely recommend this spot to anyone who likes all things Greek."}
{"text":"Go see George for the best Greek and Mediterranean food in Phoenix. I can only compare it to Greektown in Chicago it is so good."}
{"text":"Been eating at Greektown for almost ten years. I have only the highest praise. The food is authentic and tasty. Good sized portions...we have never left hungry.  Fair prices, comfortable atmosphere (beautiful murals!) and good, friendly service. Even for lunch, great selections....those Gyros are sure to satisfy any appetite. I have personally never had a problem with service. The owner can be loud and boisterous, but what Greek isn't? Opa!"}
{"text":"I went to this place when I lived in Phoenix in the 80's and I went back on a recent visit. Great food and George is so accommodating. I will always eat here when I am in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This is now our favorite Greek restaurant. Everything on the menu looked delicious. We both loved our meals, the appetizer, soup and salad.  Not only did we get food advice but also travel advice for our trip to Greece.   Everyone so friendly."}
{"text":"I've walked on the USS Enterprise's Transporter! One minute I'm in Phoenix and the next I'm at a Greek family's home. I was welcomed with a glass of Ouzo as if I was the lost Uncle Frank not seen for years!    I sat at the bar (which I never do) to chat with the owner. He tells this restaurant has been around for 42 years and it's easy to see why.     The Mediterranean Greek Salad with grilled chicken for $11 was my order. Wow! I am truly have left Phoenix for Greece! The lettuce cold and crisp, tomatoes, cucumbers and Kalamata Olives are fab too! Coming back tonight for dinner- it's that good!"}
{"text":"Solid menu, big portions, great prices! The building is a little unassuming, but some of the best places are. This place has great charm and even better food. Family owned and ran. Food has quality ingredients and is awesome.  Try the Calamari- best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Oh. My. Gosh. I'll preface this by saying I'm half Greek so I'm pretty hard to please with Greek food. This was PHENOMENAL! The calamari was fresh, cooked perfectly and then coated in an amazeballs lemon garlic sauce. The bread basket was awesome, fresh garlic bread and pita. Then the salad came out... With a fantastic and light dressing that didn't overpower the veggies. The pastitsio was as good as my yiayia makes it, and the patates and veggies that came with were seasoned perfectly and absolutely delicious. The baklava cheesecake, OMG. So freaking fantastic!!   The owner is a character and hilarious, plus friendly and so welcoming. This is a definite must go if you love Greek food, are Greek and picky, or just a regular joe that has never had Greek food and want to try it! Go go go!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The food is spectacular, the atmosphere is very fun, especially for birthdays (broken plates and all). You arrive as a customer and leave feeling like family. This is a very special restaurant!"}
{"text":"Once in awhile while traveling on business you say \"I'm going to get out of my hotel\" and you skip all the chains and you try a local place and you get lucky. This was one of those times. This is a memorable place with very good food and reasonable prices. This is a great find. If I lived in Phoenix I'd be here all the time."}
{"text":"We decided we wanted something new.  So, I of course turned to Yelp to help us.  After reading some of the reviews, we decided upon Greektown.  When we pulled into the parking lot there was only one car...I wasn't sure if that was a good sign or not.  Upon entering, we were immediately greeted by the owner and were told that we could sit anywhere we'd like.  We chose one of the booths, it was nice and cozy and private.  There were several specials written up on the wall, but they were all meaty, so I took to the menu.  On this particular night, I was hankering for some cheese...don't judge me.  My lady was looking at the Spanikopita (baked phyllo dough stuffed with spinach and feta) and I wanted to get the Tiropita (baked phyllo dough stuffed with feta), as we were trying to decide which one to get, our server (the owner) offered to do half and half for us.  Sweet!!  As we were waiting for the appetizer, he brought us out some fresh pita and tasty garlic bread.  When the app came out, it was piping hot and oh so good!  Came with a side of Tzatziki for dipping, but I just ate mine plain.  For entrees, I ordered the pasta with veggies (tomatoes, mushrooms, zucchini, red onion) which came with a choice of their tomato sauce or the lemony garlic.  I opted for the lemony garlic.  Our entrees came with little Greek salads, which came out with the meals.  I liked my dish...although I did have to order a side of lemon wedges cause I love things extra tart.  I can't remember exactly what my girl ordered, but I know there was rice and potatoes and tomato sauce, and she ate almost all of it.  The salad was only so so...it had creamy dressing and I wanted a little more punch from it...perhaps a little acid in there to kick it up a bit.  The portions were very generous and we both needed a take out container.  Don't think we stopped there, though!  We ordered the house-made chocolate mousse.  It was DAMN delicious!  We ate every last spoonful.  The owner was a very nice and helpful guy, not too much and not too little.  As I said before, the portions are large and the prices are not.  Check it out, you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Had an excellent salad here for lunch - the Mediterranean Greek. It was pretty big, and with chicken on top was only $10. It came with a nice warm pita, side of tzatiki and dressing. They gave me extra tzatiki at no-cost. It's a family-owned place and I enjoyed meeting the owner (who worked behind the bar)."}
{"text":"We've eaten at Greektown for almost 25 years! We love George's humor . He's a man with a golden heart.  This is not fast food,  and all the food is fantastic! The standard Greek dishes are to die for, we love the calamari, the Capama ( lamb shank), the Musaka, spanakopita, saganaki, domales, etc. We also love the chicken and seafood dishes, too!   Our family loves to come to Greektown to eat the wonderful food and visiting with George and his family!"}
{"text":"We used to live just up the street and pop in here whenever we had the craving for authentic and excellent home cooked Greek dishes.  George, the owner, always is quick witted and makes your dining experience unforgettable! Tonight I had the special, snapper with clam sauce, my wife had the mix trio, and George made my daughter a pita with chicken and cheese.  Before our meal we chose to start out with dolmathes, spanakopita, and saganaki....all were incredible and NOTHING was left to waste!  We were eating as if it were our last meal and that's just a testament to the incredible experience your mouth will delight in during your time spent here. We were excited to try their version of baklava, George describes it as baklava on crack, and it is!  It was delicious! We took a couple of sample bites and had to take it home for later and as we went to take our leave we said our goodbyes to George and his son Dimitri as though we were saying farewell to family.  Thanks for everything it was another unforgettable dining experience!"}
{"text":"Been coming to this place for years. Lunch/dinner/ doesn't matter. Food is always great as is the atmosphere.   Best Greek food around, hands down."}
{"text":"Such a wonderful experience.  The food was delicious and the owner comes to your table to act as head waiter.  We were able to try new things and loved it all.  They were kid friendly and very affordable.  We will definitely be back!  Note they are closed until July 21st, 2017 as they take an extended vacation back to Greece."}
{"text":"The best Greek food I have ever eaten. I have unfortunately driven past this place for the last year. Definitely a new favorite!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Greek restaurant. The waiter was funny and knowledgeable, and recommended all of the best things, of course... he would tell you everything is the best, and it is certainly hard to argue that!  Everything we had was delicious, the specials are well priced for the quantity of food you get... and the $4 wine deal is a perfect little treat."}
{"text":"This is a great local Greek Restaurant. The owner is a really nice guy and makes sure you feel at home. The food reminds me of the cuisine I recall in the Tavernas of Poros and Hydra. I was here on business and would be a regular if I lived here."}
{"text":"A disappointing evening. We made reservations, and upon arrival, the owner's son said there were people without a reservation that got there before us, and they had to be seated first.  50 minutes later, we were seated, hoping for good Greek comfort food. Unfortunately, the spanakopita was bland, essentially free of feta, and under-filled. The tiropites were similarly bland and sparse of filling.   The salad was heavily dressed with a generic Italian bottled-style dressing and the avgolemono soup had hardly any rice or chicken (tiny bits of chicken that were overcooked and chewy).   The pastitso was rich and soothing, while the dolmades were wonderfully flavorful, albeit small of portion. The entrees were accompanied by apparently boiled vegetables.  We had hoped for much more..."}
{"text":"An authentic, home cooked Greek meal at a reasonable price in a family style atmosphere!  Hard to beat!!"}
{"text":"We had the most wonderful dinner at this restaurant, everything we ordered was fabulous....!!!! The owner and his family are super, never had as great a time for an evening out.... My birthday was so much more enjoyable because of their hospitality and excellent cuisine.... The baklava chocolate cheese cake with vanilla cream mousse is heavenly.... They made me a cheesecake lover.... We will return many times, it is now our #1 restaurant in the valley....  There are so many items on their menu we are going to try.... You won't just sit and have a meal, you will be entertained with humor and enjoy the most excellent dining experience of a life time..... We'll be back next week so many great foods to enjoy, remember my teramousalata .... Dott.... We loved Greektown....!!!!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal--George is full of personality and has put together such an authentic and welcoming Greek restaurant experience!  It's a little surprising from the outside and surrounding area but upon entering it was like we stepped right into a restaurant in Greece, heavily decorated and playing traditional Greek music.  George was incredibly hospital--it was like we had entered his home.  He loves what he does, and that passion is apparent in the recipes he serves with the highest integrity.  Everything we ate was delicious and some serious comfort food (literally, we were in a food coma by the end).  I can't wait to return to try the baklava cheesecake and the calamari people raved about... We loved the lamb, saganaki (OPA!!), and the tiropitakia!  Those of you who have Greektown in your neighborhood are spoiled--I would be there all the time!"}
{"text":"I remember when this used to be a Country Boys restaurant, my bff and I ate eggs and hashbrowns here before going horseback riding for her birthday.  Oh but I digress...this place is boss. Why? Because they don't stop feeding you! You start off with a basket of warm pita bread, and that bread never stops coming. Delightful. After that, a bowl of lemony rice soup that is warm and refreshing at the same time and then your entree. And believe me, everything is good.  The only dish that I have ever been mildly disappointed with was the Moussaka, I wanted to try it and it really wasn't my cup of tea. Maybe it was the pureed eggplant.  Not enough for you? My family always asks for an appetizer sampler in which they give you a variety of cheeses, dips and spinach and cheese puffs. I highly recommend it, it's a great way to get to know the food and stuff yourself silly!  Wonderful cozy atmosphere, lovely staff, a great date restaurant. One of my favorites."}
{"text":"The mousaka is decadent! The calamari is perfectly cooked! I'm not sure if it's the owner who took our order but it's personable, quaint great place for a date!!"}
{"text":"So good!  George, the owner, was funny and provided quick and great service.  The food was amazing.  We had the flaming cheese and calamari (the sauce was so flipping good).  For main course we had the Gyro Platter and Lamb Shanks.  Everything was perfect.  My girlfriend and I were the last ones in the restaurant, so George dimmed the lights without any prompting.    Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I see lots of great reviews so there isn't much I can add. Greektown is owned and operated by a Greek family. Enough said! You can't get service like this anywhere else and that's just something you have to experience for yourself. Ask for George and if it's your birthday make sure to tell him! OPA!!  I usually get the Classic Gyro Dinner Platter or Titan's Tortellini with the Greek meat sauce! You get a salad and soup of the day with dinner entrees. My favorite so far is the lentil soup; it's really good."}
{"text":"I am going to make this real simple. The best Greek food I've had. You cannot go wrong with anything on the menu. Absolutely delicious ! Opa!!!!!"}
{"text":"We arrived into Phx on an evening flight making our way to Sedona for the weekend & we found this treasure. We love Greek food especially after our trip to Santorini. George the owner was incredibly nice & friendly and despite it being almost closing time he offered a complete menu. Yummy food & great service!"}
{"text":"Giorgos, the restaurant owner, is a polymath of wine, olive oil and all things Greek.  He also makes a very good meal.    My wife and I walked in on an early weekday evening, and were immediately seated.  We decided to order all nine appetizer dishes to get a variety of foods and to sample the menu.  This was a reasonable way to do so, but we also left with three boxes of leftovers -- the orders are plentiful.  While my wife just drank water, I ordered a Greek red wine, which was full bodied and tasty.  The owner's family owns four vineyards in the Corinth area of Greece, and the wines onsite are representative of the annual harvests there.   We didn't get to the dessert because we simply didn't have enough room for any, but were told that the baklava cheesecake is very good.    If you don't mind the story-telling, theater and back and forth between customers and owners, then you'll love this experience.  If you want a quiet place for romance or to read a book, better try something else.  It was an easy and pleasurable choice for us.    The spincah-filled version of the spanokopita was particularly tasty as was the horiotaki table salad.   But all items were enjoyable,  Just download the menu sfor a full explanation of what goes into each dish.    There is a parking lot next to the restaurant which sits on the side of a busy two-way street."}
{"text":"Okay, you all know I love my Middle Eastern/Mediterranean food and how I've driven passed the place for 17 years and never stopped in is beyond me and Im kicking myself.  This is hands down the best Greek Restaurant in the valley hands down!!  Service was fast for our large party, the appetizers were fantastic with hummus, walnut hummus, and a potato spread. The Flaming Opa! was out of this world and the cheese was spiced and a good consistency. As always I went with the Gyro Plate dinner - again they knocked it out of the park!!  The menu is fairly comprehensive, the decor is what you would expect, but you need to stop and try this place!  Fantastic job Greektown! I am a Fan!!"}
{"text":"Great Gyro - Don't ask for French Fries -  YIKES! Love the atmosphere, customer service was great & to the point!!!!"}
{"text":"I got there late for lunch, but was welcomed in, an had a great meal.  The crab stuffed mushrooms were delicious the grilled chicken was excellent and the vegetables were not overcooked they were perfect.  I was talked into dessert which was a cheesecake with baklava topping and a white chocolate whipped cream on the side that was exceptional!  I am looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"The cheesecake baklava was to die for! I thought I died and went to heaven when I took my first bite of that creamy crispy goodness! It is sooo good I will have my man drive far and wide to get us another slice!  The Greek salad was good too."}
{"text":"Being Greek a goal everywhere I go is to find good Greek food.  I decided to give this place a try after looking at the website and the menu seemed to have all of my favorites on it.  Got there a little after five and was immediately greeted and seated.  George was welcoming and gave us recommendations.  I had the dolmades (grape leaves) as an appetizer and they were delicious.  The salad was smaller than what I normally have in a Xoriatiki and didn't have enough feta cheese on it.  The Pastitsio was on point with the bechamel being just the way I like it.  The baklava cheesecake ended the meal just right!  Super rich and delicious.  We will definitely be visiting again!"}
{"text":"Looking for a new Greek restaurant now that My Big Greek Restaurant closed. Decided to give it a try. Now I am thankful that My Big Greek Restaurant is gone! Super friendly owner. Staff is excellent. Food is awesome. Better food than I ever got back in Greektown in Detroit. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Just based on the looks of things at Greektown I would have left the building if I weren't with a coworker. It is definitely in need of a upgrade/remodel. I think there was only one person working at the time or maybe a chef in the back as well he was extremely nice. I ordered the gyro plate and it came with a Greek salad. I have only been to a couple Greek places but the meat here was mediocre compared to my past experiences. That was the first Greek salad that I have ever had. It was good but it didn't blow me away. For dessert we shared a baklava cheesecake. That was the best part of the meal. It was a really rich so I would recommend sharing. A few bites of it will definitely satisfy your sweet tooth."}
{"text":"GEART food and amazing atmosphere. George is amazing and will make feel very welcome. This is one of the BEST Places in Phoenix by far."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place.  I don't care that the building's a thousand years old.  I don't care that it was decorated in 1972.  I think George is friendly, funny, and interesting.  But, I do see where some would find him intrusive and overbearing.  The food is awesome.  The calamari is one of the best I've ever had.  The best meals I've had are when I just ask George what's good today and tell him to bring it on.  Yep, don't order anything.  Just let him know what courses you want and let him craft a meal for you.  Except for the calamari, definitely order that."}
{"text":"I prefer my Greek food without bellicose chauvinism thank you."}
{"text":"Don't get fooled by the outside of this restaurant. It's very nice inside, clean and very Greek. The mousaka was delicious, not over powering on the spices. The potatoes were perfect and so were the fresh carrots and broccoli. Service was exceptional."}
{"text":"I'm from Salt Lake City, and I really haven't had good Greek food since I left there.   Well last night I found it at Greektown.  The service was great, the food was fantastic.  We enjoyed the Melitsano Salata as an appetizer.    Served with delicious warmed pita bread it is a great way to start out your dinner at Greektown.    George, the owner, is very enthusiastic about his place and what he has to offer.   Take the time to get to know him.  He has lots of stories.  Make sure to ask him about the photo he has of Jimmi Hendrix.    The gyros are great here.  We like the Grexican.  All of the Greek dishes are great.  As George likes to say \"everything is fantastic, you should get it.\"    We go to Greektown often and always enjoy it.  It also seems to be gaining a great reputation as the business there has definitely picked up.  We're very happy it has.  This is a great local business to support!  Greektown is fantastic.  You should go."}
{"text":"Yelp, you're usually so good with your recommendations, but you really let us down with this one.   The service here is great.  The waiter was efficient and friendly. The ambiance is nice and the food is reasonably priced.    But that's where the praise ends...  We had the calamari (which the waiter raved about) and the eggplant spread.  The eggplant spread was delicious, the best thing we had.  The calamari was covered in a thick sauce which didn't have much flavor and left the calamari soggy without a satisfying crunch.  We both ordered the \"Chicken George\", which like all dinner items came with soup and salad (like I said: a great deal). The soup was ok. Not great.  But ok.  Pretty bland chicken egg drop. The salad was the worst Greek salad I've ever had.  It tasted like ranch dressing.  No olives.  No oregano.  Totally missed the mark.  The Chicken George was covered in a gross buttery sauce.  Again no Greek favors such as garlic or oregano.  A real disappointment.   We won't be coming back."}
{"text":"What a find.  Great place.  Very clean, food is amazing, and the owner George was great.  He was by himself since we arrived at 2 and lunch ends at three.  So he was server cook and bar tender.  He did a great job, with a smile in tacked.  Calamari was great, although I would have sliced it thinner(personnel preference).  We were in an unfamiliar area and found a gem.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Removing a star for the following:  Just got charged 72 dollars for the \"ethnic plate\" (a combination of portions of sausage, lamb, macaroni pie and--rather dry--fish). Apparently, the owner thinks that he can charge people the price of the highest-cost entree on his menu and multiply that by the number of people dining when serving the \"ethnic plate.\" How is this justified? The \"ethnic plate\" was clearly not made up of only the most expensive menu items.  On the bright side, the eccentric owner was still extremely entertaining and accomodating. When I requested extra bread to take home, he presented us with a nice-sized stack of fresh pitas. Also, our dessert sampler was delightful and included nice-sized portions.  I would return, but would be more careful about asking the exact price of any specials before ordering."}
{"text":"We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner. The food was delicious and the service was exceptional.  The white chocolate baklava cheese cake was absolutely delicious. Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday at about 5 p.m. Our waiter . let us to a table by window and said that we would have a good view of the crackheads. He entertained us throughout, it was like a dinner and a show. Our Appetizer was delicious it was a dip like that ziki sauce with a kind of lemon or Italian dressing oil around it and cucumber and tomato. This place has the most delicious Brad I took my gyro home with me because it was too hot to eat at the restaurant and my sister was done before I even had a chance to start. That is bread not Brad. I could not correct this earlier although I tried several times question?!  What gyro was good too. The tzatziki sauce is different from what I've had in the past, it seems to have diced cucumber in it and it's a bit thicker than usual. I would come back for the bread and the appetizer and the owner!! XXX"}
{"text":"What a charming family owned business! I do appreciate the atmosphere, the wonderful waiter and the owner stopping by at our table to make small conversation. The food was delicious and this place had authentic Greek food! A entertaining place as there were people celebrating various occasions and well let's just say there were dishes flying and people saying Opa! Hopefully I'm spelling that correctly!because truthfully there were a lot of Opa's that were said during the time frame that I was there. This is a hidden gem of a restaurant and definitely will be returning- and promise not to close the place down! We were literally the last people to leave this wonderful Greektowm restaurant! If you love Greek food then definitely check this friendly family owned restaurant! Enjoy! Be prepared to say Opa!"}
{"text":"Don't you just love it when you can text a friend: \"Need your help with something, meet for dinner in an hour.\"   No questions asked, they reply when and where. Boom, that's a friend right there.   Met two friends, we like to call ourselves \"group B\" because we are born winners, at this little unassuming Greek spot. First off, I was like, I need to eat salad. Second, ain't nothing gonna top a Greek salad (because you can get gyro meat on it ... shit, is that defeating the purpose of ordering a salad). Anyway, we showed up about 30 minutes before this place closed and they were so nice to us. No one gave us the look. We ate our salads like true basic bitches, although one of us was a guy, but men can be basic too. Then we discussed our highly top secret matter until it was time to get the hell out.   In conclusion, great spot for covert ops and meat cooked on a spool."}
{"text":"This Sunnyslope area restaurant might be best described as \"don't judge a book by its cover\". The outside is a rather plain brown building, but the magic begins on the inside. This family owned and operated business is warm and welcoming. There is a small bar area for before dinner drinks and lots of regular seating. We ordered a bottle of rose that was okay, not great. However, that ends my complaints. The lentil soup before dinner was extremely flavorful as was flaming saganaki.  I ordered the lamp chops with rice and it was extremely delicious. My husband went for the moussaka and it's flavorful custard didn't disappoint us (yes, I got a few bites). The before dinner salad that came with my lamb chops was also crisp and the house dressing very good. Overall, get ready to shout out \"OOPAH\" a lot, smile, and enjoy the warm family service. Two thumbs up; way up!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been going to this restaurant for years. It was love at first taste and we have since celebrated many special occasions here from birthdays, to Valentine's Day, to our engagement, to our wedding reception, to the announcement of expecting our first baby. The owner, George has been like family to us and the authentic food/service has always been excellent. We love you Greektown! OPA!!!"}
{"text":"Wow!  Dropped in for a quick lunch and discovered a total gem of place. The gyros was excellent, but not the star of the show. Got talked into trying the baklava cheesecake and was blown away. I know what you're thinking... baklava and cheesecake why have I never heard of this before?  Next time I'm in Phoenix I'm coming back no matter what part of town I'm in."}
{"text":"So this is one of those times when I don't know if I should rate this 3 or 4.  The food here is still absolutley, melt in your mouth REAL Greek food.  The spicy lamb and chicken breast stuffed with spinach and feta combo was outstanding.  Accompanied with the red Greek wine, egg lemon soup, Greek salad, hot garlic toast AND hot pita bread.  Amazing.  And affordable.  But here's the rub.  The owner, George, didn't remember us.  That was fine.  But, he was the only server tonight and was totally distracted, all business, not his old friendly, chatty self that always added to the charm of this gem.  We tried to engage him in conversation but he wanted no part of it.  He wasn't busy.  There was only one other table occupied in the whole place.  But maybe that was the problem.  We don't understand why this place isn't packed all the time.  You couldn't ask for more authentic, delectable food and great prices.  Maybe it's the location, maybe it's his attitude.  But it's definitely not the food."}
{"text":"I love Greek food and always try Greek restaurants in my travels. I live in Philadelphia but always try to find an excuse to drive to Phoenix to have Greek food at Greek Town. The outside of the restaurant is uninspiring. The inside of the restaurant is modest, too. But the food is out of this world. Certainly better than most Greek restaurants by far.   The lamb dishes are excellent. The baclava is outstanding. The calamari is the best I've ever had. If you are ever in Phoenix, make time for a meal at this great restaurant. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Try the baklava cheesecake with white chocolate cream. A perfect dessert to finish off a perfect meal. This was our first time and we will definitely be back. Excellent in every way."}
{"text":"Our meals were outstanding, with large portions of extremely tasty Greek food.  I was kind of overwhelmed by George, the owner, at first, but that didn't stop me from enjoying my meal.  The food was wonderful, and by the end of the meal, I really did like talking to George, even if he did insist on calling me and my partner \"girls.\"  The good news is that once you're there, you're a regular.  The people at the table next to us grew up going to the owner's former restaurant on Thomas, and were now bringing their children to eat.   This overt friendliness might be difficult for shy patrons, but try it.  You might just enjoy yourself."}
{"text":"Greektown is the place to be! With a wonderful atmosphere & the owner/waiter/entertainer being A GOOD TIME FRIEND!! First please have the goats milk cheese FLAMED! kalamari is something that must be experienced as it cannot be explained. Everyone Greektown is FLAVORTOWN times 10!!! Oh by the way- the baklava white chocolate cheesecake ... well buckle up and get ready for flavor take off"}
{"text":"Really good food. The waiter (possibly the owner?) made several excellent suggestions for authentic Greek food. Loved all of it! Lots of apparently regular customers which means it has to be good, right?."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the owner was so friendly.  A little strong on the upsell but very nice. Greek music in background but not too loud. Delicious tszatziki- not sure I spelled it right. With warm pita bread and garlic bread.   My chicken pita had loads of chicken, grilled onions, mushrooms and green peppers.   Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I love Greektown and have been going there for a few years now since moving to CenPho. Food is always fresh and delicious, not to mention the owner who is quite a character."}
{"text":"Our group of six arrived with high hopes based on previous yelp reviews. Yes, the menus were tossed onto the table. That was not an issue and was expected. Also, George was in good humor and we enjoyed his wit.  The non-lamb dishes were pretty good. No complaints. However both lamb dishes had the same issues: 1. small meal 2. more bone than meat 3. tough meat 4. a more or less empty plate.  My plate was lamb served over a very small amount of rice with gravy. It had one bone cut to the same shape as the meat. Vivien's plate was lamb served with gravy. It had two bones cut to the same size as the meat."}
{"text":"My wife and I came for lunch today.  We arrived about 1:00 because with so many great reviews and so many reviewers, I thought it might even still be full.  We arrived and the place was deserted....just us two.   The waiter asked how many although he could plainly see how many and took us to a table where he threw the menus down on the table and left.  His attitude never got better and he reminded me of an escapee from some low class gut bomb restaurant.  He took our order.  My wife had calamares and I had dolomares.  I must say that both (we sampled from each other) were excellent.  Portions were a bit small.  The salad was just iceberg lettuce with a small bit of feta sprinkled on it.  No tomatoes or any of the things you'd expect on a green salad.  As I said the dolomares and calamares were very good.  No complains there.  The waiter was as personable as a rattlesnake and when we finished our meal he took all the silver and splashed it down on the plate in front of us and then took the dishes and left. The food was good.  The service was bad in negative numbers.  I think I know why no one else was there.  I know we won't be back.  Thats a shame  because the food was really quite good."}
{"text":"WOW!!  Best Greek food I have had in the Valley.  Love the baklava - cheese cake dessert.  The owners were very welcoming and friendly.  Very nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Awesome food and friendly staff! I have spent some good time in Greece, and this place is the real deal!"}
{"text":"I'm a Greek boy from Chicago. Greektown does a terrific job. Outside of my mom's and yiayia's, I don't order Pastitsio in restaurants. Just doesn't come close to what I grew up with. George's ROCKS! Last night I couldn't decide between the Pastitsio and the Lamb Capama, a wine and tomato sauce braised lamb shank. George just brought me out a half order of both. This part comes from my wife, ( I concur) best calamari ever. These folks do a terrific job, soup and salad come with all the dinners as well as pita and garlic breads. Get some saganaki, yell Opah with George as he lights the brandy on your cheese dish, maybe cap off your meal with a good quality ouzo, and leave stuffed and happy. His baklava gives my sister Pam's a run for her money too."}
{"text":"Loved our food. Loved the service and story telling. George is wonderful. Our next time to Phoenix our e  I'll try to get back her.   Loved the baklava cheesecake! Delicious.   Original gyro - delicious. Lamb very good.   We celebrated our daughters birthday and she had a great time.   Thank you for making it special!!!"}
{"text":"A few friends are regulars here and can't stop talking about this place so my wife and I joined them last Saturday night at about 7pm.  It was pretty dead and we had our choice of table.  The decor is pretty interesting but is pretty typical of a Greek place.  *Pitas = Wow.  Excellent.  No idea if they are homemade though but they come fresh and warm.  They will also give you as much as you want on the house. *Saganaki Flambeau = Flaming Cheese = I love food/drinks that are on fire.  This dish was pretty good and just like at other Greek places. *Fried Calamari = Pretty good.  There was some kind of sauce (butter and lemon?) on it that I'm not so sure about but it was pretty good. *Soup = All meals come with this.  It is pretty good.  It is some type of lemon chicken soup. *Salad = All meals also come with this.  It is a small and standard Greek salad.  It was ok. *Dimitri's Leg = tender and tasty.  Didn't really taste like lamb though.  I could have sworn it was brisket.  Comes with a little bit of veggies and potatoes.   Overall I thought the food was just good.  Most of the dinner menu looks to be higher end Greek fare (I think) with the owner's special twist, so next time I think I'm going to go with some Greek classics such as a gyro, mousaka, etc. so I can get a true feel of this place.  The real star of this place is the owner/waiter/server, George.  This guy is a real character and I think is on crack.  You'll know what I'm talking about when you see him.  Anyway, he is a real nice guy, is very talkative, has some pretty good stories and you can tell he really loves his restaurant.  He even gave us a drink on the house at the end of our meal."}
{"text":"This place, is without a question, one of my favorite places to go in the city.  Rarely my boyfriend and I get to go to lunch together and we don't even question where we are going anymore, its Greektown.  George, the owner, is here 7 days a week.  I know some other reviewers have taken some issue with him, but he is a genuine, hard working guy who just wants to make his customers happy!    Dont judge the book by its cover.  The surroundings are weird, but once you get inside you forget about the area and enjoy the nice decor and quiet, pleasant atmosphere.  The first time we went, we tried to order some random appetizer, and George insisted we get the Calamari.  I thought this was weird for someone to do, but he was right.  It was not only amazing, but to this day the best calamari I have ever had.  So fresh, we lick up every bite with the pita and garlic bread (and I am usually one to try and not eat everything in a meal)  I almost always have the Greek Salad with Gyro meat.  The veggies are fresh and delicious.  I always leave happy not only enjoying the taste, but seeing someone work so hard and genuinely care about their business and take a really active part in it.  If you can get up here, it is absolutely worth it."}
{"text":"Lived in Phoenix my whole life and I make a point of trying new restaurants any chance I get. This was my first experience with Greek food. Holy crap, I am addicted. The spanakopites are to die for. George is so cool and friendly, really makes the experience that much more intimate and memorable. I always get lamb any chance I get now because of here. This is absolutely one of the best places in Phoenix to dine. If you have people visiting, this is one of the gems that proves the city has more to offer than pretty scenery. If you've never been, you're missing out."}
{"text":"What a great place. It's like having dinner at George's house.  Try the spanokopita...delicious...oohpa!!For mains try the lamb chops (George will ask you if you want it bloody or black (try it medium. .. superb). The shrimp Turkolimano is amazing shrimp stuffed with feta cheese and spicy tomatoes...yumm. everything comes with wonderful Bread, soup (a lovely chicken lemon rice soup, and the best Greek said in town.  Prices are amazing inexpensive.  Save room for one of Georges homemade desserts.  Sourly best Greek restaurant in Phoenix"}
{"text":"We were actually on our way to a different restaurant, when my wife saw this little hideaway on the east side of 7th street. She coyly suggested that we should give it a try, and that's all that was required for me to make a quick U-turn in busy traffic.  We had no reservations, and didn't know what to expect. But, it was to be a new experience and we have always up for the challenge of discovering new places to dine.  The moment we walked in, we heard the word \"Opa\" yelled out, followed by everyone clapping.   That's a good sign, right?   Then the owner noticed us, greeted us with a big smile, and has us sit down at the bar for a few moments so that someone could get a table ready for us.   He also took our drink order, and promptly got those for us.   Note that barely a minute has passed and we are already being taken care of, in spite of the fact that the place was packed.   This was definitely looking up already. Festive, quaint, friendly, and prompt.   These are often good introductory signs for a restaurant.  Shortly thereafter, he informed us that our seats were ready, and I grabbed my wife's water and diet coke so that she doesn't have to carry it herself.   The owner took notice and complimented me on being a such a gentleman to the Nth degree. (When have I ever been NOT a gentleman to her? LOL)  We were presented with the menu by one of the servers, and the evening's specials were explained to us. Our server took a few moments to also answer our questions about the restaurant since we were befuddled that we never took notice of it before. And we have driven past this place countless of times.  For the appetizer, we ordered the Spanakopites. This was comprised freshly baked Filo Dough that were stuffed with Spinach, Feta Cheese, and Onions. This particular appetizer was both warm, amazingly flaky and flavorful! It didn't take long before it was consumed in its entirety.  For the main course, I had the Baked Salmon with steamed vegetables. My wife had the Pateetso, which a Greek version of Lasagna.   My Salmon was very well seasoned and quite delectable. My wife commented that her Lasagna was a wonderful combination of cheese, meat, and layered lasagna noodles. Every aspect of the lasagna, from its outer layer to its inner contents, were distinctly flavorful.  Amidst our enjoyment of the amazing dishes that were presented to us, we also enjoyed the occasional revelry by the guests and the owner. And just when I had commented to my wife that the festivities brought back memories of restaurant that I had eaten at on the Isle of Burano by Venice, less the smashing of plates; we then hear the owner smashing some plates on the other side of the restaurant and everyone yelling - OPA!  We were so very glad that we decided to venture out and discover this gem of a restaurant this particular evening."}
{"text":"Greektown is wonderful, authentic  Greek food.  George the owner is charming and funny to talk with and whenever we are in Phoenix, my husband and I love  to eat here.  We have spent a lot of time in Greece and find the food to be very authentic,  you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Liked the gyro, didn't like the calamari. Which is a shame because I love calamari. But I will be back to try the rest of the menu bc it's so close to me."}
{"text":"Wow! What a place!  From the moment we walked in the exceptional service started.  It's a family run place that really care about their patrons.  We were in Phoenix to take our daughter to college and this was our first dining experience in town. Food was fantastic and we had a blast!  We will definitely make this a Phoenix staple when we visit."}
{"text":"Terrible service. It Friday night and the server is the bartender, host, to go person, and cashier. I waited 25 minutes to cash out after I had given a credit card to the server after I got my good. By the time I got home (5 min away) everything was cold and less than appetizing. For the price, I'll stick Gyro house."}
{"text":"Best Greek food in Phoenix, hands down. The food is great, atmosphere is awesome and service is amazing. Can't go wrong with Greektown."}
{"text":"Wow just amazing! We went in last night for my husbands birthday. We wanted to try something different and found this place on Yelp. It does not disappoint! The outside looks a bit rough but once you get inside it is very relaxed. The owner George served us and it was outstanding his suggestions were on point! The kalamari yes it's with a k is so good I could eat it every day! The gyros were delicious the pasta was delicious the bread was amazing! We will be back Greek town is now one of our favorites!"}
{"text":"Wanted an impromptu fun dinner with my wife and this was great!  The moment we walked in, treated like family. Fun yet private. Delicious food. We are coming back and bringing our friends. Opa!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Greektown after looking for something new as we just moved near the neighborhood from across town. George was awesome, although it seems like he shoots Redbull in his veins (does he ever slow down??) at the start of his day! If you can't make up your mind he'll help make it up for you. I couldn't decide between Souzoukakia and Titans Tortellini and he suggested something I hadn't even considered, the Macaronia Me Keemah as he said \"The Greeks make the best pasta\" and I would have to agree it was wonderful. The meat sauce was so flavorful. It was sweet but just enough spice. My wife got Dolmades and loved it. George suggested I try the Greek beers and I am more of a microbrew guy but for lagers they weren't aren't too bad. We will go back for sure. Quite often if I had my way! The food was awesome, everyone was so nice, the place is inviting and cozy. Even the chairs are pretty comfy after all that food! My new favorite Greek place in town!"}
{"text":"From the moment you enter, George will make you feel like family.  We were in the mood for lamb, so off to Greektown we went.  Come hungry as your meal will include soup (not to be missed) and salad.  Highly recommend the calamari, prepared very different but so yummy.  Service was attentive and at times hilarious, and he talks to you like your family.  He broke a plate by yelling OPA and that was a highlight.  Things were lit on fire, desert was amazing - they only have 1 desert...so you know it has to be good.  Oh and greek wine, if you haven't tried, is yummy, even if you prefer white....try it."}
{"text":"We have been going to Greektown for over 30 years and have eaten Greek food all over the world and this is the best we have ever had. The dolmades are amazing. Gyros are incredible and the gyro salad is a favorite. No matter what you order you will be happy. Quality is wonderful and quantity is generous."}
{"text":"I loved the appetizer (calamari and pita bread with cheese dip), The dessert (cheesecake baklava) was great. What I ordered for entree was mediocre. I also ordered some baklava to take home. They were too sweet and had bitter taste as well. Too much honey which made the crust soft. The owner in my opinion was too pushy and talked too much. His jokes were not even funny! My advice to George: \"Please talk less.\""}
{"text":"This place has AMAZING food! You want authentic Greek food then come here! The atmosphere was great also! The outside doesn't look like much, but as soon as you step inside, it feels like a little Greek restaurant! George is also AMAZING! He's personable so he doesn't make you feel like you are just another customer, but a part of the family! If you love Baklava then I definitely recommend theirs! It was the best I have ever had! I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Me and my spouse live in the neighborhood and always drove by. Tonight we decided to stop and have dinner. MAN oh MAN we were not disappointed ONE bit. The garlic pita bread basket goes great with the lemon egg drop soup. I ordered the classic gyro platter and he got the shrimp George. Both were AWESOME and great size portions. Then we got baklava and ice cream,all I can say is AMAZEBALLS. I HIGHLY recommend this place for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"We have been enjoying this place for a few years now, and have never been disappointed.  The food is great and the owner is skilled at making you feel like family.  Support local businesses here in the valley or all that will be left are the bland and boring chains."}
{"text":"Coming in here it was interesting. We came here for a quick meal, and what we got was a little different as far as service. The main server and I believe the owner was very hands on with customers, which to me was a different experience. I felt as the decor didn't really match the customer service, because the server was very hands on. It reminded me of a pizza shop in NY or Italian type of family atmosphere. There's nothing wrong with that, but when I'm going in there to just eat and then get up and go, the server got involved and I guess if you're not used to it or if you're an introvert this place isn't probably where you want to go.  Now, the food was great. I got a Gyro, and of course that's something default, but then again it was a lunch and it was a bit of a drive back. I also ordered a salad, and I could have gotten a salad with the Gyro but the server persuaded me to get both, a salad and some fries. In the end though, we were pretty much in and out and the food came quickly. I definitely recommend this place if you're in the mood for greek food."}
{"text":"I have eaten many Greek meals, all over the country, but Greektown in north Phoenix is one of the best I have had.  I have had a bit better in Greektown Chicago, but not very much better.  I think the highlights of my recent meal in north Phoenix were the Avgolemono (Greek Lemon Chicken Soup) and the Kalimari (octopus) sauteed in garlic (lots of it), butter, and olive oil.  The soup was really really good and the kalimari was unlike anything I have eaten before and was outstanding.  Prices were very reasonable.    Now, as to some critical comments about the personality of the owner (George), I mean COME ON!!  People, get over yourselves.  George is interesting, opinionated, knowledgeable in a lot of areas, blunt and forthright, and does not suffer fools gladly.  My kinda guy.  If you do not like that, then maybe you should move to someplace like LA or San Francisco where obsequious behavior (look it up) is acceptable and expected."}
{"text":"This place was just like described. I can say that the owner could be offensive to you if you chose to take him that way. He's very outspoken and enthusiastic. I liked him, but I can see that some people wouldn't. Anyway, the only reason why I didn't give 5 stars is because when we first walked in we just stood there. No one greeted us, a waitress walked by, made eye contact with me and didn't say anything. She could've at least acknowledged that I was standing there and said someone would be right with us. Anyway, we finally got seated and ordered. We had the calamari appetizer. I hate seafood, but this was really good. It was fresh calamari sauteed in garlic, lemon, and olive oil. Very fresh tasting and didn't taste fishy at all. It came with a side of homemade marinara sauce. The sauce was AMAZING. I will be going back to try the pasta since the sauce was THAT great. We then ordered two classic gyros (only $7 each). I've never had one before, so this was interesting. It was huge, lots of lamb meat, perfectly cooked. It wasn't greasy or anything like others have said gyros can be. It came with a big side of greek salad. Didn't care for the sauce that came with the gyro, so I asked for more of the delicious marinara and dipped my gyro in that. Overall nice dining experience. Place was very clean and decorated with greek things and played greek music. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"The guy who owns this place is a one man band and very  proud of his restaurant. Service is excellent.  Calamari, wine, nice specials. Good drinks. He'll rev it up! Really fun place to take a group. Opah!"}
{"text":"The food was tasty, for sure.  The seating was comfortable.  The service, however, left a lot to be desired.  Our waiter, who I believe was the owner, was far to overbearing and was borderline offensive.  Maybe I offended him by asking for hummus, but surely he's used to us dumb Americans not knowing the difference between Greek and Mediterranean.  Anyway, he proceeded to make a comparison of the word \"hummus\" to the word \"homos\" in an explanation of why he didn't serve it.  And then he said \"homos - okay, that's a little greek,\" and shrugged.  Whether it was a light hearted joke or a slam doesn't matter to me, because he doesn't know me well enough to joke with me like that.  He made us uncomfortable from his first greeting and we won't be going back."}
{"text":"I love trying new places, it was our Girl's dinner night,great pick! The place is really cozy and the owner Gregory was our server! He spoke about his Mom which many of the recipes were hers and everything her recommend was spectacular. We had the calamari an stuffed mushrooms for an appetizer, awsome! Then we proceeded to have the trio to taste a little bit of every. They made us feel like we were part of the family. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Good place, very nice family running the restaurant. They will talk to you and are super friendly. The food, not my favorite. We had a few dishes in a group of five and we all thought the food was just ok, nothing special worth going out of your way for."}
{"text":"The boyfriend and I couldn't decide what to eat so we just searched for the nearest Greek food Restaraunt we could find; so glad we were nearby Greektown! George was a delight and made the experience more personal than any wait staff had ever provided to me before! He was quick witted and filled with fun trivia and conversation!  The food was delicious and we now have to waddle out of the Restaraunt because we were STUFFED but couldn't eat enough of the food! I had the Greek Gyro Platter and the Flaming Cheese  (don't forget to yell at Opa when he sets it on fire)! There was so much food and the atmosphere was cozy but upbeat!   Stop by and see George and enjoy his amazing food and energy, you won't regret it. DON'T SKIP THE DESSERT!"}
{"text":"Wow. Great dining experience. Food was fresh and delicious. Moussaka outstanding. Top that off with great service from George the owner. He went above and beyond. Called 30 min before lunchtime ended and he graciously served just the two of us with five star service.   If we lived in Phoenix we'd come here often."}
{"text":"I first discovered this place when it was on 7th street and Glendale  George always has the kindest of things to say to me and his family is wonderful. I have told people again and again about Greektown and the food takes me back to Greektown in Michigan. OPA!"}
{"text":"Greektown is not too far from my house & we'd been meaning to head over.  So, when my BF and I were wanting something 'different' than our norm, he suggested Greektown and off we went.  We pulled into a pretty deserted parking lot at 5:30 on a Tuesday and I was a little nervous.  Past Yelpers had given 4 stars, so in we went.  We were greeted by a man sitting at the bar - I am assuming the owner.  There was only 1 other occupied booth and he offered us our choice of where to sit.  We opted for a table and he handed us menus and said he'd be right back.  Looks to me like he does a lot of the work himself & you can tell he's proud of his food.  Just ask, he'll tell you, LOL... \"go figure\". (stop in and you'll laugh at my 'go figure' reference).  I'd decided on an appetizer of taramosalata.  He said, \"No\".  I said, please, and he again denied me.  He detailed how he couldn't get the fresh fish eggs that he normally used, and the other available options weren't up to his standards, so he wouldn't be serving that this week.  He went on to suggest the calamari and boasted it was the best in town.  It did NOT disappoint.  He said it wasn't fried, but it was crispy.  It was tender and flavorful.  Will order this again for sure.  On to dinner.  I couldn't decide between 2 shrimp dishes, so he offered to give me 1/2 and 1/2 so that I could try them both.  I wound up with Shrimp Grigori and Shrimp Trukolimano - both were fantastic.  BF ordered Angus the Greek (mmmm steak).   We had a cup of creamy, but light chicken soup with rice and lemon.  It had a little kick of spice and I promptly declared that to be the soup I want next time I am sick.  My shrimp was perfectly cooked and BF's steak was also cooked as ordered, bloody as hell.  DELICIOUS.    Along the way, our host suggested beers by asking if we like light or dark or somewhere in between. He was attentive, but not annoying, and FUNNY.  He's loud and jokes and makes you feel like you've been his customer for years.  As we were leaving, he thanked us for coming and told us our orders were fun.  Oh, I'll also say that the price seemed great.  We each had 2 beers, we split the calamari and we got soup & salad included in the meals - steak and shrimp - all for $65!    My only regret is not ordering the baklava cheesecake.  Next time I'll save room."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants we have ever been to. The best Greek food we've ever had. George is awesome, knowledgable and just a great host. We will always visit this place when in Arizona.  We had a bit of everything it's all good and fresh."}
{"text":"My first time at Greek Town and I was made to feel at home and welcome. George is jovial and offered us suggestions. I had the Pasteetso and found it very tasty. I also had some Saganaki Flambeau appetizer and enjoyed it very much. Don't be put off by the outside appearance of the building, since it is not flashy. But instead stop and come inside for a great eating experience."}
{"text":"Lunch at Greektown is always a pleasure. George - the owner and chef - does a great job making you feel like family. The food is always flavorful. The gyros are always excellent as is everything else they make."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Service was energetic and welcoming. If I lived here it would be a regular stop. Get the calamari  (nice to have a different type sauce) and dessert was great!"}
{"text":"What is the name of every fourth male born in Greece? George!  George, who I believe is the owner, took care of us over lunch the other day... When we asked his name, he responded with the trivia question above!  He is quite the character.  We started with a dip sampler platter that had 4 dips:  Tsatziki, TaramoSalata, MelitsanoSalata, and one more... but it wasn't hummus.  They don't serve hummus at Greektown.  The dips were accompanied by perfectly warmed pita bread.  I could've made a meal out of the pita and TaramosSalata, but I had a Greek Salad as well.  It was the perfect lunch portion.  A tad bit on the overdressed, garlicky side, but luckily I wasn't planning on kissing anyone that afternoon.  I don't live near Greektown, but if I'm ever in that hood again, I wouldn't hesitate to return!"}
{"text":"Great food and even better atmosphere! Owner and staff are so hospitable, we loved the food and them!! Highly recommend, doesn't look like too much from the outside but don't let it fool you the food is fantastic"}
{"text":"Amazing place! I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone seeking top notch Greek food. George the owner is anazing with the customers, the service is fast, and the food is delicious. I highly recommend the gyro. The meat is very tender, flavorful and they load it on. The tatziki is very fresh, and has small chunks of cucumber throughout it. The fries are perfectly crisp and seasoned with herbs. Also, the baklava cheesecake is the best cheesecake I've ever had. The cheesecake is pleasantly tangy which is well balance by the nuts and honey in the baklava. It also comes with a generous portion of fresh whipped cream topped with cinnamon and a honey drizzle."}
{"text":"Family owned, food very fresh, best gyro in town. Their calamari is also a lazing, as is the baklava cheesecake. YUM!!  Love when somebody in the restaurant orders whatever dish they make that comes out on fire and the owner yells \"OPA!!!\" Makes me laugh :) The owner is a character and keeps the place lively. Fun times, tasty food. They will also make relatively whatever you want off the menu I've found- just ask."}
{"text":"Once again from the time we walked George made us feel like at home! The ouzo was a great start to the night, followed with the calamari, lamb chops, and the baklava cheesesteak to go! Thanks and we will be back my friend!  Aka \"New York \""}
{"text":"My new favorite Greek place in town.  First let me start by saying, this is a perfect hole in the wall. It's in a small quaint building, I went around dinner time and it was not busy. We walked in and were greeted by happy, smiling staff. Which is always a positive.   As I looked around, it had a very fancy but laid back feel. Candles were lit, they had nice table-clothes, it was super pretty.   There was a man walking around checking up on each table and cracking jokes (I assume the owner), who added character to the restaurant. It felt very family friendly.   The food was amazing. It had a variety of choices and very good prices considering the quality of the food.   I will be returning and recommending to every Greek lover!"}
{"text":"we got two classic gyros (one with fries; one with side salad). george (owner) was so friendly and helpful. he recommended we cap off our meal with baklava on top of a cheesecake with whipped cream -- all homemade. man, it did not disappoint. we were sufficiently fat and happy from the gyros, and then found ourselves fighting over the last bites of the dessert. (i won.) no better way to finish a meal if you ask me."}
{"text":"Honestly, best place in the valley for the traditional greek food and fare.  The owner makes the joint that much more authentic... If you fancy some greek food and are thinking about headin over the MBFG (my big fat greek) STOP!!!!!!! it is not what you really want.  Food - Spirits/beer/wine should come from people who know the language, live the life and love the culture of greece.  Greektown is this place... Best greek salad and the gyro meat is killer.  And, as Rnady G stated... it is the diamond.. The diamond in the center of town that you need to experience and you will come back."}
{"text":"The owner is a wonderful guy, quite a character with good jokes. Very laid back and very good food.  Definitely a must go to place. Good alcohol too"}
{"text":"Decided to give this neighborhood spot a try after reading some glowing reviews. Agree that the Calamari and Baklava Cheesecake were outstanding. Also, very impressive and reasonably priced wines. Atmosphere would have been better if they had closed the blinds offering the view of the neon \"Jiffy Lube\" but the booths are cozy and comfortable (far better than the tables). Service started off good though wishing our waiter had on a long sleeve collared shirt vs the logo t-shirt.  He made recommendations for beverages and wine and offered some good menu suggestions then disappeared for the balance of the evening.  Thank goodness for the lovely woman who cleared out plates, took our dessert order and made us feel welcome.  Wish I had gotten her name. The owner?  Other than asking us to \"like their Facebook Page\" on our way out the door barely welcomed or noticed us...too busy fawning over his regular guests to welcome new ones I suppose. Back to the food... Bread basket was outstanding! Greek Salad arrived with our meals (not before hand) and looked like a tired left over banquet salad...just tired looking and unimpressive. Same with he lentil soup starter (included w/ the meal)...honestly, looked like something right out of a can. The Gyros Platter...what is up w/ dumping French Fries on top?!?!  UGH The Shrimp was nicely done and all good arrived steaming hot!  A bonus. We would give this another try with the hope of better service, a genuine/warm welcome, and select different entree."}
{"text":"This is a tough place to review. I could give it anywhere from 1 to 5 stars depending on what I want to emphasize. Ultimately I'm choosing to give it 2 stars, for great food amid a experience marred beyond repair by the crazy owner.  By \"crazy\" I mean shouting, smashing plates, barking orders at customers as they walk through the door.... In the first few minutes I was 50/50 on turning around and walking out but decided to interpret the man's actions as \"Friendly guy with different cultural understanding of boundaries\" rather than \"Scary heroin addict who's barely holding it together right now.\" Multiples times throughout the evening we both wondered if we'd made the right choice. At a booth near us the family's two kids spent most of their visit hiding under the table in fear.  The fatal blow against us wanting to return came toward the end of our meal, when we were considering whether to stay for dessert. We'd managed to find the lighter side of all the craziness up until that point. But then the owner pulled up a seat at our table and launched into a diatribe about the country my wife's ancestors come from. As she started to school him on how ignorant and offensive the things he just said were, he backtracked and insisted he \"couldn't be racist\" because he \"lived in [that country]\" for a time himself. His story rang false and did not excuse what he said. We nope'd out of there right away."}
{"text":"The food was excellent. The owner George was very out going and energetic. The saganaki and kalmari was awesome. Highly recommend it. Next time I'm in town I will stop here again."}
{"text":"This is by far some of the best Greek food I've ever eaten. I'm Greek and I have been to Greece many times, and the food here at Greektown is as good or better than anything I've ever had.   The owner is great! He makes you feel like you're in his own home. You can tell by the food and service that this is his home."}
{"text":"Had to a long wait for our table & service is a bit slow but we weren't in a hurry. Once they seat you & take your order the service flows nicely. This is a family restaurant and they are all very friendly- as if to welcome us in their home and share their culture with us. Price and portion of food are reasonable. The kids loved it. We tried the Saganaki Flambeau, which is a great way to start off. They have you say \"opa\" before you can eat it & the while restaurant will say it with you. One kiddo had the Tortillini with meat sauce & the other a Charbroiled Chicken Ceasar's Salad. My husband had a cheese lasagna and I had the chicken gyro. All of it very delicious. They only have 3 desserts but I love baclava so the desert menu hit high marks. They only have Lager beer, which I'm more of the Ale or mild beers but boy was their beer refresh in and smooth - I forgot the name of it (it starts with an \"A\"). They also have a house wine for $4 a glass. George made the kids a blue sprite drink he calls, Windex. This was my first time eating here but definitely not the last. We found this place when watching \"Check Please\" which is great to watch - it gives you ideas of yummy places to eat, all over Arizona. It's also a great way to support the local, small, family owned businesses. We watch it religiously & visit the places they air on their show. Whoever picked this restaurant did a great job."}
{"text":"I'm a chef.  My standard for dining out is that the food must be better than I can prepare myself. Greektown meets that standard with ease.  The Mousaka is the best on the planet. I recently brought a Greek colleague to Greektown and after the first bite of Mousaka she said, \"OMG this is better than Dad's!\" The fried calimari rings are the best I've ever had.  George, the owner, is full of life and enthusiasm and banter.  Half the fun of going to Greektown is interacting with George.  This place is my go-to spot for business lunch meetings in the central corridor. The booths are large and offer privacy, and the place is quiet enough for conversation.  And Greektown serves the best Greek food in the valley.  I don't go anywhere else."}
{"text":"The food was excellent. George was great. My father was impressed (he's hard to please)."}
{"text":"One of the best gyros I can recall having.  George the owner is super friendly and makes sure your experience in enjoyable.  Prices are very reasonable!  Looking forward to coming back soon!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants. Great, authentic Greek food. Serving staff that make you feel like family."}
{"text":"Excellent food, service, dessert, ect... I am so happy we discovered this place! The owner was really personable and we enjoyed talking with him. I would highly recommend giving this place a try! I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I'll just wrap up the service as \"odd\" - not really bad, and George was very nice, but also sort of spotty and he'll only be chatty to certain tables and not to others for whatever reason. I don't have any major complaint with service though.  I ordered the veal plate, which was OK, but quite expensive for just two seriously thin slices of veal. More importantly though, the veal was not cooked great; it was tough and the fat wasn't broken down at all. Veal needs to be cooked carefully, and when it is, it is amazing. But this just wasn't. The sauce and veggies on the plate were perfect, and wonderfully homely & greek! And as others have mentioned, the baklava cheesecake with the white chocolate mousse..oh man - what an amazing desert. I will probably come back just for this.  All in all I don't think it's a bad place, and I'll probably be back at some point - I'll just stick to the cheaper plates as the over $20 plates just aren't worth it IMO."}
{"text":"Pros-service is great owner is friendly and funny and so is son...we were given free shots even...not expensive Cons-some of the food is hit or miss...the pita bread, greek salad, and flaming cheese was delicious...greek beer mythos is good, my main dish of baby clams and pasta looked bleh/gray and tasted bleh too and not that fresh   Some people complain about decor, I mean its a family-run restaurant so I wasn't expecting it to be all crazy modern and I think it's fine because not as expensive as places like that. At night it has a low lit ambiance that's romantic combined with the Greek decor. Service can be a little slow b/c they don't have many ppl working there, but they are attentive. I'm willing to give this place another shot b/c the service was very personable, fair-priced, and I like small restaurants that make their own food, but I won't be getting sea food probably again."}
{"text":"Coming to Greektown is always an experience. Straight from the first time we came in and everytime since, its always part spectacle and part amazing food. The place is family run, and the wife is clearly one of the main cooks. She's very quiet and soft spoken compared to her husband and son. The food is some of the most authentic Greek that I have ever tasted, and the family has no issues giving suggestions.   When you are seated, you're served an order of mixed breads which all of them are very yummy, and I would suggest not filling up on them since their meal portions are HUGE. They also offer a wide selection of both imported and domestic beers, liquors, and wines; many of which are actually from Greece. Though I'll warn you against the Ouzo which is a jager/absinthe like spirit served in a shot that can be quite unpleasant for the faint of heart. The Greek lagers on the other hand are quite light and refreshing and pair well with whatever you order.  I go for their gyros, which are by far the hugest and most tasty in town. My boyfriend is addicted to their dolmades, which unlike many dolmades you'll find at other restaurants, are full of meat. And trust me, you may not think you'll be full off just an order of stuffed grape leaves but somehow these things manage to be really filling. Especially if you order the meal, which comes with a soup of the day and a salad, both of which have always been delicious. Though my one gripe is that the olives aren't pitted, so watch out. And the dolmades themselves, apart from being stuffed with meat, are also served in a delicious and delicate sauce that pairs perfectly with the dish.  The place is family run and the owner makes it a point to sit and chat with each table, often times pulling up a chair alongside the table and making sure every meal was exactly to the customers' liking. The place is great for large groups and parties though that does mean it can get pretty loud. Its not uncommon to hear the whole place yell out an \"opah!\" if anything breaks. It does close down in the afternoon for a few hours before the dinner rush so beware what time you're thinking of trying this place out, but never worry about finding parking as their lot is quite spacious.  And finally, do yourself a favor and get the baklava cheesecake, which is a wonder of engineering apart from being incredibly delicious. If you dont have space in your stomach after gorging on their amazing food, take it to go, and trust me, you will thank me."}
{"text":"Baklava Cheesecake?  Need I say more here?  It was amazing!! George was awesome and accommodating.  I really loved my Gyro and enjoyed having lunch here.  I will be back to eat here whenever I am back in town!"}
{"text":"This is the best food in the whole wide world! George is an extraordinary host and welcomes everyone like family. Always a fabulous experience with the most delicious food to ever grace your tastebuds! My favorite restaurant, hands down!"}
{"text":"I chose Greektown to meet a woman for a first date because I had been there for lunch a few times many years ago and remembered that the food was good and atmosphere was authentic, with murals of scenes from Greece painted on the walls and pleasant.  George, the owner and waiter, is very gregarious and friendly and I asked him if they made kabobs there and he said sometimes they have beef or lamb (which I don't like anyway) but they could only make chicken kabobs so my date and I both decided to order the salmon special of the day.  I also took his advice and ordered a bottle of Amethystos, a white wine from the city of Drama in northeastern Greece.  He brought us the main course in a timely manner and it was topped with a lemon sauce and herbs, potatoes and carrots and the salmon was delicious!  Not really traditional Greek food but tasty nonetheless.  He also brought us a typical Greek salad which we shared.  George recommended a cheesecake dessert with falafel, topped with caramel and walnuts and served with cream and it was scrumptious and we demolished it eagerly!  An overall satisfying meal and atmosphere, although the party next to us was a little noisy and my only complaint is that I feel I was overcharged for the bottle of wine at $41 but my date and I both enjoyed it and you have to splurge sometimes to make a good first impression and I think I accomplished that!  I would highly recommend this restaurant and will be back again!"}
{"text":"Considerably overpriced. Some of the food was okay but other food was pretty awful. Owner at least has a sense of humor but he and his wait staff were rather cavalier with their customer service, literally tossing menus at people, not coming by to refill drinks even once.  I really got the impression that they could give the least bit of a shit and couldn't help but feeling like I was sitting in on an episode of Kitchen Nightmares."}
{"text":"The Kalamari is the best in the city of not the Southwest. Saganaki, although a little different than what I'm used to in Tarpon Springs, is delightful and delicious. Souvlakee was scrumptious as was the traditional lamb gyro. George is a card, ask to meet him. We were there when the 'family' was there and got to meet two generations of chefs. I highly recommend this place, perhaps you'll see me there!"}
{"text":"I used to work right next door to this restaurant, and I'm not a big fan of Greek food. The owner always invited me over to have food for lunch, always offered me free salads to take home for my family and friends to try. This place was great. Very unique for how small it is and the staff is really what made me love it. My wife is always asking me to go get a Greek salad from here now!"}
{"text":"The food is great, George treats you like family, as if he's known every customer for years.  This is a fantastic little restaurant."}
{"text":"I try to make this visit whenever I am in town.   Quality food and great service.   I think the service here is what makes the difference the owner here really makes the experience personal and makes you feel very naturally at home."}
{"text":"You know the phrase \"A Diamond in The Rough\"?  Greektown is that diamond. Nestled in an area where LoLo's would feel right at home, Greektown hardly looks like an amazing restaurant.  However, it is on the inside where the food really shines. The resturant is family owned, with the Mother actually in the kitchen, slaving over traditional dishes such as dolmas, gyros, falafel, and Sweetbreads.  That's right, Sweetbreads. I was warned by the owner when I ordered them, I assume most people do not know that they are the thymus glands of a calf. They were fantastic. Served in a simple tomato sauce, they were cooked to perfection and were warm and filling.   Every meal comes with soup and salad, the soup was a warm lemon soup, it was excellent, I even used the bread to soak up what was left in the bowl. The salad was simple, using feta, kalamatas, and olive oil.  My fiance had the chicken (I forget which ones),but it was some of the most tender and moist chicken ever.  And really, that is the key to this place, the simplicity.  From the throw pillows to the heart-warming and amusing owner, to the fantastic food.  The only thing missing from this place is the ability to toss plates, but then again, when we went, it wasn't super busy.  Opa!"}
{"text":"Best calamari. George has does a pan fried calamari that you have yo try. George is George and the restaurant would just be another restaurant without him. Relax, have a drink and some fun with him.  The food is so good that we over ordered and could have easily made a meal out of the the appetizers. The hot garlic toast AND hot pita bread are the best ever! I kidded George about his chewy pancakes (the pita) and he was delighted. Tried a Greek beer and it was to hoppy for my taste, guess I am just an American beer kind of guy. The food id good enough to bring you back and George is personal enough to keep you coming back."}
{"text":"Fantastic food at a great price. Love the lemon chicken soup complimentary appetizer and house salad. Pasteetsio is my favorite. George the owner is extremely personable."}
{"text":"Friends took me here for my birthday. Authentic Greek food. Small place but cozy. Portions are small but food was delish. Atmosphere was upbeat and friendly. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite geek spot. Calamari is a must for an appetizer . It's a pretty comfortable restaurant and the guy running it can be pretty entertaining . The cheese cake was also really good . They even threw in some complimentary shots. To top it all off the food is very affordable."}
{"text":"I never write reviews but had to for George. The service is the best around and the food matches. Authentic Greek food and every time I come in I want to stop at the appetizers (calamari is his specialty but the mushrooms are my favorite) but keep going because the gyros are my favorite in town! If you're in the area be sure to stop by."}
{"text":"Don't let this place fool you!   Picked up Gyro for lunch.....excellent. George, the owner, was super welcoming, the gyro and salad was delicious and more importantly left me full!   Will definitely be back for dinner sometime."}
{"text":"This is my wife's favorite place to go eat period! My visit was two weeks ago, and I have not had a chance to post. What upset us was a couple of women were sitting right ahead of us. The one was always complaining to the other about the wait. Well, if you want something fast and quick, THIS IS NOT THE PLACE TO GO! This is a place to ENJOY AND RELAX! Well, amazing a BUG came to the lady that was BITCHING! I would east off the floor at Greektown! Being a General Manager in food for over 30 plus years, I KNOW THE TRICKS PEOPLE USE TO GET SOMETHING \"ON THE HOUSE\". This happened and I watched it! Well, George as always went OVERBOARD on stating was sorry and upset he was! This man, not once, not twice, but even went outside to their car to state how sorry he was! DO YOU SEE THIS ANYWHERE ELSE??? George, you were awesome, and went beyond what you needed to do! My wife has Breast Cancer. George put a smile on her face, and MADE HER DAY! We all had Pita's which were cooked with love, and the desert which is pictured IS TO DIE FOR!!! The cheesecake is out of this world! I live a total of  30 miles away, and if gas was over $4.00 again, I WOULD STILL GO HERE!!!! Thank you George, your wife, and your staff for caring! Godspeed my friend and keep up everything you do!!!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, what a wonderful experience!  The food was delicious, the service seriously fun, and make sure to end your meal with baklava cheese cake!!!  You will not be disappointed!  The Virginians!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is 100x better than any restaurant in   GreekTown Chicago!! Highly recommend you eat here.  Authentic and Delicious!"}
{"text":"George is a friendly host that makes all his guests feel welcome! The food is good. The lentil soup is the best soup I've ever eaten!"}
{"text":"Raised in a Greek home I have a high bar for my Greek food. Traveling from out of town, I was excited to have a nice big fat Greek dinner.   First the good... the spanakopita, calamari and lamb shank were very good. The linguine clams was mediocre a best. Overall the food would get 3.5 stars. The bus boys were kind and helpful. In fact I wish they were our waiter...   Now the bad... our waiter aka the owner. I eat out often, and I've never been so berated or patronized by any restaurant service person in my life. He was super aggressive about upselling from the start. He also has a very abrasive personality. When Ild decline his pushes he would get angry, raise his voice and argue without listening to our response. Then held walked off in a huff... repeatedly.   I was with guests and did not want to make a scene so I just ignored his rudeness. But I can tell you, there's something wrong wth this man... he needs to stay away from customers. But I will not be back to find out..."}
{"text":"If your looking for the best Greek food in Arizona this is the place. My girlfriend and I had a taste for Greek and found this place which turned out to be a great find as we're new to the Phoenix area.  The owner George was an amazing host and extremely knowledgeable for what we wanted taste and texture wise. I'm not a big seafood fan but his calamari was amazing. A must try"}
{"text":"Just had the best calamari ever here. Came in to grab a quick to-go order but stayed to eat the calamari, because as George puts it - \"that's like going to a steak house and taking a steak to go...it's just not the same. Eat the calamari here and I'll make your Chicken George to go.\" Can't argue with the man's logic.   So I did...AND he was right! He also is quite good on the guitar with an amazing voice!  Totally devoured the calamari...(lightly pan fried and covered in a lemony sauce. The marinara sauce matched it perfectly, not making it too salty like most places do.) All the while he entertained while cooking and packing up the rest of my dinner. (Which was also amazing!)   This has to be the best dine in experience I've had in a while. Will definitely come back next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"First off, I have to say that the food was pretty good, and if I judged solely on that, Greektown would likely get four stars from me.  Unfortunately, the service (lack thereof?) was not so good.  I rank this place 2.5 stars, but since 3-4 days later we are still talking about the poor service, I rounded down to two instead of up.  We were for a birthday dinner this past weekend, a total of five adults and one infant .  We arrived around 5:30 or so, thinking this would be plenty of time to have the meal, and leave in plenty of time for the child to be home before 'cranky time'.  The first problem was when we had to wait for 5-10 minutes to be seated, even though the restaurant was half full.  If a second person hadn't come up to us, I'm not sure how long it would have taken.  The second problem was that the service was just slow.  Maybe this is normal here, but I've been to other Greek restaurants and the meal has never been this slowly paced.  Another person in our party thought they were understaffed, but I didn't get that impression.  Anyways, after an hour and fifteen minutes, we had only received the apps and just gotten our soups (note:  The hot/fresh pita bread was fantastic!)though one person did not receive a bowl for some reason.  At this point, our youngest dining companion let it be known that it was time to go.  I drew the short straw and headed home.  I was later informed that the service continued to be slow the rest of the time and the meal was not finished for another 45-60 minutes after I left.  I also heard that it took around 10 minutes for the check to be brought out after being requested.  When my meal arrived home, it tasted very good, even though I had to heat it up in the microwave.  Bottom line, I would give Greektown another chance based on the food alone.  However, if you have some time constraint or are with an infant (it was pretty loud in there), you might want to go someplace else.  2.5 stars, rounded down."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what Greektown the other Yelpers were going to but this was for sure a miss.  Good - The pita bread (except for the burned pieces), the taziki Bleh - Everything else.   The decor looks like something that needs to be on Restaurant Impossible for redos.  A little pitcher on our table (perhaps olive oil?) was missing it's handle and chipped on the lip.   The gyros were bleh - the meat was a little slimey - didn't have that crisp edge you get from a carved gyro - the meat slices were super thick too.  Side salad was a warm, dressing-soaked mess.   They were out of straws - and the \"hilarious\" owner George said that was the new style.  (He was just shy of rude the rest of the time).  The spanikopita was hot and looked inviting, but seemed to be filled with a big glop of unseasoned frozen spinach (and no cheese)."}
{"text":"The food was really good here and we liked it.  My husband ordered a trio of Mousska, Dolmades, and Pastitio.  I ordered a regular Gyro.  Both came with salads.  I told the waiter and owner that we had a mobile Entertainment coupon and they said fine.  In fact, the owner never really looked at the coupon to see any terms and conditions.  I just said it said 10% off.  They honored that more so on my word than being picky about the coupon.  They seated us in a booth at the far end of the restaurant away from other people, which is what my husband wanted.  The decor was nice, friendly and clean.  The ambiance was nice and the tables had nice tablecloths and cloth napkins - a place that is nicer than what we normally go to.  The owner was very friendly and energized, gave us personal attention without being overbearing.  The booths were big so my husband and I could snuggle together, but eat without bumping our arms into each other.  We were glad to leave a good tip and glad we made the trip up to north Phx for this restaurant.  The owner is from Manhattan New York.  I never got the chance to ask if he was Greek or not, but the food was really good.  We would come back again.  The restaurant from the outside didn't look too great, but the inside was fine.  If we are in the area again, we'll go eat there again.  Service is really important and though the food was a little pricier than what we normal buy, we'd come here without a coupon just because there is not only good food, but good service with a smile!  We loved that the portions were just right and not super size me large."}
{"text":"I was here with my family celebrating my great-grandma's 101st birthday and I was incredibly impressed with the service and the food. We were treated like family throughout the meal, which was delicious. I had Gaia's Garden, which was a tasty vegetarian dish with potato, zucchini, broccoli, carrots, and pilaf. The baklava cheesecake was pretty epic. My first visit here, but I felt like I'd been going here forever. A very special occasion was made even more special by the wonderful folks at Greektown. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I've been to greek places all up and down the west coast, and this is my favourite for Arizona!  We started with the Saganaki Flambeau, brought to our table by George (the owner, lol). So yummy, spicier than I am used to, but irresistible! The basket of pita and seasoned bread was great. The pita was still warm and fluffy. Its not Stefano's (greek place in Vancouver, BC) fluffy pita bread, but still great.   We both had the chicken souvlaki. One thing I appreciated was that they take the chicken off the kabob before bringing it to you. Its a nice touch that makes dinner easier and less messy. Perfect seasoning, juicy, I literally said, \"Omg I want to have sex with this food\".   I could eat that tsatziki all by itself. It was flat out amazing, the best I have ever had, anywhere, ever. Omg, just thinking about it is making me crave it.   The veggies on the side were not the usual lemon flavoured ones, but these had been cooked in what seemed like cinnamon and nutmeg. It was unexpected and tasty.   We were there pretty late, and the last table there. They changed the music from the greek music to classic rock, we had a great time jamming out at our table as we ate.   Lastly, we talked to George a few minutes, and on our way out he offered me a free shot of Ouzo. We didn't get to have their baklava (which I heard was awesome) because my girlfriend is allergic to walnuts. The ouzo was a perfect finish to the meal, and George is hilarious.   Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"My friend has been telling me about this place for months and I finally got to try it out. I have only tried Greek food once before (My Big Fat Greek Restaurant) and wasn't that impressed with it...until now! I had the Chicken George and it was absolutely amazing!! I will definitely return there again to see what other culinary delights await me :)"}
{"text":"**Closed for vacation 6/26/17 to 7/21/17** Really loved this place when we ate here last year during our volleyball tournament. So sad that they're closed but will definitely visit again the next time we're in town! You will love the delicious, authentic Greek food, the adorable \"Windex\" drinks for the kids, and George's funny, endearing banter!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Greek restaurant and I highly recommend it. I usually get one of the specials of the day and get some Greek wine to go with it. The owner is more than happy to help you select a wine that would compliment your meal. Another nice touch is the throw pillows in the booths."}
{"text":"I remember my first dinner at Greektown was a number of years ago and I loved it.  I have been re-introduced to this fabulous place again and it's become one of my new favorite places.   Besides the food which is the best Greek food in town, George is the reason to be a regular here!  I love walking in and being recognized and greeted by everyone.   I thought I was special, but, then again, he knows everyone that comes to his restaurant!!    My favorite is the soup, which is not even on the menu!! YOU have to know about it!!   But quite honestly, everything I have tasted is fabulous!!   So big 5 STARS to George and thank you for always knowing my name when I walk in the door!!"}
{"text":"George is a great guy and an amazing server. Really impressed with the level of service. You wouldn't expect much from the outside but don't let that stop ya. Our first time there and he made us feel welcome and like family.  THIS IS REAL GREEK FOOD YOU HAVE TO TRY!   Some of the best Greek food I've ever eaten."}
{"text":"The owner was running the show when we had dinner there on a Wednesday evening. Had the Calamari as an appetizer and it was really good. The lemon orzo soup was a nice touch. Wife had the gyro platter which was really good. I had the snapper special and I thought it was a little too salty.  Overall, the food was very good, although service was a bit slow."}
{"text":"Wish we were in the area more, we certainly would go back often. LOVED the food and enjoyed the conversation with the owner."}
{"text":"We got off to a slow start. George seemed to be a bit distracted, and did not provide much information. Basically, if you want soup, you get the soup of the day and that's it. The soup we had was lentil. Frankly, it was just OK. It had rice instead of potatoes, which was a huge disappointment. But that was the last disappointment I had. Even though we came for lunch, I ordered off the dinner menu. This was my birthday lunch, and I wanted lamb. I got the lamp chops. I was somewhat disappointed that there were only four lamb chops. By the time I finished, I was really disappointed that there were only four. Those were some of the best lamb chops I had ever had in my life. Maybe it was a good thing that there were only four, Had there been more, I probably would've eaten them. That would've been a disaster. As it was, I had a room for dessert. George talked us into the cheesecake with baklava on top of it. Oh my. That was so wonderfully delicious. Basically, I have my new go to place for special events. The lamb was not cheap, But for a super treat, this is certainly the place to go.  By the way, my spouse had the gyro salad and was well pleased."}
{"text":"First off, long wait for a table even though there were many empty. They said they had reservations for them but they were never filled the whole time we were there. Atmosphere what fun though, and George had a great personality. They get the whole restaurant(not a huge dining room, very intimate) involved when yelling opa or singing happy birthday. The food is, well some was good, some was bad. The dolmas were amazing, and spanakopita was baked nicely and tasty. The gyro meat was quite flavorful but the onions they put on it was chopped horrible and fell right out. The mousaka and pasteesto were very overcooked and just mush, no texture at all. The vegetables were unseasoned and overcooked as well. Received the snapper in clam sauce and although the flavor was spot on, my dish was microwaved, or as it seemed. The fish had great flavor but again was mush, and came out so hot that you know it didn't come out of a Sauté pan. Our tab was eighty dollars without any alcohol and the dishes were subpar. For that price I expected properly cooked food, on clean plates. Not microwaved fish and dirty rims. I would like to say I would come back and give another try, but we drove out to this side of town just to try it and can't envision myself doing that again. Maybe if I'm in the area. Great service, cute restaurant, disappointing entrees with a hefty price tag."}
{"text":"This place was very noisy with their constant yelling. It took about 35 minutes for the 4 of us to get our food. The food was acceptable but I wouldn't call it exceptional. I think the items were overpriced. The owner was constantly pushing wine. The menu did not list any choices other than water an wine. I ordered a gyro sandwich. The meat was okay but not really tasty. The french fries were in the pita bread and were soggy. I will not return to this place."}
{"text":"This place is solid. I've come in a few different times, but by the 2nd time i came, the owner, George recognized me & went above & beyond to cater to our needs. It was funny because the first time i went with a guy & he paid for everything so i didn't really have to worry about what i got, but the 2nd time i came in was with one of my girl friends & we both were planning to pay seperate & then did i realize the prices...  I wouldn't say its overly expensive because what you get is what you pay for & everything is phenomial, however, being a young college student, i didnt want to lay down 15/20 bucks for dinner, so we decided to leave & George literally came running out after us & wanted to figure out what was wrong. Once he heard about why we were leaving immediately hooked us up with a deal & pretty much charged half price on everything with free desert. It was amazing.  George is awesome. All the employees are really inviting & nice as well. Come here & enjoy the authentic, raw culture of Get em to the Greek! :]"}
{"text":"Everytime I'm in Phoenix, I HAVE to stop at Greektown. The food is always incredible. I mean, all of the food. The wine..I mean you just have to get the wine if you are going Greek. The best part though, is the service. The feeling of the restaurant is very authentic, and it all had a story. The owner, will tell you the stories and have you laughing the entire visit. He is funny, kind, and makes sure you are taken care of. If you want to feel like you are visiting Greece, go to Greektown."}
{"text":"I stopped going to this place quite a while ago, but haven't had the chance to put up a review and explain why.   First and foremost, this place is in decline. I went there for a couple of  years, especially when I worked in the area, and it has gotten more an more vacant with each visit. I didn't understand why, given all the awards they have littering the dinning area, but I have come to realize that no matter how good your food is, poor service will be the end of you every time. Such is the case with Greek Town.   The owner, George, is borderline obnoxious. I don't know if this is a culture thing or what, but he seems to be able to offend just about anyone in your party at some point. Sadly, at the same time, he and his wait staff have no clue about proper service, a fact that appears to be well reflected in other reviews here. I have many, many times, had my drinks run out, ran out of pita/bread for dipping and so on, all the while the restaurant is practically deserted. When you have three servers to support an restaurant that small, and empty, you have no excuse for that kind of abandonment of a table.   Furthermore, George and everyone else in that place seem to be brusk and snobbish. I used to be given a run down of the dinner/lunch specials when I was seated, but more often than not in the last half dozen visits or so, I had to ask what the special was. That wouldn't be so bad, but the response I got was almost an eye-rolling vibe, as if I'd made some horrible offense by asking what the daily special was.   Secondary to the service problem is the food. My earlier visits were flawless, but more recent ones have been replete with problems. I get gyros delivered with empty bowls of dressing on the plate. Empty bowls on the plate, how does that get past the person checking the food? How does it get past the server? The preparer? Nobody catches this, really? And before you ask,  yes, even George himself brought food to my table this way.   Furthermore, I've gotten actual bad food there in recent visits. Calamari that was still pink and uncooked, for starters, how gross is that? Other times it has started to come out very soggy and spongy, rather than the crisp taste I'm used to from much earlier visits. Going back to the service problem, when George and his staff saw that we didn't touch the calamari, nobody asked and nobody cared. For the way they price it, I find it unacceptable that you bring me raw, pink calamari (soggy at that!).   All in all, I finally grew tired of the behavior of the staff, the ridiculous level of service and the fact that now, even the food was in decline. I can handle so-so food or so-so service, but I can't take both of them from the same place. Discussed with my wife and decided to find a new Greek place to dine at, so we're never returning to Greek Town.   It's a true shame, as the ambiance and the decor, the nice booths and the quiet atmosphere really, really won me over initially. I used to love this place and went there often with colleagues from work and with my family. I'm sad to see them go and to strike them off my list, but they've been given enough chance and nothing has changed. My personal prediction? They'll be out of business within a year if they keep this up."}
{"text":"Fabulous food and George makes you feel like family. What could be better? Had the Kalamari appetizer--highly recccomend! Simply amazing. Simple decor, nothing fancy, but clean and really great food."}
{"text":"We have a Greek friend in town and this was her choice (she is a former local). Anywhere the Greek women recommend, count me in! She did the ordering for us. Service is on point, calamari is amazing, baked cheese is basically flambéed in front of you, and more! We had a great time!! Definitely worth checking out if you want legit Greek food."}
{"text":"Fabulous place, food and drinks. Family owned and owner makes it a point to stop at everyone's table to talk to them. Have eaten here a few times and the calamari is to dye for. You can't go wrong by going to this place."}
{"text":"My son introduced me to this place on a quick visit to Scottsdale. He said that they would be best gyros ever-and they are. I was a little skeptical about the fries tucked in, but the food was spot on. We were too full for dessert but, we had it anyway, and we ate ALL of it. 4 people could share. There's only one dessert and it's not to be missed! We also loved George the owner, who will order for you if you aren't quick enough,  and felt entertained by what could only be an actual Greek family crying, \"opa!\" every so often. A glass was even festively shattered. Great meal and fun!"}
{"text":"I spent ast summer in Greece, and absolutely fell in love with their food. I was really hesitant to find a restaurant back in Phoenix that would serve anything even remotely close to the awesomeness of the country.  Then I found GreekTown. VERY authentic. delicious food. Everyone who I have introduced to it absolutely loves it.   Don't expect anything even close to places like My Big Fat Greek Restaurant ( Thankfully... that place is AWFUL).   It's really a fantastic local restaurant, and the owner is definitely eccentric, but a very nice guy!"}
{"text":"Considering this is owned by Greeks (father, mother and son who are on site), the quality of food is lacking.   We are from Chicago and eat authentic Greek food regularly. This isn't it.   Egg lemon soup. Should be thick, yellow colored and rich lemon flavored.   Nope...it's chicken and rice soup like out of a can with a squeeze of lemon.   I had the gyros sandwich on a pita. Came with a side salad with one Kalamata olive and some feta cheese on top. Hardly Greek salad.   Gyros was good, but they put the fries IN the sandwich. Really?  How about \"on the side\"?  My wife had the chicken George. Decent with egg lemon (too thin) sauce and artichokes and mushrooms. Greek potato. And zucchini and carrots?  Are you kidding?  What happened to Greek style green beans?  Nope.   The $5 Pinot Grigio was good...but pinot?  No rodititis?    Finally, the only dessert option is baklava cheesecake.   We passed.   The owner is sociable and they break dishes and yell \"Opa\"!  That's probably the only good part.   The food is not like your yiayia would make and it's in a dicey part of Phoenix.   Won't return. Still searching for a really good Greek restaurant in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"- The calamari was amazing.  I've never had such large calamari as tender as Greektown's.  I wanted to lick the sauce off of the plate.  - The lemon soup was ok.  I'd have liked it if it had been a little chunkier.  - The salad had great flavor and was a good sized portion.  Next time I might ask for dressing on the side though.  - The capama was a bit uneven.  Some pieces of lamb were very tender.  Others, not so much. The sauce was incredible.  Very savory and rich.  - Service was excellent."}
{"text":"Appetizers: Dolmades Beef, pork, rice stuffed grape leaves HUGE, delicious!  Tiropites Flaky phyllo dough baked with parmesan and feta cheese inside Amazing!  Saganaki Flambeau Kefalograviera (sheep's milk cheese) baked with olive oil, brought to the table in a flaming dish, drizzled with fresh squeezed lemon juice. Laid atop their thick sliced garlic bread, this is outstanding!  Spanakopites Flaky phyllo dough baked with spinach and feta cheese inside This classic Greek treat is a must have, and theirs was great!  Main courses: Pasteetso Lasagna, Greek style; Pastisio noodles with beef, tomatoes, and onions, and a cream sauce with cinnamon The potato topping was beautifully creamy!  Mousaka (a personal favorite dish) Similar to Pasteetso, but with eggplant instead of noodles Same amazing topping!  Capama Lamb stew served over rice Not my dish, but the bite I tasted was delightful  Baklava Cheesecake Oh. My. God. One of the most delicious slices of cheesecake I've ever enjoyed, served with a piece of Baklava on top, and garnished with ridiculously good hand made whipped cream, sprinkled with cinnamon The Baklava, also hand made, was also just incredible  As great as the food is, the atmosphere created by the restaurateur makes the experience so much better  Definitely must return!"}
{"text":"Best Greek food in Phoenix.  you have to try the Greek spaghetti George is a hoot and an entertainer for sure"}
{"text":"Don't judge a book by it's cover, or don't judge a restaurant by it's location or outside. Very glad a friend of mine took me here. The inside is very inviting; bathroom was super clean, and was met at the door by some great smells from the kitchen. George the owner was great. We shared the garlic calamari; very good. I had the spinach pie. Crispy and fresh and the cucumber sauce was excellent. I would put that on my shoe and eat it if I had too. Definitely will go again."}
{"text":"This is an all time family favorite ! Have had lots of Birthday celebrations at Greek town and late night dinners  George always goes out of his way to make the meals not only delicious but also entertaining  Love The Lemon Soup  ,Calamari, Shrimp George  and of course the Gyros !"}
{"text":"My family and I have been enjoying the food at Greektown for more than 30 years.   It is an outstanding restaurant -- the food and service are terrific and the prices are very reasonable.   It is a great place for a family dinner and George, the owner, will make your dining experience memorable.   And get a bottle of Nemea wine while you're at it.    Mark H"}
{"text":"Do not be deceived by the location of this establishment, I guarantee you will not be disappointed when you step into Greektown! We ordered the Kalamari and it was a different side of Calamari I have never seen, because this one was sauced with a lemon-onion herb sauce that was absolutely marvelous! Accompanied with fresh pita bread, which you could use to eat the extra sauce with! I myself had the spaghetti with meat sauce and it was delightful! I was initially a little apprehensive because the meat sauce contains cinnamon... I have to say it was the best meat sauce I have ever had! My boyfriend had the classic gyro and the meat was tender and delicious! But the main show was the baklava cheesecake for dessert! The crispy baklava was a perfect compliment to the creamy cheesecake that melted in your mouth! This is a definite staple of the 7th Street and Dunlap area! I would recommend this place to everyone who enjoys delicious home cooked food!"}
{"text":"I've dined here twice for dinner and once for lunch and I can't think of a reason that I won't be here once a month.  I'm a Greek food lover and I can't pass up a Gyro stand, either. Hell, I've even been to Greece. Problem with that is, that I'm stuck in a rut because I know what I like and I always ask for it whenever I try out a new taverna.  The things that you cannot go wrong with here: Horiatiki (salad of tomatoes, cucumbers, Kalamata olives, red onion and feta), Tzatziki (yogurt, garlic and cucumber dip with some of the best warmed pita bread you'll ever eat) the Avgolemono soup and any entree with \"George\" in its name.   Friendly service, it's never crowded and it's very affordable."}
{"text":"As others have reviewed, George is a great guy and makes this place fun to go to.  The food is good, although not as consistent as it should be.  Chicken George is my favorite on this menu.  The soups are great as well.  The service can be pretty rough sometimes, which is disappointing given that I have had some pretty rough wait staff even when the place was nearly empty.  I still go 4 stars though because the food is tasty, and George makes it a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Coming from a Greek family and working in a Greek restaurant, this was a close to what I'm used to in this area! The hosts are awesome and the food was great!!!"}
{"text":"We went based on a recommendation, ok food but over priced, on-line menu prices shown was NOT what my card was charged, $16.00 virus $17.00 for the Titan's Tortellini platter, the quantity was a joke and nothing to brag about, shouldn't be called Titan as it was a child size portion.  Dolmades dinner was listed on-line menu at $13.00 versus $14.00 and was good, not as good as Mikes Grill in Peoria, portion MUCH smaller than Mikes, I wish Mikes was till open, soup & salad included for the both of us.   The server was this wise guy owner from NY, gave no help when asked about some of the other dishes. His answer as he was yelling it across the room, just order it!!, you'll like It!!. What?? LOL... so the atmosphere was comfortable but I would have liked A HELPING HAND when ordering?        So to sum it up, Tuesday night dinner, $45.00 with tip. I could have done better elsewhere...disappointing as I was looking for this style cooking to add to my list. Will not go back"}
{"text":"This place was top notch!!!  We were seated right away, the music was so relaxing and really set the mood for the amazing meal we were about to devour!  The owner came out to take our order and told us how long they had been in the valley and that she was actually here from Greece...YES this place is the real deal and you won't be disappointed.  If you want REAL Greek food don't miss out on this place."}
{"text":"We had quite a food festive afternoon. I met a friend at this hidden gem. The owner was passionate about the food, his family, the music, and the restaurant. He was kind enough to offer some special Greek wine that wasn't on the menu. Delicious. We went from one course to another trying many delicious choices. Fried calamari was my friends favorite. The eggplant dip was very sweet and different flavor. Since I could not choose between two entrées, the owner was kind enough to split two entrées so I could try both. The grape leaves were very good, no hold up on oils and butter and calories but well worth the splurge including the dessert. Wow, we really ate a lot!  I will undoubtedly return. The music was local talent and as good as the food. The whole experience was unrushed and perfect. Till next time!"}
{"text":"Hope you have all night to wait for someone to come and take your order. After 1 1/2 hours of waiting we left. Service is non existent----is the owner really to cheap to hire a waiter? We went to pita jungle and got served immediately."}
{"text":"Lots of fun, and wonderful food, great family ran restaurant! We will be going again soon!"}
{"text":"Best Greek food you'll ever eat! You have to try it. George the owner will take great care of you and give great suggestions. I had the chicken plate and it was Awesome! Gyros are great too and lots of authentic dishes. One of my favorite places."}
{"text":"George is an excellent host. Chicken gyro is practically indistinguishable compared to gyros you would have in Greece. Can't wait to try dinner menu."}
{"text":"Amazing Greek food. Calamari is the best! George is a sweetheart and makes it entertaining."}
{"text":"so very disappointing, traveled an hour one way, bad neighborhood with a shooting shortly and robbery after our visit. Ordered saganaki to start, it was stringy and after two chews it seemed like gum in your mouth.  Ordered mousaka and petitiso, arrived room temperature.  We basically went here for the mousaka. Mousaka was mediocre at best.  Asked for a sangria, it seemed that the owner added fruit juice to a red wine and charged $8.95 Won't go back or recommend to others!"}
{"text":"Cheeky waiter/owner.  Good recommendations and good food.  Don't ask for hummos - he actually got kind offended and said this wasn't a yuppie establishment."}
{"text":"Great place, loved it!  I'm in town for one night and found this on Yelp near my hotel.  Family owned, super friendly feel and I loved the food. I had a shrimp dish (Gregiri??) Not sure of the spelling but it was super.  The two people with me had the gyro sandwich and gyro plate, both said it was excellent.  Our meals came with a small basket of pita and bread.  I didn't have the pita but ate the bread. It was warm, fresh, and very tasty.  Salad came with the meal as well and it was great too.  Overall the whole experience was terrific. The owner and his son were very nice and personable.  If I'm back in the area this will be a stop for sure."}
{"text":"The calamari appetizer was the best of my life. The toasted multi-grain bread was buttery and addicting and the avgolemono soup was perfect. The \"plato fantasia,\" or something like that (meant for two, enough for 3) was totally delish, with salmon, lamb, dolmades, some macaroni casserole-ish thing, fresh veggies and rice.   Dessert was spectacular: homemade flan, baklava, and rice pudding. The retsina didn't taste as much like turpentine as I hear it usually does.  I loved George, the owner. He told me he loved me within two minutes of entering the restaurant. To be fair, I came as the guest of two of his favorite customers...  I will definitely eat here again. I can't see myself eating Greek anywhere else in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This place is a gem.  The food is savory and delicious, the prices are extremely reasonable and the owner, George is a sweetheart.  In fact, on a recent visit, he even held and calmed my 2 month old daughter so that my husband and I could enjoy our hot entrees!  The Moussaka is a flavor explosion and you can't go wrong ordering any dish with \"George\" in the name.  We'll be back again and again as long as the doors are open!"}
{"text":"Terrific food. George the owner took great care of us and turned us on to some great music.  He knows his food and his guitar players! We recently moved to this part of town and there are just too many local joints to waste time or money on a bad one.  We will be back time and time again!  The Moussaka was delicious!"}
{"text":"Was in town for a work trip and our dinner at Greektown was definitely the highlight! The owner is full of personality and unbelievably accommodating. Between half and half orders, complementary Ouzo and a group \"Opa\", it was definitely an unforgettable meal. Oh yea... the food was great too!"}
{"text":"My favorite Greek Spot in the valley! I usually go with the Trio Sinner spacial. The calamar is to die for. My kid loves the Greek pizza as well. George and family make the experience the BEST."}
{"text":"Worst \"Greek\" food I ever had! The service was terrible.  The owner/server was obnoxious and kept running off whenever we were about to order.  I was there with my family on the recommendation of a friend.  One of my family members is Greek and he was very confused by the food. The appetizers were odd.  Calamari was very wide and rubbery. The spanikopita was deep fried. Main courses: My Moussaka consisted of about 5 inches of bechamel on top of dry potatoes with about 1/2 a teaspoon of eggplant, no meat. The veggies on the side were carrots and more potatoes that were dry and not edible. My Mom's leg of lamb was so over done and salty she had to return it. The salad was swimming in dressing. My cousin's eggplant Parmesan was decent as were the lamb chops that my Mom got as a substitute. Even the dessert, Baklava on cheesecake (which the owner practically threw onto the table) was soggy and terrible. Now that it is the morning after, my 10 year old son woke up with diarrhea which may or not be related to his dinner. It is hard to believe a place like this can remain open at all.  It is that bad. I will never go back.  I will, however, return to the Golden Greek where I know I can get good Greek food."}
{"text":"Great food, very reasonable prices!  George, the owner, is very engaged and entertaining.  How often do you go to any restaurant any more and the owner is actually there?  At this one he is serving you and is very hands on running the place.  This is one of the best locally owned spots in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This was a wonderful surprise to stumble into after a pleasant date. We were the only two at this place on a Tuesday night, with the owner serving us the most delicious Greek food!   I ate the Greek-style lasagna while my boyfriend had the beautiful delights wrapped in grape leaves. Each came with egg drop soup and a salad. Supreme and not breaking the bank!"}
{"text":"I came with a big group.  Everyone loved their meals.  We started with calamari and that was unique and amazing.  We could not get enough of it.  The meals were great and the salads were fresh, bouncy and vivid. This place is a winner."}
{"text":"The food and decor are both a little old fashioned, but solid.  Greektown is family run, and sometimes has it's problems with spotty service, but they always make up for it.  Last time I went, the house wine was very inexpensive and ended up being an extremely pleasant Pinot Grigio.  The Moussaka was lovely.  My only complaint would be that there were very few potatoes on my plate AND they were very salty-as if someone had accidentally seasoned them twice. I also wish I had been given a bit more salad.   The owner bought us all a shot of Ouzo to make up for some rough spots in the service and we all left happy.   Before I forget, my friend had the Grexican and RAVED about it.   Anytime someone suggests going there I immediately agree, even though it's a tad pricy for every day for me.  It's a wonderful feeling to go to a restaurant run by a family.  I suggest you go!"}
{"text":"I love that this space is locally owned and run by the owner.  The food is wonderful and my family had a wonderful time!"}
{"text":"Pros: The owner is very personable and so the customer service ends up being great.  The bread appetizers are delicious! The apple-lemonade-tea drink is very refreshing& tasty. The place is finely decorated and has an authentic feel.  Cons: The classic euro was pretty good but nothing more than that. The Mediterranean salad had a very mild flavor...one of my least favorites that ive tried.  The owner paired my Mediterranean salad with the other person's salad (they had gotten a lunch item which came with a side salad) so the food was less...."}
{"text":"Ive been to greek town many times and i have never been dissapointed. I had the Greek lasagna (the patstitsio) the last time I was there, and it was terrific. This dish is a Greek classic! It was delicious. George is a great host.  I will be back again for sure."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing service, food and atmosphere. It's so hard nowadays to run a good restaurant with outstanding customer service. Our server was the owner and he actually cares about his customers . Don't forget about the food . We had the calamari dish first and WOW. Such a unique taste, I couldn't stop eating. The most important thing to mention is there Classic Gyro sandwich....TRY IT  Wonderful restaurant with wonderful service, couldn't ask for more."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in after visiting my daughter at the hospital nearby. It was late (after 8:00 pm) and they were busy, so we waited for 15 minutes for our table. The food coming out looked delicious.  We got into our booth and the service was very good.   My husband and I both had the saganaki (Oopa!) flaming cheese, which George (owner) made sure it melted nicely before letting the flame go out. It was delicious. We also both had the gyros platter. They were very good, tasty, plenty of food. The yummy egg-lemon soup and Greek salad made the dinner complete.   My only real criticism: for a place with so many authentic Greek dishes, PLEASE make gyros the traditional way-on the vertical barbecue and cut the meat to order. These were pre cut, formed slices of gyros- about as far from authentic as you can get; their only saving grace was their good flavor.  But I missed the char, spices and chew of authentic Greek gyros.  This is the only reason I'm giving then 4 stars instead of 5.    My 4 year old granddaughter had the Greek spaghetti, which had a good hit of cinnamon flavor; a nice departure from our Italian family's flavors.   The owner -George - is a character, and the place looks and feels like the type of friendly neighborhood place you want to be in again and again.  Regulars were hugging George and their waitstaff on the way out. A great experience and one we will return to soon.   4/23/2016 Returned here while daughter was waiting for a procedure. Had their trio sampler, with moussaka, pastitsio, and cheese puffs. Excellent!  Also found out that the gyros I thought were not authentic were actually made by the owner. He roasts the gyro loaf to rare, cuts it to order, then finishes it up on the grill. Still doesn't taste the same as the more traditional version, but explains the great flavor he achieved.   George is great, service awesome. Go!  OOPA!"}
{"text":"Best tzatziki I've ever had, hands down. The mousaka was incredible, the lemon soup was delicious, and the baklava cheesecake for dessert had REAL WHIPPED CREAM. You HAVE to try this place :)"}
{"text":"Delicious food, friendly staff, sweet ambience. We had Greek lasagna, chicken and mushrooms, and the flaming cheese. Great experience! Thank you for everything Greek Town"}
{"text":"Such a fun time! The service was amazing and friendly! The restaurant is family owned and has amazing food and so worth the price! Has a great atmosphere. I was shocked that such a great restaurant, fun, sit down restaurant was in the Sunnyslope area of Phoenix. I will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Had such a cool experience here. Went on a weekend for dinner and were seated promptly. We were well taken care of by the owner and staff. Food and ambiance were excellent. It is a quaint little restaurant. Bread (including warm and chewy pita) is served as an appetizer and it is all delicious! Ordered the grilled chicken salad and gyro entrees and both were very good. We don't order appetizers or dessert, so can't comment on this.  I highly recommend this place. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Delicious Food and Great Atmosphere! This just might be the best kept secret in Phoenix! If you love Greek Food, you gotta try this little spot"}
{"text":"I travel to Greece twice a year. By far this is the best Greek restaurant in town. The owners are amazing and the food is even better. You can't go wrong here."}
