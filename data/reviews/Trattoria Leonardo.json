{"text":"Delicious little find. Food was fantastic! Atmosphere was relaxed and casual. Fresh Bruschetta to start followed by beautiful green salad, delicious pasta entree, and yummy spumoni dessert. Wonderful serve from Sam!"}
{"text":"Fast friendly and delicious.  The decor is from the 1970's but food was on point and delicious.  Chianti by the glass was great.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Have been driving by this restaurant for quite some time now and finally had a chance to visit. And it was a great local dinner. 

Bruschetta on the house was quickly brought to the table. Food was delicious, service was old style good. Not the greatest ambiance, but the food and price/value more than makes up for it. We will be back. 

Salad, entree, dessert, coffee and wine for two was $100"}
{"text":"We love our neighbourhood trattoria!  Old School waiters in white shirts make you feel at home and the food is outstanding.  Daily specials always tempt and are great value.

Helpings are generous and the variety ensures everyone can satisfy their palate.  Wines are priced fairly and the list offers a decent range of wines/regions.

The atmosphere is anything but pretentious but the food speaks volumes!

Complementary bruschetta greeted us the last time we dined and other surprises often await friendly/repeat patrons.

Parking can be a challenge on the Dundas side but more is available at the back.

Well worth the trip."}
{"text":"I've written a previous review where I gave this place 5 stars.  I don't know, it's just not measuring up anymore.  This place used to be a failsafe Etobicoke Italian restaurant, complete with formally dressed old waiters.  The menu is huge, but needs an update as well as the decor.  The couple of times I've eaten here in the past year, it's not what it used to be.  I would love to see this place be as great as it used to be, and have a bit of a facelift!"}
{"text":"Authentic Italian food. Large portions and very tasty. Te service was great, very attentive. Overall good meal and affordable."}
{"text":"A sure thing - 'Leonardo's', as my family fondly calls it, is faithfully old school Canadian-Italian. From the carpeted floors and white tablecloths to the seasoned gentlemen waiters in black and white.

You know there's a good reason the majority of customers are older and well-known by staff. They've been coming back again and again for years. Well count me in cuz I'm hooked.

There are so many great menu choices you'll have to bring a gang and pass the plate every few minutes.

The Lasagna is an absolute favourite for my whole family;
The veal is delicious whichever way you order it;
Eggplant parm...is more like a veggie 'steak' on your plate;
Meatballs are awesome....
Calabrese salad the way Nona used to make it (only they use halepenio);
...and thank you for the always complimentery fresh bruschetta.
My ultimate favourite italian food is not actually on the menu (linguine a la vodka)...but that's not a problem! They are more than happy to accommodate me...it actually says so on their menu and it's soooo perfect. I love it again and again.
I highly recommend this gem."}
{"text":"First time there and the first impression was wow, this place reminds me of grandma's house. The pasta dish was all pasta, not enough chicken or asperagus in it and the bruschetta tasted a little bit funny, like it had been stored in a closet or a dawer or something, it had a funky taste to it. The service was fine."}
{"text":"Ended up here today for dinner although it wasn't planned.  Wasn't quite sure what to expect but was really impressed.  I am normally not a huge fan of going out to Italian restaurants as I don't feel most are very authentic and I could probably make a lot of the food at home.  This restaurant deserves its good reviews as the food is authentic and the staff are lovely.   I also loved the quaintness of the interior.   The dinner crowd was also quite surprising given the location and a Tuesday evening.  My rigatoni with sausage and chicken was seasoned very well and the bruschetta and bread was nice as well.   Wish I had room for dessert and espresso as it would have been the perfect finish to s great dinner."}
{"text":"Probably one of Etobicokes best kept secrets! Been a fan of their old world classic service and outstanding entrees at a price that absolutely cannot be beat. Go there once. You'll be returning for life! Just ask anyone whose been ! 

Dinner for 2 , Appetizers , and a nice bottle of wine under a 100 with tip. WHAT !"}
{"text":"My husband and I go out for dinner here every once in awhile, especially for special occasions, and we have never been disappointed. The veal Gorgonzola is our favorite dish and it is amazing! So delicious and fresh. The staff here is so very kind and friendly and very professional. We had an altercation about parking with another Italian takeout place in the plaza (Lenny's lasagna, terrible terrible place & the rudest staff) and the staff here went out of their way to make us feel welcome and smooth everything over, thank you for that. You are courteous and have the proper respect for your customers that other places terribly lack. Thank you for a great evening and as always some very delicious food :)"}
{"text":"The food was extremely good the decor needs updating but would love to eat there again has a touch of romance to it too I would recommend to Chianti very tasty .... it will not break your budget"}
{"text":"Not great by a landslide. My gnocchi with tomato sauce was served lukewarm and basically mush with zero flavour. I tried to save it with salt and cheese but that didn't work. I was hoping to add some semblance of flavour with chili flakes but they were no where to be found. My boyfriend's lasagna was much better due to the meat. It added some much needed flavour but neither of us were blown away. The bread they gave us was kind of stale and at the end of the meal they didn't ask if we wanted separate bills, they just assumed my boyfriend would be paying. Giving me my takeout container since I could barely manage half my food and my boyfriend the bill (saying this is for you, and this (the bill) is for you). I would never go back."}
{"text":"One of the only times I've been led astray by Yelp.

This restaurant is quite poor. Maybe not the WORST food ever, but probably should cost about 1/2 of what it does. 

Ceasar salad entire contents: slimy dressing, a single crouton, iceberg lettuce ($5.75). Two bites and it was enough already.

I asked if there a bowl of olives I could order for the table and the waiter suggested I order a Caprese salad (?) which had olives. So I did that. ($5.50) 

The Caprese salad was: a sliced tomato, sliced jalape√±o peppers, some onions, and oil. No olives. I asked the waiter for some and he came out and poured them on to my plate from a bowl.

He offered pepper, which I obliged. After about 2 twists of that pepper mill I said \"Ok, that's good\" and he did it another 6 times. ...Interesting.

I ordered spaghetti and meatballs for dinner (how mange cake, I know). There were two medium sized meat balls on either side of the plate, slightly over cooked spaghetti noodles, and one of the blander tomato sauces I've had in memory.

I asked for pepper and again, he put on about 4-5x the amount I asked for. Had to ask him three times to stop putting pepper on it. Very strange.

The mains were in the range of $11 or so to about $18 and a half litre of not-great red is $19. Very overpriced wine. Very underwhelming food."}
{"text":"This is an old school Italian restaurant that looks like it's straight out of the 80s. The service and food are very good. The menu has traditional Italian fare such as pastas and everything is prepared well. They are generous with their portions and the servers are very polite and efficient. They give some extras on the house which is really nice and appreciated."}
{"text":"We were visiting Toronto for a long weekend and staying by the airport to save money.  While driving back to the hotel on a Saturday night, we decided to take the long way back along Dundas Street.

We passed the Trattoria Leonardo.  The lot was packed, and we felt like Italian.  We pulled in and whipped out my smartphone to read the reviews for the place.  Mostly mixed, but we gave it a try based upon the full lot.

First impression by the nose was this was going to be good.  It was busy, and we were seated right away.  Place was dim but not dim enough to see the filthy carpeting.  Luckily we didn't eat on the floor.  The place was in need of refurbishment if it is going to be open for the long term.

Service was very good.  Menu was large in selection, and they were open to variances for dietary needs.  My aunt and nephew shared a Caesar Salad which they were kind enough to split for them in the kitchen.  I had my own.  Anchovies were not offered.  It was good, but not outstanding.  Reasonable for the size at $5.95. A plate with 6 complimentary pieces of Bruschetta were delivered for 3 people. The Bruschetta needed salt.

I ordered garlic bread to have with the salads ($3.95) as we were not offered a bread basket with dinner.  Four thin slices of a toasted baguette covered with a thick paste of overpowering garlic puree.  Don't do it.

Our entrees were Fettucine Alfredo @14.95. Chicken Alpina (Chicken with a mushroom cream grappa sauce) @17.95, and Chicken Parmagiana @15.95.  The Chicken choices were offered with Pasta or Vegetables.  I inquired about the rack of Lamb which was actually a half rack (3 ribs) for $23.95 but passed for the chicken.

All three entrees were underseasoned, but the pastas were cooked perfect al dente.

To summarize--tired looking place, very good service, reasonable prices, and if you're willing to add salt, pepper, and/or cheese to your food, then this place will do."}
{"text":"This is one of the best small Italian food places in Toronto.  Nice and quite inside, perfect for a date night. Also a great place to get to if you live in Etobicoke. 

Everything I've ever ordered there is amazing.  From apps, to pastas,  and entres.  Really inexpensive and amazing quality.  Personal favorite is the vitello a la portafoglio. 

Only complaint is front parking is limited but there is additional parking around back."}
{"text":"This restaurant is endearingly old-school: worn-out, red velvet carpet with chairs from the 1950s and kind Italian waiters.

There are two sections to this restaurant and we were seated in the smaller, cozier area. 

The menu is varied-Italian fare and warning, the main portions are quite substantial. This isn't refined Italian, but rather, almost \"American-like\" with food buried under oodles of melted cheese. But, there is nothing wrong with that!

I was very happy they had Antinori here and quickly ordered a bottle for the table. I had the Veal which was cooked in a mushroom sauce which was great. My future father-in-law ordered some noodle dish that looked more like Shanghai Noodles and vegetables than Italian...he mentioned it wasn't the best. In other words, stick with the traditional pastas.

Service was excellent and our wine glasses were never empty."}
{"text":"Not bad at all!  Outdated and worn decor, but great friendly service, classic pastas well prepared and very affordable!  Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Excellent value for the money. we were six people looking for the authentic Italian experience and the Trat. Leo delivered. From the bushetta arriving with out being ordered (or charged for!) to the bottles of Campifoini Masa at a great price, to the mussels and calamari fritti and all of our mains. the food was excellent. And we especially enjoyed the service. Our waiter was old school and as Italian as you get. He made the evening such an enjoyable experience start to finish. Felt like we were dining in an Italian home of an old friend. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"A local gem! I've had so many great dinners here I can't even begin to choose a favourite. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Tucked in a mall on Dundas St. opposite Montgomery's Inn, Leonardo's serves classic Italian-Canadian food in an elegant, charmingly retro atmosphere. The waitstaff are all older, attentive and professional, and they all speak italian!  I have so many great things to say about this place, which serves food that is both upscale and comfortingly home-style.
For example, we were there recently for a Mother's Day Eve (Saturday) dinner. We were promptly offered water, our orders were taken and we received complimentary bruschetta, which was delicious. The tomatoes tasted so fresh and complimented the bread nicely. We shared appetizers of garlic bread, calamari and grilled shrimp. All were excellent: the garlic bread had a full, garlic flavour, the calamari done perfectly and the shrimp were substantial with a very fresh taste. Very good house wine list too. We went with the very good Baby Amarone on the list.
Leonardo's seems to specialize in veal, so I ordered the Veal Gorgonzolo: good gorgonzola flavour in the creamy sauce, tender veal, mushrooms and a really large side of pasta. Everyone agreed that this was one of the two star dishes at our table, the other one being the Osso Buco. It had the richest, deepest beef gravy, and the amazingly fall-apart tender osso buco. Our party had also ordered very delicious dishes in addition to these: veal marsala, canneloni. and chicken with mushrooms and pesto cream sauce. All of them were very good. Did I mention that the portions are also very large?

The desserts were great - the ice creams, tira misu and creme caramel were what we ordered - not overly sweet but very refreshing. Rather large portions, suitable for sharing.

From the decor to the waitstaff to the decor to the  food, Leonardo's was an excellent experience - highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great classic Italian restaurant with awesome staff makes you feel right at home.   Worth every penny. Will dine here again without question.  The food was well cooked, served in good time, tasted fresh, and prepared with love."}
{"text":"Extremely mediocre fare, quiet restaurant, nice dining room (albeit dated), free bruchetta &  bread, food came quickly, but service was \"interesting\".

A veg/trout and pasta/char dish were mixed up so  here is what the waiter did.. he said \"no problem\", then proceeded to take the trout from one plate and switch it with the pasta dish right in front of us! Didn't he care that the trout already had a bite taken out of it and he was putting it on someone else's plate to eat? weird.

As for the food, it was really standard. Pasta dishes were kind of bland and overcooked, gnocchi was nice, veal dishes were okay but nothing was enough to write home about.

All in all, I would say that it was a good place to stop off at in the rain."}
{"text":"This place is just ok. When we got there the waiter brought us bruschetta  to our table, it was really good. we ordered calamari to start....meh I've had better. I ordered the veal parmigiana and my bf had the chicken parm. Honestly, the food is just alright. I enjoy my food with a lot of flavour and this was very plain. Not the best italian food. The service was good, the waiters are friendly. I was just hoping for the taste of basil or garlic....or Something besides tomatoes."}
{"text":"I've visited many times over the years (my mom and step dad are fairly regular visitors here) and always enjoyed my experience.

The decor itself is dated, but don't let that fool you. You'll experience excellent service and delicious, satisfying, quality Italian food.

The most recent time I visited with my mom this week and we had a lovely time. Since we are trying to \"be good\" and watch our intake (I am getting married in September!) we ordered a bit more healthy options.

To start, we opted for the tomato salad with hot peppers, onions, and olives - delicious and fresh. For my main, I selected the grilled salmon with fresh veggies and my mom went with the lobster tails with veggies. The salmon was cooked perfectly and my mom loved her meal as well.

Sadly, we didn't order any dessert on this visit but hopefully next time we can indulge!

A nice extra for my Yelper friends : right now, if you check in, you enjoy $10 off a purchase of $70 or more - sweet!"}
{"text":"Excellent! Very tasteful! Full of flavour! Good price for what you get! Free bruschetta and butter and bread!"}
{"text":"This is truly a hidden gem, another amazing Italian restaurant find for me! Score!

I found this place just like most places from the 2012 Entertainment book, otherwise I would never know what I was missing, delicious Italian food!

We called beforehand to see if there was room for 3 of us after having a crazy night and attempting round 3 for finding a place to have dinner and for the win was Trattoria Leonardo!

We were seated immediately and asked if we were the ones who phoned ahead, and to our surprise we were brought out bruschetta on the house! 

We all ordered the veal parmigiana, one with veggies and two with linguine in Alfredo sauce. Everything was EXCELLENT! The veal was like candy and usually I am the last to finish my meal but tonight was a different story. It was so delicious. The veal has lots of cheese and sauce. The linguine was just as good, done just right with excellent sauce!

This is a true authentic Italian restaurant
- A Hidden Gem
- A Must Try
- Excellent Service
- Amazing Food
- Prices are Reasonable 
- Worth the Trip

I highly recommend you come here, I promise it is worth the trip! 

You can thank me later (:"}
{"text":"Date night! An excuse to get dressed up and try a \"fancier\" resto.

We arrived around 5:00 on a Friday and the restaurant was half full.  We were seated at a cozy table for two in the back corner by the mural.  They do have bruschetta on the menu, but they also give it to you complimentary along with some plain bread.  I enjoyed the bruschetta but the crust was a little too hard for my gums.  Other than that, all flvours were present. I decided to order my go to veal parm and the bf got the stuffed chicken.  We also ordered a ceasar salad to start which was a pretty generous portion.  We mentioned to the waiter that we were going to share and they split the order onto two plates before serving. Nice! The salad was generously dressed but was missing a certain something.  Maybe not enough garlic?  It was still enjoyable though.  Our mains didn't take too long to come out.  Very big portion.  My boyfriend and I were not a big fan of the pasta..  It was pretty large in size and not as soft as I would've liked it to be.  I prefer a smaller penne that they use in most restaurants. The veal was nice and cheesy.  No complaints.  My boyfriend's stuffed chicken was exactly how I make mine, which is obviously bombass.  For dessert,I HAD to try their tiramisu.  It was odd looking and I don't understand how they got it onto the plate lol.  I was not a fan of it and would not order again.  The cake portion was a little too dense.  There was so much cream.  Yes, it was light, but all the ingredients did not mesh well together.  I felt like it was just everywhere. My boyfriend enjoyed the lightness of the cream though.  

The only thing I kind of got 'sad' about lol, is when I asked our waiter to take a photo of us before our meal, he said he was too busy and would come back later.  He wasn't rude or anything about it, but I just felt so rejected lol.  No one has ever turned me down at a restaurant when I've asked to take a picture,  I understand he was busy, I just felt so *insert mouth open emoji*.  He did come back, of course while were eating and I politely declined.  Helllooo, we're eating.  At the end of everything, he did end up taking our photo.  

Another thing was that he seemed annoyed when he brought our bill unannounced and then I told him I had a $10 off coupon.  He didn't come back to our table after dessert and I kept trying to get his attention to ask for the bill.  He ended up just coming with the bill without us asking.  I WOULD have told him beforehand, if I had gotten his attention.   He was just deadass so busy. Other than those two things, meal and atmosphere was good.  Every table was full by the time we left.  All servers are older males.  Think servers at La Castile or Zorro's."}
{"text":"I live right next door to the place so I had to  see what everyone was raving about. 
I won't lie: can you find much better in Etobicoke? Yes. Absolutely.
The decor is very dated and the fake flowers are dusty and appear dirty. But for the most part, the place is fairly clean with plenty of seating in the two dining rooms.

Food-wise, I've had a few different pasta dishes and I question whether or not their Alfredo sauce is made from scratch. Tasted very much processed and therefore, I would not recommend it. I did however thoroughly enjoy the Bolognese sauce & angel hair pasta.

I continue to get each time the Antipasto plate... Thoroughly delicious! Each time, it is slightly different. The Mussels are excellent and great value for your money. The homemade Tiramisu is huge and a must have, even shared.

This is a neighbourhood restaurant that has been a staple for many. The old charm service makes it irresistible. I simply tell others: keep your expectations to a min-med level and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Similar with other reviews -decor is very dated but the food is terrific and reasonably priced.

Fettuccine with seafood & tomato sauce - heaps of seafood and sauce was seasoned right - not overly salty like many hipster Italian Resto.
Veal with white wine and asparagus- nice tender meat. 
Homemade tiramisu- delicious, moist and also well balanced in flavor. 

Overall enjoyed it very much dinner for 2 with drinks and dessert for $50.  Authentic Italian food with amazing flavours- will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Leonardo's is an adaption of Italian food which was brought over by the second migration of Italians  to Canada from Southern Italy post World War 2 untill the late 80s. It embodies ItaCanadian food and does it very well.

A restaurant like Leonardo's is becoming a rarity in the city as restaurants like this really don't exist and is very culturally significant to the history of cuisine in this city.  

If you're going to this restaurant you're not going to take photos of your food and post it on Instagram to share with all your friends.

  You go here to Mangia Bene 

And no you don't put cheese on linguine pescatore Mangia cakes"}
{"text":"I know there are mixed reviews for this place but let me say this. Yes the decor is outdated, the waiters are stuck in the 80's but the food is great if you order it the way you want. I live very close by and have been many times. Order exactly what you want an forget the menu. They will make you what you want.."}
{"text":"Not very impressive, just average their is not much to talk about.
Pros: 
Clean
Fresh 

Con:
Average Italian food 
Decor is really bad and it feel very dusty and old"}
{"text":"THANK YOU YELPERS FOR BRINGING ME HERE!

Called to make a reservation for my 21st birthday dinner with the family, and I was greeted with \"Thrah-thorrreeyah Leonarrrdho,\" aka the name of the place in a beautifully authentic Italian accent. I had called to ask about the menu options, but really, I was sold right from that point.

From beginning to end, our dining experience was characterized by that 100% authentic Italian hospitality feel. Service was genuine, warm, friendly, and most importantly, not too overbearing! I don't think I appreciated the art of waiting (waitering?) until I came to this place - they knew exactly when to check in, and when to leave us to enjoy ourselves. The food was hearty and creamy, in exactly the right way. Proportions were VERY generous, so although we were too full for dessert, we got to enjoy our dishes again the next day. The chardonnay got me to my happy place.

It's a truly authentic and inviting restaurant."}
{"text":"Thank you fellow yelpers for the find. Have drove past this place a million times. 
My wife made reservations for my birthday as I love Italian food. This place did not disappoint. The service was fantastic. They brought a plate of complimentary bruschetta. I had the Caesar salad which I enjoyed. For the main course I had the Veal Parmesan with spaghetti and meat sauce. I really enjoyed my meal and it was a healthy serving. The rest of the family enjoyed their meal as well. They do not have a children's menu but told us to pick an item and they would child size it and reduce the cost.
The place is dated but very clean. My only complaint is that their is very minimal parking.
I would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Really good italian food and service.  I will recommend it to my friends. A bit pricey though."}
{"text":"We had reservations for 6:30 on a Sunday and when we arrived there were several filled tables. We didn't order any appetizers, and the waiter brought out some bruschetta that was on the house. It was a nice touch but the bread was extremely crunchy and the topping was just all right. My husband ordered veal and penne and I had the linguine alfredo. My dish was nothing special, a little too dry for my liking but the pasta was good. I tasted my husband's order and it was very good and I wished I had ordered the same! The veal was just the way I like it and the tomato sauce was delicious! If you're looking for a place that has excellent food presentation, you won't find it here. This is definitely a \"mom & pop\" kinda place. We're willing to here again as they must be doing something right to stay in business for as long as they have (this is given away by the dated decor that comes straight out of the 80s)."}
{"text":"As many have already said, the decor is very dated, but we didn't let that bother us. The waiters were so attentive, and very nice. The food was so delicious, and the portions were quite large. I ordered the spaghetti with meatballs, which was great - very flavourful. My boyfriend ordered the pasta Arrabiata, which he enjoyed very much. We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Very impressed, food was delicious and the service impeccable! Rack of lamb is to die for, perfectly paired with house Chianti! Buon appetito"}
{"text":"Third visit as good as the first two!  Great service, those guys are pros!!  Excellent food!  Every neighborhood needs a place like this!  See you again next time I'm in Toronto!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem in Etobicoke, Leonardo's is actually one of my favourite Italian places ever. No pizzas here. Pastas and main courses. A great spot for seafood lovers. Their mussles starter in a spicy soup is ridiculously good. Pastas can be done gluten free. The wait staff is all older gentlemen and they are friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. A nice wine list here too. I usually get the seafood pasta. Great desserts. All in all sumptuous Italian, romantic decor, affordable prices...it is like going to a small town restaurant in Italy!"}
{"text":"Mama Mia!  What a great find! My hubby has been coming here sine he was a kid and I had heard stories about this place..so when he finally brought me here on our most recent trip to TO, I was excited.

Cute little mom n pop shop in etobicoke, not at all very assuming. Warm service and attentive waiters. We started with the Caesar salad and escargot which were both mind blowing! Very affordable too with the escargot at only 7$!  I had the penne a la Dr. Shivago (a la vodka) which was so good, creamy and just had the right amount of smoke from the salmon. My husbands veal with Gorgonzola was absolutely to die for. I made sure to sop the rest of the sauce with some bread. Portions are generous and again prices are extremely reasonable. Between the quality of food, service, and affordability, this place gets a strong 5 star from me!"}
{"text":"Whole in the wall kinda restaurant. No music playing very nice waiters I forgot is name I think it was Sam such a lovely guy. Food was sooo good don't eat before you go the portions are big oh wait the calamari SO GOOD! Tiramisu was alright not a big fan of it myself anyway. Everything tasted fresh."}
