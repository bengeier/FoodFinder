{"text":"Better than NY, better than Berlin.  If you love pho look no further. My fav is the seafood pho. 

A pho lives or dies by its broth...this place has the cleanest best tasting broth I've ever had"}
{"text":"Awesome place to eat! It may not  look like much on the outside, but trust me...this place has some of the tastiest food in town!

Chicken, Rice and Vegetables
BBQ chicken with rice
Mango Shake.

Friendly and fast service...good portion sizes and decent prices. Highly recommended if you're looking for a good, fast, affordable meal."}
{"text":"Pho is wonderful on cold days, rainy days, days that are both, and those that are everything in between. Heck, sometimes it's just satisfying to go ham on a bowl for kicks - the feeling at the end is like nothing else, full but not stuffed, warm and fuzzy. Heaven.

I got a lead on some really exceptional Pho being dolled out in Downtown Brampton by some local pals, so given that it was lunch time, I was in the area and I had missed breakfast - this was a win on all sides for me.

It's not elegant or crazy fancy inside, it's simple, and that's what a good Pho spot needs ot be, simple with a focus on good food. It's definitely family owned and operated and despite my comment about the simplicity of the space it's also Super clean (rigorously so as the staff seemed to be cleaning or tidying constantly while I was there) - good sign because if they're that conscious of the restaurant being clean then you can bet that same attention to detail is taken with the food.

And it was! I walked in and without looking at the menu knew I was going to have a #9 (Special Pho with everything - Beef tendon, rare beef, beef balls and brisket) in a medium size.

The medium was more than enough when it hit the table and the broth looked perfect. Not overly oily and no visible signs of negatives. Quality! I decided to dispense with my usual Hoisin and sriracha sauce overload and just added the thai basil, chili pepper and sprouts. WOW. The true flavours of the broth were incredible. Clean and full of rich beef flavour - I was hooked. Noodles were a little clumped together at the beginning but they gradually moved apart and were also cooked perfectly.

The real star of the dish tho was the meat, incredibly high quality, I was shocked! I could taste the seasoning in the beef balls, and they didn't have that rubbery feel that some do. The brisket melted in my mouth it was so tender, and the rare beef and tendon were both equally amazing

Total bill came to just over $9 (tax in). Are you kidding? Amazing!

This spot is a little bit of a trek from my place but it's my personal new go-to spot when in Brampton. Check it out!

Earcrest Out!"}
{"text":"Hmmmm, not to sure what Bernie C is talking about as this place is no where near Oceans.

To be honest this place is not the most elegant restaurant you will ever go to, but you will be hard pressed to find a better pho place in the GTA.

Prices are very reasonable and portions in my opinion are huge. The broths they conjure up are delicious. Whether you like beef based our seafood broths this place will not disappoint.

Also they are very accommodating, and are just a great little family owned restaurant that delivers amazing food. If you get a chance also try out the fresh deep friend spring rolls. Wish I had not written their review I differently have a craving for their pho :(

$8.50 for the Large Pho not exactly breaking the bank!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite Pho restaurants. Good food at a fair price. The service is quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Had the pho special from this little joint next to Oceans.  Prices are reasonable and food was fairly good, however I found the portions a bit smaller than normal and slightly pricier.  Like maybe $0.50 to $0.75 more expensive.  Not a big deal and maybe it's because I'm spoiled by the abundance of Vietnamese places in Mississauga.

Overall, it's good for the area but nothing to go out of your way for."}
{"text":"4th visit to this place in the heart of Brampton downtown . Mostly busy during lunch but evenings are low n space is easily available .
Kitchen right in the centre of the restaurant .
Great fragrance !
Tried Brisket Pho n as usual it was nice , tasty , perfectly cooked to perfection !"}
{"text":"Decent pho.  not the best cut of beef. 
Only dark meat for chicken. 
If I end up back in the awful city that is Brampton, I'd try elsewhere next time..."}
{"text":"On a lot of recommendations I  tried this place its on the Main Street Brampton 
Tried the brisket pho  It was absolutely superb The best 
The restaurant closes at 9 pm and I was there at 8.50 pm The owner was really good and was helpful and took our order 
We ordered our number 17 pho with beef brisket 
It was a  clear soup wth lots of yummy and delicious  beef brisket in it Excellent flavour  really really good Add bean sprouts in it and it's the best 
The aroma flavours and taste of the pho is  to die for  so full of  flavours  and great taste  Very very  filling A full meal in itself  
A must try"}
{"text":"The place looks really run down and out-dated inside.

As a Vietnamese, I have been to many pho restaurants and tried many family recipes.
Maybe it's because I've been spoiled with good pho, but this place isn't that spectacular. When I received my pho, the noodles were all clumped together, the broth didn't taste that amazing-I would eat it, but I wouldn't go out of my way to rave about it.
I also ordered a mango shake, there were too many icy bits, I couldn't finish it., it wasn't really that appetizing.

HOWEVER, I am really quite pleased with the customer service. Most family owned restaurants don't care about being friendly, because well in most cases, a family member won't fire another family member. Except this restaurant is really fast and friendly. I would go here just because the location is convenient and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I love this place. I've been going here for pho for almost ten years.  It's not pretty, but the food is awesome, the prices are ridiculously low (better than the three other Vietnamese places in Brampton I've visited), and the service is impeccable. Jackie, the owner, is always there, and his mother (I'm pretty sure) works in the kitchen. He remembers my order, even when I call it in over the phone. I highly reccommend Pho Viet Nam for authentic, delicious, and affordable food!"}
{"text":"A small sign marks the entrance to this seemingly dingy little place.  If you weren't looking for it, you probably wouldn't even notice it.

But as they say, 'don't judge a book by it's cover'.  This little family run gem is packed with City Hall and other local business workers at lunch time.

The food here is surprisingly good and very cheap!  The menu is extensive and offers something for everyone.  The staff is very friendly and accommodating.

Be sure to try the spring rolls.  They are a house specialty and definitely one of a kind!"}
