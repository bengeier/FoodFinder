{"text":"This is one of the best places to eat in carrigaline.  Great food and friendly staff. Can be very busy on Sundays."}
{"text":"Went there once and never again. Firstly the food was only acceptable! For my starter I made the choice of getting the chicken wings, I could of made them myself! You could tell they weren't just cooked and were reheated, and the hoisin sauce was from a packet. For the main I picked the prawn scampi, it's was a tiny portion and only got a small amount of chips! I went there hungry and came home still hungry and disappointed! Most of the staff were very pleasant and made the visit enjoyable but had a very rude and unwelcoming waiter. That is what made the meal so unbearable, I just wish I got his name before I left, to complain him to the owner!"}
{"text":"Went here with a large family group.   If you happen to go with a large group book it well in advance and request a table upstairs.   Otherwise you'll get a table just inside the door in a hallway and it was drafty with the door opening and closing.   I had the crispy duck salad starter which was very good.   The fajitas,  Cajun pasta,  chicken salad,  falafel burger were only OK.   Wish it was of better quality for the price.   Service was very good though."}
