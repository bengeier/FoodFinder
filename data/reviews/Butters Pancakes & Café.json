{"text":"All I can say is I have NEVER had a bad breakfast at Butters (everything on the menu is amazing!)  I love their fresh ground coffee/espresso/lattes.    Do not let the \"wait\" time scare you off; they are so super fast and efficient.    The weekend staff is amazing, especially Danny who really takes the time to get to know all the regulars.  I highly recommend Butters to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"Wow are we glad we found Butters! Was searching for a new breakfast place and happened on Butters. Nice neighborhood spot, family friendly, clean restaurant with seating inside and outside patio with umbrellas. Greeted by friendly hostess and seated pretty quick, wonderful friendly waitress! Awesome coffee, including coffee barista for special drinks, fresh squeezed orange juice. We had delicious fresh blueberry pancakes and a great fresh ingredient California scrambler. We will be back to try more of their beautifully prepared breakfasts!"}
{"text":"5 stars simply because they call themselves a pancake & cafe place and they live up to it. The pancakes were the perfect amount of fluffy. Their syrup also A+. Specialty coffees A+.   Most breakfast food places do the whole extremely huge portion that you'll never finish thing. This place gives you the perfect portion. Something you can actually finish!    I will admit, the wait was a little long but well worth it."}
{"text":"If you want a very hearty breakfast or lunch this is the place to go! Great outside patio dining but beware that you will always have a wait to get in to this place - it's busy all day and it closes early afternoon."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast places around! The fresh squeezed orange juice is amazing and not too many places have true on location fresh squeezed. The skillets are super tasty and I like to get the pancakes as a side. I had the wild berry and they were so good! You can tell everything is quality and they put the food together with the right amount of ingredients. I wanted to take a picture but it looked so good I ate it first. There's always next time 'cause I will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"Pretty standard breakfast restaurant that provides the classic breakfast dishes. Very friendly staff and reasonable pricing. I had the corned beef hash skillet with over easy eggs and sourdough toast. It was enough food that I didn't finish, which isn't very typical and for only $9.45, so it's a fair trade in my opinion. The eggs were cooked perfectly as well as the potatoes, perfectly golden with those crunchy bits that bring out a good potato flavor. The corned beef was a little mutilated for me, it almost like it was ground it was so finely chopped and although it was good, it could've had a little more flavor, maybe some green chiles or just some onions in the mix of things to give it a bit of zing to it."}
{"text":"The wait was long so don't expect to walk right in. Food was great! Great espresso and freshly squeezed orange juice and food at a great price! Our waiter Indira was very sweet and nice. She always kept checking up on us too. I wanted fried eggs, basically sunny side up eggs without the sun, and my waiter tried but the cooks refused to make it that way so I had to get sunny side up and eat around the yolk. But that didn't ruin the meal just was a little disappointing since they are a breakfast/brunch place so you should be able to get eggs how you want them. Would definitely come back though!"}
{"text":"First try for breakfast here. The service was good with plenty of staff to help. The food on the other hand was just so-so. I had a skillet breakfast that was made from a can with little to no flavor and an overload of potatoes. My pancakes were heavy and had a bad batter taste, eggs were undercooked. The pportions were big, but who wants to eat a lot of bad food? Probably will not return with so many better places in the Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times. first time unimpressed with anything but figured everyone deserves a second chance.  food was mediocre at best, not bad but not good. service was amateur at best, pancakes were tough, over easy where over medium well. Bacon cold and limp, probably sits in a pan off to the side.  Was meeting a friend there today  at 9:30.  had to wait 15 min. for a table, not bad.  got called for the table at 9:28am.  went to the hostess stand and without saying hi the commandant said \"if your other party is not here I will need to put you back on the list\"  I said he is in the parking lot, he just txted me.  \"I cannot seat you and will need to put you back on the list to wait for a table\"  wow, I was blown away.  there is nothing about this place that is worth waiting for, let alone to be treated like that. this goofy accent rude hostess needs to learn some manners.  The owners need to get a clue.  There are plenty of awesome places for breakfast but this is not one of them. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Crowded but worth the hour long wait for breakfast. My favorite was the cheese grits (which they offer as a substitute for breakfast potatoes). The red chile sauce was also a favorite.   The ambiance is loud and crowded but I am willing to overlook for their great food."}
{"text":"This is how you do breakfast! Fresh brewed coffee, freshly squeezed orange juice, pancakes, eggs Benedict, corn beef hash, bacon and home fries, all superb. A must stop if in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Fluffy omelette, great pancakes! Nice decor, friendly service! Great breakfast place!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Great outdoor seating and great options for breakfast. Everything tasted so good!"}
{"text":"The bestest place for breakfast! The Irish Egg Benny and Florentine Benny are one of the best egg Benedict we have had in US and Asia. There is always a long queue but with the pager system, it's ok to wait out the 10-15mins, and the food is certainly worth the wait!"}
{"text":"As a visitor to the Scottsdale area, this was my first time at Butters. I chose this spot based on the great reviews from other yelpers. This place not only met, but exceeded all my expectations!  I read that the wait time to be seated can often be lengthy, but it only took 15 minutes to get seated. The waitress was extremely attentive and checked on us frequently during our meal to make sure everything was going great.   I ordered the Classic Benny with hash browns and it came within minutes! The service was sooooo fast. Better than almost any restaurant I've ever been too. The portion sizing for the Classic Benny was perfect. Big enough to get you full, but not a sickening amount.  My husband also ordered a glass of fresh squeezed orange juice. It was about $4 for a small glass, but it was actually worth it!   If you're looking for a filling, fast, and delicious breakfast/brunch, I highly recommend Butters. Next time I go back I'm definitely going to try some of their decadent pancakes!!"}
{"text":"On a Sunday afternoon before the long drive back to Tucson, we wanted to have what sounded from others, like a good place along the way to stop for pancakes.  I wanted a waffle.  My husband and I used our GPS to find this restaurant, easy to find, we pulled in, appreciating being able to make a right turn for a change.  Upon entrance, we were initially dismayed to see about 20 people lined up outside, after a half hour wait, we were seated at a booth.  The noise volume of conversations and pop-music require hearing impaired to use sign language to communicate.  It's a fast-paced place.  One of the owners present could not believe we came up from Tucson to eat here because we haven't found anything in Tucson that can compete with this restaurant.  The delicate Belgian waffle and FRESH strawberries and turkey bacon was a sure pleaser.  Modest in price, this place commands a return visit for more of the same, fresh ingredients, an eclectic menu and pancakes and waffles that don't taste like they are out of a Safeway mix box."}
{"text":"These guys were AWESOME! Great service.. Great food. I NEVER finish hashbrowns.. and they didn't saturate theirs in grease.. ugh! Just fantastic place. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Worth the wait! Definitely get a specialty pancake, they are totally worth it! The cinnamon roll pancake was AMAZING! All the food we ordered was tasty and the service was extremely wonderful. Our server had a great big smile, was very thorough checking on us, making sure we were happy and well fed, and well taken care of! The ambiance is nothing special but the food, is so delicious!"}
{"text":"Awesome everything!!! Actual fresh squeezed OJ, pancakes amazing and light (fresh strawberries inside), egg white omelet with fresh veggies cooked perfectly. And the \"hash browns\" are insane! Super impressed! Will come back often, for sure."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Scottsdale! Omg! I had a whole hog skillet with scrambled cheese eggs, my brother had the same with a sunny side egg. My sister had wild berry bliss toast. Also ordered the biscuits and gravy with a side of cheese grits. Ordered so much to sample due to the amazing delicious looking images provided by Yelpers. We spent about 65 bucks including tip. Well worth it."}
{"text":"Made the mistake of eating breakfast out on a Saturday. Morning....quite a long wait in the heat. Quite a small table for 2, crammed in. OJ was fresh squeezed as promised, was 20 more minutes before our pancakes and eggs arrived, nothing out of the ordinary, coffees ok. Have had better elsewhere."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast joint in Phoenix, hands down!  I don't usually like omelettes but the omelettes here were amazing. Pancakes were awesome, service was great, and the whole family loved it. We will be back many times in the near future!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit---and our last! All 5 of us ordered lunch. Chicken salad sandwich, mediocre , French dip , average. Biltmore chicken sandwich , no flavor, unless you count the paper from the cheese which was inadvertently  left on the sandwich! The waitress said \"oh sorry \"! Later we asked for the manager and told him about the paper. His reply was \"oh, I heard about that\". I feel he should have come over as soon as he was told by the waitress and apologized. He did offer to remake it, (too little, too late). They finally did remove it from the bill . Not looking for a free lunch, just a good one."}
{"text":"Wait took over 50min,  manager was a unprofessional, food not special -  Pancakes came out cold and hard  over rated in my opinion Cracker & Co far superior"}
{"text":"Like sweet? Get anything Berry Bliss-style (best pancakes ever). Feeling savory? They've got that covered too - try the Eggs Verde, which resembles an inside-out, breakfast quesadilla, just don't forget the chorizo!  Real, fresh-squeezed juices are a must out on the sunny patio. Outstanding."}
{"text":"Exactly what you want out of a traditional American breakfast restaurant. I've been here roughly 20 times. Probably more actually. The food is consistently the same great quality.  If you want to avoid a wait, get here as early as you can. Before 8, you can generally grab a table and a quick pre-work breakfast before the crowd really picks up.  As far as the food itself: omelettes, scrambles, and pancakes are all excellent. The protein pancakes are my go to side with my eggs. Coffee is fine here but if you're willing to drink your coffee before or after the meal you have Village Coffee a couple steps away and they are true experts in this area."}
{"text":"This place is soo good! We go every Sunday and despite the fact there is always a 20-40 min wait it's worth it! They serve Gluten free pancakes and they are amazing! Nothing is too greasy either which I appreciate. My favorite is the New Mexico skillet with the chocolate chip gluten free pancakes - yummy! Honestly one if the best breakfast places on Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This is an exceptional place for breakfast. Very good quality, lots of delicious choices, great fresh orange juice, and a friendly staff. Be prepared to wait for a table, specially on the weekends. It's worth the wait! Heather is an awesome waitperson and we love sitting in her section!"}
{"text":"this is becoming my GO TO breakfast spot.   I have been here about 10 times now and I am convinced there is nothing bad on the menu. I cannot wait for the weather to break and enjoy that patio again.   They have breakfast down like APPLE has smartphones down!"}
{"text":"I really have enjoyed the food I have had here which includes the gluten free waffle and a few entree salads. I wish they would incorporate more gluten free items to their menu like gluten free bread for sandwiches and more GF sauces/dressings. This place is what I call a half a** gluten free restaurant it really has a minimal gluten free menu. I was disappointed that all I can order here is a few breakfast items and salads. I have Celiacs diesease so its hard for me to find places I can eat out.   I asked on two separate occasions if the salad dressing (which are all homemade btw) are gluten free. On the first occasion I was told yes they are safe for me to eat and all are made in house and gluten free on one visit . On my next visit I was told non of the salad dressings are gluten free and oil and vinegar was my only option. For being a gluten free restaurant the service staff and chefs are not well trained and have no knowledge on what is safe for people who come here for the gluten free options. I wasn't impressed that the two different chef's lack of knowledge and that service staff had no idea also what was in most of the dressings and sauces. I waitresses for years and I was always trained on the  ingredients in all of the menu items and I worked at a very basic restaurant that did not have any GF options. I expect more of a knowledge base about the food from the staff at a place like Butters. I will only order the GF Waffle or GF Pancakes from now on as I don't think I am safe trusting the word of the employees on items that are not specified as being gluten free on the menu. This place needs to train their staff better and for that reason I couldn't give it five stars. Great food and atmosphere though!"}
{"text":"I have been to Butters twice now and both of my experiences were about the same.  The service was pretty bad both times and both times they messed up my order.  I had them remake it the first time and it was pretty good.  The second time I enjoyed what they brought me even though it wasn't what i ordered.  This would be a great place with better service."}
{"text":"BEST BREAKFAST/BRUNCH PLACE EVERRRR!!! Came here for my fiancé's and I's anniversary for the first time and we went back two days in a row!! I raved about it to my family and co workers! We are going to be returning!!! The only complaint is how crowded it gets inside we sat outside both times lucky it wasn't too warm or humid out! There is a lot more breathing outside for sure in my opinion because they tried to sit us inside and right away we felt like we were sitting on top of people or would get bumped by a plate or a person. It is a very cute place otherwise and the food!!!....well you have to try it for yourself because there are almost no words! Each waitress we had were very kind and considerate of what we were requesting when ordering! They kept up on our refills and made sure everything was just how we wanted it!"}
{"text":"The best breakfast I've eaten in my life!!! Without a doubt enjoyed every bite of my meal! It usually takes me a lot to shut up at any point in life but not a word came out of me during the whole meal till the VERY LAST BITE!! Serious was incredible, fast and friendly! For 9 people the prices were more than reasonable! And excellent service requires a amazing tip which I was more than happy to give with how satisfied I was eating here!!!!!"}
{"text":"\"American Breakfast Staple Done Right\"  Skillet corned beef hash is delicious.  Belgium waffles cooked with perfect combination of crispy outside with moist center topped off with there signature \"Butters\" syrup.  It is clear why there is always a long wait on weekends.  Our waitress very cordial and aware of her table and cleanliness of the table.  There was little spillage from our orange juice and she quickly alerted another wait staff to help clean our table.  She came to check on us twice.  (Once is considered standard).  The decor is Clean and modern and impressive.  On a first impression Butters delivers a strong showing on what is basic of American breakfast staple.  I would have to go again to check on consistency."}
{"text":"Butter's is a trick. I have no idea how they have such a high rating with so many other excellent breakfast places competing with them.  The syrup was repulsive. It was in a glass maple syrup bottle, but was low grade corn syrup mixed with maple flavor.   My cheese omelette tasted like fish. I feel sick just thinking about it."}
{"text":"Great Breakfast! If you need a hearty meal or something light Butters has it! Highly recommend the Skillet if you're trying to start your morning off right.. Only negative is parking gets a little tight because of the busy shopping center."}
{"text":"$9 for tasty hash browns, 3 sausage links, 2 eggs over easy and 2 fluffy pancakes...mmmmmmmmmmm"}
{"text":"Mexican omelet was amazing.. the additional cake option was very unique. Service was very friendly.. and worth the 30 minute wait on a Sunday morning. We visited the older location which was a bit dated, but cozy. The newer location may have a different vibe."}
{"text":"Amazing find!!! Great freshly squeezed OJ the wild berry crepe was delicious and the skillet eggs dishes are amazing. The wait time is a bit of a bummer but worth it for sure if you have the time. A total local hangout not touristy and we loved that about it you get the real vibe of the people and everyone was great the service is fast and the food is great all around you can't go wrong... We totally found our new breakfast place when in Scottsdale Arizona we stayed at the Omni resort and the drive up there was not bad at all about 13 minutes or so. Prices are fair and portions are great much better then anything you will get at the hotel at double the price if you don't mind taking a quick ride, highly recommended don't let the wait scare you it moves pretty fast... Try it you will love it"}
{"text":"Butters is a must-try for breakfast in Scottsdale. The staff is friendly and really efficient and the food is amazing."}
{"text":"This review isn't so much for the food, which was honestly very good, probably 4 stars.  The two stars is for the service.  The server was fine, impersonally nice, but we had no issues with her whatsoever, she did everything she was supposed to the entire time and I would give her a solid 4 stars for her performance.  The problem came up when my husband asked no less than 4 people walking around with coffee if he could have some cream. Each one said yes, then left, never to return with cream, nor did our server arrive with it.  He waited several minutes and then went in search of some cream.  Still, no real problem. When the manager came over to talk to him about it my husband made some suggestions about how it might be more efficient (he's an engineer and so tends to look for ways to improve systems efficiency) and the manager seemed to get \"affably belligerent\".  It was uncomfortable. I tried to placate him by saying we were not attacking the restaurant or him, but he proceeded to tell us how the restaurant is the top in the state and it was impossible that we experienced what we did.  We both felt he was telling us in a round about way that we must be lying.  He insisted that it was impossible and was challenging when I mentioned that I have had issues every time I have visited.  I am guessing to be fair that lots of people have not had issues there and this is just \"bad luck\" on my part but the way he handled it made us feel bullied and like he was telling us that there was something was wrong with us expressing our experience.  He asked me about my other experiences and when I explained what had happened he repeatedly asked which server I had had, which honestly, made me a little nervous for her since he made it sound like he was going to discipline her.  He also told me my previous experience was \"impossible\" several times, very loudly, shaking his head.  I waited tables for several years in college and never saw a manager act this way towards patrons.  He trotted out that they have served high rollers and famous people, as if that invalidated our version of things.  He was very indignant about our experience and seemed to blame it on us until the very end of the conversation.  It was kind of scary.  He proceeded to verbally slam the other breakfast restaurants around, places we have not had any problems with and have gone to much more frequently.  He trash talked their kitchens and service.  I know that no place is 100%, but in one week there were two service gaps, not big ones, but noticeable to someone who has worked in the food service industry.  My husband and I both tried to represent our true experiences regarding the other places and to be respectful of what they are trying to do there, but we finished off feeling like we were told that more important people eat there and they were satisfied, so we were lying.  It was honestly astounding.   I guess what I would say is that if you have never had problems there, keep on keeping on because the food is good.  Even though the manager told me to tell them if anything is amiss, I would probably not do it again.  I have never felt so berated in a restaurant before.  I went to Oink (one of the places he was discussing negatively) last week and had a small issue with my meal, the server apologized profusely, took it away, had a new one rushed out and then charged me nothing.  No fuss, no muss, and that was a big issue.  This was a mountain made out of a molehill.  A simple, \"I am so sorry you had to come for your own cream\" would have done wonders and even if he didn't like my husband's idea about how to fix that small inefficiency a simple \"Yes, we will check into that, thank you\" would have covered it and maybe we would have felt comfortable eating there again.  I did leave my name and email there, but in all honesty the though of eating there again makes me anxious, we felt belittled and attacked and all we went there for was a relaxing breakfast."}
{"text":"Everything about our breakfast experience here was phenomenal. The service was great, all of our dishes were beyond expectation (highly recommend the corned beef skillet), the orange juice was freshly squeezed, and the atmosphere welcoming. So worth it!"}
{"text":"You know that any place named 'Butters' is gonna be good.   There can be a long wait on weekends,but it is SO worth it. The menu is what you would expect, but the serving sizes are generous, the food comes quick and everything is delicious.   The fried egg sandwich is a family favorite, as are the blueberry pancakes (gluten free!) and the wildberry crepes were mouth watering. Worth the wait, and lives up to it's delicious name :)."}
{"text":"The food has always been consistent when we come here. Best of all, it gets to you fast, hot, fresh AND CORRECT. I am always amazed when we go, sit down and order, how quickly my order gets to my table. Great place."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and the servers the best! Our only complaint is that Danny, the GM, is arbitrary, inconsiderate and downright rude. Enjoyed the fresh squeezed OJ a real weakness of mine. Yummy! The skillets and corned beef hash were very good too. Don't know about the pancakes. Only 2 flavors of jam thought that was a little odd. I will return and just ignore Danny."}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoy venturing out of the house on the weekend for breakfast.  From a prior Yelp review, we decided to give Butters a try.  We are very glad we did as everything met or exceeded our expectations, from being seated, the service, how prompt they were, politeness, and how delicious the food.    As we were leaving my wife made a comment that we must come back sooner than later as she wanted to try other items on the menu.  All in all we are going back there next weekend.    Cheers!"}
{"text":"Great meal! Would recommend to anyone for an awesome breakfast. If you get a chance to try the Whole Pig skillet with Pecan pancakes you will not be disappointed. Perfect for breakfast or lunch!"}
{"text":"Wow.  We were seated immediately. The menu had everything I could want, except for mimosas.  Plenty of upgrade options available.  I built my own omelet, my wife had a scramble and we shared the protein power pancakes and a fruit plate.  The portions were ample, and everything tasted great.  Coffees refilled swiftly, and the servers did a great job.  Wished I lived in the area!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice so far.   Wait Time: If you want to sit outside, you'll be seated right away. If you want to sit inside, it's a long wait. I've also noticed that parties listed below ours were seated before us, which didn't make sense. We got really peeved about that.   Ambiance: Outside is way too hot during the summer. Inside is very loud and table are close together.   Service: Our waitress the first time around was average. The second time we came, our waitress was energetic and made the long 50 minute wait worth while.   Food: I recommend getting a skillet and getting a premium pancake as a side. The prices are fairly priced, considering the amount of food you get. The pancakes are soft and made with butter. The oreo s'mores is definitely a sweet tooth. The butter cream is also good. Overall, anything on the menu is great. The food is the true reason we'll keep coming back.   Overall, I would give a 5-star rating, but the wait time for sitting inside is way too long."}
{"text":"This is about food and service. I called ahead to order a turkey burger and sweet potato fries for pick up. Over the phone they told me 5-10 minutes and I gave them the 10 minutes before showing up. I had to wait an additional 15 minutes upon arrival. Although the girl at the register was nice and apologized for the wait, it was so inconvenient for my 30 minute lunch break. Not alone was it bad enough for the wait, the fries were very under cooked. Highly disappointed. Not going back there again."}
{"text":"What can I say? This place hits the hangry button inside my stomach somewhere every single time!  The venue is a bit small and lines are always out the door. I do not mind waiting for those delicious Wildberry pancakes smothered with marscarpone cheese. The wait is usually not too bad...average 25 minutes every time. The staff are super duper friendly and very accommodating.    The service is incredible! The minute that you place your order, you will receive your food within 10-15 minutes! The ingredients are all fresh and clean!!! What do I mean by clean? No gooey substitutes for fruits, always fresh fruits and veg! What can I say? I absolutely love this place....I have been here 3 Saturday's in a row and the food is always consistent when it comes to taste!! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"If your looking for a brunch spot this place is AMAZING!!!!!! I don't say amazing too often so when I do it must be amazing.  Pancake was fantastic, orange juice was freshly squeezed...service was wonderful and will come back to this place in a heartbeat.."}
{"text":"All I have to say is this is hands-down, bar-none, the best breakfast I have ever tasted in my life--no joke. In fact, after dining there yesterday morning, I had to stop the restaurant manager to let him know how impressed I was with the entire Butters experience. I am from Toronto and was visiting Arizona this past weekend. Since breakfast is my favourite! meal of the day, I was searching for the perfect spot in Arizona, and thank goodness I found it! Let me break down what I love about Butters:  Food: Pancakes and orange juice, pancakes and orange juice, oh my goodness can I say that ten times. I cannot describe into words how amazing these two items are on the menu--and this is coming from a girl who loooooves pancakes and has been on the hunt for years for the best pancakes. Well, thanks to Butters I finally found it. They are light, fluffy, and literally mouth-watering. The orange juice comes out of this really cool machine and the taste is like nothing you've ever had! fresh, sweet, amazing!  Service: All of the staff was so attentive and professional. Not annoying or pretentious. The food was served quickly and came out hot and wonderful!  Atmosphere: The place is really chic, but warm and inviting. I went with my family, but Butters would also be the perfect date spot, or a spot to hang out with friends for brunch on a Saturday or Sunday.  Overall, I can't wait to go back to Butters on my next trip to Arizona!"}
{"text":"This place is my favorite!  All there food is amazing. My favorite  are the BIG fluffy omelets! Waiters are on point."}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service.  Everything on the menu is fantastic"}
{"text":"I went here on a very busy morning and I had to return my food because it was cold.  I ordered the corned beef hash skillet and it was undercooked.  I have ordered this several times in the past and it was always excellent.  I think it was just because it was a very busy morning and the kitchen was rushing.  In any event, I will definitely go here again (maybe when it isn't so crowded and definitely NOT during spring training)."}
{"text":"Regardless of the time or day. I'm constantly amazed of the speed of service.  The food is consistently great."}
{"text":"Good food and service nice location,a little put off by not being able to mix couple of pancakes without being charged seperatley for each one. The size of cakes also kind of small for price of 7.95 for 3 protein cakes."}
{"text":"Went here with my grandchildren and they had Oreo Pancakes and absolutely loved it. Service was great, and there is a good atmosphere."}
{"text":"A friend visiting needed to be taken to a special place for Brunch. Yelp suggested Butters and was not wrong. It is a very good place to enjoy a long, lazy brunch facing the fountains (if you are lucky). However, long is the key word here. The wait is quite long on weekends and they don't take reservations beforehand. Pity the mall it is located in doesn't have much to kill time in (everything else is also an eating joint!) but the fountain made for some good backdrop for taking selfies.. :)  On the food, we ordered the Garden skillet, Egss Rojo/Verde and the buttermilk pancakes. The pancakes win hands down, the best I have had. The other two are decent but not the best I have had. Do go for a long lazy brunch and have sufficient time to go take a nap afterwards."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this place five times before writing this review.  The omelettes sit in water/egg juice and the coffee is some of the worst I have ever had.  It is so acidic you will need to drink eight glasses of water to counterbalance one cup.  AVOID.  FOLLOW UP REVIEW: They have since changed their coffee and their pancake recipe.  I can't but somewhat feel like I had influence.  The place is good and the portions are huge."}
{"text":"I love BUTTERS!...(and I hate breakfast!)  I've been to Scottsdale twice, and went to Butters twice.  That sums up how much i love this place.  They have great fresh orange juice!  They refill their syrup for every table as soon as the customers leave...everyone loves a full jar of syrup!  It's the little things that make me happy! :)  It's quite popular among the locals, the second time I had to wait 30 minutes for a table.  But it's worth it.  Go here!"}
{"text":"Meh, it's ok. Eggs were sub-par, corn beef hash was out of the can, bacon was chewy and cold. Pancakes were pretty good, but you can find similar quality at other places. Service was extremely quick but server was a bit disconnected. All in all, i'd pass."}
{"text":"Food is always consistent in size, quality and taste. One can taste the freshness in the omelettes and skillets. Large portions for the price and quick service...once you are in. Get ready for a 30-50 min wait on busy days. Same at Butterfield's (sister restaurant)"}
{"text":"Decent breakfast spot with slightly above average food.  Service was very good."}
{"text":"Very good breakfast menu with some unique interpretations of traditional breakfast items. The only knock is the wait time because of the small venue. But the food is worth the wait!!"}
{"text":"Came here on Sunday for brunch with my boyfriend for the first time and I can't wait to visit this place again food was delicious especially their pancakes"}
{"text":"Great pancakes, breakfast and lunch. Lots of options. The coffee keeps coming. Long wait on the weekends, but worth the wait. Enjoyable experience, friendly staff. Did i mention great pancakes. If you are not looking for an entire pancake breakfast, you can add a speciality pancake to most breakfast orders."}
{"text":"Amazing banana cream pancakes! Skillet was the best I've had. Crazy busy but worth the wait!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Cinnamon roll and pecan pancakes were delicious, the cappuccino was better than Starbucks! Get one to go!"}
{"text":"Great food nice selections had the skillet with strawberry pancakes delicious... Our server was sweet and pleasant. We will definitely be back. Wanted to try something new and Butter hit the mark"}
{"text":"Horrible experience with the girls up front who greet you.. we usually go tot he one on north sight and it's much better service there.. I will not come to the via de Ventura location, awful treatment.. rude and careless.. figure I point this out for others!"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed with customer service. Because of the lack of parking at this location the adolescent hostess gave away our party of five table. She then wanted us to wait another 15 minutes. If you like cattle call, this is your place."}
{"text":"Best breakfast ever.  Every item on the menu is fresh, hot and tasty.   So why four stars? I've eaten there more than 100 times over the past three years.  It's the long wait to get a table.  Butters continues to thrive in popularity.  Good for them.  Bad for regulars.  Tables are turned quickly . .  .  I understand the business side - I get it.  That's why I know I have to show up early to avoid the 40 plus minute wait."}
{"text":"Second time eating here with hubby and I love it. Had the Mexican skillet and pecan pancakes. Mexican skillet had great ingredients and oh so fluffy eggs. Had crunchy scallop sliced potatoes which added a nice crunch to the skillet. Pancakes were fluffy. Felt like I was eating pillow cakes with syrup. Yummy yummy!!! Nom Nom!!! Recommend getting there early in the morning like we did since it gets busy really quickly!!"}
{"text":"Wanting to try something new, Mr. B. and I stumbled upon this spot. Well, actually it's been on my bookmark list for a while now but that's besides the point.  The service was good. Our waitress was attentive however, it would be great if she would've been more suggestive of the menu items. There are so many awesome options on the menu that it was hard to make a choice. Especially after confirming that we'd never been there before. We waited about 30 mins for a table and opted to walk the perimeter to check out the shops in the area. But, once we were seated and ordered our food, the order came rather promptly and was served hot.  The food was Grreeat! It was in abundance and extremely flavorful. I opted for 2 scrambled eggs (more like 4 but, NOT complaining), potatoes (gotta try), bacon, and sub'd my toast for pecan pancakes ($.99 up charge but damn sure worth it!). Mr. B. had Swedish pancakes with bananas, pecans and some other additions that he felt necessary. Although I don't care for all the extras on my cakes, I found them very tasty (thin, and crisp with the right amount of sweetness).  We didn't mind the wait (we expect it in most places we frequent) and will definitely be back....several times.   A must try!"}
{"text":"Hostess were extremely rude when i received my pancakes they were cold with hardly any powdered sugar, i honestly expected better quality for the price i payed. Also in a previous occasion the egg benedict i ordered was hard when i asked for runny my hashbrown was raw at the bottom as well. Worst experience ive had so far i even heard a manager named daniel curse loudly i find this very unprofessional for any restaurant, i wouldnt recommend nor go back and waste my money in this place once again."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot. Cafe is perfect for when they have wait. I ordered the Baked Potato Omelet with a cinnamon role pancake. Amazing!"}
{"text":"This place has great food and great service. So good we came here multiple times on vacation. Will definitely make it one of my first stops next time I come back."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and each time I am more satisfied than the last. I went with a few out of town relatives this morning and they raved about the breakfast they had. The fresh squeezed orange juice and multiberry pancakes were amazing. Thank you"}
{"text":"Very good breakfast. Loved the stacked pancakes stuffed with marscapone. Very generously sized omelletes.   But alas be prepared for a wait. Min 20 minutes on Sundays, if you come after 1 it isn't as bad."}
{"text":"Best eggs ever. Pancakes were delicious too. Quick, friendly service. Wish we could call-in to save a table. Waiting in the cramped lobby was no bueno."}
{"text":"It's hard to find great homemade food with a non-pretentious vibe where you wouldn't be self-conscience for bringing your kids along.  Butters has done it! The Hog skillet was amazing.  The fresh squeezed orange juice as good as it gets.  This place is over the top awesome."}
{"text":"Not a bad spot, but every once in awhile a snooty teenage hostess or waitress will dampen the mood. There's nothing like someone barking \"May I help you?\" as if they think you're deaf when you make the mistake of approaching the hostess stand and interrupt the conversation they're having with a co-worker.  Or the waitress who asks if there's anything else you need while the food is STILL being served - yet gets annoyed when you call them over to let them know that the middle of your pancakes are uncooked.  Usually the food is good, but it's breakfast, right?  There are so many other places that can make pancakes, and without 30-40 minute wait for dry customer service. I give 3 stars and not just 2 because I've been there about 5-6 times, and they have hit more than they've missed, but the misses mean I will let some time pass before I feel like visiting them again."}
{"text":"Great new location for Butters. I love the waffles and eggs. Nice patio and trendy urban farmhouse decor.   Looking forward to another visit"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum. I went here during the week after 10 and there was still a 15 minute wait! But it was well worth it!! Butters is in fact owned by the same people as Butterfields. I was not sure if it was until I looked on the Butterfields website. Butterfields is good but Butters is better!!! I had the Wildberry (Blueberry) Pancakes. They came with a ton of fruit which was really good to eat the pancakes with. I also tried the hashbrowns and while I would not call them hashbrowns they were still really good!! They were cut the shape of scalloped potatoes (round) but were thin and fried nicely to have a crunch.. Mmm overall a really good place!! Also, the portions are pretty big."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Butters 3 times now.  The food has always been delish and the staff have been stellar!  However, on my recent visit I was very disappointed when the male manager called out one of his female staff in the middle of the dining room.    I don't need to know that some guy called asking for her and that apparently they will only accept emergency phone calls while they are working!  Not only do I not care to hear about their personal policy, but I also don't feel like having that feeling of dread while trying to enjoy my breakfast.  I am sure this particular female staff member was feeling the exact same at that moment since I was the only one in the whole dining room at that time and I made it very apparent that I was listening to their conversation with disgust.  Not only did I want to come to her defense, but I was also fighting that overwhelming urge to tell that jerk of a boss to go kick rocks.  For a very brief moment, I thought John Quinonez was going to come out of kitchen and surprise me with a face full of cameras!  When is it ever appropriate to front off your staff in front of your guests?  Never!  And it always seems to be the male management committing these crimes.  The days of female bashing are gone.  As I've always said, \"Praise in public, punish in private!\"  Chance are real good I will not be returning to Butters and I hope that poor female staff member finds another restaurant to full fill her goals and hopefully she will be under more professional management.  Better yet, I  hope she becomes his manager some day and fires his unprofessional male chauvinistic ass!"}
{"text":"The food was good, the pancakes and the orange juice was the best things they had. I really enjoyed the restaurant setting. The crepes were bland and the Canadian bacon was salty, so I would stay away from them two. I had the cinnamon roll pancake with my corn beef hash and they were both very good. Would definitely recommend this place for others."}
{"text":"Butters is my very favorite restaurant for breakfast and lunch. It is a very efficient operation with really great service by great people. Everything I've had there has been very good and I would recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"Ate here during a staycation and was worried that my expectations were too high. They weren't. This place is WORTH THE HYPE. Our party of 4 was seated in 20 minutes on a Sunday morning (9:30 am). I'm not sure if we just got lucky, or what. The OJ is amazing (you can see them making it at the coffee bar) and all of our egg dishes were fluffy and delicious. The hashbrowns were cooked like scallop country-style homefries...BOMB.   You can tell the servers understand how in-demand this place is and are on top of their game.   I will absolutely come back!"}
{"text":"I'm just passing through but from the limited experience I've had, the food is excellent.  I chose the Mexicana omelet. It came with a side of pancakes and hash browns. I couldn't finish it all.   My waitress was professional and attentive. Well done."}
{"text":"While I have been a longtime fan of Butterfield's, this new outpost with a similar name is my new favorite because it is closer to my house!  The menu is about the same as Butterfield's, but that is a good thing, because I have never tried something that I didn't like!  Lately I have been a big fan of the Popeye Scramble, with onions, bacon, spinach and jack cheese...it is divine.  The hash browns are crispy and I can never decide between the thick sourdough toast or the melt in your mouth pancakes!  Yesterday the pancakes were the winner, and they were delicious as usual, my favorite pancakes in town!  We did have to wait about 30 mintues on a Sunday morning to be seated, but that is on par with all the other good breakfast places in the area.  But Butter's makes up the time by getting the food out fast!  I spoke to the owner and apparently any new locations that they open are going to be in the Butter's name....but who cares what the name is as long as the food is good!"}
{"text":"The freshly squeezed OJ is the best thing here. The breakfast was good but nothing too special. However, I did not have one of the specialty pancakes which i guess they are known for. Quick service."}
{"text":"Great spot for a big breakfast. Had the Classic Eggs Benedict which was very good and came with a pretty healthy helping of potatoes. Prices were very reasonable for the size of the plates and the service here was great and they are pretty fast. Even at 9:30 on a weekday though there was a small line out the door when I left."}
{"text":"This place is the best bkfast spot in AZ! It's become the only place we will go. Service is always impressive & food is amazing. Oreo pancakes, cinnamon roll pancakes & country Benedict are my go-to's."}
{"text":"I was looking for a gluten-free friendly place and they have pancakes and waffles and even gluten-free oatmeal! I got their pancakes and they were delicious and so filling! The fresh squeezed orange juice was delicious, no pulp. My husband got the cinnamon roll pancakes and they were also excellent."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried Butters for the first time yesterday. We both thoroughly enjoyed it. The wait at 11:00 on Saturday was about 30 minutes. We waited outside in the heat, when it is over 100* it's uncomfortable.  Just before our buzzer went off I noticed people getting their buzzer and then heading to the coffee joint a couple doors down. Note to self for my next visit.   We had coffee with fresh cream, amazed at the fresh cream. I thought the decaf was Very good. Not bitter at all. Husband ordered OJ and raved about it. He insisted I try his, and then I ordered one for myself. I would say that was the best OJ we've ever had.   What to order... There is such variety in the menu that it was difficult to choose. I went with the corned beef skillet and pancakes. Yum!! The pancakes were nice and light. Oh so good! The corned beef was a bit sparse in the dish, but it was still very good. Butters owners must have listened to previous Yelpers and updated the hash browns, we loved the very thin cut and browned potatoes.  Husband ordered the usual eggs, bacon, English muffin and hash brown. He enjoyed it all. His over hard eggs were cooked to perfection for him. We also shared the apple crepes. Heaven on earth! Never having had crepes before, I am hooked! Husband is a crepe lover and said these were the fluffiest he's ever had. I can't wait to go back and try the banana and Nutella version. It will have to be soon.   About the service...it was decent. Nothing spectacular. The waitress really didn't have much personality. However, she tended to our needs very well.   Something I thought was odd. They give you the bill without a check folder  and you are to pay your server. So we had to lay out a $100 that we wanted to break. I don't know why that bothers me. But I don't think I would want my credit card laying out either. Again, just something minor."}
{"text":"Love this place they have the best omelettes in the valley and being gluten free they have so many accommodations!"}
{"text":"Butters is an excellent place to have breakfast or lunch. I love that they have such a wide variety of gluten free items. Thank you butters will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"1st time there over the weekend for breakfast. Service was great, food was out exceptionally fast and the order was correct. The food was FANTASTIC! Try it and you'll be happy you did."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast, nice outdoor seating and something for everyone on the menu. Large portions, enough to share. Excellent food, clean & very professional, friendly staff."}
{"text":"Having read the reviews prior to coming we were well aware there would be a wait. In addition we had a group of 6 so we expected the wait to be awhile. We arrived shortly before 11am on a sunday and were told that the wait would be 45 minutes. We had a nice chat outside and were seated just before 1130.   Previous reviewers mentioned the coffee was the best they'd every had so i ordered the coffee. The coffee was good but my cup was only refilled once and sat empty for a little bit.   I ordered the New Mexico Skillet after being scared away from the omelttes( saw one delivered to a nearby table and while it looked delicious the thing was huge. I could not have eaten it by myself). Food was delivered quicker than we expected and was definitely some of the better breakfast food I've had in a while. Most dishes were very reasonably priced.   We'll probably come back but it will likely be a while. Other breakfast places are close to as good and often have shorter wait times."}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews, but when I run across a place this good, I like to let people know. I live in the area and had been wanting to try this place since it opened and boy I was not disappointed. I started with the fresh squeezed orange juice and you can immediately tell that it's actually fresh squeezed, amazingly tasty. I ordered the Irish Eggs Benedict that came with corned beef hash and potatoes, with a side of applewood smoked bacon. From the first bite you can taste the quality and freshness of the ingredients, wow! The staff there is fantastic, very friendly, attentive and quick with the refills and anything you need. I will definitely be coming back and trying other things on the menu. A lot of restaurants come and go quickly but this place looks like it's hit on a winning formula, I think it'll be here to stay."}
{"text":"Everything that everyone has said.  OJ--a must! Everything we had there was great.  The veggie omelet was basic pretty basic.  The pancakes, Mexican skillet thing (forgot the name) hog omelet...even the milk was ice cold and good.  We waited 15 min on a Friday at 11:00am we will be going back."}
{"text":"This place used to be amazing: great, very consistent food in pleasant surroundings. Have been going there once or twice a week since it opened. However, things have changed in the past few months. Very rude hostesses and a manager that seems clueless. Worst part is the bathrooms. Several of the last few times I've been there they had no toilet paper or paper towel and the place was a mess. One lady commented that it looked like the aftermath of a frat party. Worst thing was, we told the staff and they could not have cared less. If the bathrooms looks like this I can't imagine what the kitchen is like! Sad to see it go downhill because it was one of my favorite places to go... But I'm done!"}
{"text":"We had to wait for our table as this place seems to be pretty popular. We also had to wait for some jerk who got there 15 min after us, with a smaller party, and insisted on seating in the table they were preparing for us, and finally left throwing a tantrum because they wanted to seat him and his party of 4 at a table for 4... Some people.  Anyway, the wait was well worth it. The service was super friendly and fast. The food was delicious. I had a Mexican omelette that was perfectly cooked. Really, perfectly. My wife said their orange juice was super fresh and the best she has had in a long time. The kids had pancakes and waffles they devoured. If we ever visit the Scottsdale area we will definitely go there for breakfast again."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in town.  We have been there many time and enjoy it every time.. They take their eggs and put them through a blender making their omelettes fluffy."}
{"text":"Great place with super-fast & friendly service & plenty of great options (including gluten free).   We headed here on a Saturday morning for breakfast and as all the other reviews note, it was packed, and there were several people waiting for a table, especially since everyone was requesting indoor seating due to the chilly morning. Don't be turned off by this. Despite the wait we were seated in less than 10 minutes (what we were quoted) and after we ordered our food, it was out in less than 10 minutes.  Gluten free eaters, you are in luck. Choose from a variety of skillets, omelets, and egg scrambles as well as gluten free pancakes or gluten free Belgian waffles! I ordered the New Mexico skillet and chose the gluten free pancakes and a cup of fruit as sides. I was pleasantly surprised that there was no up-charge for the two GF pancakes as other places usually tack on at least $2 extra! Pancakes were really good - not super dry & crumbly as most GF pancakes tend to be and the skillet was spicy and tasty.   This is also a great breakfast option for those that have no dietary restrictions as they can also choose from some unique french toast options, french crepes, breakfast burritos and plenty of oatmeal options.  Service was on point - the minute our plates were done, they were picked up, our waters and coffee were filled like clock-work and this was all done without making us feel rushed at all.   Also, unlike a lot of other places in Scottsdale, this place was unpretentious, plenty of older people, kids, and college students clearly hung over in their pjs - no need to primp for this place. Would definitely stop by here again & try to eat out in the patio!"}
{"text":"Went here on early Sunday with no wait. The waitress split the check for us without us even asking which was kind. The food there is absolutely amazing and I would recommend. Everything on the menu is so delicious but isn't totally affordable. One thing that irked me was that I was charged a dollar for a side of whipped cream.. Really? It was probably worth a penny. Other than that it is great."}
{"text":"There are few places that the portion side is this big and the price so low! The orange juice was incredible; omelet was on point! Would return in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I can't figure out what all the hype is about!  Eveyone just loves this place and while the service is good and the atmosphere OK, depending on where you sit (the patio is quite nice), the food is very mediocre.  I have dined here 3-4 times and each time I want to love the place but just don't.  I do like their Gluten-Free options as it is hard to find good breakfast places with GF choices for my daughter but it is not impossible and this one just doesn't cut it for me.  Why do I think the food is mediocre?  Well, I am picky about my pancakes and like them soft and chewy.  Theirs are very thick and break-like.  Not much different from the ones I make at home with Bisquick.  Their omelets are good but it is not hard to make a good omelet.  They look amazing as they come out very large and puffy but they taste the same as anyone else's and really just depends on your filings.  No complaints about the service, it is not terrible and it is not fantastic, it is just OK.   All in all, just an ok place to dine.  Given that there is ALWAYS a wait, I'll probably pass on this in the future."}
{"text":"No wait, friendly staff, accommodating for my kids menu needs, and having a great menu selection to boot, I have found a jewel of a breakfast place. I would recommend this to anyone whose favorite meal of the day is breakfast."}
{"text":"Buttters never disappoints!! Their food is amazing. They also have fantastic gluten free pancakes and waffles!"}
{"text":"As an off-and-on snow bird I am always looking for new places for breakfast. This is one of the best. Noisy like most but pleasant waitstaff and good food. Be prepared to wait during the holidays."}
{"text":"Butters is absolutely FANTASTIC. I was skeptical about this type of place because it looked like the same old typical bfast spot. Absolutely not. It was AMAZING. I love breakfast burritos so that was on my order with some out of this world grits. I would order it again and again!"}
{"text":"Literally, my favorite restaurant in Scottsdale!  I LOVE this place!  The prices are amazing and the food and service is QUICK!  The ONLY potential drawback is the wait time.  If you come on a Saturday or Sunday morning, expect to wait for at least an hour.  It's worth it, believe me, but you should plan accordingly!"}
{"text":"Once again the Yelpers deliver a winner! My husband devoured the specialty Eggs Verde. Don't skimp on the chorizo here, it makes the meal.  I had corned beef skillet, a perfect balance of egg, meat and potato goodness. It comes with a side of pancakes. Here's the critical tip: upgrade to the banana cream with gram cracker crumb topping for a mere $0.99. We ended up sharing it, although I did eat most of it. Amazing!"}
{"text":"I was in Scottsdale for a few days and found this outstanding restaurant on Yelp!  I was so impressed by the food, service, and atmosphere! I tried the Santa Fe Scrambler an it was awesome!  I originally just ordered coffee,  but I saw someone across the way with an incredible looking glass of OJ, so I ordered a glass.  Most delicious!  They squeeze it fresh.  I will definitely be a return customer!  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place and Butterfield's is the same company so the menu is the same. This time I had the baked potato omelette with the banana cream pancakes. Again it was really good. Definitely enjoyed. The reason I only did 4 stars (may not be fair) is because snooze is by far & away my fav place for pancakes & breakfast. They set the bar of standards for me. Still this place & Butterfield's is very good and you will definitely enjoy it!"}
{"text":"We always enjoy the food at Butters, but it is packed every time we go there and the service is slow. It's the best breakfast option in the neighborhood, but I think they could improve their service."}
{"text":"Very good place. yes waiting was a bit long.The breakfast was excellent, service staff was very professional and efficient.I'm definitely going back"}
{"text":"We're new to the area, and were looking for a good breakfast spot.  We're SOOOO glad we decided to try Butters!  Everything was delicious!  The kids shared the Oreo Cookie S'mores Cakes, which were phenomenal!  There were Oreos IN the pancakes!  I had the Nutella & Strawberries Crepe and a side of Corned Beef Hash.  I would highly recommend Butters.  Looks like we've found our new favorite breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast with large portions. Had Omelette and Pancakes. Very hot very fresh. Great flavor to everything. Service was awesome. Found totally by accident. Will return on next visit."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff! Food arrives very promptly no matter how busy they are. Omelettes are huge and it even includes potatoes and either pancakes, toast, or fruit. Very large servings. Food is good but not outrageously delicious. It's a bit better than most breakfast places in Scottsdale. Only downfall is a wait of at least 30 minutes even really early."}
{"text":"Anyone who knows me can tell you I have the biggest sweet tooth of anyone they have met.  So, when you combine pancakes with chocolate, marshmallow sauce, whip cream, and stuff it with Oreos-you have me beaming with delight!  But wait, not only does Butter's have the most delicious pancakes I have ever had (I ordered the Oreo stuffed s'more pancakes), they also have ginormous omelettes, Nutella stuffed crepes with bananas, waffles with bacon, and fresh squeezed oj.  Yes, I tried them all in one sitting. Yes, they were all as amazing as they sound. Yes, I am in a food coma and happy as can be.  Oh, and the service?  Superb! Everyone had smiles on their faces, was warm and friendly, and highly attentive.    What about the atmosphere? As we speak, I am writing this review on the outdoor patio, overlooking beautiful Scottsdale and a gorgeous fountain, with misters keeping me cool.    5 stars hands down!"}
{"text":"GO HERE FOR BRUNCH.  You will not regret the choice.  It was so good we had to go back the next day.  The skillets are the best I have ever had.  Like the balance of spice, meat, potatoes, and eggs.  They also include two pancakes on the side.  So good.  The coffee and fresh squeezed OJ are great as well.  Worth any wait."}
{"text":"Love  this place!!!  Come hungry and be patient. It's worth the wait.    I frequent Butters thanks to my sister's recommendation. This is by far one of the best breakfast spots in the valley.   My favorites are the omelets. They are fresh and fluffy.  The hash browns are  yummy too. Try the fresh squeezed orange juice. You won't disappointed.   The staff is always friendly and food is phenomenal."}
{"text":"Very nice place the misters outside really helped make it cool. The food was good not very much seasoning but overall it was good."}
{"text":"Three of us had breakfast there. Wide variety of choices for any diner.  We were all very pleased. \"Scramblers\" ingredients very generous, fresh and tasty.  Nice atmosphere. Good service. Finished items removed or refilled immediately."}
{"text":"Our first time at Butters and we loved it!  Definitely worth the wait.  Scrambled eggs are hard to get right and they nailed them.  Delicious, light and fluffy.  They cinnamon roll pancake was incredible and the service was superb.   We will be back!"}
{"text":"This is by far one of my favorite places to have breakfast.  To eat here you must have time to wait. I've always had to wait for a seat.  But the up side is that the food is decently priced and the portions are large enough to share between two.  I'm always trying something different when I visit. The menu has a great selection of choices.  I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I was in town for a few days and OH MY GOODNESS, the food was amazing. It was so good that we had to go twice. The second time there I had the banana cream pancakes......hands down the best I've ever tasted. I don't know the words that even describe the elation I had while eating them; It's just that good. I would have loved to continue eating until I popped but couldn't. If you're in Scottsdale DEFINITELY have breakfast here."}
{"text":"Oh so good.  The service is fast, friendly and efficient.  Our server, Sydney, was fantastic.  the food is really good and cooked to perfection.  I recommend the sweet roll pancakes.  We live out of state but make a point to come here every time we're in town.  Best place for breakfast in AZ."}
{"text":"My wife and I seem to be on the hunt for the perfect breakfast place here in North Scottsdale.  Many to choose from, and Butters is our new favorite.    First of all the atmosphere on the patio was our first hint that we'd like it here.  There is a fountain right off the back and the sounds and smells that make for a pleasant experience.  They were also playing fun music on the patio as well.  Nothing loud or obnoxious, but it was a welcomed addition on a Sunday morning.    Secondly, this is somewhat like a cafe.  They have a barista bar there and the latte my wife got was very tasty and my coffee was very excellent.    Our meals were very good as well.  When it comes to breakfast foods, you don't need to reinvent the wheel.  They served good food, and at a good price and great atmosphere.  We will definitely be back.  **Update** We went back again this Sunday and had another great experience.  The service was awesome and the food was even better.  I went out on a limb and tried something I usually wouldn't get, the Corned Beef Hash Skillet... topped with over easy eggs.  It was amazing.  It also was a lot of food.  I ate about half of it, but I am so glad I tried it."}
{"text":"There's a theory (food-location relativity if you will) that people will almost always think that the food in their hometown is far superior to cuisine in any other location. I think this especially true for Midwesterners. Butterfield's has branched out to create a hand full of locations in IL and AZ. No matter how many locations they have, IMO, the location on butterfield road back in IL will be their best. I won't eat my mom's pancakes but I'll eat the pancakes at the butterfields on butterfield road (sorry mom!). The other locations, including the one I'm supposedly reviewing, are lacking something the butterfield road location seemingly has mastered. Even the naperville, IL location is sub par. Hmm perhaps they should clone the cooks at the butterfield location in order to ensure a consistently tasty product."}
{"text":"Very disappointed !!! We love coming to Butters for cheese grits. Today, at noon, the waitress said they were out!!! In fact , she said they are usually out of cheese grits earlier and IT HAPPENS ALMOST EVERYDAY!!!!! I chose Butters over another restaurant. I would not have not today and may not in the future, if this problem does not get fixed."}
{"text":"If you like a great breakfast at a good value and good service in a nice atmosphere then look no further."}
{"text":"Love it! especially their pumpkin french toast and their iced mocha. also whenever we drive past the area my three year old daughter always mentions that she needs her pancakes and coloring paper. the service is great too, great staff and management :-)"}
{"text":"Wow this was a real disappointment. I have never felt so pushed out and unwelcome in a restaurant before. No waiting, restaurant about half full. After being seated the young waitress expressed horror that I was by myself. There were at least 3 other tables with solitary diners, as is everywhere you go. What is the issue? Food arrived in 5 minutes. Came by 3 minutes after that asking if she could get a box for the food I had just started eating. Left the check. Now I am uncomfortable. Out of there and driving away in less than 10 minutes. Seemed like this young girl has not had a job before, not trained, and is socially awkward. Needs to lose the stinkeye. Food was ok, a few unique dishes. Pricing is now the same as everywhere else. Overall clean enough, parking was a minor issue. Front greeters/coffeebar staff all friendly and helpful as one would expect. This place is off the list for weekend brunch."}
{"text":"I never rate any restaurant a 5 star, since I believe there is nothing perfect about a restaurant.  Until now.  At first I was annoyed at the 15 minute wait, but then I was seated and as usual asked what I wanted to order. I ordered pancakes and bacon. Unlike normal restaurants I got served within 5 minutes of ordering. The bacon was excellent and the pancakes too. I felt like I was in heaven.  I do not think I will ever visit a better breakfast place again. As I was thinking up this review, as usual I thought of what was wrong with it. I couldn't think of anything. This totally beats out iHop. This restaurant is perfect, and I never say that."}
{"text":"I don't like breakfast places.  When I sit down at a table and someone asks me if I want coffee, I'm immediately disgusted.  If I wanted dirty bean water, I'd sip the mud-sludge out of a gutter on Via de Ventura.  I also don't crave eggs or grits or toast.  I am a man, and I am powered by steak, and burgers, and alcohol.  I also hate the atmosphere of breakfast places.  Sunny, and open, with weird art on the walls - no.  So that said, my co-worker talked me into going here, and it is awesome.  Yeah you go in and it's all sunny and there are a bunch of families there, and grandma and grandpa took little junior to get some waffles, and they try to serve you coffee as if you're a dirty hobo, but the food... hoooooly cow, man.  The food is delicious.  I'm talking about thick strips of bacon - as thick as a strip of beef jerky, and cooked to perfection: crispy, but not burnt.  I grabbed an Eggs Benedict with hash browns, and the entire plate figuratively slid down my throat.  Nothing was greasy or oily, but it had to be unhealthy as delicious as it was.  But it did not feel unhealthy! The orange juice was freshly squeezed (I had a seed in mine!  That's authentic!) and delicious.  The service was fast (for a breakfast place), and reasonably courteous.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Is not quite Matt's Big Breakfast, but the kids love it (chocolate chip pancakes) and the wait is manageable.  The breakfast menu has everything on it you could ever want.  I'm a fan of the spinach and feta omelettes...just be prepared for all the food that comes with them.  And make sure you get plenty of those hash browns."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim when we were out in Arizona for spring training and loved it. I'm so sad we don't have more places like this in California. Every Time  we come to az we have to eat here. Both times service and food were excellent."}
{"text":"I have been to Butters on numerous occasions - the latest being with three senior golfing friends from out of town.  Over the last few years, we have tried numerous breakfast places on their trips, searching for a breakfast that would satisfy all of their different tastes.  After trying six or seven different places, I brought them to Butters, since it was on our way to the golf course.   We all ordered something different, including a skillet, bacon and eggs, pancakes, and an omelette.  The service was fast, and friendly. In fact, we have one picky eater, who always sends his bacon back, because it isn't as crisp as he demands.  The waitress handled his grumbling very nicely, and even had him laughing about it.  The atmosphere is somewhat trendier than Butterfields, which was a very big plus for my senior friends.  They also commented on the friendly service, and the reasonable prices. It didn't surprise me that when it came time for breakfast on the final three days they were here, they all voted to come to Butters for breakfast.  It should be noted that we came on the weekdays when it isn't as busy on the weekends. I have been in the area on weekends, and it always appears that there is a waiting line.  The only thing keeping it from more stars, are the hash browns.  They are obviously prepackaged (or at least taste that way) - and a real breakfast place should have signature hash browns.  But all in all, a nice addition to the area."}
{"text":"The wait was a little long for 9 in the morning, but it was definitely worth it. The scramble platters are just average...nothing special, but I highly recommend the benedicts and french toast. Of the options, we decided on the Irish Benny and Stuffed Strawberry Cheesecake Toast. These 2 dishes are not pt of a healthy breakfast but it's worth every calorie. The pancakes here are also light and fluffy. The food came ~6 or 7 minutes after we ordered, so even with a full restaurant, the kitchen staff was really quick. TLDR: Great food for a reasonable price!"}
{"text":"On vacation in the area, we were looking for somewhere cheaper than the hotel restaurant for breakfast. Picked Butters because of the reviews, and it was a great choice. Omelets were light and fluffy, coffee about the best we've had outside our own home, and service was impeccable.  Can't recommend this place highly enough."}
{"text":"Just ate here this morning. I work at another breakfast restaurant and the food at Butters was AMAZING! The owner/manager came and talked with us and was extremely friendly and welcoming. Offered great suggestions on the menu and pairings with my omelette. Had a delicious smoothie to start. It wasn't loud inside which I appreciated. Everything was fresh and on point. Definitely gotta check this place out if you haven't. Thank you for a wonderful breakfast experience. Great way to start the day."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great menu and great service. The location is great and the interior is super cute. Just get there early or you may have to wait!"}
{"text":"We're usually very picky people when it deals with food and were impressed with this place. We had the strawberry cheesecake and huevos rojo which came out surprisingly quick, food was delicious. The staff was friendly and attentive and coffee was always full!"}
{"text":"Where to even start?! I have come here only 4 times and each time has been absolutely amazing. From the food to the service, theres not one problem I have come upon. After reading previous reviews,  I saw waiting times were sometimes long (which I would expect, seeing as that their food is amazing!) but the most I have ever had to wait is 15-20min and thats nothing. I work in this type of industry and know all about service and let me say Butters has it down well! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I almost hate to write this because this place is already jam packed when you try to go there BUT..  THIS IS THE BEST BREAKFAST PLACE IN TOWN.  I've been to almost all of them, Egg N Joe, Butterfields, Matt's Big Breakfast, all the big chain places.    I was most impressed with the large variety of traditional items and the huge portions.  Everything i got seemed extremely fresh and came out nice and hot.  Even though they were busy to the MAX, service and quality of food was maintained.  Love the big bottle of their brand of syrup that was brought to the table FULL and SPARKLING CLEAN - not sticky and half used up like other places.   I would eat here everyday if I didn't want to blow up my weight.  Just look for all the people standing outside.   Only downside is that the place isn't big enough for the crowds trying to get in.  :)"}
{"text":"Food is great. Orange juice is overpriced."}
{"text":"Butters is probably the most consistent breakfast restaurant in the area.  It is very popular on weekends and often a wait for a table.  But, the wait is well worth it.  The quality is excellent which has been consistent over the years.  The staff is friendly and efficient which keeps the wait times short.  The manager/owner Danny is always there which attests to the quality.      Breakfast meals are large often served with toast and other goodies.  The location makes this a popular place for the bicyclists who will stop by whose path is next to the Indian Bend Wash Recreation Path.    The place is bright and contemporary.  Absolutely spotless and well maintained.    Menu items include pancakes, eggs, omelets and crepes as well as fresh fruit with granola or oatmeal.  For those who prefer lunch items there is sandwich items as chicken sandwiches, french dip, burgers and salads.  During the summer make sure you have a glass of fresh OJ, and I do mean fresh squeezed, as the squeezing machine is on the left as you pass the front counter.  During the winter switch over to the hot chocolate.     For someone who loves the place and keeps coming back, why not five stars you ask?  My response is, \"They do so well with what they have, I'd like to see them create some specials for some old-times like me.\""}
{"text":"Update: After visiting Vincent's on Camelback, I can no longer say that this is my favorite place for breakfast. I'm sorry, but Vincent's puts all breakfast/brunch spots to shame! :-D"}
{"text":"For the first time I tried the Egg plate with bacon, hash browns, and blueberry pancakes. I would have liked more blueberries in the pancakes, although, they did offer a side of blueberry sauce. The bacon and hash browns were crisp. I will definitely be back, and am looking forward to trying their skillet!! (Sr Plata's Granddaughter)   This restaurant was excellent for Breakfast, had the Swedish Cakes filled with Lingonberry that blew IHOP out of the water!  My daughter-in-law did say it tasted too buttery, but Sr Plata was Happy! My 2 eggs and extra crispy hash browns were well made.  I look forward to coming back and trying out one of their amazing looking skillets!"}
{"text":"We are here vacationing for a few days and wanted a yummy breakfast. I found a few places on Yelp, Butters had the best reviews. It was phenomenal! My boyfriend and I both ordered the Mexicana omelette and a side of wild berry stuffed crepes. The fresh squeezed OJ is to die for. The omelet were so light and fluffy, stuffed with. Chorizo, avocado,onion, cheddar cheese and topped with green chile sauce...delicious'nnWe generally eat light and small meals, but we devoured our breakfast. Totally recommend"}
{"text":"I debated for a while whether or not to write something negative.  Yelp is a valuable service so here it goes. I have been to Butters three times.  All three times I had the Popeye Scrambler.  It is GREAT.  However, they miss the mark in a few areas.  The hash browns were awful.  They tasted like powdered, instant potatoes.    The menu is the same as Butterfield's.  I asked the waitress how they are trying to be different and she said that they're aiming for a cafe feel.  However, they have no place for people to sit with laptops.  No bar at the coffee station.  Instead they packed as many tables as possible into the place and destroyed the energy.  It feels hectic, not calm like a cafe should.    Here comes the thunder.  The pancakes are AWFUL.  I would rate them a 2 out of 10.  They are gritty and are somewhere between tasteless and tasting bad.  I've had them three times and waited to write a review until I truly felt okay about writing something negative about a business in my neighborhood.  They advertise a product that they are terrible at.  The best pancakes in town are at JP Pancake up on Mountain View and Hayden, but everything else at JP Pancake sucks.  The best overall place for breakfast we have found is The Daily Dose on Scottsdale Rd. and Indian School."}
{"text":"Favorite breakfast place in the Western US. You know it has to be amazing when you go at 10:00 in the morning on a Monday, and the wait is 30 min."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best.  We have been there several times, all on Sunday morning.  The first experience the food was very good, but the noise level was soooooo high you could not have a conversation.  The next visit....we both commented that the hash browns were very greasy. We didn't eat them. Today...7:15am...the noise level was tolerable since the restaurant was not full yet. But again...the hash browns were sooooo greasy. We both had an upset stomach for the rest of the day. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"This place serves traditional, great and consistent food each time I go. The best part , you get served fast. It gets too crowded on weekends but it's worth the trip. My fav ... Their Dutch baby, crepes and egg benedicts is a \" must try \""}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place in Scottsdale. Their egg omelettes are fluffy and taste baked. I especially enjoy the grits and the power pancakes. The restaurant is clean and the service is always excellent. Certainly worth a try."}
{"text":"Great breakfast selection with a good patio during winter season. The place is alway busy and long wait time is a norm but it is worth the wait. The skillets are my favorite."}
{"text":"This place came highly recommended by friends and Yelp so we decided to finally check it out and I'm glad we did.    Growing up in the Breakfast is probably my favorite meal of the day. Growing up in the south, my mom made a huge deal of a Sunday breakfast and did not hold back at all.  While I can't eat like that anymore (or shouldn't), I appreciate a good breakfast joint.  This place was very solid.  We waited for about 30 minutes for a table to open up, but it was nice outside and there were plenty of other kids outside to keep mine entertained.   The other Yelp reviews are correct in that it is a very small place, but the food is really good and comes out almost as soon as you order it.  I got the chicken, avocado scrambler with egg whites which was great for anyone watching their intake.  It came with a side of pancakes and they also had some healthy options there as well.  The kids loved their Mickey Mouse pancakes and my wife devoured her french toast. A little pricey for a breakfast place, but you get big portions and it is no different than Snooze, Breakfast Club,...  Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious. Food was great and there was plenty of it! The specialty pancakes were ridiculously good, our waitress was so kind and patient with my three indecisive children, and the prices were very reasonable. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Food: I had the Florentine eggs benedict with hash browns. The spinach was prepared so well and the hollandaise was perfectly smooth-- lately I've been to places that make it more goopy. Also, I've never had grits until I came here, and I thought they were good. Mind you I've never had them before so that may or may not be valid.  Service: I LOVED it. They were very quick (10 minutes between ordering and food being brought) and quiet. I really don't care for the wishy-washy over the time \"how is everything? Is there anything else I can get for you?\" service-- they came when I needed them and left when my needs were met.  The atmosphere tops it off-- the decor isn't super fancy but it's quiet enough to enjoy reading the paper.   Worth the 20 minute drive!"}
{"text":"This is a great breakfast/brunch spot for families. My only complaint is that we sometimes have to wait : ( though it's always worth it!"}
{"text":"Was excited to try Butters for breakfast this past weekend because it is so close to my house but was definitely disappointed. When we walked in to put our name on the list we did not receive a warm welcome. We asked for a table for four but told them the other two people in our party would be joining us in about 30  minute. They said everyone had to be there in order to seat us. The manager came over and he was even more rude to us. Told us there was nothing he could do, that unless everyone was there they would only give us a table for two. I looked into the restaurant and there were several parties of two people who were seated at tables for four. Super disappointed in the customer service aspect of this place so didn't even stay Won't be coming back!!"}
{"text":"I found out about Butters on the weekly Yelp emails and had to go check them out. I'm not often in the area, but if we're even remotely close by I'll make sure to go.   It's a cute place- accessible and service tends to be great. They seat you quickly, in spite of a crowd that collects during peak hours. Really nice large, shaded patio. Keep in mind I've only gone there either by myself of with my husband though, so it's not as if they're trying to accommodate huge groups that show up at the last minute.   I'm rating this place 3.5 stars rounded down to 3. It's solid, with a good brunch selection that is also great about catering to you if you're attempting to eat healthier. I've always subbed out my eggs for egg whites, and taste and flavor isn't compromised in the least. I've had the scrambled eggs with salmon, and built my own omelette as well. Their grits deserve an extra special mention- creamy and smooth and silky. I don't know that the cheese is really that much more awesome than the plain, it's just that good. Their bacon is also really great.   It's a good stand by for when you want brunch. If I lived in the area I'd be a lot more regular. It's no cutting edge, creative brunch place, but the stuff that they do make is always on point, and is very good. Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"LOVED it! Cute, classy upbeat, friendly spot in Scottsdale. The waitress was super friendly, their service was quick and the food was fantastic! AND they had delicious gluten free pancakes. Its worth the drive from Gilbert!"}
{"text":"The original Butters is my favorite breakfast place in Scottsdale, but when this location opened I tried it as well. I love that it is the exact same menu, but the wait times seem to be shorter. Not only that, but they seem to be just as consistent. Not only have I not had anything bad on the menu, but they will make everything on their menu healthier. They will use egg white or Pam instead of butter upon request and they are really good about substituting potatoes or breads whereas a lot of other restraints are more difficult about these things or you don't know how something is being cooked. Aside from just being able to get a healthy breakfast, their scrambles are delicious! And if you are in the mood for a treat they have great pancakes and their bacon is probably the best I have had in the area. Also, the juices are fresh, the coffee is good and the coffee drinks are wonderful!   It is really hard to get a table at Butters over the weekend, so go at an off time if you can to try it!"}

{"text":"Delicious food!  Timely service.  The cranberry chicken salad is great."}
{"text":"Good breakfast spot. We had a short wait to get in and enjoyed a coffee by the fountain while we waited. Good portions, reasonable prices and ultra-friendly staff. This is definitely on our short list for breakfast every time we come to Scottsdale in the future."}
{"text":"This is the first real place I went to eat at after moving to Arizona. We went on a Sunday and of course it was packed out, so we had to wait about an hour to be seated. It was absolutely worth the wait. The pancakes were so light and fluffy, probably the best I've ever had at any restaurant I've ever been to. The syrup was even better, not too sweet or too heavy. The pricing is reasonable too, especially for the good quality of the food. Service was extremely fast, especially considering how many people were there. I can't wait to go back again and try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"I love trying out new spots. Found this place on yelp and stopped in for the first time a few weeks ago.  I ordered fresh oj eggs bacon potatoes and choose pancake as my side.  It was alot.of food and asked to have half packed to go.   There were a few glitches. ...but the waiter was fabulous.  He excused himself and shortly the manager came to see me.  The situation was immediately rectified....mind you I was never upset. I simply pointed it out to the waiter.  I was so impressed with the prompt action and value placed on their quality of service and food.  To that end....the food was incredible.   I will be back."}
{"text":"Great place to have breakfast. Good food. Good Coffee. Good service. Nice ambiance. Nice sized portions. What more do you want. No brainer if you're in this part of Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place ! I had the eggs Benedict and they were delicious . Service was excellent ! Looking forward to going back ."}
{"text":"I've gone here several times and have never been disappointed- this is probably my favorite breakfast spot in Scottsdale.  There can be a wait if you arrive after 10 (especially if it's too hot to sit on the patio), but they seem pretty efficient in turning over tables and seating people.  Service has always been speedy and the portions are huge!  Good gluten free pancakes as well."}
{"text":"What can I say other than, start the day with Butters!!!  I was on stay-cation in the area and we went to Butters based on yelp reviews.  We went on a weekday morning, the staff was very friendly and all of the employees had a smile on their faces.  You can taste the difference in food when the people making and serving it enjoy what they do.  We decided to split two meals so we could both try more of the flavors this delightful breakfast place had to offer.   We had split a make your own omelet with chorizo, bacon, onion, and red jalapeño..  The flavor of the bacon was not overwhelmed by the chorizo and it wasn't too greasy like you often get with a chorizo omelet.  The eggs were light and fluffy, and made a nice balanced omelet with the ingredients that were chosen.  The hash browns were crispy on the outside and not just mush on the inside.  Great Start!!!  Then for a wonderful finish we split the cinnamon roll pancakes...  It was amazing, the texture was so light and delicate, I was impressed as to how they managed to take an oversized cinnamon roll and flatten it without damaging the fluffy integrity of a delicious roll.  The frosting was great and balanced with hints of citrus.  Everything about our experience was fantastic and our only regret is that it is too far from us!!  This is one of the best breakfast places either of us have ever been to and would definitely return and recommend."}
{"text":"First timers. It was spectacular. Best hash browns we've had in a long time. Super tasty fresh squeezed OJ. Great service, spectacular food. You can not go wrong here. So glad we tried it. Great Yelp find!"}
{"text":"Very good breakfast, lots of food and it is cooked just right.  Breakfast potatoes are super, and their pancakes are excellent.  Good coffee and good service, always coming around checking up on you."}
{"text":"Delicious! The best pancakes I've had in a very long time. I recommend the whole wheat pancakes."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious. We ordered the California Scrambler and Corner Beef Hash Skillet. I'm loving the food portion here in AZ. Reminds me of CA many years ago. Definitely the place to be for breakfast."}
{"text":"OMG, such awesomeness! This is our de facto breakfast joint now ... hard to go anywhere else even if we have to invariably wait in long lines (they don't take reservations or \"call ahead\"). As with most restaurants, some items on the menu are better than others. For us, it's the Potato Omelette (fat, as in big, and surprisingly yummy, and the Swedish Cakes (deliciously light crepes with the most addictive ligonberry butter, you won't even need maple syrup). See you again on Sunday morning!"}
{"text":"Arrived for breakfast at 10:15 to see a crowd of people waiting for their tables. Gave my name to the hostess and was advised the wait was a hour. While an hour wait would normally deter me, this place was well worth the wait. I has scrambled eggs verde with chorizo and it was wonderful. The eggs were amazingly light and fluffy and the service was unbelievably quick. Definitely the best breakfast I have had in a very long time."}
{"text":"Looking for a great breakfast spot in Scottsdale. Read the reviews and rushed over here.  Everything was tasty.  We had a litte bit of a wait but normal considering other options.  Love the ambience of the place and fresh squeezed OJ.  We dined for a family of 4 and a toddler and no complaints!"}
{"text":"Had the Classic Benny and split a Short Stack with my wife. Eggs were cooked perfect, hollandaise was consistent and creamy, coffee was really good. We'll be going back the next time we are in the area."}
{"text":"Butters was a great spot for our Sunday brunch. I was anticipating a very crowded restaurant, with a long wait, much like its sister restaurant Butterfield's on Shea. I was pleasantly surprised that we were seated right away.   Neither hubby or I could decide between the breakfast and lunch menu. Everything we saw that was brought out from the kitchen looked enticing. Hubby opted for the corned beef hash skillet with raisin toast! He proclaimed it as the best corned beef hash he's had here in the valley -- quite the compliment. I, being the pickier eater of the two of us, ordered the grilled cheese sandwich on artisan bread with bacon . . . my preference always is the bacon had to be done very well and the fries, almost burnt. And that is pretty much what I got and loved every bite!   Service was friendly, but not overwhelmingly so. Coffee and iced tea were both refilled without having to ask or wait too long. The restaurant itself is pleasant, clean and well laid out. I hope to be able to sit on their patio soon, if we get a day below 100 degrees. Expect nothing fancy. The bathrooms were immaculate. Prices are very reasonable!   I loved that the employees get to eat in the restaurant on break . . . if they sit next to you, then you'll know what to order next time. The salads looked so delicious!   We'll be back . . ."}
{"text":"I love the location because it's bike riding distance from my house.  The food isn't anything Denny's doesn't provide and well \"I don't eat at Denny's ever; okay ever sober and exclusively in the hours of 3am-5am.  That all being said the food is fine, service was slow and all things were done with attitude (been there twice and had the same experience with different people).    Finally... I called on Mother's Day to see about getting our name in and/or finding out about the wait- went something like this.  Me: \"Hi I was wondering how long the wait was or if I could put my name in for a table.\" Butters dude: \"We don't take reservations.\"  Me: \"Well how long is the wait?\"  Butters dude:  \"Well it's mothers day!\"  Me \"Okay thanks I didn't know that...\"  Well of course I knew it was Mothers day that is why I called!  Ended-up at the Spotted Donkey! Have been there twice since and well it's close.  If you can walk there fine but save the gas!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast I have ever had. Period. Omelet fluffy, pancakes fluffy as well! Attentive waitress, quick service. Can't think of anything that they could do better. Perfection. 10 stars!"}
{"text":"Wow.  Awesome service by Willie. He was extremely attentive and such a nice gentleman to all of his patrons. He should commended for his efforts with a big smile.  Great experience!!"}
{"text":"This place was absolutely amazing. The service was great and the food was even better. Went in thinking pancakes are the things to get (and trust me they were amazing- especially the wild berry ones) but the omelets are just as good. So light and fluffy it melts in your mouth. Would definitely recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"When traveling I'm always looking for a great local place for breakfast. My daughter in law suggested Butters. I can't imagine anyplace better for GREAT breakfast foods. Wish there was one of these in West Texas. Excellent and would give more than 5 stars if possible."}
{"text":"Best breakfast ever. Orange juice is amazing. This place is always busy no matter what day of the week, or what time it is. They even have more fruit than cantaloupe and honeydew for my infant son to eat & I think that's awesome!! I haven't had the lunch here yet because I'm so stuck on the breakfast haha!"}
{"text":"This place is superb. Top notch service, top notch food. Best breakfast place I've been to in the valley. I had grapefruit juice,  chorizo avacado omelette and pancakes. Every item exceeded my expectations. Would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! Me and my girlfriend went for breakfast this morning, as soon as we walked in the wonderful aroma of fresh oranges took over our senses. The orange juice (little pricy $5 for large) was the best ever..I had the classic eggs Benedict it was delicious, perfectly poached eggs and very tasty hollandaise. My girlfriend had the vegetable skillet and loved it. Perfect hash browns and a side of wonderful light fluffy pancakes (I ate them) soo good. Everything for just over $30. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great food, good service. I always get the fresh squeezed orange juice and the coffee is good too! No complaints here.. I'll be back again soon"}
{"text":"We just had a great breakfast here. The staff was very attentive and friendly and the food was delicious (try the corned beef skillet). Plus, no wait on a Sunday morning!"}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast spot: still dreaming of the wild berry French toast.  We stopped in after the great reviews & knew there may be a wait.  We were seated at once and brought coffee.  I went for a basic breakfast... Can't remember.  Wasn't bad at all but nothing out of the ordinary.  But the wild berry French toast.  Our server recommended it as boy was she right!!!  Sweet cream cheese filling with fresh berries galore.  The French toast was thick & buttery... Butter how I love thee!  We will be back if we are near talking stick or Hayden rd."}
{"text":"Great quality meals at respectable prices and extremely fast service. My wife and I go here as often as we can (we try not to eat out too much for budget reasons) and the staff are always attentive. The food is high quality and tasty. My personal favorite items is the Pop Eye Scrambler with Avocado: it is eggs scrambled with onion,avocado,baby spinach, and bacon. For two adults with drinks and meals runs us on average about $26 after a 20% tip for the great staff. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Love the salmon omelette, fresh OJ & great pancakes! Family friendly, but unfortunately waits can be very long. Patio is not always open even on busy days - makes no sense to me."}
{"text":"Fantastic service and the food was rich but so good! From the savory to the sweet. I definitely recommend this place, do yourself a favor and get a waffle whether it's for you or the table to share"}
{"text":"Excellent food and equally excellent service --- all at extremely reasonable prices.  My wife had the corned beef hash skillet which comes with pancakes, hash browns and eggs...all for $10.50.  I had the prime rib sandwich...and we both enjoyed our choices immensely.  It's a 40 minute ride from our home in south Chandler but well worth the ride...so to paraphrase Arnold, \"We'll be bock\"."}
{"text":"The wait for a table on a Sunday morning around 9am was longer than 30 min but we got our food within 10 minutes of ordering and it was worth every second! Coffee was amazing, service was friendly and seamless.  I had the Mexicana Omelete and it didn't disappoint. It came with pancakes and hash browns. Totally worth it!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast places in the area. They keep it simple so if you're looking for a super hip, trendy place that does a deconstructed French Toast served on a piece of driftwood, this isn't the place. If you're looking for a solid breakfast and some of the best pancakes around, get in here. Big portions and not that many low cal options so bring your appetite and leave you new year's resolution at home :)"}
{"text":"Had brunch here on saturday.  I had the eggs Benedict with spinach and my hubby had a scramble with strawberry pancakes.  We sat outside in the patio since it was a beautiful day.  It took about 40 minutes to be seated but well worth the wait.  I will for sure return for breakfast or brunch.  Totally recommend it."}
{"text":"When you find a place with a full parking lot along with a long wait list and people waiting outside in the Phoenix summer sun: 9 times out of 10 you're very close to striking gold!   I did today at this awesome breakfast spot. The food is bomb.com period! I mean it was 12:00 p.m. and everyone was ordering breakfast.  The place is clean the customer service was top notch. They spoke so many times it almost became annoying. I really don't think you can go wrong here. Give it a go I think this is a sure bet."}
{"text":"Only average. I got the salmon skillet and it was a bit tasteless. I could have made a better one at home. I asked for \"well-done\" hash browns and when the waitress brought them out they were definitely NOT well done and she said \"sorry the kitchen couldn't make them that way. Do you want fruit instead\". First off, how can the kitchen NOT leave them on the stove longer, and secondly I felt like it would have been more courteous to offer me fruit prior to bringing the food out with the Barry cooked hash browns. I did order the wild berry pancakes and did enjoy them. Probably should have stuck with my first choice in going to Hash Kitchen!"}
{"text":"We requested a seat outdoors. They sat us indoors. They were busy so we didn't say anything. The food was good and delivered in a short amount to time. The service left something to be desired. The server made it very obvious she was ready for us to leave. As a server myself I understand wanting to turn your table. However, it is never okay to make the guest feel rushed. Too bad for her, I would have tipped extra as \"table rent\". I won't be back. There are too many other good places to eat."}
{"text":"Great food. Eggs Benedict was very well done, and the California scramble was delicious."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite breakfast spots! Friendly staff delicious food and the price is just right! very pro first responder as well!"}
{"text":"This is our second time coming here when we visit. We can't imagine a better breakfast place from the Benedict's, to the Oreo s'mores pancakes they have something for everyone.   Breakfast is under 10 a person unless you order the fresh squeezed oj then you might need to sell one of your kidneys but its worth it."}
{"text":"It seems everyone is raving about this place... I don't get it.   After weeks of saying I wanted to try it out, last Sunday we waited almost 40 minutes for a table for two. It should have only been 20 minutes, but our buzzer wasn't working and nobody came looking for us when we didn't come in (we had to wait out by the fountain, because there was no room any closer to the door). I finally went in and asked only to see that over 10 other parties had been seated before us, even though they came after us. And to top it off, the hostess blamed us, saying we were out of reach. We stood as close as we could and others around us had buzzers that did work, so try another excuse.  As for the food, it's average. I got the pecan waffle with strawberries and my husband got the fried egg and bacon bagel sandwich with hash browns. I can't say the food was bad, but really not that flavorful and again, average. The best thing was the OJ.  I'm glad we finally tried it, because now we can cross it off the list for good."}
{"text":"Excellent food, w/lots of breakfast variety. Had the Santa Fe scramble & corned beef hash omelet w/out cheese & eggs verdes ... Each of us liked our options. Cheese grits were slightly sweet( not certain what type of cheese they use), so I'd get plain cheese next time. Santa Fe scrambled eggs were great, spicy & huge(took much home); home fries are sliced potato fries in a pan- asked for crispy: phenomenal. Pancake side(2) were fluffy & hot. Eggs verdes w/2 fried eggs was yummy; had black beans inside(gluten free). We three will definitely go here again. Told a 30-35 min wait. It was less than 20. We got drinks and waited outside. Wish we'd grabbed a menu while we were waiting (duhh). Overall: excellent!"}
{"text":"Does this place really need more 5-star ratings?  It's no secret that Butters is truly a magical breakfast experience.  The service is great, the food is exceptional, the ambiance is comforting, oh...and pancakes are served as a side to almost every dish they serve.  Most places give you toast...this place gives you pancakes.  And they are good.  But please...spring for the Vermont Maple Syrup.  It's like a dollar, and the pancakes will thank you."}
{"text":"Drove by many times and noticed people waiting outside in large numbers.  After eating here it is not hard to see why.  The best scrambled eggs ever, great everything and awesome service all for a reasonable price.  I would have to say this is the best breakfast place in Scottsdale.  They earned the four and-a-half star ratings!"}
{"text":"Love it! Great food and great service all for a great price. Go on the earlier side on weekends, gets packed"}
{"text":"Today, my dad and I went here for the first time.  We had a 15 minute wait but once we were in, there was no wait getting our drinks.  We ordered and I asked for an omlette with onions, cheddar cheese, feta cheese, spinach and bacon.  It was the fluffiest omlette I have ever ever ever eaten!  Holy smokes!  The hash browns were definitely fresh, crispy and hot!  The pancakes were simply fantastic!  My 91 year old dad had pancakes, fried egg, fruit and bacon.  He ate everything but a piece of bacon.    Our server, Karissa, was funny, pleasant and efficient.  The bus girl worked her butt off and never stopped!  The only thing I saw that was off was the manager.  He never smiled or said a kind word to the staff.  I watched and I read lips pretty darn well and he never said a nice thing.  He seemed put off if he decided to step in and help serve coffee or start bussing a table and there never was a time the staff was slacking.  He just never seemed satisfied.  The place is small and BUSY BUSY BUSY but the food comes out quickly!  I will go again!"}
{"text":"I have been twice, and will come again!!  I live probably 30-40 minutes from here, but it is well worth the drive and wait (if there is one)!!  The corn beef hash skillet is amazing, potatoes are great!  Also the pancake is crisp on the outside but so fluffy inside.  The biscuits and gravy taste like grandmas, to die for!  Lastly, the banana cream pancakes are out of this world amazing!!  They are sweet, but the combo is incredibly delicious!!  I can't wait to come back again!!!!   Butters does it right, go here immediatly!!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast. I had the country benny and my wife had an omelette. Both were very good. The service was very fast and friendly. We went about 8:45 am on a Friday morning and there was no wait. There are several things on their menu that I would like to try on another visit."}
{"text":"This is my first Yelp review! I think this is the best waffle I ever had. I'm not really sure why. Also I really like the ice tea which is very light. The atmosphere is nice but it is a bit too loud for my taste because I have bad hearing."}
{"text":"This place was great! We stopped here for breakfast on a Monday and I was surprised at how busy it was for a weekday. We were sat within about 20 minutes which was not too bad. I ordered the Mexican Skillet, my husband got the Baked Potato Omelette, kids got the French toast sticks and classic waffle. The food came out quickly and it was so delicious! The ingredients were fresh and portions were significant. Service was friendly and prompt. We will definitely be back! We live in Glendale and I would say it's worth the drive if you're in search of a great breakfast place."}
{"text":"First, the menu.... So many delicious choices.  So many, in fact, I struggled to make a decision.  Our waitress was patient and helpful in helping me narrow down my choices.  Eggs, homemade corned beef hash, and an order of Wildberry pancakes (fresh berries and a delicious sweet drizzle of puréed berries and glaze). Wow!  One minor complaint...the booths are tight...  Grab a table for comfort sake.   Enjoy!!!!"}
{"text":"If you can make it past the group of smart-asses standing up front doing absolutely nothing, it's an OK place to eat. The food comes out very quickly once you've ordered, but it is just so-so and a little pricey for what it is.  It was also a bit difficult to track down the waiter when we finished eating and getting back the check. Not sure if our waiter spoke English but we hardly saw him..."}
{"text":"Awesome spot. Best breakfast / brunch spot ever. Really good food. Just takes forever to get a seat since there always so busy. But it's worth the wait. :)"}
{"text":"Not for large groups. Went for breakfast on Sunday, May 20th with family to celebrate daughter's graduation.  I called ahead to inquire about getting a reservation for our large group (10) or to see if there was a wait list to get on before arriving.  Was told there was a list, but that at least one person of your group had to be there to be on it. (? what is the point of having a \"list\" then).  Decided to go anyway and plan to wait.  When we arrived was told the wait was 20 minutes, not bad for a Sunday morning.  However, ended up waiting 40 minutes while watching other guests get seated.  When I asked how much longer for our table, I was told they were setting it up in the back.  I took a peek to see, and there was nothing being set up.  Had another talk with the hostess, and the \"manager\" Ted stepped in and said our group had a longer wait because the other diners were small parties and they were waiting for tables to open up to seat us. I asked about why some of the smaller tables couldn't have been put together for us and was again told that they were small and unable to accommodate us unless we wanted to split up our group.  Finally did get seated and on our way to our table, noticed a similar sized  group at those \"smaller\" tables.    Food was good, service was good, but the tip was reflective of the poor customer service of the manager.  If this is the same guy that another reviewer wrote about, would recommend some re-training in hospitality.  He did not offer any apologies for the extended wait or once we were finally seated come by to see how our meal was.  I would not recommend this place for groups larger than 4."}
{"text":"OMG.  The pumpkin french toast is what I decided on after much deliberation and it was so delicious.  If I had been in town longer I probably would have stopped by more days to try other things on the menu.  I love finding unique breakfast options and Butter's didn't disappoint!"}
{"text":"Great food and reasonable prices. Be careful about sitting outside, it's a busy intersection with some loud noise and the tables don't afford much leg room !"}
{"text":"Wife and I visiting for the weekend and we found this place on the strength of yelp reviews, and am I glad we did. The place was packed - always a good sign - on a Friday morning around 10AM, so there was a 30 minute wait. That was fine because once we sat down the fun started. Just looking over the menu and looking at other people's orders was sort of fun, as goofy as that sounds.   I settled on the Hogs Gone Wild Scramble and upgraded to the Oreo pancakes. Wife ordered a different scramble and upgraded to the Wild Berry Pancakes. The upgrade is worth it. Once ordered, our food came quickly and was hot all the way through. I love how the potatoes were prepared in the scrambles: the right amount of potato taste and crispiness. Eggs were some of the fluffiest I've ever had, and there was meat in every bite of my Hogs Gone Wild. The Wild Berry Pancakes are filled with cream, drizzled, err drenched in an awesome glaze, and served with the freshest berries. The Oreo Pancakes are topped with crumbled Oreos and smothered with a marshmallow cream and chocolate sauce. As delicious as the Oreo pancakes were, it was a case of too much of a good thing, I only made it though half of my cakes. It's not very often I don't finish my whole meal, but this was one of those times.   Additionally, my seat allowed me a pretty good look of the kitchen and I noticed the cooks all had hair nets, even the guy who barely had any hair. There was one young lady who looked as though her job was to keep things clean and running smoothly. As a former food service worker, I appreciated what I saw. I would definitely recommend this place, and I look forward to coming again."}
{"text":"The pancakes here are amazing. Service is good. Seating area is small so there is usually a wait to be seated. Prices are very reasonable too."}
{"text":"if u haven't been here... and want to try something different.... there Mexican omelette is to die for.. my wife and I just woke up.. and wife said.. butters pancakes with that chorizo omelette!!!! the problem.. we only have $13.00 lol   wife.. I found an extra $5.. get the baby !!!!! let's go!!!"}
{"text":"I love this breakfast restaurant. It usually has a wait on the weekend mornings but they give you a pager and it's right near a lake - so just go for a walk while you wait - and weather permitting - get patio seating. The food is excellent. I ordered the skillet with blueberry pancakes. It was delicious! Make sure to request REAL maple syrup though, as they have the fake stuff at the table. Everything was delicious, eggs, hashbrowns and veggies all fresh and cooked perfectly. A nice way to start the day and also a good place to bring friends and family from out of town."}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp, found this place with great reviews and they did not disappoint. My omelet was as fluffy as a soufflé. My Veggie was like eating a cloud of garden goodness. Try it, you'll like it!"}
{"text":"A great spot for a delicious breakfast! The variety of pancakes will give everyone something they'd like and they are delicious and fluffy. I got a scrambler which was full of delicious and fresh tasting ingredients and my husband got the Irish eggs Benedict and cleaned his plate. We also split a cappuccino and their coffee was delicious as well. Service is fast and food is good! My only thought for improvement was I wish the peppers and onions in my scrambler had been cooked a little bit longer so that they were softer."}
{"text":"Fresh squeezed OJ!  Had popeye scrambler. Onion bacon jack cheese. Sour dough toast was delish"}
{"text":"Food was good, this was expected though.  Service on the other hand need improvement.  Server was uncomfortable and awkward.  They also appear to have issues with customizing your order, I had asked for burnt breakfast potatoes (every other breakfast place does this) and they refused.  Very odd and to bad.  Update:  kinks have been worked out.  Service and food are both great!   Another update: Food is still good but man, I have never been to a restaurant that tries so hard to enforce rules rather than accommodate the patrons.  I was recently scolded by there staff on a pick up order.  I wanted to pick up an order at 11 for lunch, I had a 10:30 meeting so I called it in at 10:20.  Hostess gladly took the order and said \"see you at 11\".  When I got there the staff scolded me and said that they do not \"hold\" orders and that this will never happen again in the future.  Small example but just another case of a restaurant that does not want to truly serve you but rather enforce the rules.... food is great but unfortunately I will never come back.  Service is a must and butters just falls short on this.  To bad...."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place. Love the french toast and omelettes.  The service is fantastic and prompt."}
{"text":"Food was very tasty but I felt the skillet was a bit skimpy. Fresh grits were wonderful. Friendly staff but many did not speak english."}
{"text":"Long wait but well worth it. The juice is freshly squeezed and the eggs Benedict is to die for !"}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot! Get here early on the weekends because it fills up fast. The employees are very friendly and the food is really good. I ordered the Nova Lox Platter consisting of Smoked nova salmon, tomato, onion, cucumber, capers, cream cheese & a toasted bagel. It was divine! The portion is huge and the cost is very fair ($10.95). I also tasted the Country Benny with Poached eggs, sausage, biscuit & white country gravy. Amazingly light considering the ingredients. The noise level is pretty high, but it is a great place to start your day. The patio looks great, but it was too hot when I was there..."}
{"text":"I was totally impressed; friendly, funny, engaging staff and great food.  Had the Mexican omelette, it was fantastic and huge (took half of it home).  The wild berry pancake was like having desert for breakfast.  My wife had the veggie skillet, it didn't last long (usually doesn't finish her meal).  Coffee was great as well.  If you're looking for new place for breakfast, I highly suggest Butters!!"}
{"text":"Quick service!!!! Table of 6 woman and two kids. We were seated, coffees, teas and sodas came out quick. Took our orders and food was out in about 10 minutes. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Delicious food but long wait to get a table (I was here on a Saturday for brunch, of course) When we did sit, food came fast and service was good! Must have the pancakes!"}
{"text":"Food is always served quickly and hot. Love the grits. The orange juice is FRESH squeezed and amazing. I like that they have carafe of ice water in table and refill coffee frequently. We go very early otherwise there's a wait."}
{"text":"Favorite. Breakfast. In. The. Valley. Not a single disappointment on the menu. Such a cute, welcoming place and staff. Great for groups and pancakes definitely need to be ordered."}
{"text":"Food was great as well as the service. Got us in fairly quickly for a Sunday morning. Definitely will be coming back when we're back in town!"}
{"text":"Very clean. Fast, friendly efficient service. This place draws quite a crowd! Went for breakfast on a Friday morning and the place was buzzing. Not so much that we didn't get seated right away but when we left that wasn't the case. There was a line at the door. For good reason. The food is very good. I had the veggie omlet and I agree that this is one of the fluffiest omlets I've ever had. I also ordered grits and they are better than most. Very creamy, flavorful and not drenched in butter.  My friend had french toast and said it was also very good. Will definitely go back when we are again looking to have breakfast in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"The Oreo pancakes are delicious!  I'm looking forward to my next visit already!  They have a lot of different pancake options and the only thing I wish they had was the option to pick multiple flavors."}
{"text":"Food and service were amazing. The only reason I'm not doing five stars is that it was so cold inside at 10 am that it made my delicious food get cold quickly.  California Scramble is the best. Plus it comes with a side of pancakes. Can you say carb heaven? Yummy."}
{"text":"Breakfast was amazing, the eggs were fluffy, the bacon was thick cut, and I asked for vanilla cream on my pancakes, best decision, no need for syrup or butter! Fresh squeezed orange juice was refreshing!"}
{"text":"Just had a horrible experience at Butters. We arrived at 8:25 Am and asked for a table for 7. Four adults and three children. At 9:05 my fiancé asked the hostess if our table was ready. This after we watched at least 6-8 parties of 2 - 4 be seated before us. The hostess said they are watching tables. Whatever that means. The manager came over and started to raise his voice to my fiancé. I went over to see what was up and he refused service. He then told me to get out and he bumped me. What kind of business does this? The Manager and hostesses are rude and indifferent. I will not go back and will makes sure my friends and family stay away."}
{"text":"First time was last Sunday (August 2nd) and it was worth the wait time for a table. Our waiter said that this day was slow compared to other days and still we waited 25 minutes for a table. I don't care and I would've waited 2 hours for a table as this place ROCKS!!! My wife ordered the wild berry crepes and I had the banana nut crepes and while both were totally awesome, we both recommend the wild berry crepes. I think our waiter was named Rafeal and he was so patient and took care of us all the way through our \"first time\". Regardless of who waits on you, they are all excellent (so I was told). Go there, be patient and enjoy one of the best breakfast meals in the #VOTS (valley of the sun)."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Normally a wait on the weekend, but what would you expect."}
{"text":"Visited again and not disappointed.  Once again everything was delicious.  Biscuits and gravy was the best I have ever experienced."}
{"text":"Came in on a Sunday afternoon with my family and was told it would take 30 minutes for seating.  Not unexpected as they are new and had a good line waiting. As we had time I took my car over to Danny's car wash about 100 meters away while my wife and son waited at the restaurant. She texted me that they would not seat them unless I was with them at the restaurant. This seems unusual as I have never experienced this sort of thing at any restaurant. I mean what if you are waiting for someone to join you?  You can't get a seat?  That's kind of ridiculous.   With over 25 years of hospitality and customer service experience I can say that this is a poor customer experience. Hopefully they fix it quickly as the lobby will not always be filled with customers waiting. Seriously doubt I'll give them another try and can't recommend them in good faith."}
{"text":"Anytime we are visiting Scottsdale we love coming here for breakfast!  It's the best!!!  Service is quick and food is to die for!   I think my hubby and I came almost everyday for breakfast during our last visit in the area. My favorite is corn beef n hash. But you can't go wrong with anything u order!   Will be back again...hopefully soon!"}
{"text":"By far the Best Breakfast place in the Valley!   Orange Juice is fresh squeezed in the building.  So delish!  Best pancakes as well.  Banana Creme pancakes are second to none.  Pure Bliss.   Staff and Management are awesome!  Never had a bad experience.  We go every weekend, small wait at times, but well worth it!"}
{"text":"Always a great breakfast. It's a staple when we go to Scottsdale. Excellent food even if the line is huge every morning."}
{"text":"Cute place, good food. The most unique part of this restaurant is the unusual pancakes (think Oreos). Always packed on weekends"}
{"text":"Food is delicious so I will start with that!  Very shaded outside patio with seating which is not used to seat customers for dining?  Also not pet friendly.  Wasted outdoor dining space on a busy Saturday...  Most of the staff are very friendly"}
{"text":"I live in the southeast valley (Gilbert) but will take the occasional trip out to Scottsdale to eat the great breakfast served at Butters.  The omelets are large and full of flavor, especially with the fresh baby spinach.  The hash browns are wonderful too.  Great atmosphere whether with family, friends, or coworkers...especially outside when the weather is nice."}
{"text":"We got here at 2, they close at 230. People were sitting outside on patio and we asked to be seated outside. She abruptly says, uh, no patio is closed. She seats us, not friendly at all. We ordered. My french toast was soaking wet from egg batter, not cooked all the way. She finally came back and i advised her, so i said, just have them recook one. 15 mins later, i said just cancel my order. She glared at me and said they are cooking it. It came, guess what ... still not cooked. They began cleaning up at 2 ... rude. And they all had an attitude. Never going back.  Oh, and they still charged me for French toast and i didnt eat it ... her answer ... oh well."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite breakfast place in Arizona. I was staying in Tempe and made the drive up to Scottsdale and it was 100% worth it. The staff - phenomenal. Our food was ready in 10-15 minutes. The food is so out-of-this-world good. I had the garden skillet which I would highly recommend for those who aren't huge on meat. A little hot sauce and it was perfect. The pancakes (regular or wild berry) are to die for! So sweet and crispy. I would eat here every day if I could."}
{"text":"Very good breakfast place. i had the stuffed french toast and it was awesome....my friend raves how the gluten free pancakes are also fantastic....my other friend had a skillet dish that was consumed in great haste. The coffee was good, not great,....our waitress was flawless.   The negatives which are kind of not Butters fault is upon arriving at 10:30, which is kind of in between breakfast and lunch in theory, we experienced a 25 min wait. I guess this is the only breakfast place in the area. I'm from the west side so I dont know but a restauranteur could make some money opening up in the area and get Butters overflow. I very much enjoy Butters but I am not waiting 25 min for breakfast in the late morning during the week and would go elsewhere next time. For some reason the outdoor area was closed so I guess Butters could have done something about the wait times....because it was perfectly fine to eat outside weatherwise.     And because of the packed restaurant inside ....it was very loud so if that is a concern....this is not your place. And because so many people are waiting for your table....lingering is really not an option.     The other plus factor is it being north Scottsdale they do get some very hot women partaking in the cusine. Yum!"}
{"text":"I usually go to their other restaurant, Butterfields, so wanted to give this place a try instead.   It was completely unremarkable.   Upon walking in the hosted did not smile or greet us, merely asked, \"how many?\" as she turned heel and led as to an immediately available table. Quite unfriendly. The tables are crammed in this location so tighly that even a small adult has to turn sideways to squeeze between the tables to get seated. Because the tables are so tightly packed in this place that meant it was a much louder atmosphere as well. Not good for a business breakfast.  I ordered a simple 2 eggs, hash browns, and ham order. No spice of any kind was used, just how I would get them at Denny's. :(  The menu is quite similar to Butterfields but I noticed a couple of things different. Baked pancakes are not offered at this location. Secondly, the french toast comes with a scoop of vanilla icecream on top instead of whipped cream. I didn't care for that option so skipped my usual of Wildberry Bliss french toast.  Our server was the only employee in the entire restaurant that cracked a smile. Because of the cramped quarters I don't think anyone likes where they work.  With average, bland food at this location, tight quarters, unfriendly and loud environment, we will not return. We will continue to go to Butterfields instead, which is still our #1 breakfast place in town."}
{"text":"The food was good no complaints. The server was very good and friendly. Our food came out in a flash. This place does some volume on the weekends and they know how to treat a customer"}
{"text":"This restaurant is horrible, the management rude.  We tried to have a breakfast meeting here and were having difficulty with our seating.  When we asked to be moved to a booth that would accommodate our group, the manager came up to us and told us that if we wanted to have a meeting, that there was a library not far away that would be more appropriate.  When questioned about his suggestion and asked if he cared about our business, he looked at us and said, \"Honestly, I don't\" amidst his suggestion to take our meeting elsewhere due to their limited seating.  It was shocking to be approached by a member of their management in such a rude and unprofessional way.  Don't bother with this place as the manager clearly made it obvious that they could care less about the customers that visit here."}
{"text":"We arrived at 10:45 on a Monday morning and were seated after a 15-minute wait.  Dining room was extremely loud, so conversation was very difficult.  I enjoyed the Popeye scramble with spinach, abundant bacon, and cheese.  The hash browns were fine, but needed seasoning, and the pancakes were tasty.  My husband enjoyed the New Mexico skillet with chorizo, tomato, avocado, and cheese.  He appreciated that the hash browns in his entree were very crispy, but the eggs were not cooked over medium-well as he ordered.  Food arrived very quickly and server was efficient."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot.  I'm not big on pancakes but they were really good I had a fabulous omelette and the folks that work there were nice."}
{"text":"Maybe they were having a bad day. However, this place is average at best. The eggs were overcooked, the bacon was soggy. The coffee was great and so was the service hence the 3 stars. Based upon this visit there are just so many better breakfast places in Phoenix. This place is mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Felt like a far away gem because I do not frequent the Scottsdale area. The 45 minute wait time was well worth it this past Sunday.  The Mexican scramble was fully loaded with a bed of hash browns and that was just part of the meal because it came with pancakes. I thought I was reading the wrong menu because the price was very welcoming (under $10). The service was superb! This will definitely be my new brunch oasis."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely delicious!! We went earlier in the morning to the wait wasn't bad. We ordered our food and it was at our table in under 10 mins. I got the baked potato omelette and a side of wild berry pancakes. And that may possibly be the best choice I've made in my life. I can't wait to come here again!"}
{"text":"Very good Benedict!!!!!!!! Amazing all the way around! The fresh OJ is bomb! Coffee is exceptional!"}
{"text":"This place has it all for breakfast.  I highly recommend it.  Service is fast and friendly.  Eggs and pancakes cooked to order.  Reasonably priced!!  Yes, very much so, and you get a huge plate of food.  Consider sharing, if you can.  I had breakfast here twice the week of 07/20/15."}
{"text":"Best restaurant for breakfast.. awesome location and food is really good. Best pancakes and omelets"}
{"text":"I am from Georgia and was very surprised at how good the grits are.  They must have Georgia cooks!!!  Ali is our waitress and she was fantastic.  We will probably eat here tomorrow!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful place. I had the Swedish pancakes they were wonderful! Chewy in the middle and crispy crunchy on the outside edges. Comes with some kind of berry jelly and sprinkled with white powdered sugar. The wait staff was friendly polite and quick. The outside patio seating has these wonderful circular misters. They open up at 6:30 AM Monday through Sunday"}
{"text":"Eggs Benny was awesome... Great service and fair prices!  Fresh squeezed OJ was a bonus."}
{"text":"We had breakfast here two days in a row if that is any indication of how good the food is.  We were staying at Scottsdale Resort and I have come to realize after staying in numerous places that if you want a decent meal you do not eat hotel food.  I found out about Butters from Yelp and the good reviews and we were really happy with it.  They have great waffles, french toast, and fresh squeezed oj in a chilled glass.  They give you a nice carafe of ice water on the table.   The service is great and all food is delivered quickly."}
{"text":"Humongous omelettes. Very great service. Clean and cute decor. Try the Mexicana omelette, the green chili salsa adds a nice kick!"}
{"text":"First time here and will definitely be back when I'm in Arizona. Specialty pancakes. I had the Mexican skillet and it was amazing!! Well worth the wait."}
{"text":"i've been here a couple of times. there is always a wait for breakfast, as there are with quality breakfast places. i looked over the menu this past saturday and decided that a baked potato omelet looked fantastic. only problem is, it has bacon in it, which i can't eat. i asked the waitress if i could get it without the bacon, and add jalapenos instead and she said yes, but it'd cost me an extra 25 cents. no problem, i thought, even though we all know that the higher ticket item there is the meat. when i received my meal, i discovered bacon in it! there were minute amounts of bacon, btw, so if bacon is your thing you may want to also get a side of bacon with it. anyway, i had already eaten some of the omelet before discovering the intrusion, and i wasn't that hungry anyway, so i just ate the side of potatoes and the toast and called it good, hoping i wouldn't get sick, as that is what eating bacon does to me. thankfully, i had caught it in time, before i had accidentally eaten any.   note to any people with food allergies or special requests: this place will not make accommodations. period."}
{"text":"Classic Benny was subpar. Service was fine - forgot an order (side pancakes). I expected higher quality food. Aesthetics ok."}
{"text":"Such a good fresh breakfast. Pancakes and waffles are of course a must here. Friendly staff and service. If you're coming on a weekend be ready to wait though. Worth it!"}
{"text":"We had a fantastic experience at Butters! We went on Mother's Day at around 10am, the wait was about 40 minutes, there were donut holes and coffee for all those waiting which was super nice! They texted us when our table was ready, we actually went next door and enjoyed a cup of coffee while waiting. The food was phenomenal! Crispy bacon, amazing hash browns and the butteriest buttermilk pancakes! The banana french toast was also delicious. Even though it was insanely busy for Mother's Day, our waitress was attentive and our food came out quick! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"So yummy. The wait was long due to it being Mother's Day but I really enjoyed the coffee and pancakes. The skillet was average at best. Could have used more seasoning for sure. However, I would order the banana cream pancakes again! Service was average as well."}
{"text":"Based on the excellent (and many) reviews for Butters here on yelp, I stopped in for a rare weekday breakfast a couple weeks ago.  Since it was a weekday, we didn't experience any of the crowds and were seated right away.  The restaurant itself is nice, nothing earth shattering, but it's nicely decorated and has a lot of light.  We experienced good service and were helped quickly and the food arrived quite fast.  Speaking of food, I had one of their skillets with mushrooms and bacon.  The mushrooms were delicious, as was the bacon.  The eggs were cooked to my liking and I felt this was a very solid choice.  The Hubs had the bananas foster pancakes and LOVED it.  He gobbled up the entire plate and has talked about it a few times since, so I'd say it was a success.  I've gotta say, this is one of the best breakfast spots we've been to in awhile.  I wish it was closer to our house, but then again, the waistline might now enjoy that."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place! It's actually right down the street from where I live, so I can walk there, fill up, and then walk off everything I just ate! It's conveniently located on Hayden in the Greenbelt area, so there are lots of bike paths and wide sidewalks for families - and right near the lakes too, so you can make a great weekend morning out of going here.  Butters is part of Butterfields, so if you're familiar with their menu and service, you'll probably see the similarities. Butters does have a different sort of ambience - a bit more modern, rather than down home and cozy like Butterfields. But equally clean, with fast and friendly service and most importantly the food and presentation is fabulous. I always go for their egg white omlettes, always fluffy and healthy and lots of different side options. One of my faves though is their french toast - if I wanna indulge in something delicious, a feast for my eyes and stomach, I definitely go for their french toast.  Gotta give it a try - there's no other breakfast place I'd go to - except their sister restaurant Butterfields!  EDIT: 8/22/2014  Upped it to 5 stars because I've been here enough times as well as other breakfast places to say that this is definitely my fave. Fast service, consistent food, always delicious, friendly, and I could go on."}
{"text":"Excellent food, phenomenal service!!! This place just took one of the top spots in my fav-breakfast-place-list (if not the top one). Even though the wait to get in was 25min, our order was out quickly. The food was delicious. I ordered the baked potato omelette, and it was heavenly. Everyone in our party loved their food. I will definitely be back as many times as I can (it's a bit of a drive, but SO worth it!) If you're a \"breakfast person\"... this place is a must!"}
{"text":"After being told by our waitress when we ordered our food that my wife and I could not share a cup of hot green tea, along with the full breakfasts that we were ordering, a creeping anger took over and neither of us plans to go back.   Does that sound nuts to you? It does to us. Our waitress said, quite firmly, and backed up by management she claimed, that if we both wanted hot green tea that we had to order TWO cups. Never mind that we often share food and beverages nearly everywhere we go.   As I write this, I'm getting angry all over again. The incident happened months ago. We often drive by Butters on Hayden Road and fairly frequently we are unfondly reminded of this bazaar experience.   You say you like Butters? You can have it."}
{"text":"My cousin and I have vacationed in Arizona for years, and this was one of the best breakfasts we've had here! We got banana cream french toast and turkey bacon-the toast was thick and fluffy, the perfect sweetness, with portions so large we couldn't quite finish (although we really wished we could!!). We also ordered smoothies, which came to us already in to-go cups which was thoughtful and perfect to take with us outside into the heat. The decor is modern and funky, the service was very quick despite it being a busy morning, and the whole environment felt welcoming and fun. We would recommend Butters to anyone!!"}
{"text":"Fresh squeezed OJ is amazing, they put it in a frozen cup so the juice is ice cold! I also had the pecan waffle with banana and a side of crispy bacon, so good! Butters has so many items to choose from on the menu for breakfast, I don't think you can go wrong!"}
{"text":"BEST breakfast around!! I am not a breakfast fan but I am if I eat here. However there is always a wait, but well worth it."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Have been here a number of times with the wife  great food, wonderful service and fantastic prices.   We love the speciality pancakes but have never had a bad meal.   Line can be long especially on the weekend but they do a great job turning over tables without making people feel rushed."}
{"text":"Normally this is my go to breakfast spot. However, someone decided to change the formula that was working and switch from the fluffy, unique and delicious hash browns to the basic shredded ones I can buy at the store. It didn't go unnoticed and I won't be back unless the original hash browns come back."}
{"text":"My family and I recently went to breakfast at Butters and all I can say is 'wow'!  Even though we had to wait to be seated, the wait was well worth it. The service was quick and splendid overall.  Food was fantastic!  Excellent pancakes, coffee, juice, and delicious omelets.  We'll be back every Sunday."}
{"text":"I'm not much of a breakfast person but this was the best breakfast EVER. They whip the eggs for scrambled eggs and make them so creamy and fluffy. The wildberry pancake was sinful. My husband had the corned beef hash and thought it was delish. I was shocked at how fast service was. Good job!"}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place in Scottsdale. The New Mexico Skillet is my favorite, but everything is great on the menu."}
{"text":"I don't think you can really get breakfast \"wrong\" but there are definitely places that stand out. Butters is one of them. They have unique options (we had the salmon and cream cheese scramble and corned beef hash skillet) that you might not find elsewhere. The pancakes on the side were also great, though I'd like to come back and try some of the more unique pancake options!"}
{"text":"I love the food and the service. Can't wait to take the rest of the family - the patio will be great for the grandkids"}
{"text":"This place has excellent service! The orange juice is OUT OF THIS WORLD LIKE I WANT TO MAKEOUT WITH IT! even nice water pitchers....such variety on their menu theirs a choice for everyone even people who don't like breakfast foods normally(me). Smoking before is a great way to enhance your experience"}
{"text":"Always a pleasure supporting a family owned business ! The food is delicious - they use whole eggs ( not bagged) which makes a huge difference in taste and texture . The Eggs Bene never disappoints and the pancakes are fluffy and very tasty . YOU must order a fresh squeezed OJ . Service is good - wait is never to long . The new decor is amazing especially in the ladies room . Love the wallpaper ! Great job !!"}
{"text":"This place was so good we went 2 days in a row and ordered the very same thing!  Banana cream pancakes, cheesy bacon and potato omelette and cheesy grits.    Only a 5 minute wait on a Sunday morning and we were experiencing this deliousness!    Service was great, prompt and they refill coffee regularly.    Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch before a pre-season baseball game. I had the Wildberry Bliss Cakes... delicious! Side of scrambled eggs was a bit too runny for my personal taste. Would definitely recommend! :)"}
{"text":"Butters Pancakes & Cafe is the perfect place to come to if you're craving some good 'ole breakfast. They offer lunch, as well, but when I went I had some of their breakfast items from their menu.   I ordered an iced caramel latte along with their country benny, which is eggs benedict with sausage on a biscuit and covered in gravy. The dish comes with a pork sausage, however, I was able to swap out the pork for chicken. The chicken sausage was extremely tasty and the dish overall was very hearty. I had it with a side of home fries. You also have the option of getting grits instead.   I also tried my friend's banana cream cake (pancakes), which were to DIE FOR! Imagine a stack of pancakes with bananas, cream, and caramel all over. If you get a skillet, they're only $1 extra if you add them on. I would definitely try a stack if I were you.   There is plenty of parking near the establishment since it is located in a plaza.   I can't wait to go back here the next time I visit Arizona!   FYI - Krista was an amazing waitress! She was extremely friendly and super attentive. Ask for her next time you're there."}
{"text":"Fresh orange juice here is delicious. It's cool that you can get pancakes instead of toast with your eggs. The eggs were just ok though and this place is very busy on the weekend. Friendly staff but food isn't really special. Food is good but not amazing."}
{"text":"The best service I have had! Very quick turn around on a Saturday morning- and wonderful food! If only this place was in Wisconsin"}
{"text":"Needs work. The other location is so much better food and service wise.   The hostess has a poor personality. A bug crawling on you is friendlier.   Patio still not open   Coffee takes 15 minutes. Food bland   They need to have the cooks and servers come help from other location. That one is so much better   Guess I drive further to enjoy weekend breakfast"}
{"text":"Like I said very large servings the fresh squeezed oj was a hit the table I had a skillet with turkey bacon..the only reason I did you give 5 points was the cheesy grits for me too much cheese but still tasty"}
{"text":"Tried the Eggs Rojo and it was delicous! My daughter loved the Mickey Mouse pancake and fresh squeezed orange juice. So many delicous choices to choose from. We look forward to coming back next time we visit AZ."}
{"text":"For my first experience I give Butters Pancakes & Cafe a 5 star rating! We went as a large group (10 people) on a Sunday for brunch. It was really busy and we had to wait a little bit over an hour but after everything was done, I definitely felt that it was worth it.  Firstly, I thought our waitress did a great job the entire time we were there. She was on top of taking our orders, keeping our cups filled with drinks, etc. There was a variety of items ordered at our table and per recommendation I ordered the Wildberry Bliss Toast. It wasn't a very long wait before we got our food and everything looked awesome. After only the first bite of french toast, I was totally hooked. It was a bit sweet but not overwhelming so; the mascarpone in the middle offset some of the sweetness too and it made for some really delicious bites.  Everyone seemed really pleased with the quality and quantity of food that was served to us. I'd love to return here & bring some more friends to enjoy the deliciousness!"}
{"text":"Road our bikes from the Hyatt Gaines Scottsdale, got a good glute burn in before our killer breakfast.went here based on Yelp and local reviews, and so glad we did.   First off the coffee was off the rails good and got me jacked up like a spider monkey on Mountain Dew for my bike ride back to the resort.  As for food the protein wheat cakes with with oats and blueberries was awesome, especially with the homemade Butters Syrup (which they sell bottled for take home). The chicken sausage links were perfect as was the basted eggs and fresh squeezed orange juice. My young son went off menu and ordered chocolate chip pancakes which they gladly accommodated and nailed. My 14 year old monster of a man child ordered the eggs benny, and was so overcome with tastebuds joy, he ordered two more orders.... and yes ate everything!  When it comes to Butter's, there just ain't no utters...  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Best Breakfast in town. We drive all the way from Arrowhead Ranch for their great food."}
{"text":"The best breakfast establishment I have been to.  All the selections are cooked to perfection.  The vibe is also very inviting and everyone is happy to be there including the staff.  The food is superb and I recommend the Californian with pancakes and hash brown.  Enjoy your coffee with the locals and start your day off great.  ENJOY it as we have every time we have been here!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite breakfast places in Scottsdale. First of all if you go on the weekend or a holiday there will be a wait for a table but let me tell you, it will be worth the wait. The service is lightning fast the wait staff are friendly and it's very clean. It's a noisy restaurant but not over the top. They have a nice patio too if you like alfresco. They squeeze their own orange juice and it's wonderful although a little on the expensive side. This is the only time a drink juice so I can overlook the price for a once in a while treat. I've tried many items on the breakfast menu and I've never been disappointed. I love the Smoked Salmon Scramble and also the Santa Fe Scramble with chorizo but all their egg dishes are great. Their hash browns are outstanding, made from scratch not out of a box. Pancake lovers you're in luck as theirs are fabulous. My personal fav is the banana pancakes. They are also opened for lunch but I have never eaten here for lunch. They're lunch menu does look pretty good though."}
{"text":"I am from NY and visited the Arizona/Nevada area in Nov 2015.  I'm so glad that I found Butter's on yelp.  The food was amazing and the portions were huge!  I was there on a weekday morning and it was quite busy; maybe a 5-10 minute wait.  I only wish there was a Butter's in New York :("}
{"text":"Worth the wait on the weekends. Make sure your entire party is there when you get called or they will not seat you until everyone is ready to be seated! This is one busy place during the weekend, if you come earlier then it is easier to get a table. But be ready for a 20+ minute wait. Go to the Roastry next door and grab a cup of Joe while you wait to eat an awesome breakfast.  Menu is huge. Pancakes, skillets, orange juice (fresh squeezed and AMAZING ). Coffee is good, and the staff are super friendly and food comes out fast. Big portions, can never eat more then half."}
{"text":"This place is DELICIOUS!  I had their Whole Hog Skillet with extra ham, and their Wild Berry Cakes. Incredible.  So good.    Service is great ... the patio is great ... it's all great.  The only thing in my opinion that keeps it from being 5 stars is that you can't do a \"call-ahead\" or make reservations.  Lines can get very very long, which can be annoying.  All in all though, it's worth the wait.  ENJOY!"}
{"text":"We loved this restaurant!! I got the power pancakes and my husband got the banana cream pancakes. They were both delicious! The eggs and bacon were also good. And we absolutely loved the fresh squeezed orange juice!!!"}
{"text":"Came in with a group of 4 and the wait was about 25 mins. People leaving looked so satisfied so we decided to wait it out. Got seated and a waitress came to the table right away. Very nice and friendly. Placed our orders and only about 10 minutes later everything was out. All 4 of us were beyond satisfied. Food was amazing, the fresh juices were amazing & and service was great. Definitely my new breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"This place has been open for awhile but I hadn't gone because I didn't know the name. Tried this place for a work event and realized it is the same as Butterfield's! Same menu and some familiar faces from Butterfield's. The food is fantastic- best pancakes around (try the cinnamon roll, you won't be disappointed)! Only waited a few minutes for a table and service was good. Can imagine there would be a much longer wait or slower service on a weekend morning compared to a weekday at 10am. I'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Loved this breakfast! My mom found this place on yelp so we decided to go as a family while they were here on their vacation. The staff was so friendly and accomdating.  My mom and I split the biscuits and gravy and French toast, they were both equally delicious. The best however was my mom's latte (I think) it was heaven served in a cup. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Seriously, this by far one of the breakfast places I've ever been to. The eggs are so fresh. It's always been a wait when I've come here but that's alright with me, it's so worth it!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful breakfast yesterday.  Very clean inside, great food, very reasonable pricing and attentive service. Going back with the wife today. Yum."}
{"text":"Awesome service from Alex. Great food. My new brunch spot. Try the cinnamon pancakes! Highly recommend will eat again!"}
{"text":"Great food! Almost too much for us to eat! Fast service, clean and super busy! Always a good sign as we were from out of town. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Cute place, disappointed with menu & staff -  Waitress was not very friendly or helpful.   I have food allergies and they were NOT accommodating AT ALL. I had to practically BEG twice to get one of the staff to ask the chef if he could make me a vegan waffle.  EVENTUALLY,  I was told it was too much trouble as they premix the batter - really??!    My birthday breakfast out with my awesome friends was a side of bacon & lukewarm coffee .... the bacon was pretty tasty though!!"}
{"text":"Went to Sprint to get my frozen screen on my Samsung 7 phone fixed yesterday.   They told me they would have to send it in and it was going to cost me from between  $75 to $350 to get it fixed.  The fact that I didn't have Insurance and it's no longer under warranty was a concern.  The best thing she told me was to go try UbreakIfix.  So I did.  He checked it out and arrived at the same conclusion.   However, he decided  to try a quick straight and low and behold it worked!!!!   I was trill and think Brett is the smartest guy in Scottsdale... So, take my word for it, if you have an electronics problem,  go see Brett at \"UbreakIfix\" in the Promenade on Scottsdale Road and Frank Lloyd Wright.   He will do you right."}
{"text":"Cinnamon bun pancakes.   Delicious!!   I was going to order the Banana Creme, however I think that I made a great choice.  I'll come back again just for the pancakes."}
{"text":"Food and service was excellent! I had the minced ham and cheddar scramble. My husband had the Swedish pancakes.  Great atmosphere, friendly staff and great food.  Waitress refilled our drinks regularly. Always a good practice!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area!! The omelet was so perfectly cooked....I am still wondering how they cooked it. Fluffy eggs, awesome pancakes and perfectly portioned.   If you are anywhere near this little gem you must stop in!!"}
{"text":"This place is incredible.  It's worth the wait people.  I chose the berry pancake and egg scramble; outdoor seating.  Life is good."}
{"text":"I came here a couple weeks ago while vacationing in the area. The food was delicious and the portions were generous. Everyone was completely stuffed by the time we left. I would highly recommend for breakfast. There was a short wait but not bad and definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Have eaten at Butters many times.  Quick service and all the servers will help anyone.   Love the cheesy grits and the southwestern salad.   My daughter loves the French toast and they have great bacon.  Even though there seems to always be a wait, we normally get in pretty quick.  Will continue to eat here"}
{"text":"This place deserve 5 stars, reason good food & i love the coffee. you should try the shakes they are delicious no regrets :)  EA"}
{"text":"Squishy/soggy/slimy french toast, no substitutions without being charged, and initially seating us in the worst possible seat available (in-front of entryway/kitchen)= 2 stars.    Apparently it costs them $0.25 worth of brain power to use an alternate ingredient.  I am one of those annoying people that modifies menu items because I don't like some things that are standard to some dishes.  i.e.  avocado, sour cream, some cheeses, mayonnaise, and the list goes on...so I was not a very happy camper when I was told it was a $0.25 charge to substitute anything.  If I was still 8 years old, my breakfast would have cost me $30.  I can understand if I add something, but substitutions- that is stupid!  And according to my sister they need to change a few things with their French toast."}
{"text":"I have nooooo clue what the hype is all about with this place. There's an hour long wait to sit in what looks like a (slightly) refurbished Denny's. And the food is about the same quality as well.  To top it off, the service isn't just weak, it's downright terrible! When we were seated we waited about 10 minutes just to have our waitress come to our table, and when she got there she didn't even smile. She just said \"what do you want to drink.\" I mean, at least fake that you like your job when you have a customer-facing role.  The prices are good, but then again, nobody's going broke at Denny's, either. What I will give them the three stars for is the fact that no one in our party ordered the place's namesake. Pancakes are their thing. They had a ton of variety on the menu, and if I ever went back (not likely) I would definitely go for the pancakes. The extra star is basically just my way of giving them the benefit of the doubt. I'm so sad I didn't like this place more. Oh well."}
{"text":"This place definitely deserves five stars! The service was great and the food was phenomenal! The best omelette I've ever had! Our server Victoria did an awesome job our drinks never went unfilled and our food came out very quick. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Stopped in while on vacation in Arizona.  The food was delicious, service was excellent, and I loved the fact you could see into the kitchen.  You gotta love it when you leave a restaurant and wish you had one just like it in your own neighborhood."}
{"text":"The food was really amazing! However my waitress Jenell messed up my order and had put sausage on my plate that I did not order. When she realized her mistake, she came back with a clean plate, took my spoon and proceeded to dig through my plate to get the sausage off, to return back to the kitchen. I was completely dumbfounded by this as it was her mistake and she should have just cleared the charges of it."}
{"text":"On a recent visit to Phoenix we decided we did not want the 'included' breakfast at the hotel so we want looking - found Butters and glad we did.  There was a wait but not long and it was well worth it.  I had the french toast and eggs, all cooked perfectly.  The staff was friendly and very attentive.  Overall a great experience and I would go back."}
{"text":"This is one awesome restaurant and the food is fantastic. Today Penny and I had their Classic French Toast and a Classic Waffle. The best! Next time it's the Eggs Benedict for sure. They looked fabulous. Out of all of the \"breakfast\" restaurants we've eaten at this is by far the best in Phoenix.  They do not accept reservations so we had to wait 35 minutes to be seated, but it was well worth it.  Gluten free items on the menu which can be a challenge for breakfast dishes."}
{"text":"Great food in a nicely decorated environment. Our server was so sweet and attentive and we really enjoyed talking with the manager from Chicago.  Coffee was good breakfast was excellent and my salad had moist chicken."}
{"text":"Just visited Butters and it was just OK,  didn't really experience a \"wow factor\" as others have indicated.  Would try it again and order something less ordinary then just an omelet.  My bench mark is a place called the breakfast club in old Scottsdale. everything i have had there so far in the last year has had a \"wow factor\", try it."}
{"text":"This place was great! Its cozy and unique and we love coming here for a delicious brunch"}
{"text":"Love this place so delicious! They are always smiling and so kind to us when we come. They interact with my daughter and make us feel welcomed from the get go. Definitely a go to place!"}
{"text":"best place for a family breakfast treat . My kids love the variety of their menu .healthy ,good, not greasy portion . I love butter pancakes . Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Man do Arizonans love their breakfast! There are so many breakfast restaurants and Butters is definitely one of top places we tried. I loved that they had interesting flavors for their pancakes. It was basically dessert for breakfast. Oreo s'more pancakes? Yes! Banana cream pancakes? Yes! Service was nice and the food was great.  The menu is kind of confusing. If you order the eggs, hashbrowns, bacon, and specialty pancakes combo it comes with plenty of food. Wish they would re-write it so it's clear what you get."}
{"text":"Was visiting Arizona last week when I was searching for a place to have breakfast. Butters popped up on my google map- so I decided to try it. When we arrived, there were a bunch of people waiting outside- so I almost left, but I am glad I decided to wait it out. The hostess said it would be 15-20 minutes, and it was 15 minutes, awesome! We sat outside which was a really nice clean, quiet area. I ordered the regular pancakes- and they were amazing! I honestly never thought I would use the word amazing to describe pancakes- but they really were the best I have ever tasted! If you're ever in Arizona, I highly recommend checking this place out :)"}
{"text":"We visit each spring to catch some games and Butters is always the best place to start the day. Great service, amazing food!  So many options. Definitely worth a 10-15 minute wait.  We like the new location too. You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Visited on Sunday, 8/20/17...of course they were busy. We were told it would be 45 minutes, and our wait was 45 minutes. But as soon as we were seated and had ordered it maybe was 10 minutes and our food was served, nice and hot! I had the traditional Eggs Benedict, very good. Hollandaise sauce was nicely made. My husband had Eggs Rojo. He enjoyed the red sauce, good favor, but would like it a bit spicier, but he likes hot spicy food."}
{"text":"In an area with lots of options, where it's tough to rise to the top tier of casual breakfast restaurants, Butters has done the job of serving excellent food with fast, friendly and efficient service.  We were promptly greeted, seated and asked our beverage selections. A carafe of ice water and glasses was already on the table. Nice touch, especially when it's 100 degrees outside!  The menu has lots of great choices. The Chocolate Chip Pancakes, Protein Pancakes and the Bacon, Mushroom and Onion Skillet were all very good.  I especially liked the big glass syrup bottle on the table for all the pancake syrup you need. You can also purchase a side of real maple syrup, if you like that, for only $2.  I'm looking forward to also trying what looks like a great lunch menu also...maybe next time."}
{"text":"This places was amazing. Well worth the wait! I am from Seattle and found Butters on yelp while I was in Scottsdale. I am so glad I found it. This was the best brunch I have had in a long time. I liked that you could get coffee while waiting for your table. We had the classic eggs Benedict and strawberries and cream pancakes. Both was very delicious. I highly recommend and want to go back if I'm ever in the area."}
{"text":"Took the advice on Yelp and was not disappointed. Just excellent. I had protein power cakes - just fabulous. Could not finish the three that I was given. My husband had the California scrambler and loved it. Surroundings were great as was the service. Thanks to Yelp we had an excellent experience."}
{"text":"This is, hands down, my favorite breakfast place.   My son and I have visited Scottsdale twice now for the Spring training and have eaten here every day each time.   The food is excellent and service great.   We even got up this morning at 5:30 so we could come before our flight home.   Look forward to coming back again next year.   I highly recommend the Bliss Cake!!"}
{"text":"I always get a simple breakfast, but we love this place! Good coffee, and great food. Bit of a wait to be seated but, have coffee while you wait."}
{"text":"Consistency, never been disappointed in 20+ meals at butters. Great environment, and a great place to bring out of state visitors. Food, atmosphere, speed of service, quality of service. All 5 stars."}
{"text":"Solid good food. It's a bit commercialized, but still very good. I especially liked the cinnamon roll pancakes. I would recommend trying to go on a weekday. There will still be a wait but maybe not quite as long. The food was good but I wouldn't wait more than 1/2 hour to eat here."}
{"text":"Haven't been here for a couple years but it is as good as it was. Good portions of great food!  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Great food and great service!! So much better than the one further south! This is for sure our go-to breakfast place!"}
{"text":"One of the best Breakfast spots I've tried- food was really good. Got the hash skillet with eggs on top.  Hash is real hash with scalloped potatoes, and cheese. Accompanied with pancakes that are on point- Fresh squeezed OJ to wash it all down-  When in Scottsdale... make sure you go here!!"}
{"text":"Amazing pancakes! I don't know if they are the best ever but I know that I've never had any that were definitely better. So good. The Mexicana Omelette is my usual. Lots of flavor and pretty original. You can make that meal last all day and it's surprisingly very reasonable in price considering the zip code. Great service too. Nothing bad at all to say."}
{"text":"Bacon is thick and well done, perfection. The pancakes are so good they can be eaten without syrup. Food came out hot and done just right. There is absolutely nothing more I could ask for in a breakfast joint."}
{"text":"Honestly, I'm not sure why this place has so many good reviews. I went here Sunday morning with my girlfriend. We have been anticipating the opening of Butters because it is right across the street from us and going out for a late breakfast always makes for a good time on a lazy Sunday morning. We went around 10am and there was a 20 minute wait.  Not a big deal because I expected it.   We finally got called inside to get seated and getting to our table was like trying to find a seat on a crowded subway in Boston. This place was JAM PACKED with tables. Every seat in the place looked uncomfortable just due to the fact that the table next to you, was basically breathing down your neck.   We got sat in a booth (thank god) and took a look at the menu. We were asked, within a minute of sitting down, if we were ready to order. We said we needed some time to look, but she literally came back in less than 2 minutes to ask if we were ready again. It gave us the feeling that this place was just trying to get people in and out as fast as they could. My g/f asked what the crème anglaise was that came on the french toast. The waitress looked confused and said \"Um, I'm not sure but its like a sweet sauce\". Really?! At least offer to go find out. We rushed to decide and I ordered a veggie omelette with hash browns and pancakes and the g/f ordered the pumpkin french toast with the \"sweet sauce\" on the side.   The food came out fast but was nothing special. I took a few bites of the omelette and it was probably 90% cheese. I didn't even see a mushroom or zucchini in the few bites I took and the eggs didn't taste fresh. I pushed it aside and tried the pancakes. Maple syrup was definitely not real and the pancakes were dry and chewy. Hash browns are just hash browns. I didn't try the pumpkin french toast so I won't review it but she said it was just ok. About halfway through my omelette, the waitress puts the check on our table and says to have a great day like she was done with us. I hate when places do this.   I've literally had better breakfast and service at Denny's. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Great food and customer service! The orange juice was delicious, so good and fresh!  We all had something different and everything was super yummy.  Definitely going back the next time I'm in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"The food was not only phenomenal it was cooked to perfection and brought out in a timely manner. It was worth the trip and would come back every morning."}
{"text":"Service was amazing! Pancakes were some of the best and the atmosphere was great:) definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Just wanted to do a quick review o DC this place.. We drive by it all the time and always see the patio packed. So today we were driving  past it again and got about a block past it. Without saying anything to my girlfriend I suddenly made a U turn and I am glad I did. I figured it would be busy and it was but we gave the hostess our name and cell # and she said it would be 10 or 15 minutes and they would text when a table opened. About 8 minutes later we were in.. The menu is amazing..I wanted everything I looked at. I settled with the Banana cream pancakes and my girlfriend had the eggs Benedict. Even though the place was so busy we got our order in about 10 minutes or less.. The pancakes were amazing, they had Bananas in cream sauce and syrup with this incredible Graham cracker walnut crumbles. It was like eating dessert for breakfast. The Eggs Benedict looked amazing as well and I guess it was because my girlfriend never finishes everything on her plate but this time the plate was empty.. even all the hash browns. I can't wait to go back and try more things on the menu because they have a bunch of unique items that sound delicious. Looking at some of the other plates that passed us just made me want to try everything.. Great Job Butters.."}
{"text":"This place is soooo LIT!!! Love the pankaces super good especially the cinnamon roll ones!!! Probably a lot of calories but it's worth it!!"}
{"text":"With a name like this, you know it's got to be good. There are also zero illusions as to what ingredients may be in your delicious breakfast delights. Get out margarine, you don't even go here!  This is a favorite breakfast stop for my Phoenix friends, so on my second day in town we came here to partake. The wait was substantial, but we didn't call ahead. The food, it turned out, was well worth the wait.   Let's talk for a minute about these life-changing pancakes. You know when places offer \"specialty hotcakes\" and they're usually regular batter with junk dumped on top? That is not how it's done at Butters. Every pancake has its own signature batter recipe, in all these amazing flavors. Oreo? They bake the oreo into the pancake. They shove cream filling into the pancake. Whatever toppings you want are baked in and sprinkled on top. Like, what is this even? Heaven? That's right.   Hashbrowns were sliced up seasoned potatoes cooked to perfection, and the Irish Eggs Benny was such a brilliant idea. Nothing like corn beef on my eggs. Mmm-mmm good! Hollandaise sauce was one of the best I've ever tried, slathered liberally all over the top.    Three cheers for Butters. It's like breakfast at Grandma's house. Don't bring the diabetic grandkids. Portions are huge. Sugar and Butter reign."}
{"text":"Always worth the wait  best pancakes of my life, a lot of food for a great price, food comes out quick and I have never had a bad experience!!"}
{"text":"I heard so much rave about this place every time I went to it, it was packed so we never waited. Finally tried it and waited 45 mins to be seated.  The eggs were uncooked and plain, the hashbrowns were pretty crispy and not much taste. My boyfriends bacon could have been cooked longer and so could have my sisters Turkey bacon. People raved about the pancakes but I really wasnt impressed,  the were thin and cold and I was disappointed with the watery syrup. The service was okay. Ihop pancakes are better in my opinion.  Tmi but it hurt all 3 of our stomach's..."}
{"text":"The food is totally ok; nothing special. Listed as dog friendly, but sadly learned they're not."}
{"text":"We went to Butters on Northsight on 7/26/17. We got seated immediately when we entered. Our server acknowledged us within 2 minutes and took drink order. I ordered the cheese blintzes which were excellent. My guest ordered the bacon, mushroom and onion skillet which was excellent too. They arrived within 10 minutes of ordering. Another server brought our food out. She didn't smile and never even ask if we needed anything else. Our server was new however she was pleasant. The restaurant was clean and well maintained. We would definitely return.  The only improvement would be to have more friendly servers that smile. Also very loud inside no way to fix that problem. I would love to know where the corporate office is located and if they have more than the two locations."}
{"text":"This is a must visit in Scottsdale for breakfast. The options of pancakes is amazing and they all deliver a wonderful taste. I ordered the Oreo s'mores pancakes (delicious!). If you love chocolate these are the pancakes for you. The Belgium waffle with strawberry will never let you down. One thing that surprised me is how light and fluffy their scramble eggs taste. I love breakfast and this is a great spot to visit. I came on a Monday and they had a 45 minute wait. People love this spot! So show up ready to wait in line."}
{"text":"Deliciously simple! I had the protein pancake with berries, while taking out our newborn for he first time.  The waitress was accommodating for our car-seat and helped us get situated. The patio was full, but everything came out quickly and we enjoyed the Phoenix spring weather."}
{"text":"My wife and I recommend this place to everyone that will listen. The southern benedict is incredible, actually all the benedicts are incredible. Order the grits! They make the best grits in town, I could eat just a giant bowl of them and be content. When my picky eater toddler decided she would only eat select veggies and fruits, the staff created a fruit and veggie plate without any hesitation. They are always attentive, friendly and quick to top off your coffee, bring you a refill, and make sure that you're happy.  Get there early though, you can expect a LONG wait if you hit the weekend breakfast rush but it's entirely worth it for the meal."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Fantastic food... great price! Try the taffy apple French toast. The wait time was about 35-40 minutes for first available seating, but it was definitely worth the wait. Seriously the best French toast I have ever had!!! I also loved the corned beef hash with onions and their coffee was spot on!"}
{"text":"My wife and I are from Las Vegas. We always make it a must to stop here when we visit our Greek family in Scottsdale and Phoenix. The omelet Mexicana con chorizo, all flavors of pancakes are delicious. Can't forget to have the fresh squeezed OJ. Owners need to Franchise to Summerlin Vegas. OPA!!!"}
{"text":"Hey, they also serve lunch and that experience was just as good as breakfast. The turkey club had all the normal ingredients and included some decent turkey, crisp bacon and pretty good thicker style fries. My chicken wrap acyually could have used some bacon, but was still solid with lots of sliced chicken, lettuce, avocado and tomato I think. The honey mustard sauce which was served on the side was great for the sandwich and my upgraded sweet potato fries as well. Now we have a lunch option at Butters and at 1:30pm, guess what, no wait."}
{"text":"Can't comment on the food. Honestly, we left without eating, because we were quoted 10-15 minutes at check in plus another 5-10 minutes after we waited 20 only to wait another 20 then we just left. Now we're sitting at a nearby quality coffee shop with food less than 15 minutes later."}
{"text":"Great simple breakfast chow. Don't be afraid of the crowd. They are very fast and the wIt is worth it. Fresh squeezed orange juice is a must. Also, the potatoes are the best I've had.   My girls always get the chocolate chip waffles with strawberries and nothing is ever left."}
{"text":"The location of this restaurant is pretty prime. If you want breakfast on a Saturday or Sunday morning you may encounter a wait. The food is pretty good...not the best I've had."}
{"text":"Literally my favorite breakfast spot ever. I'd eat here every day if I could. They have the best pancakes, cheese grits, and egg scrambles!"}
{"text":"Friendly service but super loud music. The food was great and worth the 15-20 minute wait for our table.  I actually found a hair in my food as I was about to dig in. They replaced my dish right away and the manager came to drop off my plate, apologize and let me know they took it off our tab.  The freshly squeezed oj looked great and my partner's bacon waffle was amazing. Can't wait to come back and try a breakfast smoothie and a breakfast burrito. The bad: The outdoor patio with tables and chairs is ONLY a waiting area. They do not serve on the patio. WHAT?! Gotta get on that one, Butters. You have a text system to CALL PEOPLE when their table is ready, but we can't eat our meal outside? In AZ?"}
{"text":"Got steel cut oatmeal, I've had better. Eggs were good. Service was good as well. Coworker got crepe with Nutella and bananas, says it wasn't talk bad."}
{"text":"Everything was very good. the ham and cheese omelet was fluffy, pancakes were great and the grits were outstanding. Best grits he has ever had.  Our waitress,  Alex, was great. I asked for a Chai tea latte. They didn't have it on the menu. However, Alex got someone to make one and it was perfect. She was very attentive to every need we had!"}
{"text":"Definitely the most enjoyable brunch that we have had. We had to wait for 20 minutes but it is worth the wait. We were seated in a booth and our waitress (Monica) promptly took our drink orders. We got Vanilla Lattes and they were definitely tasty. We put in our order of food and I wanted to test out the service by timing from when we put in our order to when our food came out. 3 minutes and 30 seconds. I was thoroughly impressed. We got the corned hash skillet and New Mexico skillet with upgraded pancake sides of the Oreo s'mores and the wild berry bliss cakes. The skillets were very light and you are able to customize how you want your eggs cooked. The skillets were balanced well and tasty. Our pancakes were literally the fluffiest pancakes we had tasted. I definitely recommend giving the cakes of any kind a try. The wildberry bliss was our favorite because of the refreshing side of fruit. Overall we will definitely be returning to try out more :)"}
{"text":"Prey good food and arrive overall. Recommend the country bene or classic Benedict. Long wait, but worth it for the meal. Will definitely come back to try some of the other dishes."}
{"text":"The food here was absolutely delicious! And the staff was beyond excellent. I had a Nutella crêpe and my parents and Home went. The crate was made perfectly and the omelette light and fluffy. Our coffee cups were never less than half full and the staff bent over backwards to anticipate our needs. If I am ever back in the Phoenix area again this place will definitely be high on my list. I was thoroughly impressed with everything about this establishment."}
{"text":"It was ok but I expected something more extraordinary based on reviews.  The omelet was on the dry side and actually did not taste much of egg. Not sure whether they use powdered egg or what.  I cannot tolerate gluten. They had gluten-free pancakes but not a single type of GF toast.  Beware inside is quite noisy.  Fortunately we got a patio seat which was quieter even though the restaurant is on a busy street.  Well, it was quiet except for when the busboy rattled dishes in a pan directly behind my head on a regular basis.  I would not hurry back."}
{"text":"They would have gotten 5 stars if it wasn't for the hostess police giving our 6 top table away just as the rest of our entire party walked through the door (at 7:50am) (More than half of our party was here and the rest were parking... WTH?)  Anyway... Desiree our server was excellent and made our Butter's experience nice after the original \"greeting debacle\".  The service was excellent and the food good. Not sure we'll come back after the greeting as there are so many other breakfast locations to go to.  \"The Breakfast Yelper's Crew\""}
{"text":"By FAR one of the best pancakes I have every had! My husband and I came to AZ to visit and I we love brunching. They had great service, a heated patio and great food! I got the wild berry pancakes and the huevos rancheros (I believe). Both were amazing. My husband loved his food too! We would definitely go back to this restaurant when we visit again!!"}
{"text":"Great food but long waits on Sunday....but worth it!! My fave is the California scrambler with egg whites and no cheese...great post work out and right next to my gym (Eos)"}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast. Well worth the wait! Food arrived super fast..I ordered the banana & cream french toast OMG...so yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Mmmmmmmmmm, deliciously tasty food, excellent service and good fresh orange juice. Very generous portions as well I could not finish the pancakes they bring with the omelets. The atmosphere was fun and friendly and the wait was only about 15 minutes at noon on Saturday which was amazing. They do serve things quickly so its good when you're hungry you dont have to wait too long to eat. Would recommend to people visiting and who want somewhere nice, affordable and tasty to eat."}
{"text":"Fantastic experience today at Butter's!! Danny the manager was very good and listened to me after a great breakfast. Tony was our server and he was attentive, helpful and kind. The meat they use is exceptional.  I was specifically impressed by the 2 people who cleared the tables....less than 30 seconds as there were plenty of people waiting, and their efficiency was evident in how quickly they worked together. Go to Butter's....best treat on a Sunday morning!!"}
{"text":"Tried the New Mexico skillet with hash browns, scrambled eggs, and added cinnamon roll cake pancakes for $1.50. The food came out quickly which surprised me considering the wait to sit down was long. My first thought of the food was that the portions were small but I ate my words once I felt full with only half of my skillet. Everything was truly delicious for the price. I will most likely come back again!"}
{"text":"I don't eat pancakes or waffles, so if you're on the hunt for those items, disregard this review.   However, if you eat eggs, there are better breakfast places in the Valley to go for breakfast. Trust me.   The last few times we visited Butters, I've made the mistake of ordering scrambled eggs. They literally looked like a scoop of wet, yellow poo. And I'm being nice here.  These so-called \"scrambled eggs\" didn't look like real eggs at all, and because of the \"texture\"  and \"wetness\" of them, I can't imagine what in the world I was eating (or trying to eat). I had them with one of their skillet breakfasts which had onions, bacon, mushrooms and potatoes, topped with this glop of yellow, wet \"stuff\".   After vomiting violently for over two hours, I've vowed never to return to try anything else at Butters, because seriously, there's way better places for breakfast that actually use eggs that have a yolk and egg white that is visible.   The only reason I\"m giving this place 2 stars is because, like I said, people say the pancakes are good, and I'll have to take their word for it.   Sorry, Butters, but Matt's Big Breakfast, The Original Pancake House, Snooze, Scramble and a host of other breakfast hot spots have you beat. By far..."}
{"text":"I actually found this place while looking up a place that had been on a Food Network show for Phoenix (we were on vacation and trying to eat our way through the town).  It ended up that this was just minutes from our hotel and even on a MONDAY there was a wait.  That was a great sign.  We polled a few people outside about what we should get and were given some great advice.  If/when I am in Arizona again, I will go here again for sure!!!  We got a mixture of savory and sweet and it was divine!  Food Network really missed out and should have picked this place!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome place. Went when visiting the area for vacation.  Went for both lunch and breakfast then next day. Highly recommend. Certainly can't go wrong with the extremely fresh squeezed OJ either."}
{"text":"This is my second time eating at Butters. Service was attentive, price point was spot on, and the food is pretty tasty as well. I tried a specialty pancake the first time and thought it was good, but had a plain original pancake that came with my meal this visit  and thought that was The bomb. The vanilla latte was also tastefully crafted and a stand out. Future hubby doesn't like lattes and really enjoyed his caffe latte."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast stop in Scottsdale! The berry pancake platter is delicious, I'm pretty sure I got some weird looks for licking my plate! Considering it was a busy Saturday I was pleasantly surprised that we only had to wait about twenty minutes before we sat down. We also didn't have to wait long for our food and the server was very tentative. Will definitely be returning soon to try more of the menu. I can never bring myself to steer away from the pancake platters! My husband loves the omelet options and the more meat-centric options. And my son can easily polish off a waffle egg and sausage. Great family stop for a nice weekend breakfast."}
{"text":"Came here with friends. It was great service and the pancakes were delicious. The fresh squeezed orange juice was excellent.  There is an outdoor eating area that is a really nice choice."}
{"text":"Great breakfast......healthy or not so healthy you will start off your vest meal of the day.....many options to choose from.....the omlettes were huge.....pancakes awesome and the French Toast was also terrific.....the only negative was that I saw one person taking up 2 tables of four......not well planned......you cannot go wrong here.....excellent, terrific a must try...."}
{"text":"A nice breakfast place that opens early & quick service.  Clean bathrooms (thank you) The service here was amazing, everyone was working together & made sure that the coffee was always full!!! Always full meaning you probably couldn't get get half way done before someone was there ready to fill it back up & keeping it hot. Well done!  The food came out quickly. It was hot & fresh.  I got the popeye scramble with sourdough toast ($10.50) I really liked mine, the bacon was thick & tasty, the onion was flavorful.  My husband got the Mexicana omelet which after trying some of his mine tasted so plain. Lol his was amazing & full of flavor!!!! Yummmm"}
{"text":"Wow. Everything was incredible. We had a 20 minute wait for a party of two but the food was so good and plentiful. Hate to leave half of it but loved every bite"}
{"text":"Third visit was lower than second, which was lower than first.  Excellent service, but declining food quality.  Bacon was chewy, eggs ordered \"over hard\" were nearly raw in the middle.  Manager was rude to me and snapping at the help, who were doing a wonderful job.  Must have been having a very bad day.  I might try them one more time, but probably will move on to better places."}
{"text":"Honestly, the BEST place for breakfast in Scottsdale.  Been to US Egg, the Good Egg, Scramble, Breakfast Club, Cafe Aldo, Daily Dose, etc.  The others are good, don't get me wrong.  But this place is THE BEST.  If you don't want to wait, I recommend getting the food to go!  :-)"}
{"text":"Tasty pancakes, the food comes out quick and the service is stellar. Worth the wait for a table."}
{"text":"Great food.  This place has very good reviews and lives up to them.  A friend and I tried to eat here last year during spring training but were unwilling to make the 45 minute wait for a table.  This year we decided to wait it out and we're glad we did.  I had a Denver Omelette with pancakes.  Was really good.  Super fluffy omelette and hands down the best pancakes I have ever eaten.  I'm not exaggerating.  The service was very good.  Coffee cup was never empty.  My advice, make the wait if you can spare the time.  You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"With new breakfast places popping up all over the valley, Butters stands out from the rest. Can't say enough good things about this place! We typically go with friends out for breakfast after our long run on the weekend and this is always my first choice. The portions are big, their coffee is excellent and I love that they have good tasting gluten free pancakes. Great value, lots of food, and tastes great... what more can you ask for."}
{"text":"Very fresh breakfast. I ordered the New Mexico skillet with chorizo. It was so good I couldn't stop eating it. Before I knew it, I had almost finished the entire plate.  The pancakes are what they are known for. Really buttery (hense the name \"Butters\")"}
{"text":"Awesome food! Little pricey but delicious. Loved the power pancakes!"}
{"text":"Great place for fresh crisp breakfast.  Excellent service.  Had the protein pancakes which are tasty and filling."}
{"text":"This was a nice find. Food came out fairly fast. The service was also very good. The food was yummy."}
{"text":"A pretty average breakfast place, very crowded. Food and service weren't bad, just not the best ever. Next time I would check out some of the other well known breakfast places in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Had the Oreo Pancakes which were three pancakes filled with Oreos and topped with Oreos, chocolate chips, and marshmallow fluff. That was delicious, but my side of hash browns were not, they were not crispy and didn't taste very good. So I'll probably opt for eggs next time as a side. Had a bite of their half pound house burger and it was pretty good.  They have a fountain by the patio which is lovely to look at if you sit on the patio."}
{"text":"Simple choice thats always good. Love the fresh squeezed Oj. And pancakes are always fluffy! Basic breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Nice location. Great price. Good service. Wait is very long and for some reason do not accept reservations .... I mean do they really expect people to keep waiting for some fluffy eggs ??? I have ! And I'm guilty.... what can I say, it's worth it if you have nothing better to do with your time.   Btw.... I'm a very picky eater and recommend scrambled eggs for those who aren't very adventurous! My partner however recommends French toast or skillets.   DO NOT GET GRITS ! trust me !"}
{"text":"This place is great! We were seated quickly and had coffee one the table fast. Nice! After taking our order, it was about 5-10 minutes when they brought it to our table with no complications. The food was hot, fresh and very good. I had an egg white veggie omelette with feta cheese. No skimping on the egg whites! It was also very light and fluffy. The potatoes were cut in slices like you would for scalloped potatoes. They were not greasy and had a crispness on either side of the portion.  The service was very prompt and friendly. The place is very clean and somewhat simple in design. The bathroom was kept up with no tissues, etc, on the floor nor a lack of tissue and paper towels.  I would recommend to go earlier than later unless you don't mind a wait. There were several people and groups outside waiting when we left.  Returning is a given!"}
{"text":"Great food and service, but the orange juice, which everyone raves about, was sour on the day I had it.  Went with the blueberry smoothie instead.  Good stuff!"}
{"text":"First time I had eaten at Butters, and it was fantastic! My wife and I went to celebrate our 2 year marriage anniversary for breakfast and it was ligit. Customer service was amazing, and employees were very friendly. Smiling faces everywhere which was awesome! We have another favorite restaurant. Will be going back someday soon."}
{"text":"We found this place with the help of Yelp. Very good location (not far away from our hotel) and last but not least... possible to sit outside in the sun ! We went several times back, so that means a lot :) Very friendly and fast service. For us important : fresh made !  Never without coffee... Taste and quality always perfect. Price/quality OK. I recommend this place and I will come back when I'm here."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service. The fresh squeezed OJ was delicious. I enjoyed the Popeye scramble and my husband had the New Mexico skillet. Recommend both."}
{"text":"Delicious! Went for breakfast and enjoyed a great meal.  Fresh squeezed orange juice was amazing!  Best I've ever had.  My husband really enjoyed the coffee too and that is a rarity when we go out seeing as he is so picky. Food was great! No complains at all.  I was very impressed with the flavor and portion size. The only negative was the extremely long wait for a weekday morning...we were quoted 15 minutes and waited for 35.  I would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Get here early unless you don't mind waiting.  I ordered the Eggs Benedict and they were the best I've ever had! The fresh oj is good too.  The service was fast and friendly. I want to go back and try the crepes :)"}
{"text":"Best breakfast place ever! Don't miss it if you're ever in Scottsdale! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I met a friend here on Monday at 8am. The place is usually packed on the weekend, so I was expecting to wait before we got seated, however we were sat right away. We browsed the menu for a few minutes and the waitress came by to take our orders. Literally 10 minutes later, our food arrived. My food was good; honestly, being allergic to dairy, and being vegetarian, I'd have liked to see a few more choices. Maybe almond milk / coconut milk smoothies, veggie bacon, or a dairy free alternative for coffee. They can cater to the needs of a gluten free diet, so accommodate the needs of someone with a dairy allergy / vegetarian diet."}
{"text":"Large portions, perfectly cooked eggs, crispy hashbrowns, and AMAZING banana foster pancakes."}
{"text":"Go to breakfast here every morning before I go to my gym across the street.. LOVEEEEE and 100% recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"Danny, the FOH manager was so rude to a lady checking (in a walker, probably sound 70yrs old) her status on the wait time, that I had to step in and tell the Danny, that the lady understood the situation. He then immediately verbally jumped on me and started being extremely confrontational and rude. He then even said, \"oh your not talking to me now,\" because I had turned my back to him. He left and then returned wanting to bring the conversation up again. It was the most unprofessional situation that I have been a part of, and I worked in the restaurant world for 7 years."}
{"text":"This is probably the best breakfast place I have ever been to, especially in Arizona. The food is amazing & the service is great.   I have eaten here multiple times & never had anything I have not loved. The pancakes are delicious. The French toast is terrific & the eggs are amazing. I usually do not like eggs at restaurants but Butters are always cooked to perfection. The scrambled eggs are fluffy (fluffy is a good think in my opinion) & taste great.   Try the berry bliss pancakes or French toast, & the banana nut bread French toast is different but in a really good way.  Obviously, I highly recommend this place. Just go before 8 & beat the crowds."}
{"text":"I went here with my family for Mother's Day. Good food, friendly staff, just a little pricey. I recommend it and would go again."}
{"text":"If you drive by on any given day, you will see a large crowd outside Butters. Is it good? Yes it is, although it is not my favorite.  I ordered the chorizo omelette with a side of protein pancakes. Of course I loved the pancakes. The portion size of the omelette plus the pancakes was insane. I easily could have split that!"}
{"text":"We came here for the pancakes & they didn't disappoint! We tried the cinnamon roll and Oreo. Omg! They were like dessert. My favorite was the Oreo, there was actual Oreos in the pancakes! So good. The rest of the breakfast items we got were good as well."}
{"text":"Where do I start?   Well, I guess I could start by saying his place was so good that my family and I came back for days in a town and ordered the same exact orders again.   Butter's skillet are truly the best I've ever had. The skillet's base is a layer of crispy potatoes with cheese. It offers an unprecedented flavor.   We also had the same waitress two days in a row and she was a very kindhearted and attentive person. Through and through this place is a must eat at. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Tried Butters on a recent trip based on Yelp reviews.  Had breakfast here 3 days in a row and got basically the same thing since it was so good.  My wife and I split the Mexicana Omelette and upgraded the pancake to the Protein Power cakes with extra blueberries.   This is plenty of food for two small folk like us.  Had this all 3 days if that tells you anything.  The coffee is the best we have had in Phoenix over several trips.  They use a local roaster that has been around since the early 70's.  Also, the people working at this place were some of the nicest we have met.  Highly recommend Butters for breakfast."}
{"text":"So I was visiting my boyfriend in Arizona, and we were thinking of going to a restaurant somewhere. We found this place, and oh man it was pretty busy! So we waited about 15 minutes, and we were seated.   My boyfriend ordered the Mexican omelet, and I ordered a parfai. The omelet was so delicious! The parfai was pretty good too, but oh man! If he and I are in Scottsdale again, I wanna go back!"}
{"text":"Our party ordered a variety of food and we were all very happy with the quality and the service was great. Dina was very patient with 2 of the persons in our party that are always on a mission to creat their own order from a variety of things on the menu. I shared a skillet and crepe order with a friend. The crepes we very good, the skillet was good with the exception of maybe too much cheese. Overall, it is a a place worthy to return to."}
{"text":"Excellent strawberry and marscapone pancakes.  Excellent, (huge) Mexicana omelette and tasty, pan-fried hash browns. Granola breakfast sundae looked delicious (yes, I was eyeing our neighbors' table).  Coffee comes with cream (not creamer). Open, bright and comfortable setting.  Quick and courteous service.  Expect a wait if you come after 8:30am on a weekend.  Would visit again if I were in the area."}
{"text":"The banana bread French toast is worth the price of admission!! It definitely made up for some small hiccups all around.   Even at 9a, there was a 45 min wait for a party of 6. Luckily, it was a nice day and we were able to run some quick errands while we waited. I really liked how they took down your phone number and sent you a text (and called) when your table was ready instead of giving you a buzzer.  The server seemed a bit overwhelmed by all of us, and forgot a few things here and there (milk for the hot tea, a set of utensils, napkins), but she was pleasant enough. The food came out quickly and was hot and fresh. The coffee was great and she came by often to refill it.  As I mentioned, I LOVED the banana bread French toast. Literally banana bread dipped in batter, then topped with pecans and bananas. Delicious!! The eggs were fluffy but nothing remarkable. I sampled the cheese grits and they were super cheesy! I also sampled the Oreo pancakes- way too much going on there for me. Too sweet, too many toppings.  Price point was fair and I enjoyed my experience. Especially that French toast!"}
{"text":"What is not to love about Butters?   Fast service. In and out in 40 minutes, usually.   The food is great. I wish they had more veggie options, but their menu is far from disappointing.   The Two Eggs Any Style is a go-to for a nice, filling breakfast. For fancier options try any of their eggs benedict options. Terrific.  The protein power cakes and delicious!!!  The coffee. Best non-coffee shop black coffee for a dine-in breakfast joint in the area. Great compliment to the great service!"}
{"text":"This was our final meal of the trip.  My apple cinnamon French toast was one for the ages.  Very fluffy pieces of challah.  My wife had a scramble with bacon, spinach and Monterey Jack cheese, and even the toast that accompanied it was above and beyond what most places pass off as toast.  Aside from the meal being top grade, I would say that the service here should be a model for all breakfast/brunch places to follow.  This is a very popular place, apparently, and they make it look so effortless to get everyone served promptly.  We were told the wait was 10 minutes, and it was probably five or so.  There was very little wait for the food to come out, and a new iced tea was put in front of me well before I had finished the current glass.  They have a huge staff, and they are all working hard and keeping up with the deluge of customers."}
{"text":"This place is awesome for breakfast, I've come twice and first time I had Swedish pancakes, very good, my aunt ordered her fav stuffed French toast. It was Delish filled with marscapone cheese and strawberries.  The service was fast and attentive. I came back on a Saturday with my daughter , had to wait a little for a table but they were moving. We were waited on right away, drinks , food , quick but not rushed at all. Ordered the pancakes this time it was great. I can't wait for the new location to open in Scottsdale . I hope it seats more people. They are only open for breakfast and lunch . But it's is yummy for breakfast."}
{"text":"Delicious!! Three of us came for a late breakfast. Three different things- all good! My skillet was so good! Would definitely make this stop again."}
{"text":"This place is to die for! We're out of town and was looking for a great breakfast restaurant. We've used yelp every time we go to a place we're not familiar with. Yelp has not failed us. We leave happy every time. Fast service! Great waiters! Generous portions, quick service....worth the wait! Fresh queer OJ helps pass the time."}
{"text":"I've heard great reviews about this place and was really excited to check it out! I didn't get pancakes but I got their fried egg bagel sandwich and it was so good! Nothing too fancy just really good food. The place was very clean and the service was very quick and efficient. I would recommend to anyone and definitely want to go back!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure how they make their potatoes, but they are amazing. Everything we got was delicious."}
{"text":"Five gajillion stars for Butters! This place is amazeballs. Easily the best breakfast resteraunt I've been to in Arizona. The menu is ample with something for everyone, every dish is solid, and the food is all very fresh. I don't know how they get their eggs so light and fluffy, but it is so good and doesn't have that weird burnt-egg/grill-taste that a lot of other breakfast joints get.   My favorites are the skillets and the omelettes. I LOVE their crispy scallop-style potato hashbrowns, which are the definition of crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The scrambled eggs on the skillet are light, fluffy, and so delicious. The vegetable toppings are plentiful and actually fresh, with real portobello or cremini mushrooms instead of just canned or white caps. I so love that you can get sides of pancakes with your savory main dish because most places make you order a $7 \"side\" of pancakes which puts a meal at over $15 which sucks. No, Butters gets us, and you get two pancakes with your eggs. My favorite is the Cinnamon Roll pancake, which tastes exactly like a delicious warm ooey gooey cinnamon roll. I've also had the Wild Berry Bliss and Banana Cream, which are both good. The Banana Cream is probably the least exciting of all three, but the pancake base is solid so it's hard to go wrong."}
{"text":"Every time we go the food, the service, and the leadership of the establishment is top of the game.  Great food each time we go.  We need to get a Butters near Desert Ridge.  We pass by a lot of places to come see you guys.  Thanks for having the best breakfast and lunch around!"}
{"text":"This is our go to breakfast place.  Best oatmeal ever, and eggs are always cooked to perfection. The staff is always friendly and efficient. We love Butters!!!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I visited this location at noon on a Sunday and we seemed to arrive just in time, right before the lunch rush arrived! The hostess informed it would be about a 30-45 min wait, which we didn't mind. Great news is we were sat within 20 mins!   We were sat down and waited on immediately by our waitress who asked for our drink order. Very shortly after, we were asked to move to a booth which I was not mad about at all! I prefer booths, and I don't mind moving to help other get seated quickly!  I ordered the HMOP skillet without cheese (I'm lactose intolerant) with two sunny side up eggs and upgraded the pancakes to the infamous and highly spoken about Oreo Pancakes! My fiancé ordered the Denver Omelette with egg whites and upgraded to Chocolate Chip pancakes.   We were expecting to be waiting for quite some time for our food to be cooked and prepared, especially because the place was quite busy! But to our very surprise our food was out within 15 mins!   Our pancakes looked a little smaller than we expected but since they came with our skillet and omelette that explained why they weren't big. We were not complaining at all!! They were actually the perfect amount and size considering we had another plate of food!  My fiancé's omelette looked amazing and I captured a picture of the perfectly melted cheese which he ordered the jalapeño cheese. He said that it wasn't too spicy and was delicious. His pancakes were super fluffy and had chocolate chips inside!  My skillet came with potatoes on the bottom (they were nice and crispy and brown) ham, mushrooms, and onions with two sunny side up eggs. The oozing yolk all over my potatoes and made for a tasty skillet!    Now the moment I had been waiting for and was most excited to try were the Oreo Pancakes!! They were delicious! Nice and fluffy with Oreo cookie pieces inside, topped with marshmallow type whipping creme, chocolate chips, pieces of Oreo and drizzled with chocolate syrup. These pancakes need no syrup! They were the perfect amount of sweetness and syrup would have only taken away from the flavor!    The service here is GREAT!! They're attentive and quick!   I would highly recommend this place for a flavorful breakfast/brunch!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place! I will comeback for sure,  it was a 35 min wait to get a table in a Saturday morning but totally worth it!! Those pancakes mmmmmm"}
{"text":"I normally don't eat breakfast but my God was this place amazing! If I'm going out for breakfast then I'm coming here! I had the cinnamon roll pancakes with a sausage and gravy bowl. It was out of this world good, the service was great but you do get a sense of being rushed out. Understandably though because there is literally people waiting all over the place. We had an hour and 45 minute wait over the weekend. It was great food though. They text you when your table is ready so you can walk around or go do something as long as your back in the allotted time before your table is given away. Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Sunday morning expect a long wait (45 minutes)  The scrambled eggs were foamy and lacked any taste that resembled eggs,  The pancakes were well,  lets just say I have had better- syrup was very good and could add flavor where the pancakes were lacking  The chicken sausages and potatoes were very good. The portions and dishes are big however, the tables are small. The servicer was excellent!   I ate indoors during winter and the constant in and out of waiters from the patio certainly gapped the difference in air environment  to match  the out door temperature.   The indoor cafe provides a cozy setting but can be restricting  to a larger framed person.   If your looking for a decent breakfast, have time to spare and enjoy a cozy envirinment don't hesitate - and during your wait you can catch up on your reading while waiting for the efficent app to notify you of your position in line."}
{"text":"I love pancakes, always on the look out for the best. Well, Butters pancakes, in my opinion are very average. I ordered the pecan pancakes and all I got was a couple of average pancakes and some pecans thrown on top. I had a basic eggs and bacon breakfast with hash browns. The hash browns were a real dissapointment. Bottom line not worth the effort or price. Cracker Barrel is much better than this place."}
{"text":"Hostess taking our name on Saturday 3/17/18 was rude.  We left.  As I stepped up to the counter where they take your name, phone number, etc. I could see that the hostess was saying something.  But the restaurant was noisy (it was very busy) and I couldn't hear a word she was saying.  So I asked her to repeat.  I tilted my head so that my hearing aid was best aligned to hear her.  Again, I could tell she was saying something, but I swear she spoke with an even softer voice than the first time.  With an apologetic smile I again asked here to repeat herself.  That's when she rolled her eyes as if my request annoyed her.  She never smiled.  She did not make me feel welcomed.  We left... never to return to Butters."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time and it was delicious. We were tired of the same old places and looked up some options on Yelp. Traveled to Scottsdale from east Mesa and it was worth it. The staff was friendly, the service was great, food came out much quicker than expected. The cinnamon roll pancakes and the Wild Berry pancakes are yummy! Hash browns were very good as well. The eggs in the skillet and omelet were light and fluffy and my 1 year old son enjoyed the French toast sticks. Total came out to $34 for the 3 of us, very reasonable. We will be coming back again."}
{"text":"Service was extremely fast. I went on Mother's Day. The food was so amazing, I would go back over And over again.! Ultimate favorite, just far from where i live. Sooooo Good!"}
{"text":"Very good food,  fast service, and our server was really attentive.  I would definitely recommend and go back."}
{"text":"*Disclaimer. If you are my future cardiologist please avert your eyes toward a different review*  Oh my dearest butters, you had me at your name, and I was oh so glad your food didn't disappoint. I'm sure this is in direct correlation toward your namesake being a main ingredient in all your dishes. Well, before I dive into how great the food is (so great by the way), let me get the frivolous details out of the way. First off, the interior is light and fun, the staff is great- couldn't be more on point, and the patio is large and dog friendly. Occasionally there can be a bit of a wait, so if you happen to go at primetime on a weekend don't be tempted to leave, they have no problem with you popping over to the Village Coffee Roastery for a one of the best lattes in town  (but that's a different review for a different time).   Ok, now down to business. I have eaten breakfast at Butters four times now and it's been a home run each time. In fact I've even turned other breakfast loyalists toward Butters for their new favorite spots. Whatever you order it comes out fast and hot. Lately I have been partial to the California scramble- eggs, grilled chicken, avocado, and cheddar. Other greats are the omelets- full of goodness and as big as your face. Even the traditionals (eggs benedict, biscuits and gravy, or breakfast burritos) hold their own as well. And the coup de grâce, almost all the egg dishes come with your choice of pancakes!! Yes, you heard me right. Or you can even sub for French toast or a waffle. All of which are light and fluffy to perfection.   Long story short, if you like breakfast, this is your spot. Just bring your appetite cuz you're going to need it."}
{"text":"Great food and price! Got a savory and sweet breakfast mix and had enough to bring home for breakfast the next day!"}
{"text":"The Berry Bliss pancakes were AMAZING!! Overall the other food was ok, the eggs were to order, the bacon a little over done and rubbery, the grits....that was not grits. That was heavy cream and butter with a sprinkle of a grit like substance on top. DO NOT BE AFRAID OF GRITS!!!! My husbands corn beef and hash was \"ok\" when asked. No details further than that.... The waitstaff was friendly-ish, but completely dumbstruck when my husband asked for just the cornbeef and hash, no extras. She asked him about a dozen times, in a dozen ways, \"Just cornbeef? Do you want the hashbrowns?' -.- Go for the pancakes for sure, those are amazing. Next time, trying the french toast!!"}
{"text":"You must go here. The food is amazing and the service is great. Our waitress, Halle, was funny and very knowledgeable of the menu and food.  Went here on a busy morning, but were seated within 15 minutes. Despite being so busy, Halle kept coming back to us to check on us. After we ordered, our food came out really quick!   The restaurant is clean and bright. Can't wait to come back when I'm in town next!"}
{"text":"Seriously, BUTTERS is one of the best breakfast spots my ass has ever been to, easily. Got there on a Friday and it was packed, imagine the weekends are crazy x 10. Got in and checked the menu.   I ordered the banana creme cakes, and it was the best pancake I've ever had by a country mile. Thick and fluffy cakes topped with bananas, graham cracker crumbs and a creme sauce. About two-thirds a way into it, I thought to myself, \"damn, self, you didn't even put syrup on this.\" Didn't need it. It was so outstanding, I'm thinking about my next trip to Scottsdale already.   A breakfast game changer.   A+, 5 stars."}
{"text":"About 1 out of 10 Breakfast spots really impress me! I was pleased to finally find one this morning! Butters fit the bill for me! With that said, I qualify myself as a discerning reviewer. I grew up in the restaurant business and currently manage my parents restaurant in Durango. I have flipped more eggs in my life than I care to think about. This has made me so picky about my eggs.   Back to Butters....  Being a Saturday there was a substantial wait. Greeted by nice staff ..we decided to hold out and wait after one of the staff (maybe a manager/owner) said that they get food out fast.  I can respect that.   Our waitress was very sweet when we were finally seated and prompt despite a 20 top she was working on. Coffee was delish!! We were very excited for the fresh squeezed OJ - yuuuuum! I had a skillet and was elated to see 2 beautiful over easy eggs. Not a touch of brown! Clearly they cook these in a fry pan and NOT on the grill (the best way!). They were beautiful. There's only about 2 restaurants a year that get this right! Thumbs up! The corn tortillas were also very delicious!  The staff hustled and was efficient! Our food came out about 6 minutes after placing our order (as promised)! Great presentation and tasted even better. The bathrooms and entire restaurant were very clean (another biggie for me).   Thank you for caring about what you do, Butters! It shows! For our last meal on our way out of town, I couldn't have been more pleased! We'll surely be back during our next visit to the area. We just happened to stumble on this place and so glad we did. From one restaurant-er to another - well done!"}
{"text":"Just last week a tourist that was in the same meeting as mine raved about his breakfast here one morning.  I had not heard of the place but decided to take my brother there who was in town for the weekend.  Ok, we get there and find out that they are a hot spot.  We arrived around 10 am and had to check in with the hostess, were given a light up vibrating table ready device.    The predicted 20 minute wait was accurate.    1 star for nice food, but not the great to die for pancakes we had heard about 1 star for nice service, no pressure to rush, well managed. 1 star for meeting our breakfast needs with a nice ample breakfast menu.  But I have to say my guest said it well - \" this is not much different than The Good Egg or any other breakfast chain.\"  I think he was right.  Next time we will stay downtown and head over to Matt's big breakfast.  PS:  the place is huge for a breakfast joint - indoor and outdoor patios.  Expect lines on a Saturday."}
{"text":"Friends like this little chain of restaurants so I accompany them a couple of times each year. The last time I had a Thai chicken salad which was pretty good. This time I had a ham and cheese sandwich which was ok.  I haven't had breakfast here.  The service is friendly and efficient. The prices are typical of this area.  All of their restaurants are always busy which tells you something."}
{"text":"This is a sister restaurant to Butterfields which is a few miles away. We discovered it when we couldn't get into Butterfields.  You would think they would be the same and there are similarities but I like this one better. The pancakes and egg dishes are similar and better than most. Service is good. The wait is still an issue but waiting area outside is a little more comfortable. This also feels more like a neighborhood or locals place. It is our favorite for a regular Sunday morning breakfast."}
{"text":"So yum! There were 5 of us for breakfast and all of us loved what we ordered. Not a single negative about of any of it."}
{"text":"Fabulous food and attentive staff. When our order wasn't quite right, it was gladly replaced with a 10% discount. Impressive."}
{"text":"Butters was phenomenal with there food and our waitress she was so sweet and kind. My only issue with Butters is they will not seat you until your whole party is present. They did not advise us when I put our name on the waitlist. We were a party of 3 with 2 out of the 3 present, we were told they could no seat us until our third person was present. I was a little peeved with this, but we soon changed to a just 2 because our third was running late. So that is why the 4 stars, if the hostess would've said at the beginning that the whole party must be present to be seated I would have re-evaluated and said we were a party of 2 originally. Be mindful when coming here, otherwise the food is very very good and patio seating was great!"}
{"text":"I seriously may move to Scottsdale Arizona so I can eat at butters everyday.... This place rocks in so many ways... Fresh OJ (not the murderer), fluffy  omelettes with chorizo and green chile sauce...Homemade stuffed  pancakes... Corn beef hash... Egg scramblers... Skillets... Beautiful employees... Clean tables.. It's like I died and went to breakfast heaven. Seriously, no negatives here."}
{"text":"Very quick service which is a huge plus. Exceptional value    The omelet was huge and fluffy.   The protein pancakes were a little dry.   But the hash brown potato was AMAZING. I usually don't like the sliced style hash as they tend to be greasy. I have been to the other location and they were super greasy. Here there was the absolute correct about of moist to crisp ratio. The person running the grill this morning was on their game"}
{"text":"everything was actually very good. didn't get 4 stars because it was a little pricey for what it was.  I mean really, you're a breakfast place with amazing pancakes and waffles and you charge $1.25 extra (and yes, they're already overpriced) for \"real\" Vermont maple syrup. well, I went for it and was shocked when they brought out a 1.5 oz pre-packaged cup, like a coffee creamer container! and $3.75 for a side of bacon that was only 3 pieces."}
{"text":"Amaze balls! Definitely a cheat day worthy breakfast. Everything is so fresh and give you that home made feel in grandmas kitchen. Service is friendly but could take it up a couple notches. I eat here all the time."}
{"text":"Came in town to visit my sister and this place had 4.5 stars rating. It was for a reason. The pancakes were REALLLY good. We both got skillets which come with 2 pancakes and we both really enjoyed them. The hashbrowns were the base of the skillets and were perfectly made, not too greasy like most. I got the chocolate chip pancakes as an upgrade from the traditional buttermilk pancakes and they came with chocolate chips inside and on top kf the top pancake. Surprisingly it wasnt an overkill. The amount of chocolate chips inside the pancake was just right - some bites had chips some didnt. I also am obsessed with juice so I of course got the OJ which was fresh squeezed and noticeable at the first sip."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is fire! The pancakes here were so good, and the options were plenty, there is no wrong way around it.   We started things off with some natural juices (orange/grapefruit), and got some coffee. We got eggs, hash browns (very clever recipe), some omelettes and pancakes. Everything was really good. If there is one stop you need to make, make it Butters."}
{"text":"I can't review the food since we didn't stay to eat.  We went to butters for to see Willie our favorite waiter. The restaurant was about 1/2 full at the time. We requested to sit with Willie,  the hostess informed us his section was full. I asked to be seated in a different section but still have Willie as our server. Her response \" I can't do that I am not allowed\" Ok we will wait after about 10 minutes of waiting we were deciding where else to go.  The hostess watched us walk out.  Why would you allow paying customers to walk out of your establishment when your not busy?  The best part is that Willie came to try and get us to sit with another server but we came just to see him.  Now, if only one server has a full station and customers are requesting to be served by him, doesn't that speak volumes?"}
{"text":"This place is perfect for breakfast. It was 75 degrees that day and we just finished hiking Tom's Thumb so we opted to continue to get fresh air and sat outside. They have good music playing and even though you are looking out to a parking lot the scenery is well kept and pleasant.   My wife (it was her birthday and she chose this place) ordered the Taffy Apple Toast with a side of real maple syrup (extra $2). It's french toast with cinnamon-apples, caramel & pecans.  She was really pleased with her dish even though she  doesn't like french toast all that much. Something about the combination of apples, caramel and pecans is just too hard to pass up.   I ordered the wildberry bliss pancakes. I have always enjoyed pancakes as my carb of choice when i have a sweet tooth. It was 3 pancakes stuffed with blueberries, layered with vanilla mascarpone,topped with vanilla cream, and fresh wildberries & glaze to go on top. The layers of mascarpone cut the sweetness with a little but of savory and richness. Great combination with the tart fruitiness of fresh berries. It was very well executed!   This will be our new go-to place for breakfast while in Scottsdale. Can't wait to try their savory options. Also with tax and tip everything was under $30. Not too shabby for a birthday breakfast for my lady!"}
{"text":"Great food  No matter what day or time of the morning, always a wait   Doesn't anyone in this town wok anymore?"}
{"text":"Good food and good service. They can usually seat you in an reasonable amount of time. You can find inside of outside. Fresh squeezed orange juice us a must."}
{"text":"Have been to Butters at this location twice now. I have always ordered their buttermilk pancakes. I guess I'm a pancake kind of guy but, I just happen to really like their buttermilk pancakes and their service is great as well. Since I have not tried other items on their menu I can only give them a four star rating. Let it be known that this is based on their pancakes."}
{"text":"Best pancakes in Phoenix! I got the wild berry bliss pancakes and my husband got the cinnamon banana pancakes! The New Mexico skillet was flavorful. Yum!!"}
{"text":"So yummy. One of the best places I've been to for brunch. Sitting outside was really nice as well! The skillet was great"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great location. There is always a wait because it's packed but we have never waited more than 10 minutes. They are super efficient and get people in and out without making you feel rushed. Our waitresses have always been attentive and very polite. The food is great. We love the cinnamon roll pancake and oatmeal bowl with fresh berries. It's nice to sit out on the patio under the umbrellas."}
{"text":"I go to butters at least once a week. Butters ALWAYS gets my food out within 10 minutes and it's ALWAYS delish. If it wasn't 30 minutes from my house, i'd go to Butters every morning. First, the eggs are absolutely unreal; heart eyes forsure. The protein pancakes are amazing and so is the turkey bacon, I get the same meal every time and it never disappoints. I couldn't imagine all the other dishes Butters has, tasting less than perfect!   The only downfall would be their policy on dogs, and how they aren't allowed on the patio!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant for breakfast or brunch. Their pancakes are well worth the calories. The presentation is great, but the taste is better. A must when in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"We've been visiting old town Scottsdale, staying in this posh apartment. A staff member suggested we drive to breakfast, versus staying around town, because the food is better. So we did and had to wait for a table. Thus place is busy, which is a good sign. The food was good, yes, but our server was exceptional to say the least. Antonio was on point our entire experience- great personality,  intuitive, always had coffee coming, and never seemed rushed. Impressive.  I'm a server and I was blown away. Right on,  Antonio! Give this guy a raise, covered parking spot, and some mad respect."}
{"text":"\"Will I eventually get to South Park if I follow this road?\"  Oh wait, wrong Butters (sorry, I couldn't help myself).  That said, young Mr Stotch would likely be pretty happy about this Scottsdale restaurant that carries his namesake.  Opened in 2009 (and now with a second location in north Scottsdale), Butters is a popular and mostly traditional breakfast and lunch spot that I had my eye on for awhile.  Knowing that the crowds here are huge on the weekends, I decided to make a go of breakfast here right at opening bell on a Saturday.  Located on the northwest corner of Hayden & Via de Ventura, Butters' flagship location occupies a crowded strip center alongside other restaurants such as Grassroots, Zipps, Twisted Grove, and Tandoori Times.  There's seating for at least 100 here, but even at opening bell, the place filled up super quickly.  I was able to grab a table near the front before the queue started forming shortly after 7:30am.  The aesthetics of the restaurant are pleasant but nothing special.  Booths for some, tables for others, fairly basic decor on the walls.  Even the patio setup outside is fairly modest.  Looking over the reviews, their website, and the menu itself, it was hard to find any one dish that stood out as a crowd favorite (pretty much all of them had universal praise).  So I hedged my bets on a couple of items.  One item prominently mentioned on Butters' website was their Eggs Verde.  A corn tortilla topped with black beans, two eggs of your style choice, jack cheese, and green chiles.  Also comes with a side of either potatoes or grits (potatoes for me).  Since this is Butters \"Pancakes\" I of course needed to add some flapjacks to the repertoire.  I love cinnamon rolls so a side order of Cinnamon Roll Pancakes it was.  And a glass of their fresh squeezed orange juice to wash it all down.  Total cost for the food and drink plus tax and tip came to about $25.  I will concur with the masses that the OJ is indeed fresh and delicious, so yes by all means grab yourself a glass of this for breakfast next time you're here.  How about the pancakes?  Let's just say I didn't leave a trace of that sugary icing on the plate.  Two pancakes with a cinnamon swirl and a VERY liberal amount of sugary icing on top and on the sides.  My only regret with this dish is that I should've asked for a full order of three instead of the side order of two.  Lordy, was this delish.  Let's talk about the Eggs Verde.  I liked the potatoes and the main dish was a very healthy portion.  But honestly, the flavors were a little flat.  Part of that was probably my fault as I should've spent the extra $2 for the addition of chorizo sausage, which definitely would've helped.  But also I just didn't pick up much flavor from the chiles or the cheese.  The dish itself is priced well for the amount of food you get, but without the chorizo it just didn't do anything for me.  All in all, I can see why Butters is a popular Scottsdale go to for breakfast.  With items like pancakes, crepes, skillets, omelettes, french toast and waffles, and lots of healthy options as well, Butters has something for everyone.  Get there early to avoid the lines if you can, and whatever you do, don't skip the pancakes.  \"Do you know what I am saying?\"  Sorry, wrong Butters again."}
{"text":"Amazing!! I got the eggs Benedict with grits. Best grits I've ever had!! And then the pancakes were to die for. My boyfriend got the Mexican breakfast burrito and it was equally as good! Definitely  coming back!"}
{"text":"Somewhat a bit of disappointment after reading all the positive reviews.  Breakfast was average....nothing special.  Service was friendly.  Hubby ordered the banana nut French toast with a side of bacon.  Banana nut bread dipped in egg and grilled.  I think the problem may have been the bread had not been cooked long enough as the texture was a bit on the gummy side.  Unfortunately, this was too sweet for our taste.  I had the corn beef hash skillet.  Corn beef hash served on top of hash browns topped with melted cheese and 2 eggs.  This is served with your choice of toast or pancakes.  I opted for the pancakes since toast is toast.  What can you do to toast other than burn it?!?  The corn beef hash was okay and the hash browns were crisp as requested.  Pancakes were decent, but I have tasted lighter and better elsewhere.    Not worth a special trip, but if in the area, it is an okay choice."}
{"text":"Love this breakfast restaurant. The eggs are always fluffy and tasty and the waffles are great. Only bummer is the wait:("}
{"text":"My friend brought me here for a birthday brunch after our hike. It was busy even on a Thursday mid morning! But well worth the wait. Very nice patio, good location right on Via De Ventura and Hayden.   Parking can be difficult if really busy and surrounding restaurants are too.   I had the salmon scramble - deeeeelicious. It comes with a side and you upgrade to one of their signature pancakes: do it. I had the Oreo pancake, to die for! Also depends on the mood you're in and how hungry. Scramble plus the two pancakes was a hefty amount of food. Very good."}
{"text":"Super impressed with the Gluten Free options here! Very safe for allergies and sensitivities, there are many dishes here that all taste amazing! The food came out super quick and was delicious. Thank you! We will be back!"}
{"text":"If you like runny eggs, uncooked ham and frozen hash browns, you'll love the \"Home of the Breakfast Explosion\".  I ordered their Benedict and a side of pancakes, and what I got was something that anyone could slap together without attention to detail.  It is beyond me why this is on the menu if you just can't cook it!  To be fair, and the only reason this noisy, poorly ventilated place did not get a single star was because our waitress was just so nice to us, trying to compensate for a crew that should just stick to pancakes, waffles and french toast.  Special tip: if you're coming here, keep the ordering to just waffles and french toast; get your coffee at the Coffee Roaster next door and you'll survive."}
{"text":"Love this place. You should probably be prepared to wait because its very popular. But its such a beautiful outdoor area with a fountain that you dont mind.  They have a great menu. We chose a veggie omelet with hash browns, pancakes and bacon. It took no time at all for the food to come out and it was all amazing.  The omelet was big and so fluffy. Perfect veggies. Hash browns were really more like american fries and were good. Bacon was cooked perfectly. And the pancakes were also great.  Anxious to return and try more. One of my new favorite breakfast places now!"}
{"text":"A must try! Delish!Visiting from San Francisco with my family, 4 kids aged 9-13 all raved. We are accustomed to foodie level meals, and this rates very high. From the Irish Benes, pancakes, Mexi-style omelette, and yes, that fresh OJ. 12 thumbs up from us!"}
{"text":"Excellent brunch and lattes. Great service and very reasonable price. Their plates are large. Two people can share. No wonder it has so many reviews. Love this place."}
{"text":"Absolutely stellar. Tremendously friendly. Very giving as well. They offer to fill up my coffee a half a dozen times when I go. They set the bar extremely high."}
{"text":"It makes me feel so special when places know me by name... or know my to-go order when I call. (I may or may not have gotten addicted to Butter's, and been in quite a few times this past week.) Yup, I've become a \"regular\". But you know what? I'm okay with it. Why? Well, have you been?! The food is spectacular! And the atmosphere is so homey and welcoming. The staff is bright-eyed and bushy-tailed every morning and greet you with a genuine smile when you walk in the door... no grumpy people here, my friends! Such a breath of fresh air, I tell ya!   Like I said, I've mostly stopped in just to grab my called-in to-go order but it doesn't make the food any less yummy. Typically I get their pancakes... welcome to fluffy pancake heaven! The classic buttermilk ones are so good; tastes like mom or grandma made them... or the Wildberry Bliss Pancakes -- pure bliss. My absolute favorite ones, however, are the Protein Power Cakes. I opt to get them without butter and no syrup or anything (yea, I like them like that, plain) because they have granola and also come topped with blueberries and almonds which makes them subtly sweet without that sugar rush; absolute perfection! Oh, and their pancakes go hand-in-hand with a side of bacon, or turkey bacon... just sayin'. You're welcome.  Their omelets and scrambles are hearty and very filling -- I suggest ordering one if you're extremely hungry (my personal fave is the California Scramble); it will hit the spot, promise! And it comes with either grits or their amazing potatoes (I always get their hash-browns which are cut like scalloped potatoes and oh-so-yummy and crunchy), and a side of toast or pancakes! Win-win, if you ask me. Hearty meal with pancakes or toast as a treat after eating your meal?! Yes, please!!!   I have yet to go and dine-in at Butter's 'cause I'm always on the run, but I plan on taking the time to dine-in soon and try their Banana Nut Bread Toast -- looks sinfully delicious. And their other menu items sound incredibly mouth-watering, too. Butter's has a customer for life, 'cause, you know I gotta try every item on their menu once... or twice... or a bunch of times.   The food is prepared hot and fresh and only takes about 10-15 minutes, so if you're reading this and getting hangry, drive over to a Butter's (yes, there's more than one location), and order some great food (or call it in and have it ready by the time you get there! Genius)! They definitely will have something on their menu to satiate your hunger and satisfy any craving you may be having! Trust me, it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Yum! Definitely a solid breakfast joint. Love that they offer a side of pancakes with your meal instead of toast. I got a veggie omelet. The hashbrowns come out nice and fluffly yet crispy. They did everything in accordance to my request with such great service.  The pancake was actually very delicious. The wait was a bit long and they do not have a bar, which we usually prefer at breakfast joints. That was the only downfall for sure.   If we're ever in the area, we'd definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place has to be the best breakfast restaurant out there. The wait time to be seated was really long but it was worth it. I had one of the breakfast burritos and it was delicious. I had the vanilla latte it was great i highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I'm pleasantly pleased with the consistent friendliness of the staff here. I typically call ahead, get exactly what I order and with a smile on top of it. Thank you."}
{"text":"I love this place. Decided to stop in here instead of the hotel breakfast. Very smart idea. Already had a bustling crowd at 8 o'clock on a Sunday morning. Had the cinnamon swirl pancakes with the California scrambler. I highly recommend. Extra bonus: the waitstaff is young and very attractive!"}
{"text":"We were torn between Butters and Butterfields (based on yelp reviews). Very pleased with our choice to go to Butters Pancakes & Cafe'! Everything looked so good that we ended up ordering 3 entrees. The salmon/cream cheese scramble, eggs rojo and strawberry cheesecake French toast (AMAZING!!!). Everything was delicious and well priced. Also really enjoyed the outdoor seating!"}
{"text":"Nice breakfast spot..  same as butterfields.. love the eggs verdes... good meats, good coffee and good service"}
{"text":"This is one of the best breakfast restaurants ever. Service is outstanding, staff is friendly, excellent quality of food and endless choices. Have had several items on the menu and each was outstanding. The only problem is that as you might expect they are very busy but they manage wait times well. Will always come here when in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"There's a very good reason we had a 25 minute wait on a Saturday afternoon..... Food is phenomenal!! My fiancé and I went with another married couple and we were all just so happy with everything that we ordered. I ordered the veggie omelet with feta cheese... NOM NOM NOM. Literally just melted in my mouth. Delicious food for reasonable prices. We are now an easy bike ride and I see Butters being a normal spot for lazy weekends :)"}
{"text":"A total surprise.  My assistant had an early morning fasting doctor's appointment so after I picked up we spotted Butters. Hoping it was better than a Dennys we stopped. What a surprise. The interior is lovely in a modern minimalistic way. The menu offer an extensive variety of options. We were both delighted. I will definitely have to take my wife there for crepes  Another return for a Sunday brunch. It gets busy early but the wait was just a few minutes. The French Toast and crepes-were sublime. We recommend Wildberries."}
{"text":"Very tasty. Great fast service. Super clean. I had a skillet with banana pancakes, bf had eggs Benedict with banana French toast. Loved all of it. Fresh squeezed orange juice was delicious."}
{"text":"Spring training has been an annual ritual for \"the boys\" over the past decade - with a big concern always being where we should eat.  Yelp helps us - and we found this place well-reviewed, and decided to give it a try before watching the Cubbies lose to the hated, dreadful Padres.  Despite a slow start on last Saturday morning (we sat without service for about 10 minutes after the hostess seated us), this breakfast spot proved pretty much irresistible - great, light and fluffy eggs, simply amazingly light, non-greasy \"loaded\" hash browns (onions, peppers and a drizzle of cheese), pancakes that I would positively abuse if they were available to me on a daily basis, heavenly french toast with apples and pecan ... oh my my!!  (If only my eggs had been hotter when served, it would have been perfect.)  Clean, bright, kid-friendly restaurant, with the kitchen concealed with camouflage curtains (hiding the help?).  Once past the poor start, service was great  - prompt coffee refills and inquiries, water in a plastic carafe on the table, sugar-free syrup available at no charge (and yes, the menu does list 100% real maple syrup for a small extra charge - but the \"premium\", private label bottle on the table was great, too).  Great omelets, interesting combos, fresh squeezed OJ.  Friendly staff.  Decent, appropriate portions.  Everything tasty.    In short, everything you'd want for breakfast.  We'll be coming back next spring training trip!"}
{"text":"Always consistently excellent.  The menu is creative.  The food is excellent.  The service is great.  This is one of the best breakfast places anywhere."}
{"text":"I was so excited to eat breakfast here. My husband kept trying to change plans, but Im glad I talked him into this place because it did not disappoint! It is not easy finding gluten-free options for breakfast, especially when I don't eat eggs either... I ordered a hot chocolate and the gf Belgium waffle  and my husband ordered a skillet with pancakes. My waffle did not look gluten-free; it looked delicious; it tasted delicious! it was amazing and my husband even thought the same. They make their own gluten-free flour blend using rice flour. Afterwards I ordered a berry and banana smoothie to go which is not on the menu, but they did it and it was delicious as well! Great friendly and speedy service. They were pretty busy for Thursday morning!"}
{"text":"There is no better way to start your  vacation day but with a really good breakfast.  It was great to see creative breakfast choices on the menu! The food was on point!  Restaurant setting was clean, Airy and bright. The service was good and Unpretentious.   Looking forward to another breakfast during my next visit."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, butters is fine nothing too great or out of the ordinary. Good pancakes, eggs are just ehhh ok? But my question is why would you go to butters when there is a local mom and pop establishment right across the street called Desert Rays Cafe that has a changing menu, awesome specials, and creative and delicious dishes. I've been coming here since it's opened and tried butters once in that time. Desert rays is infinitely better, not saying you won't enjoy butters but when this place is right across the street and has much more unique and flavorful breakfast, it's hard for me to understand why it's not the obvious first choice. Wherever you go, enjoy your breakfast!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were vacationing in the Scottsdale area and gave this place a try for breakfast  .. we were impressed and enjoyed everything we ordered .. I ordered the Nutella French toast and my husband ordered the scrambler with onions bacon and spinach with hash browns and side of pancakes .. would definitely come back and would recommend  this place to others !"}
{"text":"Love the positive energy, vibe and decor upon walking into the restaurant. The orange colored theme is refreshing and the decor wakes you up (espresso machine, coffee beans, syrup, etc.)   The menu has a large variety to choose from. I had the chorizo breakfast burrito and my wife and the egg verde. Both were good sized portions and tasty.  Would definitely come back again"}
{"text":"Food: wow this place is good! Have their corn beef skillet. The name sounded gross (got it on a recommendation), however when I got it I was pleasantly surprised. I also looked around at all the other plates and everything looked great and no one looked disappointed. On their drink menu they have fresh squeezed orange juice, that you can actually see them making. I would definitely recommend that.  Service: The service was friendly, fast, and delightful. My food did not take very long at all, I believe the wait was longer.  Location:  Butterfield has its own building in a small shopping plaza located in north Scottsdale. The location was clean and well kept. Although there is generally a wait (usually at least 20 minutes minimum)  it is very much worth it."}
{"text":"IMPORTANT POINTS:  1) They have two locations which are spacious, well-lit and family friendly.  2) The wait goes by quickly - especially since they allow you to check in with phone number for text updates on your table.   3) Quality food served by really kind servers who know how to keep their composure on busy mornings.  ------------  Looking for fine, fresh ingredients? Come to Butters! I recently visited my hometown to see my best friend and he showed me this incredible new brunch spot. Mind you, I AM OBSESSED WITH BREAKFAST. I typically stick to savory dishes but I stepped out of my box and asked for pancakes with my meal. NO REGRETS. I'm amazed by this restaurant. The hostesses were kind and quick to seat us. The server (long, beautiful black hair in box braids) was prompt and sweet. She made suggestions as to what her favorites were and recommended items on the menu that were popular. I stuck with all of her suggestions, of course! Food came out quickly and it was sooooo damn good. I will come back.   WILDBERRY BLISS PANCAKES - 5/5 MUST ORDER DUE TO THE MARSCAPONE ALONEEEEEE!  GARDEN SKILLET 5/5 - I had my eggs cooked over easy and I added bacon for an additional charge.   PECAN CAKES 4/5 - this was my friend's choice! I loved it but it wasn't my favorite.   CREATE YOUR OWN OMELETTE 4/5 - my friend added avocado, mushroom, sausage, and jack cheese. The egg is SOOOO fluffy. It was pretty damn delicious. Idk though, I might be weird but I may have found it a little too fluffy. It would've been better with sriracha but they don't offer that...  HASHBROWNS 5/5 - They updated their hashbrowns! Nice and flat and crispy. Love it!"}
{"text":"Gave themselves a tip on my card for the coffee I got while waiting in line.  I won't be back.  Oh, and the waitress was just plain rude. My entire party were shocked at how bitchy she was. There are too many great places for breakfast in Phoenix with good service to ever come back here."}
{"text":"Fantastic food!  Our server Regina was super!  She was friendly, attentive, and professional. The pancakes were light and the size of a frisbee.  The omlette's were the size of a loaf of bread.  The orange juice was so fresh it's momma didn't miss it yet.  Yeah, we kinda liked it here.  Will be back"}
{"text":"Visiting Scottsdale and Butters was recommended.  YUM!  Food is wonderful, service is fast.  The variety of pancakes.....WOW!  2nd visit just as good.  Don't miss out!"}
{"text":"Butters pancake restaurant on northsight has to be one of the most efficiently ran restaurants in all of Scottsdale and Phoenix! Great food, great restaurant, great service!!!"}
{"text":"Great For Breakfast..everything I have ordered,.. Throughly enjoyed ..Omelets, Popeye is delicious  Butter is my favorite, when I am in Scottsdale, AZ.  A True Foodie"}
{"text":"We were traveling in Arizona and I always use Yelp to find the best places to go to and Butters was one of those places. We went for breakfast/brunch on a Saturday and I had their wildberry bliss pancakes which were more than blissful. The wait time was a bit on the long side, but the food was worth it. It was also a bit crowded and the tables are very cramped, but since it was so hot nobody was using the patio, so that may have alleviated things. I'd love to go back and try some of their omelets and other savory menu items."}
{"text":"We went there twice for breakfast during Arizona Bike week. Each time we had great food and wonderful service. I don't think breakfast can get much better than this! Between the three of us over two days we tried a good variety of their menu selections. Everything was wonderful. You guys have it down!!"}
{"text":"I have been to Butters a couple of times since my previous review. I think it is important to mention that the lines here really are long on weekends and holidays. Expect to wait a while with a buzzer to notify you when a table is ready.  They move patrons through pretty rapidly and the service is very efficient. Despite the rush, our waitstaff has always been very attentive and never hurried us through our meal. The food on the other hand does seem to be a bit rushed sometimes, though I can't say I blame them given the demand and long lines of patrons. Although the food is good (despite the seemingly hurried preparation) it is not worth waiting 40+ minutes for it in my opinion.   The grits are standard fare, the pancakes are good but nowhere near the best I've had. The stuffed french toast tends to be on the soggy side. The smoothies are really quite good, especially the strawberry one. The omelettes are kind of hit or miss. Sometimes the ingredients are distributed poorly and you get a super cheesy area while the rest of the omelette is packed with onions or peppers. It may largely depend on who is in the kitchen that day or how rushed they are, but I like my omelettes to be packed with ingredients that are up in each other's business.   The Mexican Egg Burrito is pretty good and filling if you are hungry, but again nothing to write home about. I have tried it with both chorizo sausage and plain sausage and either way it seems to taste about the same. Maybe it's just me. If you like your fiod smothered in chile sauce then I highly recommend the Eggs Verde.  Some of Butters' best items are their fresh squeezed OJ, their fresh smoothies, and their delicious coffee. Their hashbrowns are pretty solid too, and if you want a good filling meal then the omelettes are not a bad way to go but make sure the cook really tosses the ingredients before wrapping everything up! I also highly recommend their benedicts as they are very tasty."}
{"text":"Been craving a great breakfast for awhile. This place delivered. Everything from the coffee to to the bacon was perfect. Great quality chow! Also- fresh squeezed oj! We will def be coming back."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre at best and the noise and loud music was deafening!"}
{"text":"If you want to talk during your breakfast don't bother coming here. It's extremely loud. The music is totally unnecessary. The food is good but we won't be coming back since you leave with a headache. People have to scream in order to be heard over the music. If your looking for a nice quiet breakfast go somewhere else. Also the prices are as high as the noise."}
{"text":"Great place, been to this location a couple of times now, each visit - great food, excellent, friendly service and enjoyable experience. Standouts - cinnamon roll pancakes rule, crave-worthy cheesy grits and really good coffee that never went half empty due to the great and really friendly servers. Funny how most breakfast places serve mediocre coffee - here they get it.   Try it, either here or their other location on McCormack ranch - it will become a go-to."}
{"text":"So I do not usually give 5 stars I have only been here once and I'm tempted but I'll go with four stars until I go back again. The eggs! How in the hell did they get the eggs that fluffy? I have never in my life had eggs that light and aerated. The bacon was good, thick crispy edges and chewy as well. I had a pecan waffle, light crispy a great waffle. The hashbrowns were full of texture, crispy edges, soft inside. An all around great meal. When I have out of town guests we are going here!"}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times now and would highly recommend it. The service is excellent. I always receive my food quick, and they come to take your order quickly and check on you multiple times during your visit. They also leave a pitcher of water on the table so during my visits I've never run out of beverage which is very important for me. The food is excellent. Everything I've tried so far is fantastic. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I was there for breakfast on Tuesday Oct 11th. I finished my breakfast and was reading the paper and drinking coffee when a woman walked in with a pretty big dog. The dog's tail came up on my table and spilled the coffee. If she would have come by 5 minutes earlier it's tail would have gone into my food. I said something to the woman but she did not hear me cause she was talking on her cell phone. I asked the waitress to send the manager over. A female comes over and said she the was the manager. I told her what happened and she really did not seem to care at all. The manager just said it was a service dog. Pretty much this dogs tail coming up on my table hitting me and spilling my coffee was ok. I think she should have gone to the ignorant woman and asked to see proof it was a service dog. She also should have told the woman to control her dog. The dogs tail should not be coming up on a customers table. The manager took no action. I felt I needed to let this woman know what happened. I went to the woman's table and told her your dogs tail came up on my table when you walked by. She says that must have scared the hell out of you and laughed. I told her the dog probably should not be in here. She then pulls the Service Dog card and states it is a service dog. This woman is a liar and just wanted her dog with her for breakfast. She did not even apologize for her dogs tail spilling my coffee. Her only disability is she is an ignorant woman.  I will not be going back."}
{"text":"I've been to too many breakfast places and they all seem to be decent but none really wow me.  I was starting to think maybe breakfast food is just breakfast food until I came here.  Every part of my entree tasted special and different than what I was used to.  The omelette was so extremely fluffy and thick that I wonder how much of it was just air.  I mean that in a good way because it tasted great and was filling.  The hash browns were thick with a crunchy top and soft bottom. They were more like scalloped potatoes.  The pancakes were a bit sweeter than normal but that was why it was good.  Definitely want to come back to try other things."}
{"text":"Wow. It was absolutely worth the 45 minute wait on a Sunday morning!  We had a party of six and they seated us just as quickly as the two tops.  Great prices and everything was made from scratch. I had the New Mexico Skillet and the best part was the homemade 'hashbrowns' - potato slices cooked until slightly crunchy OMD! (Oh my delicious!)  Others at our table had crepes, banana bread French toast, eggs Benedict and a tuna sandwich. Everyone was impressed with the quality and went home with full bellies.   Restaurant and bathrooms were clean. Service was efficient. They've got something good going here!"}
{"text":"Wow - I heard this place was good and it exceeded expectations!  I enjoyed a hot chocolate and the strawberry crepes today.  The crepes are served with fresh strawberries and a housemade strawberry glaze...yummy!  My fellow diners enjoyed the mexican burrito, the veggie omelette and the cinnamon bun pancakes - both looked amazing!  The restaurant is bright and clean and the staff is friendly.  Our server took a while to take our orders, but the food came out super quick once we ordered and we could tell everything was made to order fresh.  This place is definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"So frustrating and disappointing! We've cone here before and everything was awesome! Had a party of 6, but two groups of 5 got seated before us. Did not stay. Boo!"}
{"text":"I normally eat savory breakfasts but for some reason, I had to get pancakes this morning because of the name of this restaurant- Butters Pancakes. I mean, how can you say no to that?  From start to finish, you're served by kind hosts who check on your regularly and make sure you're doing okay.   Strawberry pancakes were spongey and perfect. I never get pancakes for breakfast but this restaurant made me regret all the times I didn't!  Coffee was on point; I should've asked what kind of coffee they were using!   And finally, the famous hashbrowns were good but not great. I liked how it wasn't salty and tasted fresh but it wasn't the best I had.   Next time I'm craving pancakes (now I know there'll be a next time), I'll make sure to stop by Butters in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"It's just super good food, no other way to describe it. The first time I went here was with a friend from Tucson, and he gets so stoked every time he comes up to Phoenix now because this is where he goes for breakfast, and I don't blame him. It's SOOOO good."}
{"text":"Sadly, we thought we got nickeled & dimed.  Upcharge of $1.99 for skim milk for coffee was disappointing.  We were given heavy whipping cream for coffee. Bizarre since half & half is what most people use. Eggs were runny & potatoes tasted like vegetable oil.  Saving grace... pancakes were good.  No extra napkins on the table.  When we requested them we didn't get them.  Staff seemed in a hurry to clear our table.  & the bill was given to us as soon as we started eating."}
{"text":"OMG....The Wildberry Bliss Pancakes are absolutely wonderful. The name of the pancakes did not lie! The pancakes are blissfully fluffy and buttery on the outside that just melts in your mouth with all that fruit goodness and mascarpone. These are the best dang pancakes I have ever had!!! If I ever come back to visit AZ I will be coming back here for brunch.  Also had the Irish Benny which was delicious as well! It's a eggs benedict (My favorite breakfast item) with corned beef hash. I have never had an eggs benny this way but it was super flavorful. The eggs were poached perfectly.   Must get the OJ! Freshly squeezed! Ohh so refreshing!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite breakfast spot. I love coming in with my hubby for a quick bite during the week. But during tourist season and the weekends this place is a mad house with an hour wait. I have to wait for the summer months when the snow birds go home to get in here the weekends.  They have opened another location near the airpark and maybe that will help.  I love the benedicts and the ever-so-delicious nutella and banana crepes. Their skillets are terrific and my hubs always has the same custom omelet.  Try the peppermint mocha, as well! Yummy."}
{"text":"This was pretty much the best breakfast I've ever had. Everything about my Belgian waffle and bacon was perfect. My date had a pancake combo with an omelette. Again, perfect. The omelette was like an egg calzone; I have no idea how they do it. We shared an OJ, which was the best tasting orange juice either one of us had ever tried.  Service was very adequate and the price was right.  My only bitches are the wait and the amount of crap on the small table. I can see why other reviewers complain about the servers and bussers pulling stuff off the table too quickly, as there are too many bottles of stuff (including a pitcher of water). I don't think they they can do much about the wait."}
{"text":"Excellent !   If you are looking for a classy, high end breakfast place this is it!! The best Breakfast around. Delicious....They serve lunch too!   All is Wonderful."}
{"text":"Amazing food and good service. Egg dishes - Really fluffy and soft."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick delicious breakfast! I wish the place had a private room because we meet here weekly for a working breakfast."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast!  Very economical!!  We arrived on Saturday at 11:15 and were seated at 12:00. The 45 minutes flew by and were well worth the wait. I had the California scrambler, and to my joy and surprise I had a choice of grits!!!  It is rare that restaurants offer grits. And these grits were the best I have ever had!!  Ever!! Creamy and a bit cheesy, excellent!!  My husband had the banana nut bread french toast-WOW!!  And our two 6 yr old twin girls devoured their pancakes and scrambled eggs. All in all, we will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is a huge improvement over Le Peep which previously occupied this space.  I eat here most weekends and have never had poor service and the food has always been consistently good.  This is a step up from the usual Good Egg, Chompies, any bagel joint type choices that you have in Scottsdale.  Lines start to form after 9am on weekends so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"Here we are back in Scottsdale a year later and the first place we go for breakfast is Butter's. It is absolutely as good as we remembered!!  We are in town for 9  days and plan to have breakfast here multiple times."}
{"text":"When I saw that Butters had opened, I instinctively pictured pancakes topped with lots of butter.   In actuality, Butters is a lot like Butterfield's (apparently owned by the same people), with a great selection of egg dishes and skillets.  However, the decor at Butters is sleek and modern, instead of the carpety, flowery, old people-y look of Butterfield's.  There's also a nice patio.  On the flip side, the staff wasn't quite as friendly.  They were competent, just not overly friendly.  Like Butterfield's, Butters is quite busy on weekends.  We waited about 30 minutes.  The Village Roastery in the same plaza is a great place to enjoy some coffee while waiting for a table at Butters."}
{"text":"All the normal breakfast staples served in a great atmosphere.  I was amazed at the speed at which our breakfast arrived.  I mean quick, like lightning fast.  I hope to return soon."}
{"text":"Family favorite of all the breakfast places we tried in Scottsdale. We have two gluten-free eaters, so the pancakes here were a welcome surprise, and even the non-gluten people agreed that they were the best we've tasted.  Service was good, coffee was good, prices are fair. If you seek a something for everyone place for breakfast, this is it."}
{"text":"The food is amazing here!! They have a ton of fun food options-- especially pancakes. I definitely want to go back and try them all!! My friends and I got skillets which were amazing and they come with so much!!!   However, I have four stars because I was disappointed with their customer service, or lack thereof. The hostess and waitress we had seemed very disinterested which, intentional or not, came off as rude.   When seating us, our hostess never looked at us, put the menus on the table (didn't pass them out or put them in front of us as most restaurants do), and just left?? Didn't say anything. Our waitress didn't say much either. She came to take our order (not having introduced herself or asked us how or morning was). While we were in the middle of our meal she gave us our check and told us no rush?? I definitely felt rushed after that! So we paid (mind you we still hadn't finished our meals) and we never saw her again. I had to go get my own to-go box.   The food was delicious and I'll definitely be back for those pancakes, but seriously I'm still disappointed with their customer service."}
{"text":"This was a great place for lunch after a visit to Butterfly Wonderland.  The Florentine Benedict delicious.  The cinnamon roll pancakes were also delicious.  The biscuits and gravy Benedict was our last favorite."}
{"text":"Consistently good. We have been coming to Butters at different locations for years. It's our weekly routine. They have really good coffee, which is important for hubby. I love their fresh OJ."}
{"text":"This is a perfect place for breakfast. Simple, appropriate decorations but truly outstanding service. I can order a warm and hearty breakfast here and be served as quickly as at McDonalds. The staff are very friendly and cater to your needs. Whether a big breakfast or small, Butters is just right. for me."}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast place ever! I highly recommend the banana cream pancakes. To. Die. For! Staff is awesome, coffee was great and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I finally made it to Butters for breakfast.  I am going to make this short and simple.  The food, service and everything was fantastic.  Do yourself a big favor and give them a try."}
{"text":"The pancakes are loaded with toppings and amazing!! We ordered the banana cream pancakes to share and they were perfect. We also ordered the Eggs Verde and the Mexican egg burrito. These two items were okay, nothing special but a good savory breakfast to have. Would probably come back just to try their other pancakes   The wait can be long but you can always grab some coffee from the restaurant and lounge around outside."}
{"text":"My whole family were so happy we chose this amazing place, the morning of my daughters H.S. Graduation. We wanted to make the whole day special, and eating here started the day off wonderfully. There was a little bit of a wait (15 min) but well worth it. The staff is very friendly and the food is phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Three words: cinnamon roll pancakes! Sooo good they're dangerous. There was a long wait, but it was well worth it. Reasonably priced, nice ambiance and a lot to do in the area while you wait. We will definitely be back soon! One of the best birthday meals I've had in years."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with banana bread French toast and a side of fluffy eggs. My first time visiting and the service was prompt. If I'm in the area, I'll definitely stop by."}
{"text":"Fastest breakfast in the West...or anyplace else, really.  Was seated in half the quoted wait time.  After perusing the extensive menu and settling on the green chile omelette, food arrived in about 5 minutes.  It was everything a good omelette should be, light and fluffy.  The green chile sauce was bright and decently spicy.  Interesting take on hash browns.  Rather than the typical grated potato, these were very thinly sliced.  With more surface area, the crispiness was enhanced.  Excellent, high-quality, inexpensive breakfast food.  Even the standard issue brewed coffee was really good!  There's nothing really to improve on here!  I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Get the protein cakes - fresh blueberries mixed in and on top, and a yummy crunch from GF oats. No syrup needed!  Deducted a star for the watery coffee. Otherwise it was great!"}
{"text":"Ok the basic pancake was good.   Would not say the best, but good.   Service was good, coffee was good.   But i ordered pecan pancakes.  I expected pecans to be in the batter, not chopped on top of the pancake.   I am glad i did not order the blueberry pancakes as the last one i had was in upstate new york.  the bottom of each pancake was all blueberries with blueberries cooked into the pancake.  At $8.75 i expected a bit larger then 4 6inch pancakes.   And finally.  How can you be upper end and not serve real maple syrup.  Ok charge me an extra buck, I am already up to $12 for a pancake breakfast and coffee.  Don't mind paying for it, but i do expect to leave thinking i can't wait to go back.    Easily the most overpriced pancake breakfast i have ever had.  I spoke with my wife who had managed kitchens and yes Pecans should go in the batter.   I was able to also see the menue after writing this .. The description was 'stuffed'  .. so what i got was not what i should have gotten.  I was served 4 buttermilk pancakes (same size as the one my son got as a substitute for toast).   His were chocolate chip and the pancakes were not stuffed.  He immediately rubbed it in and said .. Dad for 2 bucks more you could have gotten an Eggs skillit and 2 pancakes.  My guess is that they screwed up and the waitress grabbed buttermilk pancakes throwing the topping on them.   2nd screw up i assume was that i got pancakes that would have been provided as a sub for toast."}
{"text":"No other way to put it, delicious! I've been 3 times in the past few months. Everything is terrific"}
{"text":"Food was good-wait was too long for a restaurant with an entirely open patio. Not sure who's idea this was for an Scottsdale restaurant but we were told the patio was for waiting only. No staff to service patio- if you order to go you can go out there and eat.   It's Arizona- one of the things I look for in any restaurant is outside seating especially breakfast to eat in our beautiful morning weather."}
{"text":"When coming from California to visit our family in Phoenix we always make a visit here. It is always fresh and always delicious. And such nice staff."}
{"text":"Clean, fast, organized, smiles, conversation, attentive!  Great good!, Chili Verde is the real deal from a Mexican from Los Angles, Ca. Will be back, with the family, entire family."}
{"text":"Parking here is crazy on the weekends! But you can't keep me and family from eating here when we all have time to get together! I love the huevos rancheros with green and red sauce, and they have amazing fresh pressed orange juice. Usually there's a wait when we show up, but it goes by pretty fast, and if you're feeling so inclined there is a coffee shop next door to make the time go by faster. Oh, also, the mixed berry crepe is to die for (it's not too sweet and comes with fresh berries, not the sludge-sugar basted kind at Dennys!)"}
{"text":"The service is always great the food is always consistently good Best breakfast spot in scottsdale"}
{"text":"I love heather, she always remembers what i eat and gets me in and out quickly  The food and service at all three location are always great"}
{"text":"Great place and great food! Wife had the eggs Benedict and I had the western omelette with a cinnamon swirl pancakes! Also the freshly squeezed orange juice is a must! Would definitely go back again! So many options!"}
{"text":"My second time in Scottsdale and this place not only has excellent food, but service was exceptional. The staff was quick, attentive and polite. I will definitely be revisiting anytime I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time on a weekend away in Scottsdale. We stopped in on a Friday morning around 9:00am and were seated immediately. Our waitress was polite and quickly took our orders and got our food out to us. They have a wonderful variety of breakfast foods at fantastic prices. My husband and I liked it so much Friday that we decided to go back Saturday morning around 10:30am. Obviously the second time it was crowded but we only had to wait 20 minutes and they text us that our table was ready. Will definitely be back the next time we're in the area!"}
{"text":"That's one helluva pancake! Dang delicious, melt in your mouth butter! Yummmm not to mention the fresh squeezed orange juice is so amazing!   Great service, but expect a wait for a table any day of the week!"}
{"text":"I had time to kill before going to the airport so I decided to have breakfast. Since I was staying in Scottsdale I decided to check out this place. It had very good reviews and I'm a sucker for pancakes. The menu is extensive, but I decided to get an omelette because you get pancakes or toast with the omelette.  The omelette was large, light and fluffy as well as the protein power pancakes I had. They give you plenty of food because the omelette also comes with a choice of hash browns or grits. The fresh squeezed orange juice was delicious and I had to refrain from ordering more. I left stuffed and it should satisfy my hunger on the long flight home.  For those who love breakfast, this is highly recommended,"}
{"text":"We came here on Monday morning after a search for brunch place in the neighborhood.  This place was close by and had good reviews,  so we decided to give it a try.  Our server Sydney provided fast and friendly service. The restaurant was quite busy but our server provided timely service and checked up on us regularly. Vanilla Latte was delicious. we ordered gravy Benedict and wild berry cakes and both were beautifully plated in generous portion and were very tasty.  Great way to start a week.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Behold, the power of turning tables! Butters won't win you over with their A-quality fare -- though it is competent and reasonably turned out -- but holy cats is their service zippy. Considerable lines on weekdays during spring training go through with clockwork efficiency. Speedy and attentive service with a smile -- the thing that really impressed me most about this place. As others have mentioned, I can only imagine what the waits must be like on the weekend, and frankly don't intend to find out."}
{"text":"A good breakfast place.  Nice variety on the menu, decent food, and very busy.  Based on many of the other glowing reviews, I was expecting a lot more from Butters.  I had the Santa Fe Scrambler with a side of pancakes.  Eggs were pretty spicy in a good way.  Hash browns were a bit heavy on the oil for my tastes, though.  Pancakes were decent.  We also tried the wheat pancakes, which were okay.  I was surprised they serve pancake syrup, rather than pure maple.  Fast, efficient service."}
{"text":"The wait was about 40 minutes and worth every minute.  From the coffee (local roast) to the home cut hash browns, butter milk pancakes, skillets, and omelets (chorizo sausage) were all excellent.  The price point was excellent with substantial portions.  Service was great, atmosphere casual, clean and managed well."}
{"text":"I have celiac and the food did not make me sick, so four that they get four stars. I had to skillet, because it was the only option for dairy free and gluten-free. It tasted delicious though, so it was OK that that was my only choice. Because I have so many restrictions, my food usually does not come out right the first time. But at butters they did it right the first time."}
{"text":"Lordy!! A friend brought us here for a late breakfast. We stayed for two hours! We ate our way through the entire time. Crepes, pancakes, the best ever. Their chicken sausage was delicious!! The most amazing dish was,the grits. Creamy awesomeness that we ordered again!"}
{"text":"I was so glad that my cousin and his girlfriend introduced me to Butters!! I had the Florentine Benny and a pancake. Despite the large portion, I finished it all with ease because the food was so good! In fact, I even had some of my cousin's girlfriend's Country Benny, and it was very rich and tasty! We went on a Saturday and the wait was quite long since they were super busy."}
{"text":"This place is in front of my gym. Went on my co-workers suggestion. I'm glad I did. My breakfast skillet (New Mexico) was excellent. Our service was great, food was so yummy. Next time I'm bringing my family for brunch."}
{"text":"Nice breakfast place in plaza setting. Dina my waitress was very good greeted with a smile and checked to make sure all was good.  Had the eggs bacon side of grits and strawberry pancakes.  All was made well grits were very creamy and well everyone has there own way of how grits should be prepared...me I liked them that way and they had good flavor.  And as others say you can't beat fresh squeezed OJ ... unless you don't like OJ but that's just  unamerican lol .."}
{"text":"Butters Pancakes and Cafe is tops on the list for breakfast, freshly squeezed OJ and the quality of food is off the chain. Be sure to bring some patience in getting seated as the wait can be 45mjn to hr depending on time of day. I had the banana cream pancakes and this is the first time I ever ate pancakes without syrup. As for the establishment, solid very clean and the the wait staff and hostess are friendly."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town and the wife can't resist a place with tons of pancakes and French toast options. My wife had the banana cream pancakes and they were out of this world. The sauce was not heavy but full of flavor with no syrup needed. I had the Mexicana that was light and fluffy with cheese grits and pancakes. The cheese grits had good flavor and the omelet was packed with goodness. Our waitress couldn't have been any better and the food was quickly served. Great place with a big Menu!! Would come back in a heartbeat!!"}
{"text":"My family took me here for brunch since I came to visit from California and it was great! I was warned the food portions were big so I decided to get something simpler and ordered eggs, bacon, pancakes, and hush Browns. It was still a lot of food but it was amazing. The pancakes were fluffy and tasty that I didn't need syrup. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"6 HUGE STARS!  This lovely breakfeastery doesn't disappoint! I had the best eggs Benedict, Irish style with the most outrageously delicious corned beef hash.   And followed that with the berry mascarpone pancakes that were decadent ,  flavorful and absolutely perfect.  The waitress was as sweet as the pancakes and the service was superb !"}
{"text":"Butters was REALLY great. I'll have to try a few more dishes before giving it 5 stars, but the prices were incredibly reasonable for Scottsdale, the service was prompt, and I agonized for a while over what to eat because everything looked so appealing.  The restaurant has an updated diner feel, and I wish they had one closer to us in central Phoenix, because the prices at OverEasy and Taylor Cafe are prohibitive. Seriously, if this place was located closer, we'd be there every weekend.  I was really satisfied with my skillet. I wouldn't say it was amazing or anything, but breakfast food is tough to innovate, and I'm fine with it that way.  Also, it's kind of fun thinking about the South Park character, like when he became a pimp that one time."}
{"text":"Finally made it to Butters this AM - wish I had made it out sooner - THE FOOD WAS GREAT!  I had the Eggs Benedict Florentine w/ Breakfast Sausage and Cheese Grits. I don't normally order Eggs Benedict when I'm eating out because most places just don't seem to get it right - not the case here and they actually offer a variety of options in how you can have it.   I brought a friend / colleague for an early AM session - they open at 630 (that's a plus) - we both ate comfortably for $20 plus tip.   Service was good - the staff was kind - portions generous, combined with the overall experience was what will be keeping me coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness. Stop reading and just go already! This place is incredible. There has been no other pancake so scrumptious or an experience so great. Friendly staff, great prices, fantastic food. Expect a line, it's well worth the wait. I wish I had this where I am from."}
{"text":"Walked right in on a Sunday morning with no wait.  Coffee was high octane; fresh and strong.  Made the big mistake of ordering Swedish pancakes. Thin cakes whose edges were fried to a crisp yet the middle was a bite of warm uncooked batter. To her credit, our server cheerfully took them back to show the cooks how not to do it.    Unfortunately, the substitute item I ordered took so long to make it to me that I ended up canceling it. Apparently the same kitchen that served me raw batter got overwhelmed and couldn't which out an order of standard pancakes - their signature item.   This fledging location is trying, but needs time to get its act together to compete with other outstanding breakfast options in the area. One day I'll give it another shot, but that day will only come when I'm confident that I won't be a guinea pig."}
{"text":"We were in area and got to this place. The wait was long for Saturday morning. We were glad we did wait. Fantastic food. We had the egg verde and strawberry cheesecake French toast. It was delicious. Good service. They refreshed the coffee frequently."}
{"text":"We LOVE this place. They have great servce!!! We always get seated quickly and we love having the pitcher of water on the table. Makes it easier to fill when needed and not have to wait for a waiter.   The food is amazing. You can eat here whether you are a health freak or a down right dirty eater. Either way, your meal comes with plenty of food. California Scrambler is amazing as is the Fresh Strawberry French Toast. They also serve freshly squeeze orange juice. Real orange juice!!! Prehaps a bit expensive for the orange juice but it is worth it if you like orange juice.  Definitely worth the drive."}
{"text":"Visited two times while in Phoenix.  Absolutely fabulous food. I had the salmon egg scramble and berry pancakes. So delicious. Make sure to try cheese grits and fresh squeezed orange juice."}
{"text":"I have eaten at their other locations so knew what to expect......consistently great food.  The wait can be long but worthwhile."}
{"text":"Quick and efficient service regardless of how busy it is. Don't let the wait time veer you away. The hype for this place is well deserved! Delicious food, attentive staff, very accommodating."}
{"text":"Busy little breakfast place. Everyone I went with had savory breakfasts and they were very good. The sweet stuff looked good too. The coffee wasn't great, but they have a full specialty coffee menu as well. The service was lacking, but the food made up for it and I'd go back!"}
{"text":"Need a whole hearted breakfast, then this is your place. Had to wait for about fifteen minutes but the plaza is really nice so it's a nice walk.  Started the morning with a good ole fashion coffee. Feeling adventurous I had the New Mexico skillet. The potatoes harsh had chorizo and tomatoes. It was topped with the fluffiest eggs I have ever had and avocado. This dish was light but hearty at the same time.  The whole hog skillet had bacon, sausage and had in the harsh and topped with their fluffy eggs.  This dish was surprisingly not salty considering it had bacon, sausage and ham in it. This was a great dish.   The blue berry pancakes were dessert for breakfast.  Each cake was filled with a lot of blueberries and between each was a whipped mascarpone cream.  Heavenly!  Staff was very attentive!"}
{"text":"Best pancakes ever!!!!    Most of the breakfast entrees come with pancakes.    Upgrade your pancake to one of their speciality cakes and you will not be sorry.    Banana Cream pancake is the best cake we have ever had.    Oreo cake is a little over the top with cream and chocolate.    You will not be disappointed in this breakfast place.   Sat on the patio under the blue sky with the heaters on and it was awesome."}
{"text":"We loved just about everything about our visit. The service was super friendly and very accommodating. I had the eggs Benedict, my husband had scrambled eggs and bacon, and out toddler had silver dollar pancakes.   My Benedict was great, the hollandaise was top notch and my egg was poached perfectly. Our hash browns were great and the bacon was thick, well cooked, and delicious. The side of fruit was fresh, delicious, and irresistible to my son. He also gobbled up almost all of his pancakes and he's usually very picky.   The place is pretty small and packed in, so that can present a challenge, but we went late Tuesday morning so we had basically no wait.   If we are in the neighborhood on a weekday, we'd totally go again. A busy weekend will probably bring a long wait, but the food will be worth it!"}
{"text":"Terrible service, below average food and a hostess that was completely unpleasant. Way too many breakfast places for this type of food and service. Don't order the Vermont syrup...total rip off.  Bottom line, not worth the wait or hassle."}
{"text":"Butters is BY FAR my favorite place in the Valley to get breakfast. The staff is always friendly, and the food is amazing.   Every time I go I order the Denver omelette made with egg whites and feta cheese. It is so light and fluffy, and always comes out served hot. The I order it served with has browns and either toast/pancakes. The pancakes and syrup here are definitely a must-try! Much better than IHOP or Wildflower. I always make it a priority to order their orange juice as well, as it comes fresh-squeezed from the oranges that they keep stocked in the front of the restaurant.   Just as a heads up, if you plan on going on the weekends, make sure you go with enough time to spare because the place is ALWAYS PACKED! Not a huge problem though if you come with good company and good conversation."}
{"text":"The yelp photos look better than the dishes come out in real life... but make no mistake the food is good! The pancakes were delicious and I don't even eat pancakes. I think my favorite ones were the wild berry and the banana cream.   The corned beef hash was good but not great... the salmon cream cheese omelette had way too much cream cheese.. I think that dish or the fruit cup were my least favorite things.   Btw it's only 1 dollar to make your side of pancakes into the flavored pancakes so you should definitely take advantage of that.   Also, wow, the wait staff here... super attractive. Seriously. I'm coming back."}
{"text":"We decided to try something new for breakfast today and it was great! We went on a Saturday at about 11 am and had to wait about 20 minutes because the restaurant was so busy. When we got seated everything was very efficient. We got coffee and drinks quickly and a pitcher of ice water was on the table when we sat down.  My wife and I ordered a scrambler and a sweet crepe and split them both. There was tons of food! We will be skipping lunch because we are so full. The food came out hot and extra quick (about 5 minutes). There was no slowdown of service because they were busy.  Great place and we will definitely be going again."}
{"text":"The wait is worth it. Had a very enjoyable breakfast outside...very attentive service. Good coffee! Lots of menu options to choose from, something for everybody."}
{"text":"Amazingly average food with a Snobbsdale price tag. Traffic and parking are difficult as well, especially combined with overly aggressive Snobbsdale PD and the quite numerous traffic cameras at lights, on poles, and in mobile units. Short of having to be a lemming and follow trendy masses, there is really no reason to go out of your way to eat here. Once was enough for me."}
{"text":"Ridiculously good. I was very hungry but it just may be the best pancake I've ever eaten. I had the Mexicana Omelette and it was HUGE. My daughter's French toast was fluffy and delicious. The price was unexpectedly reasonable for how delightful the food was. All I can critique is although the service was good, very fast and accurate, it was not very friendly. No smile from the girl at the front that checked us in and seated us to our server."}
{"text":"Really good food, excellent service.  If there is one thing I would change, it would be the noise level.  Truly jarring.  A little effort to dull the roar would make a big difference."}
{"text":"I really liked the pancakes here. Lived up to the reviews, when I'm in the area I'll visit again."}
{"text":"Delicious...Service was great, food came out in a timely manner. Nice breakfast on the patio. Had the classic skillet and the corn beef hash skillet. Both were very good. Needed to go  boxes...see you next week."}
{"text":"Despite the 45 minute wait, the food was awesome, and they bring food very quickly after ordering. They have a very full menu, so there's bound to be something for everyone!   The crepes were very light and fluffy, and the banana creme sauce was delightful. The omelettes are hearty and cooked to perfection! Overall, very yummy!"}
{"text":"Really fast and friendly service - with delicious food to boot! I had the country benny, and it lasted about five minutes before it was gone. Great coffee too. No wonder this place is always busy! Thanks for the awesome brunch Butters!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple times and I am never disappointed! The server was so nice and the food is AMAZING, probably the best pancakes I have ever had in my life! P.S. I got the cinnamon pancakes, they practically melt in your mouth!"}
{"text":"We loved Butters!  On vacation for 12 days, and three of those mornings we dined here.  Skillet meals, Benedicts, Pancakes -- even the accompanying fruit bowl or hashbrowns -- all delicious!  If we ever return to Scottsdale, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had breakfast here yesterday, while visiting Scottsdale from NM. It was very good! I had the classic waffles with fresh strawberries and my husband had the whole hog skillet with buttermilk pancakes. Their orange and grapefruit juice is fresh hand squeezed and delicious! The waffles were perfect, the eggs on my husband's skillet were perfectly cooked and their breakfast meats were good. The only reason we did not give them five stars, is personally we want buttermilk pancakes to taste like buttermilk, and they didn't. That being said, the pancakes were very nice and fluffy. Would definitely recommend and we will be eating here again."}
{"text":"I have never not been greeted with a smile until today. I work in the restaurant industry and know what should be expected of the waitstaff.  I have no idea what my servers name was, but she never checked on us and seemed as though my friend and I were a chore to her. I observed her being the same way towards other tables as well.  Horrible for a first time experience. Extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"Have had morning business meetings here. Great food and good environment. Can get a little loud when it is packed, but that just means it is a great place. Love the oatmeal and the french toast. Yum!"}
{"text":"This is my all time favorite breakfast joint on the planet. Food is just outstanding and the fresh sqeezed oj is amazing recommend the New Mexico skillet. It's amazing same goes for the farmers skillet.  Fish and chips take the cake to I recommend this place to everyone fun friendly and amazing food"}
{"text":"This is our weekly weekend breakfast spot. It is as good as everyone says it is. If you go at peak brunch time, plan accordingly. There will be a wait. Probably at least 30 minutes. Here is how we do it: Put your name on the list. Ask for the patio if it's open.  Go next door to Village Coffee. Get something to sip on and chill out while you wait.   I'm not usually a breakfast person, but this is good. Likely one of the best I've had. The OJ is fresh squeezed. The staff is helpful and attentive, but not overly so. When it's nice out, the patio is great (that's why we live here, right?). I go with the World's Pickiest Eater (gotta love her) and she over-complicates her order with special instructions every time. They always get it right. The small wins add up for me."}
{"text":"I can't think of a reason to take any stars off of this place. It's a great breakfast! The service kept our drinks filled at the height of a Saturday morning breakfast, AND our delicious breakfast choices came out surprisingly fast! I had a scramble/skillet and my date had a little of everything. It was all yummy. There's a patio as well when it's not too hot out for ya - always a nice feature in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Arizona! Please skip trendy Original Pancake House (it's really not that good). It is also definitely better than Butterfields (sister restaurant). I ordered the fruit pancakes with marscapone both times I've been. I also tried everyone else's dishes, all of which were great!"}
{"text":"Really great fluffy veggie omelets. We had it with the creamiest grits and buttermilk pancakes. The Carmel lattes were very good as well. Busy but not crowded at 7 am on a Friday. Excellent service made it a 5 Star experience."}
{"text":"This is a good breakfast restaurant. I'm a fan of their very large menu. Everything is just standard, except that they serve cheese grits (I'm a big fan). I do enjoy the updated decor. The previous establishment was decorated with country farm wallpaper and roosters. The service was good. Nothing to complain about... just not that extraordinary in my book."}
{"text":"Ok to start, I waited 35 minutes, that's ok because I wanted to try this spot. I received a text letting me know my table was ready and then I was not seated because I was missing one person in our party?!? So I sat for three instead , but I almost walked out because I was first hungry and irritated at the dumbest rule ! A table of four had to say now only 3 to be seated?? Come on your food better be that good. (To be continued) 10:25am    Ok guys- now Cook was our waitress and was strictly Business which is ok. No extra effort here, my coffee was never refilled she walked right around my table refilling!   The food is what will get my review to 3 stars instead of 4-5. If the staff was friendlier I could have done just that. But as busy as this place is it will catch up to them. To bad it's a Beauty of a place with sour fruit.  I hate leaving reviews like this but I'm a honest person"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to come here the Sunday after thanksgiving. The wait was less than 5 minutes. The waitress was so sweet and kind. Super efficient. My wife had the eggs Benedict and brioche  pancakrs. I had bacon sausage. Biscuits and gravy and a side of the protein power pancakes. Everything was amazing! This place knows how to do breakfast right. All the small things are done well,  like softened butter,  water craffs on the table. Your coffee never runs dry. Everything is done so well. We loved Everything!"}
{"text":"We found this little gem while we were in Scottsdale for Spring Training. Looked up good breakfast places and it came highly recommended. We gave it a shot and they did not disappoint. They wait staff was fantastic. Multiple people coming by with coffee and always checking on you. Then our food came. And we were blown away. The food is so good that we ate here 2x! Both times it was fantastic. We can't wait to come back to Arizona so we can have breakfast here again!!"}
{"text":"Good food, good service. Small dining room with lots of table crammed in. You WILL get to know your table neighbor. Wait is SUPER long though."}
{"text":"I discovered their Mexicana omelette on this past trip. This was ordered with egg whites, a side of fruit and their famous 6 pound biscuit. OK, it's not 6 pounds but you feel like you gained this after eating the decadent biscuit.   The Mexican Omelette has chorizo sausage, avocado, onion & your choice of cheese. My choice was a spicy jack cheese. The entire dish is smothered in a YUMMY mexico green chile sauce. This is really outstanding.   Fresh OJ, Good coffee and the above dish couple with great service. You'd think this place would be packed? The bad news is, it is packed!!! Get here early and you'll get a good booth spot."}
{"text":"We ate here on our way to The Open on the 4th and the food was delicious!!  We sat outside where the weather was gorgeous.  The pancakes are to die for-so soft and delicious!  Their coffee was also great, but getting cream or other things was a bit difficult at times.  The waitress kept just walking by... All in all, I would eat here again. Just hope the service is a bit better best time.  So I only gave 4 stars."}
{"text":"Won't be going back.  We came in as a party of 5 and they tried to seat us at a 4 top with one of us sitting on the corner of the table?  We were finally seated at an appropriate table. The service was lousy but the food was good....just waiting 35 minutes was too long.  There is no senior menu but the manager said my 80 year old mom couldn't order from the kids menu either (most places allow this).  Then we ordered some food with no oil and there was a pool of oil left on the plate.  We talked to the manager with no results.  Not going back."}
{"text":"Had heard a lot about Butters (mostly in reference to the other location) but had not been there before until yesterday, when I came here for breakfast. Got here right after opening time, so no waiting. Quick, friendly service. Delicious veggie omelet (how do they get it so fluffy?) different style hash browns that I liked a lot, and FABULOUS pancakes. Lots of food. A shade pricey for breakfast, but I don't go out often these days, so OK then! Didn't have time to really linger over it as I would have preferred, but got my coffee refill in a to go cup and was set for my day. Will be back."}
{"text":"Phoenix has a lot of great places to get something to eat. As far as breakfast is concerned, this place takes the (pan)cake. Delicious food at a reasonable enough price. If you're in the area, or even just the valley, you need to come here to get some breakfast."}
{"text":"Place is AMAZING!  Food is great, service is great, and atmosphere is delightful.  Everything is fresh and their restaurant branded syrup is so good!"}
{"text":"Basic midwestern breakfast joint. Owned and operated by the same people that run Butterfields here in the Phoenix area and in Chicago burbs. Always clean with delish food and pleasant waitstaff. My only ding is that the acoustics in this place are horrible. Any background music and/or the amount of people in the place can make the atmosphere painfully noisy. When I go there, I try to go early on the weekends or late in the morning on the weekdays to avoid the crowds."}
{"text":"I can never get enough of this place. Amazing food! Freshly squeezed orange juice! Good service, even for being how busy it is. Expect a little wait Saturday or Sunday morning."}
{"text":"Man, I read about this place on Yelp before we left Dallas. We flew in and went directly here from the airport. It was 8:30 local time and 10:30 our time so we were hungry after our flight.  We got there and there was a wait of about 15 minutes. No big deal. The OJ was perfect once we got a table. My wife got the Banana & Cream with Pecan Crumbles and Carmel Pancakes. I got the Mexicano Omelet. Both were off the chain good!!! The eggs were fluffy and tasty with a wonder of flavors inside. And my wife loved the pancakes so much that we are on our was back there now."}
{"text":"Just go here. Try to avoid the super busy obvious hours, unless you have time, a Saturday or Sunday wait of 30 minutes is nothing here. Know why? The food is great. It's not trendy, it's not a hipster joint, no fancy bloody's, just breakfast. If you don't like it here, something is horribly wrong with you. I am not a sweet breakfast kind of person, so I love all the savory stuff, my husband loves the sweets, pancakes, waffles, french toast! Everything is amazing. I wish I could go more often! But my new employment doesn't let me, I will have to make special time because there is an omelette calling my name right now..."}
{"text":"Food is average. Atmosphere is average. Service is good. They are consistent. Consistently average."}
{"text":"Too many tables...you sitting on top of each other.  $3.00 regular coffee?  Ridiculous!  No Senior discounts.  Expensive Breakfast menu."}
{"text":"So this has always been my favorite breakfast place to go.  They are truly an upscale style of a breakfast diner.  they move quickly and produce amazing food.  The manager, I refer to him as Mugsy, remembers you and is a hoot."}
{"text":"Great breakfast the other day, no wait which is always a surprise there. Omelettes are so fluffy and big. Hash browns tasted a little greezy so I didn't eat them, which saved me the unwanted calories. Food also pretty quick. I'd defiantly come back on a weekday to avoid the lines."}
{"text":"Butters. That says it all. I went one time with my girlfriend and instantly become a loyal regular customer. Excellent food selection and presentations. Can't get enough of the banana pancakes! Also the manager is fantastic. Greets and jokes with me every time I come in and even offered to buy me breakfast after my card wasn't almost working. Now that's customer service. I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go for a few years and I finally did, when I met somebody for a job interview last week I thought the food was going to be like all the other breakfast restaurants, which are okay but butters exceeded my expectations even the oatmeal, which I had...was fantastic!  Served fresh berries!! The omelette looked amazing! I'm definitely having an omelette next time."}
{"text":"I had the Eggs Benedict and with the hash browns and a side of sausages. The Eggs Benedict was tasty but the hash browns more resembled au gratin potatoes then hash browns. I thought the potatoes were unappetizing. The sausages were good and reminded me of some other wild (must be a local to figure this one out) breakfast place in the area that served the same product. The cost of my meal was in the $14 range since I ordered the side. The cost of the meal didn't even include a drink as I had water. So I thought the price of the meal was a lofty and not worth a return visit. I had decent service."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast spot! Love the area! They have super fast service and great food- it's always packed on the weekends but it never takes long to get seated. We enjoy the outdoor scenery and fountains while we wait- it's always fun to people watch too. As for food- the pancakes are obviously great and I love the waffles with strawberries and cream or even just a simple order of bacon eggs and pancakes- you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Breakfast is always yummy and perfect. I have never had a bad experience. Staff is attentive and amazing."}
{"text":"I think you are either a Butters fan or a Butterfield's fan, you can't be both (even though they are owned by the same brothers, weird, right? I know, but it's true and going to either one benefits the same owners anyway so who cares). And I my friends, well I am a Butters fan which says a lot because I am not a breakfast person, but if Butters is in the equation - I am so there.  Why do I love Butters so much? Well, it's their pancakes, specifically their Protein Power Cakes, well, more specifically it's their Egg-ceptional two egg breakfast with bacon, hash browns,  AND pancakes for $8.50. BUT you can upgrade to any one of their specialty pancakes for $1 more - done and done.  I get this exact meal every time I go there, I can't help and its sssooo much food. The portions here are very generous that you won't be hungry again until diner. Butters also offers fresh squeeze OJ, fountain soft drinks, tea, drip coffee and several espresso drinks.   On the weekends you can expect a 30-60 minute wait for breakfast it's that popular. Luckily, you can order drinks right next to the hostess stand so that you the coffee you need to help stay awake while you wait. Even with the chaos of maximum occupancy at all times during the weekend, the staff is always on their A game. My husband and I have never had bad service - ever; and all staff from the hostesses, coffee attendant, waiters, and bussers are always friendly and smiling (usually). When the weather is cooler, it's nice to sit outside on their patio, it's a pretty complex and there is a water fountain nearby."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place period. Very fresh ingredients and very tasty food. My favorite is the biltmore sandwich. The staff is super friendly too."}
{"text":"There is a good reason why there is usually a wait... The food is outstanding! This is a \"must try!\""}
{"text":"This is our go to spot for breakfast on the weekends!   We always have friendly servers. The food is delicious every time we go.  Typically I'll get the corned beef hash skillet, and my wife gets the chocolate chip pancakes. We then do what any sane people with multiple delicious food options on the table would do...split it!  ha ha.  The only down side is this place is so popular there's always a wait to get it, but it's well worth it.  We've been to many breakfast places in the greater Phoenix area, and this is hands down my favorite!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast spot in Scottsdale! You can't go wrong with anything you choose! But the best plates is the French toast and breakfast burrito. Always order a cup of coffee and the servers are on it about refills! The atmosphere is great and the workers couldn't be any nicer! The prices are excellent for the quality of food! When we feel lazy and just want to order to pick up, it's done in 15 min tops and tastes just as great at home in my pj's!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast place! The food here is delicious everything I've ordered from here is good. Waiters here are very nice and make sure your taken care of."}
{"text":"Butters is my absolute favorite place for brunch in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area. I love that the service is always prompt and the food comes out quick and fresh! My \"go to\" is the banana nut French toast, which is to die for. Anytime my husband suggests weekend brunch, my first choice is Butters... both Scottsdale locations are awesome."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here on a Saturday morning in July.  I ordered the Spanish Scramble.  It was good.  I don't have much to say.  It's close to home but it's just okay.  Still looking for my go-to breakfast joint."}
{"text":"This place ALWAYS delivers fresh tasting, yummy breakfasts with fresh juices, coffee, lemon ice-water AND with a smile!  It's as good as it gets in my humble opinion!"}
{"text":"Chris and his delightful staff excel at customer service and hospitality.  It's always a pleasure to come here to have a late breakfast (even at 2 p.m.!) and see a happy staff--or any time for that matter! This place is spotless, delicious, friendly and reasonably priced.  You can't go wrong, except for the long wait sometimes."}
{"text":"Great food, great staff and hot coffee....no better way to wake up. Unfortunately the snowbirds know it also!"}
{"text":"The 30 minute wait was totally worth it , I loved their French toast and pancakes. I can't say it's the best French toast ever ( that would be at Linger in Denver ) it's up there with the better ones I've had in the valley.   The wait aside everything else was prompt and the staff was very courteous. The veggie omelette was quiet honestly ginormous !  I did not get to try the coffee since I went next door for it while I waited on them , I had the OJ which was very nice.  Overall a good experience :)"}
{"text":"They have the best French toast and orange juice! The servings are huge and are more than enough. Such a cute place and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"When the server arrived with my breakfast, I was like that German guy staring at the Ark of the Covenant in Indiana Jones - I wanted to look away but couldn't - it was just that beautiful.  It was like Martha (fucking) Stewart stood at the doorway between the seating area and kitchen personally inspecting each plate for even the smallest of details, making sure each plate was perfect.  Omelets are huge, fluffy and bright yellow with no brown. Hash browns are large slices, like potato chips; just as thin and golden brown. Grits are as white and beautiful as Anderson Cooper's butt cheeks in the winter. (conjecture) And the pancakes. Ah, the pancakes.  Dusted with powdered sugar in a way that only my mother could make.  The real triumph in all of this are the grits.  I'm thinking the calorie count has to be equal to the square root of infinity but who cares, god bless america, the chef, Martha (fucking) Stewart, my waitress and anyone else who had a hand in these natural wonders.  I see myself ordering buckets of grits for takeout, going home and eating them until I shoot grit shrapnel out of my ass like an exploding space nebula. I'd aim at the neighbors dog - Casper. I hate that little fucker."}
{"text":"OMG.  The California Scramble was so good and I added strawberry pancakes.  So NOT IHop. The banana nut bread French toast was too sweet for me but Dani loved it"}
{"text":"Excellent pancake options. Outdoor seating has a nice atmosphere indoor very nice as well. Good coffee, great service and food. Busy, be ready for a wait but I would rather have that to get to great food and service."}
{"text":"Short story: the food is great, the service sucks. SUCKS. I'd love to give Butters a perfect review, but...no.  The food was delicious and you certainly get a LOT of it. I had the Popeye scrambler and added avocado with pancakes and cheesy grits. The scrambler was packed with the toppings, the pancakes were perfect, and the cheesy grits were like yummy mac 'n cheese with a creamy consistency.   The check was dropped off with the standard \"no worries, I'll take this when you're ready\" about 2 minutes after the food came. That should've been our first warning sign that they wanted our table for a big party that was waiting. Our waitress, Becca, never came back after that. We had to ask for refills of the coffee and then listen to her complain about how long we were taking about 6 feet from our table. Possibly in an effort to help move us along, the bussers began removing things from our table one by one the second there was one empty plate...water caraf, water glasses that we were still drinking from, syrup bottle, etc. After feeling really uncomfortable about sitting at our table, we got up to leave. As we did, Becca was coming out of the kitchen with another table's order. She turned back to the kitchen staff and said, \"Oh NOW they get up!\" I looked her in the eye and told her that was really rude. She looked away. My father-in-law spoke to the manager about it and was told they had 150 people waiting for tables, as if that were a good excuse for being openly rude to customers.  While good food is definitely what you go to a restaurant for, good service will make or break the experience. Considering this was breakfast, it was a total downer to start my day. Unfortunately, I won't be back any time soon."}
{"text":"Our favorite place thus far. Potatoes are always crispy and wonderful! Crepes are fabulous. Just everything is really really good. We take all our guests here. Caution, there is usually a long wait, so go early or just plan ahead. They keep the server sections is ship-shape, which is why there's a longer wait on the front side, but once seated everything is smooth and delightful. Coffee is great also:)"}
{"text":"My new favorite breakfast spot!  Awesome food, super friendly waitstaff!! Hostesses not so friendly...at all. But easy to overlook once you're at your table and greeted by the wait staff, great coffee, even greater fresh squeezed grapefruit juice and delicious food! I'd give them 5 stars if the host staff was friendly and smiled! That would make it perfect!"}
{"text":"Butters was absolutely packed when we got there this morning and had to wait an hour before we were seated. Given the great reviews, we decided it was worth it- totally not worth it. I ordered the New Mexico skillet and my boyfriend the California scramble with pancakes. I can't speak for the scramble but the skillet was unappetizing. I ordered the eggs to be over medium, got over easy; chorizo was soooooooo salty and had a very strange aftertaste, making it pretty much inedible; potatoes drenched in oil/grease. I was so excited for the pancakes but even those were lackluster. It was light and fluffy but it just sort of crumbled in my mouth. There were two things I did love: First is the freshly squeezed OJ. Yum. Second is the service. My waitress (shucks that I can't remember her name) was great- very sweet, attentive, and pleasant."}
{"text":"They serve the tastiest and fluffiest pancakes I've ever had in my life. This will be our go to breakfast spot whenever we visit Scottsdale."}
{"text":"No complaints here.  They have all the bases covered for a good breakfast joint: food, service, menu variety, seating.  Also, they have a lunch menu available (though it is primarily a breakfast spot). Since this seems to be the only solid breakfast restaurant in the immediate area, it gets real busy on weekends."}
{"text":"As good as it gets describes our breakfast experience at Butters this morning.  We arrived just as they opened, so there was not much activity.  The grapefruit juice was fresh squeezed Ruby Red Grapefruit - not too bitter: just the right amount of sweetness.  My wife had the classic buttermilk pancakes, and they were excellent.  I had the Corned Beef Hash Skillet, and that was the best corned beef hash I've eaten.  The potatoes are thin sliced and sauted with onions, then the shaved corned beef is added toward the end to heat it through, using lean corned beef.  The flavor blend was perfect.  Prices were less than many other breakfast places in the area: All around excellent breakfast experience."}
{"text":"Pancakes? YES! Any egg thingy you could ever want? YES! Delicious? YES!  You can never go wrong with breakfast at Butters. It is always worth the wait. The staff if friendly, energetic and detail orientated."}
{"text":"First time there and had a great experience! Be prepared to wait for a bit, because this place's food is not a kept secret. The service was fantastic and our server gave his suggestions. The food came out quickly and was fantastic. Definitely a great place for breakfast/brunch. Potentially more suitable for families as there are no bloody marys or mimosas! Still great."}
{"text":"At first, our table was over looked but once brought to the attention of the staff our table was very accommodated. Food was absolutely delicious. Definitely recommend the chocolate chip pancakes to anyone with a morning sweet tooth."}
{"text":"I don't know how they make their eggs so fluffy, but I've never had anything like it! Delicious and like biting into a cloud. The cinnamon roll pancakes didn't even need any syrup they were SOOO good! The bacon was thick and flavorful. The coffee was smooth. Everything was delicious and worth the wait. We used the NoWait app to hold our place in line, but even on a Sunday morning, the wait wasn't more than about 20 mins. I would have happily waited an hour for that delicious of a meal. I can't recommend it enough!"}
{"text":"Woke up looking for a new good restaurant and found this one.  Although it's 45 minutes from Avondale it was worth the trip and the wait. The service was great and the food was tasty.  This will be my new Sunday breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"Great food for adults and kids. French toast, pancakes, skillet, and crepes were ordered during our visit.  Eggs were the fluffiest I've every had at a restaurant (that's a good thing!). Service was great and quick as can be. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"So far this is the best breakfast place I've been to in the valley! You need to get here early or you can expect a really long wait. The first time I tried to come here was around 10am on a Sunday and the wait was an hour and 45 minutes...we didn't stick around. We came back the following Saturday at 8am and still had about a 30 minute wait. Food was worth it!!! Their fresh squeezed OJ is the best thing I've ever tasted. Portions are huge too!"}
{"text":"This is a good breakfast. Comparable to Biscuits Cafe. A lengthy selection of breakfast sweets and omelet. No adult breakfast beverages offered. The iced latte came in a plastic to go cup which was funny at a sit down breakfast. No problem that would deter us from coming back, though! A small wait but definitely worth a good meal and good portion sizes!"}
{"text":"The place was packed on a Friday late morning. Cute place. I had the Marscapone stuffed crepes. Amazing. My waiter Antonio was good, even offering to give my refill of coffee to go. Nice touch. Why the 2 star review? Well, it would have been 5 stars, but the blonde food runner with a missing personality was continuously picking and wiping her nose without ever washing her hands. Super gross. I'll go back, but not if I see her working."}
{"text":"Hands down one of my favorite breakfast places in Scottsdale! I prefer this location to Butterfield's. The wait is never as long as they say, and the service is extremely fast! You can enjoy the sunshine and peaceful water fountain while waiting :)   Krystal did an amazing job at taking care of us today and keeping our coffee hot, on that note, I've never received bad service here!  The eggs are incredibly fluffy, like delicious fluffy egg clouds. Haha! I usually get the California Scramble, plenty of protein then add the protein pancakes for only $1!!! You can't beat that! And they are the BEST protein pancakes ever!   Today we got a little adventurous and ordered the Wildberry Bliss Cakes and Oreo Cookie S'Mores cakes. They were both amazing in their own way. Expect an extreme sugar high from the Oreo Cakes.   The only thing I would change would be to get a better roast of coffee. Other than that I really love this place! Thanks Butters for always making me happy!!"}
{"text":"I really loved this place.  We did have to wait like 15 mins but they gave us a buzzer and there was a lot of seating outside.  I don't know where to start, I guess I just love a breakfast place where they give big portions and the food is really knew and fresh.  I had the Country Beneditct -- their bendedict menu is perfection.  It was so good, you could taste the bacon in the gravy, it was delicious!  Didn't have any pancakes (huge regret).  I heard their french toast is fabulous too!  Great service, and tasty breakfast to start off your day!"}
{"text":"I love pancakes, but every time I go to breakfast, I forego them.  Somehow I talk myself into believing my 12-egg omelette with hash browns, bacon, and toast is \"healthier.\"  This explains my ever-shrinking wardrobe options when I have to wear clothing not blessed by elastic.  So for my birthday breakfast, I decided I was having pancakes and would not get swayed by a breakfast burrito.  And what better place to go than a restaurant with \"pancakes\" in its name.  And strawberry pancakes I had, along with bacon and OJ.  The pancakes were light, fluffy, and golden brown and stuffed with strawberries and a compote on top made of fresh berries as well.  The bacon was thick, apple-wood smoked cooked to perfection, crispy, yet not burnt in the slightest.  And the juice fresh squeezed, of course.  YUM!    I was glad it was a nice morning, and we were able to sit outside.  The dining room wasn't anything special, and it was really loud.  Although the patio overlooks Hayden, it was much quieter there.  If only they were open for dinner!"}
{"text":"It's tough being the top breakfast place in your city on Yelp. It draws in big crowds and even bigger expectations to live up to. Plus, with a name like Butters, how could you not want to try this place?  With minor jet lag throwing us into early-bird mode, we were seeking a delicious breakfast that opened before 8:00 AM. While brunchy-Scottsdale tends to wake up a bit later, we just couldn't wait on the late-birds; we were famished. We arrived just before 8 AM but already found the waiting crowds outside. Fortunately, despite the appearance, the wait for a table for 2 was only about 10 minutes. But a wait outside in the Arizona sun, even at 8 AM, can be quite a sweaty wait.  Once we were seated, we already had decided on our selections. The service is hear is incredibly fast; coffee served immediately and entrees within 5 minutes. I ordered the egg whites, turkey bacon, and hash browns along with their famous wildberry pancakes on the side.The amount of food was a bit daunting but I brought my appetite. The egg whites were nice and fluffy and the thick-sliced hash browns were a nice texture to me. The turkey bacon wasn't much to write about but turkey bacon usually isn't exciting. The wildberry pancakes were delicious but more like a dessert than breakfast. But I supposed that's the point? Overall the food was quite good.  The service here is polite but to the point. Don't expect chatty servers as they are working through big crowds and lots of tables. I think the food makes Butters so popular with it's well done sweet & traditional breakfast plates. Glad we stopped in here and would certainly return!"}
{"text":"Wow! I absolutely loved eating breakfast here!   The Wild Berry Bliss pancakes were truly amazing! I guess you can't go wrong with fluffy marscapone filled vanilla cream pancakes. We read other Yelp reviews and found this to be a fan favorite! If you ever want a true taste of happiness in your mouth, then I urge you to order this!  Irish Benny - For some reason, I've always loved the Irish fare of corned beef hash, but Butters restaurant decided to combine it ingeniously with eggs benedict, and voila! A match made in heaven! The hollandaise sauce covering eggs benedict with corned beef with a side of scalloped breakfast potatoes harmoniously complemented each other well, and I would not hesitate to order this dish again!  My hubby ordered the Mexicana omelet and the chorizo had just the right amount of spice. He couldn't stop talking about the right texture and fluffiness of his omelet either. He's always picky about how his omelets are prepared and they really hit the mark here!  Don't sweat the wait here, it is far worth it to experience breakfast here! I just wish it was a lot closer or at least had a branch on the northwest side of the valley because we would come here a lot  more if they did!"}
{"text":"Well anything with the word Butter in it you know its going to be good!  This place is one of the best breakfast places in Scottsdale.  The atmosphere and the wait staff are awesome!  Butters has a wide variety of breakfast foods but what they are know for are there pancakes.  You really cannot go wrong with any of their pancakes but I would recommend the Cinnamon Roll Pancakes.  The pancakes are exactly that.  Just imagine a cinnamon roll in pancake form.  No need for syrup on this one.  The next pancake you should go after would be the Protein Power Pancakes which are wheat pancakes, blueberries, oats & almonds.  You get the light fluffy pancake mixed with the crunch of the oats and the almonds then the sweetness of the blueberries.  These will fill you up!  You cannot go wrong with anything on the menu.  The food here is well worth the wait, and trust me you will have to wait.  If you have to wait you know there is good food (great indicator of good food just sucks waiting).  So, go get buttered up!

{"text":"This place is great. You get way too much food for your money, and ever part of it is delicious."}
{"text":"yummy Yummy.    The best pandcakes. So may options. I get it the way I like it...But weekends there is a wait. But worth it"}
{"text":"This place is a Butterfield's spin off and it's really solid.  Our scrambles were excellent and the kids breakfast at $3.99 was an outstanding value."}
{"text":"Very good! A lot of food for a good price. Must try the fresh squeezed OJ. Our server was polite, attentive and quick. But be prepared to wait for a table. For a table of 2 at 12:30, Quoted us 15 min, we were sat in 20. Overheard larger tables (6+) waiting 30+ min."}
{"text":"The best breakfast spot in Phoenix. It's worth the long wait. The berry pancakes are unique and absolutely the most tasty thing you'll eat."}
{"text":"I am a breakfast junkie and the Butters and Butterfield restaurants are a go-to favorite. Their specialty pancakes are awesome and all their ingredients are locally sourced. The only reason they aren't a 5 is because they took soy milk off the menu :( As someone  who can't have milk, it's the only thing that prevents me from visiting more often. Willie is a great server; ask for him!"}
{"text":"I am a breakfast foodie and this is by far the best quality breakfast in the valley. Dont be sucked in to the hype of other eateries, Butters food and service is always top notch. I enjoy sitting on the beautiful patio and sipping on a latte and munching on some French toast or eggs Benedict. Completely out of my way, but its worth the drive. Get there early because the wait begins around 9am."}
{"text":"Good food, fast service, well priced...we shared crepes, eggs w/chicken sausage (tasty) & pancakes. Portions are large. Espresso gets 2 thumbs up Orange juice is freshly squeezed & DELICIOUS"}
{"text":"I just had to write this review immediately after visiting.  I have to say I have never had a perfect dining experience before in my LIFE.... And thanks to the staff here it was flawless.  Before my drive back from the day after the Super Bowl where my Seahawks lost I was feeling down.  Looking to Yelp to find some comfort food before heading back to Los Angeles I find this place that was highly reviewed.  We walked in and immediately was greeted with a smile by the hostess and was whisked away to our table.  Within moments our waitress \"Monica\" greeted us with a smile and took our drink order.    When our food was delivered within 10 minutes and (I had the eggs Benedict) I found the poached egg to be PERFECTLY cooked.  The flavor clean and what was expected from a perfect Eggs Benedict.    After finishing the helpers pre-bussed while Monica kept on coming back to make sure we were taken care of.  We were in and out in less than 30 minutes (although we could've stayed longer we wanted to leave AZ as fast as we can to get back).  Nevertheless I will be back in 2 weeks for Breakfast.  Every entrepreneur should look at the way this place is run as a case study of how to run a restaurant."}
{"text":"Well, let's say that our experience did not start off well. We checked in at the hostess stand where they take your phone number so that they can both text and call you when your table is ready; we were told 20 minutes. After 25 minutes I checked to see how we were doing. I was told soon. After 45 minutes I said \" There are several groups that arrived after us that were seated already?\" At that point we received a huge apology because now they could not find my name in their system. We were seated promptly.   Twyla had gluten free waffles and a side of bacon (it was very salty). She loved her waffles and said that they were awesome! I had this corn tortilla stack with green chili sauce, cheese and an egg on top. Mine was quite good!   Our server Belle was the highlight of the day. She kept the service levels high and ensured that we had what we needed when we needed it. Thank you much. You helped take the edge off.  The patio is quaint and pleasant aspect to the restaurant. However, you get a great view of the parking lot (good people watching). There are some cool stores nearby and Costco is just up the road. Would I come back? The answer is yes. However, I want to see my name on the list prior to heading to the waiting area.  #Irishcatv2 #Vino2 #Vino2ultimate #Vinosquared"}
{"text":"I love their breakfast, the service is good too, but you have to get there before all the snowbirds, because it's right next to a resort, otherwise it's great"}
{"text":"Now that's an omelet!  Came here because yesterday is seen an interview of some baseball player who regulared at Butters. Had never been here before, driven by it many times, but never had the inclination to stop it till today. Place is small, maybe 20 tables, no diner counter too bad) coffee is fair to middling, they serve real cream or half and half with the coffee. Ordered a custom omelet, huge. For me, even. Two inches thick at the top, mine is loaded with bacon, sausage, cheddar, avocado and tomato. The hash browns are strictly potato, no onions or peppers. Ordered them crispy and they were. The omelets come with a side of toast or pancakes, so I am having the pancakes. The chunks of avocado are large and plentiful. The tomato is fresh, diced, no seeds. There's plentiful bacon and sausage cooked into the body of the omelet. The side of two pancakes are fine,they are fluffy, seems to be real whipped butter, their store-brand maple syrup has a good consistency, the cakes soak in the butter well. Could use some more butter but maybe I'll ask next time. There's a carafe of water with ice at the table, so I can serve myself as much water as I desire - I like that. The coffee flows pretty well, quick and seamless refills without having to ask.  Place is very crowded and quite busy, a huge mix of different types, some families, some couples, some onesies like me. I'd recommend this place to anyone for breakfast. Be warned, due to the popularity on a Wednesday morning, it must be a nightmare on the weekends!"}
{"text":"Classic breakfast place. Very plentiful servings. Pancakes are very fluffy and have different flavor options.  The fluffiest scrambled eggs I've ever tasted!  Great place for breakfast.  Service was very pleasant and fast!  Good coffee too!"}
{"text":"The Butterfield's brothers have done it again! Butters is everything I look for in a breakfast or lunch spot. It's open and airy, the staff is friendly and fast and the food is fantastic. Oh and did I mention that the patio is dog-friendly? All pluses in my book! Since so many of the reviews are about breakfast, I am going to talk about lunch!  Their wraps are amazing. The tortilla bread is soft and fresh and the combinations are mouthwatering. I ordered the Southwest Veggie Wrap with the addition of turkey. The wrap has Black beans, jalapeño cheese, corn, red bell pepper, avocado, scallion, lettuce, tomato & chipotle mayo. Every bite is better then the one before it. For my side, I splurged and ordered the sweet potato fries. Oh sweet happiness, I am so glad I did! The lunch was heartier than I typically opt for in the middle of the day, but when the food is this good, it doesn't quiet matter as much!   The server was friendly and efficient. In fact, I had only had 1/3 of my Diet Coke and she brought me out a new one! That's service. This is definitely a eatery that shouldn't be missed."}
{"text":"Very average, feels like an ihop. Inside, expect your chair to be super close to your neighbor. The outside is more comfortable, with sturdy plastic(?) orange chairs. They have an awning that opens when overcast, closes when sunny.  They have a coffee counter in the front. I did not try this and I'm glad I didn't waste time; the coffee I had with my meal was the worst ever. I had to drink it for the caffeine unfortunately.  I had the berry pancakes. There is a bland almost sour tasting cream cheese filling in the center. It was awful.  I'm giving 2stars instead of one because the service was friendly and pleasant and I likes the outdoor patio. And the bathroom decor-think orange, bright, flowers, and glitter. The bathroom itself might be worth a trip back to show my daughter"}
{"text":"Best breakfast ever!!! The veg omelette with the strawberry pancakes was wonderful along with fresh squeezed orange juice. Had the wild berry french toast for brunch the next day. Wish we had one of these near Akron, Ohio!!!! We have nothing that compares."}
{"text":"Always a favorite. Good food and friendly staff. Excellent coffee. Cheese grits are perfection."}
{"text":"We sat outside on a beautiful weekday morning and had a great meal. No complaints whatsoever about that! But the waitress must have been having a bad day; she acted mad when we asked for coffee refills and removed our plates when we weren't finished!?! Not an inexpensive place so we would have appreciated just a little better attitude from our server and it would have been 5 stars!"}
{"text":"If you're willing to wait for a truly great breakfast then you should come here. They have lots of choices but the skillets are our personal favorite items. Homemade orange juice tasting just like grandmas did. Overall, the food is hard to beat but the restaurant environment is nothing special."}
{"text":"Everything we've tried on the menu has been exceptional! Butters is our go-to breakfast spot. I'd highly recommend the Wildberry Bliss Pancakes. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Our first time here!   It was okay.  They are super busy and bustling.   The waitress was efficient but not overly friendly.  The food was not as great as anticipated!   The coffee was excellent!   Overall just a 3 star."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Great eggs and pancakes. Highly recommend! These were some of the best eggs we've had and lots of interesting pancake choices. The bacon was also fantastic!"}
{"text":"ordered: - create your own omelette [mushroom, avocado, jack cheese, bacon] + banana cream cakes  pros: - seated quickly even when busy, seats are comfortable, bathrooms always clean - huge portions, reasonably priced - pancakes are delicious [get banana or wildberry] - food comes out quick af - servers are polite, check back often, never had an incorrect order or had to send anything back  cons: - no sriracha [ive asked em if they have it every time ive gone for the past year lol; is it hard to add some bottles of sriracha to that sysco order?] - every time i ask for \"crispier\" hash browns, they say they cant change it and that it \"already comes out crispy\" which imo it doesnt"}
{"text":"Great food & friendly service every time! Best orang juice around. I don't go out for breakfast often, but when I do, this is the place!"}
{"text":"Not sure why everyone raves about this place!  Honestly wasn't that impressed with the breakfast I had!  I didn't mind the wait time on Sunday, but was really annoyed at having to wait another 10 or more minutes just to get a cup of coffee once seated, as well as the lack of attention paid to us during our meal.  At one point, I had to ask another server for refills, cause our server was MIA. The Brioche French Toast and chicken sausage I ordered was nothing special and my companion's omelet didn't impress either.  They sure didn't try to dress up the dishes in any way (no little garnishes of any sort like you would expect) and our food looked like it was thrown on the plate haphazardly.  I will say that the grits looked yummy, but again the portion size was disappointing.   To spend $29 without tip for a breakfast for two also seems high, so I don't expect to be back anytime soon!"}
{"text":"dang gummit....how much tastier can breakfast get???? worth a 30 minute wait on a sunday morning? i guess so!  i ordered the wildberry pancakes....3 medium sized pancakes, stuffed with marscapone, drizzled with a wildberry compote, with a side of blueberries and strawberries. it took me about 3 minutes! it was delicious (and i was hungry after my mtn bike ride).   my buddy ordered an omelette....with a side of bacon. not really knowing how gigantic their portions are. he could only eat half his omelette and potatoes it was just so much food. he said the food was \"damn, thas good\".  i just think their menu has tons of great looking/tasting food. i would love to check all their items off my list!   on cooler days, i'm sure they open the patio, but it's just too darn hot right now.  breakfast entrees range from 7-9 bucks average."}
{"text":"Butters was recommended to me by a family member and after I checked the reviews, I knew it had to happen. We came here for Brunch on a Tuesday around 11:30. For a weekday morning, the place was packed! Despite the crowd, we were seated outside after a 5 minute wait. Dining Partner and I were craving both sweet and savory dishes so we split the wild berry bliss pancakes and California scramble. The pancakes were light and fluffy and the vanilla mascarpone with the mix of berries was absolute heaven. The California scramble was packed with chicken and avocado. We were in and out in less than an hour and our waitress was friendly. There was so many other things on the menu we would have loved to try. Will be back for sure the next time we are in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great menu. It gets busy, so expect a wait. I like their egg breakfasts, and of course  the pancakes."}
{"text":"Fave spot to get breakfast in Scottsdale. We sit outside on the patio in the morning sun and the food is excellent. Large portions that are cooked perfectly. Also appreciate the gluten free awareness."}
{"text":"My review will be short as limited words are needed for this heavenly treasure nested in the great city of Scottsdale. My husband and I have seriously considered flying back to Phoenix just have eat BRUNCH! I would double the stars above if Yelp! Would let me."}
{"text":"The hash browns were amazing! French toast really good, service excellent, seated and served so fast. The cobb salad was good, not spectacular, too much egg. Definitely will go there again when we're back in town!!!"}
{"text":"Really great spot, excellent food and service I would highly recommend this eatery...... i would ranks this one a world class must go too spot...."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat breakfast. When I go out for breakfast, I usually order something difficult to make at home but here I order the scrambled eggs. Yes, scrambled eggs.. They make the best by whipping the eggs to make them fluffy and creamy. At first I thought they put something in them but later found out it is whipped. Oh and the buttermilk pancakes (comes with the two egg plate) are out of this world. The only negative thing is, if you have never been there before, it is tough to find from the parking lot because it is in the back corner but you can see the sign from the street."}
{"text":"The place was amazing I got the eggs Benedict all was good I very much like the crepes and most of all the cream banana pancakes  everything was great more then I thought definitely worth the drive."}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast spots in Scottsdale! Amazing food and really good coffee!"}
{"text":"I love the samon omelet here. The menu is full of great flavor and health focused options.  The oreo pancakes are a very tasty option for those with a sweet tooth.  Can't wait to return with my family next year when we visit.   Service is pretty terrible, but i try to forget about it."}
{"text":"Dang. It's always disappointing to be let down by a meal, but even more so when your experience pretty clearly goes against the Yelpy grain of goodness. It was beautiful pictures of corned beef hash that brought me into highly acclaimed Butters, but it was the corned beef hash that let me down.   Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?  If there's one place where Butters doesn't disappoint, it's with their service and atmosphere. While the lines can really stack up, especially in the winter, the flow is efficient, and the servers on top of tables even on a crowded day. No complaints. Star Granted.   Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?  While I didn't take a picture, my corned beef hash skillet was sizable, and partially thanks to the wheat toast, I was good and full by the end of it. At $9.45, it was reasonable for corned beef, which usually warrants a premium. Having said that, you might shortly learn why it was as cheap as it was. Star Granted.   Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?  Gah. It was here that things more or less fell apart, and we'll go top down in our analysis here. The eggs? Fine. There wasn't any uniqueness here, but there didn't necessarily need to be - they were eggs. The corned beef was the biggest letdown, as it was pretty clear that the corned beef hash used was straight out of the can. I could be wrong, but if I am, it was very, very bad freshly made corned beef hash. Bland flavor, standardized, factory consistency, and all in all not a great experience. I'd hoped that maybe the potatoes would save the skillet, but they weren't as crispy as I'd hoped. All in all, this was essentially just a sum of mediocre parts as opposed to the flavorful skillet that it could have been. No Stars Granted.   Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?  Scottsdale is stacked on great breakfast options, and while I could have shown up on an off day or ordered the wrong dish, my visit to Butters pancakes didn't 'stack' up. No Star Granted."}
{"text":"This was the best breakfast I have ever had. Everything coffee, OJ, eggs, service was outstanding. Only draw back was the long wait to get in but it is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Man it always seems to be so incredibly busy here. It was a 45min - 1hr wait on a weekend but we got right in on a weekday. Though just barely because the room was packed!  The seating is odd. It's like they tried to fit tables in where they could. We almost touched elbows with the table next to us from our booth, it was that close.   Ambience is loud and just an overall crowded feeling. Almost claustrophobic. Kids are out of control here but that's not on the restaurant. Just very kid and baby friendly here.   I got the wild berry bliss pancakes which were good. Not too sweet. It's blueberry filled pancakes with mascarpone cream in between and a drizzle of strawberry sauce and vanilla cream. It comes with a generous side of berries as well. That mascarpone cream was delicious.    BF got a wild hog skillet. The size was very small and honestly, it did not look much different from those skillets you get at Denny's. Just a smaller size for a greater price.   The OJ is fresh but I prefer the ones at Original Breakfast House. Personal preference.   Overall place is definitely ok. French toast and pancakes seem to be the stars here. I wouldn't go out of my way to come back simply because of the crowdedness and more than likely long wait."}
{"text":"Mediocre quality omelette. Didn't give me the right sides but I ordered take out. I can't give them more than 2 stars but I didn't try their pancakes which they specialize in. I just think the price for this small  and tasteless omelette was not worth $12"}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place! They have the best orange juice you could ever imagine and pancakes you will dream about!!! I always get something different to eat when I go, and it's a whole new adventure every time! Not only is the food amazing, every staff member I have been in contact with is absolutely lovely. Super nice and will go out of their way to make it a great experience. I will drive out of my way, 40 mins from north Glendale just to come here! BEST IN THE VALLEY! If you haven't tried Butters, PLEASE DO! You will not be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Why mess with a good thing.   My coworker and I came to town on business and read some funny reviews of jealous girlfriends and the servers. Great place and the good is great. We ate here back to back."}
{"text":"Definitely a go to place.. had about a 35min wait for a table on a Saturday, but worth it! Protein pancakes are out of this world good as well as the Mexican scramble.. their orange juice is so fresh you can't only have 1 glass! Will 100% come back again"}
{"text":"Just had my birthday breakfast here and it is excellent.  The food and coffee here are a cut above.  The bacon was obviously of a very high quality.  Everything from the eggs, to the pancakes to the toast was simply delicious.  This place is a winner!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Ordered Chorizo scramble with avocados, etc.   The buttermilk pancakes heavenly.   Customer service Excellent."}
{"text":"The best breakfast I ever did have! The food and service were top notch. And the outdoor seating was the icing on the cake."}
{"text":"Soooo yummy!t The wait was long on a Saturday at 10am but worth it! (40 minutes)  We got the Oreo Smores pancakes (my fave)  Wild berry crepes, and banana cream French toast.  And a vegetarian omelet to break up the sweet!  All huge portions-- although the pancakes, French toast, and crepes do not come with a \"side\" of anything.   This was the best breakfast we had on vacation. :)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped by for a quick breakfast while our car was getting washed and were very pleased.  I ordered the Irish Benedict and he ordered the Santa Fe Scramble.  The first time I received my Benedict, the eggs were overcooked.  I brought it to the attention of our waitress and she apologized profusely and took it away.  Just a few seconds later, the manager (who was also working in the kitchen--yay management that helps!) came out, apologized, and assured us that it would be brought out correct and in just a few minutes.  It came out just a few minutes later and it was cooked perfectly!  Both dishes were extremely tasty and I am super impressed that the manager came out to check on us again.  We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Great pancakes and really great service. Prices were very reasonable for the great quality food. It's not a fancy occasion place but it's perfect for a quick breakfast with a close friend before work. Food portions are generous so it's great for sharing. I'd go again if I was in the area!"}
{"text":"Their cheese grits are the best grits I have ever had...and this is in Arizona!!!  Fresh squeezed orange juice and flavorful dishes, makes Butters, my favorite breakfast place."}
{"text":"This place was quite busy when I went, there was a bit of a wait, and I completely understand why! Their breakfast is absolutely fantastic. Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day, eggs are my favorite breakfast food, and Butters delivered.   One thing I love about this place is that there are options to meet different dietary needs. I wanted something a little healthier that day so I got a build your own omelette. I had egg whites with avocado and spinach, and substituted fruit for potatoes.   Quite possibly the best thing about this place is you can get pancakes instead of toast on the side. No upcharge. PANCAKES! And those pancakes are fluffy and delightful and I want some now.  Did not have any real issues with the service here. I highly recommend this place, it is awesome."}
{"text":"one of the best breakfast restaurants i have gone to!great biscuits and gravy. and great country fried steak. server wass kind and helpful. recomend to anyone looking for a great breakfast!"}
{"text":"Typical breakfast spot. I'm happy we came here but I wasn't completely blown away. We got the New Mexico skillet and it was delicious. We also got the mixed berry pancakes. You have to get the pancakes!!! I don't even care for pancakes but after reading reviews I knew we had to get them and was so happy we did! It was a little too sweet with the cream in the middle so we just ate around it. But plenty of berries no need for syrup and oh so moist and fluffy. I would for sure come back for more pancakes! We luckily didn't have to wait since we came on a Thursday morning around 10am. If the wait is longer than 40min, I would probably pass. But check this place out. And get the pancakes!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome.    We were there on Father's Day and had to wait about 45 minutes. But it was worth it.  And busy as they were, the food was the star.   Perfectly poached eggs set off the country bennies which consisted of buttermilk biscuits, patty sausages, and cream gravy.  I chose hash browns instead of grits and had them add bacon, mushrooms and onions to the hash.  They were very generous with the extras and the applewood bacon slivers were plentiful and large.    Two of my table mates got the mushroom, onion, bacon skillet meals with two eggs on top.  One got the eggs over medium, the other cooked through.  One had the mushrooms excluded.  Both chose pancakes instead of toast.  One got the pecan and the other banana.  I also had the pecan pancakes.   Wow!!  They had great flavor. Perfect texture.  Light crunch on the griddled surface and fluffy flavorful body.  Mmmmm.   My wife and friend split and  shared their banana and pecan order to get both flavors.  The House syrup was good too.    Thank you Yelp for pointing us here.  We are town for vacation and will definitely be back here before we leave.   Extra info.  I don't know if they have them everyday but they had coffee and little round rolls of various flavors including chocolate in the waiting area.    The coffee/espresso  bar inside is not as good as Starbucks to me but I enjoyed the white chocolate mocha.  My wife's cold caramel macchiato was pretty good too.   We were scared at first that our server was going to be a cardboard person.  Her face was stoic she she did t chit chat at all. She always seemed to be giving us half her attention but as the meal progressed, we learned she was tracking all her tables' needs all the time.  Empty drink glasses were replaced nearly as fast as they hit the table.  She did't smile a lot but she did take care of us and kept our complex split ticket order with off menu changes straight."}
{"text":"Saturday morning at9:30 am and a twenty minute wait. Seated almost exactly twenty minutes later. Ordered the chocolate chip waffles. $9.50. Had to get the syrup off another table.  Chocolate must have been semi sweet as there was a bite to it but overall very good."}
{"text":"Are their this past weekend and food and service were great. There is usually a wait on Sunday mornings, but the app you can use to track your place in line helps you know where you are on the list and is good customer service!  I highly recommend the cinnamon roll pancake!"}
{"text":"Went with this brunch spot based on average reviews and was not disappointed.  Sunday at noon there was a wait, but that's to be expected.  The hostess was friendly and once we got seated our waitress made a few suggestions and the orders were placed.  Prices were reasonable, fresh squeezed OJ was delicious and not outrageously priced, and we shared the eggs benedict, New Mexico scramble and their wild berry pancakes with mascarpone...   A great eggs bennie almost always comes down to the hollandaise - and this was no exception, spot on delicious.  The hash browns were nice and crispy and the pancakes were delicious without being too sweet.  Service was great and my only suggestion when you come here is try to arrive before 9 to avoid the wait.  I'll be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"We loved our entire experience. Staff was friendly, restaurant was comfortable, food and drinks were excellent! I loved my california scramble with potatoes, mocha and fresh squeezed juice. My son was very happy with his omlette and smoothie, and my husband enjoyed the corned beef hash and grits...and everything came with pancakes!!!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast on outdoor patio made our morning!  Nice fine in Scottsdale where we were vacationing and had no idea which local hangouts would be good for breakfast.  Had to wait in a bit of a line but well worth it once the pancakes came out."}
{"text":"A solid, consistent option for breakfast.  Service was quick and efficient. Only drawback was the overwhelming tones of Selena Gomez and Backstreet Boys, not my preferred choice first thing in the morning. My wife was overwhelmed with food as her omelet came with a short stack of blueberry pancakes, which were delicious. Portions were excellent, if a bit much."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast food.  Scrambled eggs are fluffy.  Their chicken sausage tastes amazing.  The potatoes are done differently, more like homemade feel vs hash brown style that you get everywhere else.  Great choice for breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. They have great service!!! I got seated quickly and love having the pitcher of water on the table. Makes it easier to fill when needed and not have to wait for a waiter.   The food is great! You can eat here whether you are a health freak or a heavy eater. Either way, your meal comes with plenty of food. California I had the waffles and share a egg benedicts . They also serve freshly squeeze orange juice. Real orange juice!!! A bit expensive for the orange juice but it is worth it if you like orange juice"}
{"text":"We took my daughter & grandson (10mos) for an early Sunday morning breakfast. It was the first nice morning, weather wise, and would have been a wonderful morning to have breakfast outside. I have fond memories of this restaurant & dining outside when it was \"The Good Egg\". When we arrived we found out that we could not sit outside in the beautiful morning air because they didn't have enough servers. It would have been simple & easy to sit us outside and have one of the servers walk thru the doors to serve us. The way the restaurant is set up its just a couple of extra steps to the outside. Very short sighted thinking.  The manager was not very welcoming, never smiling or indicating that we were welcome guests as should happen in a restaurant setting. When ordering we requested something simple, like adding cottage cheese to scrambled eggs, in order to make it softer for the baby to eat. We were told that the \"boss\" didn't like to make changes to the menu but she would ask. They did end up doing it but when they brought it out, it was unbelievable, it looked like they'd added a whole pint of cottage cheese to one egg. They redid it and it was just okay. With all of the competition in Scottsdale you would think that they would do all they could to make a customer happy.  I probably will think twice about bringing my business back to this restaurant. This restaurant needs to work on their customer service & their attitudes. Their food is good, except for the pancakes, which are dry and fall apart when you cut into them.  Altogether a disappointing experience."}
{"text":"The wait is often long here, which is understandable as the food is good. The wait staff is generally attentive and friendly, but the host staff of aloof and adds to the long wait times. They are unable to effectively sit large parties in proper order. The manager on staff is smug and not customer service oriented.   Expect to wait an hour or more on the weekend for parties of 5 or more.   My recommendation to ownership is to change management and host staff. This is the last time I eat here."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Arizona. My go-to is the whole hog skillet, berry bliss pancakes and fresh squeezed OJ. Amazing food and great service. The wait can be long on the weekends (around 30 minutes) but trust, it is so worth it!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times, every time there is a minimum of 45 min wait. The food exceeded our expectations every time. Well worth the wait."}
{"text":"This is my most favoritest breakfast joint EVER! I used to live in the area and come by at least once a week. Now that I moved for a job (nurse probs) I am not as close but still try to come as often as I can. Everything that I've had here has been literally mind blowing good! I love their Eggs Benedict Wildberry Bliss Crepes, and Popeye Scrambler! And here's another tip, ask for protein pancakes and get ready for your life to change forever! Everything here is good, from the coffee, fresh squeezed juice, and the service.   Service here has consistently been five stars for me. I've always had great, quick, friendly servers who get the order correct the first time and always anticipate everything we're going to need. They offer all kinds of sauces, Tabasco, syrup for the pancakes everything you could possibly need! Did I mention the food comes out so fast! So if you have a slow friend it's OK to let them order after you because their food will be out just as fast lol! I've even noticed the quality of the bussers. They're always coming by to clear unused plates and make room for you on the table and are also very friendly. I consistently hear other patrons asking to speak to the manager-normally this would be a scary thing for a server but every time the customer comments on how good of an experience they had and I 100% agree. This will be my breakfast spot for life!"}
{"text":"Butters is a fantastic place to go for breakfast, brunch or lunch. Service is always very friendly, the kitchen is amazingly fast, and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"I had this place bookmarked for about two years, finally had a chance to try here this morning.   Past several times, whenever I came, wait was 45-60 mins. Finally came at 8:20am and was told 20 mins wait. Gave my cell phone number, waited for about 10 mins when I received text message that my table is ready!   Service was very prompt, so efficient. Food came out fairly quick.  Based on reviews, tried bacon Belgium waffles. Bacon is inside the waffles as well as on top. Salty bacon and sweet waffles were perfect combination.   Also tried my ultimate favorite breakfast, classic egg benedict. It came with hash browns. Never had this kind, potato was sliced thin, parts of it was a tad burned but good taste for sure. Egg benedict tasted like egg benedict should taste like.  Best part was freshly squeezed orange juice. It tasted so good, wished they served it with champagne.   Most food was just about $10 each, great price, fast service, no wonder why they have a long wait on weekend morning."}
{"text":"I met some clients here for lunch the other day.  Well, at least, they had lunch.   I had pancakes.   So I guess it's breakfast for lunch.    That's fair.   I do breakfast for dinner as well.  I decided on the w i l d b e r ry  b l i s s  c a k e s.   I must admit, it gives Snooze a run for its money on this one.   (Or maybe it's the other way around??)  They were blissfully light and fluffy filled with blueberries and cream and topped with more cream.     My clients had a sandwich and a salad.   Since they had recommended this place, I am assuming they liked it.     Sorry I don't know who the server was, but competent and friendly all the same.   It's not jam packed with customers like Snooze is, which I'm surprised.  Would I return?   You bet!"}
{"text":"This place was beyond my expectations! Super fast service on a busy morning, great tasting food, and we'll worth the price I paid. Would recommend this place to visitors. I ordered the eggs benedict with chocolate chip pancakes, superb!"}
{"text":"Uhm. Whaaaaaat. The size of the omelets here KILLS ME!!!! In a good way.  I love eggs, so I had a mini heart attack when I snuck a peek at a few neighboring tables' dishes. Delicious, and non-greasy! the hashbrowns are perfectly crisped (although I do like mine a TEENSY bit more on the brown side) and CLEAN! oh so beautifully clean.  This is the cleanest breakfast joint I've ever been to. Love.  To top off your morning (or start it right), stop by Village Coffee Roastery (right next door) before or after and get the best latte.   Happy food comas to you!"}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast spot EVER. From quick seating, friendly service, and piping hot food this café nails it on every level. The large portions for the great prices, you really are getting the 'Bang For Your Buck' here."}
{"text":"Its amazing how on point everything is here, timing, attentiveness of staff, service, no matter how slammed they are! Quality of food is PERFECT, fluffy omelets, hot coffee...i have no idea how they do, it's the best oiled machine ever!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed every dish. Everything homemade. Not a dirty plate when we finished. We licked them clean. Reasonable priced too."}
{"text":"We drove all the way over here from the west valley (almost an hour drive) and we will do it again in a heartbeat! The food was OUTSTANDING! The service was attentive and friendly. Food came out fast. The coffee was incredible and the fresh squeezed OJ look very delicious. The pancakes were fluffy and perfectly complimented the toppings. We had the wildberry and the cinnamon pancakes. This place is a gen and I hope they get one in the west valley soon!!"}
{"text":"The wildberry bliss  cakes were awesome!  And the Irish Benny too!!!  By far the best breakfast I've had in Phoenix in a long long time.  This place was amazing and we'll be back...  I don't give five stars often, but this place rocked it - just watch out for the bees out on the patio."}
{"text":"Went the other day with my son, and it was fantastic! The fresh orange juice is amazing!  I had the wild berry french toast and it was really good."}
{"text":"OMG! OMG! OMG!  I am the \"designated Foodie\" now with my group of friends and its my job to find us great places to eat when we are out of town.  So prior to arriving in Scottsdale I had done my due diligence and had YELPED breakfast places.  Breakfast is my favorite meal and I have high standards. We were only going to have one day of our trip where we were going to have time for breakfast so I had to make my pick.  Five stars is not enough for this place.  First we were greeted by the owner.  The family is from Chicago and they have been in the restaurant business for many decades. He made us feel so at home.  For those that love omelettes, without a doubt they make THE FLUFFIEST omelets I have ever had. Just beautiful and delicious.  On to the Pancakes- you CAN NOT go here without having the pancakes.  I ordered the Pecan Pancake and it was so good!  One of my friends had  Strawberry Pancakes and said they were heavenly.  Chocolate Chip Pancakes were scrumptious.  Then the owner brought us out the MOST DELICIOUS Vanilla Bean \"icing\" to put on the pancakes.  He said they make it for the Wild Berry Pancakes but he said we had to try it. Holy Smokes I could live on that stuff.  They make it by grinding fresh vanilla beans..... Need I say more.  My one friend said it was \"The Best Breakfast of her life\".  I have to say its definitely up there as my best all time breakfast as well.  I hope we have to go back to Scottsdale in the near future and Butters is one of the reasons why!"}
{"text":"Kick ass food! We had the Santa Fe Scrambler- its got GREAT flavor, a perfect level of spice (when adding Cholula as well ;) ) and the Whole Hog Skillet, which had ALL. OF. THE. MEATS. (literally).   Service was speedy gonzalez fast, server was friendly and helpful with questions re: menu.   All in all, awesome place for breakfast, we couldn't have been happier.  Yay!"}
{"text":"I am a lover of pancakes, and Butters pancakes are now at the top of my list! They were cooked to perfection. The setting of the restaurant is your typical breakfast style atmosphere. I sat outside, and there were misters to keep you cool. The service was great, and I loved my food. If you do go to Butters you must get the OJ! It is so fresh!! If you are in the are and are looking for a good breakfast place with a variety of items to choose from give Butters a try. It will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Best breakfast spot in AZ, hands-down. Whether you are looking for a healthy egg white omelet or looking to indulge in something like the cinnamon roll cakes, everything tastes GREAT. Only downside is that they can get pretty busy on the weekends, but it's only a sign of just how great the food is. Large portions, excellent services. A+"}
{"text":"What an amazing breakfast on their beautiful patio. I tried the eggs which came with potatoes or grits as well as pancakes or toast. Ended up with potatoes and pecan pancakes... entire meal was out of the world good! Heather our server was so sweet and helpful. Great experience!"}
{"text":"Sooooo good!!! Went to Az to surprise the boyfriends Dad for his 70th birthday and we went to eat here! Oh my we were all so pleased!!!! So many different options and they have FRESH squeezed orange juice!!!! Our favorite!!!!!!! The best!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Very pleasantly surprised. Just happened to find this place on the way to the airport. Was surprisingly busy for a Monday morning but we were early enough that we got seated right away. The pancakes are quite delicious. Light, fluffy. The huevos rancheros were decent but I really liked the corned beef hash. Service was also good.  Would definitely go back if in the area again."}
{"text":"Just deliciousness going on here is all I can say if you need a great breakfast this is it the staff was great in the food was so good I wanna take a trip just to get second in thirds lol"}
{"text":"Well, we knew that the wait was going to be long, a full hour. No surprise there. However, the food being undercooked is not what I would expect. Scrambled eggs should never be runny. Just gross. Even the omelet was undercooked.     The pancakes should be out of this world if that's part of the name of the place. They were crispy. Huh? Pancakes are supposed to be fluffy. The hash browns were bland, no salt or pepper even. Just not impressed by this place."}
{"text":"I have been a regular customer of Butters Pancakes and Café for several years.  The food is consistently delicious and the service consistently exceeds my expectations.  I highly recommend visiting this wonderful restaurant."}
{"text":"This last sunday was our second time being here, and boy oh boy, we definitely love this place! When we got here at 10:30 there was a 30 minute wait, which wasnt bad as crowded as it was.. When we were sat our server Heather was pretty quick with getting our order and recommended I add pancakes to my order for 99 cents rather than paying for a full order that I won't finish. Great tip!  I got the New Mexico Skillet with eggs over easy and a side of Oreo S'more chocolate chip pancakes! Can you say I am in Heaven!! It was sooo freaking delicious I want to copy these pancakes and make them every morning!!  My BF got the Santa Fe scrambler (which is weird because he doesn't like chorizo but he loves it here), Taffy Apple Toast and a side of Cinnamon Roll Cakes ( which he says he got for me lol).. And a glass of milk.  All that food came out in less than 15 minutes! We were surprised!  Everything was devoured in minutes!   The best part wasn't just the food, the price for all that food was only around $30!!  We will definitely keep coming here!"}
{"text":"I love their breakfasts!! Prices are also responsible navel, the only issue is that the place is always packed!! :)"}
{"text":"Excellent fast service. Food was simply awesome. We had wild berry pancakes, 2 egg breakfast with amazing bacon and the Mexican burrito that my husband said was delicious.  This will be a stop we make everytime we visit Phoenix"}
{"text":"Good coffee, excellent pancakes and fresh squeezed orange juice? Yes, the best breakfast place in Scottsdale and possibly the 3 nearest states."}
{"text":"Butters used to be one of my favorite breakfast places. Great food and great service! however i have started to notice the quality of the food starting to decline which is such a shame. I got the smoked salmon platter and it wasn't as fresh as I would have liked. This has happened to me probably twice. I also got the eggs benedict and it was super runny almost as if it was barely poached. Although I used to go to butters a couple times a month without complaint these incidents were my most recent visits to butters causing me to second guess my choice of going back."}
{"text":"Save your money and go to Denny's because this place isn't as good.  Service is not very good. You will find yourselves asking multiple times for basic things like real coffee cups. They prefer to give you paper cups -- and you have to yell Ito the waitress to get more of the lousy coffee. Blech!  If you have to wait for a table be prepared to pay for the lousy coffee upfront. They should be giving this stuff away for free to power diesel engines.   The coffee tastes like something you would buy in a small town Circle K. At least they have whole cream to dissipate the taste!  The food is very bland.  I have been here twice and it was just as bad both times. I would give it two stars because it's next to a very good coffee roaster, but they obviously prefer Christian Bros instead. So, why don't they go next door and buy their coffee? Stupidity? Ego?"}
{"text":"Decent breakfast spot with all the usual suspects. Nothing special or memorable in my book. Definitely a step above Denny's thougb"}
{"text":"Mm, French crepes with glazed berries and a New Mexico Skillet.... I sadly didn't dine in however the lobby looked pretty busy for a Tuesday! But I was able to order a couple of things to-go for my boyfriend and I.  They have this yummy New Mexico skillet that comes with your choice of eggs any style, cheese, onions, tomatoes, peppers and avocados!!! And they put a good amount for me. We also ordered the Wildberry French Crepe. It was good but I think it would've been a little better if the edges were a bit crispier. I liked the filling but not so much my fruits glazed. It was still delicious though! Would definitely come back if in town again! With two entrees came out to about $23! Woo hoo!"}
{"text":"I found amazing pancakes in Scottsdale! Thank goodness! I was starting to lose faith. I also had cheesy grits, bacon, and poached eggs. Poached eggs were overlooked but waitress replaced kindly and the cook got it right the second time around.  Definitely have to try the wildberries pancakes.  Oh, and syrup is good too!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast options and good food at an affordable price. Good and fast service. Oh, and the bathrooms are clean!!!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for breakfast before a shopping trip on a Saturday. There was a decent wait but that is to be expected given it was a weekend.  They take your number and text you when your table is ready so you don't have to wait inside.  Once we were seated we were immediately greeted by our server, I believe his name was Willie, he was extremely friendly and on top of everything from refills to extra cream and sugar.  I had a breakfast skillet, the eggs were fluffy and everything was cooked perfectly.  It came with pancakes that were also very good.  It is a little bit out of my way but I would definitely return and highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This is my second time here in 3 years, only bcuz I live out of state. I don't eat eggs but they have a skillet you can order sans eggs or you can just order the two eggs option with no eggs and it's still a pretty good deal. Our waitress was Mackenzie and she was very hospitable, and knew her menu well."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing breakfast and the orange juice was phenomenal! Would totally recommend this to anyone that loves a great breakfast!"}
{"text":"Absolutely my favorite breakfast spot!! The wait is always at least 30 minutes on the weekends but it's so worth it. The pancakes are always good, the fresh squeezed OJ, the salsa verde eggs are to die for!! Honesty you can't do wrong with anything you order."}
{"text":"The fresh squeezed orange juice is a plus. Not cheap but really good food. Worth the price."}
{"text":"Wowie Zowie !! 5 full stars. Food Great, Servers Great Fresh OJ out of this world !!! Had Breakfast outside Perfect weather Perfect Day !!"}
{"text":"This place gets busy busy busy!! However they have some very good food! I personally loved the fresh OJ!! Once you have fresh squeezed orange juice. You will never want it out the carton. The pancakes are splendid! A lot of variety and they offer \"healthy\" options!"}
{"text":"Visiting here for a week and we found this place too late in our visit. This is one of the best breakfast's I have had in a very long time. Service was quick and very attentive. If ever in this area again this will be my first choice for breakfast."}
{"text":"Easily.... The BEST breakfast I've ever had!!!! I'm a bit of a French toast addict. No matter where I go I will always go for the French toast, so I've had it all. I've traveled all over the country and even in parts of the world and with breakfast as my favorite meal of the day, I mean it when I say Butters has the best French Toast I've ever had!!  The only bad thing? I don't live in Arizona! So unfortunately I have to buy a plane ticket to come back. But rest assured, I WILL be back!"}
{"text":"I seriously did not know this was a smaller version of Mrs. Buttersfileds. The wait time was super long and the dining area was super tight. Food is just as good as the mother restaurant. I recommend Butters if you are ever in the area."}
{"text":"Delicious!! Everything on the menu is fantastic! This was my first time here and I will definitely be back. Bacon was crispy, eggs were fluffy, the grits were creamy and amazing and if course the buttermilk pancakes were perfect. To top it all off the staff was very attentive and friendly!!! A+++ I can't wait for my next visit!"}
{"text":"Third time here,today with a party of eight service was excellent food also very very good"}
{"text":"Happy halloween!!!! It was Easter the last time we were here. We had the california scrambler, protein pancake and veggie omelette. This time we are going on the not so healthy side if the menu. We ordered their fresh squeezed orange juice, mocha blended capuccino, the cheese blintzes french crepes, taffy apple sourdough french toast and the smoked salmon & cream cheese scrambler.   Just like the last time, service was quick. The orange juice and capuccino was out on our table fast. The orange juice was sweet and refreshing. The capuccino, it was creamy and the mocha flavor was strong enough to make my taste buds crave for more.  Food we ordered was out a few minutes after the drinks came out. Big portions!!! 2 persons can share on the scrambler and still feel satisfied.   The smoked salmon & cream cheese scrambler had a lot of good points and some low points. The onion, cream cheese and smoked salmon worked well. The smoked salmon just had enough saltiness and the smoky finish works well with the cream cheese. The smoked salmon, cream cheese, onion and egg in one bite creates a good balance. I missed a little kick if spice which was aided by the hot sauce on the table. Since every bite did not have cream cheese and salmon, I would have wanted a little salt or garlic powder on the egg. (Just to add... The hashbrowns were awesome)  The cheese blintzes french crepes were a little overwhelming. I felt that there was a little too much filling that it took away the balance between the crepe and filling. It was OK. Maybe a little too OK. I think it might work better if it was folded with the filling instead of rolled like a burrito. The fresh strawberries and stawberry sauce are required on every bite. There were just too much ricotta and cottage cheese on every bite. Maybe this would work for the cottage cheese lovers.  The Taffy apple sourdough french toast was a little dry for my taste but the flavors were spot on. No one can go wrong with the combination of apple, caramel, and cinnamon. The apples were the perfect texture. Soft but still had a bite on it which paired well with the pecan sprinkled on the plate. A little more caramel or maybe addig some caramel in between the toast might help eliminate some of the dryness.  Again, good service and above average food. Nothing that would stop me from visiting this breakfast joint again.  Visit my other review at themealexperience.blogspot.com"}
{"text":"I didn't give 5 stars for two reasons.  When we asked for a table, the hostess said 30-45 minutes. That's fine. They also go our names AND OUR PHONE NUMBERS down. Which means that they'd text us once our table is available correct?   We ended up waiting for one hour, leaving us incredibly grumpy. We finally asked how long it will take, and they said they called us 20 minutes ago. We asked if they texted us and they said they did, however we did not receive a text. They blamed it on us and said, \"oh you probably got the phone number wrong.\" On top of that, the hostess was a COMPLETE and UTTER brat. I wish she had a name tag so I could include it in this review. She didn't welcome us, or even give us a genuine smile. She had RBF the whole time, which gave me a bad first impression. I am a hostess myself so I know that she did not even give the least amount of respect she should have given to guests. I receive better customer service at a McDonald's.   However, when we finally sat down, our server Weylie treated us amazing! Always had a smile on his face, and seemed like he genuinely wanted to be there taking care of us. The food came out fast and was obviously good, but the situation with the hostess still left us bitter.   And when we left, the hostess remained standing there and did not even say, \"thank you for coming\" or \"have a good rest of your day.\" Just stayed silent. Why is she even a hostess if she can't say hello or goodbye to guests? She is supposed to leave a good first and last impression, which she clearly failed to do so.   If you plan on eating here, don't be surprised if you wait for an hour because of their mistakes."}
{"text":"In a word: waffles make this five star. Yes a 45 minute drive and whatever wait time makes perfect sense to savor a light fluffy Gluten free waffle at Butters. Gilbert needs a Butters restaurant!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Always make a stop when in town... never disappoints. Wish I could convince you to open a location in Charlotte :)"}
{"text":"Came here today while looking for a breakfast spot in Scottsdale, AZ I recently just landed in this area. The intake process was pretty quick, the hostess let me know how long it would be, took my name and then I got a text. They told me to wait would be 20 to 30 minutes, and it was probably about 20. I was seated quickly, and greeted by my server immediately. The service was good, not necessarily great, it felt like she was rushing me a little bit. Due to the fact that they are so busy, I can appreciate this, but she brought me my check after two bites into my meal. As far as the food, I had the banana French toast and a side of bacon. The French toast was awesome, and it came out very fast, probably 5 minutes after I ordered. Overall, a good experience, and I would come back. It is not the best breakfast I've ever had, so I will keep looking for another spot in Scottsdale to become my go to. Overall good food, decent service, and okay ambience."}
{"text":"great pancakes and good coffee.. i love the fresh fruit with the pancakes."}
{"text":"Best breakfast ever! I'm not from the area, so we turned to Yelp to help us find a good breakfast spot. This was more than we could have hoped for! I had the fluffiest mouth-watering pancakes I've ever experienced along with some kind of scrambler. Everything was fresh tasty and service was decent. We had our two-year old along with us who enjoyed her mickey mouse pancake, too. Seating was a bit tight, but we all had a great dining experience. I would definitely come back on my next trip!"}
{"text":"Good food but not blown away. My French toast was delicious and I think the French toast and pancakes are what they are most famous for. My husband had the omelet and said it was very bland, unfortunately. Thus, we give this place 4 stars. No markdown for this, but the woman making espresso drinks at the front seemed like she hated her job. Poor customer interaction to someone who was very friendly and tipped her ahead of time. :/"}
{"text":"The wait is usually pretty long,  but well worth it. My favorite dish is the lox and cream cheese scrammbler. If you're in the.Scottsdale area, Butters is a must go place for breakfast or brunch"}
{"text":"Hands down one of my favorite breakfast places in town! My wife heard about this place and wanted to surprise me for Father's Day. She was so excited for it that we ended up going a week early. We were so impressed by the food we ended up going back three weeks in a row! For starters, the coffee and orange juice were both really good. I was skeptical of the famous banana cream pancakes just because it didn't sound good to me. Boy was I wrong. It was very taste and not too sweet. The wild berry pancakes were also very good and just a tad sweeter. The corned beef hash was so good as they actually use real corned beef. This was the second best corned beef I've ever had (1st is the hash from Richard Walker in San Diego). The eggs were also fluffy and plentiful (unlike the ones you get at an iHop or Village Inn).  The only down side is the wait time. Get there extra early on a weekend or expect to wait at least an hour. All in all I believe it's definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"This place is great for breakfast but you must arrive early, the wait can get to be too much and just not worth it especially on weekends. they are very kid friendly, our server was amazing (Andre) and he even brought our 1 year old a birthday crepe after we finished our meal, a true classy move! The only reason for the 4 stars is the wait of busy days. Other than that, its great! the veggie skillet is delicious."}
{"text":"This place is the best breakfast food around! Been coming here for years! Service is amazing !!! The tables are able to turn fast which makes waiting not to long! They have really improved the area. I live in the townhouses in the same complex and love this place. It seemed when I last went about a week or 2 ago that they changed the hash browns and they are less soft now. I feel like it's due to faster food output which it was faster but I'd rather wait for those perfect hash browns butters used to have."}
{"text":"Yes. Eat here. Fresh juice, hot skillets, and pancakes. Good shit right here."}
{"text":"Egg salmon nova with mushroom omlet with gluten free pancakes .2 cappuccinos playing with 2 pokestops and a gym. Good food good service."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast place in Scottsdale!  Every time we have visited (and its been a lot!), the food has been consistently good.    Please note, there is often a wait on the weekends for breakfast!  There is a coffee place in the same lot (Village Coffee), where you can go grab a drink to help pass the time while you enjoy the gorgeous Scottsdale weather.  It could be worse, people!  I almost always get the same thing - Eggs Rojo or Verde but get it Ying/Yang (half/half).  Its my favorite and I can't order anything else!  I always try to snag a bite of something sweet from one of my fellow diners.    The prices are fair - definitely not as expensive as many Scottsdale brunch menus.  Definitely give this a try - or don't to keep the lines shorter!"}
{"text":"Easily my favorite breakfast spot in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area.  Best pancakes I've ever had.  Fast and friendly service as well.  I'd go every day if I could."}
{"text":"I absolutely MUST give a SHOUT OUT to BUTTERS!  BACKGROUND  As many of you know, my real true love in life is PANCAKES.  I am always on the search for a good pancake house.   In fact, in my earliest days on Yelp, I specifically searched for good suggestions for pancakes which led me several establishments.  These establishments included: Butterfield's Pancake House, Iss' Magic Mixes, Original Breakfast House, Wildflower Bread Company, Crying Onion Café, Donna's Bakery Café, The Good Egg, Crêpe Bar, Crackers & Co Café, Morning Squeeze, Snooze An AM Eatery, Market Café, True Food Kitchen, and T.C. Eggington's.  But let's talk about BUTTER'S PANCAKES & CAFÉ!!  BUTTER'S PANCAKES & CAFÉ  Butter's Pancakes & Café has two Scottsdale locations.  Butter's strives to set high goals and achieve them, to be the best breakfast and lunch cafe in Arizona, and the world.   With over 40 years of restaurant experience and numerous successful prior concepts, they know that it takes fresh, innovative food served consistently with unsurpassed quality by dedicated team members in a clean and warm environment.   Additionally, they approach the dining experience as an idea, a way of living and a way of eating, which results in a better experience for their guests.  THE STORY & SERVICE EXPERIENCE  I first tried Butter's in 2016, whilst looking for new places for pancakes, and have been several times since.   Every time I've been, the line is out the door, with an approximate 20-40 minute wait.  The restaurant isn't fancy, but it is cute and clean. The staff is personable and efficient. The crowd ranges from 20's to retirees, so everyone fits in.  Everything I've tried was DELICIOUS. I especially LOVE the BERRIES CRÊPE PANCAKES!! Absolutely TO DIE FOR YUMMY!!  The staff is usually young, hip, and quick. My experience with the staff is that they are personable, but more to the point of bringing your meal fast and efficiently, so don't expect to be coddled, just expect to eat a great breakfast.  The environment is always busy and bustling, kind of like a New York deli, so don't expect a quiet romantic brunch.  CONCLUSION  I tolerate the long waiting because I LOVE the pancakes here so much. And so will you!  I will definitely keep coming back!  4/5 RECOMMEND  OF NOTE  *Plenty of parking out front.  *Reservations NOT accepted. Be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"A plus coffee!  I am serious, it tastes a bit like Gevalia.  After a week of hotel coffee, this is heaven.  Everything is real.  Real cream, real butter.  Great selection of hot sauces, and no hoity toity lack of salt (tho that spice turned out to be unnecessary)  Staff is no nonsense, you don't feel that circus atmosphere (no one asked if I have been here before, as if their place of business is a destination). These guys are primed for volume.  I arrived at 6:30 on a Saturday. I was out 45 minutes later.  In that time, their wait staff tripled.  Pancakes... Maybe 7 / 10.  Tend to get mushy with syrup but very good.  But I tend to be hard on flapjacks.  Because Bisquick.  Extra points for having chorizo, corned beef hash, and being able to effectively subtract onions from my order.  Really no trace, that is remarkable. I know, onions are in a lot of breakfast foods and sauces.  I do not mind them cooked!  When you want a really good no nonsense beakfast, come on out to Butters!  Mike"}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday and there was no wait. The reviews, and menu on the website all looked promising.  My hubby did not like their coffee at all. Tasted like the burnt Starbucks coffee.  He ordered the Fish and Chips. Homemade tartar sauce was a little on the sweet side, fish was ok and the french fries were not seasoned. We have had better.  I ordered the Prime Rib French Dip with a side of fruit. The bread was ok, the prime rib has a pretty good flavor. The dip was bland, almost like broth out of can. Side of fruit was really small.  I think they did a great job hiring someone to write up their menu and design the interior. But the food could use some fine tuning. For the price, I was expecting a little more flavor overall.  Probably will not go back again."}
{"text":"Super tasty! I would highly recommend this spot for breakfast. I got the Strawberry Belgium Waffle and my sister got a feta, bacon omelette - we ended up switching, both were really good."}
{"text":"Met a friend here for brunch absolutely fantastic! The wait was a little bit but it is worth the wait the food is totally delicious. Service was friendly and you never had to ask them for a refill. Little bit busy a little bit noisy but very good food..."}
{"text":"Whole Hog - good. Orange juice - good. Pancakes - good.  Thick slabs of bacon  - yum!!"}
{"text":"My new favorite breakfast place. Amazing food, fantastic service, perfect lattes, the only bad part is how far away I live from this place. Butters please open a location in Pasadena!"}
{"text":"This was my husband and my first visit to Butters Pancakes & Cafe in Scottsdale. As we approached the restaurant in our car, we noticed the line of hungry folks waiting for a table to become available.  My husband gave them our name and it was entered into an iPad they use to keep track of people waiting to be seated. The hostess logged my husband in on the iPad and sent him a link on Yelp; from there my husband could monitor our progress in line. It showed where we were in line and how many people were ahead of us--I think this is a neat and efficient way to use technology.  When it was our turn he saw it on Yelp and received a phone with a message. We were greeted by a friendly hostess whom led us to a booth. Once seated, we perused the menu of a wide variety of breakfast and lunch dishes.  I chose the vegetable egg skillet with wheat toast and my husband chose the corn beef hash and pancakes. We drank coffee and they bring out real cream for the coffee; there is ice cold water in a glass pitcher as well. They sell their signature coffee and pancake syrup at the front; they also have a coffee bar.  We didn't wait too long before our delicious food was brought to our table by our friendly waitress. Wow!! All I can say is wow! Our food was delicious! I had my eggs scrambled on my vegetable skillet with hash browns. My eggs were light and fluffy, the vegetables fresh and prepared just right. My husband's hash was crispy and his fried eggs perfect. His pancakes came with butter and powdered sugar on the side. Our breakfast was yummy! This location is very busy and nearby they are building a new and much larger restaurant they will move into within the next few months. We will definitely be back in the near future to try more of their delicious breakfast."}
{"text":"We were visiting from Las Vegas for Christmas weekend. We found this place on Yelp and decided to try it based on the reviews. This restaurant is a great spot for breakfast. Excellent food, awesome service and great drinks.  We will be back whenever we visit AZ."}
{"text":"I had a very positive dining experience. The service was very good and the food was delicious. It was very packed and we had to wait but it was well worth it in the end. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area! Quick and fresh. Best strawberry pancakes in the world"}
{"text":"I owe them a review as we eat there often.  The bad is that there is always a wait.  Yesterday was about 40 minutes.  The good is the great breakfast food and service,  They have a wide variety but main staples are omelettes, skillets, pancakes, and waffles.  With many varieties of each.  Yesterday's service was not fantastic and that was unusual.  I love to go there on nice days and eat on the patio."}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place. The fresh squeezed orange juice is the best I've ever had, and those cinnamon roll pancakes are simply heaven. There is always a wait (which is a great sign) but it is absolutely worth it!"}
{"text":"Came in for a late breakfast today. Decided to go with a bagel sandwich and a side of hash browns. They serve their hasbrowns like scalloped potatoes, it was good just unexpected. The bagel sandwich was pretty average but the side of pancakes I ordered were insanely good. I am not one for sweet breakfast foods but these pancakes were almost too good. I will definitely plan my breakfast around getting pancakes next time."}
{"text":"Have eaten at Butterfields and found out this is owned by the same people. No doubt the equation works. Fresh squeezed OJ was incredible as was the coffee and banana French toast. My husband also enjoyed his eggs Benedict with fresh fruits on the side. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in AZ ! Always hot and comes out fresh! Keep up the great work ! Thank you for the great service !!!"}
{"text":"I love breakfast and this is now on my top 10 list. I had the protein pancakes - delicious! We'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"Not from this area so I used Yelp to find a yummy breakfast spot, well, when you walk in and it's crowded, you know the food is gonna be good, and hell yes it was! I get this place is known for the pancakes but I needed something more, the Mexican omelette was just what I needed, full of flavor and it was so good I can't wait to go back again"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite breakfast places of all time.   The strawberry cheesecake french toast is my favorite along with the berry pancakes or french toast both are good.  I tried the corned beef hash skillet and it was okay.    The waiter is hit or miss on service sometimes but the food makes up for it. I just don't like when people try to force me to take food that I did not ask for.  Its like i specifically asked for something why would I want something else???  Oh well. I love their food."}
{"text":"Bottom line - Best pancakes I've ever had! I went with the wild berry and had an out of body experience. I don't even know where I am. Usually, with most pancakes, I have to douse them with syrup and spread butter all over. These were so perfectly golden brown and had all sorts of sauces coming out on top and everywhere in-between. They were heavenly! And the service was speedy and exceptional!"}
{"text":"We were out walking this morning and decided to have some breakfast, and butters was pretty close. I always saw that the parking lot was packed, and now I know why! The food was so good, it was perfectly prepared, and super filling because the portions are big. We even had some leftovers! My coffee was always being refilled, and the servers checked on us a lot. I haven't had very good service in a long time, but this place has awesome service and restored my hope in customer experience!! Thank you for a great breakfast :) highly recommended"}
{"text":"A whole lot of breakfast and its good!  In town on business and Yelp once again guided my choice for a great meal.  Butters serves up breakfast till 2pm.  Its location is a suburban Scottsdale shopping center. As you walk in you pass there fresh orange juice machine, you know the OJ has to be good and it was!  We were seated outside on this hot 95 degree Scottsdale morning (in April, wow) and the cool misters were blowing to keep the heat down.    The menu is quite large and I went with an interesting dish in their skillet section called Corned Beef Has Skillet.  Now, this is not your basic skillet dish.  This is a huge meal consisting of a base of has browns (well done for me) with delicious corned beef hash on top of it, then melted cheese (I think cheddar) and topped off with two eggs (poached just right for me).  Oh, did I mention on top of all of this, you get a side of pancakes or toast.  A whole lot of delicious food in that large skillet.  needless to say, I needed a good nap afterward!  We also tried the Cajun chicken sausage which was very good.  We did venture back the next day and I had a basic egg white omelet with spinach and feta.  Was not as impressed day 2 however I'm still thinking about that amazing skillet the day before so its 4 stars for Butters!"}
{"text":"Hands down, one of the best breakfast spots in all of Phoenix/Scottsdale! Always packed so make reservations just in case! Their denver omelette is to crave for."}
{"text":"The place is so good! This is the best breakfast I've ever had. There was a 45 minute wait, but there's a reason for that. Our waitress Eva was wonderful & suggested the Wildberry pancakes. They were delicious!"}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast and fast service which is a A plus. I would come back every Sunday if I can. I had the French toast with bacon and a glass of fresh orange juice. Sat outside, which was no wait but if you ask to sit inside it's a while wait. But the food is worth it!"}
{"text":"Love the protein pancakes! The food is delicious as is the coffee. Great patio to enjoy a beautiful morning. My kids love it too!"}
{"text":"Great food at great prices.! We were very pleased- Regina remembered everything! My kids split the two eggs, sausage & chocolate chip pancakes! Superb! I had sweet delicious cinnamon apple crepes and hubby had hog scramble. Everyone enjoyed everything!"}
{"text":"The good  1. Quick service at your table 2. Nice selection of items on the menu 3. Tasty food  The bad  1. A bit expensive  2. You will have at least a 45 minute wait to get a table 3. If you are over 5 ft 9 or weight more than 160 lbs, ask for a table because those booths are narrow and only made for petite people and kids."}
{"text":"First time here, I have to say the breakfast was very good. I had the whole hog skillet it was wonderfull, the wheat toast was great, but the wild berry pancakes were amazing, I highly recommend."}
{"text":"The Butter's location on Northsight is just as great as the other locations on Shea and Via de Ventura. The food is excellent, the service is top notch, the menu selection is great. It's everything you could want for breakfast or lunch.  The best thing about Butter's and Butterfield's is the option get pancakes instead of toast with breakfast. That was the thing I missed most about moving to Phoenix. The pancake option was available at almost every restaurant in Chicago, but not so here.   Butter's and Butterfield's is my go-to spot for breakfast and I believe the best in the valley. You can't go wrong here. Just go early, because the wait times can be very long if you go during the rush.  Try one of their skillets, of course with pancakes. That's my favorite!"}
{"text":"Blueberry pancakes.  That's all you really need to know.  Get them on the side for breakfast and you will be happy for the rest of the day.  The food speaks for itself here.  It's simple and fresh and is served with kindness.  They have a large patio for the few great weather months in AZ.  You will most likely have to wait at least 15 minutes for a table no matter when you arrive,  but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Super busy place! Fresh squeezed orange juice is amazing. I had the granola yogurt bowl and was HUGE! All the fresh fruit!! Service was good. Nothing spectacular. Great place to just grab a bite!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Sunday morning and waited about 15 mins. It was a nice sunny day outside and they have both indoor and outdoor seating. We chose first available so ended up eating inside. The booth we were given was comfy and spacious. Service is really good here and water is already on the table. We ordered the Popeyes white egg scramble and the New Mexico skillet. Both were tasty and the food came alarmingly fast. Great value and no fuss that's what brunch should be!"}
{"text":"Best pancake in the land and the skillets are a slam dunk. This place is the fantastic. And the service is quick and fast. Would eat here any day of the week."}
{"text":"My staff loves this place. They have a great selection of breakfast foods as well as lunch. The portions are perfect and quite tasty. If you are in the area you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Our favorite place! My hubby and I are regulars. Try the Wildberry Bliss pancakes, you won't be disappointed. It's usually very busy, but it's worth it. They are very fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great wait staff! This place was recommended to my wife and I and it lived up to the hype. I had the eggs Benedict and my wife had the waffles. We both thought it was delicious. Oh, and the hot chocolate was fantastic too! :)"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast on a Sunday a few weeks back and I'm sure we will take the drive up again in the future. We got there around 8am and there was already about a 40 minute wait but it went by fast. The weather was cool and we enjoyed sitting outside. My daughter ate all of her strawberry crepes, her friend devoured her pancakes and I enjoyed a skillet that came with pancakes but I was so full I had to bring the pancakes home. The pancakes were good reheated but next time I think I'll skip the skillet and just enjoy the pancakes or waffles. Gave 3 stars since the place is too small for the amount of tables, so you are stuck squeezing in between people that are trying to eat. Also give 3 stars because the food is quite pricey for traditional breakfast foods that you can get almost anywhere that serves breakfast."}
{"text":"I attend here almost every weekend. The service is great, the food is delicious, and it's an enjoyable atmosphere.   It's great for families and out of towners.   They don't take reservations but it is worth the wait. You can grab a coffee from butters of the roastery a few stores down.   They have great eggs, skillets, waffles, and pancakes!"}
{"text":"Waited about 10 minutes on a Friday morning (!?!) and it was worth it! The service is quick, not rushed and pleasant! The portions are very ample! My hubby always gets omelets out and he raved about the \"fluffiness\"! I had the scramble which was cooked perfectly and delish! We both got pancake \"sides\"...yum! And they even offered us coffee or water to go...an added bonus!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast!  Visited on a Tuesday morning and there was a slight wait, once my friend and I tried the food and experienced their great service we could see why.  Did not disappoint, will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Friendly service with an incredible attention to detail. Food always comes out fast, hot and delicious like their other locations. Butters is THE breakfast spot of Arizona."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast spots in Scottsdale! We went for breakfast on Saturday at about 10:30 AM and the place was packed! It took us about 40 minutes to get a table but the food was worth it! I ordered eggs Verde and it was wonderful. They have great coffee and good atmosphere. My wife ordered the hot chocolate with her meal and said it was one of the best she's ever had. We will definitely be returning to this place."}
{"text":"My wife and I very much enjoyed our breakfast at Butters.  We were in the area on our anniversary and wanted something with a lot of options as we have completely different palettes.  This was perfect.  I loved my corned beef skillet and oreo pancake side.  We will be back again."}
{"text":"We really like this place.  A great option is ordering a pancake plate one of the skillets and splitting the two so you get the best of both worlds - sweet and savory!  We usually do the chocolate chip pancakes and the corn beef hash skillet (so good) and split them.  If you order only one of these options, go for the hash.  The coffee bar has a great mocha that isn't too be missed out on, if you are into coffee.    You may have to wait for a few minutes if it is a weekend morning (especially church crowd eating time on Sunday), but it's worth a wait.  Service is usually quick and friendly.    Overall: A Mmmmmm."}
{"text":"Service was decent.  Place was fairly busy for a weekday, late morning.  Food was well below standard for the price point.  Eggs were not edible in the slightest.  Pancakes and hashbrowns were hit and miss per person from temperature served at the table and texture.  Not a fan.  Disappointed after so many good reviews, but we were just driving through so no need to repeat."}
{"text":"Ridiculously packed on the weekend. We came around 10:30am and were informed the wait was 45 minutes. Stick around, because often others are intimidated by the long wait and leave. Because of that our wait was only 25 min.  Butters serves your typical breakfast diner food. Menu is moderately extensive, prices are cheap.  Protein Power Pancakes (Wheat pancakes, blueberries, oats & almonds) - These pancakes tasted very healthy. They were full of blueberries, but I could not taste any almonds. I loved the texture from the oatmeal streusel sprinkled on top. Despite being wheat, the pancakes were pretty fluffy. I liked how they were smaller and decently sized instead of oversized pancakes as big as a large dinner plate that most diners in NJ seem to like serving.   Wildberry Bliss Pancakes (Stuffed with blueberries, layered with vanilla mascarpone, topped with vanilla cream, fresh wildberries & glaze) - I did not have this, but my dad and sister enjoyed it. Apparently, these pancakes were more fluffy with all that cream. The tastiest part was the top pancake with the vanilla cream on top.   Veggie Egg White Omelette - Large for sure, but it needed more of the vegetables it said it had. The omelette was disappointing.  Corned Beef Hash - I probably enjoyed this more than the pancakes. Really good to cut through the sweetness of the pancakes  Hash Browns - Crispy potatoes, can't go wrong.  Since this is your typical diner breakfast food, 25 min. wait is worth it. Any more than that, it probably wouldn't be worth it the second time. Go for the pancakes and corned beef hash, skip the omelettes."}
{"text":"Went to Butters with my boyfriend this past weekend after a morning hike and honestly we were both quite disappointed with our meals. After reading all the fantastic Yelp reviews I expected a much better breakfast than I received.   Not saying what I ate wasn't good but it certainly wasn't anything extraordinary. I ordered the egg breakfast with the Oreo smores pancakes and my boyfriend had the same but with chocolate chip pancakes.  We both didn't like the hash browns it reminded us of baked potatoes and we're not impressed with out pancakes. One thing that was nice was the service, Yelp does not lie about quick service and nice waiters.  Overall the place is okay but considering how far away it is from where I live I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Some of the best breakfast food I have ever had!! So happy that I stumbled upon this gem and was able to get some bomb brioche French toast and the skillet. The customer service was excellent as well. When I come back to Scottsdale, I can't wait to try it again!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! Came here for brunch and ordered omelets, pancakes, and skillet eggs. Everything turned out amazing and the service was great! Highly recommend this spot when In Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I headed over after staying in Scottsdale for a holiday party the night before - I was exhausted and I practically looked like I rolled out of bed so not a pretty sight.  I was starving and I found this place on yelp.  I was so excited to try a new place out because I don't try new places very much.  As we park and start walking to the restaurant, we see a big window looking into the restaurant and two or three young ladies scrutnizing me and my bf as if they are talking about us.  I wanted to say, \"Yes, I know.  I'm short, he's tall and I look like $hit!\" Well, at least I think that's what they are saying on the other side of the wall.  When we walk in, they seat us right away.  The restaurant was not busy at all so that was nice.  I ordered the corn beef hash skillet with pancakes and a side of bacon.  The corn beef hash was delightful - it had the perfect crunch and lot sof cheese. mmmm cheese!  Pancakes were light and fluffy, but the applewood bacon was not good. At all. I advise to not order it.  I eat bacon all the time.  If I can eat bacon everyday and not feel guilty about it, I would.  I like em crunchy, hot and full of goodness.  Their bacon was chewy, cool, and it didn't taste like bacon. It just tasted like fried oil.  I told the waitress I was not feeling the bacon and it was such an awkward moment for me. She asked me what I wanted to do and I asked her if I can just get a fresh plate.  She took the plate and came back with a fresh plate and that too tasted like the last. I then just proceeded to eat my corn beef hash to get rid of that taste in my mouth.    The bill came and the waitress was kind enough to take the bacon off the bill. For two people, the check came to approximately $25 with tip. Totally a \"go-to\" spot if you are in Scottsdale. Just don't get the bacon."}
{"text":"I have been going here with my fiancé and we absolutely love it.  The food is fantastic.  Last week my whole family and I went there for Easter brunch and we had a really bad time, (we didn't mind the 40 mins wait, after all it was Easter)our waitress  was VERY rude. After all we went through we decided to give her a tip over the 10%,because the food is honestly really good, and when I turned around to say thank you she didn't even look at me and poured all the syrup on my head.   We told the manager and we really hope they do something about it."}
{"text":"Absolutely Devine!  Eggs cooked to perfection  Omelettes fluffy with fresh ingredients  Pancakes golden brown and not over filling Fruit served at the best freshness  Bacon crispy, sausage flavorful, and ham mathematically squared Coffee roasted on point and brewed correctly  And A++ service! Friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable staff. Decor and environment inviting and comfortable with a flair for art  Best Breakfast Restaurant in America!"}
{"text":"Don't often review, but after dining here felt compelled to write! Pancakes are excellent! They are cooked perfectly, and light enough that they do not leave you with the felling of having swallowed a man hole cover. Bacon is cooked to perfection, flavorful, and not the least bit greasy. The coffee is delicious, as is the freshly squeezed orange juice. Service is attentive and unobtrusive. A must-try for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! One of the reasons is they have gluten free pancakes and waffles!  The hash browns are some of the best I've had and the bacon is a thick cut and full of flavor. The EGGS ROJO OR VERDE and BACON, MUSHROOM & ONION SKILLET are some of my favorites. Overall the food has tasted amazing every time I have been here and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"The toppings for their pancakes were not my favorites, but that may be personal taste. Very reasonable price for a wonderful portions of food and fresh flavors, especially in the omelettes."}
{"text":"One of our goto places for Breakfast.  Quick friendly service, good food, nice patio. Can't say anything bad about this place. Have been several times and will continue to go back. Recommend it highly."}
{"text":"I have experienced a much better breakfast elsewhere. I must mention if you have a major sweet tooth then this spot will be your all time favorite. However, I was lured in by all the pictures and because everything looks so sweet and delicious. Yet, after I took one bite of the smored Oreo pancakes I knew I was done. I could not tolerate how sweet they were. My hash browns weren't very good and the fried bagel sandwich was not anything special either."}
{"text":"I'm giving this restaurant 3 stars for a couple of reasons. 1. Seating is confined. 2. Too noisy. 3. They have high prices and they will not substitute. Example. We ordered a Denver Omlet. We asked them to hold the onions and replace with jalapeños. For that we had to pay an additional charge. But they did not refund for no onions. If your looking for an intimate breakfast for two, this is not the place. The crowd on Sunday morning is like 75% children under the age of 3. Saturday is a little better, but I would sit outside. Overall the food is good. The restaurant seating is just very tight fitting. And if you like fresh squeezed orange juice, it's ok, a little sour and a large glass is $5.28."}
{"text":"This place is a must taste. The OJ is freshly squeezed and the banana cream pancakes are to die for. One of the best breakfast stops in the USA."}
{"text":"Best orange juice around. Reason enough. However, the food is fresh, eggs are great and not your typical grease job, and the service is always friendly.  A bit on the pricey side, so it's more a monthly place than a weekly place.  Still, a great shout for a great morning."}
{"text":"Always worth the wait! Cheesy grits never fail to amaze and they are always happy to accommodate any request!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for brunch before catching our flight back home. Extremely glad we did! Service was top-notch. Thanks, Victoria! She repeated each of our orders to make sure everything was correct. I ordered a custom omelette. It was the best omelette I've ever had, and I have had many. Extremely light and fluffy. Loved the thinly cut hash browns. And the fresh squeezed OJ was so good, I ordered a second. One of my kids ordered the short stack of pancakes and said that they were the best he's ever had. If we are ever in the area again, we are definitely eating at Butters."}
{"text":"Facts are, it's pretty hard to screw up breakfast. This place sets it on a tee and knocks it out of the park! The food is amazing and the pricing is more than fair. Our table had cinnamon roll pancakes, a skillet, and oreo pancakes, all plates were emptied promptly after arrival. We didn't try one, but I have never seen omelettes that big! Not sure if Danny was the owner or manager but I loved the casual conversation we shared. Only issue was that it is loud inside but that's what happens with a full house. This is a must try if you are in the Scottsdale area. 3 breakfast entrees and 2 sodas, $34."}
{"text":"Brunch with my friend today. Not surprised during the busy Sunday brunch rush, but it was a solid hour wait.   The menu is typical. I ordered the protein power cakes (wheat, almonds, blueberries), and my friend ordered an egg white omlet.  The food came out fast. Nothing spectacular but good. But not worth waiting an hour for.  Also, our server, while very nice and prompt, was very thrown by a simple request my friend made. She wanted a cranberry juice with sprite mixed. The server said, I'm not sure if we can do that. I'm not sure to charge it as juice or soda. Do you want half and half, or more soda with splash of cranberry or more cranberry with splash of soda.... Huh? It should not have been that complicated, so we bristled about that a little.  Cute place. Solid brunch. I'm not opposed to coming back but I wouldn't go out of my way."}
{"text":"Really good food, a little pricey and a pretty long wait (but it was Sunday morning).  I like that they serve heavy cream with their coffee, and the coffee was pretty tasty.  My wife said the grits were good, and they cooked their bacon perfectly!  They also had this phone/text waiting list that showed you how many people were ahead of you, which was nice cause the wait was 1/2 hour...  All in all, pretty good spot for breakfast."}
{"text":"My dad and I stayed in Scottsdale for 4 nights - we went to Butters for breakfast the first morning, and it was so great we went back the next 3 mornings! A huge menu and everything we got was great. The fresh OJ is amazing. The omelets are huge and perfectly cooked. Great pancakes, waffles, the works. Everything you could ask for in a breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"Our server, Monica, she was incredibly nice. The food was amazing, this is going to be my go to breakfast brunch location from now on. The atmosphere was very welcoming. The manager Rafael was very helpful during our experience. This was my first time at butters and I'm amazed."}
{"text":"Giving this restaurant five stars is easy.  The service was good, the food was great, and even with a crowd we didn't have to wait very long.  Our server was very friendly, explained the menu well, and was very attentive, as was the owner, who was very nice.  The food was delicious and I don't think I have had fluffier scrambled eggs ever.   It's easy to see why there is a line out the door even on a weekday morning.  Would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Solid place forFood, especially the pancakes and waffles and French toast. If you haven't been to this place before it should be on your must go to list. If you are new in town also tried as well. Try not to sit outside on a windy day, parking in the parking lot sucks hard-core."}
{"text":"I have come here twice now and never have I been to a breakfast house that got the orders out quicker! Both times it had to be less than 5 mins and we had our food! So cool. The food is really good, restaurant decor is nice, and they have a full coffee bar located inside so you can order premium drinks. I like it!! :)"}
{"text":"The food here is AMAZING.... wow. Got the scramble with smoked salmon and cream cheese, wild berries pancakes, and banana French toast. I'm in love with the vanilla cream they put between the pancakes!!! Everything was delicious. Multiple people came by to check on us so the service is definitely pristine. No complaints at all!!!"}
{"text":"Everything was excellent.  Coffee had a nice kick to it, chicken scramble was delicious.  Portions are large so it is worth the extra $."}
{"text":"While staying up in scottsdale I yelped a place for breakfast and Butters came up.  I was so glad we came to eat here.  I had ordered the corn beef hash and eggs, it really filled me up good!  The coffee was great and the service was AWESOME!"}
{"text":"Okay... YUM! Completely worth the wait! The food (I had a New Mexican scramble with a chocolate chip pancake and fresh squeezed OJ) is absolutely amazing and the staff is extremely friendly and quick. They have indoor seating along with a great patio area. My husband and I cleaned our plates and will definitely be back for another breakfast in the future."}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time several weeks ago and fell in love with their Wild Berry Bliss pancakes. They are \"out of this world delicious\"! And the large portion of red raspberries, strawberry's, and blueberry's they serve with the pancakes is equally yummy - ripe - no shortcuts here.   The service both times I have been here has been no-frills and quick, just like I like it.   Went on vacation to Florida last week and couldn't stop bragging to my girlfriend how delicious this places was. So excited to be back and have breakfast here again."}
{"text":"Had a good breakfast here today, including The Whole Hog Skillet ( amazing), Strawberry Cheesecake French Toast( slightly artificial berry taste, but jam was superb) Wild Berry Bliss French Toast ( could have used a little more drizzle), lox and bagel ( perfectly toasted bagel!), granola parfait ( really really good). The fresh squeezed orange juice is a must try with your meal, and finally- please try the Smoreo pancake. We could not believe the amazing mess that was so yummy!! Our small complaint was that the noise level was pretty loud, and you could not hear across the table."}
{"text":"Wanted to try something for brunch and gave this spot a shot. Súper yummy!! The mexicana omlette was delicious!"}
{"text":"The BEST BREAKFAST restaurant in Phoenix. The pancakes and the grits are second to none. When people ask where they should go to breakfast this is the first place I tell them.  The service is always pretty good and I've never had to wait longer than 10 minutes to be seated."}
{"text":"My mouth and my soul say YES!!! Omg that was some yummy, amazing, delightful yumminess. The wild berry pancakes were the best I've ever had. It needs nothing extra! They are so light and fluffy, and the berries were incredibly fresh and perfect, long with the cream they use. I want to lick the plate. My skillet with the mushroom, bacon and onions was so good. The eggs were the fluffiest eggs I've ever had. The 30 minute wait was worth it. This is an absolute must for breakfast. The food comes out fast and it will wow you. My husband had the Oreo pancakes. It was very good but a little too sweet to eat all of them. The wild berry was the perfect sweetness. But a kids will delight in the Oreo pancakes. Absolutely come here. Service was very good."}
{"text":"Outstanding!!   Even on a Busy Weekend (SAT) from the time i hit the front door to the time I left the staff made me feel welcome. Wait time 10-15 minutes tops & well worth the wait.  Servers were attentive and I had an Awesome Denver Omelet.  Definitely want to go back next time i'm in town."}
{"text":"I've found Butters to have one of the best GF pancakes in Scottsdale, based on taste and texture.  We love coming here and have always been treated respectfully by the staff. Service is fast.   Recently we went vegan as well as GF which has been tough, but this place again being so great could accommodate us with the Veggie Skillet subbing black beans for eggs. All in all it was hash brown potatoes, onions, green peppers, spinach, and black beans. I added avocado. Thanks for being so flexible!   Maybe this could be the start of a small vegan menu section here at Butters?"}
{"text":"This place is LIT! Wow. Best breakfast. Worth the wait. You get so much food for your money too. Service isn't phenomenal but that's okay. The grits were out of this world good. I got eggs sausage grits and 2 pancakes for roughly $8. The pancakes were melt in your mouth good. The only downfall is the wait but it's worth it. I'll definitely be back. They had so many menu options that looked good I couldn't decide. Lots of sweet signature pancake options and crepes and brunch and lunch items. Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"On vacation from Berkeley, CA, and found Butters on Yelp. We were definitely not disappointed! I ordered the Country \"Benny\" and it was a biscuit with a huge sausage patty on each side, a perfectly poached egg on each patty, and the whole thing was covered in country gravy!! I was wondering where the hollandaise sauce was since it was a benedict, but I was perfectly happy with the gravy. I also had the grits (came with it), and they were the fluffiest grits I've ever had.   One of my friends ordered the baked potato eggs and the other the belgian waffle. They both were very happy with their choices, as was I. The food was delicious, the service was spot-on friendly, and we decided to go back before I went back to California. This time two of us had the pancakes, and they were perfectly sized, light and fluffy, and absolutely delicious!!!  The highlight of this trip was seeing the Grand Canyon for the first time, and then enjoying a wonderful breakfast with my friends!"}
{"text":"This place is the best breakfast place in Scottsdale! The menu is very diverse with anything you'd want for breakfast or lunch including a variety of healthy options. The wait staff are very professional and courteous and the service that i experienced from Willy and Basma was superb! They both really made my dining experience enjoyable!! With 12 years in the restaurant industry under my belt, I will continue to frequent this establishment again and again because good restaurants have good food AND good service!"}
{"text":"Food was awesome! Service was great! Music was   Food came put VERY fast. It was our first time here but I promise you it won't be our last! We gotta bring the kids back, they will love it!"}
{"text":"A bustling breakfast spot located in an upscale shopping area serving a host of breakfast classics from pancakes and eggs to waffles and benedicts.  We arrive around 8:30 on a Sunday and they were already on a wait (check in inside and get a buzzer). Even though there were 10 or so ahead of us the wait was only about 5 minutes. Since it is a breakfast place the tables turn pretty quickly.  We started out with orange juice -fresh squeezed yum! And each ordered some pancakes. I got pecan and my wife pecan with added blueberries. The standard order of 4 would have been enough for both of us to share.  The food was served quickly and we were in and out in about 40 minutes including our short wait. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"I love brunch. Like, a lot. Butters is totally worth the wait (~20-30 min) and has an amazingly long menu where every item looks delicious. I got two eggs, sausage links, cheese grits, and specialty pancakes (something with berries and marscapone and butter). This all came together and didn't seem like a lot when ordering but turned out to be WAY too much. Enough for me to take home and eat for breakfast the next day. I also got the fresh squeezed grapefruit juice and it complimented my meal well. The waitress and hostesses were all really nice and the location was easy to find too. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"AMAZING pancakes. Fast & quality service and the food is great. Be prepared for a wait to get in, but it's soooooooo worth it. The fresh squeezed juices are great too. Looking forward to my next trip here... Which might be tomorrow lol."}
{"text":"I had my first visit at Butters Pancakes & Cafe today and I found myself another favorite place! First off, I love the location. The east side of the restaurant has a patio area that's exposed to the rising sun, which makes it a particularly great place to have breakfast. There's even a fountain to add to the welcoming feel of the environment. Today was a particularly great day to eat breakfast outside due to the cool weather and the effects of rain coming or going or in between. Where the patio area is situated truly takes advantage of the great weather we have hear in the Valley.  The food was great! I savored my Irish Benny. The coffee was awesome! I already had a coffee on my way to Butters, but on this particular day and this particular weekend in general, I needed some extra caffeine help. I asked for cream for my coffee and our waitress provided a little individual pour cup with cream, but I had a chance take a couple of sips before the cream was laid on the table and I found the coffee is great on it's own and is best on it's own.   I first thought of Butters by driving by it a couple of times. When I looked it up on my Yelp app, I found that I had already bookmarked it is having potential in my near future. So glad to find new places to love and will definitely visit again.  Here's my tip: When I left around 8 AM, there were people waiting outside. I wasn't thinking about the Sunday morning crowd so I was just lucky to have come in early. Be ready to wait if you're determined to have breakfast here Sunday in the AM."}
{"text":"First time is here and it's ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! Food is great and very tasty! Staff are very nice and friendly. Service was excellent! Favorite is fresh squeezed grapefruit and orange juice"}
{"text":"Ordered takeout cause didn't have time for 30 min wait. Got the Banana Cream Pancakes. The pancakes themselves were warm, soft(melted in my mouth) and super tasty. The banana cream was ok, definitely gonna try the Oreo cakes next visit."}
{"text":"This restaurant is pretty good although I will say I judge breakfast restaurants by their bacon. That's why only three stars their bacon is only two stars"}
{"text":"Wow. My husband and i both had eggs with bacon. He got the california and i got scrambled. Came with pancakes and hashbrowns. Literally- my husband never compliments food and he was very impressed. Fresh squeezed juices- oh my! Definitely tasty."}
{"text":"Really yummy breakfast! We got there and there was a line out the door, they estimated 20-25 minute wait which I was surprised at that short. They ended up calling me about 6 minutes later with a table ready! We ordered our food and it appeared about 2.5 minutes later. So fast! And great service."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast/brunch spot ever!!!! Every time my bf and I get a chance to grab a bite to eat, I ALWAYS want to come here! The food is all so delicious ~ I've loved everything I've tried! And believe me, I'd be clear if I didn't:) My fav is the New Mexico Skillet. Pretty sure I've ordered it at least 4 times! The service is great too, even when super busy. YUM"}
{"text":"A breakfast place with more normal people than the trendy and hipsters that I can't stand.    Chorizo and eggs were fantastic! Corned beef hash homemade and not out of a can! Great biscuits and gravy.    Great breakfast food all together.    Maybe add some crem brûlée French toast to the menu and it would be damn close to perfection"}
{"text":"Was really good. Food and service. Worth the wait. Waiter. Willie great. Great experience"}
{"text":"Extremely fast service with excellent food. Fluffy omelettes and buttery/flaky hash browns. I substituted my pancakes for fruit but slightly regret the decision since I'm sure they would have been delightful! There was only a 5 minute wait (it's Friday morning), which gave me time to pick out my did from the extensive menu. I'm in heaven!"}
{"text":"Yum pancakes are delish -with the warm syrup! The service was a lil on the slow side and our waitress might of been have not an off day. But the entire menu has something for everyone!"}
{"text":"our first breakfast out in Scottsdale and this place didn't disappoint. had to wait like 15 minutes but that's expected at delicious places. loved my irish benny! good chocolate milk also. loved the nice waiting area with fountain. and grits! love my cheese grits :)"}
{"text":"Food and service was great! Big portions sizes also!  The waitresses didn't look that happy or smile but happy with the amount of food we got for the price"}
{"text":"Fantastic place. Great service wonderful food. Maybe some of the best pancakes I have ever had."}
{"text":"Basically a local IHOP. Had the California scramble with chocolate chip pancakes and Irish eggs benedict.  Pancakes were light and fluffy. Hash browns were more like scalloped potatoes and not very good. Took 40 minutes to get in the door for a table of two but food came out like 5 minutes after ordering. Plates were huge."}
{"text":"Great delicious tasty breakfast and fabulous friendly service. Crowded loud and a tight dining room but if you're in the area the food is wonderful. Hostess needs to smile and be a bit more welcoming-too Frankenstienish if you ask me.   The hubby got the Irish Eggs Benedict with a side of cheesy grits, the twist on this dish was serving it up with corned beef hash instead of ham and if you're feeling nostalgic for the South you have a choice of sides and thankfully grits are on the menu.  Awesome presentation and very tasty.  I chose an eggless chorizo burrito-oh, my..every bite was sinfully delicious.  My only complaint is that the chorizo needs to drained of the greasy fat before serving. Our server was very upbeat friendly and hospitable.  Five stars for the service.  Kids had oatmeal and Mickey Mouse pancakes with a cup of cocoa.  All good and if you don't mind a noisy dining experience with super tight spaces but good food come here. Outdoor patio dining here too:)"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here twice while on a short four day trip in AZ. Loved the food. A lot of choice, yummy pancakes, eggs Benedict, good coffee. I only wish I could move this place to Wilmington, DE!"}
{"text":"Ate here today and brought a dear friend for his 68th birthday. The COFFEE was delicious and the omelette were so fluffy. Pancakes and French toast were off the hook. We shared between 3 and it was excellent. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Update to my last comment. Today is Resurrection Sunday and I expected it to be busy and this restaurant is very efficient. The service was prompt and the food, besides being very good  came very quickly. I'm leaving now as not to slow down the service here....3rd time is a charm..."}
{"text":"Anytime we're in Scottsdale for breakfast we always make it to Butters. Excellent food, staff and atmosphere. Staff also very helpful with directions around town.  Did I mention the GREAT FOOD?  The only downside is trying to decide what to have from their wonderful menu! We'll be back and try lunch. Thank you, Butters!"}
{"text":"Nothing special about the place, or the service, BUT the Breakfast was very tasty! Had the skillet, bacon and onions and pancakes... Definitely would return"}
{"text":"After a rather long and eventful evening my friend and I woke up in dire need of a great breakfast... About 2 blocks from my younger brothers house we stumble upon BUTTER's...  The attractive hostess whose name slips my mind mentioned it would be a 15 minute wait. The wait ended up being only 5 minutes in which we were able to have our coffee while waiting.   We were sat outside at a table with an umbrella and then it happened...  Perfect service, a great atmosphere, water jugs at the ready (like a great place should do), free coffee refills, an entire menu of what seems to be delicious food all at astoundingly cheap prices and one of the most beautiful women in town Jessica!   She recommended the Mexicana Omelette right away and it is one of the BEST breakfast dishes I have ever had!!!   Thank You soooo much Jessica for such a wonderful breakfast experience. I recommend this place to any and everyone! Can you tell I love my breakfast ;)"}
{"text":"Whole Hog Skillet is the way to order, packed with sausage, bacon & ham. This is for the hungry appetite! Coffee here is delicious & it's from a local company! If you plan on visiting over the weekend... Go early to beat the rush!! I'm a regular here!!"}
{"text":"Yummy! Yummy! Yummy!!! What else can I say!?! Read some of the reviews, and I have to agree... This place is ridiculous (in a good way) and this is how breakfast should be done!! If you go, go early. We got there about 745a and they was a very short wait. By the time we left, the line/wait to get in was long... But it is worth it."}
{"text":"I'd come back for breakfast but we sat inside and it was SO LOUD. The clanking of dishes plus the ambient background music was too much for the ears.  The food was better than average and service was great.  Will probably try and get an outside seat next time."}
{"text":"I loved the wildberry bliss pancakes. The denver omelet was fine, but the pancakes were awesome."}
{"text":"Whenever I come to Phoenix this is my go-to spot. Everything is always on point. I'm a breakfast lover and you'll love it."}
{"text":"The food was good but nothing extraordinary. The New Mexico skillet chorizo had too many onions.  The pancakes were very good. I'm not sure overall this place is any better than IHOP.."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our entire meal & would definitely come again! I enjoyed the fluffiest omelet I've ever eaten, the Cheese Grits were amazing, and the Berry Blitz pancakes were out of this world!"}
{"text":"Love this place, is the perfect place to bring your family or your loved one for Sunday brunch. Great atmosphere, excellent food and very nice owners&friendly staffs. Monika is our favorite waitress, she is the best! Thank you butters pancake for your support of silent auction gift card for the Desert Canyon Elementary School, we really appreciated."}
{"text":"The bartender at our resort recommended this place for breakfast. It was a quick /easy walk and soooo worth it. Delicious pancakes and great scramble. Staff very nice and helpful and food came quickly and hot."}
{"text":"Wow! Breakfast was amazing. We had the Mexican omelette and California scrambler. The hashbrowns were pretty much to die for. The fruit was fresh. The service was excellent. The probability we'll return is high."}
{"text":"Wow! Is all I have to say. Long line and wait... but so worth it. I got the banana cream French toast and I was blown away. So original... you can't get this anywhere. Also ordered the Nutella French toast, hash browns and bacon... everything tasted like quality food. I will always come here for a good breakfast!"}
{"text":"So worth the 40 min wait! Great service and the food was amazing. We ordered right away and our food was on the table in about 10 min."}
{"text":"Waited for about 45 minutes on a Saturday morning, asked to be seated inside. Got sat outside instead, even though it was 100 degrees out we were so hungry we said it was fine. The table appeared to be clean until we saw lipstick marks on one of the mugs, waitress said she'll bring a new one but I asked her to just take them all since it was clear they had no idea which ones had been cleaned. After we ordered we received our food not even 10 minutes later, making me think they did not make it fresh. 10 minutes after we got our food we got the check. Spent the longest amount of time just waiting to be seated. Overall the food tasted average but had a neat atmosphere."}
{"text":"Thank you fellow Yelpers for another great breakfast experience.  I drove here based on your reviews!    Service was good.  Menu had a nice variety including Gluten free options.  Food was good.  I highly recommend this place.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Awesome food. Good service. I highly recommend the breakfast burrito."}
{"text":"Absolutely phenomenal restaurant! Best pancakes in the entire city and the staff is very friendly! The environment is incredible and very welcoming, especially for families. I personally recommend the fish and chips or anything they serve that contains eggs. The orange juice is the best I have ever tasted, bar none! Definitely go here if you are ever in town and make sure you order the pancakes. You will not regret it!!!"}
{"text":"This is by FAR my favorite breakfast place in Scottsdale. The management and staff (Chris, Danny, Jessica and a lovely server Jane ) go above and beyond to make me feel like my business is appreciated! They knew me by name by the third time i went in there. Food literally takes 3-5 minutes to come out, and its always fresh and SO yummy. I always get the same thing, but have tried almost the entire menu. Space is clean, inside and outside seating available. Love love love this place. BEST OMELETS EVER! My husband and I are regulars, we go about twice a week. Great, great place. I can't brag enough!  **edited for a few notes- I've noticed people giving 1,2 and 3 star reviews for not being able to get in and seated WHEN they wanted to. This is Scottsdale, people! You can't walk in ANYWHERE on the weekends and expect to get seated in less than an hour. It's a smaller restaurant, and they do a killer job at getting people sat as soon as possible, without making the diners feel rushed. People also complained about not having the option for flavored creams- I am a breakfast PROFESSIONAL! (in my opinion. I just love breakfast food!) VERY FEW breakfast places offer flavored cream. If you're looking for a specialty coffee ,walk next door to the Village Coffee or go up the road to Starbucks. Giving a 2 or 3 star review for experience because you couldn't get french vanilla cream? Get over yourself. Servers offer flavored lattes if you don't like drip coffee (which theirs is local, and delicious). One guy gave a 1 star review because he just couldn't believe that it wasn't organic. THEY DON'T PRETEND TO BE ORGANIC. How many places can you go and find all organic, all natural food? You want to be that picky? Stay home, jerk. Another guy was mad they didn't have free coffee at the front. Again, where can you go and get a free drink just because you're waiting? Isn't a line a good sign a restaurant? READING THESE NEGATIVE REVIEWS ABSOLUTELY INFURIATES ME. A bunch of closed-minded jackasses looking for a handout**"}
{"text":"This place was delicious, quick, reasonably priced AND they have espresso drinks/lattes which takes it over the top!! I always crave a flavored iced latte when I go out to breakfast, but they usually only have hot coffee. Also, my husband had some of their OJ and it was great, tasted freshly squeezed. The wildberry pancakes were so very good, and his sante fe omelette was yummy too, with a lot of food. We will definitely stop here again when we are in town."}
{"text":"Fantastic. Just fantastic. The best breakfast spot there is in Scottsdale. (And you can tell by the line!!) On Sunday mornings, be ready ti stand in line for maybe an hour. People love this place.   I have had their pancakes, French toast, eggs benny, and they are all fantastic!!!!! Personal favorites are the Country Benny & the protein pancakes. Also try their cheese grits & biscuits. So good!   You must go here for a weekend breakfast. But get there early or just plan on waiting a little bit. Not bad though if you're in a group."}
{"text":"Visited again Twice this week - great service, food and ambience 5 stars hands down  I've been to this location about four or five times since it's recent opening and it's a great restaurant to go to for breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"Good food very large portions. Gets busy on Sundays be prepared to wait 30-45min. Great place for kids."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for the longest time!! I live on the west side and come to this side of town only so often. It's a bit smaller than I thought it would be. Nice buzzing atmosphere! The tables turn pretty quickly so after waiting a bit we were seated. We already knew what we wanted to order since we looked at the menu when we were waiting, so we ordered straight away after we got our drinks. And boy!! The food came out so quick!! The portions are amazingggg. I ordered the California scramble with hash browns and wild berry pancakes. My friend customized his omelette with hash browns and banana creme pancakes. These pancakes are the real deal. They are up there on my list of some of the best pancakes I've had. Flavorful and fluffy. Everything was on point. I just wish I had a larger stomach to fit everything!! Will definitely recommend!! Hope to return soon : ) also want to shout out to the staff, they are friendly, attentive, and working hard!"}
{"text":"Absolutely stellar, high-quality food with outstanding service. From the moment you step foot inside the restaurant you are greeted by a genuine, kind host. They seat promptly, with water already awaiting you at your table. I asked for pancakes, scrambled eggs with sausage, hash browns, and a cappuccino frost.   Where to start?! The cappuccino frost is a delicious blended coffee drink. Butters has a real espresso machine, and the man preparing the coffee prepared it with delight. I mean, I could taste the joy in this coffee. SO GOOD.   The eggs were cooked to perfection; super flavorful and extraordinarily fluffy. The sausage was delicious, as were their pancakes. The hash browns aren't the traditional hash browns one is accustomed to; they're more like scalloped potatoes. BUT they are delicious nonetheless.  The only thing that makes the food even more enjoyable is the wonderful attitude all the employees have. The environment and ambiance is very lovely. Easily one of my favorite breakfast joints!"}
{"text":"Everything was amazing!!! We had breakfast here 4 times while on vacation, and talk about the experience today. We don't know who is cooking, but you earned some serious respect here my friend. Can't wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"Wait for it, wait for it, wait some more, there are empty tables, wait for it,wait for it. Hmmm, still empty tables, lots of people outside. Whew... now we can sit.  Finally it is time for the best eggs is Arizona. The pancakes and waffles are tops too. Iced tea, perfection. Hot tea served with honey as expected. Probably the best breakfast in the country! If it weren't for the un-necessary extra wait this would be our new breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Two part review:   Food. Was wonderful. Pancakes were absolutely delicious. Maybe the best I've ever had although Liberty Market in Gilbert are outstanding. The whipped butter on the cakes was to die for. The eggs look a little strange but trust me, try them they were amazing as well.   Ambiance/ noise level: almost couldn't be worse. The noise level inside is intolerable. No exaggeration it is easily as loud as a club. This is one of the noisiest restaurants I've ever been in. We HAD to go outside. I think we would have had to leave if outside wasn't an option.  Suggestion: please get noise reducing panels or something, anything, to reduce the noise. It ruins the dining experience."}
{"text":"Food was amazing!!! My friend was in town visiting & it was the best scramble she had ever had! The wild berry & banana pancakes were super yummy!"}
{"text":"Don't be turned off by the 45 minute wait! IT IS WELL WORTH IT!! We drove in from Los Angeles, (a five hour drive), delirious and famished. They were very accommodating, very welcoming and wonderful conversationalists. Danny, the manager?, was from Chicago and periodically checked up on us to make sure we were enjoying ourselves. He is funny and great with kids. Kind of place we would repeatedly go back to if we lived closer.   The food: We ordered the Denver Omelette, grits, French toast for the kiddos, Mexican omelette and Pancakes (so yummy!). The omelettes were sooo fluffy and huge!!! The ham was extra tasty and the grits were so creamy! I'm from the South and those grits were the best tasting grits we've ever had. We scraped our plates! There was nothing left! Great food. Great conversation. We Will go back!"}
{"text":"First off we live on the other side of town from this location (buckeye) and it was worth the drive. I would make the drive again, repeatedly. We had the banana nut bread french toast and the whole hog skillet. We also upgraded the pancakes with the skillet to the wild berry bliss. Nothing was dissapointing. The French Toast was very well done and the pancakes was one of the best combinations of flavors I've had in a long time. The skillet was great, lots of meat and potatos and cheese. Prices were not high and the staff was very friendly. We will will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Such an amazing place for breakfast! The oj is the best I have ever had. So fresh and cold. I loved the 2 egg breakfast. Unfortunately my hands were faster to get the food in my mouth before I could take a picture."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast! First time there today and now I see why there is a line all the time on the weekend. I had the Mexican omelette and the salsa verde on top was to die for! Not expected on an omelette but so tasty! This three egg omelette was huge definitely enough to share for two plus it came with potatoes and pancakes. I took over half my meal home in a box. I tried the wild berry bliss pancakes and they were delicious. The vanilla mascarpone topping with the fresh berries was a perfectly sweet combo with the buttermilk pancake batter base. Coffee was okay but the food blew me away. I will definitely be back to try more on the menu."}
{"text":"We found this place while looking for breakfast on Yelp. We arrived to find a crowded restaurant on a Monday morning. Said there would be 15 minute wait and it was. Place is very bright and airy and very clean, so the wait was enjoyable, more or less.  I ordered the Mexicana Omelette, filled with Chorizo and covered with green sauce. It was damn good! Wifey ordered the Country Benny. She loved hers as well. This place is going to be seeing more of us."}
{"text":"Visiting from Los Angeles and couldn't be more thankful to have found Butters! Being from Texas I've missed having good grits, not only are their's delicious but they are unique, very creamy and not to be missed. You can't go wrong with anything you order at Butters. We visited 3 times during our week long stay in Scottsdale and looking forward to making Butters or first stop when we return. Weekends had a 30 min seating wait (worth it) but our food came out within 5-10 minutes. Yum!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Cute environment. Great scrambles and omelets. Also had a great coffee shop area. Wait was long, but worth it!"}
{"text":"Butters is close to my office so I must say in this review I'm a bit biased because they are so convenient for lunch and always get my to go order ready really quickly. My constants are either the cobb salad with honey mustard or the California chicken club with French fries. I'm unhealthily addicted to the French fries and would put the honey mustard dressing on absolutely anything I would eat ever. It's home made and delicious. Now the reason this is only a 4 star is your pricing. $3.45 for 3 scrawny pieces of bacon that are as thin as 2 pencils put next to each other? really? And over $5.00 for an Orange Juice? I know it's Scottsdale but re-visit that pricing structure Butters! Either way, my wallet may eternally be unhappy with me, but I will continue to be loyal because of the convenience and the consistency of deliciousness."}
{"text":"Butters is a great choice for breakfast! The restaurant is extremely well run. Clean, efficient, great service. And the food.....delicious. I had the Popeye scrambler and it was perfect. It comes with hash browns and pancakes, and all of the food was hot, and tasty. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best breakfast joint in Scottsdale, mayoral of Arizona hands down! Melt in your mouth pancakes, steel cut oatmeal, precision prepared over easy eggs. Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"I decided to come in one more time to give this place another chance. I was given a server named Hannah. Complete opposite of the other. She was fast, nice, and very helpful. As long as Hannah works there, they have a regular."}
{"text":"We heard that it was a very popular place for breakfast, we gave it a try last Sunday. We waited 45 minutes for a table (I told you this place was very popular!!) I got the eggs Benedict with the fresh grapefruit juice (which was very refreshing).  However, we felt really rushed by our waitress, it seemed that the only thing she cares about was getting her tips at the end of the meal. She gave us our check in the middle of eating our breakfast.. Seriously, wait a little bit! We didn't wait 45 minutes outside to eat in 10 minutes ! That is mainly the reason why I am giving 3 stars."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today.  Very cool layout and friendly service.    I had the meat lovers skillet with pancakes as a side.  I choose to upgrade the pancakes for the banana creme topping.  That turned out to be a great choice!    I will be returning soon to try the other tasty dishes I seen go by my table!"}
{"text":"No waiting on a Monday. I ordered the large OJ which came in a cold glass it was heaven. I ordered my favorite pecan waffle with sliced bananas, also wonderful. My husband ordered the Banana bread french toast, very delicious almost didn't need any syrup. I love the fresh squeezed OJ so much that I would buy a gallon to go if I could. They keep a carafe of water at the table so you can refill as needed. Every trip to AZ will include a visit to Butters/Butterfields for breakfast. Please, Please open in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Had the Mexican skillet. Simply amazing. The service was great. You will be surrounded by the locals. You can't go wrong with the fresh squeeze orange juice."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy cafe! Most definitely get the buttermilk pancakes! Their fruit is supper fresh and yummy! Sometimes the service is very slow and they make you a long time to get your food."}
{"text":"Love this place. I hesitate to write this because it is already hard to get in here. I was told this was owned by the same people who own Butterfields on Shea. It has many similarities. Fresh squeezed juice (out of this world), and an AUTHENTIC EGGS BENEDICT!!!! The fruit is fresh and only the choicest morsels. Pancakes and bacon, you may as well be in Manhattan. As a matter of fact, I detected a lot of NY/NJ accents in the place during my visits.... My recommendation, go early or off hours or you will be sitting in the sun outside for an hour. But so worth every minute, I assure you."}
{"text":"Great brunch place! My friend and I came here after a strenuous hike in Camelback Mountain... we devoured pancakes and eggs! Great service and excellent fresh squeezed OJ and coffee too. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Hands down best breakfast food ever, not to mention true fresh squeezed orange juice! !!"}
{"text":"This review has been a long time coming. My lady and I hit up Butters on the regular, usually Saturdays or Sunday mornings. If you get there early enough, you can avoid waiting too long. There's a special time in the late morning, when all the early risers are leaving Butters, and all the good parking spots open up. You'll have to wait a few minutes longer, but it's worth the 20 less steps you'll have to take to get into the diner.  While you're waiting, you can order coffee-type beverages from the barista at the front. It's not the best, and I'd advise just waiting until you're seated to order the house blend.  The staff is obsessively attentive, but not annoyingly so. They zoom in with coffee -- iced during the summer, of course -- and take our orders, which arrive within 5-6 minutes, without fail. I fear that they have developed some nanosynthesis food production technology. Or maybe they're just really good at being a diner.  I'm the kind of guy that has a \"usual\" at restaurants. Butters is no exception. I'll get three eggs poached, bacon, hashbrowns and protein pancakes. When I'm feeling unusual, I'll opt for one of their skillets or omelets. Whatever you get here, you're going to love it. My girlfriend gets the berry bliss or strawberry cheesecake french toasts, which I am more than happy to partake in. I never leave Butters feeling underfed or unsatisfied.  I've never ordered from their lunch menu, so I can't offer my opinion on it. I'm not curious enough to find out. Butters isn't my \"lunch\" place, and I hate change."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  I had the Mexican Omelette and the chorizo was very tasty and the green chile was very flavorful. My wife had one of the scrambles and she loved it, but what put her meal over the top was she upgraded to the blueberry pancakes (for $.99) and she LOVED them - especially the mascarpone filling!  When we got there they said 15 min wait bu we were seated in less than 5 mins and our waiter (Antonio) was fantastic.  Got our food to us quickly, refilled water and ice tea without being asked and made some really good suggestions on the menu. We will definitely be going back and we live 20 minutes away!  This place is worth the trip."}
{"text":"I have wanted to try this place for a while now and finally had the chance when my dad came to visit. We went on a Monday morning around 10am and the place was packed. Granted, it was mainly retired folk (or snowbirds). Despite being packed, we only waited about 5 minutes before a table was ready for us. We were taken to the back of the restaurant and sat in a booth with a window view. Our waitress was extremely quick to show up and take drink orders. I asked about the biscuits and gravy and she offered me a small taste of the gravy. I thought this was really nice of her and since it tasted pretty good, I ordered the biscuits and gravy with eggs over easy. My dad ordered the Mexican egg burrito with sauce on top. In less than 10 minutes, our food arrived. My dad dug into his burrito and thought it was the best thing ever. I tried a small bite and it was good. My B&Gs were good, but after several bites into the dish, it was just too much. (I like a lot of sausage in my gravy and this one was lacking.) Definitely not the best B&Gs I've had and I wouldn't order them again from here if I came back.  Butter's has a lot of other tasty sounding items on their menu, but overall I wasn't impressed. There are a lot of other great breakfast places in Scottsdale that I'd much rather frequent."}
{"text":"When you get there you will find a great hosting experience right out of the box... The Lobby is often full and of people excited to eat. Expect a 15 to 45 minute wait to be seated... But don't let that stop you the food is worth the wait. The tables generally turn over fast with excellent professional service both out on the floor and in the kitchen. They provide both indoor and outside seating for your preference...   Butters is a great breakfast and lunch experiences if you are looking for a great place to eat in Scottsdale.    Enjoy   ~ Rob"}
{"text":"First time at this location but have been to both other Butter's Scotts-Day-O locations numerous times.  They did a great job with the interior design, revamping a previously failed restaurant / dry cleaner / etc.    I went with my beautiful bride and we had uncharacteristic splurge on pancakes and EGGS.  We each had a Scrambler which is a great way to go as it's not as heavy as an omelette.  Deanna had pecan pancakes and I had chocolate chip pancakes.  Wonderful, wonderful, food.  SERVICE:  Simply outstanding.  Monica was our server and very attentive, professional, knowledgeable, and hard working.  You simply can't do better in Scott-Day-O for breakfast dining.  If you have not been, give it a try.  It will increase your humanity for the day by at AT LEAST 11%   !!"}
{"text":"Not really anything special.  Service was efficient and without personality.  The portions were huge and fine tasting.  I think it's annoying that they charged me $.50 for an extra salsa (small ramekin of jarred salsa).  The fresh squeezed juice was yummy.  Why don't places use cage free eggs?  How is it any better than McDonalds if the eggs are all from chickens stuffed in cages and pumped with antibiotics?  Too bad, it's location is perfect but I would say it's just mediocre."}
{"text":"I had the Whole Hog scramble, side of pancakes and coffee. It was simply the best breakfast I've had in a long time! Even the coffee was great."}
{"text":"Very good food at fair prices.  Good menu choices for breakfast and lunch.  Staff always friendly.  Service fast.  Same menu at all three Butters restaurants in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Been here several times everything is amazing and they make their own orange juice make it right before bringing it to your table"}
{"text":"Breakfast was excellent. The service was quick and attentive considering it's spring training season. PThe classic benny, mexicana omelette and signature strawberry pancakes were all on point. Side note: they have a barista, but even the standard coffee at the table is better than most. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Have absolutely nothing bad to say abt this spot .. This was my 1st visit n yes I was a lil hungover so I ordered like 4-5 items and dam! .. Our server Willie was just about perfect. The food came fast, as ordered, hot, fresh and super tasty. Every server was down to help out n make the visit as seamless as possible. Def be back!"}
{"text":"Butters is an upscale daytime eatery. Bright and light ambiance with up-scale versions of standard diner menu fare. Ample and friendly staff. Excellent food quality. Its the pricier, more urban version of \"First Watch\"."}
{"text":"Butters Pancakes & Cafe is a solid breakfast spot in Scottsdale. The place is usually slammed on the weekends but honestly it's worth the wait, grab a coffee and relax in the usually insanely perfect Arizona weather.   I got their Corned Beef hash skillet which was super good - it came with hash browns, jack and cheddar cheese and 2 eggs of my choice. It's served with Pancakes or toast, I ordered the pancake which I was thrilled about because the pancake was perfection!   My friend got the eggs verde which was corn tortilla, black beans, jack cheese, 2 eggs (any style), and topped with green new mexico chile sauce. Served with hash browns or grits. They were super thrilled with their selection as well.   Coffee was good and they have fresh squeezed OJ as well!  Def worth a visit if your looking for some solid breakfast food!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! We're not from around here so we even ordered our pancakes again right after because we loved them so much! Can not rave enough about how good these pancakes are I only wish we had this place in the Bay Area!"}
{"text":"I say 3 stars. Kids say 5 stars, so on average 4 stars. I prefer trendy, healthy options. My veggie omelet was extremely lack luster with miniscule, tasteless diced vegetables. I added bacon, which I really could not find in it. I think they were mini bacon crumbles. I have enjoyed Denny's omelets more. Kids really enjoyed their Irishman eggs Benedict and chocolate chip pancakes. IHOP type menu. Kids said better than IHOP. Service and coffee were good."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast this morning, and must say, despite the long wait (even at 1pm!), it was worth it!! Their coffee is fantastic, as is their serving staff. I got the deliciously craving-satiating Wild Berry Bliss Cakes (pancakes with wild berries, stuffed with vanilla marscapone cream and drizzled with vanilla and raspberry sauce). I've heard raves about their eggs rojos, so I'll be ordering those the next time 'round. The person I came with said their corned beef hash was perfection and loved how they added chopped green onion.  The place is a bit small, but I suppose that only adds to the charm. The patio area is cozy and misted."}
{"text":"Best orange juice ever!!  Solid, fast breakfast.  French dip is the best call on the lunch menu."}
{"text":"Had a mini vacation and ate here 2 days in a row. The food is to die for! But on top of that the espresso and fresh squeezed OJ ...... just wow! Even though they were very busy my food came out very quickly. Today I sat on the patio and that joust enhances your experience. I will definitely be back when I am in the area."}
{"text":"I had a previous negative experience/review with a manager here. Recently went back in and had a great service and meal. I have deleted that review and it goes to show one experience does not speak for all. I recommend and will be frequenting. Good ambience and they have a  fresh squeezed OJ machine right out in the open ensuring your Vitamin C is fresh and made to order."}
{"text":"Any restaurant that offers gluten-free options automatically gets a boost in my book...and their GF pancakes are delicious! They taste very similar to buttermilk pancakes. I had been craving pancakes for so long but am allergic to wheat, so when my friend told me about this place, I was so excited.  Haven't tried the gluten-free Belgian waffles yet but that's next on my list.  When the weather is nice, it can be a 45 minute wait for first-available seating on Sundays (that's when my boyfriend and I go), but they do offer a coffee and juice bar while you wait.   I just wish they transformed more of their options to gluten-free.. I've been dying for some Eggs Benedict... Butters, please get some gluten-free English muffins so I can order some! :D"}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing service! Alex was our waitress, she was very organized with our large group of soccer families."}
{"text":"The food was wonderful and the service was excellent.  Cassie, our waitress was Awesome.  We had the pleasure of dining there twice for breakfast and Cassie was our waitress on both days.  Our group ranged from 5 to 7 people over the course of our two visits.  Cassie was such a pleasure to accommodate our large group plus our to go orders for family at home.  We recommend the eggs, grits, coffee, hash browns, and pancakes.  The grits and eggs are truly delicious.  Our breakfast for our vacations to Scottsdale will always include a stop at Butters.  Hopefully, with Cassie as our waitress!"}
{"text":"Great diner-like experience with a huge menu selection. Try the fresh-squeezed orange juice with whatever you order."}
{"text":"My husband's favorite breakfast restaurant. The food is delicious, consistent, and comes in ample quantity. The hash browns are perfect every single time. The servers are friendly and helpful, and always check back to make sure your food is as you like it.  There is a wait on weekend mornings, but most other times they seem to be able to seat you immediately. We go back over and over as it is always just perfect. Be sure to order the orange juice. It is worth it."}
{"text":"My daughter and I came here for breakfast pretty early during the week and we were really pleasantly surprised. She got a waffle with a side of eggs and I got a skillet with poached eggs and a side of their cinnamon roll pancakes. Everything we ordered was really good, but OMG those cinnamon roll pancakes were ridiculous. I have no idea how they get them to be such a perfect texture, and obviously the taste was amazing. I am not even really a pancake person and I never would have ordered them had they not come with my meal. They also have other specialty pancakes, like banana cream and wild berry. I seriously want to come back and try them all. I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"My current obsession is with eggs, and more specifically, with omelettes, and Butters has become my weekly go-to for my protein heavy craving.    To start, any egg or omelette dish you order is going to be cooked to perfection.  I don't know how they get their eggs so light and airy, but it's magical and I'm happy to put stock into.  My favorite has been the Mexicana omelette with chorizo, jalapeno cheese, avocado and topped with New Mexican green chili.  It's awesome.  What's even more awesome? You get 2 side dishes to add to it.  My go-to's are the cheese grits (I'd order these on their own if they didn't come with it - so good!) and the pancakes.  Butters is known for their pancakes and there's a good reason for it - they're fantastic!  If you love breakfast foods, you should definitely give Butters a try!! :)"}
{"text":"Great spot for breakfast/brunch! Portions are very large. Staff seems decent. Expect to wait on the weekends. The misters on the patio do not work the best, wait a little longer to sit inside during the summer."}
{"text":"Loved this place! It reminded me of Butterfields on Shea and later learned they are sister restaurants. Menu is similar and food is on point just like Butterfields. I'm amazed at the high level of service too! So friendly and attentive. Wish I lived closer to this location cause me and my family would be here all the time!!   Check this place out fo sho!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good! Went here when I was in Phoenix for a wedding and stopped here on our way to the airport. Everything was fresh and as described on the menu. Prices were reasonable and service was good!"}
{"text":"Our daughter recommended this establishment and we arrived around 9:45 AM. Had a 25-30 minute wait. Their estimation was on the money. Sat in a corner booth looking out over the restaurant. Quite busy for a Sunday morning. Our server didn't say her name, but from the receipt, it was Monica. She was thorough and knew the menu. I had a small glass of freshly squeezed Orange Juice which was $3.39 and coffee was $2.75. Both hit the spot. I ordered the  create your own Omelette: Monterey Jack, mushrooms and ham which came with hash browns and my choice of pancakes over toast. My daughter had the Country Benedict and my wife had the Eggs Rojo and fruit cup. All the entrees run around $9.50.  The hash browns aren't your typical shredded style, but sliced like potato chips which was pretty good. The omelette was fluffy and a little dry, so I added some catsup which did the job. The pancakes was light and the meal held me over til dinner. My wife enjoyed her Eggs Rojo and my daughter was stuffed with her eggs benedict. Will difinitely return."}
{"text":"This place had very good food. My wife had French toast and I the crepes. Each with its own gourmet style to them. Very good food and service. Worth the 45 minute wait. Outside the restaurant is a neat area to browse around, grab a coffee, or just relax by the fountain."}
{"text":"I would say this place is meh.  Unless you love a super sweet breakfast which I hear the berry or cinnamon roll pancakes are great everything on the menu is par for the course.  A little unseasoned and they do not serve liquor.  Is it even brunch if there is no mimosa options?  I am giving them a lower rating because of their staff.  We had a large party and they gave us an hour wait time which was fine.  However, after only 15 minutes they were ready and annoyed by us not having our whole party immediately there saying that they would not seat us.  Some of my party had gone to go get coffee elsewhere as they did not want to wait.  We were seated however and the waitress came quickly and took orders.  However, as soon as plates were being picked up checks hit the table and the signed bill was taken quickly. This rush made us feeling like we had to leave immediately.  There are so many other wonderful breakfast places in Scottsdale that I would pass on going back to Butters."}
{"text":"Hands down the best breakfast place in AZ. When asked where I wanted to eat for my birthday breakfast, this was my only pick. Well worth the hour drive from Buckeye for us. The wildberry pancakes are the best dang pancakes I have ever had and I'm partial to my own. They are surprisingly not very sweet, but just right. The mascarpone cream center is drool worthy. Let's not forget the most perfect fluffy eggs and crispy hashbrowns. All 3 of us licked our plates clean. Not one crumb left. Also, if you are worried about the wait, don't be. The food comes out so fast I seriously don't know how they do it. I don't even think it took 10mins! They are miracle workers."}
{"text":"Came here while visiting in Scottsdale. AMAZING breakfast!!! Had the Eggs Benny and husband had ham and cheese omelette with side of pancakes. Everything was delicious!!!"}
{"text":"We were seated right away on a busy Saturday morning, and our server was friendly and attentive throughout our meal. The buttermilk pancakes and syrup were delicious, as were the eggs. Everything tasted fresh and yummy... just what we wanted for breakfast. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Best breakfast in all of AZ!! Even their Orange Juice is the best I've ever had! My favorite is their French toast but their Gluten Free pancakes are amazing! I don't understand how they can taste better than normal pancakes but they do. I recently moved to Gilbert so I don't go as often as I wish I could but if it's a special occasion you better believe we're starting our day at Butters!"}
{"text":"We almost ate at our hotel before we headed to the airport, but this was SO worth the extra waking up. :)  My husband got the New Mexico Skillet and upgraded the pancakes to Oreo S'more Pancakes.  I got the Eggs Verde.  We both got dishes with egg whites.  They were both SO delicious.  Both were so flavorful and yummy.  The Oreo Pancakes were too sweet for my husband's taste in the morning, but I would've ate it all if we weren't hopping on a plane shortly after. I wish we had one in Chicago!  Service was pretty good."}
{"text":"Like SEVERAL others, the low rating is due to the manager and hostess rudeness and poor customer service. This location is not friendly to groups, business meetings, parties, etc.    This location (and ONLY this location of Butters/Butterfields) claims that they have a policy that parties will not be seated until the entire party arrives.  If you read the other reviews, you will see that we are not the only party that has encountered this.  A manager with good customer service skills would seat the partial party and get them started on beverages and starters, and make more money in the process. The manager, Antonio was rude. We did not asked to be seated ahead of anyone else; there were very few people there early on a Sunday morning.    The food was wonderful as was our server, but we will take our group elsewhere in the future.  Everyone with a group should do that."}
{"text":"I've been to Butters five times now, and it's gotten progressively less impressive. The 30 minute plus wait in the heat, extremely loud interior, feeling like I'm being rushed out of my table...and the quality of the food is incredibly variable (sometimes, the has browns are soggy and undercooked. The next weekend, half of them are burned. IHOP has more consistent quality).  Yes, the eggs Benedict is delicious and the OJ is awesome, so it's not the worst place to eat, especially for first timers.    Despite all of the problems, and feeling that the waitresses absolutely do not want to be there, I kept coming here for the Wildberry Toast.  However, they completely changed the recipe. As of last Wednesday, there is no longer a Wildberry filling, instead, they placed the cream topping between two slices of French toast, and sloppily drizzle some of the Wildberry topping from the previous version.  The menu doesn't reflect the changes (yet).   Butters could be so much better--with more attentive wait staff and attention to quality of the food. Unfortunately, I'll be looking for a new Scottsdale breakfast location for now."}
{"text":"Simply fantastic!  Great food, omelet was iron chef perfect! Amazing coffee! Not normal in a place like this! Superb,appropriate service..... constant, but not overbearing coffee refills....  Pleasant setting outside, albeit near busy intersection.  Eat here!"}
{"text":"Pancake quest victory!  Since this business is owned by the same people as Butterfields, I expected a great breakfast and was not disappointed.  It's not the same menu, but plenty of eggs, omelettes, Benedicts, waffles, pancakes, and French toast to choose from.  The service was speedy.  The blueberry pancakes are as good as they get.  Plenty of blueberries inside, and a steaming hot blueberry compote on top.  If you like your pancakes light and fluffy, this is the place -- maybe even a record.   I'm just saving that fifth star till they get patio furniture.  For now you must eat inside, though the location for the patio is great."}
{"text":"Best breakfast I have ever had. This place is open only til 1 and it gets packed quick so hurry up, get dressed, and just go there. All of their food is wonderful and the staff are very courteous"}
{"text":"This place is overrated. Average pancakes and long line. OJ was really good while waiting."}
{"text":"For the food: 5 Stars The food was absolutely amazing and it came out within 15 minutes. Everything was cooked perfectly and tasted amazing. Our server was also extremely friendly and provided amazing service.  For the service:      Aside from our server, the service we received from the hostesses (there were two) was absolutely pitiful. Before I even walked up to get a table, the first hostess had a sour face like she hated being there and everyone in the building. Then, upon walking up, she had a horrible attitude that showed through her voice when talking to me. As I tried to get my table, she talked to me like I was some type of peasant or something. She rarely made eye contact and just stared at her screen the entire time. If I could describe her voice through an emoji, it would sound like \"\". Like \"whatever just get the table and go away\". I'm sure that's what she was thinking.       So after I requested the table, she asked for my number and I assumed they would use it to call me. It was a 30-45 minute wait so I just sat in my car close by. I know this place is popular so I didn't mind the wait. I expected it. So after about 45 minutes, I went in and waited just to see if I was up next. After about 5 minutes, I didn't hear my name called and saw that, even when people didn't respond to them calling people for tables, they made no effort to go hunt them down or call their phones. So I went up and asked the second hostess if my name had been called. She also had an attitude but not as severe as the first hostess. This one made me feel like a burden and a dumbass. She told me \"we called your name 21 minutes ago...\". The tone she gave me was like she was saying \"it's not my fault you didn't respond\". So then I told them I didn't receive any text or call or anything and she then said maybe the number was wrong. Then she read my number back and guess what? It was correct, and just like the other people who were outside or somewhere else, they made no attempt to contact us with the phone numbers. Then the hostess said to the other \"just seat them outside\" like I was an annoying customer who wouldn't leave them alone. So the hostess took us to our table without saying anything and it was VERY apparent she was annoyed. I don't expect much from a hostess. At least a measly \"right this way\", but we didn't even get that.   Overall, the food and servers are definitely 5 stars, but both the hostesses were so god awful at their job that it ruined my experience. I hardly review on Yelp and to be honest most of the time I don't care to, but they were so horrible to us that I felt inclined to, to warn others.  I definitely would come back if I could have a different hostess."}
{"text":"Breakfast is the the most important meal of the day and Butters gives its diners a good reason not to miss it!  A fantastic meal in a comfortable modern setting.  The place is crowded but that's not a problem.  The 15 to 20 minute wait goes fast, and the only thing that is faster is the service.  It felt like it was only seconds between when we ordered our meals, and when we received them.  Everything is top notch.  If you're looking for a quick, quality breakfast, look no further."}
{"text":"First time here - sounded good and we were looking for a breakfast spot as always. I think we arrived about 11:00 or so on  warm, sunny Thursday....and there was about a 15 minute wait. We had previously advised that we would take the first open table - inside or outside. On this particular morning it was outside. The atmosphere was very pleasant and the service was prompt as we were served coffee fairly quickly. I had the California Scramble and Honey Dear had the Mexicano omelet. We both appreciated that we could substitute the potatoes for our choice of fresh fruit or cottage cheese and perhaps another option. I chose fresh fruit and Honey Dear chose cottage cheese. Service was surprisingly quick. Nice!!  OK - everything was good but there were a few things I noticed could have used a slight improvement - Coffee - it was ok - I've had better. A little too strong maybe and not smooth enough. It should be really good coffee if the restaurant is a breakfast joint - just my opinion.  California Scramble - pretty good, nice chunks of avocado, could have used more bacon flavor or something. I found myself putting Cholula on it to add some flavor as even the chicken in the scramble was bland. Scramble was good - nicely prepared, looked really appetizing...but missing some defining flavors. Honey Dear really liked his Mexicano omelet - he thought the chorizo added some nice zest. He enjoyed the added avocado but thought they could have put the green sauce on the side as it did not add anything to the dish - a smidge bland. Honey Dear opted for the side of pancakes while I opted for rye toast. Now to some of you this might sound picky but let me say - I LOVE rye bread. Most restaurants have mediocre rye - very few have some really good, toasted and tasty rye bread. This was a mediocre rye toast place. It was good but nothing special.  Pancakes were the same - good but nothing special. Overall we enjoyed our breakfast and would certainly return. Maybe the sweet breakfasts are the dishes that make this restaurant shine. We unfortunately like our savory breakfasts so we will have to return to see if the savory will shine on our next visit."}
{"text":"I had chicken salad and it was definitely delicious. Wait time was none, and service was top notch"}
{"text":"Food was FANTASTIC! Long wait bc of rainy weather keeping dining area options small. Great service. We had the skillets. Hash browns were super delicious and fresh squeezed juice was yummy."}
{"text":"Somewhat of a wait, but after eating here it is no surprise. Wonderful breakfast. Got two eggs over easy with great applewood bacon. It came with hash browns or grits. Tough to get good grits out of the South so I had the cheese grits. Perfect. Also came with toast or pancakes. I asked for gluten free pancakes, no extra charge, and they were great. Very reasonable price. My wife who is not gluten free loved her breakfast as well. If you pass by you have to eat here."}
{"text":"Great every time. My favorite place for breakfast, period.  Hannah and Bianca know me by name and always greet me with a smile and I've never had one mistake on my order, or the execution of the food. I even end all of my clients in there while we tint their car! Five stars  aren't enough."}
{"text":"Awesome banana bread french toast! You don't even need syrup for them but I did put a little bit and even the syrup was light and tasty!!! I would definitely come back! My husband had an omelette and the eggs were so fluffy and light! The cheese in the omelette was so creamy and yummy as well as the mushrooms!!!! Hash browns were also delicious! I would recommend this restaurant to anyone and everyone!!! The waitresses were very cute and nice. Everything was awesome! My kudos to the chefs!!!   If you are ever in Scottsdale this is a DEFINITE stop you HAVE to make for breakfast!!!"}
{"text":"This place lives up to all the great reviews it has been given!!! I was blown away with haw fast the food arrived after being ordered!!! I had the Mexicana Omelette w/ cheese grits and the banana creme pancakes. My wife had the wild berry pancakes. Needless to say, this place is a MUST HaVE while in AZ!!!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast place ever. I live in California, but I look for every opportunity to return.  You have to try the specialty pancakes.  I get the chorizo scramble and the mixed berry bliss pancakes.   Both are fantastic. If you don't want a long wait, come during the week.  A little noisy inside when it's crowded, but the patio is nice with the umbrellas and misters."}
{"text":"Holy cow....far exceeded my expectations. The food was DELICIOUS and our server was PHENOMENAL. We had Benedict, skillet, omelet, and pancakes and everyone loved their food. Dre, our server, was attentive, sweet, and on top of all (of our many) request. She was especially sweet to our two year old making sure she had everything she needed, even though she was busy. By far the best were their potatoes. Highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"We go here for breakfast quite a bit.  I have to put in a review of 5 stars to compliment their service.  They are so nice and do such a good job here plus the food comes out fast."}
{"text":"Butters makes awesome buttermilk pancakes.  The corned beef hash skillet was also fantastic."}
{"text":"I ordered the country benny which was so yummy! And I shared the bananas and cream pancakes. These were the best pancakes I've I had in a while. And that's saying a lot since I don't really like pancakes. Food is amazing, portions are generous, service is friendly and attentive. Only down side is the extremely long wait for a table. We went twice and waited about 1.5hrs each time."}
{"text":"Yummy, quick breakfast. I had a skillet which was quite good. OJ was fresh squeezed and the coffee was nice and hot. My daughter had a bacon waffle and loved it. The food came really fast and was hot."}
{"text":"It was Saturday morning around 10:30 and we had a 45+ minute wait to get seated but it was worth it.  The Whole Hog Skillet is delicious.  Loved the biscuits and gravy.  The cheesy grits were just a bit to creamy but have great flavor.  Don't forget the side of pancakes for 'dessert'.  Oh yeah...the fresh squeezed OJ...addicting."}
{"text":"Would someone else please learn how to replicate these Wild Berry Bliss pancakes?  Seriously, 75 minute wait. There are better ways to deal with long lines Butters!  Your food is good, you should really figure out a way to make getting a seat more convenient. Other restaurants have been using call ahead or apps for years. Please convince me why this isn't a better option??"}
{"text":"We have been going here since we moved to the area. We are not sure if management changed or what, but it has been worse and worse each time we have gone. I ordered an omelette and unfortunately, it was like plastic. The service was horrendous. Our waitress didn't care at all, brought my wrong order, forgot several things, and never came to check on us. We had to ask other servers throughout our time there for help and for the check. We made the decision not to waste our money here anymore. So sad. It used to be wonderful."}
{"text":"Butters is by far the best breakfast joint in the state. Period! You simply won't find better pancakes elsewhere and can always expect great service! At this location, you can enjoy your breakfast on their lovely patio... This is one of my favorite patios in town! Whether it be breakfast, brunch or lunch, this place has great options for everyone. Very reasonable prices, fresh food, and FAST service. When I went last week we got our food within 10-15 minutes - now that's service. I will always recommend Butters to any local or those visiting the area!"}
{"text":"Yummy great place for Sunday brunch the food I'd fantastic and service is excellent. I prefer the location on Hayden but never a disappointment"}
{"text":"Oh, Dragonfly Cafe, why did you have to be closed for breakfast today?  I was almost at DC's doorstep when I decided to use my Yelp app to check on the cafe's hours, and darn it, it was closed!  So, I ended up at Butters, instead.    I arrived at around 10:30a, a bit of a late start since I had to switch venue plans, but no worries, as I would only have to wait about five minutes before being seated outdoors (and it was such a beautiful morning, too!).  I'd have enjoyed listening to the water fountain across from my table a lot more if traffic sounds didn't intrude, but what can I do?  I quickly got over it.  I knew to stay away from the sweeter French toast concoctions, since the pumpkin bread variety I chose for my first visit was too sweet for my taste.  It took me awhile to decide what to have- blueberry pancakes or strawberry cheesecake French toast?  In the end, the write up on the \"house strawberry-mascarpone blend\" made the decision for me.  Ooh, I was looking forward to this!  I wish I had more time to order a cup of coffee from the coffee shop next door, since Butters' drip coffee isn't a fave of mine (or of my Mom's).  I gave it a second try today, and I still don't like it.  The wait for the French toast wasn't long, about ten minutes.  I found my first three or so bites to be delightful, but then I got bored.  I don't think I'd order the dish again, unless I were to share it with someone else knowing that I had another dish to look forward to.  I suppose not all breakfast sweets can be as great as that of the Herb Box's Red velvet pancakes, or even that of Dragonfly Cafe's Bananas foster French toast...  Perhaps I should just stick to the savory items on the menu, such as that salmon/lox omelet we enjoyed on our first trip here.  2.5 stars, but the service was OK, so rounding up to 3.  A shout-out for Rafael and the busser today.  You guys did a great job!"}
{"text":"Sooo good, the service and the food. Stay away from the grits if you're a Southern girl, they don't make them right, but the rest of the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"I'd like to give Butters a higher review because the food was somewhat enjoyable however our server wasn't nice. I believe food can taste wonderful if the server is welcoming and kind, I also believe that no matter how good the food is it can taste like garbage if the server is lack luster.  She wasn't a heinous b**** but she was definitely flirting with my boyfriend and being exceptionally attentive to him and not to me. Never met her in my life so I don't know why I was a witness to such pitiful child like behavior, getting dirty looks and all. I gave her the benefit of the doubt that hey maybe she just lost someone or is suffering idk. She served him first and his food came out piping hot while mine was late and luke warm. When I asked for hot sauce she went inside and disappeared for five minutes then came out and asked another table how they were doing and my boyfriend asked her for hot sauce and within a nano second she grabbed it right behind us and gave it to us.   I definitely do not recommend this place for females accompanied by males because this misogynistic behavior will most likely take place. We're not in the Middle East...we're in America this kind of ridiculous belittlement of women should be stopped.   Tips: check out OVER EASY for a cute and cozy atmosphere and comforting dishes including their signature caramelized banana french toast."}
{"text":"SO SO SO good. I mean seriously I'm thinking about it now and wish I was still in Arizona.   We were in staying in scottsdale for baseball spring training, and went to this breakfast place before a game. We came in without a reservation and did have to wait a good 30 minutes but it was extremely busy and super close to Salt River at Talking Stick Stadium so it was totally understandable.  We ordered the banana creme pancakes, a crepe i don't remember which one, and bacon and hash browns on the side. Everything we had was phenomenal, despite their super busy status it all came out in a timely manner. The server was extremely nice and checked up on us multiple times to make sure we were satisfied.  Price wise the items on the menu seemed very fair and I can understand why this location has consistently great reviews. I would recommend this to anyone in town for baseball or otherwise!"}
{"text":"Winner!  Great spot for brunch.  Sit inside or outside, have yummy pancakes, waffles, crepes, or a more local style skillet.  Fresh juice and coffee, about as good as it comes.  Get here early, line grows."}
{"text":"This has been my husband's and my favorite place to eat breakfast for the past 4 years! The food is delicious! The service is fantastic! A great place to visit all year round!"}
{"text":"This place has breakfast down to a fine art.  They squeeze their own orange juice and you can certainly tell from the wonderful flavor.  The menu has a wide variety of sweet and savory selections.  The service is wonderful, and watching them move is like watching a dance as one glides away from a table after sweeping under it and placing chairs another glides in to replace a high chair with a table chair.  Pure magic and efficiency."}
{"text":"The food was decent however, $40.00 for two cheese burgers and drinks is over the top.  Scottsdale is full of expensive places to eat.  What is needed is places that are more affordable!!"}
{"text":"Eggs Benedict Florentine - delectable Coffee was excellent, would love to know where they get it. Service was just ok, hostesses a bit apathetic but server was on top of her game. Went late on a Sunday so the wait was only about 10 -15 minutes, now sure how I would feel if we had to wait much longer than 30 minutes.  Overall the experience was good, will go back if in the area."}
{"text":"I wish I could click my heels 3 times and be here every single morning for breakfast. The pancakes are so light and airy, the eggs fluffy and buttery, and the coffee perfect! There's almost always a wait to get a table, but it moves pretty fast and it's worth it! The service is also great by its almost TOO fast. You will literally get your order in less than 10 minutes from ordering. So basically you're in and out within 30 min!! Although I appreciate the great service, it kinda feels like they're pushing you to hurry, and isn't that the point of eating out, to enjoy your time at the restaurant and savor the meal and conversation? Anyway, I'll keep coming back because I love it!"}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast here today. Their pancakes are wonderful! My daughter loved the Mickey Mouse pancake and ate nearly everything on her plate. My friend had the Eggs Benedict which they said was delicious and I tried the bacon, eggs, hash browns and pancakes all of which were very very tasty. Also the fresh squeezed orange juice is very good. Service is great too."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculous...in a great way!  Although we waited on a random Thursday morning for about a half hour, it was well worth it.  Service: Very good. Coffee was filled timely and waters were always topped off. Plus his suggestions were brilliant. Food: Since we wanted a mix of sweet (pancakes) and savory (meat and eggs) we decided to go with a scrambler (Santa Fe - Chorizo sausage, red jalapeño pepper, onion & cheddar cheese) and a skillet (New Mexico - Chorizo sausage, onion, green pepper, tomato & avocado). It comes with pancakes on the side (2) AND you can choose any of their special ones for a little upcharge...score! Wildberry Bliss Cakes - Stuffed with blueberries, layered with vanilla mascarpone, topped with vanilla cream, fresh wildberries & glaze...Banana Cream Cakes - Fresh bananas & cream, graham cracker pecan crumb & caramel... Everything was perfect! The savory was seasoned and flavorful. The pancakes were heavy, sweet and delicious.  Prices: Inexpensive. All this food, coffee and tea was less than $30 with tip...no lie. I guess I am used to NJ/NY prices... If you visit Phoenix, this is a must go for breakfast! ENJOY!"}
{"text":"This place is really tasty! The orange juice is amazing! My wife and I shared the Bacon Egg Benedict, and it was delicious! The pancakes were amazing as well. Can't say nothing bad about the food! The service was not as great but the food was amazing. The wait is long but well worth it. The service is the only thing that kept me from adding a 5th star. Definitely recommending this place, and will be back."}
{"text":"Landed at this place per Yelp reviews and I am happy to say- they were right!!! I ordered the New Mexico skillet and it was so good, every ingredient used tasted so fresh in my mouth. The chorizo was so good I almost wanted to have them pack some chorizo to take home haha! My husband made his own omelette  and he loves es it because it was hugeeee. Again, he loolv3d their chorizo. He added jalapeños and they were fresh and crunchy. He picked pancakes as his side and they were perfectly fluffy. Finally my kids order from the kids' menu- their portions were big, cheap, and made with love. Our waitress and hostess were very kind and welcoming. Overheard a manager handle some business with the table next to us and customers were beyond appreciative. Will come back again!"}
{"text":"After trying Butterfield's Pancake House I decided to try its sister venue Butters.  WOW this place is just as good as Butterfields if not better.  The first time I went there I ordered the Eggs Benedict which were dissappointingly small howevere with the side of fresh buttermilk pancakes it was just the right amount.  If they somehow made the portions bigger I would never order anything else on the menu EVER AGAIN!  The second time I went back was with my girlfriend and we had both had a long night of partying and drinking the night before.  I knew walking in that the small eggs benedict would not help with this hangover so I opt'd for the build your own omlet.  I ordered an egg white omlet with bacon tomatoes, onions, green peppers and avocado.  The plate came out and I knew right away it was love at first site.  It was enormous, and oozing with cheese. Just what the doctor ordered.  My girlfriend got the banana bread french toast and we each got sides of bacon and sausage and split some pancakes.  The homemade The two main dishes were amazing and the thick cut bacon was a great sponge for the alcohol sitll in our system.  I can not say enough good things about both Butterfields and Butters.  If I had to choose I would choose Butters, though the menus are very similar Butters seemed to have more of my demographic dining there (mid 20's early 30's) young and energetic.  Butterfield's is more of the family spot or the spot for grandma and grandpa.  I will definitely be going to both again.  KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK  PS- please make your eggs benedict larger!!! :)"}
{"text":"I've never been much of a breakfast guy because too many carbs in the morning makes me sleep all day.  But let me tell you, THIS is a place to visit.  I came here with my compadres Roland (who also reviewed this place), Jenna and Shaun.  Place is in a very nice shopping center, not too far down the road from Jimmy John's (drool).  Let me start with the food.  Something like Strawberry Cheesecake French Toast.  My mom would kill me if I told her it's better than her Creme Brulee French Toast or her Grand Marnier French Toast, so I just won't say anything.  But it is AMAHHHZING.  I ordered a side of sausage and a side of bacon, and I shouldn't have ordered either.  They were also amahhhzing, but the entree was enough to fill me up.  Needless to say, I took a huge nap afterwards.  Every time I see Jenna and Roland check-in without me on Yelp, they get angry texts from me.  This Wednesday I'm having brunch at Butterfield's on Scottsdale and Shea...I'm told it's same ownership?  We shall see if it compares to the deliciousness that was Butters."}
{"text":"Wonderful breakfast with large portions. Had the southwestern breakfast and the pancakes on the side. Yummy!! Wait time was lengthier than we would have preferred. Service was excellent and food as well which made up for the time. Be prepared for a 40 minute wait on a Sunday."}
{"text":"We are traveling in the Scottsdale area and came across this place and stopped in for breakfast. The coffee was great and the food was delicious. Service was excellent never ran out of coffee and water was on the table in a container. I recommend this place."}
{"text":"AMAZING. Went with my best friend and we kept saying how great it was the whole time. Great food, good service, food came our freaky and fast. 10/10 will keep going back. You'll love it!"}
{"text":"My new favorite breakfast spot. The portions are large and yummy. They have a nice patio but be warned the place is always super busy so plan to wait for a table. The wait will be worth it once you taste the pancakes."}
{"text":"I came here yesterday with a friend and we LOVED it! The food was delicious, the service was fast & great, and the restaurant was nicely decorated & clean. We are from Florida and will definitely return to Butters before we leave!"}
{"text":"The pancakes here are AMAZING!!! I would actually say this is one of the best breakfast spots around. Good service and prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Good food, but the ambience felt a wee crowded there.  I prefer Butterfields. :)"}
{"text":"OMG!! The most delicious breakfast that I've had away from home! Service is excellent and fast, and the place is super clean and comfortable!"}
{"text":"So many great reviews by my fellow Yelpers and this place does not disappoint. We decided to go for breakfast after pulling an all-nighter last weekend reached around 6:25 and I kid you not there were people waiting already.  We choose to sit inside but they have a beautiful patio that gets filled up by 7:00 I am relieved when a restaurant is filling up quickly just says a lot about the place.  ~ Banana cream cakes (stack of 3) $9 (Fresh bananas & cream, graham cracker pecan crumb & caramel) ~ Veggie Omelette $10  (tomato, onion, mushroom, green pepper, cheddar cheese) Each additional item .25¢ ~Classic Brioche $8 you can add a Fruit for $1.99 ~ Iced Americano $3  Great Food and Ambience The only reason I stop at 4 stars is the service it could be friendlier. I'd rather see smiling faces, especially in the morning.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"I really hate eating out for breakfast. I'm vegetarian and I also don't like eggs. So, mostly pointless for my to go out for breakfast. I also am not really a fan of sweet breakfast foods like pancakes. Well, this place has the most amazing \"protein\" pancakes and also the best breakfast potatoes. My favorite breakfast food is usually hash browns and these are so good!! This is the only place I look forward to going out to eat for breakfast at. My husband also loves the Mexican skillet. He says it's one of the best breakfasts he has ever had. Also the have fresh squeezed OJ and grapefruit juice!!"}
{"text":"Cant believe how busy it was on a Wed morning! About a 15 minute wait at 9:40 am. Very nice though, prompt service, freshly squeezed fresh OJ, lots of choice. Food was fresh delicious and served quickly. Approx $9 for each item (omelette, burrito, pancakes, eggs benedict). NE corner of Hayden and Via de Ventura. Nice patio with umbrellas and misters."}
{"text":"It was a good place and service, however they have zero options for vegans. They also make zero compromises for special diet needs, such as exchanging ingredients. Whatever you take out and want it replaced you need to pay for it. Service was friendly, but they brought the bill as soon as we got the food without being asked if we wanted anything else or if we wanted the bill. The food was good quality and well served."}
{"text":"Decent pancakes at some what inexpensive prices. Nothing too memorable and not really worth the 45 minute wait."}
{"text":"Butter has always been the breakfast spot and we enjoy the amazing pancakes.  Sadly was not the greatest experience. Today we Ordered food to go and it was ready within 15 minutes. Mind you this order was $40+. We were waiting for our coffee and smoothie. My husband simply asked the lady at the counter if they had a simple syrup they would throw in the coffee for him and she continues to point to the chocolate syrup. He was Trying to explain what simple syrup was and she as was still confused. The manager instantly storms out in a hostile manner without even being prompted by your confused staff and raises his voice in front of 15 + customers(families, children, elders) as my husband is Trying to explain the situation. He REFUSED to even listen and literally pushed my husband out of the door raising his first at my husband as well as making physical threats, including \"oh I would do something you wouldn't come back from\" My husband was even holding open the door for two woman entering who thanked my husband for holding to the door right in front of the manager. I even asked the girl if I had called her an idiot and because the manager was literally screaming, she looked completely terrified to even answer.   I have worked many years into the restaurant industry in management and I have NEVER seen a manager treat a customer in this matter.   Especially to do this on a Sunday the busiest time of day. I am a regular weekend patron that  attended with family and business associates. Before I called into the establishment I was meeting with associates of mine.   To be completely HUMILIATED, DISRESPECTED, and EMBARRASSED in front of such a wonderful establishment is just beyond my words .....   The manager also refused to give us his name or any other employee involved. This is the shittiest customer service. They lost a regularly customer because of a power hungry manger that wants to humiliate PAYING customers. Not one time does he give the common curtesy to listen to the other end of the sorry.    Absolute pathetic. He should be reprimanded for his actions or clearly retrained on how to deal with issues that arise that may have been mis understood or some general professionalism that he seems to be purely lacking . Just so disappointing that a place held to such high standard condones poor management.  We will NEVER Be returning."}
{"text":"Always great service and always great food.  My husband and I go at least one day over the weekend.  Scrambled eggs alone are the most fluffiest ever.  My husband has been getting the Mexican omelette and he says it gets better every time we go.  Oh and I love the coffee.  I just love this place."}
{"text":"Amazing as usual.  My only complaint is they changed their hash browns; a scalloped potato had now been replaced with  Dennys style potato. Not impressed.  It's still the best value breakfast around."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast spots I have found since moving to the valley. Very busy with some longer waits but there is reason for that, it's great!"}
{"text":"Visiting from LA, we were looking for a yummy breakfast and were not disappointed. Absolutely delicious! Friendly staff :)  Loved the cinnamon roll cakes (pancakes)"}
{"text":"It is a week later and I am still dreaming of their banana cream pie pancakes. It was that good.  We got seated right away and our drinks were brought promptly. I asked a couple questions about differences in meats (canadian bacon vs ham steak) and with my questions answered, ordered. Portion sizes were great. Kid meal options were great. Prices were reasonable. Every reason to return again and again except... I do not live in AZ. The HORROR!!!!"}
{"text":"Good but hardly great. And the booths for two people are way too small to enjoy a coffee, let alone a full breakfast."}
{"text":"Phenomenal! Worth the 4 hour flight plus 40 min wait haha Just looking at my pics makes me want some more of their food but I'm in California :( Can you please open a location in San Francisco?   I had the corned beef hash skillet which was to die for. And they are known for their pancakes so I just had to order their pancakes too. I got the Oreo pancakes and it was heaven! I forgot what hubby ordered but it was probably amazing too. If put money on it. I can't even describe their food, just an orgasm in my mouth! I highly recommend you go here.   Also, service was fast and great despite how busy it is here. Plenty of parking. Excellent experience!"}
{"text":"Great Breakfast. Quality food and beverages. Great service - given the number of customers that line up on the weekend. Anticipate an average wait time of 30 mins. Food is worth the wait. Once on the wait list, you will get queue tracking (on Yelp) that will help monitor your number on the list and time left - great convenience.  Don't miss the pancakes and OJ."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorite breakfast spots. I like to get there skillet and their pancakes are outstanding. Their syrup is wonderful. Their lattes are amazing. Just be prepared for a really long wait anytime before 1 PM. They close at 2pm.  Would go every morning if I could afford it and there wasn't always a line."}
{"text":"Butters is our Sunday brunch destination.   The food is always phenomenal.  We enjoy the skillets and power pancakes."}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast spots! Delicious food and great customer service. Great for families- but make sure you get there early on a weekend... It's packed!  Ps- the skillets are amazing!"}
{"text":"Busy busy place. Had a breakfast meeting with colleagues. A bit noisy for a meeting but overall a great place. Had an eggwhite omelet that was soo good. Our table covered a alll the bases with the usual breakfast items served quickly and efficiently.  This is a popular place and lines are not unusual but they seem to get everyone seated and served rather quickly.  Do go here. You will not regret it! Great for families and business folks alike!"}
{"text":"Great spot for breakfast and lunch! They were really crowded when we arrived with standing room only but they managed to seat us outside right away.  I've now been here about half a dozen times and I've always had a great experience. Gigantic omelettes and really good pancakes!"}
{"text":"We went here on a weekday and got seated right away. They have fresh squeezed orange juice that is ice cold and amazing. We had the hog skillet and the bagel sandwich. Service was excellent and food was delicious as well. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Love their basic breakfast! Scrambled Eggs & Hashbrowns w/a side of Pancakes.  I'm not a huge breakfast person, but this place knows how to do it right. Their potatoes are particularly delicious!!  There can sometimes be a wait so be sure to allow extra time to be seated."}
{"text":"Hands down consistently the best breakfast in Scottsdale. Incredible egg dishes, incredible pancakes, and incredible coffee. Wait times can be long so go there early, but definitely go there."}
{"text":"I love Butter's! I use to work in the offices right in the same complex as this restaurant. I would order take out or go eat lunch there. The omelets are to die for! The atmosphere is great too; very welcoming. If you haven't been here for breakfast, brunch, or lunch you need to go! You definitely won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Last Sunday was super packed but the employees worked fast to get us seated. The veggie skillet I ordered was delicious and I had the choice of choosing flavored pancakes (I choose berry and mascarpone). Service was prompt and the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is really good, hit hit all the points of a good breakfast restaurants, nice, clean, courteous staff AWESOME Food, we waited 12 minutes to ge seated, which is perfectly fine with me because the food is great."}
{"text":"We came here because of the Yelp reviews and OMG did Yelp ever deliver! We expected great food. We got it! We expected great service! We got it! We expected a quaint, well maintained space. We got it! We expected to be completely stuffed after having our meals. We are! We expected a long wait...well we got that too (although 30 minutes for a party of 5 isn't so bad) but it was worth it and I very much appreciated the use of technology that allowed us to track how many parties were ahead of us and how we were progressing on the waitlist. Overall a fabulous experience despite having consumed more calories than really made sense!"}
{"text":"4 words....fresh squeezed orange juice! This place is amazing. Food is delicious and I've never had a bad experience. Be warned that weekend mornings you might wait up to 30-40 mins but once in the food is fast and amazing! Definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"My boyfriend & I have breakfast here at least once a week & Butters is now our favorite spot. Our service from Madi is the best & our food is always hot & cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"Beautiful location. Love the setting. Outside seating with water fountain. One of my favorites dishes are the crepes. I like to order them with just plain fruit inside, a dash of powdered sugar and a bit of honey on top. Delicious. The pancakes are just perfect. The oatmeal is amazing as well. Very busy. Wait is about 20-30 minutes. Come early or late to avoid the rush."}
{"text":"First time here at this new place:  Been to he original butters & butterfields frequently, the new location is probably my new favorite! Conveniently close to home, I will surely return.  Was a slight wait, but that is alright for it being a popular place, service and food was extremely fast and great! I always go with a simple build your own omelette with hash browns and an iced coffee.   Thank you for building a new location, I'm sure the business will be great!   5/5"}
{"text":"We have eaten here before because of its closeness to family. The food has been OK but the servers have been relatively disinterested.  Father's Day was a disaster.  Though there were more than 5 tables available when we arrived, we were told until all of the party of 6 arrived we could not be seated. Over about 10 minutes we went from 1 to 4 to 5 and then finally to 6. When all of arrived, no tables had been left next to each other so that we could be seated though there were still 4 or 5 left open. Parties of 1 and 2 had come in and a few had left but at no time did the hostess and head hostess give consideration to the party of 6 building in the small entry area. We were ordered, not asked, to move to the corner and wait until we could be accommodated. When the failure to plan was pointed out, the head hostess reiterated that THEIR way of doing business was not to seat anyone until the whole party arrived. With that we took our business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience and the food was amazing.  New Mexico skillet is a must.  Don't get the toast, splurge and get the side of pancakes with the skillet."}
{"text":"Have been driving by for a long time and finally decided to give Butters a try.  Stopped in for an early breakfast one recent Saturday AM.  We were seated right away in a mostly empty dining room although by about 8am they were starting to fill up tables.  Our food was good, delivered fast and as ordered (well done).  I had scrambled eggs (fluffy!), sausage patties, hash browns & English muffin. My companion ordered a waffle and side of bacon.  There was enough food for at least 2 hungry people - took half home with me.  Our bill was around $25.  Server kept a good watch on us and returned for refills as appropriate.  I noticed they also serve FRESH squeezed oj with a machine up front (something to try on another visit!).  They have a lot of tables in their dining area and seem to be capable of seating a lot of guests in a rather small place.  The environment seemed rather fast-paced, not a place you would sit and linger long over a 2nd cup of coffee.  They also have a nice patio which I hope to try another time (weather did not permit during our visit).    I would definitely go back and maybe try lunch sometime."}
{"text":"Now I see why this place has 4.5 stars with 600 reviews. I don't know many other brunch places that can make ordinary skillets found everywhere into something extraordinary, and this place does it.  We got the California scramble with a side of chocolate chip pancakes and the New Mexico skillet with a side of regular pancakes topped with fresh strawberries.   The California scramble was a lighter take on a normal omelette, filled with grilled chicken, avocado, etc. It was fluffy and the chicken was moist! The New Mexico skillet was hefty, so do not get it if you're looking for something lighter. They gave a generous amount of chorizo and avocado. Both portions were good.   The pancakes were yummy! Their house made maple syrup was light but still flavorful compared to other places that taste thick and molasses-like.   The wait seems to go by pretty quickly, so don't get intimidated. It's big on the inside and can accommodate many customers at once for dine in. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite breakfast spots. The food is always delicious. Service is always fast and friendly. We like to ride our bikes so we can feel a little better about eating the amazing pancakes."}
{"text":"Glad I didn't heed to some of the silly comments and people penalizing the business for something beyond their control. Wait time was none for us, but of course that's the case when we visit on a Tuesday at 1pm. We ordered the Banana Cake and the Corn Beef skillet. The Banana Cake...how do they manage to keep that \"cake\" so fluffy and melt in your mouth? The skillet...well, I wish the harsh was a little more crunchy, but the flavour was working for me. The servers are definitely friendly and cheerful (I guess not having impatient customers breathing down your neck helps."}
{"text":"I came in here with my work team for breakfast. I had heard rave reviews so was super excited for this place. Unfortunately, nothing really impressed me. I was told by 2 people that the cinnamon roll pancakes were to die for, but when I got them, there was a tiny sliver of cinnamon and a slight drizzle of icing; where's the cinnamon roll component?!?! Barely existent. I also got an omelet which was decent, but nothing better than what I order at IHOP. Didn't live up to the hype for me."}
{"text":"A++ service  Best restaurant in America  Large portions  Great eggs pancakes and bacon  Often a wait but well worth it  Good gets out QUICKLY once seated  Like 5 minutes after ordering  Great breakfast place I go here when I visit Scottsdale during spring training  Highly recommended"}
{"text":"This place. What more do I say?  We were quoted 20-25 minutes to wait...we mosied on outside (pretty much zero space to wait inside) and sat on a lone bench...only to have our buzzer immediately go off. Kind of annoying, but I was just happy to get to brunchin'.  The space is clean and modern and just...not what I was expecting. I loved it. Tables were a little cramped but I can understand wanting to pack em in. If you build it, eaters will come!  Iced coffee was delish, and refills came without asking. I settled on a breakfast sammie of a soft, chewy bagel (hate when sandwich bagels are gigantic and hard. Not great when sandwich filling starts flying everywhere!) with over hard eggs, cheddar and I subbed avocado instead of bacon. TREAT CITY. My side of fruit was awesome as well: berries, pineapple, melly and oranges. It was a colorful, pretty accompaniment to my fat kid main dish.  Boyfriend got a MONSTROUS Mexicanish omelet filled with chorizo, jalapeño cheese (awesome that this is a choice for cheese), veggies and topped with a green chile sauce. Wonderment. Holy. I triied a bite (or 3. Or 4.) of his perfectly outside-crispy, inside-fluffy hash browns with the sauce and almost died.  Service was quick and friendly. I promptly went home and napped HARD. The sign of a glorious meal!"}
{"text":"A great place for breakfast well managed , great food choices.. Happy all the way around!!! A little pricey but so yummy !!!!!! Came back and this restaurant ,they still are the best breakfast in Arizona !!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went here with a few friends for brunch post hiking. Just had a 20 minute wait since we went late, but even that went by fast because it's spacious outside and the water fountain just makes the waiting easier. You can choose to wait inside too.   Food items: 1. Wildberry bliss French toast- We split this and it was delicious, everyone at the table loved it.   2. Garden Skillet- Can be made with your style, I got scrambled. It comes with toast or a pancake. I decided to get their specialty pancake for an extra $0.99 and choose the Oreo cookie s'mores, great decision, totally worth it. The skillet is served with a bed of hash brown potatoes which were soft but had crispy edges, basically perfect.  3. Freshly squeezed OJ- Other yelpers talked about it and glad I got it. I'm not even big on OJ.  Food was delicious, everybody was happy. Portions are big, at least for the girls at the table. Service was fast and friendly. Definitely would like to be back."}
{"text":"They do a nice job for breakfast. Pancakes and eggs are good. I like sitting outside on patio. It does get crowded, like most breakfast places, so go on weekdays if you can. We will go back."}
{"text":"This place is just pure awesomeness!! Absolutely delicious, I have been here a couple of times and I am never disappointed. I had the garden skillet and subbed French toast for pancakes. Food comes out fast, hot, and fresh, doesn't get any better than that. Eggs, potatoes, and French toast were all buttery goodness, hence the name. Anytime I'm in town I will make it a point to come here."}
{"text":"EVERYTHING IS GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOOD on purpose -  Not real sure what all the fuss is about this place.  It is an average place.  nothing stood out except that they purposely use genetically modified ingredients, they never use anything organic on purpose. everything you eat in here is genetically modified per the manager who does not believe in organic food...the orange juice is fresh squeezed so what we fresh squeeze our own o.j. daily and tastes the same as here...do not use the pancake syrup on the table it is not made by butters, per the waitress and the manager is it store bought with high fructose corn syrup and a little bit of maple then transferred into their own bottles...I did not like the fact if you want regular 100% maple syrup they will charge you $1.00 for it...which is unheard of...according to Chris the manager, if we gave away the really expensive healthy maple syrup they we would have to raise the prices...which is basically incorrect...I have never been in a restaurants which charge for pure maple syrup and the prices of other places are less expensive than butter's...The manager Chris needs help, his opinions about GMO being healthy and good for you are ignorant.. as well as him thinking they are too good to offer customers coupons...  We will not be back to this place, the food was just okay nothing fancy and certainly not healthy with all genetically modified ingredients..avoid"}
{"text":"Omelet was large & very tasty!  Chose pancakes as an option & grits...Very good.  It's a great place!"}
{"text":"On the way to the Barrett Jackson auto auction I yelped breakfast.  Right off the 101 I pulled in and the place was packed, good sign! We were seated before expected and as we browsed the menu an employee stacking chairs asked if we needed any assistance with the menu, to my surprise he was able to answer all of my questions and made note that he was the only restaurant that cracked their own eggs and his coffee was from a local coffee shop just down the street. No longer after we ordered, my coffee was topped off twice and the meal was on the table. The breakfast was excellent, service staff was very professional and efficient. All hand selected by the man stacking chairs.   On the bucket list for my next trip to Scottsdale AZ"}
{"text":"First time here and my husband and I both thoroughly enjoyed it.  We got the corned beef hash egg benedict, the banana creme pancakes, and the cappuccino.   The eggs on the benedict was cooked to perfection. Not too oozy... not overcooked... just right. The pancakes had the perfect amount of sweetness, and they were ohh soo fluffy! The cappuccino was... well.. a cappuccino. It went well with the pancakes to neutralize the sweetness. I don't know much about the tastes of cappuccinos, so I can't comment on how good it is compared to others... but it was decent to me.  We traveled 40 minutes just to try this place and we will be back."}
{"text":"I unfortunately had a terrible experience at Butters today. After calling ahead of time and receiving confirmation that dogs were allowed in the patio, I brought my small dog there for breakfast. I waited for 30 minutes for a table, only to be told by the hostess seating us that dogs were only allowed by the fence, information that I never received when I had called earlier. There were no other tables available. Then I asked to speak with the manager, since we didn't want to waste the trip and wanted to understand the situation. The manager was very defensive and unfriendly from the beginning of the conversation, and said that only service animals were allowed in the patio, also information that I did not receive over the phone when I first called. Also, there was another dog on the patio at the time that was clearly not a service animal. What happened today was very unfortunate. The food is decent, but service was clearly lacking."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken grilled chicken sandwich.  The sandwich was very good and so was the service.  The wait was about 20 minutes, but it was worth it.  My chicken sandwich had a delicious sauce on it that I loved.  This is a great place to eat for breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"I come here at least twice a week. Best breakfast I can honestly say I've ever had. They have the fluffiest eggs & they taste so amazing. The service is always great & the food comes out so quickly. There is usually a wait though because it's so popular but the wait is never usually long. I wish dogs were aloud on the patio but that is the only down fall."}
{"text":"OMG!!! First time here and it was a knockout. The food was great. I had the corned beef hash skillet and pecan pancakes. Good portions. Marisa our server gave us world class service! She brought drink refills without asking and offered a drink to go. Thanks, I will be back."}
{"text":"The food was good.  Very loud. They seated us right next to the opening to the kitchen. Would have left a better tip if we didn't have the banging of dishes right next to us."}
{"text":"Nice little neighborhood breakfast joint off via de ventura in scottsdale. They do have lunch also (suggestion: southwest veggie wrap with grilled chicken!) As far as breakfast goes, big portions, and very very fresh veggies and fruits. It gets packed in there though so get there early."}
{"text":"The best breakfast place around. Perfect pancakes. Enormous omelettes. Worth the wait on weekends. Be sure to ask for real Vermont maple syrup for the pancakes or French toast. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Love it!! Delicious!! My husband proposed at the fountain while we're waiting for a table. It's always busy so don't be in a hurry."}
{"text":"Ate here for breakfast today. The place was really busy. There was a 40 minute wait for breakfast on a Thursday. However, it was definitely worth the wait. Ordered the following:  - wild berry pancakes: so yummy and creamy with fresh strawberries, raspberries and blue berries on the side. Definitely recommend.  - Oreo s'mores pancakes: these were good but a little on the sweet side for me.  - Mexicana omelette: omg so yum. Ate the whole thing and I don't normally finish my food. Has chorizo, avocado, cheese, salsa verde, and onions.. delicious! Comes with fruit or hash browns on the side.  - kids Mickey pancakes: ordered for my kid with the chocolate chips. He loved it and he's a picky eater. Almost ate the whole thing. Also comes with one bacon or sausage.  - corn beef hash skillet: ordered by the hubs. He said it was alright. He normally finishes his food but he didn't this time.   All in all this place is bomb and totally worth it. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"This menu is loaded with great options and enjoy the friendly staff!  I will make this a breakfast destination of my local favorites!"}
{"text":"Always fantastic! Everything about this place makes it a great breakfast spot. Nice wide selection of breakfast foods.  Yes, as most reviews say, it gets ridiculously packed. We got there around 8:20 AM on a Sunday and still had to wait 10 minutes. I highly recommend getting there early if you don't want to wait. Otherwise, everything here is awesome!"}
{"text":"I love Butters! Great food! Everything I've ordered has been delicious but the chocolate chip pancakes are amazing as is the baked potato omelette. Yes; it is a long wait on the weekend but to me it's like \"Um duh; people go out to breakfast on the weekend! What do you expect?\" But I completely disagree with the people that say it's not worth the wait- IT IS; TRUST ME! This Scottsdale princess prone to extreme \"hanger\" (hunger induced anger if you aren't familiar with this term) would not wait for an hour on a Sunday if it wasn't worth it. Plus, once you're seated the service is actually super fast and they are good natured about customizing things which is good to know if you're picky like I can be. If you are a fan of breakfast you will be a fan of Butters."}
{"text":"Gave this restaurant another shot, and I'm sure my previous experience was an \"off-day\" for the staff.  Service was extremely attentive, and the food sublime.  I don't think my coffee cup ever reached lower than 1/2 before someone came by and filled it...and this was a busy Saturday morning.  Color me impressed!  We ate with another couple and everyone in our party of 4 thoroughly enjoyed their dish.  We even brought some home due to the large portions...hello delicious dinner!  A special thank you to management and staff for creating such a memorable breakfast."}
{"text":"Excellent manager and staff that was very helpful, friendly and efficient!  I would definitely recommend for a great brunch spot!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I'm not even a pancake girl but I like their pancakes a lot. They make scrambled eggs perfect and they also offer a chicken sausage which is perfect since I don't eat pork. Probably not my favorite hash browns or potatoes and a bit over priced but service is good and it's a solid breakfast. I've been a couple times now"}
{"text":"I guess I'm the 350th review. Yay me! 350 and a high rating is greatly warranted, from the delicious bottomless iced coffee and fresh cream they attentively bring you, followed by their take on eggs bennys that will leave you wanting a return, finalizing with the delicious array of dessert pancakes.. Heck, even the regular pancakes with butter and syrup deserve applause.  Super nice staff to boot."}
{"text":"The wait is long but the food is worth it. My favorites are the cheese grits and of course the fresh squeezed orange juice. It is like heaven In Your mouth. We always make a special trip out from California to Arizona and butters is a must on our menu."}
{"text":"You just have to try the Wildberey.   It's awesome.  They have it in pancakes, French toast or crepes.   Fantastic!"}
{"text":"Last day of vaca!  Glad I made this stop.  Pancakes are a real treat for me and they were delicious!!!  Service not top knotch but the cakes made up for it!"}
{"text":"Probably the best breakfast I have ever had.  They told me an hour and a half wait, took 25 minutes for my family of 12.  The food was an 11/10!  Best country Benedict ever!  Be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Butters and Butterfields are two restaurants owned by the same group with identical menus.  We ate at both and like Butters better.  Hey, everything's better with Butters (OK, I couldn't resist).  If you eat at Butterfields, you will really enjoy it, but you might feel like you can't believe it's not Butters (fine, I'm quitting now).  Seriously, the food is excellent, as is the service.  The menu is amazingly vast for a breakfast place.  Excellent food, excellent service, reasonable prices - what's not to like about that?"}
{"text":"The only reason it was a 4 star is because of the service. Maybe it was just an off day but I was not impressed - from the hostess, to our server and other servers bumping into us - I was wondering where all the high stars came from - until the food came that is... Now that was AMAZING!! From the French Toast, the the Egg Breakfast Bagel {DIVINE}, to the bacon!!  it all was amazing. And even more testament was my son eating his WHOLE PLATE OF FOOD!!! (He's 5 so this is a FEAT!) we will be back - just hoping for better service  To the owner/staff - Yes this place is hoping and I know you are busy but not acting \"too cool\" and taking time for your customers could go a LONG way!"}
{"text":"Yes! Yes! And Yes! What's not to love about breakfast food? Ordered the Santa Fe Scrambler with pancakes. Honestly, I loved the pancakes more than the scrambler. It left a lot to be desired. Lacked in flavor despite all its ingredients. That being said, because the menu is HUGE, I'm eager to get back so I can dive into the rest of it. Service and environment were top notch. My coffee cup was never empty. Will I return? Most definitely!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. Food is awesome and tasty. I got the Banana cream french toast with bacon and potatos. My friend had the Country Benny. The potatos were amazing!  Bacon i could taste the smoked applewood in it. French toast was good. I like the vibe of the place and the GF stuff they have! You probley wait longer to get in than you do to get your food. It was like i ordered and blinked and my food was done. Pretty awesome. The reason for my 2 stars is the young lady at the front was too busy talking to the shorter girl about her black long nails. That i stood at the front, right in front of her for awhile saying excuse me just so she could take my name down. After awhile she stopped and said, oh im sorry i just got my nails done i had to show her.  Alright... I asked her how long the wait was and she gave me an attitude saying she didnt know because she had to go look for someone, to ask when she comes back. Then,  just turned back around and kept talking about her nails. My waitress failed to bring me a refill after asking 4 times and still never got one, but she managed to bring the check. Thank god for the water on the table! So, this place is really good and deserves all the credit for their food. But my service today sucked. For a first timer, i may not be back only because of the service."}
{"text":"WOW!!! This place was amazing. I would definitely come back if I come through Arizona again.   PARKING: very ample lot  SERVICE: friendly and efficient, food came out in a decent amount of time  AMBIENCE: this place was packed of people of all ages! Really homey place and very fun. We had to wait about 40 minutes but there was a coffee shop next door we just waited in!  FOOD: I got the Wildberry French Toast (-$10) which was 2 pieces of brioche stuffed with marscapone and covered in a glaze and then served with strawberries, blueberries, and blackberries. Very sweet but good! I didn't like the glaze that much because somehow it tasted a little sour, but I thought the portion size was pretty generous (I was only able to eat about half).  My friend got the Mexican omelette which was really good, and my other friends got the garden scrambles over hash browns (delicious). I tried the protein pancakes which I enjoyed as well!  The bulk of the food was really tasty and I think if I came back I might opt for one of the banana French toasts just because the Wildberry one had this weird sour note to it. Overall though, very impressed :)"}
{"text":"I've been here with a friend a couple of times and both times were excellent. The food is wonderful and even though the second time we ate here there was a 15 minute wait, it was well worth it. I highly recommend the wildberry French toast, easily the best breakfast I've had at a restaurant. Their egg portions are huge, both of us had to split one side of eggs because it was so much (but trust me I'm not complaining). I'm not a huge fan of their hash browns but they were still better than most. Fantastic experience, I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Wait is pretty long but worth it I'd highly recommend you come with the entire family not the biggest place in the world but food is good and if you like smoothies strawberry cheesecake French toast this place is top notch definitely skip IHOP snowbirds flock to this place so be careful also during spring training all the baseball players go here"}
{"text":"My friend and I came here after a long hike and wanted a table outside. They told us it would be about 10-15 minutes but it was hardly five minutes, they were on top of it! We ordered the orange juice, and seriously, it is the BEST orange juice EVER! It is actually fresh  squeezed real orange juice and you can taste the difference. Delicious. I also ordered the gluten free pancakes and they were super yummy and light. Their omelettes and skillet plates are so good. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"By far the best breakfast I've had since I've moved back to Az. My daughter and I ordered a plate that came with pancakes, it was surprising to see fluffy pancakes topped with fresh fruit. I didn't even need syrup. I definitely would go back."}
{"text":"Loved the strawberry cheesecake stuffed French Toast & everything else I saw looked yummy too!"}
{"text":"Great food, Staff and management are alert and all about customer service which is so rare to find these days. Love their french toast and biscuits and gravy."}
{"text":"The eggs were amazing!!! Best scrambled eggs ever. They can make fresh orange juice, lattes, double espresso, what ever you want. Side note the gluten free pancakes are a bit dry so get some bananas or berries with them. The place is beautiful and clean. My waitress Desiree was a sweetheart and I can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"I tried this restaurant based on a friends recommendation.... Sad to say, I was disappointed. The service was terrible. Very slow and not attentive. The food was not terrible, but not anything special. The pancakes were pretty decent, but not good enough to come back for after my experience with service."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! I had the wildberry pancakes with eggs bacon and hash browns. Everything was cooked perfectly and my pancakes were delicious. We'll probably be back in the morning so I can try another flavor!!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast location service is good and employees are friendly. Try it if you are in the area"}
{"text":"An amazing breakfast experience! The Mexicana omelet, stuffed with chorizo and avocado, is to die for. The corned beef hash is excellent, but had too many potatoes and not enough hash. Coffee and service are outstanding too."}
{"text":"This might be my new favorite breakfast spot. Went here a couple weekends ago with some girlfriends and the food was bomb.com. I got the chorizo skillet and it was amazing. I wasn't even hungry and I ate the whole plate. (It's a problem, I know I need to work on not eating when I'm not hungry but food is so GOOD!)  The service was average - I can't think that anything was wrong. But even if it was bad, I'd go back. I def have to try some other things and I'm sure I'll update when appropriate. I've been craving that damn skillet since I've had it. Isn't it a little odd to crave chorizo and eggs? Idk. Seems a lil weird to me. But clearly it made an impression."}
{"text":"A very nice place for a great breakfast. Fast friendly and very professional service."}
{"text":"Gf n I stopped for brunch and we're delighted with quality and quantity of Butters offerings. A busy sunday family crowd and very bustling but we weren't picky about seating and got a table inside quickly. Huge portions and options for so many dishes we ended up ordering the kitchen sink too. Take home was inevitable. I'll b back"}
{"text":"I love to people watch and the manager is so involved every time I go here making sure everything taste amazing and we got everything we needed. Not to mention absolutely everything is so tasty."}
{"text":"Yes! Awesome place in Scottsdale. Generous portions and we were very full leaving. Good service and good management of waiting customers."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! Came in on a Sunday around noon - and got seated within 5 minutes! Service is great and food came out quickly.  My best friend and I are new to Arizona and we are impressed! We ordered the Whole Hog Skillet (added mushrooms) and the Wildberry Bliss Pancakes! We loved every bite!   Definitely recommend Butters!"}
{"text":"My son and I headed over here one morning for breakfast after scanning yelp for a nice breakfast and man was it worth the drive. I ordered pancakes with eggs and bacon and while my hot cakes and bacon was good my eggs were not, I sent them back and they were still wrong so I didn't even touch them.   My son ordered a waffle which he said was the best he's ever tasted which says a lot for this picky eater, he also ordered hashbrowns and was brought diced potatoes which he doesn't like so he picked over those. The place is very nice in a beautiful area and if I could give them a half start rating I would rate them as 3 1/2 based on my egg screw up but since I can't I'll give them a 3 and a promise to try them again.   The inside of the place was cold which made my pancakes get colder than normal room temp rates so I felt rushed to eat them but they were good so no complaints from me."}
{"text":"Of all meals, I am most experienced with breakfast.  Every weekend for several years now, I eat out for breakfast once a week.  Butters Pancakes & Cafe is the best I've ever tried. I ordered the California scramble which had chicken, bacon, avocado, tomatoes, and jack, and it was very good.  The hash browns were phenomenal and unlike I've experienced at other places.  It's almost like slight hash brown texture with a scallop potatoes underneath.  I also had the cinnamon streusel pancakes.  They were delicious.  It wasn't overdoing it with the cinnamon and frosting because only the top pancake had the added ingredients.  My dining companion had the veggie scramble and regular buttermilk pancakes, and she was impressed.  Their pancakes are very good.    It's in a nice plaza by McCormick Ranch.  Solid property.  You are missing out if you haven't been to this place.  I will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Orange juice was excellent.  Food bland.  Big puffy scrambled eggs that needed salt.  Left most on my plate.  I don't get it."}
{"text":"Butters, can you open a location in the Bay?  Far and away the best meal I had during my time in AZ.  My only criticism is that the corned beef hash seemed like it came out of a can. Still, the corned beef hash skillet was very good. Otherwise, highly recommend the wildberry pancakes, and I believe them when they say the OJ is specially-made."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love breakfast, we are big egg connoisseurs.  Decided to check out what all the hype is about at Butters.  Came here around 10am and it was already pretty packed.. wait time around 20 mins.  Not so bad compared to places in LA.  As we were seated I ordered the fresh squeezed orange juice, yum.  We debated away on the choices on their massive menu.  Our picks:  Whole hog skillet: one word... WOW! The hash browns were crunchy goodness with a buttery center and meats were good.  Topped with eggs made to your liking (I got a soft scramble).  One of the best breakfast skillets I have ever had!  2 egg breakfast with sausage & protein pancakes: My boyfriend got a more generic breakfast because he is watching what he eats.  He did mention the sausage patty was like McDonalds.. we all know Mcdonalds is not good for you but their breakfast sausage is amazing!  The eggs were cooked to his liking (over easy).  To his surprise he really liked the protein pancakes, syrup was not needed.    So far this place has blown my mind.. but we'll give it a few more tries and update this review :). But for now... we're coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Very impressed with Butters. Came here because of the reviews, And they were accurate. Service was excellent and staff was very attentive. Food was very good as well.  Certainly worth another visit in the future."}
{"text":"A great new breakfast joint to add to our rotation!  Because of our daughter's classes in Scottsdale, we started to look for breakfast places in the area to check out.  Of all of the breakfast spots that we have been to, I will have to say that Butters is probably the best of them all.  We've tried U.S. and Good Egg, Eggington's and others, and a lot of them are really good, but for simple melt in your mouth breakfast without any pretense, Butters takes the prize.  You get a huge amount of food for your money, and everything tastes great!  From the first bite of the hash browns, I could tell that this place was different.  They were substantially less greasy than the other places we have visited.  When the potatoes taste good enough plain that you _don't_need_ to add any salt, that's saying a lot!  From the potatoes to the pancakes and the french toast to the sausage, Butters is just. . .better.  Service is friendly.  The only challenge is getting a seat because this place is so popular, so be prepared to wait on Sunday mornings.  It's worth waiting for."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick bite to eat before we headed to the airport. Wow. Great food and service. Super quick. My son had the banana cream French toast and we had eggs Benedict Florentine which was super amazing   Thanks Ashly for the great service. Makes me wanna move back from Minneapolis just for those grits"}
{"text":"Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day. I came across this gem after a quick yelp scan of top-rated breakfast spots near our hotel. Butters caught my attention with it's vast menu and incredible looking omelets, pancakes, and more. After an early morning redeye and four hours of travel from Chitown I was famished.  There seemed to be a bustling crowd at this spot at nearly 8 am on a Friday! However, there was no wait for the al fresco dining option, which we gladly took. Upon being seated, we were immediately greeted. Our server was top-notch and helped me narrow down the immense menu.    I ordered the caramel macchiato and the chorizo omelet served with fresh fruit, and my choice of pancakes, cheesy grits, toast, english muffin, etc etc. I opted for the cheesy grits since my piggie of a fiance said he wanted to try them. The food came out so quickly, and it was made with super fresh ingredients. My chorizo omelet came smothered in jack cheese and green chile sauce. It had a little kick to it, but the cool and creamy avocados nestled inside were the perfect pair! The grits were smooth, cheesy and very flavorful!   I loved Butters and would recommend it to a hungry patron looking for quality food with a decent price tag!"}
{"text":"Food was as expected, didn't blow my mind but was very good. The pancakes were beautifully fluffy. My only complaint was the restaurant wasn't very busy as I went in early before the church rush came. I sat with my bible and was doing some studying throughout my meal, and was rushed the entire time. I get that turning tables effectively is a way for the waitress to make more money but I didn't even have time to breathe. I didn't feel I was being inconsiderate with my studying considering it was dead and way early in the morning. I was in and out in less than 35 minutes and felt unwanted. Great coffee and food but the waitresses don't have a great way to hide their obvious agendas."}
{"text":"My daughter came home for the weekend and we all wanted to go out for brunch. So what do you do? Of course, check out your Yelp bookmarks. I've had Butters bookmarked for awhile. So we decided to try.   We got there and had to wait for a good 15 minutes. Their indoor waiting area is really small but they do have an outdoor waiting area too. They give you one of those remote buzzers so that cool. Anyways, we got seated and got a booth by the window. It's a pretty big dining area that looks fairly modern for a breakfast joint. Nice and clean.   Our server greeted us right away and took our drink orders. Surprisingly, our drinks came fairly quickly.   I ordered the Whole Hog Skillet and an upgrade to one of their signature cakes. Got the Wildberry Bliss cakes. The Skillet came with hash brown potatoes, bacon, ham, & sausage with two scrambled eggs and jack & cheddar cheese. Oh my goodness, loved it. The hash browns were great. Loved how the potatoes are sliced thin and browned just enough to give it that crispness. It was really good. Enjoyed it a lot. I'm so glad I upgraded to the signature cakes. The Wildberry Bliss was so good. They give you two cakes and it has fresh berries with vanilla cream. Wasn't too sweet but really good. Didn't even need syrup. The fresh berries just topped it off. Really good  My daughter got the Eggs Verde that had corn tortillas on the bottom with black beans, eggs, jack cheese with green chile sauce smothering it. Came with their hash browns too. I snuck a bite and it was so good. My daughter loved it too. The green chile sauce had enough kick to it. This whole dish just somehow came together. Really good dish.  Then my wife ordered the eggs with chicken sausage and hash browns. She loved it. Said the eggs were so fluffy and she loved the chicken sausage. She was raving about her breakfast. She even said that this was probably one of the best breakfast she's had. That's pretty big compliment from her.   Anyways, service was excellent. Quick and efficient. Our server check on us and didn't have to fill our water cups cause they have a water jar so you can fill yourself. Really like that. She was busy but always kept track of us.   So we had a great breakfast here. Great food, great service. Nice atmosphere. Everyone at the other tables seem to enjoy themselves.  Do yourself a favor and try this place. I will be back and I have no problem ordering the same thing or something else. It's all good. Enjoy"}
{"text":"This has been our go to bk spot since moving to AZ. If I go during the week I tend to go early, early afternoon as it is not as busy as the \"breakfast\" rush time. I have yet to visit on the weekend but plan on doing that in the near future to get a gander of the best time to go.   Ok on to the food. I have to admit I get the sameeeee thing all the time! The bk 2 egg special with hash browns crispy (luv me some potatoes), bacon, and the wild-berry pancakes...slap your mamma good! Yup I said it...That is how good it is (hence why I get the same thing all the time). My kiddo tries different menu items and luvs it all. The staff is Wonderful...and they are always wonderful not just once or twice but ALL THE TIME. Service is on point, food comes out fast no matter how busy they are and the prices are very very reasonable for the amount of food you get.   Shout out to Dan and Chris (mgrs) they are always smiling and welcoming the guests as they arrive.They are both FAB!"}
{"text":"I love this place! We finally returned after waiting for the spring training visitors to leave, and while there was still a wait it was a short 15 minute wait time for the 2 of us.  The hostesses do a great job and always have it together. They're always courteous, and just like everyone else there they work hard. We sat inside as it was first available, which was more than fine. The inside was full, however it wasn't extremely loud like some places get. We always get our food right away and always without mistakes.  I got the Santa fe scrammle which is always good. The serving size says two eggs but it's a huge portion! I like Butter's giving you the choice of fruit, grits, or hash browns, while still giving you the  next choice of pancakes or toast. (when you get an omelette or scrambler) I also added zucchini and peppers to my dish and it was only a $0.25 up charge for each.   My bf got the two eggs, with fruit and bacon as a protein. he also got a short stack of blueberry pancakes. The pieces of bacon are a good size,eggs were scrambled perfectly, and he loves the pancakes every time.  The prices are very reasonable and the servers and bus staff are very attentive.   Thank you Butter's staff so much for letting me wake up and know I have a place for breakfast I can go that won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Such good breakfast.  Love the pancakes - so much selection and quality.  Good cost to portion ratio."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere . Food was outstanding ! Waitstaff was attentive and I didn't get hit on not even once! A must stop if your in the area for breakfast. Do it......do it.......do it."}
{"text":"Visiting from Las Vegas and found this gem on yelp!  Get there early or go enjoy a manicure next door while you wait, we waited 25 min but well worth the wait. Ordered the corned beef hash skillet with pancakes and the California omelet. Per the waitresses recommendations, she was right. They are very busy and tight seating unless your in a booth, but I enjoy these atmospheres. I also ordered the americano, it wasn't my favorite. The service was amazing and great food!"}
{"text":"I'm a simple breakfast person but this place is great. Whatever you like...pancakes, eggs, omelettes even there lunch menu is really good. Check it out."}
{"text":"First time dining at this establishment. Food is excellent. It was a bit of a wait which I chalked up to the excellent food comment."}
{"text":"The New Mexico skillet with poached eggs was delicious! As well as the banana cream cakes, just the right amount of sweet. My husband had the cinnamon roll cakes and they were phenomenal as well! Service was great and overall just a great breakfast experience."}
{"text":"Lovely location. Food was so fresh and presented nicely and the staff was most accommodating. I highly recommend Butters! Our first time there and we will return."}
{"text":"I have been to Butters twice, and thought it was great both times! I have been for lunch, and had the turkey burger with sweet potatoes fries, and for breakfast, where I had an omelette and pancakes. Both meals were really tasty. The prices are also very reasonable and the service wasn't great, but wasn't awful. The patio seating was great on the morning that I went."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge brunch person, unless a cocktail and a trendy atmosphere is involved which is not the case at Butters.  It's better than a Denny's but not what you'll find if you were to get brunch in Old Down Scottsdale or downtown Phoenix.  My food here yesterday was decent.  I like pipping hot food and luke warm is not okay with me.  I was on a date so I didn't want to complain but if it would have been a different situation, then I would have asked for a hotter meal.  Service was quick and almost too quick.  I think the most disappointing aspect of yesterday was that our bill was brought to the table before we were even half way through our meal.  It made it awkward and I even said to the girl, we're not quite yet done.  She replied with no rush.  Next thing you know wallets being opened and we still had awhile to spend there so that was frustrating.  I did enjoy the potatoes, it was just the eggs that were luke warm but the meal was decent.  The coffee was good and refills were quick.  Staff are friendly, place is clean and service is quick."}
{"text":"We are breakfast SNOBS and Butter's was beyond our expectations!  Seating on a Sunday morning was about 20 mins and worth the wait. Menu is diverse, something for everyone. Eggs were so fluffy and amazing! We tried pretty much everything on the menu: skillet was fresh ingredients with eggs your way, egg whites just as fluffy, waffle (crunchy on outside), biscuits and gravy was perfection. Hash browns are different than anything we've tasted. Fresh OJ and Grapefrut juice. Our server Regina was so nice!  Exceptional in every way. Go here!!!"}
{"text":"This place is hands down one of the best breakfast places I've been to in months. Two of my friends and I sat down for breakfast ordering,  crepes, eggs benedict, and a corn beef hash skillet. Everything was good if not great.   In short; eat here. There may be a bit of a wait and an above average amount of noise, but you're sure to be satisfied!"}
{"text":"This place was seriously awesome.  I went on recommendation of Dbacks pitcher.  Wait to be seated less than 20 minutes.  Lots of choices on menu from pancakes and crepes to omelets, skillets and benedicts. I had a banana crepe with a pecan caramel sauce.  So good.  Coffee was good too.  Would go again."}
{"text":"Starting experience was not good but a smart manager figured out how to take a bad situation and turn it around. Kudos ! As for the food and service always great."}
{"text":"I'm from out of town and my hotel concierge said Butter's was THE breakfast spot in the area. My family and I arrived around 830am on a Saturday and had to wait 30 minutes for a table (5 in our party). The OJ was really good- very fresh and tasted like an actual orange. I ordered a Veggie Omelet which was really fluffy. My omelet came with a side of pancakes. I thought they were pretty overrated. Not too sure what the hype is about them. Good breakfast, but nothing special to me."}
{"text":"I typically eat pretty healthy but this was a great experience for pure indulgence! I had chocolate chip pancakes, sausage and eggs. Everything is very 'fluffy', the waiter mentioned they add butter into the eggs to create that texture. Coffee was eh. Overall great experience and nice service."}
{"text":"I am from Seattle, and came here based on the good reviews. Let me just say that I was not disappointed. I had the Mexican omelette , with hash browns, two buttermilk pancakes, and the fresh squeezed orange juice. The portions were good, the  omelette was tasty, the hash browns were cooked to perfection with some crunch, and the pancakes....... let's just say I now know why they are \"known\" for their pancakes. The next time I go, I will skip the coffee for another glass of the OJ.  I will end this by adding that the service was fast, friendly, and very attentive."}
{"text":"I love this place because of the portions! You get a pancake with every meal and to upgrade the pancake is very cheap! The food is average but the pancakes make you come back for more!!!"}
{"text":"This is an awesome spot for Breakfast or Brunch. The menu is pretty extensive. There are all sorts of varieties and things you can get.  I got a skillet which had some meats, two eggs and potatoes and it was awesome. I also got some pancakes on the side and they were absolutely incredible.   We were sat quickly, the service was attentive without being over bearing and everyone was polite and pleasant.  The only issue we had was finding this place. I had never been here before and all the building around are pretty uniform. The signage definitely doesn't stand out so make sure you are paying attention when you are looking for it.   Easy 5 out of 5. Will be back."}
{"text":"Everyone's food was excellent.  Pancakes were delicious.  Service was a little spotty, be prepared to wait.  Highly recommend the Mexicana omelette, one of the best egg dishes I ever ate.  KT"}
{"text":"This place is awesome and worth the wait. My favorites are the strawberry pancakes, garden skillet, and breakfast burrito. They also offer fresh squeezed OJ which is really amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Now I see why they have 140 reviews not recommended.. Im not smart shouldve read them and went to Ihop for crying out loud.. At least they follow instruction.."}
{"text":"Really good place to get breakfast in Central Scottsdale.   Their salmon/cream cheese scramble is delicious as well as their eggs/bacon/hashbrowns/pancake breakfast.  Both are around the 9-10 dollar range.  Recommend trying their fresh squeezed OJ.  Would have been a five star review, but downgraded a bit since I've two times I've been there the hash browns have been lukewarm."}
{"text":"I love this place! During our first trip to Arizona, we were recommended to try this awesome place by the hotel staff. I am forever grateful for that recommendation! My favorites are the pancakes, cheesy grits, and fresh orange juice. Highly recommend to try this place out!"}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  Great, solid breakfast.  Especially in comparison to the breakfast we had at TC Eggington's yesterday.  (See review if you want.)  We both got 2-egg breakfasts with hashbrowns and pancakes, I also ordered bacon.  For an extra $1, you can upgrade to their premium pancakes, which we did.  Blueberry and banana cream.  Bacon was quite good.  Thick cut but still had some crisp edges.  Eggs were fine.  My wife ordered hers hard scrambled for the first time in a long time and regretted it.  Says she should have stuck to over-hard.  The hashbrowns were not shredded potato, but more like slivered potato.  There were crispy, browned bits which I appreciated, but I'm still ambivalent towards them.  Doctored them with Cholula hot sauce and they were fine.  The pancakes weren't necessarily the star, but were a very good addition.  Fluffy but still had some chew to them.  Didn't disintegrate upon spreading butter over them or pouring over the syrup.  They have sugar-water for syrup on the table, you can buy real Vermont maple syrup for $1.25.  This is a little steep but worth the purchase compared to the cheap stuff on the table.  My banana cream pancake was not overly sweet with some good cinnamon flavor coming through the cinnamon crumbles, the bananas were soft and sweet and the cream negated the need for syrup.  My wife enjoyed her blueberry pancakes - which were both in the pancake and a good number off to the side.  She said nit the best pancakes she has ever had, but pretty darn good.  The coffee is decent too.  Nothing special, just decent.  So for a superior breakfast, we spent less here than we did yesterday at TC Eggington's - and that was WITH upgrades - so the value is also pretty good here.  We would definitely come back here.."}
{"text":"Such delicious food! I was impressed with the flavors of the banana cream pancakes...seriously SO good!! Not too sweet, which is what I was worried about.   Also had the HMOP Skillet (ham, mushrooms, peppers, onions) also, which was really good, with scrambled eggs. The fresh squeezed orange juice is delicious too.   My only complaint would be the server. Not super attentive (at all) and seemed a little rude almost."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal here. It's one of the best breakfast places that I've ever been to in the history of ever. I love how they have fresh squeezed grapefruit juice. I don't normally like grits but I could have an entire meal of their cheese grits alone. They have run out of their cheese grits a few times I have been there on a weekend, and I have almost cried (true story). The Sante Fe scrambler is my go to dish here!"}
{"text":"Best omelet I've had in a while. Was satisfied with the hash browns and pancakes as well.  Friendly staff. Great ambiance and music. Overall a place to come back too. Lastly, good coffee too.   #foodcoma #atesomuch"}
{"text":"Delicious. Can't stop talking about how good my breakfast was after I left!!! Would totally come back if I was ever back in Scottsdale. I got the Banana Nut French Toast and their fresh squeezed OJ!!"}
{"text":"The food is absolutely DELICIOUS and at a very affordable price. The pancakes were amazing - we had both the regular and protein pancakes. Lots of healthy options as well! Eggs/omelette were fluffy and not too greasy. Definitely recommend the hash browns as well! One of the best breakfast spots in the area. Get here early though on weekends the line gets long at peak times!"}
{"text":"Very cute family owned restaurant! Manager chris was fantastic and it's very clear that he cares about this business and its customers. You know it's a good place when they allow an adult to eat from the kids menu as requested. I hate when restaurants tell me no because I'm not under 12. If I want a kid sized portion and you make it in your kitchen then why not! Luckily Chris allowed it, with a smile. And that made my day. The restaurant is modern and clean, well staffed and very fast! 4 minutes from order to food to be exact. All hot and fresh :) thanks !"}
{"text":"I don't know where to start, I honestly feel all their reviews are fake. Let's start with the service, the wait staff did smile once as if they're miserable and unhappy to be there.   Their dinning area is very cramped, which makes extremely loud and hard to even hold a conversation. The food, the eggs seems processed and similar to Denny's. The pancakes also lacked authenticity and tasted very processed. The bananas on the pancakes and their bacon is all that tasted freshly made.   Along with the unhappy wait staff, the proceeded food, they have an unusual fly issue in their indoor dinning area. I literally couldn't go 20 seconds without swatting them away, I even killed one at my table leaving it as a souvenir for the bus staff.   Overall I wouldn't recommend this breakfast spot to anyone looking for authentic home style cooking experience."}
{"text":"This is a great new breakfast lunch restaurant that opened a few months ago.  The owners also own Butterfield's on Scottsdale & Shea.   The service was fast, food was delicious and the place looks great!"}
{"text":"Delish!  Coffee, fresh squeezed orange juice, pancakes, French toast, eggs & bacon - check, check & check!  All were amazing and fresh.  Prices were really reasonable especially for the freshness and quality.  It was worth the drive from N. Phx - will go again as soon as we can, so many things I'm dying to try!"}
{"text":"I loved this place! To start off the Fri is were amazing. The smoothies and coffee I tried were really good. The best part were the pancakes. They were honestly so delicious and filling. Definitely recommend this place and will be going again for sure."}
{"text":"Great service and wonderful breakfast ! We split your cinnamon pancakes and eggs benedict. What a great combo!   There was a wait but worth it! We have impeccable service! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Stopped at Butters for breakfast on our way back from hiking on Saturday. We were told the wait would be 20 min for 2. Once we were seated (in under 20 min, btw), our server came over & took our drink order. She returned w/2 hot teas and a small fresh OJ (based on other reviews, I HAD to try it) in a flash and asked if we needed more time to look over the menu. We said we did & she left. She returned 2 more times within about 5 min to take our order. Seemed a bit much, but as we sat through our meal & sipped on our tea afterwards, it started to make sense...  After we ordered (we shared the Classic Brioche Toast w/glazed cinnamon apples, side of scrambled eggs & bacon), our food was brought out in about 6 minutes. Even though our order wasn't terribly complicated, I was both impressed and intrigued. The food was delicious and the fresh OJ was amazing, by the way.  I looked around and took notice that the place was packed (the inside dining only; no one dared sit on the patio as it was a grey, chilly day), they had a full wait area, yet they were still able to churn customers out at an impressive pace. People placed their orders and received their meals in under 10 minutes. I actually watched 3 tables that ordered at the same time & they all got their food in about 7 minutes. I was amazed! Not only is their waitstaff friendly & efficient, but that kitchen staff is clearly a well-oiled machine!   Customers seemed to clear out as soon as they paid their check, so I think it was a little strange to the staff that we were still sitting well after our plates were cleared. Maybe the quick pace of the restaurant makes customers feel like they can't sit & relax after their meal? Something to think about, Butters :)  I'd definitely return and recommend!"}
{"text":"I Have not had breakfast here that was not fabulous. Can get busy of course. And secret little tip...  ask to sit with Willly!  This gentleman is the most friendly and professional server I have found in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Went here with a coworker during the week for the first time and was impressed. They had a very good menu selection With lots of breakfast items to choose from as well as salads and sandwiches. It was hard making a decision but I settled on the classic eggs Benedict and added fresh avocado. While it wasn't the all time best eggs Benedict I've ever had, it was pretty darn good and I would definitely order it again! I also like my hashbrowns a little crispy and these were perfect! I will definitely come back here and try some other items on the menu since so many of them sounded so good!"}
{"text":"A short wait on a weekday morning but the process was via cell phone so well organized. I had the wild berry pancakes and my husband had strawberry waffles. Everything was good and the service was prompt. Kiddo had the silver dollar pancakes which were perfect for his little hands. Overall good visit."}
{"text":"Great New Mexico skillet item on menu with pancakes on the side. Reasonable pricing and good service. Good place for brunch in Scottsdale. I definitely recommend going."}
{"text":"Spent a week in Scottsdale with the fellas for NCAA tournament and Cubs spring training games. Had breakfast at a different place each morning. Butters was absolutely the best breakfast I had there. One of the best breakfast places I've ever been to. Everything was fresh and hot. Each guy had something different and also praised the food. Quick service and reasonably priced. It's worth the wait in line. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"I have been going to Butters for years.  When they opened another restaurant about 2 miles down the street from me, I got on my knees to thank G-d that are now that close.  The scrambled eggs, seriously, is a religious experience and something of a national secret to them.  They are fluffy, not \"eggy\" tasting and wonderful.  I am sorry to report, however, that once I discovered their eggs, I really have not ordered anything else.  The service and staff have always, without exception, been first rate.  Your coffee mug, no matter how busy they are, will never get below half a mug.  The staff almost always have smiles.  Its really just a wonderful experience to be there.  I have talked to the owner about being buried there.  We are still under discussion.  :)"}
{"text":"I'm so glad my family and I stopped in here on vacation ! The eggs Benedict and pancakes where awesome . Best breakfast place I've ever eaten at . Also the orange juice was fresh squeezed (the best ) I definitely would love to come back here and would recommend you stopping by you won't be disappointed !"}
{"text":"Wow! From Los Angeles, I have to say I have high expectations. This is one of the best breakfast spots. Not expensive, friendly, and the food it great!   Eggs are fantastic. I'm a big foody and the Protien pancakes ( I got the almonds and oats on the side) were delicious.   Everyone that works there is so nice, Antonio we love u! The manager was so friendly and that was the cherry on top of the amazing breakfast we just had!   HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! A must!!"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely fabulous. If you like cornbeef hash, theirs is homemade and delicious! Thank you to the waitress for being so helpful and for the recommendations! My son and I went for breakfast,  trying 'new to us' places. We loved the atmosphere and location. Will definitely be back to try lunch and other breakfast items!"}
{"text":"Butters/Butterfield's are all great breakfast/brunch places! We have visited all 3 locations and get consistently good food and service.   The pancakes are delicious. They're light and fluffy and taste great plain or with their special toppings. Their waffles are also delicious and crispy.  But our favorites are the various eggs benedict (the country being one of our favorites) and the skillets!    Everything is well portioned.  This place is popular and does tend to get busy, so come early or be prepared to wait a bit."}
{"text":"The fresh squeezed OJ is one of the best things I've ever drank!!!!!  My husband and I shared the mexican omelet and banana pancakes. Plenty of food. It was outstanding!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Other than the tables being far too packed and close to each other, the food here is top notch outstanding! Next time we will sit outside, indoors is way too crowded in terms of sitting too close to your neighbor. Great food!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my breakfast here this morning. I had the protein pancakes. They were delicious. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great coffee, healthy and delicious choices, as well as breakfast favorites, totally going back."}
{"text":"It was a good place for breakfast. Very cute inside and food was really really good. It was a 20 minute wait for 2 of us."}
{"text":"Great service, even on a busy morning! The staff was very friendly. Denver omelet and Eggs Benedict were delicious!! We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Butters - Great food, great service and great value! Butters is consistently good as their sister restaurant Butterfields. The staff is friendly, and I've never been disappointed. Fresh squeezed OJ is a plus! I personally like the Santa Fe scramble with chorizo, red jalapenos & cheese."}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant in the Phoenix area! Victoria was the very best hostess ever! Antonio is a great manager! The food is outstanding. This local will be frequenting Butter's regularly. We had bacon and eggs, with crepes and a waffle. Coffee is Passport! Better than any Starbucks! Try it out, you will not be sorry!! Northsight and Raintree in Scottsdale, next to Jackson's Car Wash."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful little breakfast spot - a huge improvement after the last place that was here (le peep). Food is high quality and a good value, plus the staff are really on their toes. I thoroughly enjoyed my country-style eggs benedict."}
{"text":"Food was great, but we were rushed through our entire meal.  They were very busy and  obviously wanted us out as quickly as possible. They kept trying to take our plates despite the fact that we were still eating.  At one point the waitress took an entire plate of pancakes we had only taken one bite of.  We tried to talk to the manager since our food was picked up and we weren't finished with it.  He was extremely rude. We won't be eating here again!"}
{"text":"Wow; we did not come close to the experience you would expect from the stars given to this place. Service was friendly and fast. Dining area is cramped and non-inviting in general, but clean. Eggs were over-easy and cooked to perfection. The grits had some weird cream on them. Odd, grits should be left alone. Pancakes were fluffy but not much flavor or texture. Honestly, just a mass-produced pancake with no \"specialness\" about it\". Corned beef hash that Mr. Muscle ordered was not homemade, pretty standard there too. And the hash brown (like 99% of all hash browns) are not cooked long enough or crispy enough. Its a solid breakfast at $17.00; but we were really expecting a different kind of WOW factor. Don't go out of your way, that is my advise."}
{"text":"Butters Pancakes? Instantly, I pulled up my Cardiologist's phone number just in case! Now this was a classic bookmarked place on Yelp that I finally got around to visiting. We had a slight wait of 15 minutes, which isn't bad at all with the amount of people waiting. Things I loved:  1. Orange Juice - Very fresh and would be even better with some Kettle One 2. Food - Had the breakfast burrito w/ chorizo (checked again to make sure my doc was on speed dial) Very good with the somewhat crispy butter potato hashbrowns.  3. Service - This place would have totally gotten 5 stars if it wasn't for the odd service. One of the people we went with received his order, but there was an extra egg (he didn't even notice until she came over). She had the cojones to take his plate away well after he started eating because it was meant for another table. She didn't apologize and actually made him feel like it was his fault. He stopped her saying he had already started eating and it was too late. Very odd to say the least.  Overall, we had a good experience and will possibly try it again when we're in the area. Maybe sneak in some Kettle One! Shit, why do I always show my hand! Catholic guilt."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Omelette was fluffy and yum! Comes with a pancake and the best hash browns I've tasted! Portions are definitely big enough for two!   Ps. GET THE FRESHLY SQUEEZED OJ!!"}
{"text":"Oh thank God another great breakfast spot even closer to home. I saw that this place was new and was excited to try it. We went on a weekend and it was really crowded but the wait was maybe 15 minutes and well worth it. I'm not one for getting crazy with breakfast meaning I like to stick to the classic bacon, eggs, hash browns and toast. Keep it simple I say. I wasn't disappointed. The bacon delicious. My scrambled eggs cooked perfectly. My partner had to send the over easy eggs back once because they were over done but corrected. Hash browns perfect and the toast very good. Lots of space here and I love that. Some breakfast spots tend to be small and cramped. Love it and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The breakfast was excellent.  I had the a traditional egg and bacon breakfast but there were so many other choices. I definitely recommend this place if you've never been. Fast service. Go early."}
{"text":"So we ordered french toast along with our mexican omelette. Omelette was very good. French toast was awful, like it was not dipped well, and came out very hard. I reported to the server, but server said\" I am sorry we cannot comp it just because you ate 1/8 of one of the slices\" Hello, this is 6.95! It is not 69.95! I work in a restaurant industry and nice gesture of \"we can take it out of your bill would be nice\" or even a sorry would be good enough! How will I know if the toast was hard if I did not actually put it in my mouth? It was one small bite. The server was not nice at all. I am an avid goer of Butterfields which is their sister company- they are always nice! but Butters has no customer care at all! Not to mention the 1 hour wait!"}
{"text":"Amazing pancakes and French Toast. The pancake batter is delicious. Cafe mocha, Oreo and Berry flavors are must get. They also have squeeze their orange juice when you order. Service is great as is the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Breakfast regular here, glad to have a super consistent spot for quality breakfast / brunch. Try the Protein pancakes with real Vermont syrup, fresh OJ or a latte made in the entrance. You will want to be indoors due to the loud intersection, and parking can be a stretch, but this relative to the Butterfield's Location definitely does it justice.  Recommended for breakfast before 11am - 4.0 Stars"}
{"text":"Mmmmmmmm do not skip ordering the pancakes! They may have been the best I've ever eaten!  Had the New Mexico skillet? I think it was called that   Chorizo.. Eggs.. Avacado  , delicious!  Everyone at the table was pleased    Heard the OJ was amazing but i did not try it .  Had to wait about 15 mins for a table   No big deal   Small place  pretty packed   Now i see why! Food was worth the wait! Dont save your money and go to Denny's like the person reviewed before me"}
{"text":"We love this place!!!! Always busy with a line. Dutch pancake is fantastic. Friendly fast service, good quality, and large portions."}
{"text":"Today was my first visit. My over-easy eggs were perfect. The whites were white; no cooked brown spots. The hash browns are slices not shreds. YUMMY! Every bite I had off of others plates were amazing. I'm gonna be back. I need to try the French toast."}
{"text":"Yummy breakfast.    Corned beef hash benedict: fresh Mexicana Omelette:  Good but wish the chili sauce had a little more oomph and I wish it has a little more cheese Wild berry pancakes:  Delicous  The service was prompt.  If I lived in Scottsdale I would definitely be back here."}
{"text":"I love going there.. have been there few times, and not once I went without having to wait for at least half an hour.. they don't take reservations, so make sure you're ready to wait between half an hour to an hour! It's totally worth it though, and their pancakes are so good, they just melt in your mouth! Omelets and skillets are my go to whenever I'm there.. if you're around that area, it's worth checking out. It's also very family friendly as I see so many families or a big group of people waiting together outside!"}
{"text":"Being that I'm pregnant, I'm obsessed with their orange juice! I love going there for my breakfast and their pancakes are just delicious!!!  Their prices could be a little better but the food totally makes up for it!"}
{"text":"Standard breakfast and huge menu with nothing amazing on it.  This is a standard breakfast with a high price tag. Love the area though."}
{"text":"The wildberry pancakes were DELICIOUS!!! The vanilla mascarpone was the best part! So much good food at a very good price. Definitely will be returning!!!"}
{"text":"Read about this place on yelp and decided to take the family for breakfast. I got the cinnamon roll pancakes and they didn't disappoint. Also had scrambled eggs that were fluffy and delicious. The hash browns were cooked to perfection. The coffee was just as good as Starbucks. The kids loved their pancakes and French toast. Wish this place had a location closer to where we live cause I'd be eating there everyday!"}
{"text":"This is a great breakfast place.  Delicious food and excellent service.  Although this outpost has only recently opened they are a \"well oiled machine\"... no kinks in the system.  Lots of good gluten free options."}
{"text":"Most fluffy eggs I have ever eaten.  They have a alot of gluten free choices.  Really good breakfast/brunch food."}
{"text":"We are visiting from New Jersey and stopped for breakfast here. From being greeted and seated, the staff was more than helpful and courteous. We also had an 18 month old with us and special attention was given to him. I would recommend this restaurant highly. The food was excellent also. Our waitress Kristine could not have been nicer"}
{"text":"Great food, greater service. My husband and I went to Butters while on a business trip.  I read about the place on Yelp.  The crepes were fantastic and so was the scrambler. We enjoyed our breakfast so much, thanks especially to our very sweet waitress, Lauren, we came back the second day and again had the pleasure to be seated in the same booth with the same server.  She is absolutely a delight.  My husband really loved the chorizo scrambler and I loved the crepes and the grits.  The orange juice is wonderful and so is the coffee.  We will definitely come back on our next trip to Scottsdale.  Thank you Butters and thanks Lauren!!!!"}
{"text":"We came in Saturday morning. We had to wait for about 30 minutes. We didnt mind waiting outside because there was nice cool weather and we sat by the fountain outside. They conveniently text you once it's your turn in line.  We ordered a hog skillet and upgraded the pancakes for $1.50 to wild berry bliss pancakes. I ordered a classic eggs benedict and shared. The hog skillet had bacon and potatoes and eggs. The food was plain and it tasted like something you could make at home but it wasn't too greasy.  My wild berry bliss pancakes  looked picture perfect the  pancake itself was lacking. The marscapone cheese was a nice touch I did enjoy the fresh berries. The egg benedict was unmemorable and usually it is my favorite. I didn't care for the hashbrown which were sliced and fried like scalloped potatoes.   Verdict: This was a drive for us the patio seating was nice but there's better breakfast places out there."}
{"text":"Absolutely delish!  Everything we ordered from the french toast to eggs benedict was so good!  Service was wonderful too!"}
{"text":"Gluten free pancakes and Belgian waffles = amazing! I ordered the GF waffle and by boyfriend ordered the New Mexico skillet & was able to get GF pancakes with that. We split everything & it was all delicious! We both loved the skillet a lot. The pancakes & waffle were great also. We got there around 9am on a Tuesday morning in March (Spring Training time) and it was pretty packed, but we were seated right away. It's a popular spot though. And you might get lucky (like we did) and see some famous baseball players/managers eating here as well. We'll definitely come back here when we visit again."}
{"text":"Wow delicious. Get the berry pancakes they're delicious. And the omelet nice and fluffy. The service was wonderful too."}
{"text":"We had a party of 5 and everyone really enjoyed what they ordered. We would have given it 6 stars if we could. Excellent Eggs Benedict."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place, but the server had such a chip on her shoulder. In addition to arguing with me about how they wouldn't be able to cook my egg whites over hard  (\"I'll have to ask the manager if that can be done,\") she walked around with such a smug and unhappy look.  But the restaurant itself is very nice. Clean, comfortable, and I like that a carafe of ice water is on every table. The wild berry crepe and egg whites over hard (yes, it could be done) were excellent.  Bad taste in my mouth and probably wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Alex, a phenomenal lady waited on us this morning!  Talk about a sweetheart that is \"on-the-ball\"! Alex did not miss a beat! The food was outstanding, and came out quickly.  Your manager stopped by after I asked for a comment card, as you were out of them. We are members of the Butter's Club too. One suggestion, and that being that the tables are really crammed together. This makes it tight, and uncomfortable. If you were to take one table out of each row, it would make it much more enjoyable experience. (Constructive criticism). We have alot of restaurant experience. Butterfield's, on the other hand, did not feel so cramped and tight. Much more open. Thank you  Mike and Jan  Phoenix"}
{"text":"Loved this very clean restaurant & fast, friendly service.   Had florentine eggs Benedict; spinach, egg & muffin perfect, but sauce a bit bland, but maybe that's just my taste - freshness & presentation were perfect. That sauce is the only reason for the 4 stars.   I'm eager to go back again & try more stuff - so much looks good!"}
{"text":"Delicious!! I enjoyed the Irish Benedict and my girl enjoyed the Whole Hog Skillet. You won't be disappointed! Definitely get some pancakes! They were a standout! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"We had Saturday planned to have breakfast at Butters and a desperately needed massage at a reflexology spot for a relaxing weekend.  I was ready an hour before and my wife not so much. Ended up leaving for Butters at 9:30 our massage is at 10:30. Long story short they got us seated in 13 minutes and served by 9:57.  Place was packed! The food is incredible and the service impeccable. Kudos to our waiter.  We will definitely be back.  Made it to the massage on time.  Butters turned a bad start for the day into a plus!  Well done!"}
{"text":"There really isn't much you can screw up about breakfast if you use fresh food and know how to cook an egg and Butters  does.  They have good fresh food, Delish freshly squeezed oj. Good grits made with cream. A few out of the ordinary menu choices. I had the Irish benny ( egss Benedict with corned beef hash) and grits. It was good. Hubby had the verde eggs, also good. Portions are large, food is good. Wait staff also good and friendly."}
{"text":"The chocolate chip pancakes (5 stars), salmon lox scramble (3 stars) were tasty. Service was good."}
{"text":"This place is so good wonderful staff  and excellent service! Saturday morning there will be a wait but it's worth h it!!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast place ever. Come here almost every Sunday and have tried numerous things and I've never had a bad experience. Great freshly squeezed orange juice, always beautiful to sit outside and look at the fountain. Great place!"}
{"text":"Came here based on all the good reviews and this place exceeded my exceptions. Danny is an excellent host. Food came out hot and delicious. I like the fact that they have some nice healthy options. Will return and recommend to friends, and family when they are in town."}
{"text":"First time here since it used to be LePeep ages ago. The decor was ok, not fancy, but not horrible. We were looking forward to the breakfast potatoes which look way better than they taste. A little on the bland side, unfortunately. I had my usual eggs Benedict and it was good, nothing spectacular. Also tasted the regular French toast which was good, but had the same ho hum okay-ness. Service /speed of food was what you'd expect from a breakfast place. Seems like a good place for families that don't want the am drunk crowd."}
{"text":"This place is BOMB. I've never been super into breakfast places, but this one is an exception. It's usually packed when I go, so make sure you've got the time, but it's definitely worth it. Staff is always friendly and the food is amazing. Scrambles, toast, pancakes, you name it. It's all good. They have more than the standard boring breakfast options you might find at IHOP and the quality is SO much better. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is solid, I like meeting here with my coworkers to go over pressing business items. Servers are extremely attentive and knowledgeable. Although they do make you drink too much coffee! :-)"}
{"text":"As good as Butterfield's and then some. Pecan waffle to perfection.  yogurt and granola parfait, huge!   Service was speedy, place was clean.  Sat in the back wing by the kitchen and it was not noisy and annoying, or chaotic.  Food was hot and prepared perfectly.  Coffee was not quite as strong as at Butterfield's, that was a downside.  Otherwise a perfect little restaurant in walking distance of my house."}
{"text":"The service was awesome ! The food was awesome! And the dining was awesome!! I cannot find anything wrong with this place the price was even great!!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I don't get the hype....After all to me it's just a diner...and I don't like the vibe inside...feels like a retirement home dining room...  Were the pancakes I had the best I ever had...no, they weren't...They were passable...  If you want bomb pancakes, my first choice is still Perk...  What I do like about Butters is the fresh squeezed OJ...now that was awesome...  What really made my day at Butters is the fact that a member of the US Army came in to surprise his girlfriend and propose to her...She had no clue he was coming that is...it did not seem staged for the cameras that is...as generally I see that stuff on TV that's about it...That was really sweet to witness such a moment....I had more my eyes on the cool Army stud in uniform, and you can call me a homo...I'm okay with that ah!  Service was OK...but yes, bottom line, I prefer Perk Eatery for the food..."}
{"text":"Just an average experience for us on Saturday of Memorial Day weekend.   We arrived pretty much right after everyone else arrived and thus had to wait nearly an hour for our table. We wasted away this time at the coffee shop in the strip mall adjacent to Butters (which I recommend). Just want to be clear that though we had to wait, it's not reflected in my overall rating.  I ordered the California scrambler. It was meh. At the very least, it needed salt. The portion size was huge and could have easily been split between two people. I much preferred brunching at ALMA.  No booze onsite which makes brunching less fun."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent and very friendly service.  We went today around 1:00.  They were serving both breakfast and lunch.  I had the scrambler with salmon.  My husband had a salad. Plenty of food!  Great toast and fresh fruit, and eggs!  Also great coffee.  Would definitely go there again!  We went around 1:00 and there basically was no wait."}
{"text":"This is my top brunch spot. The wild berry pancakes are are the best I've ever had. In between the pancakes is a marscapone and vanilla cream spread that was to die for. The classic eggs Benedict was great too. And if you have kids get them a hot chocolate. They are big mugs covered in whip cream and a chocolate syrup. Great treat for the little ones."}
{"text":"Great Eggs Benedict. I got the Florentine and my gf got a Classic Benedict. Overall good food."}
{"text":"Amazing food! I'd recommend the Country Benny, the New Mexico Skillet, and any of the pancakes! That's what we've tried so far and all have been amazing!"}
{"text":"Butters-- what can I say.  The FOOD here is over the top amazing and doesnt sit in your guts all morning after you have moved into the balance of your weekend routine. The food is clean and healthy and hot.  Perfect food.    This venue is also recently completely overhauled and essentially 2011 new on the inside, so you have shiny tables tops and linens, sparkling light fixtures, a good crowd-level ambience with loudness, but you dont have to yell at your tablemate to be heard.  My only hesitation here is service.  Every time we've gone, it's been 4 times now, we get another doe-eyed server, barely driving age or in freshman year of college who doesnt have ANY experience on waiting tables.  I mean every time. We even had to return a 'to go' order because they gave us regular pancakes, not banana.    If management pulls their training program together (and they had better, this is Scottsdale, and your competition will eat you alive), this a must see, must goto breakfast joint with a fresh and clean edge and better food.  If you can tolerate the quirky service with your NY Times or AZ Replublic in hand, you're in the right spot!"}
{"text":"Love Butters! Perfect pancakes, tasty turkey bacon, gourmet grits, creamy caramel macchiato,  fresh squeezed orange juice, and quick, efficient service! Nummmy!"}
{"text":"Great food and very fast service once you're seated. It's a popular place and we have found you must get there early on the weekends."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with the pancakes at this location. We had a family of 5 adults and a baby they're easily able to accommodate us however I was very surprised that we had to wait 20 minutes on a weekday for breakfast! I suppose it's because this place is amazing. I was happy to hear from the waitress when she's stopped by our table and when I asked for recommendations I had my eye on the Smores  pancake and she told me that they are extremely sweet. I was happy that she wasn't willing to just serve me anything and she gave me some recommendations. Really enjoyed my breakfast here service was quick and fast it is on the loud side but consider it more like a diner."}
{"text":"Good pancakes. Disliked the blitzes. They are not flexible with substitutions or changes."}
{"text":"The positive things you've read about Butters' food on Yelp are all true. The pancakes are great! Light and fluffy. My favorite in the Valley, except perhaps for the unique lemon enhanced cakes at The Original Breakfast House. Omelets? \"This is the best omelet I've had in ages,\" was the comment about the Mexicana Omelet during our most recent visit. The Garden Skillet? Solid. Mickey Mouse kids meal? Perfect. Even simple scrambled eggs are uniquely well prepared. The orange juice is fresh squeezed and the coffee is enjoyable black.  The \"children's brunch\" menu is basic; in other words, just what kids want. Reasonably priced. One cautionary comment: There are no special sizes or prices for kid drinks. You can accidentally double the price of your child's meal if you aren't paying attention.   So why not five stars? Nothing related to the food. Success, however, can create issues. Don't come here on a Saturday or Sunday morning unless you have some time to kill. They do a good job churning the customers, but given the choice I'd rather not be churned. Or feel so cramped. Our recent Sunday morning wait was shorter than promised, but once seated we had to wait for quite a while before being offered coffee, inexcusable for a breakfast joint. I like my coffee black and Butters' coffee does not disappoint. Others in our party who like to self-doctor their java, however, were not as happy. The only tool available was plain cream. Butters does serve vanilla lattes and the like, which was not pointed out by our waitress when an initial ordering inquiry was made about the availability of flavored creamers. An oversight, given that a vanilla latte would have definitely been preferred.   We were seated indoors and the ventilation in our area was less than adequate. It's hard to enjoy your hot coffee when you are perspiring. Finally, our credit card payment was mixed up with another table. While apologetically corrected, it is the type of thing that happens when a restaurant is operating beyond full capacity.  I love Butters. I just need to avoid Sunday mornings there."}
{"text":"I am here in Scottsdale on vacation. I was looking for a great breakfast place so I checked out Yelp.  I arrived @ Butters about 11AM on a Monday Morning. It was pretty busy, I would say a 30 Minute wait.  I ordered the whole hog skillet. It was nothing to write home about. My girlfriend ordered the original Benedict.. The hollandaise sauce was fantastic. Her friend ordered the waffles. They were airy/ fluffy.... very good! The wait staff and service were also helpful and cheery!!"}
{"text":"Butters' service and food are great! The service staff is always friendly and the food is consistently delicious. The menu is defiantly centered around breakfast comfort food. The portion sizes are great for families!"}
{"text":"I don't usually leave bad reviews. I've been dying to try this place for weeks. Drove 30 miles with excitement to try the food and did not even get to the ordering part. We were given a pager and told to wait 30-40 minutes. We waited patiently for our turn, 50 min in we ask if they were about to call us. To our surprise they had crossed our name off  the list and the pager did not go off because it was dead or something wrong with it. We were upset and asked if they could give us the next available table due to their flaw. The host was mean and said she could add us to the list again and we could wait 20-30 minutes. Sorry, but we will not wait 1.5 hrs to eat when you screw up.  It's a shame, the review is based on their service and professionalism and not on the food, we might never get to review on that portion based on this experience."}
{"text":"Butters is probably my favorite breakfast place. They have GF pancakes and great skillets! You get a lot of food and the service is quick. Even when it's busy, you get your food pretty fast."}
{"text":"We stayed the night in Scottsdale during our trip across country and decided to try Butters as per the other Yelp reviews. It was on the weekend so we waited about 15 min to be seated and as busy as it was, it was obviously one of the local breakfast spots. Food and service were both great!"}
{"text":"Pancakes and waffles are delicious. The bagel sandwich was good but the bagel itself was just ok. Service was very good. Very good meal overall."}
{"text":"Great food at a reasonable price! Service was also great.   Most meals come with hash browns or grits and pancakes or toast.   I got something simple, but easy to mess up. 2 eggs over medium, hash browns, pancakes, and sausage links. Sausage links were juicy, flavorful, and fat. Hash browns were thinly sliced potatoes and were mostly crispy. You can pay extra to upgrade plain pancakes to one of the flavored ones."}
{"text":"Both times I've been here the meal was exceptional. I'm critical. They're doing it right. First time I had the chicken salad sandwich. Best I've ever had. Second time I had the grilled cheese and bacon and sweet potato fries. Also delicious. Staff are very courteous. That's a word a lot of servers don't know- when you can get them off their phone. But at Butters they  were all extremely attentive and polite. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Great food! My waitress, Dina, was excellent. Lots of smiling faces and good food here."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite breakfast joint! The or con about this establishment is how popular they are: the wait is always about an hour, but it is definitely worth the wait. I've ordered the berry pancakes and have also had the southwestern rojo omelette...both excellent choices! The servers are super nice and I really appreciate the water that is already waiting for you at your table-no fuss, no muss! If you haven't gone here, GO. NOW!"}
{"text":"Ok.  Worth the wait for sure.  Fluffy pancakes, crispy hash browns, eggs perfectly over easy and above all really great and attentive service.  Easily 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I rarely give 5 stars to anything. I tried to find reasons to give this place 4 1/2 on whatever negative thing I encountered but none whatsoever!  We did have to wait half an hour to sit but for a place as good as this its to be expected. The food is outstanding as I had the Irish eggs bene and didn't wait long to devour it! I'm from Texas so if I'm ever back in Phoenix I'll be sure to visit!"}
{"text":"Service is great! Food arrives quickly and is always well prepared. I have only had to wait to be seated on 1 occasion and it was less then 20 minutes, day after Thanksgiving so it's understandable..."}
{"text":"We love this place. Service is outstanding every time we go. Food is delicious. Will be coming back!!"}
{"text":"Now I'm not saying it's the greatest breakfast place on the planet, but it's damn good. We're talking finally a new league outside of denny's good egg or *shutter* EggnJoe .. Gross. No. Butterfields brings the omelets. They have a clean atmosphere and skilled attentive waitstaff .. keep puffing up them egg whites chillin."}
{"text":"One of my top 3 favorite breakfast spots in the Phoenix area.  Love the variety of pancakes offered here.  Usually I will go with a friend and we will share a savory breakfast item and then share one of the pancakes.  The Oreo pancake is my favorite on the menu.  They have a coffee bar which is nice because you can grab a drink while you wait for your table."}
{"text":"Amazing. We love breakfast and this was one of the best. The waffle was amazing. The potatoes and chicken Sausage was Delish. We will be back."}
{"text":"This was a very mixed experience, and if it weren't for the great service once I was seated there would be even fewer stars. Let's start with the positive.  I ordered a skillet that was pretty good, and my fiancé ordered a scramble that was even better than my dish. We both got sides of pancakes which were really great. The syrup was genetic fake stuff which was disappointing, but the pancakes fluffiness made up for it. Coffee was constantly filled, and we left satisfied from the food...  However... The two hostesses we dealt with were clueless and rude. The one girl looked like a middle school student and quoted our wait at 25-30 minutes. We waited for 75 minutes to get a table. Missing a wait time by 15 minutes is acceptable, but missing by almost a hour is ridiculous. As for the other hostess we received a complementary order of smug. Apparently this girl had a large case of disinterested before coming into work, and was one of the least friendly and helpful hostesses I have ever dealt with. Despite good food and great service once I sat down, I would be hesitant to return based on my wait, rude hostess, and side of smug with my breakfast."}
{"text":"Super yummy!  I have only had their lunches but I hear breakfast is amazing.  I recommend the turkey jalapeno press, the Biltmore Club chicken sandwhich or the chorizo burger.  Their salads are also lovely."}
{"text":"Went on Saturday for brunch during the 4th of July holiday weekend.  We were a party of 4.5 and had to wait about 20 min (in 115 degree weather) at around 10:30AM but once we sat down, our orders were out very fast!  We ordered:   1. Corn Beef & Hash skillet with scrambled eggs and buttermilk pancakes (4 stars):  Good portion but the hash was scalloped potatoes and I was expecting shredded potatoes and the scalloped potatoes were just lacking flavor.    2. Brioche French Toast (4 stars): Solid with big portion.  3. Sausage and Biscuit (5 stars): Great flavor and super moist biscuit!!  4. Eggs Verde (4 stars): Good flavors and hearty but once again, the scalloped potatoes were not crispy and did not have much flavor.   Fresh squeezed OJ was the best!!"}
{"text":"Had a quick breakfast here and was pleased but not overly impressed. The corned beef hash skillet is something I would order again, but in the world of EPIC breakfasts in which they play, it was merely really good. I would definitely recommend this place for a casual breakfast and hearty servings. Be prepared to wait as it is a popular spot, even on a Wednesday morning at 8am."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot is Scottsdale! Little bit of a wait on the weekend before baseball, but well worth it. Friendly staff, delicious food! Can't go wrong with this place!"}
{"text":"We waited for 30 minutes and it was worth every minute! Our waitress was very kind and helped give us suggestions! The cafe is known for its Wild berry items. I ordered the wild berry pancakes and my mom ordered a scrambler; it came with hash browns and pancakes. The food was amazing! I would recommend going here for breakfast! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The BEST BREAKFAST PLACE in ARIZONA! You may have to wait an hour or more worth the wait! Thumbs up all around! I recommend to everyone that wants breakfast or lunch!"}
{"text":"As a visitor from San Francisco, I have really high brunch expectations as there is no shortage of delicious brunch joints in SF. Came here around 9:45 on a Friday after our hike at Camelback and did not expect there to be a wait on a working weekday. The wait was about 20 minutes for 2 people, reasonable for a seemingly popular brunch place.  I got the country benedict which was basically biscuits, sausage patty, gravy, and poached eggs with a choice of hash browns or grits. Biscuit and gravy was yummy. My boyfriend got the corned beef hash skillet, which came with a side of either toast or pancakes (he chose pancakes). We also ordered wildberry french toast to share.  Everything was amazing and totally fulfilled our brunch cravings. Wildberry french toast had a drizzle of fruit and vanilla syrup and was stuffed with mascarpone cheese. It wasn't too sweet or too egg-y, just the right amount of sweet fluffiness.  They have their own bottled syrup for the pancakes too! You can also order a coffee from the front barista to enjoy while waiting for a table, and black coffees get free refills once you get seated."}
{"text":"Meh, is right.....I've had better, lots better.  This place is nothing to rave about.  The first impression was the hostess Jessica.  She had a nasty look on her face and I didn't even see her smile once, the entire 30 minutes we waited to be seated. She must hate her job or she is in the wrong position. When spoken to her there was no expression or nice demeanor at all, you would think being a hostess you would put someone personable in that position. We had a party of 6 and sadly we were squeezed into the restaurant.  The place has too many tables you can't even move when you sit down. As for the food I order the classic Eggs Benedict, eggs were cooked perfectly, but overall still was blah, hash browns were under cooked.  Other people in our party had pancakes, which ended up being good, and another has an omelet, but how do you screw up an omelet. I don't have anything to say about the waitress, she was barely even seen, she took our order, and next time we saw her she brought the check.  Not sure why I even gave it 2 stars. We won't be going back there until they have new management or it changes companies. I would rather take the extra time and drive up the street to go and have some real breakfast at Tom's Thumb."}
{"text":"You cannot go wrong with anything that you order at Butters. Simply the best place to go for breakfast. There is a reason why there is a long wait line during the weekends, so go early! I've come here tons of times, and my go to are their buttery and fluffy pancakes.  If you are looking for a place that will meet everyone's breakfast needs...then this is your spot."}
{"text":"A bit of a wait, but it was Saturday morning. Good breakfast. Service was excellent (thanks Willy). Will come back to try lunch."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot!  The pancakes were some of the best that I've ever had.  I wish that I had ordered the OJ.  They were freshly squeezing when we were leaving, and it smelled amazing!"}
{"text":"Found this restaurant on YELP while staying in Scottsdale a few days. Great breakfast, great service. Whenever in Scottsdale this will definitely be our breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious. The wildberry bless pancake is amazing. Great breakfast spot. Will make this  a mandatory stop everytime i'm in town!"}
{"text":"the staffing was always there for the next round of drinks and doesn't keep you waiting if you need them. food is very good and comes visually prepared great. the place seemed to be a bit loud but it didn't get annoyingly loud.   the food was very good and average meal size. not too big, not too small. i got the Nutella Toast with banana and it was 10/10 would go again"}
{"text":"Pretty good brunch at a fair price. HUGE servings so come hungry.  I got the baked potato omelette and it was awesome. Basically a baked potato in an egg sandwich. Chocolate chip pancakes pretty standard.  I was with a large group and was able to get a table within 30 minutes. Everyone loved their food."}
{"text":"\"This vanilla latte is the best coffee I've had all year.\" It wasn't the artistic foam on top that sold me. The coffee was robust without a hint of bitterness. My table companion's regular cup of coffee was delivered with thick, heavy cream. (So thick watching it pour was entertainment.)  I'm sorry I didn't grab the name of our amazing server. But I did very much enjoy breakfast during a late lunch hour on a Sunday. Overwhelmed by the breakfast menu I selected a skillet. Why? They are served with a side of pancakes. (Or toast. But really, if you're going all in - GO ALL IN.)  The New Mexico skillet offered a spicy chorizo, avocado, peppers and potatoes. If heat is not your thing perhaps this dish is not for you. I luuuurved it. No need to sprinkle a dot of hot sauce anywhere!   Shhh! We used bank parking as it was Sunday. (The signage is clear. But it was Sunday!) This can be a popular joint for good reason."}
{"text":"This new location lives up to the superb standards set by the other two locations. They are the best in the business period. Incredible family owned business that sets the bar high and maintains it everytime we go. Try it and you'll see. If I could leave more than 5 stars I would!!"}
{"text":"I went here for a late Sunday brunch. I'm not often in the North Scottsdale area, but my boyfriend & I wanted to find a new place to have brunch so we decided to go up there before visiting the Musical Instrument Museum.   We got there around 1:15 and was told it would be a 15 minute wait..well, it turned into about 30, which was kind of annoying but thankfully since they gave us a menu we knew exactly what we wanted to order when we were finally seated.   I ordered the Eggs Verde, which is corn tortillas topped with black beans, cheese, eggs and salsa verde and it was supposed to come with hash browns. My boyfriend ordered ham and eggs with pancakes and hash browns. Shortly after ordering, the waitress indicated that they didn't have hash browns for my order so I opted to order fruit with mine. When our orders arrived, he had hash browns? It was a bit confusing...I'm not sure how you could run out of a breakfast staple such as potatoes?   Our food was ready quite quickly and it was really delicious. I really enjoy Mexican breakfast food in general and was not disappointed. I even stole a bite of my boyfriend's pancakes and they were very tasty. The waitress was very attentive and friendly. Overall it's a great breakfast spot with a variety of options to choose from.  I wish I could give it a solid 4 stars, although with the unexpected 30 minute wait and hash brown mystery I cannot. I'd be willing to check this restaurant out again though, if I'm ever up in North Scottsdale again."}
{"text":"I love Butters because of how the service was so fast and how the food just tasted really great. It is a nice place,if you go there you're going to taste the greatest food ever. Hannah (I'm on my dad's phone shhhhh...)"}
{"text":"We went to Butters around  11am on a Saturday and had about a half hour wait to be seated. Popular place! When we were seated, the waitress came over immediately and got us our coffee and orange juice. There was a carafe of ice water on the table. Coffee was good. OJ was fresh squeezed. I ordered an omelet with hash browns and pancakes - all very good! Our food was served quickly and the service was attentive. Very impressive considering how busy the place was! And since it was it Scottsdale, there were a lot of 40 and 50 something women patrons with big ol' fake fun bags (if you are into that sort of thing)! All in all a very good place for breakfast if you don't mind a bit of a wait!"}
{"text":"My husband and I regularly visit Butters. Never once have we had an issue. The food is always perfection! All of the servers have their jobs down because every one of them is extremely attentive! The only negative I would state is it's become so popular it's more difficult to walk right in without a wait. But they deserve it!"}
{"text":"Terrible experience just trying to get seated for Breakfast.  Empty restaurant wouldn't seat us until all people in the party were present. Just wanted to get started with a cup of coffee.  Not a family friendly place. Won't be back. Chris (manager/owner). Was very rude!!  Go across the parking lot the breakfast place is much better!!!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in the area, small seating area so go early or anticipate a wait.  Waffles are excellent!!!  Location near spring training at Talking Stick and great golf.  Check it out."}
{"text":"So far haven't even been seated yet. We knew it would be a wait and that wasn't much of a problem for us. The kicker on this one is when we arrived to put our name in the hostess (who I am pretty sure is 12) was clearly flustered and irritated, looked at us expectantly and said \"yes?\" Not hello, how are you, welcome, how many? But \"yes?\" Strike one. We were told 20-30 minutes.... We have been waiting for 30 and were just told it would be another 20..... Hmmm.... Maybe you should learn to round those numbers up dear. Another young lady has now joined the infantile hostess with an ever worse attitude. We were clearly bothering her by asking how much longer our wait would be. Again, no smile, no welcome, didn't even offer us a glass of water on this steamy Arizona morning. Hopefully we will be seated soon and hopefully all of the food reviews are not a lie and my morning will be saved."}
{"text":"Really shocked at the person reporting a 10-15 minute wait because after multiple waits of 30 minutes or more we have given up on this place.  The Breakfast club uses an app called no wait where you can get in line before you get there, I think this place should try it. I asked about call ahead seating and they said they don't do that. This is the closest breakfast place to us so I was disappointed but its not that good that it is worth the wait. We now go to Hash Kitchen which pretty much never has a wait and has a better menu with better gluten free options."}
{"text":"This is my wife and my first stop here. All I can say is delicious! We both had an egg/pancake meal and it was one of the best breakfasts we've had...and we're breakfast people. Surprisingly it's actually really affordable as well, even with added drinks and specialty pancakes!   My wife had the strawberry pancakes and I had the protein power pancakes, both were great! They are apparently know for their pancakes.  It was a bit of a long line, but that's to be expected with how busy it is. We will definitely be coming back again when we're in the area....or even if we're not, we'll make the trip.  p.s. My wife wanted me to mention that they serve Harney and Sons tea. A hot commodity apparently among tea drinkers."}
{"text":"I cannot believe the crazy props this place has received! I went this morning and, though it was not bad by any means, it was not rave worthy. The BF and I got there at about 10 and waited for 15 minutes or so. We were seated outside, which was a bit warm, but not bad. We started by ordering coffee and they brought coffee and real cream! YES real cream!!! I was so excited but then, like some higher power knew I was having a moment of pure joy and wanted to crush it, the coffee was terrible! Like made me feel a little nauseous bad. The real cream could not save it. That is how bad it was. The BF tried the plain pancakes to test a simple offering and I ordered the eggs verde on the suggestion of our server. The pancakes were fine, but the portion was a bit small for the price. The verdes were decent, but nothing special and the black beans in it were undercooked (What is with the undercooked beans lately??). Anyway, I wouldn't go out of my way to go back here, but if they were giving it away for free, I suppose I would eat it."}
{"text":"Worth the 30 minute wait, so good! SIL and I split the garden scramble that came with a side pancake, perfect amount. Hubs had the Whole Hog and 12YO had a side of Oreo Pancakes which was still too big for him to finish!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place!! The have the best breakfast food! Haven't tried lunch yet! I've ordered their omelette, pancakes and had a smoothie another time! My servers have always been very nice. It gets packed so expect a wait. I think it's really worth it though!"}
{"text":"A busy breakfast spot but they get you in quickly!  After you are seated I never feel rushed to leave.  Great service and plenty of choices.  I usually get the California Scramble which comes with potatoes or grits AND pancakes or toast.  Are you kidding me!  Deal city!  I sometimes swap out regular pancakes for the Protein Pancakes-crunchy, fruity goodness."}
{"text":"Here's what I got.   A breakfast that tasted good, just like it looks. A clean restaurant and good timely and attentive service.   The Irish Benedict was good, not unusually good but good. The hash browns are good, look good and taste just like you'd expect.   I'm a fan of surprise tastes, something unique, an unusual flavor even if it's small differences. You don't get that here. Manage your expectations and plan on a usual for breakfast meal and you'll most likely enjoy the place.   As for me, I'm off to some unusual place, have to go through lots of these to find those cool places with a unique flavor, bit I'll find it."}
{"text":"First went here after seeing a friend check in on Yelp at this place. When we arrived there was a crowd outside waiting in the heat, so had a feeling it might be good. Got seated pretty quickly and placed our orders after tough decision from the many good sounding options they have. Food came out quickly and nicely presented on the plates. Everybody loves the dish they choose. Will be going back here again. We'd go more often but it a bit of a drive from us, but worth the trip this time, and in the future will make it again."}
{"text":"This is now one of  my favorite breakfast joints!! The food was excellent I've never had such a fluffy and tastier omelette than this one it was a veggie With Zucchini, mushrooms, bell peppers, Spinach, and avocado sooo delicious I had half and was full! The service was the best I've ever seen everyone friendly from the moment you stepped in and the waitress and other servers were always asking us if we were good, needing more coffee, etc. OUR food was on the table like in 5 minutes?Loved this place 5 starsOh and this place is so clean! Highly recommended CHECK THIS PLACE  OUT!!"}
{"text":"I guess I did not get a good dish. I tried the new mexico skillet. I was unimpressed by it and the portion was small."}
{"text":"You're not going to find a better breakfast place the Butter's. I've been to many of breakfast spots and can't think of a better place.   At first it seems like all other breakfast places until you get to the menu. So many delicious options. My table ordered skillets, pancakes, omelettes, and eggs benedict and everything was great.   The cinnamon roll pancakes are prefect.   Great coffee."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a late breakfast here with some family and friends. Had the Irish Eggs Benedict with hashbrowns and cornbeef hash. They put the hollandaise on the side. Others had egg whites and buttermilk pancakes. Everything was great...bar is set pretty high in terms of expectations. Large portions...enough for breakfast and lunch. Poached eggs were perfect."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate at Butters for the 1st time today. We got there about 10am on a Tuesday morning and there was a 20+ minute wait with a limited waiting area. With that being said, the wait was well worth it!  Our orders were promptly taken and the food arrived faster than we expected. I had biscuits and gravy with eggs and my husband had the mexican omelet with pancakes. The food was so delicious i wanted to eat it all, however the portions were HUGE! The wait staff was excellent and very on top of everything. We will definately plan to go back!"}
{"text":"Food was AWESOME!!!  Service was GREAT too!!!  We can't wait to come back again soon....maybe even tomorrow!!! :)"}
{"text":"Not the place I would pick, but, DANG!  Everything was just great, from the text that our table was ready to the bill and everything in between.  Note to corporate chain restaurants:  Study this place and then under promise and over deliver!"}
{"text":"I had a nice brunch here with my wife on Memorial Day.  Good quality food with friendly service. I did not know there is a second branch on Northsight.  I hope a branch store will open in Ocotillo/Chandler."}
{"text":"This place was packed as expected for a Sunday morning. The service was fast, a little too fast to enjoy the moment. They did offer gluten free options, the waffle I got was good, but thought it to be a bit cakey. Husband got the Rojo eggs and he said they were ok, but nothing to write home about. This place could have more potential if the food had more quality and flavor focus. However, the fresh squeezed orange juice was quite tasty!"}
{"text":"I know this gets amazing reviews, but I don't see it (nor did I taste it). Everything was mediocre to absolutely bad. Coffee was weak. Grits were not tasty (and I love grits). Nothing was yummy (want, yummy, go to Mike's Cafe in Tempe). Also, it has no soul. No ambiance. Sorry, I just had to post this review as another opinion."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited this place today . And will definitely be back. We had the Santa fe scrambled with pan cakes, and  the ham and eggs. The scrambled is very soft and tasty and the ham and eggs are great. Our server Desiree is nice and helpful. Thanks to you, Diseree! Highly recommend...."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Good service. Busy on weekends. Delicious gluten-free options. Try the gluten-free waffles!"}
{"text":"Seriously delicious breakfast food. The line moved quickly and the pancakes filled with berries and some interesting cream sauce was outstanding. Craving to eat it again the next time we are in town!!!!"}
{"text":"Almost as good as Pancake Houses get- they have many options for delicious filled pancakes and omelettes. The service is fast and dishes are reliable. Special treat to eat such yummy breakfast food. ."}
{"text":"This was a pretty good little breakfast place. It seems like it is a place locals come, which is always nice. The service was very fast and moderately friendly. The prices were reasonable and the food was decent. I had the whole hog skillet with pancakes and my husband had the country Benny with pancakes. Both were good, but nothing to write home about. I guess the pancakes were my favorite thing. They were delicious. The menu has a huge selection. Overall a decent meal, but nothing stood out as being fantastic."}
{"text":"If you have out-of-town visiters and want to WOW them take them to Butters. My guests kept remarking about the great and fast service. They made their special request for lox omelets which was not on the menu.  Delicious french toast in many varieties.  I had tge one with muscarpone. Terrific!"}
{"text":"If you're going here on a weekend, prepare for a long wait (breakfast place on the weekend? Shocker.) Once seated and the order had been placed, the food came VERY fast, which I hear is the norm.   The orange juice is killer, worth the money. I ordered an egg white omelette which was a lot of food and was very good. It came with two small pancakes on the side and they were also worth it.  Quick service and good breakfast food. Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Butters is amazing. Highly recommend coming here. Haven't had a bad item on the menu yet."}
{"text":"Love Butters! The cinnamon roll pancakes and the wild berry bliss pancakes are the best! I recommend getting a meal and upgrading the toast for a pancake for only about a dollar more."}
{"text":"This breakfast place was a short bike ride away from the resort I stayed at in Scottsdale. Their menu has all of the typical categories for breakfast. I ordered the french toast with a side of eggs and fresh squeezed OJ. I would definitely recommend it if you're staying in the area. Although there was a long wait to be seated, the service itself was quick."}
{"text":"Ordered corned beef hash, hope hog skillet, and wild every crepes. All fire  Ashley was our server. Super fast"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place. Pancake place that lives up to its name. Light and bright. Lots to choose from on the menu. Espresso machine was a pleasant surprise."}
{"text":"This was a great place for our breakfast. I had the banana cream pancakes and they were great. Husband had the Swedish pancakes and he was very happy  with them and his coffee. Great staff. We will co e here again."}
{"text":"Bomb.com! Be prepared to wait a little as this place is very busy...even at 8am on a Sunday morning. The wait was worth it! I had the classic benny and my husband had the corned beef hash benny. The eggs were poached to perfection. Great experience here in AZ!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding breakfast!  Whether in Scottsdale, Phoenix, or Tempe,  you have to eat at Butters at least once.  Menu, food, and service are excellent.  Easy to find and easy to park.  But go early, it gets busy and there can be a wait.  Even as busy as it was the service was top notch and our food came out amazingly fast.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place of all time! My husband and I have been to Butters several times. I order a different flavor French Toast each time and my husband also tries something new. The banana cream pancakes are TO DIE FOR. We haven't had anything on the menu that we didn't throughly enjoy. Also, if you don't mind a little splurging get the fresh squeezed orange juice. It is simply amazing! The only negative is that they are very popular so sometimes there is a lengthy wait time. But trust me, it's worth it! Sitting outside on the patio is nice but not a great view of the traffic intersection. Service is always great and everyone working there has been friendly. Can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast! Everything we ordered was so good, and the service was great. If we had discovered this place sooner, we probably would've eaten here several times during our trip."}
{"text":"Picked up lunch to go after finding this joint of yelp. My chicken cranberry salad was really good...chicken breast was sliced thin and I liked the balsamic dressing. The boys were super happy with their turkey clubs.  Fast and friendly service."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast.  Huge huge portions.  Good service a bit of a wait for tables. Fair prices will go back"}
{"text":"Amazing wild berry dishes with marscapone. I like the wild berry crepes a bit better then the wild berry pancakes or French toast, but all three are delicious!  Amazing Eggs Benedict where the eggs are cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"Wanted to try something new for breakfast. The food was good. There was a bit of a wait going on a Saturday. I had eggs benedict and it was very good."}
{"text":"Great selection and good breakfast.  Wait was not long and the service was excellent.  I ordered one of the veggie omelets and it was as expected.  This place doesn't blow you away, but is a safe bet for a good breakfast."}
{"text":"If ur craving pancakes this is the place to go. Service is great. Menu has several options"}
{"text":"Service professional, all items ordered come on timely manner, all items ordered were excellent, surprisingly they're able to maintain quality across all items ordered."}
{"text":"So good so much food! My wife and I got scrambled. She got salmon I got chorizo, both were delicious. We did an up charge for cinnamon roll pancakes, wow amazing! I would recommend the grits over the hash browns. Even if you don't like grits you'll like these. They are fast about getting people in and out!"}
{"text":"Upon recommendations from friends living in the Scottsdale area, we ventured here on our way to a spring training game.  Although we had a large party of 6 we got seated in only a few minutes.  (After walking out there was already lines of people outside so we got very lucky).  Walking to our table we noticed they have a true coffee bar with locally roasted beans so you can get your cappuccino fix.  There's also a fresh squeezed orange juice machine that pumps out amazing OJ...you finally get what you pay for in this liquid gold.  The restaurant was clean but felt like a run of the mill pancake house...I should have known otherwise by the passion in the OJ and coffee.  We ordered just about everything on the menu but the one thing that stuck out in my mind were the side of pancakes that came with my meal.  I don't even like pancakes...I'm a waffle guy but the pancakes with mascarpone are to die for!  The mascarpone they put between the pancakes offers a creaminess without too much sweetness.  While filing out of the restaurant we noticed SF Giants star outfielder Hunter Pence waiting in line for a table (I bet they didn't notice it was him  :) ).  He was super kind to take a picture with my mother-in-law but the point is that he was willing to wait in line to eat here...you should too.  I will ensure a trip up here each time I visit Phoenix.  This is one of the most delicious things I've ever eaten at breakfast in my life."}
{"text":"They have really delicious chocolate chip pancakes."}
{"text":"Very good restaurant but also very crowded. We came here to meet former football players at Stanford who live in Arizona"}
{"text":"Always good. This is one of my favorite places for breakfast and brunches. The only negative side? The waiting time, especially on Sundays around 10-11 am where all the Scottsdale population reunites for brunch. Fortunately they have a very efficient method: they take your name and phone number and notify you once your table is ready. So take my advice: go there and put your name down, then go do something else in the waiting time and come back when you get the call. This is less stressful that just get frustrated with an empty tummy.   Once you finally sit down then it's all fun time. The menu is amazing with plenty of options including sides. Coffee is good and freshly brewed and the service is quick. You can either sit inside or outside. Again, I'll come back here a million times if I can. Of course, if this place was a little bit bigger that would eliminate the waiting list issue. ;-)"}
{"text":"It was our first meal in Phoenix, and it was just what we needed to start our day. Luckily we didn't have to wait long to get seated. We got seated outdoors and let the sun warm us up. The menu is huge, and I was overwhelmed with options with so many things I wanted to try and get. I got the New Mexico Skillet and polished that right off, and had some of my boyfriend's pancakes as well and they were delicious. Our waitress was really nice and the prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been here several times to meet her family because it is in the middle of the 2 houses.  You need to get here early in the morning because they are busy.  The food here is amazing, last time I ordered the pancakes and I should have ordered a bigger size so I could have taken some home.  When you come you have to sit close to the Orange Juice machine.  Watching it is a great part of the visit.  The staff is super friendly, you'll love it."}
{"text":"I'm always looking for a new breakfast place and this was a fun one to try.  Tucked away in a shopping square off Hayden and Via de Ventura, Butters offers some local good eats.  Service deserves 5 star.  When you walk in, the restaurant feels fresh and clean.  It offers a good menu full of options.  We tried the California scrambler and the corned beef skillet.  The California was scrumptious with moist chicken, chunks of avocado and properly cooked eggs.  The hashbrowns were also crisp golden brown.  I chose the corned beef due to another Yelper giving it a great review....  maybe if I were not a corned beef lover and did not mind the canned variety I would feel differently.  But, in my opinion, the best local cafes offering this dish make their own corned beef hash that doesn't come pre-salted from a can.  So as you can assume, this was a huge disappointment to me.    Oh, and as assumed, Sm'oreo pancakes are too sweet.  That's my own fault for ordering.  If it were closer to my house I might frequent this more often, however I do not see enough unique items to bring me back!  I prefer Butterfield's, Breakfast Joint, and Chez Vous anytime"}
{"text":"Went with my 19 year old son for late breakfast today. Sadly, the food is delicious. It's everything else that ruined it! The waitress never cracked a smile and just seemed annoyed to even have to wait on us. We are about the friendliest people you could wait on so I have to believe she either doesn't like her job or just has a general over-all bad attitude. My son and I both ordered waffles. There was no syrup on the table so I asked her to bring some maple syrup with order. After she walked away we noticed that we were the only table without a bottle of syrup, so I grabbed a bottle from the table next to us. The waffles came, hot and delicious. When we got the check my son picked it up to look at it and he noticed that there was a charge of $1.75 for each of our little individual syrups that came with the waffle (which neither of us ended up using as we used the large bottle we had grabbed from the other table). When I asked the waitress about the charge she told me that \"we had ordered syrup\". I , of course said I had just asked for syrup ( not ordered) their \"gourmet\" syrup that I didn't even know about! She said she would have the manager take it off. She ended up sending some other employee over who insisted I had ordered syrup, which I guess translated into ordering their SPECIAL syrup. If you think this is sounding absurd, we're on the same page! I am the least picky or cheap person you could ever meet! It was 100% the principle! I even gave the lackluster waitress a 20% tip just because that's the kind of person I am! In the end, they took the charge off for one of the syrups because I had opened mine, but son hadn't. Mr. or Ms. Manager.....shame on you! In this day and age, the least we can expect when we have lots of dining options is to be treated as a valued customer! I'll be going back to Butterfields where there is good food and service with a smile!"}
{"text":"Yummmmmm seriously!!!! The pancakes here are delicious. But everything is. Even just the egg whites scramble."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast spots in Arizona! As you would expect with the name, the pancakes are amazing!  They have some great healthy options as well, and they are very cool about subbing out things or ordering something completely custom. Everything I ordered was great and I always leave absolutely stuffed because I just want to keep eating. Definitely going to come back here more often.  There is a wait a lot of times, but the staff does a good job moving people around and communicating to the customers. All around an excellent breakfast spot! Great food & great service."}
{"text":"The eggs benny on point. My cuzo ordered the mexican omelet. That green sauce just brought it to life. This place is worth the trip to scottsdale. Bringing my wife n kids for sure!!!"}
{"text":"This was the first place I had breakfast in Arizona. So it holds a sentimental place in my heart. That being said, this place has the most amazing coffee and breakfast food. Because of this though, be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"We went with our 89 year old mother and when the table was ready they made us wait until the 3rd person in our party was there. He was down the street. He would have gotten to the table at the same time if we were able to get seated because my mother can't walk fast but the hostess insisted we wait. Nasty hostess. Limited parking. Nice patio but it was closed on a Saturday morning? Not dog friendly."}
{"text":"Stands true to its reviews .. We did had to wait for our turn but definitely worth the wait ..   Our party ordered pancakes, French toast, veggie wrap and over medium eggs .. the food came out quick .. and yummmy tasty!!!  We loved the hash browns.. crispy and hot :)  Definitely 5 stars"}
{"text":"Butters is HANDS DOWN one of my new favorite breakfast/brunch spots in town and my only disappointment is that I didn't discover this place sooner!  I came here with five coworkers for brunch and ordered the \"build your own omelette\" deal and it was terrific. The omelette was enormous (honestly looked like at least 8 eggs!) and it came with breakfast potatoes and two large pancakes. They really do give you A LOT of food for $10 bucks which is becoming increasingly uncommon in Scottsdale.   I love that they don't \"a la carte\" you to death the way so many other brunching establishments do!  Anyway, I loved absolutely everything- the omelette was extremely tasty (could've used a bit more cheese though), the potatoes were lightly cooked (not burned to a crisp like so many places!) and really, really good. Also the pancakes were fluffy and flavorful.  Most of my coworkers ordered salad or sandwiches with fries and honestly I was salivating over their plates as well as mine. Everything looked SO delicious- especially the French fries. I must try those on my next visit!"}
{"text":"Food ad service and fast and sweet!!! Be sure you're not in a hurry,  the wait time is long- the food is delicious"}
{"text":"So you're tired from adventuring at Spring Training, maybe even hungover, check out Butters for your morning fix. The coffee is fantastic and the servers keep your mug filled.  The menu is huge - pancakes, French toast, omelettes, you get the idea. My son won breakfast with the Classic Brioche French toast.   The 2 egg combo was super fluffy and looked like they used 6 eggs. The hash browns were cooked to crispy perfection  They bring you a tiny pitcher of cold, fresh cream for your coffee which is perfection in my opinion.  . My daughter loved the chocolate chip pancakes - heaps of mini choc chips stuffed into each one and piled on top.  Hubs got the Mexican omelet which was HUGE and he was a big fan of every bite.   Bottom line - It's a sure bet if you're looking a good meal to fill you up before day drinking (or post workout if you're gonna be like that)."}
{"text":"Simply the finest staff, from mgt to server to bussers that I have ever experienced. Everyone is friendly and well trained. The food Is excellent.  Please come late so I can get a table!!!!!"}
{"text":"Try the potato omelet! Funny how people will line up and wait 40 minutes for a place when 1.5 miles away is an almost as good spot with no wait. But then that \"almost\" is the difference, isn't it? That little margin of difference in ambiance, in level of service, in presentation, in quality of fruit cup and in relative burnedness of toast separates the men from the boys in breakfast places. Butters does well. My fiancé made his own omelette with egg whites and turkey bacon, mushroom, tomato and spinach. He pronounced it perfect - \"nice and fluffy.\" He loved the grits, too."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, what can I say, except they have the best pancakes I have ever eaten. And I really don't want to say this as it feels like I am betraying my grandmother's good name. But dang it all, these are big, thick and fluffy pillows of goodness. I am happy I had the plain pancake to gauge the deliciousness of them. Even though it was hard to make the decision because they have some insanely delicious options, such as an Oreo pancake.  What is even better is that it came with the omelette I had ordered. Which not to detract from the awesomeness of their pancakes... But their omelettes are amazing as well. They are about three inches thick. I believe they have to add some of their amazing pancake batter to the mix to make their omelettes so thick and fluffy because I think they were standard three egg omelettes. Maybe I am wrong, but who cares because they are so delicious. This place even blends their own cheeses to ensure quality!   Love at first bite!"}
{"text":"Great food Noone at the table was disappointed and I was with 6 friends. Will go back very yummy food and good service"}
{"text":"Santa Fe Scrambler with grits was an awesome breakfast. I highly recommend. Reasonably priced too! Overall, everything was fresh, from the orange juice that I mixed with cranberry to the coffee! This is now my go to breakfast place."}
{"text":"We were able to get a seat quickly as it is a Friday at 11a. Nice patio with large fountain close. It is close to the road so you can hear traffic. The food was great. We chose the California Omlette and for $1.50 up charge we added premium pancakes which we chose wild berry. Eggs were delicious and the pancakes were very tastie. We were able to choose GF option with the pancakes. Will return."}
{"text":"The Wildberry Bliss pancakes were in fact blissful.  Even without syrup, the vanilla mascarpone and vanilla cream really made the dish.  When we order pancakes and a savory dish for breakfast, I usually only partake of a few bites.  However, I almost finished off my pancakes this time.  I also liked that they carried coffee from the local and esteemed Passport coffee.  Usually most breakfast places carry half-rate coffee, but at Butters you could get your great coffee with your breakfast.  The New Mexico Skillet didn't come in a skillet and wasn't doing much for me.  It didn't seem to have all of the ingredients that were listed on the write-up either.  I was wanting some sauce too.  Oh well, I was enamored enough with the pancakes that that was okay.  My husband was pleased with his Eggs Rojo.  The rojo sauce was almost like a smoky enchilada sauce and was very flavorful.  I was a little disappointed when I asked for a side of salsa for my egg dish and not only was it extra but it looked like plain Pace sauce that I used to get growing up.  Yuck.  Anyways, overall, I would still say with the originality of the entrees, the superb pancakes, and the high quality coffee, I would still give the place high ratings."}
{"text":"This location is much better than the Butterfield location. I've tried different plates from the menu and I was never disappointed. However I didn't like their orange juice which they claim is freshly squeezed. Other than it I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Food was fantastic! Huge portions, cute building complex, very attentive waiters! Just Great!!"}
{"text":"Me and my wife were here recently to have breakfast while on our vacation to Grand canyon. We chose this place after we found it on Yelp with very high recommendations. We went there early around 7:30 am. I ordered Chorizo sausage egg Scrambler (i think it was called California Scrambler) with hash browns and Iced Caffe Mocha, both of which were amazing! Food was really yummy!. There is ample parking in the compound. I think the place is open from 6 am to 2 pm everyday. I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Alright.... So yes this place is pretty new. If you have been to the Butter's down the street you know coming in that the wait is going to be a little wait. & yes we waited the 30min which is pretty normal for Butter's (so be prepared)    As soon as you walk in you see how pretty and clean this new spot is. I love the splash of orange across the restaurant.    I was pretty impressed, it being new & all I was expecting the staff to be new & untrained. But that wasn't the issue they are so on top of everything, I got my cup of coffee refilled 3 times. Our water ran low and 2 seconds later we had a whole new ice cold jug set down on the table. Our waitress and even some others where there to see if we needed anything.    So overall experience is a 5. I'm sure it will continue to stay that way. My family & I will be back. By the time I went to take a pic of their plates, they were almost half gone. Will try next time my fellow yelpers.   Florentine Benny, with a side of avo was amazing!!! Try it."}
{"text":"I was in town for a week and I heard a number of people mention this place, so I decided to stop in for breakfast one morning. I sat outside in their patio, which was delightful. The waitress was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Butters is second to none in all of Scottsdale and the entire valley. Staff is great. The pancakes........OMG... the pancakes are so damn good you'd swear they used ferry dust in the batter. The cheese grits.......Y-E-S!! Tried about 20 other breakfast spots all over the valley. They can't hold a candle to Butters. If you are ever in Scottsdale, Arizona and you want a top quality breakfast, go to Butters."}
{"text":"Love this place and I've tried several things here and they are all great. Love the chicken wrap, veggie wrap, pancakes, and salads. There aren't many places I can stare for minutes at the menu because of all my options. That's saying a lot because I'm picky. Never had a bad experience here either."}
{"text":"On a quick getaway to Scottsdale we found this little gem. Everything was so amazing we returned the next day. There's a line but stick around. It moves quickly and so worth it!"}
{"text":"My first time coming to this location after visiting their other location about four times. I ordered the same thing I've ordered at their other location. I was so disappointed. The food was bland and the pancakes sucked. They tasted...flat. Definitely not the level of food I've come to expect from Butters. My bf and I couldn't really put our finger on what was missing. If I had to guess, it was like it was cooked without love. I won't be coming to this location in the future."}
{"text":"First time here and I will be back again! Incredible food! Everything was cooked perfectly and the service was fast and efficient! This place is on my favorites list now :)"}
{"text":"This bigger-than-it-looks restaurant is near my wife's office. We've passed by it so many times, but while we were out and about in the area on a day off we decided to stop in instead. We're very glad we did.  We were told up front there'd be about a 10 minute wait. Might have been that long, but I'm really not sure. While we were waiting, we were just so fascinated watching the staff work it just didn't matter. Once seated, we were greeted quickly by our server who got us fresh squeezed orange juice (we watched it being squeezed before we sat down) and coffee.  We both ordered the whole hog skillet (bacon, sausage, and ham on hash browns with eggs cooked to order). She had egg whites and a side of toast. I had eggs over easy and a side of pancakes, their signature dish. While the skillets were both great, the pancakes were even better. They were the lightest and fluffiest we've ever had.  Service was exceptional and the efficiency of the staff in turning over tables and serving food and drinks prompted us to pull the manager aside to compliment the crew. Eating here was a great start to a fun day.  Edited November 11, 2013: Five star review drops to three.  \"No substitutions.\"  In very tiny print at the bottom of their menu are the above two words. Today, my wife ordered breakfast to go which she's done many times. This time she asked for oatmeal with banana and cranberries, but wanted blueberries instead of cranberries. It was the first substitution she's asked for from them. She didn't see the very tiny print forbidding such a thing.  The person on the phone told her in no uncertain terms that they didn't do substitutions. Then, she backtracked. Seems they actually do substitutions if you're willing to pay an extra couple of dollars.  Now, that might not seem like much, but let's take a look at what she wanted to do.  Substitute blueberries for cranberries.  That's it.  These are reasonably comparable products as far as price goes.  There's no extra effort involved in using blueberries instead of cranberries aside from the person in the kitchen mixing the berries into the oatmeal having to pay attention to the order ticket.  So, why in the world does it cost $2.00 to to make such a substitution?  The only thing I can think of is the folks at Butters think so much of themselves and their exquisite taste in food combinations that to deign to stoop to the uneducated whims of their customers, they must penalize us for our horrid taste.  As high quality as their food and service generally are, I personally won't set foot in their restaurant again. I don't feel the need to pay extra to someone to insult me."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast spot. My new fav! Everything including service was wonderful. Definitely recommend their pancakes. The berry pancake came w so much fresh fruit!! The cinnamon pancake was like a Cinnabon  Loved the spinach, bacon and Monterey Jack scramble!! Cheese grits were so creamy. It's nice you can substitute your side for a pancake. Will be coming back again real soon!"}
{"text":"My mouth is watering thinking of the food I had. We're not from AZ but I found this place on yelp and we decided to try it; definitely recommend to all who visit Scottsdale! The wild berry French toast was delicious. My husband had the eggs benny/Florentine. Our son had a Mickey Mouse pancake (which was also delicious). Fresh squeezed OJ-nothing better than fresh juice! This place is popular, 20-30 min wait on a Saturday morning."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. We were seated immediately. It was very clean inside. We checked out the menu and I ordered the Mexicana omelette and hash browns with English muffin. 5 minutes later we were served. The omelette was very good as well as the potatoes. This place definitely deserves another visit. I'll be back!   This is update of my third visit to Butters cafe. It was busy today, waited about 15 min for party of 3. Ordered the Eggs Rojo with spicy chorizo. It's was fantastic! Highly recommended this dish! Service was very good. Also, the hash brown potatoes are great. The cafe latte was tasty too. I've tried something new each time I have been here, with no disappointments. The food is always great. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Looking for that one go to breakfast place in Scottsdale / Phoenix area, this is a good place but my standard is still the Hash House A Go Go in San Diego's Hillcrest area.  Had the Create your Omelette with Corn Beef Hash and Mushrooms with Hash Browns and Oreo S'more Pancakes. The Omelette was as big as a Chipotle Burrito but was lacking a little flavor and Corn Beef Hash. The Oreo S'more Pancakes were pretty good and a very creative combination, have to give them props on that portion.  We also ordered the fresh squeezed OJ and was very good. They have a machine that loads up oranges and then feeds it into the machine to generate the fresh squeezed juice and it is very good and can not get any more fresh.  The inside decor is classic and very nice with the area around in a nice shopping area, we went of a Monday late afternoon where there was no wait.   Will come back again to try other pancakes or breakfast items and maybe the salads or the Strawberry Cheesecake French Toast. Definitely like the different dishes that they offer."}
{"text":"Very nice place.  Super busy at 9:30 on Saturday A.M. but we were told this is pretty normal.  Had the pecan pancakes.  Four smaller sized pancakes but tasted pretty good.  Wife had scrambled egg (1) and one blueberry pancake.  Said the egg was the best scrambled egg she ever had!  Though $3.00 for coffee/tea was a little pricey.  Noise level pretty high."}
{"text":"I am visiting from California and found this place on Yelp. It is fabulous loved the service, atmosphere and food!!! I had strawberry waffles,  the waffles were crispy outside,  soft inside with fresh strawberries and whip cream.  Our Server, Dorothea was Marvelous"}
{"text":"Great pancakes.  Ordered Denver omelet and potatoes they were excellent!  Coffee was so good.  Service was excellent.  I highly recommend this pancake house."}
{"text":"After playing eenie meenie minne mhhhoo, I weeded Butters over 5 other breakfast restaurant. It was a little whiles away, but I am sooo happy we chose it! Our server was Rafael. Cool, calm, collected, took our order, gave me some good highlights of the menu.  Food came, literally within 10 minutes, and we were diggin' in. I ordered the chorizo omelette, chedder grits,  and it also came with pancakes. I never had chorizo omelette, so I wasn't sure what I was getting into, it is a tad oily, but that is from the chorizo, however the veggies and egg balanced it out. CHEDDER GRITS delicious! My boyfriend stealth the rest. I cried. Pancakes, fluffy, buttery, melts in your mouth- probably the best set of pancakes ever. I ate it all. Then I cried.   We don't quite live in the area, so I am quite bummed that we'd will probably never have Butters again. It was a great choice for us, we enjoyed the service and food. Thanks Butters!"}
{"text":"Loved, Loved, our breakfast.  Chatted with Danny, the barista, while we were waiting to be seated.  Super nice guy.  Ordered the banana cream french toast.  It was fantastic.  The hash browns, perfectly cooked were so good.  Husband had ham omelette, which was huge and fluffy.  FRESH squeezed orange juice.  Couldn't have asked for a better breakfast.  Will be back here for sure"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite restaurant in all of Scottsdale! I love breakfast food and this is the place to be for the best breakfast! The pancakes are beyond amazing, the eggs are the fluffiest eggs I've ever had in my life, and the hot chocolate always hits the spot! Plus the service is great!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a real gem, from fresh squeezed orange juice squeezed when you order, to great pancakes and hash browns, they really have got an excellent breakfast! Menu has a good variety of items."}
{"text":"Wow, that wildberry french toast. Looks kinda strange but tastes really amazing. I thought they were better than the pancakes, but they're pretty similar. Definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast spot and I don't even live in AZ. Their service is impeccable and the menu is quite appealing. Can't go wrong with their skillets nor do their scramblers disappoint. The fresh OJ will provide you with your daily shot of Vitamin C."}
{"text":"Great service and yummy selection. You can get egg white dishes for 99 cents more. All egg or scrambles come with a side of grits /hash browns + toast or pancacks. Any type of pancake (2). You will not leave hungry!"}
