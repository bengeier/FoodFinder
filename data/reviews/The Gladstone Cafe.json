{"text":"The food here is surprisingly good and the portions are big. I recommend the bacon cheese burger with onion rings. The fish and chips are also one of my favourites however you must pay extra for tartar sauce as it isn't included (although it should be!). It definitely isn't the nicest place to eat, but since I live around the corner I usually just order for pick up. If you're in the area and have a hankering for some fish and chips or a decent burger at a reasonable price then definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"Ridiculous. I ordered 1lbs of wings and was excited because I got it to go and the carton felt heavy. When I get home and open it THERE WERE ONLY 6 CHICKENS WINGS. The reason why it was heavy is because there was mostly celery."}
{"text":"Don't let the sketchy exterior fool you, after living around here for awhile we finally ordered from here and we were very surprised to find the food very good. I had the Philly cheesesteak delivered and it was delicious and huge. That and a salad could have fed 2 people or more!"}
{"text":"Funny friendly staff. Poutine was delicious.. Husband got the philly cheese steak and loved it... And its open late at night!I would definitely go back for a quick meal."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere & delicious food. I got the Lobster Nachos & they we're some of the best I've ever had...& I eat alot of Nachos. Lol. The staff was nice but the patrons were even nicer. I'm from North Carolina & I've finally found a town with people more polite than my home. It's cute that they \"try\" to do BBQ tho. So presh. Bless their hearts.
If & when I return I will definitely be hitting up the Gladstone."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of those spots where the phrase \"no muss no fuss\" comes to mind. It kind of has a dive feel but is instantly welcoming and a comfortable place to go for a quick, cheap meal. The woman who works here is very friendly and kind. They aren't a place to expect gourmet good but everything they make is delicious and great comfort food."}
{"text":"Gladstone cafe is my spot. I'm giving it 5 stars not because the food will blow you away, but because for what it is (a diner, cheap lunch spot, drunk eats, breakfast on the go) it does it's job very, very well.

Honestly, the best thing about Gladstone cafe is the spicy fry poutine (or the spicy fries in general). They also make a mean ham & cheese sandwich. I stay away from the baked goods that have been sitting out (although they are made fresh daily) and I gravitate toward sandwiches, fries etc. The lettuce in my sandwhiches has always been fresh, the ingredients tasty and I'm happy with the combination.

Also the poutine here is better than poutini's ANY day.

Also, if service is important to you this might not be your place. Everyone is friendly but you order over the counter and wait 10-15 minutes for your order."}
{"text":"The interior isn't the nicest but the coffee is good and cheap. The cafe offers a lot of variety - sandwiches, wraps, bugers, cookies, pastries, muffins, etc. I want to come back to try their other items.  Their feta cheese fries sounds good."}
{"text":"Good Diner Grub. The Ethiopian Cook is Funny and Fantastic. The Vegan Burger is Delicious, it is a Potato Patty on a Whole Wheat Bun! the Onion Rings are dope, I recommend Mustard on those babies, try it seriously... it blows my mind. They also deliver!!!! ;) They deliver through a website, I think Just Eat or Grub Canada. I had delivery, it was fast and awesome! 

It is good old fashioned Spoon Food, the people are polite but don't kiss your hind quarters... I like that! 

Side Note, some semi-questionable charecters hang out in the shadows over there... take it easy, and keep an eye!"}
{"text":"I've biked by this place for years now, it didn't really stand out or look like anything special so never thought about eating there, but after seeing some positive reviews my family and I tried it out.

We all ordered different food, I got the cheddar burger, and the rest ordered philly cheese steak, fish and chips and pull pork sandwich,, there was no complaints and the portions were great,, my burger was amazing and filling. The fries are Ok nothing special, but we were all satisfied"}
{"text":"We dropped in here about 5pm on a Sunday, feeling a mite hungry.  Ordered burgers.  Took a while to get them (probably because they were made from scratch) but was impressed.  Huge (rather like the bowling-ball sized muffins they had available), juicy, tasty.  I also had a milkshake, great, not overly large (ok by me). Fries also excellent.   If you want to stay away from 'fast food' this is a great place to do it.  To my mind, this city is losing this type of 'independent' burger joint way too fast.  Hero, Acme, et al just aren't the same."}
{"text":"Well, I went to this 24 hour joint a few weeks ago after an event at the Gladstone Hotel.

The women working behind the counter sure seemed like they had been there for ages. They don't care about looking like the hipsters that were hanging. They got straight to the point and gave you what you asked sans cheery disposition. 

I went in with no expectations. So, when you want a cup of coffee without cares and any kind of pastry to chew on, well it ain`t bad.  In addition, to that they serve a rigmarole of food fillers. Soups, sandwiches, hot dogs etc.... Now throw in a cheap price and you'll be doing just fine,

So, if you are out on the west west side, you can't really go wrong here with something to just fill you up and warm your stomach while you be relaxing from whatever late night queen street west west event finished.  Don't expect a 5 star meal but say something better than a microwave sandwich from 7-11."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy. Nothing expensive. Nothing to complain about. What you see us what you get (and I mean that in a good way)."}
{"text":"The fish and chips here are surprisingly awesome.  They make them on the spot and so they are fresh and tasty.  Be warned though, they do take forever. I once had to wait close to an hour for mine. That is ridiculous, in my opinion, but once I tried the fish I forgot about the wait.

I usually go with the fish and chips but they also have a pretty good burger. I have yet to try any of their sandwiches but they look good.

Service is spotty, at best. Aside from the aforementioned long waits for food, they once charged me for my food, and while I was waiting said they made a mistake and asked me for an extra $6 bucks. I was like wtf. Turns out they were right but that is annoying. Get it right the first time!"}
{"text":"I got delivery from them through orderit.ca and it was very good.  The cheeseburger and poutine are excellent, and enough for two people, the portions are so large. My only suggestion is that they use a better bun for the cheeseburger.

The fish and chips are good too, though as someone else mentioned, they don't include tartar sauce (they give you the option of adding it for an extra 55 cents).  I just made my own.  Delivery was within a good time period, delivery driver was nice.  Definitely recommended."}
