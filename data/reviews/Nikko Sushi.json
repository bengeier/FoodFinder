{"text":"The house special combo was pretty good.  I really didn't like the green salad but everything else especially the miso soup was amazing.  The tempura and teiyaki chicken was nice.   The prices were good for this area."}
{"text":"Look, I'm not going to suggest that this is the very best sushi I've ever had. But for a neighbourhood, I-have-a-hankering-for-sushi-tonight kind of place, it's tough to beat. Strengths: Spicy tuna/salmon rolls are really good; miso soup is perhaps the best I've ever had. Weaknesses: Shrimp rolls are sometimes a little dey; sashimi is a little uneven. But the value is unbeatable. I wouldn't go out of your way for the place, but if you live in the area, you should absolutely give it a try."}
{"text":"I ordered from Nikko for delivery online and will only order sushi from this place from now on. They have a great menu with tonnes of high quality choices (the spicy butterfish maki is so good, as is the yam tempura). I ordered about $35 worth of food and they threw in an extra spicy salmon roll for free. Plus, they don't charge extra for delivery and the delivery guy was extremely friendly. Amazing."}
{"text":"These people are liars and scammers...Don't need to get into it but I wouldn't eat hear . They lie about what fish they gave u.  And charge u for fish that they didn't serve you.  There are a million sushi places in Toronto, eat at any of the others just not here... Nikko sushi if you're reading this , people aren't stupid and stop taking advantage of people.   ZERO STARS"}
{"text":"Good downtown prices uptown. The food was okay but good.   I have to say that this was one of the better miso soups I've ever had. Had lots of flavour and they put big chunks of seaweed and green onion.   We got a White butter Fish spicy roll with avocado and tobiko and tempura bits. It was different an quite yummy $6  The 15 piece sashimi wasn't the best. Although we got mostly salmon, some White fish, some mackerel and some tuna.  It was good but the cuts were strangely big. And some of it had not properly defrosted.   Don't go out of your way for this one but don't avoid it either."}
{"text":"Not a bad experience.  Food - 3 Service - 5 Value - 4  We stopped by for some late night sushi and miso soup and were not disappointed. The server was very friendly and sweet and very helpful, even though we were the only guests in the restaurant for a while. The sushi rolls were nothing spectacular if we're being honest,  but still fresh and yummy. I did expect a bit more out of my golden dragon roll, however. The inside of the roll was just a shrimp tempura which seemed a bit dry, it would've been great to have some avocado in there or something. The interior is actually quite nice, but the bathrooms could use some updating. Overall I can't say it was a bad experience, but nothing spectacular. Great spot for some late-evening Japanese food cravings and grabbing a quick bite for lunch, but it's nothing extraordinary."}
{"text":"first time and the last time... The fish is not fresh, fishy and not firm. I found a hair in the sushi, the sushi maker is totally home cook, not a professional sushi chef, the rice in the rolls is not even at all. My boyfriend end up had diaries right after we got home."}
{"text":"This is the first time I have written a review based on take-out/delivery and have not set foot in the establishment.  We have ordered from there twice, both using UberEats.  The first time was really good quality food delivered fresh.  The second time took two hours for delivery.  When my wife called to inquire about the status of our order after an hour and fifteen minutes, the person answering the phone stated \"Haven't even started it yet.  We are very busy.\" and hung up.  Yeah.  Plenty of raw fish in the sea folks."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE! This place is hands down the worst sushi place I have ever eaten at. I ordered the maki set & couldn't even eat half of it. I have never in my life not finished sushi but I had to through out the meal because it was so nasty, no flavour, weird texture, warm rice, It was just awful. The fish looked fresh but didn't taste it. Don't bother checking this place out, it's gross."}
{"text":"*Delivery Review*  This is our go-to delivery sushi place, and it always pulls through great. Prices are good, and food has always been solid. Delivery time varies, but that's to be expected. If you order directly with them over the phone, the delivery is free over $18 (before tax). With orders over $30 you get a free spicy salmon roll; orders over $60 you get both spicy salmon and spicy crab rolls free!"}
