{"text":"Better than average bar food.  BIG wine glasses.  My favorite place to gamble.  More machines than most bars & many have a progressive jackpot for royals."}
{"text":"BEST chicken fingers, fries and RANCH in LV!! Comfortable, clean and friendly!! We have NEVER been disappointed... top notch visit after visit!!"}
{"text":"might be able to one day consider more than a 1 star rating, but today, i just can not.  considering the great reputation that beckers has in vegas, this place should not even carry the name of beckers. cold, smokey, and not a comfortable place at all. so unappealing that we left before we ordered any food.  went to watch a football game, and needed binoculars.  not sure what their is, but it did not include me, that is for sure"}
{"text":"Things have improved quite a bit over time. Service,food and atmosphere much improved."}
{"text":"Clean fresh and friendly. The bar tender Angela was great. Good food and hot poker machines."}
{"text":"Yesterday 08/23/2016 4:00 pm I visited this place and the woman (bartender) was very unfriendly, unwelcome with us, bad attitude and bad service, she was saying stupid comments with other people, after drink only one beer I called her to pay and she was hitting my debit card against the border of the computer, the worst place to drink a beer in las vegas, it was my first and last time visiting this place"}
{"text":"Charlies has excellent food and service.  It has a great location at Durango and Sahara, and is a huge, clean, stand-alone building, beautifully landscaped in the front seen from the intersection.  The hitch is the parking lot and entrance at in the back, so it always looks closed or ignored from the busy corner.  After moving to the neighborhood and actively looking for good spots near our home we kept passing on Charlies since it never looked busy.  Fortunately we did make the chance stop-in and were delightfully surprised.   Charlies needs to either promote its assets of do something in front to tempt passers-by to go in and give it a shot. I've had their Steak & Eggs late a few times and it is the best inexpensive steak i have found anywhere.  All their food is well presented and good.   Charlies web site sucks however, that can't help, and their FB page looks hijacked."}
{"text":"The bar is cool, as the staff is a nice mix of class, and next generation professionals~ Pouring a good drink, or a cold beer in a nice glass~ Music is nice when they have it~ Not complicated, but comfortable enough to make you wanna grab a gal you have only noticed across the room for a box step to some Sinatra~ The food is Food Service, and not particularly spectacular.  I read some one describe the steak as \"good for reasonably priced\"~ Not something I could see eating twice on purpose~ So service is interesting, atmosphere less than threatening, and near some decent places for a meal~ And after reading the other batch of opinions, seems like the most complimentary thing past the service is \"Close to home\"~"}
{"text":"I just left lakeside charlies as an avid customer of 500 bucks a night because of the bartender telling me to not converse with the other customers. The time I was there was 5/11/2015 at 2:00 am.  I lost 400 bucks tipped him 10 bucks on 2 drinks and was told by him to shut up and mind my own business when I interjected on a conversation about MMA boxing.  The patrons that I interjected on were ok with my conversation but the bartender was not.  He made his point that he could care less about the 500 I put in the machines and through the loss I  still   tipped him 5 bucks a drink.  I also work for tips and could not dream of talking to a customer unprovoked like he did.  I have lived here 12 years and this is my very FIRST complaint on Yelp or anywhere that I would say this.  I liked this bar, but will NEVER come back as long as this guy works there.... Stay Away."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I order food here every Friday morning. When you work the graveyard shift there is nothing like delicious bar food to keep the over night shift alert and going. Chris, the bartender, is awesome and always has our order ready to be picked up, with extra ranch, which is always a plus."}
{"text":"Wife and I went for lunch (10 Jan 13), the place was empty except for a few workmen servicing the surveillance cameras. We ordered soup (chicken pot pie soup) and a club sandwich. The soup was very good...the sandwich was fair. Definitely  not 'piled high' with ingredients. The service was very good and the place is big and nicely decorated. One can sit at the bar or a seperate dining room for the kiddies."}
{"text":"Awful service.   Three servers, the two behind the bar are buddies up and seem to be having a good time while the one working the floor is sitting down and chit chatting with customers.  Guess I'll get my own food and drinks??"}
{"text":"Here is a place close to the house that we frequent more when the weather is warmer. They have a nice area outside to sit and relax. The food is decent enough but not all that special. There isn't a large menu but there is a bit of seafood or steak if that is your desire. The burgers are big and you can replace your fries with a nice chopped salad. The drinks are priced well below places like Applebee's or Chili's so enjoy one with your meal. Would I rave about this place? Clearly not but it is not like a dive bar so you can bring a lady without worry. Check it out and then come back and correct this review if you feel it is in error. You won't change my opinion but maybe someone else's and good luck  wit dat!!"}
{"text":"Best bartenders and management in town! Definitely stop in and visit here! Never an empty drink and they always take care of players. I always go here instead of the other dozen local dives that give borderline service at best... drink here first!  The food menu is great as well, try the garlic fries. Also breakfast is great! Excellent wait staff as well..we're big fans!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness!!!! Come see Wendy- best day ever. She knows everything about the menu and she is sassy. I love living in Lakes.... and Charlie's Lakeside is a secret hideaway.  Ask for Wendy!!!!!"}
{"text":"Used to go here all the time for dinner and weekend breakfast.  Then the restaurant stopped opening until 8:00 on the weekends...Seriously! People this is Vegas!  Decided to go back this morning. Sat 10 minutes this morning (Sunday 8/23/15 approximately 8:30) in the restaurant waiting for service.  The bartender knew we were there as she stopped talking on the phone long enough to say hi. After several minutes of no service I actually started my on phone timer.  With no further acknowledgement of our presence we got up to leave.  The bartender and what appeared to be the cook were at the end of the bar talking and laughing it up. They both observed us walking out and never even bothered to stop talking to ask us to stay or offer assistance. Used to be a  regular here.    Probably not going to bother your staff  again, there are  getting to be too many restaurants in the immediate area that actually seem to want our business."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here last night. The service was great and the food was good. I was a bit hesitant as I have a gluten allergy. They accommodated my needs and I did NOT get sick! It was also my husband's birthday. The waitress gave him a slice of cheesecake with a candle to take back to our room."}
{"text":"The service was good and our server was very nice. The food was good too. My only complaint is the place is dusty. The tops of the booths, light fixtures and silk plants were all dusty. I find that to be a turn off in a food establishment."}
{"text":"Terrible Customer Service!!! was on my way home from work at 1230pm when i stopped in here for something to eat. I walked inside the bartender completely ignored me so i thought i might need to go sit in the restaurant side to order food. There is a hostess podium but no one to seat you. The sign says no smoking. Nothing says to sest yourself. So i stood there wondering what i should do whike i looked over the menu. A guy kept starring at me from behind his laptop but said nothing. I waited for 10 mins for somone to say something to me or a hostess to show. Nothing. So i walked out. Obviously they don't want new business or any business at all here. Terrible customer service!!!!"}
{"text":"There are much better choices for food and video poker in the area.  The service we received was fine but the food was not as good or reasonably priced as some other local poker bars we have eaten at in the area."}
{"text":"Yep, I'm a Yelp regular here.  I attend my networking breakfast meetings here every Wednesday morning.  The breakfast is 4 out 5 and the service is tops!    If you live near The Lakes, definitely try it out. They say the burgers are pretty good but I haven't tried them yet."}
{"text":"I love this bar for Sunday afternoon football games! They are very accommodating to the games you want to watch. Friendly staff, Frankie always makes us feel at home. The food is good and fairly priced. My husband usually takes advantage of all day breakfast. Great locals joint."}
{"text":"When I'm looking for a nice quiet drink in a clean bar this is always the place I choose.   This is a place that I'd refer to as a bar for adults as opposed to those places where all those kids hang out.  Chances are you're not going to find a bunch of kids acting like they're having there first beer. If someone decides to have a shot you wont have to listen to all there friends yelling \"Shot, Shot, Shot, Shot\"  Good food, clean, good service. A class place!"}
{"text":"Came in from cali and fond this place next to my hotel.  Good price on drinks and food. Tried both and it was great. The best part of this place is everyone is very nice. I know we're I will be the next couple of days.   Light back ground music. Wait a minute, everyone at the bar is eating dinner. Just goes to say how great the food is.  Second night here. I had the French dip. No fat no grizzle. The best."}
{"text":"Very clean. Booth area is more upscale with high backs and comfortable cushions. Service is excellent. Food came out fast and was delicious.  Friends wanted to watch the game and could see it from the booth area too."}
{"text":"I'm not much of a gambler... so I won't consider that aspect as a part my review -- other than to say that they have a very loyal gambling clientele.  Charlie's offers great drinks... at reasonable prices... and has extremely friendly bartenders... and they are happy to serve you (even if you're not gambling).  Charlie's has a moderately priced dinner menu... typically with potato or rice (unless you will get your carb order from a pasta dish)... vegetable... includes soup or salad... the best waitresses around (they've been with them for many years) dinners are made to order...  Join me there some evening!"}
{"text":"I am local and this is only a block away.  I should have rated this a 4 due to one negative.  It has nothing to do with food quality or service.  It is due to the fact the dinning area is open to the bar and there is a smell of cigarette smoke in the eating area.  For some that will not be a concern or deterrent.    Their service, quality, and quantity added the additional star.  Aside from that the food is great.  At least breakfasts.  I am partial to steak & eggs.  As is a friend of mine.  We try to meet up on a weekly basis.  We have dined here several time this past month. (April 2017)  Update 12/2017 I have been coming here weekly since April.  They have a Steak and Egg special that comes in right at $10. ($9.99 to be exact). It comes with a large side of potatoes of choice, and toast of choice.  Their steak is not the run of the mill lower quality you might expect from a normal breakfast house.  Many times it ranks up there with a steak house quality serving of meat. Regardless, great value for the $.   Coffee is extra of course but priced at the bottom of the scale for what we pay at comparable places ($2.00).    Service is prompt, courteous, and attentive (Server: Wendy).   She knows what I always order.  I feel like I am getting small town friendly service.  Weekday Breakfast (8am) is rarely busy and rather quiet which makes it very attractive as a place to meet for breakfast and conversation.  I am not sure why they aren't packed.  In a way I hope this review doesn't lead to that.      No charge for parking in an ample sized parking lot.  This is one of the \"best quality for your $\" that you can find in the area."}
{"text":"I came here years ago and I admit the waitress was having an off day, but years ago the service here was awesome like the food, but between the service and food kinda going down hill I stopped coming here with my friends and family.   It's an ok place as a last resort if all places don't fit your style. I came here with my wife and we wanted to eat out and relax, it took the waitress 10 minutes to sit us, because she was assisting another customer which by standards is literally fine I love seeing that. What upset me was when we were seated it took another 10 minutes to get anything to drink, so when we ordered our drinks we were ready to order.  When we told her we were ready she stated she would be back to take our order.... 5 minutes later she returned and took our order. About 45 minutes to an hour is when we saw our food and it alright, but allot of things could of been better. Not bashing the company, but literally only maybe 5 or, so people were in the building and out of the 5 were 3 customers and the rest were staff.   Everyone's allowed to have an off day, but common that's the purpose of an individual having a day off to kick back relax and enjoy themselves while out, but to come here was more of annoyance than all else."}
{"text":"Oh my god!!! Just realized our favorite bartender Frankie just was let go!!! Previously we haven't been to this bar in probably ten years but since moving to this side of town 2 years ago and meeting Frankie and Ron  we were hooked again! What the heck is going on??? We would get killed on the machines every time we came in but these bartenders made it worth the beating!!  Ron retired (good for him) & now we find out Frankie is gone.....that is just plain stupid. I guess we have to find a new place again"}
{"text":"food is great!  i love the steak and eggs."}
{"text":"This place has deteriorated since I started going here a couple years ago. The entire building stinks like urinal cakes. Service is generally bad and the food is mediocre... Never going back."}
{"text":"WARNING! Had lunch there earlier this week by myself and paid the bill with my Amex. I have an app on my iPhone that sends me an alert every time a charge is posted to my credit card. I gave the waitress my Amex to pay for the meal and got the alert prior to her bringing me the receipt to sign. My phone alert showed that I was paying an automatic tip (before I even entered a tip amount and before I signed the receipt). They don't even show the tip amount that they are charging you on the credit card receipt, they leave this blank for you to fill in an amount for the tip. When I brought this to the waitress' attention she said it is a bit embarrassing the boss does this but I don't have to leave that large of a tip if I do not wish to (she said the system automatically charges a tip amount and closes out the transaction before the customer has a chance to sign off on the receipt). She said if I disagree with the tip amount then I can get the tip credited back to my card but I would have to call the owner. What a friggin scam!!!!!!!!!!! NEVER AGAIN WILL I RETURN TO THIS PLACE."}
{"text":"Haven't been here for about 10 yrs.  was on this side of town with some friends and decided to cruise by and watch the Cubs game.  Got some food, drinks and did some gambling.  Very chill atmosphere with good food and we all won at the machines.  The service was great too.  We will def be back!"}
{"text":"Charlies Lakeside is a great place. They have a quaint dining area with a fireplace that is romantic and cozy. The food is great and they have some unique items on the menu that I always know to go here for when I crave them. The service is great, I never wait and my drinks are always being refilled! Staff is fast and friendly with great dinner recommendations. Price is just right and specials are great deals.  Love coming here to meet my family for dinner or a nice romantic night with my boyfriend.  Highly recommended by me!!"}
{"text":"Crossing Charlie's Lakeside off my list. Online they show breakfast specials until 6am, so at 5am this morning we decide we will go out for breakfast. Get to Charlie's and tell the Bartender we would like the Bacon Egg special ($1.99) only to be told they no longer do breakfast specials.  Not only didn't they have specials any more but they had to make coffee. No wonder the place was empty."}
{"text":"This is the place to go for a great experience. As a local I love the feeling of a hidden gem and accommodate to all if you are lucky to find it. I first came here for a business meeting and 2 years ago and stopped by regularly for six months. After over a year later, they have only inproved. Good job guys."}
{"text":"I can guess why this place has 3 stars. Saturday, September 24 at 10:30pm. My significant other called to see what drink specials are going on. The guy on the phone said \"If you had to ask? You can't afford\". That was pretty harsh for him to say. It's ok, there food sucks anyway. I'm sure they don't care if they lose us as a customer. But I highly recommend it not going there. It's a waste a space :/. We'll just go to Blue Ox They always treat their customers with respect and friendly."}
{"text":"Pretty good service, the bartender and waitress were nice and attentive. We ordered chickens fingers and garlic fries, the fingers were standard but the fries were amazing! Great selection of flavored vodkas as well :)"}
{"text":"This review is based on their handling of a private event. I attended a dinner seminar here and the server was very nice but service wise, she failed tremendously. We had a big group that started to gather around 530 because the dinner was supposed to start at 6. She took a handful of people's orders, mine included, and before most of the group even showed those who ordered had their soup/salad already. It made it awkward while people were starting to arrive and we're there eating. Next she started to take orders from people, but it was scattered because not everyone who was sitting got to order, not even a drink. Once the presentation started our entrees arrived before other people could put their order in. Again, awkward. Before the presentation ended at least 45 mins later, than the rest (most) of the attendees got to order their food. One of my colleagues were missed completely and still ended up not getting his order because they forgot him AGAIN. I don't know about this place. The server should have alerted the manager if she couldn't handle it and the manager should have made an appearance midway to make sure all was good. Or at least peak in to make sure all was going well.  Food wise, it was ok. I had the salmon with mashed potatoes. The side house salad was presented very well."}
