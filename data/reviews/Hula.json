{"text":"Slowly but surely, I will try all the poke places in Calgary! Lucky for me, most of them are downtown (and +15 accessible!) so I can zip over during my lunch break.

What I like about Hula is that they have a list of their bowls or tostadas, you just pick your protein and which flavour you'd like and that's it!

Build your own bowls = long lines = extreme hanger
This is a tried, tested and true mathematical equation lol

I went with the Nikkei bowl which came with ahi tuna, avocado, grapefruit, red thai chili, togarashi sprinkle, crunchy peas, black sesame seeds all tossed in a wasabi lemon creama on a bed of rice and yuzu kale. All the flavours and textures worked really well together and I felt full and not lethargic after. I will however not get the red thai chilis because omg, they were super spicyyyyyyyy

Get here early, or else you'll have to deal with the dreaded lunch rush and long lines!"}
{"text":"Received a gift card and went to try Hula for the second time. Location is great, people are friendly. As mentioned before, it's super new so... there's a big learning curve. Service is nice, but I feel like they're scrambling a little bit. Food was good. Flavours are awesome and so different, but they could use more protein (I had maybe six or seven pieces of small tuna in mine). They don't use sushi rice, which was a surprise, but it complemented the sauces and toppings well. My friend and I went for lunch - ordered two poke bowls and two drinks (and two plantain chips) and and it came to close to $40. Not terrible but servings could be bigger, especially in comparison to places like Ola and Poke. 

Also, they forgot to give me my plantain chips the second time so.. I guess I'm not really having the best luck with them getting my orders right.

TL;DR: bad first experience, better second experience, but they have a lot of room for improvement. Go try it if you're a fan of poke and want something different."}
{"text":"I had tuna in Juzu sauce and my friend ordered the Koko for lunch. Both of us found it way too much salty! Nothing like what I had in Hawaii. The taste of the fish was covered by the sause. Although the portion is big. I skipped dinner not sure if I was so full or sick of the amount of sauce in the poke."}
{"text":"January often means jumping on the 'healthy' bandwagon and trying to eat foods that are good for you. That's why I was very happy to find Hula in the new Brookfield building. 

The servings are the perfect size for me personally but I could see them being a touch small for others. So far I've tried the Nikkei, Sweet Potato (with kelp noodles), and the Lei. They have all been delicious with a nice balance of textures and flavours. The plantain chips ($2) are also great - perfectly salted and just a touch spicy. The chips are in front of the cash so just grab a bag as you're ordering. 

The other nice thing about Hula is that most menu items are dairy and/or gluten friendly. I don't personally have allergies but I appreciate that the menu is allergy-friendly for days I don't feel like having dairy. 

The line can get kinda long but they are very efficient and it's worth the wait. My new favourite lunch spot in the core!"}
{"text":"My friend and I tried Hula Poke.  It's all right...nothing spectacular about it.  

Need more protein.  There was hardly any salmon in our bowls.  We are always on the lookout for healthy poke bowls but Hula missed the mark a bit with having no brown rice option, smaller portions of protein, way too much kale, not enough avocado, not enough sauce to coat all the white rice at the bottom, & the bowl is much smaller than most poke places in town which makes me wonder why the price is set at $11 or $12! 

Mind you, they do have different flavour options but it's sometimes nice to pick out what we want in the poke bowl as opposed to having a flavour already picked out for you.  I like their fancy utensils that are biodegradable. 

 I also do not like the atmosphere in that new Brookfield Place food court with all that loud squeaking chairs and tables rubbing against the shiny new marble floor.  Can someone do something about that?  

Also, my friend took her first bite of Lei Salmon and she bit into a bit of a rock!  She almost broke her teeth.  Sorry, Hula...maybe rethink your menu a bit."}
