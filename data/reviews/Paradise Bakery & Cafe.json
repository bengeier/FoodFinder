{"text":"Awesome place... Just upset they took my salmon salad off the menu.  No more fish at all and that's what I like to eat when I'm out.  Their cookies and acai berry drink are awesome!"}
{"text":"Place is always clean, good is always fresh and staff is always friendly.  A little pricey for sandwiches but they do come with a cookie and wifi!"}
{"text":"Meh,  the person who made my salad spent about 10 seconds making it, never asked me if I wanted anything else and just threw it up on the counter moving on to the next customer.   Like,  maybe I wanted some cranberries or sunflower seeds.... Maybe...? and Then I had to wait about another 10 minutes waiting to be rang up.  Ingredients quality is so so,.  Presentation abysmal and I'm pretty sure the Asian sesame dressing has aspartame in it.  No way could anything be that sweet without it.  I should have known better.  Just another chain store with all the mediocre service and food."}
{"text":"First off, I must state I am a HUGE fan of sandwich+soup meals! Now, with that said. I love this place! I always get the half soup, half sandwich. I usually get the tuna sandwich with their signature Fire Roasted Garlic Tomato soup(YUM)  and to top it all off, they always give you a free chocolate chip cookie.  The cookie itself deserves one whole star...maybe even two! It's an absolutely perfect crafted chocolate cookie! It's got a crunchy/crispy outside crust and the inside is still chewy/gooey! Perfection!  I've never tried a salad here but they seem to be quite popular and the ingredients look really fresh! But I'm not a huge salad person so I haven't actually ordered one myself...maybe one day"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and probably this is my new favorite restaurant. Cute decorations and very clean. Great customer service. The salad was amazing. The macaroni was heavenly. I recommend the chicken caesar salad and the macaroni. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"For starters I probably got the worlds most difficult cashier, she didnt pay attention to half of the order I made even though we paid for the whole order, when I reminded her of the mocha and scone she looked at me as if I were an insane person. The food was gross, the soup was good sisco soup and the mocha tasted like battery acid. Hands down the worst coffee I have ever tasted in my life, the scone was good. The cookie was terrible, too much oil and not baked long enough. I was surprised by how bad it actually was and I am usually excited about going to new bakeries I have not tried. I will NOT be going back."}
{"text":"Worst service I've received at a Paradise Bakery. Employees acted like they could care less. I asked for my points to be used and the cashier says \"they should show on the receipt or NOT!\" And then does nothing to check out the total. Thank goodness for the manager who stepped in and asked for my phone number so he could add them to my account. Time to train your staff on customer service and what it means to a returning guest."}
{"text":"Save your money. These people don't care. Orders are wrong. No real cream for coffee."}
{"text":"I typically like to stop here and get a sandwich but today, I purchased a Bacon Egg and Chese breakfast sandwich only to find out once I was airborne that it was only a Bacon and Egg Sandwich.  Really disappointing,that they could not get that right...  Additionally, a small round ring fried egg in a much rectangular hunk of sourdough roll?  Maybe the transition to Panera isn't a,good thing as the Panera quality I expect isnt there."}
{"text":"I always get a thai chicken salad when I come here and I always end up feeling like Goldilocks. Sometimes the salad bowl is hot (from being just washed?) and it makes the salad get wilty. Sometimes the chicken in the salad is ice cold (one time it was literally still frozen). However I keep coming back because when its good, that Thai salad is seriously good. Exhibit A, my empty salad bowl today."}
{"text":"Consistently good and fresh food.  Yummy chippers cookies.  Chicken salad sandwich is fantastic.    Drawbacks: don't move the line fast enough during rush and the parking in front with the horrible yellow disk that has to be validated is a nightmare...hard to navigate in a big car and always clogged up during the rush hours.  Dinging two stars for the parking catastrophe."}
{"text":"Their salads are delicious. According to one of the employees, the chili they have is a winter item only. Which is unfortunate. I don't care if it's 115 degrees, the chili is damn good and I would eat it."}
{"text":"Terrible. Bad employee attitudes and lack of team work. The poppyseed muffin was so hard it crumbled into crunchy pieces. Wasted money. Went to Starbucks for lemon pound cake. ..yummm"}
{"text":"nice place!just too packed at lunch time!"}
{"text":"I had a veggie sandwich.  The bread was fresh and it was pretty darn tastey.  Servers were very friendly and accomodating."}
{"text":"This Paradise Bakery location was permanently closed June 12 and will reopen June 29 as Panera Bread after renovation is complete."}
{"text":"The smoothies have me hooked!! Limited variety hurts the rating though. The cookies on the other hand completely make up for it."}
{"text":"We typically visit the Raintree location which is very consistent and excellent service.  This location does not even compare, we should have turned and left before even entering due to all the dirty dishes on the outside tables.  The employees were rude and impatient when we asked a question.  I watched an employee talking on her cell phone while preparing a meal ~ yuck.  We were not offered dinner rolls with our soup and the girl checking us out was not happy when we asked, even had to ask for butter.  We were able to find the only clean table in the place and couldn't wait to finish so we could get out of there never to return."}
{"text":"This is a great Paradise.  I love the size of the place.  Plus, on my first time here I was greeted by a friendly, enthusiastic lady.  And that's always nice.  The tea is good and it's an easy-to-get-to spot with good vibes, where you can have business meeting in the middle of the afternoon.  Haven't been here for breakfast, just drinks and meetings.  So on that criteria -- business meetings, tea / coffee, service -- are what I'm basing my rating on.  Plus-food-review coming soon..."}
{"text":"I've had several good business meetings here.  Really the only thing I've tried is the regular coffee, so I need to try the food and the smoothies.    Friendly staff and managers and a very roomy location with outdoor seating.  I'll be back regularly... It's nearly Paradise for coffee shops!  Plus I have a rewards card to use."}
{"text":"Food is always delicious relaxed atmosphere friendly people fast service nothing is forgotten orders come exactly as you order them family oriented everything is fresh crisp and delicious and the flavors are bold and you can taste it doesn't fade away never boring:)"}
{"text":"Bad food, bad service, bad tea (frequently out of hot water - WTF?), surprisingly good coffee however.  People go here strictly because it's the only sit-down diner-blech on the corner of 24th/Camelback. You could put a damn Target commissary here and people would go for meetings.  PB-Biltmore is laughably dirty with employees who clearly don't give a sh*t skulking around the sit-down area **eventually** bussing dirty tables and kind of wiping the table crumbs onto the chairs and seat cushions, which are ALWAYS full of food and sticky stuff.   I'm pretty sure the bathrooms here are the ONLY bathrooms in the Biltmore shopping center with gang etchings carved into the bathroom stalls and mirrors overlooking the sink. Management HAS TO see this on a daily basis, if they actually wash their hands...yet nothing is done to clean the defacement of property.  Paradise Bakery is the kind of place where a 20-something cashier will admonish you to \"Hold on\" if you're next in line and she or he has to step away to tend to other business, rather than the more-acceptable \"I'll be right with you\" or something to that extent.  The cookies and baked goods are Chips Ahoy quality. The main dining room is uncomfortable and cramped.  Seriously, this is BY FAR the worst \"food\" joint from 32nd to 24th and from Highland to Lincoln. It would be great to put a better local business in this spot that actually offered healthy and/or good food."}
{"text":"Man does this place get packed. I love that it has free wifi  Only reason it has bad ratings is bc it is a chain. Well all you people giving it bad ratings bc of that can enjoy your four dollar single cup of coffee while I take in my refillable humongous jug for less than 2 bucks."}
{"text":"Food was ok until I lifted up my roll and discovered a hair on my plate. Didn't eat the roll and won't be back. Yuck table was dirty too."}
{"text":"This place has decent food and it's not to terrible on price but it is staffed by idiots who don't know there own menu at all. Make sure to know what you want and give them very specific directions. While I was there I watched them mess up about one third of the orders that came in. Then the line goes slow because one out of three people comes back up to the counter to ask them to fix something."}
{"text":"As an Australian, I haven't had the chance to experience the Paradise Bakery Way before.  As a local bakery, I commend the business on the quality of the roasted turkey and avocado BLT that they prepared. The ingredients were tast and fresh and I will definitely be back to visit next time I am in the USA.  I also sampled the light roast coffee and was very impressed with the well rounded flavour. I'm a straight black coffee drinker without sugar and the coffee ticked all my boxes.  Would prefer if they filled my coffee cup rather than the DIY bar but that's probably just me being a snob.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I ordered the steak wrap bowl from the hidden menu...it's so hidden that I'm still looking for it. I get more meat when I get samples at the deli. It's my third bad experience at this place. I should have learned by now."}
{"text":"Just spoke with manager who offered to refund my $2 coffee. Would have left after waiting 10 min, but I gave a $.75 tip in the jar. Ordered 1 reg coffee and that was too much for this place to handle. Took 15 min. Place is filthy. Manager said, Well, I won't say what happened today...\" Whatever, there were 10 people in the place and lots of workers. Counter by coffee was not just disheveled, but dirty. Garbage on floor and in booths. Soda counter still not cleaned after 20 min sitting in a booth. I seriously would never eat a bite of food here. Manager- quit walking around looking busy and pick up a broom and rag. In a well run place, everyone chips in. Never again- many other choices in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Food is ok but the service at this particular Paradise is just sad. Highly disorganized with a lot employees that are either too stupid to figure stuff out or just don't care. Maybe both. I ordered and sat near the register with a front row seat on just how bad it was. The employees are like ants. They are everywhere but then when a customer walks in all 100 of them disappear into the back. Cashier needs to finish her tweet or whatever before looking up at anyone. Multiple employees have taken cell phone calls on the floor instead of cleaning anything. Really bizarre that it's this bad. The dining area looks like my old frat house. There are napkins and trash and the floors and the tables are a mess. I can't imagine what it looks like in the back. I'm a little concerned now that I ate this salad. Please pray for all of us eating here right now."}
{"text":"Today I was greeted and served by an employee with the name of Alex. He was very helpful in our needs for extra onions. He was very generous! Our salads were well mixed and fresh. I love this Paradise."}
{"text":"as a crew member always on the go, looking for a good, reasonably priced airport meal, PB is super!  make sure you purchase your meal before going through security and finish all your soda (3-1-1 ppl). if you forget to get it prior to security and have extra time, leave your bags with a friend and run over there.    i like the sandwiches, that come with a decent amount of meat. the soups are pretty good. sometimes they run out, but if you call ahead of time, they can run to the outside kitchen and bring some up for you. don't forget one of their awesome cookies for dessert. i'm a chocoholic, so i love the double chocolate decedent. there are tons to choose from."}
{"text":"I used to come here semi-regularly for lunch with my coworkers. Recently I came for lunch and had a to-go order for me and another coworker. When I got back to the office we realized that they had given me the wrong order and my coworker was given a soup without a lid (which obviously spilled all over the to go bag). I called and spoke with a manager who said she would refund the money, but she told me it would take 7-10 days. I called back two weeks later after not receiving anything and spoke with a different manager who apologized and said nothing could be done at this point, but that she would talk to the owner and get back to me in a few days. It's been a couple weeks now and I haven't  heard back from anyone. I will no longer eat there and I will also encourage my coworkers to avoid the place as the result of such poor customer service. Besides, there are plenty of other places around the Biltmore that have much better food anyways."}
{"text":"I always enjoy P B when at the airport.  Their courteous staff make every visit a pleasant one.  I thoroughly enjoy their cesar salads.  I always leave with a box of assorted cookies or chippers, naturally!!"}
{"text":"Went in on a slow night, could not get our order right. Had to pay extra because they screwed up. They were rude. It took forever to get our food. Never once were they willing to make things right. Lost out business for good."}
{"text":"Unless your going for coffee, bagel, cookies or a muffin.. avoid their food. My boyfriend and I tried the bolognese pasta and turkey/artichoke panini and it was awful. The bolognese was in a bowl with a roll placed on top, and the pasta was cold.. my boyfriend took it back and they stuck it into a microwave to reheat - the outcome was luke warm pasta and overly cooked unbearably hot roll. The turkey/ artichoke panini tasted like it was gross reheated chicken with no flavor. I will never be back for lunch or dinner at Paradise Bakery."}
{"text":"Very sad ... This place used to be sooo good but service and food quality levels are just not acceptable anymore. Biggest issue is with the management staff. They stand around and are no help at all. 10 people waiting for salads and one person making them while the manager is day dreaming staring out the window. Super frustrating! Then there is the food quality ... It seems like they are taking every short cut to save costs and the salads are just gross now. Cookies are now the only thing I would go back for. Switching to Cafe Zupas as a replacement."}
{"text":"Wandered in here during Spring Training when our hotel (where the breakfast buffet is free) had a long wait.  It was conveniently located right across the street.  When we arrived the place was packed with other baseball fans - so we got in line, ordered an omelette and a breakfast sandwich, along with oj and a mocha.  We took our number and sat down to wait.  After about fifteen minutes, and seeing others who were behind us in line get their food - we started to get a little nervous.  Lo and behold the manager, Susan, approached our table and asked if we were still waiting for food.  We told her we were, and she hurried off to find out what was up.  Pretty soon she returned with two complimentary scones and our money back for the hot food.  She promised it would be right up, and it was there in just a couple more minutes.  She came back by to apologize again, and be sure that everything was good.  The food here is okay - the scones were great, the hot food what you would expect from a breakfast bar atmosphere.  But everything was hot and fresh, and for the price it's a pretty good deal.  What gives them the extra ++ is the customer service.  We would have been happy with either a free treat, or even just an apology - but Susan went above and beyond on a day when the place was absolutely slammed with people.  We'll be heading back here in the future - if nothing else for the delicious scones and coffee!!"}
{"text":"Worst coffee I've ever had in my life. I asked for an iced decaf coffee and what I reviewed was extremely watered down and not appetizing in the least. Also their sugar cookie tasted like chalk."}
{"text":"Kind of cold, otherwise your typical Paradise Bakery. Delicious chicken Caesar salads."}
{"text":"Today I give Paradise Bakery A+ my points where not registering but there shift manager Mickey took care of it, and fast!  She exhibited great customer service today!  Thanks again!"}
{"text":"The kids meals are totally overpriced. My kids are super picky eaters. This severely limits where we can go as a family. All my son wants is a peanut butter and jam sandwich. Honestly he is happy if he can have two slices of bread with peanut butter on one side and jam on the other. 7 bucks for this at Paradise Bakery with one cookie and a juice box. Come on....give a family a break. That is ok for an adult combo but we are talking about two slices of bread and a tablespoon of PB and J. Wow...have to just keep on walking next time."}
{"text":"Salads/Sandwich's are decent/Good, Desserts are what makes them stand-out. The wait during rush hour (lunch) is a joke. Feel's like a grade school cafeteria line. Guys/Gals with there briefcases who need too much room and think there overly important. And the best part you ask? The parking lot is a cluster, And with this location being so busy you think Paradise would come to there senses and move to a more suitable/larger building. Also, only two stars because price wise should be cheaper IMO"}
{"text":"The food for the most part is the same but the portions are getting smaller (a kids fruit cup had 2 pieces of fruit) and prices seem to be going up..."}
{"text":"The food is ok but overpriced for the taste.  Also the staff is not very courteous and in the last two years I've gone from visiting the place every other day to going only once a every couple months because of its accessibility.  Really used to enjoy this place but the service and quality keeps going down."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I had a terrible experience at this Paradise bakery.Natalie and Val the two managers we're not even able to realize after I had been directed to go to 3 different people for two iced teas that's all I wanted was two large iced teas so after being directed to 3 different people I would have been better off if I would have stayed in the original line to purchase my iced teas....but once Natalie decided she wasn't going to wait on me at all I had to leave I did however speak to the general manager and he said the next time I was in the area to call first and he would be more than happy to wait on me in an appropriate & courteous manner... You would think with all the competition out there you could get customer service right Natalie."}
{"text":"Too busy even at 11, people hogging the tables from early morning.  Mostly getting their free refills and wifi.  Saw a guy there with almost a whole office setup at a booth.  I hope those breakfast muffin sales are worth it, I'm not going here anymore."}
{"text":"Had Mediterranean veggie sandwich, cheese and a lot of veggies. Order like that is simple to the point you can't judge how good of a place it's.   They have long menu for a bakery, quite the large seating and patio as well.  Not bad"}
{"text":"These seem to be everywhere in Arizona.  We got in just before closing and the staff were just milling around, no doubt waiting for the place to close up so that they could go home. So despite there being one more person in line, they only were taking orders from one person. Perhaps they had done their fair share of the work that day.  The sandwich was meaty and tasty albeit a cold sandwich. The cookie was pretty good but doesn't compare to the gooiness that you get when you check into a Doubletree hotel!  All in all, an average sandwich cafe that is super busy from the looks of other locations but is still basically like a fast food joint. -1 star for the less than stellar service."}
{"text":"Very good sandwiches and wonderful baked goods.  Absolutely the best bread I've ever tasted."}
{"text":"Okay, this review has nothing to do with the food - because it's always good at Paradise Bakery and Café - this has to do with the FREE WI-FI. This location is great for those of us that need a location that is Cool , has facilities, and lots of places to Plug in your lap tops.  You don't even need to buy anything to get the FREE WI-FI. Walk in, hang a right and there are plenty of sitting spots and most of those spots have wall outlets.. Sweeeeet.   Now, if the place is packed, walk right next door to the Book Store and use their WI-FI , and if the book store is full, StarBucks is just around the corner.   And this place is perfectly located right off the Loop 101 and Scottsdale Road. Oh, and the cookies are great..."}
{"text":"We attended a business session in Scottsdale that ordered lunch in for us, and it was from Paradise... the food was outstanding, DIFFERENT and fresh! So, when we went to the airport to fly home, we were thrilled to see they had a restaurant in the terminal! The service here was outstanding! Best smiles in the airport! Great food, great cookies, reasonable prices! I sat and ate next to Starbucks and kept telling people to put down the ready made food from Starbucks and eat at Paradise! Can't wait to travel back to Scottsdale and eat there again! Unless they want to open one in my town!?!? :o)"}
{"text":"Good reliable lunch place, fresh salads, good sandwiches, and great tea."}
{"text":"This is the worst location...We ordered food for myself and three children. My youngest son's chicken tortolini Alfredo was still frozen in the middle.  When I asked for it to be corrected the girl handing out orders, Ruth, threw it in the microwave for which seemed like an eternity.  When she finally got it out she put her finger in the food and the whole container was melted and I was told it was a little hot.  Seriously, I then asked to talk with a manager and  I was told to walk over there if I wanted to talk with her.  I demanded that Ruth be fired on the spot and I was told by the manager she has to deal with these kids acting this way on a daily basis.  Really that is not acceptable she needs to be FIRED.  I have been calling the corporate office for 3 weeks with no reply from the owner of this location.  Everyone needs to know about this service and not eat at these so called restaurants."}
{"text":"I used to love coming here, but it's really gone downhill. It isn't clean. An employee stood on a chair with his dirty boots to load the ice machine and just slid the chair back to its table without wiping it off. Yuck. There was crud all over the floor. They need new leadership!"}
{"text":"I have heard so many good things about Paradise Bakery and was looking forward to trying this supposed \"AWESOME\" place, well.......  So we arrived early afternoon on a Sunday and the place was almost empty--only 4 tables were occupied.  Since I was a PB virgin, I was not sure how the ordering system worked and the staff was not very helpful (I guess they assume everyone is a return customer.)  We ordered our sandwiches, asked for a cup of soup and a cup of  fruit, were given cups for our drinks and sat down.  Our meal came out within a short period of time---nice!  However, I have to say, the sandwiches were just okay---nothing, I mean NOTHING special.  The taste was okay, but I expected SO MUCH MORE- --certainly NOT gourment sandwiches!   After spending $30.00 on 2 sandwiches, 2 sides and 2 drinks, I feel my time, energy, oh, and not to mention my money  were wasted---but at least I can say that I am not a Paradise virgin any more.....(maybe the bakery items are worth the trip??)"}
{"text":"I was looking for a place with wireless and good coffee. I found it.  I don't really get into all of the baked goods. I like a simple cup of coffee and maybe a bagel. They are good for that."}
{"text":"Consistent quality across all locations. Usually buy a dozen cookies to bring home to my family when I'm traveling.   Tonight the entire staff is one of the grumpiest I've ever come across. Too bad. Hope they can get it together. No reason to treat people poorly."}
{"text":"The Asiago steak sandwich was skimpy & ice cold, including the steak. I don't know about you but I hate cold steak fat. There was hardly any dressing on the roll so it was very dry & there was only 1 - 2 inch piece of onion on it, I later found out from the manager that 2 small pieces is the normal amount, I was dumb struck. Don't expect any Asiago cheese flavor on the Asiago steak sandwich because the cheese is sprinkled on the roll not in the sandwich & the cheddar cheese that was in it overpowered everything. The sandwiches should be made in front of you so you can see what's going on your sandwich & that way you can ask for more onions or dressing or WARMTH. The way they make it now is on a back counter with their backs to you & you can't tell what they're putting on it. The salads that we ordered were good, I got the blue cheese crumbles salad & my husband got the Greek salad, my only problem was that the dressing on mine tasted like a Dijon mayo & I expected blue cheese. They should display the dressings with name tags so you can pick your own dressing to your taste. I brought our sandwiches back to the restaurant & the manager was very nice & exchanged one sandwich for the Chicken Walnut which was good & another sandwich for the Broccoli Cheese Soup which was nice & hot & very good. I expected the cookie that came with the food to be warm when I sampled it in the car but, alas, it was not. I was sad, there's nothing like warm cookie to cheer you. I thought Paradise Bakery was overpriced for what you get & since I noticed a nickel tip on one of the tables I suspect someone else did too."}
{"text":"This is an update to my previous review. I had taken the Paradise online survey expressing my dissatisfaction and asked for a call back. I received an extremely rude voice mail to the effect of \"You asked for a call and this is it.\" No name, number or sorry. You need to avoid this location at all costs."}
{"text":"It took 20 minutes to get my order AFTER the lunch hour and it still wasn't right!  The person taking the order didn't know what she was talking about and the cashier couldn't ring up a \"pic 2\" order.  I got overcharged after trying to explain for 15 minutes what I ordered.  After returning back to my office with lunch the salads had huge center pieces from the lettuce...no quality control at this location.  Completely frustrating!!!!  For the prices they charge at least get it right"}
{"text":"I used to love the Turkey Cranberry sandwich.  It has changed for the worse.  Now just a couple of crappy slices of turkey that look like something from the back of my fridge.  The cookie quality has declined as well."}
{"text":"I used to love the Turkey Cranberry sandwich.  It has changed for the worse.  Now just a couple of crappy slices of turkey that look like something from the back of my fridge.  The cookie quality has declined as well."}
{"text":"Bad service, food quality not consistant.  I used to get breakfast at this particular Paradise, but I have had consistantly bad service for the last couple times.  I walked in a couple weeks ago and there were 3 customers waiting to order and no one behind the counter.  I waited 5 minutes and there was still no one at the counter so I left.  Sometimes the food was good sometimes it was very disappointing.  I give up on Paradise.  Too many other places with much better food and service."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good and definitely worth a visit if you have to eat in the airport"}
{"text":"I've frequented PB&C for a few years now. I am a coffee fiend and do enjoy their java. As far as food goes, though, the last couple meals I've had have been disappointing. And I'll admit, part of the reason for my last visit was to get the cookie that comes with the meal. I didn't get it.  I prefer Wildflower Bread Company's food. Fresher ingredients, and just better all around. But for baked goods, PB&C does it right. I love their banana and chocolate chip muffin."}
{"text":"This place obviously needs new management or something. I placed a call in order at 8 pm on a Tuesday evening (they close at 9.) The girl who answered to take my order said \"Hello?\" as a greeting leaving me to wonder if it was the business I was meaning to reach which it turned out it was. She took my order and told me it would be 10 minutes. I ordered the grilled cheese sandwich and a cup of chicken noodle soup. I arrived 20 minutes later and the girl yelled over to the soup line that she needed a cup of chicken noodle soup for my order. The women at the line were already shutting it down 45 minutes before closing and all of them rolled their eyes and seemed very irritated that I needed soup for my order. I was planning on sampling the tomato soup as well because it sounded good but seeing their reactions I felt very uncomfortable asking so I didn't. I paid over $12!!!!. The soup was definitely bottom of the barrel almost all broth and the sandwich was mostly bread, with one slice of cheese slapped in the middle which covered about 2/3 of the bread. HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE from beginning to end. I will not be returning to this location which is sad because I generally love the food and go to the location in Mesa at Dana Park that is by my work at least a couple times a week for lunch. This location is blocks from my house and I was excited to find a location so near to home. For some broth and a couple pieces of bread lightly toasted I should not be paying over $12! Paradise Bakery as a whole I would recommend; this location I would not."}
{"text":"Quite simply - this was some of the worst food I have ever consumed. The steak and white cheddar panini was inedible and the mac n cheese was disgusting. There was no line, but for whatever reason, it took around 10 minutes for our order to be taken. Once we gave them our order, the employee stood there almost as if he had no idea where to start preparing our order. Had I known there was a Wendy's farther down the terminal, I would have just gone there instead. Save yourself from spending money on overpriced sandwiches. Do not eat here."}
{"text":"The food is all right and a good location you do have to watch and make sure they get the order right when you do they are fine. However at times they can be slow and you have to wait. When you come in for lunch you have a limited amount of time and they don't seem to respect that. They need to step up the speed of their service and we should not have to feel like we are supervising children to get an order accurate. Mistakes can happen but it is too many times here."}
{"text":"Before hitting a movie at Tempe Marketplace, I finally caved in and ate at Paradise.. My previous experiences were just cookies at various locations.   I decided to go with the Paradise club (ham, turkey, bacon, lettuce tomato) served on a croissant. The meal was good and I left satisfied (not easy to do). Each sandwich comes with a cookie for $6.95. You can order a combo meal (drink/chips) for $1.99 more.  Not in the mood for a sandwich, there are wraps, salads, soups, panini's to choose.   While I enjoyed my sandwich and will eat here again, I still feel that Dilly's and Wildflower's sandwiches are better.  The cookies are amazing, especially the chocolate chip-5 stars for the cookies!"}
{"text":"So we have ordered from Paradise Bakery many times in one of our other offices and never had an issue.  But this one... WOW ... what a lousy customer service experience. In particular from \"Leanne\".  All we tried to do was order office sandwiches for delivery, and you would have thought we asked her to buy them for us and walk them across town.  We even told her we would pick them up.  Rude, abrupt and definitely not the service I have experienced at other locations.  I can see why their reviews are marginal at best.  It appears I am not the only one."}
{"text":"Though usually very busy, this place is always pretty fast and accurate. Almost everyone who works here is very efficient and in a good mood, and they're quick to let you know about specials that could save you money... not make them more."}
{"text":"Fabulous. I love their cookies of course, but their salads and soups are great. The bread is perfect. Everyone at my work eats here at some point during the week for lunch. It's just a staple at this point!"}
{"text":"This place is consistently good, like all the Paradise locations and man do they do a LOT of business and handle it all seamlessly.  Perfect place to grab lunch before you catch your plane."}
{"text":"We always get our Chicken Walnut Sandwiches on sourdough - mmmmm.  This is the best Paradise for service and consistent food quality.  I don't know if it is because they are so busy or because this is their training location.  The only thing we don't like is, they continually treat us like we are newbies, even when we hand them a Paradise Frequent Customer card (It gets tiring to continually tell them \"yes, we know our order comes with cookies but we would still like to order extra cookies\").  Even when the line appears long, they move it along very quickly."}
{"text":"I'm one of two sandwiches you have to make, and your sandwich \"assembler\" is standing there playing with the bread for the first sandwich, talking to her coworker for 5 minutes!! 15 minutes have passed and I still don't have my overpriced sandwich. Over half of my lunch break is over before I ask for a refund.   The service at this location is the slowest and least customer oriented.  The female manager on multiple occasions has complained about the customers to me while messing up my orders.  It's just super unprofessional and dissappointing."}
{"text":"On a lunch break (approx15min) I ordered pasta and a half sandwich. 12 minutes later as my order was called out, one of the staff informed me that they have been out of pasta all day. She was empathetic and offered to make me something else . when my frustration got the better of me, I just asked to be refunded so I could return to work on time. The asst. mgr was prompt in refunding  me, but this is where I almost lost my s**t. Without picking his head up to look me in the eye he stated with a nervous laugh \"I dont know why they messed up everyone knows that we have been out of pasta all day..hahahaha\".  The apology was sardonic in tone and there was 0 f**ks given to ensure I was a repeat consumer. It was just an experience that left me with disdain and empathy for the store manager who truly cares in the brand and the  belief that service;  above all is why consumers become repeat buyers."}
{"text":"Attention travelers:  choose wisely before boarding!  My attempt at a healthy quick meal for my fight was a mess.  The turkey cranberry seemed wise healthy choice until I was covered in sticky cranberry sauce and tomato goo in my cramped seat.  The leaky coffee cup didn't help.  Neither did the cookie wasted on someone trying to make healthy choices.  Just please bring back at least one fast food joint in each terminal!  It's not healthy, but it's fast and easy to deal with.  These local places are you expensive and not travel worthy.  And high sodium processed turkey lunchmeat isn't healthy anyway."}
{"text":"Walk in for a quick grab and go. The place is empty, has three employees.   I felt like I have just walked into an adolescent camp; a taller/older kid with heavy make-up trying show off by being snotty and mouthy in front of the smaller/younger kids.   The taller female individual grudgingly says hi and asked what I would like. I don't frequent this franchise so I am trying to quickly assess their menu options. Hoping the kid is willing to offer some suggestions, I asked if they had a salad and sandwich combo to which her reply was \"uuuuuhhhh yeah\" in the tone of \"uhhhh duhhhh\". With no guidance from her, I just decide to go with the Mediterranean Salad and Mediterranean sandwich. The two kids in the back look on, not sure if they were in disbelief to her attitude or if they were waiting to see if I was going to react to her snotty attitude.   I proceed to the check out where she goes through the standard pitch for added drink etc..then she asked if I was a member. I can't remember when was the last time I ate a Paradise Bakery, so I asked her if this would be my phone number? I get an eye roll and then another \"uhhhhh yeahhhhhh\". She took notice of the app on my phone that has the Yelp logo and then she changes her tone to an overly sweet non-sincere, \"Thank you for...\"   The kid behind the counter working the salad station brought over a small box and places it in front of me and said, \"here's your salad\"... no bag, no fork, no napkins, no sandwich.   I wait for the other kid in the back making my sandwich. She seemed like she was not into the shenanigans the other two were playing, but she stayed quiet. I go back up to the counter to pick up my sandwich. The younger girl placed my sandwich in a bag but again, no napkins, no fork...   Go back up to the older kid and asked her for utensils...\"her response was \"what exactly would you like?\" A fork would have been nice. I looked for her name and she had flipped her badge over so it just showed a blank badge.   I get to work and look at my food. UHHHHHGGGG. There were literally three tiny scraps of chicken in my Mediterranean Chicken Sandwich and the flat bread that was folded over it must have been the oldest price of flat bread they could have found, The flat bread was like a cracker dry and brittle. The salad was foul- I couldn't even take the time to figure out what was wrong, it was just wrong. Yuck! I am not certain if it was made particularly awful just for me, or if this in fact what it is supposed to be like.   I hope that when my kids are old enough to work, that they display good manners and respect for the people that are providing them with a pay check. If I was the parent of these individuals, I would truly be embarrassed by their behavior."}
{"text":"I love there food, so rich and full of flavor.  They have this \"pick two\" idea on the menu.  You get two items of your choosing with half potion sizes and a warm cookie. They have soups, salads,  and sandwiches.  It's quite and relaxing to eat here in doors or outside.  I would also like to mention the coffee.  In a word, amazing.  I would also like to comment on an earlier post a young lady posted.  No where on their pick two menu says it's for $6.  You gave an incorrect review because you didn't take the time to read.."}
{"text":"I ordered the Chicken Hummus salad most recently and it was delicious, even after four hours sitting in the to-go box!  I am always impressed by the staff; they are always kind and helpful."}
{"text":"This specific location, service was poor, establishment was dirty, carpets looked dingy.  Not appealing. They need to make some significant changes."}
{"text":"Most disgusting mocha ever. Tasted really burnt.  No soy either...almond option only. Line was out the door, so I had high expectations. Very disappointed. Should have gone to the other place next door."}
{"text":"Well ladies and gents the paradise bakery story goes back at least 7 years where the real name Panera made generous portions and were customer health conscientious.  They used to ask you if you wanted chips or apple with your sandwich and now you get the generic bun.  Food is from scratch but they have cut back from almost everything.  This includes the sauce they spread to items.  Over the years, I've seen sandwich size getting smaller and price going up to service dwindling.  On our last visit, we've ordered half sandwich and soup.  My wife asked that if she can have a chip instead of the bread but was rudely turned down.   Where is the old Paradise/Panera bakery?  When you start losing customers maybe you will realize that making portion cuts, quality cuts you realize that you will also cut the foot traffic."}
{"text":"I spent 4 hours in Paradise Bakery today working on my business plan and doing research.  Oh yeah, and I ate some dinner there too.  I had the you pick two.  I had half of the Paradise Club and a salad that I was able to create along with a Mango Passion Iced Tea.  It was so great!  I received a chocolate chip cookie on the side also.  About 2.5 hours into working on their free wifi, I tried their Roasted Tomato Soup, which was lovely.  I will definitely come back when it is time for a long afternoon of research along with a bite to eat."}
{"text":"On May 26th at about 1030AM 4 of us bought Sandwiches before boarding a flight to Seattle for an Alaskan Cruise. Since it was a 3 hour flight we thought we would eat the sandwiches on the plane.  Couple #1 opened theirs before boarding and the sandwiches were totally soggy and bread slices with big holes in them. They returned them. Got a refund. Sandwich was disgusting! Mine did not seem as bad but discovered the wet bread was from wet lettuce. I had a turkey sandwich fellow traveler had turkey cranberry. Landed in Seattle 2 1/2 hours later and I had FOOD POISENING. Extremely nauseous and actually slept for 16 hours and could not eat a thing. What a rotten start to a Cruise. This was a nightmare experience as I was sick for 2 days. I am still thinking of contacting an Attorney as your restaurant at Terminal 2 should be shut down.!!!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible food, terrible service.  The employees were rude.  Most of them wouldn't make eye contact so they didn't have to take your order.  Ordered a veggie omelette.  All I ate was the \"toast\" which was not toasted at all and cold.  Will NEVER go there again."}
{"text":"Lovely food. I am also happy to eat at this location of paradise bakery.. they have fresh ingredients and make good alterations if asked for. Great for vegetarians and well as non vegetarians. Fact that this location is in tempe marketplace, makes a high difference so we can enjoy outdoor seating in evenings."}
{"text":"Great location and never disappoints.   The staff are always happy and clean in appearance.  This goes a long way in the experience. The food was fresh!!  Kudos to the Manager."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places to eat. We come almost everyday to eat or dinner.  The people that work here are so nice all the time; we just love here food coz is so clean, fresh and quick.  We totally recommend this place"}
{"text":"Good breakfest and coffee.  Their cookies are always fresh and delicious.  Always very clean.  Free WiFi."}
{"text":"I love the cookies!   Especially the coconut chocolate chip.  I love the chicken, artichoke panini and the southwest salad."}
{"text":"Terrible service average food, make sure you have two or three things in mind to order they rarely have the first thing you want"}
{"text":"Slowwwwww. Took 20 minutes for them to make me a cold turkey sandwich, and the place was not busy by any stretch of the imagination. I counted 13 working employees...half of them were just standing there playing with their phones and gossiping the entire time I stood there waiting for someone to put some turkey between two pieces of bread for me. So if you're in a hurry, (but who ever is when in an airport, right?), probably not the place to go."}
{"text":"I gave 3stars because the food is great but the service is wack!  I'm from Chicago-love Panera Bread; so when I learned Paradise Bakery was owned by Panera I figured I'd give it a try.  The place was packed (we went at lunch rush). No one told us that you had to go to eat counter to order(bakery, sandwich, salad & soup). So we stood in line only to be told we were in the wrong line. Once we got to the salad counter, I told the girl I wanted the Greek salad; she corrected- \"you mean the Mediterranean salad?\" I told her \"no, the Greek salad-the one thats on the menu.\" Although its \"the same\" i didn't appreciate that she tried to correct me. No one asked if we wanted soup so when we got to the soup counter no one was standing there so we asked a salad girl for soup and she told us the wait. We did....a cashier got it for us. The other cashier who rang us out was so impatient.  She rang me up and told me the total. I told her my order wasn't complete I was waiting on my husband's food. She rolls her eyes and tells me to step to the side.  Two days later I went bake to get one bagel.  As I walked in the pastry girl was ringing out someone then walked away. As I stood there I asked the sandwich guy if he cud get me a bagel or if I had to wait for the girl to cone back-he told me I had to wait. Their were no other ppl in line so I was ticked. As the sandwich guy stood there waiting for ppl in the sandwich..I watched as the pastry girl walked slowly over scratching her ears. She gets to the counter and tell her what I want, but asked for her to wash her hands again.  She did. By the time she bagged my one bagel more ppl came in, so I was now the 7th person in line...she handed me my bag and began walking away. I called out can you ring me out over here?  She turns around and says sure. Question why did I have to ask for her to ring me up if I told her i only wanted one bagel?  Didn't like the ppl. Food was good. Wont be going back to this location"}
{"text":"the food was good. but the customer service was terrible! I went there for lunch and the girl who took my order acted as if I bugging her by me placing my order. then I went to pay after my food was made and another girl was mad that I asked her to put my phone number in since I'm apart of there loyalty program. they made my experience terrible maybe they should learn how to smile."}
{"text":"2 stars cause they got rid of my fav panini the turkey artichoke!!!!! So I asked for what would be close to it. The lady said chicken frontenga. It was cold!!!! This has turned me away from paradise. I don't think I will be going there any time soon"}
{"text":"Never got around to adding my review.  What great tastes and wholesome food in a clean place for a great price. *****"}
{"text":"Great menu... But that is where it ends. Orders taken in disorganized manner. Not taken by order in line but instead back to front so the people who have been in line waiting towards the front get their food last although they have been waiting the longest.  They have 1 cashier, 1 cook and the person who takes orders and makes all drink.  Place functions disorganized and inefficient. The food is cold."}
{"text":"Nope, no.  Bring back Paradise Bakery please!   It's edible but not nearly as enjoyable.  Soups aren't as good.  Sandwiches aren't as good.  Croissants are gone.  White chocolate macadamia cookies are gone.  No more cookies with your meal."}
{"text":"pretty good food for an airport cafe.  Even had organic apple juice, although it was $2.40 for a little juice box.  The bagel was toasted perfectly.  Staff were very friendly and courteous."}
{"text":"Good service! Food is always great! And the staff is vey friendly!"}
{"text":"LOVED this place.  Was the only place in Sky Harbor I could find that had a good selection of soups, sandwiches and salads.  The salad I ordered (the one with Craisins in it) was a bit too drenched for my taste with the dressing--would advise getting the dressing on the side.  Also, I ordered a tuna sandwich on wheat...YUM!  Very fresh bread and the tuna was not too oily nor too dry.  The chocolate chip cookie I actually ate a day later (very unlike me not to devour it in one sitting!) and it was still deliciously fresh and full of flavor.   Lastly, I wish there was a Paradise Bakery in Nor Cal...but sadly the nearest is probably Long Beach!!  Great first experience =)"}
{"text":"Has to be one of the driest sandwiches ever. Also it comes with one peperchini for each side I'm mean come on really?"}
{"text":"Not Paradise Bakery anymore. Same prices as before but no more cookies with the meal. And previous rewards points are worthless now unless you have enough for a free meal. Guess this is the last time I come here."}
{"text":"Cookies are pretty good. Awesome service and the best part a FREE cookie with an entree and 1+1 offer on that!"}
{"text":"I normally enjoy Paradise Bakery, but maybe this place is too busy to get orders right. It seems the last couple of times I have been in here the clerks are too frazzled to listen to requests, such as \"no lettuce\" and switch out the molllasses bread for whole wheat\". I have been to other locations around the valley - unfortunatley the scottsdale gainey location is no longer there. Generally an enjoyable experience - but after three times not getting it right,I guess I am not going back to the camelback location."}
{"text":"Big fan of their SW Chicken Caesar salad and fire roasted tomato soup. My favorite sandwiches are the chicken panini, the turkey cranberry, and the teriyakki chicken wrap. I love both wildflower and Paradise but Paradise Bakery has the best cookies. And although I do not get it very often because its a killer in calories, the chocolate cheesecake brownie is to die for!"}
{"text":"Been waiting in line. No one is tending the cash register because she is busy chit chatting with coworkers, calling them dumb out loud! Maybe that's why the customer ahead of me caller her dumb! Very unprofessional!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I got there about 5 minutes after 11. I didn't realize breakfast service stopped at 11. When I placed my order the manager offered to turn the grill back on an make my sandwich. Great service and the food was good as well."}
{"text":"A little annoyed with this place. I checked when they closed to see if I could make it in time and I got here at 8:50pm when they close at 9pm and the doors were already locked. I called them to see if I could quickly buy something (only wanted to buy a chocolate chip cookie) and no one picked up. Basically very disappointed with the customer service and I will be finding somewhere else to buy the odd cookie. You just can't close early on Shrove Tuesday... All I wanted was one last indulgence before lent."}
{"text":"First rate sandwich and breakfast place. Good value sandwiches, each coming with a great fresh chocolate chip cookie! Limited breakfast items. But good breakfast sandwiches and pastries. Self serve. Fast . Great."}
{"text":"beautiful and clean.  its a chain restaurant...i eat lunch here 2 X per week.  food is consistently good...but a tad over priced.  It is not so expensive to stop my visits. service is always professional and nice.  they arent your bff...they are there to serve you with friendly professionalism.  i love it.  my only complaint is the terrible9 muzak...this is the only place i frequent which has true elevator music.  other than that...great job!"}
{"text":"Michael is amazing! He is very nice fast and efficient! The food was good and cookies are amazing!"}
{"text":"I ordered an avocado and turkey sandwich at the Paradise Bakery in terminal 2. In mid-air as I was eating my sandwich a piece of curly black hair came out of it. I have never had this experience at a Paradise Bakery before. It was really gross."}
{"text":"I am visiting from Seattle and I love this place. The salads are outstanding and the steal cut oatmeal is one of my favorities.  Besides, this is one of the few places offering caffeine free diet coke ;-)"}
{"text":"The food is generally good. Good choices on sandwiches and salads. You have to watch though when busy (eg. lunch). They take your order and you wait. And now two times in a row the order is messed up. You need to watch orders as they get overwhelmed."}
{"text":"Good oatmeal. Kiosk system worked. My food was ready fairly quickly despite being crowded. Employee Jaimie Potts was troubleshooting out front and was doing a great job. It's amazing to see an airport restaurant employee who is engaged in the satisfaction of customers. Other employees were working hard. I hope they can keep up the good service."}
{"text":"It would be difficult to find something on their menu you won't like. Also a great place to meet for a business coffee."}
{"text":"had lunch there with the sis last weekend and it was CRAZY busy but still yummy! I loved my cookie and sammy... however they got my salad screwed up :( oh well next time I guess... but i\"m still a fan and will return again! :D oh and if ur wanting a nice lesirely lunch with the girls on a weekend afternoon... tough luck!! Cuz it was PACKED in there!!"}
{"text":"I prefer paradise over panera even though panera owns paradise now. I like this spot but the only set back is the line does not move, if you're not ordering a salad skip it and move over, if you're ready to pay go to a cashier. It would help if the customers listened to the  workers as they would say after you order, are you getting this, \"no\",  then skip it and go to the next counter. #keepthelinemoving you'll get more money in the sceme of it all."}
{"text":"Skip PB and try True Food instead!  Too bad biltmore only has one fast casual restaurant and this is it.  All the nicer restaurants are excellent yet paradise bakery fails time and time again.  I stopped in for a quick sandwich and the employee didn't make eye contact,  I asked what the price difference is for a whole or half sandwich. She said a \"half is the price posted and a whole is $1 less.\"  Obviously that did not make sense... I just ordered a tomato mozzarella panini.  Took my ticket to the cashier, ok same girl. Rang me up no issues.  I did see a fly right by the cookies which aren't even inside a case.  As I stand and wait finally the sandwich maker guy asks me if in waiting for an order.  I said tomato mozzarella panini and then he asks half?  I'm like no a full...  So I see him make it in front of me. The sandwich itself has melted mozzarella and marinara sauce with fresh tomatoes.  The marinara was slightly weird though I can see why it would need the sauce.  The bread was heavily heavily buttered.  Of course it tasted great and smelled really great but that butter was really heavy plus the marinara.  Not getting that again!  I've had the breakfast power sandwich on a asiago bagel which I greatly recommend.    For lunch skip this place and go to cpk, zinburger, or true foods!!"}
{"text":"There was a serious lack of personality, and polite customer service in our past visit.   The cashier didn't bother with a hello or good morning, just a what can I get for you.  Ok, fine, whatever, but we hadn't even looked at the menu yet.  When the bf and I were discussing with each other what we were thinking of ordering, eager beaver cashier girl took that as us talking to her and started trying to ring things in... mind you, we were a good 5 ft away from the counter, facing each other and using our \"library voices\".  Obnoxious!  They also had the lines laid out differently and forced you to walk through people sitting trying to eat at the high tops in order to get to your order and drinks. Very awkward.  My egg white sandwich was supposed to have tomatoes on in per the menu... it had 2 sad could of been a tomato at one point tomatoes on one side of the sandwich.   What I find to be interesting is... if you order a lunch sandwich you get a cookie. If you order a breakfast sandwich, you don't.... what the h man? Just because it is 9 am doesn't mean I am not jonesin' for a cookie!     The saving grace of this visit.... a random offensive, yet hilarious giant cookie on display which provided tons of laughs."}
{"text":"This one is for \"Tammy\" and the catering team!  Perfection ladies!!  TU!  Today I hosted a \"breakfast meeting\" for 20 people in PV.  Except, I forgot to order breakfast!  (It happens!)  I always use AJ's. Every time I called AJ's, the ONLY person who could take orders wasn't available.  Suddenly, it's \"yesterday\" & my breakfast meeting is \"today\". Yikes! I finally get thru to AJ's.  They can't do it in day.  I call 3 more AJ's.  Nope!  So, I find the Paradise Cafe on Camelback and get Tammy.  Cherrie. Helpful.  Calmed me right down!  Everything was delivered perfectly. And, everything was tasty.  Helped me load in car.  Next time I'll call Paradise!"}
{"text":"I will refuse to come to this location again because they no longer give drink refills.  I asked the manager about it since they charge the same price as a regular Paradise Bakery.  Her answer was that the health dept said they couldn't because of cross contamination when they refill a drink for you.  Well excuse me, but don't they wash their hands???  That is the first line of defense against spreading germs.  I mean really!!!  Sit down restaurants refill your drinks all the time, and now PB tries to say that they can't.  I think that is a crock of lies!  They are implying that they do not wash their hands.  GROSS!"}
{"text":"My wife and I eat there once a week because it is near our gym.  The salads and the black bean soup are great!  They also have a loyalty card that gives you a free meal after 12 paid meals that definitely make it worth while to keep coming back and the cookies aren't bad either..."}
{"text":"First they sold us soup they didn't have.   Then they gave my sandwich away to someone else.   I walked over to Chipotle.  Mistakes happen all the time - but they should at least act like they care."}
{"text":"I love paradise bakery, but the last experience I had at Tempe Marketplace was not good. I feel like the food quality has gone down dramatically since I first started eating there. Not to mention, the customer service. I stood in front of the salad bar for about 5 minutes waiting for help before I was acknowledged... while at least three employees stood to the side chatting. Then, they were rude when I seemed impatient. Then, once I received my half sandwich, it was made with the wrong bread.  This location is my least favorite. I tend to have a hard time finding seating, and the place just seems messy.   On a more positive note, the cookies were great as usual :)"}
{"text":"I've never been that impressed with Paradise Bakery, but the food is good. Not mind blowing, but good. The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is welcoming, but the ordering system is confusing and needlessly complicated. Why can't they do it Subway style and just pass the sandwich down the counter? That seems so much easier than writing everything down on a slip of paper and figuring out where to go with your food to pay and such.  I would have given this place 3 stars, but it was their ginger and molasses cookies that made it 4 stars. I LOVE their ginger and molasses cookies, it's like crack baked in an oven.  Given the choice, I would rather go to another cafe like Panera or Boudin, but Paradise is definitely not a bad choice."}
{"text":"Great service every time. If they make a mistake, they give you another free cookie. The best chocolate chip cookies... free. Yum."}
{"text":"Paradise's prices have always gotten to me, on the high end, but the salads are tasty and seem reasonably priced at this location when I compare it to salad offerings at other nearby places (Bagel Nosh - yuck!).  However, for the price of a whole salad, why no cookie??  I am disappointed that they took wraps off the menu and they moved away from the iced teas they previously carried, especially the peach.  I don't care for the new offerings."}
{"text":"Paradise Bakery has good food for reasonable prices, and I eat here fairly often. I particularly enjoy their salads. I don't think I've ever paid more than $10 for a lunch, which is about what I'd expect at a place like this.   It does seem like their menus have decreased lately, though. They used to have this delicious steak salad, but it is now gone, and one of the employees told me their southwest chicken caesar (also one of my favorites) is on the way out, too. Apparently Panera bought out the chain about five years ago and has been making gradual changes to the menu, which as far as I am concerned are definitely for the worse. I'll keep eating here for now, but if the menu loses too many more items which I enjoy I enjoy I may stop coming."}
{"text":"1st, don't open at 6, open at 7:00 I waited to buy a fresh baked scone, 7:10, not one item available for sale,  3 people working, had a rack blocking the entrance, said the baker was late.  Seem more interested in lunch and opening until 11:00pm than in providing bakery items."}
{"text":"This is a great Paradise Bakery, not only for the location, but also the staff. Susan has done a great job managing the staff and keeping a positive atmosphere throughout the day. It also is never overly crowded like the Tempe Marketplace location which just seems to be too much at times."}
{"text":"The awesome catering manager I was talking about is still there...and still awesome!  Catering orders $50+ they will deliver for a $10 fee. Ask for a catering menu and they'll include a 10% off coupon for orders $100+.  Love the staff!  Clearly they enjoy their jobs!"}
{"text":"I really like Paradise Bakery. I usually call my order in ahead of time so I can just pick it up.  Out of about 7 Paradise Bakery's, this location is the only one that has my order ready when I get there."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Ordered half sandwich and half salad. Fast service, no waiting on tables. Taste was okay, the black bean soup was quite  bland and lacked much taste. The portions are very small for the $ you pay. The lunch wasn't filling."}
{"text":"I find ordering in this store very confusing. Maybe it's just me bc I'm used to Panera Bread on the east coast. I've been here twice now and I still don't like it. I went there last wk and I'll just go to another place that's easier to order from."}
{"text":"Very disappointed! Not allergy friendly at all. They have six kinds of muffins - 3 with and nuts 3 without - but tossed them all together in the case so if you have a nut allergy you can't have anything! Seems thoughtless to me. The staff knew nothing about cross-contamination or ingredients! We did not eat anything and just left."}
{"text":"I have only good things to say about this place.  The service was great, the salads were full of flavor and made to order!  My son eats here frequently and has nothing but rave reviews for the sandwiches and soup as well.   There are many choices of cookies and muffins and they all looked very appetizing.   I left a very happy consumer and will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Love this bakery. Little pricey but good food & the tea's are amazing"}
{"text":"This location has heart! The staff is friendly and helpful, they're seemingly never understaffed. The lines go quickly. The soups are delicious and now there's squash soup, sweet and yummy!!! But the tomato is always on the menu and great! It's well maintained and good for small groups or solo. Parking right in front is always taken but it's s big lot so you'll always find a space. This is the nicest of the locations in the Valley in my opinion. I wish all of them had more GF options though."}
{"text":"One of the worst dining experiences of my life. Below are word for word notes that I put into my iPhone during this meal.  8 PM on Tuesday:  -Half bolognese pasta with cold meat sauce. I asked to get a new one and they warmed up in microwave. Received dirty looks.   -Full turkey artichoke sandwich, burning hot and turkey tastes like soggy chicken, gross. Good bread.  Elderly people in line confused where to order, when they asked chef behind counter he said he was warming food up and will not take an order.   After meal went to purchase two bagels to go, the employee gave us a full dozen for the price of two bagels. They were all stale.   Note to self: Do not return."}
{"text":"Good place for lunch, but gets a little busy. Tried several different things here, and all have been quite yummy. Decent prices & service was a-aight.  Overall- doesn't suck at all."}
{"text":"They charged me for cheese and it wasn't the sandwich. The staff is so busy chatting with each other I grabbed my own sandwich because it sat on the counter for 10 minutes. I asked for mustard, and all they had were packets, which I also didn't get. What kind of sandwich place doesn't have mustard?! Sad. I rarely buy food at the airport. This reaffirms that decision."}
{"text":"I went when this place just opened up, so they may have been under-staffed and/or under-trained. But I was literally the only person in line and it took nearly ten minutes to get my salad and soup. It kept me from going back, if I was in a hurry, but food-wise, it's a good chain in general. Vegetarian friendly options galore."}
{"text":"I must add yet another negative review here. On 7-15-15 I visited this location as I have many times in the past. Service and quality have been declining here for some time.  The chicken flatbread sandwich was disgustingly skimpy. The flatbread was stale and there was hardly anything of substance to eat. SHAMEFUL."}
{"text":"I'm usually not big on food chains but this place made our day. The staff are awesome and the food is fresh."}
{"text":"The only thing I hate about Paradise is that they don't release their nutritional information. All the better, as I probably wouldn't eat their broccoli cheddar soup if I knew what was really in it. Delicious soups and salads. I always order a custom salad with no meat and the total, for that and a bowl of soup, comes to $7.50. Great deal! Free wi-fi."}
{"text":"2 young ladies behind the counter could not have cared less to be serving customers. 5 of us in line received the same unenthusiastic, practically scowling and somewhat confusing service. Mac and cheese heavily promoted, out of Mac and cheese. Out of soup. Out of raspberry smoothie mix. Out of blue cheese for my salad ... Asked for feta instead, ultimately received no cheese. Nor a fork. Nor a napkin.   Prices are reasonable, that's about all I can say. I'm sure the other 4 customers are also wishing they'd gone to Starbucks. Or S'barro. Or just grabbed a $6 mini bag of Chex Mix and a $4 water at the sundries shop. Not your best location, Paradise.  PS: if I ask for no tomato or onion on my sandwich, pretty sure I don't want them on my side salad either.  PPS: oh look! No cranberry on my cranberry turkey sandwich! The hits keep coming ..."}
{"text":"Paradise Bakery is pretty good. I like that they have lots of nice options. I sometimes have a hard time figuring out what to order, because there are so many tasty things to choose from.  I think they could be a little more organized though. Sometimes the wait can take a really long time. And one time we went and they had run out of Mango Smoothie mix, which is usually the reason that we go there, because it is close to being my fiance's favorite thing in the world! My favorite thing is their cookies. They have so many good ones to choose from.  Paradise Bakery makes for a good meal overall!"}
{"text":"Normally I think this place was ok. However, we got sick from the butternut squash pasta we shared. And, they got my order wrong. First they yelled to me from behind the counter asking if it was to go, when I saw them write it on the paper. Then, put steak that was supposed to go on my honey's steak sandwich, and put it on my Italian sandwich. It didn't taste bad, but they ended up giving him some turkey sandwich that he said tasted disgusting. Also, we had a buy one get one free coupon for the \"you pick 2\" things, which we got 2 of them, but then they said we couldn't use the coupon. Irritating, but whatever. (And no the coupon wasn't expired) Since the food was to go, I didn't know the sandwiches were wrong until we got home. I'm not going to hold up a line and unwrap my sandwiches to look at them. I'm pretty sure they were counting on that. Would I ever return? Probably not to that location. I'll probably go to the 67th ave & 101 location. That place has never gotten me sick or screwed up my order."}
{"text":"Terrible service!  I to ordered to go and drove all the way home to find they did not give me two of my sandwiches.  Drove back after talking to the manager who said she would refund my order but when I got back she was no where to be found.  To top if off, the sandwiches were cold when I got home."}
{"text":"Pretty decent. Friendliest staff ever. Happily provided me avocado for my breakfast as which free of charge.  #thankyou!  I had a veggie Mediterranean on power whole wheat. Egg while, roasted tomato. I ordered the pesto on the side but it still a little greasy and the bread a tad soggy but I swapped the bread out (it came with ciabatta) so maybe that's the reason.  Great deal too -- under 5!  And free sample of warm molasses cookies. Loving breakfast desert!"}
{"text":"This location is nice, conveniently located, and clean. It seems to take a long time to get food, they are always out of bread bowls and baguettes at dinner time. My husband ordered the soba noodles & the cashier asked if he wanted to add a flatbread sandwich. He said ok, she stated the three different options & he chose the turkey. We are sitting & waiting for our food & cashier comes out and tells us they don't have the turkey. The soba noodle bowl was just ok, the bbq chicken flat bread looked gross, but he ate it. My broccoli cheddar soup was warm, the Fuji apple salad was delish! Since it has become Panera it just doesn't seem as good."}
{"text":"Alright, Paradise Bakery has got me. And you know what, all it took was a cookie with my lunch. Something about a great turkey sandwich (California Turkey on wheat) partnered with a warm cookie brings me back to mom's packed lunches. It can be a little loud in the dining area, but sit outside or in the back section of the restaurant and problem solved. Recently I tried one of their signature salads (a BBQ Chicken Salad), to my surprise it was fantastic. Although I will always opt for the mom-lunch half sandwich and cookie, the salad is a nice alternative on a hot summer day.  It's a nice place to go for a relatively cheap price."}
{"text":"Probably the worst Paradise I have been to. I frequent one in Omaha, NE every time I am home and it is amazing. This location doesn't even come close.  My salad was hardly tossed and dressing was in a clump in a few places (the Omaha location I go to uses a separate bowl to mix and then puts it in the bowl they serve you).  When I told the kid what I wanted he wasn't even looking at me so I wasn't sure if he got my full order. After he gave me the most pitiful looking salad I have ever received from a restaurant he walked away and I stood  waiting for my soup.  Another lady asked me if I was waiting for another salad and then she gave me my soup.  Taste was mediocre of the entire meal.  The place looks a little run down.  I chose Paradise in hopes of getting some work done but apparently I sat where all the employees take their break and an employee talked on the phone loudly her entire break.  Don't care to visit this location again."}
{"text":"Okay been here a couple more times and think I need to update. Of all the places to go this is now maybe my fourth choice. If you are meeting someone, go early to get parking otherwise you'll be later than you expect. The menu has changed and it doesn't rank as high as before - just okay, breakfast is poor and lunch depends on the day. The staff on the floor are hard working and keep it clean, the staff behind the counter is mixed. Some are cordial and others act as if waiting on you is a bother. It might be a networking place to be seen, and it seems to host cliques as if holding court...but it has lost the luster for me."}
{"text":"Every time I've come here its chaotic. Twice they have screwed up my order. I ordered a Lemon Cookie and they didn't give it to me right at the counter. I thought that was odd. When they called my order they didn't include it. I told the lady I ordered a lemon cookie and she said we don't have lemon cookies, but they did. I pointed it out to her and she gave it to me. All and all no apology and a dirty look was all I got. A simple apology was all that was needed."}
{"text":"Quick stop at the mall, and figured this was the healthiest choice for lunch. Love my chicken walnut sandwich on molasses bread and my free chocolate chip cookie :)  Usually I get a pick two ( combo half sandwich with a soup or salad) but was feeling like a whole sandwich today. Mall location is okay, the restaurant locations are much better.  Nice staff and quick service, not a bad place ."}
{"text":"Similar to a Panera, but I got a chocolate chip cookie and a 1/2 Turkey BLT to go (turkey, bacon, avocado). Prices might've increased a little since then, but mine came out to $6.49 with tax (pretty reasonable for airport food if you ask me). Quick, convenient, and a great flavor blending overall. Left me to enjoy the rest of my layover with a view and a seat near the window"}
{"text":"I used to like Paradise Bakery a lot more than I do now. They've changed their menu a bunch, and while I appreciate a menu that isn't stagnant, I found myself just staring at their chalk boards unable to find something that sounded appealing.   I ended up selecting their avocado Cobb salad and it came with like three chunks of avocado. My full size salad and a medium sized mediocre iced coffee drink ran me almost $15 after tax.  Not impressed."}
{"text":"The coffee there was just ok, but pastries were good there. a great place if you were on the go, and want something light."}
{"text":"I know I should not have high expectations for an airport location.  However, there were complaints of people who had received their food and their order was incorrect or missing ingredients.  I had to remind the staff to make sure they topped my salad with the dried fuji apples.  I was the only person, out of roughly six or so people that actually receive the correct food.  I guess it is tough to get decent help.  Probably should be **1/2."}
{"text":"Rudest staff ever! If you don't understand customer service, you should not be in the service business. There were 4 people working at 6:30am, but only two really dining any work. 3 gals and and guy, the guys was the rudest."}
{"text":"I went into this store tonight for some dinner. I checked online before going to make sure they weren't closing soon. I was there 35 minutes before closing so I figured I'd get a quick salad and soup combo to go and both of the girls who helped me CLEARLY annoyed I dared to come in 35 minutes before closing. Normally I'd let something like this go because I'm not one to tattle. But I got really angry when a family of four walked in a couple minutes after me and the girl gave a audible sigh that was clearly one of annoyance before giving them any form of acknowledgement. I couldn't believe the way this girl was speaking to the mother who was trying to order for her boys and her husband. She was so unbelievably disrespectful. If you hate serving people, don't work in an F&B environment! I had a bad experience at this location about a year ago and hadn't gone back till tonight. After this I would rather throw my money away than give it to this establishment."}
{"text":"I don't know why this location keeps getting such stingy ratings. Let's be honest: Panera is a chain and more or less can be considered fast food since this location even has a drive-thru for gods sake. In my opinion, the food here is higher quality than what you would get at McDonald's, which is also a fast food chain where you can get stuff for cheap prices. Therefore, the prices here can be expected since the quality is higher and, hey, its in a city. Everything in cities that isn't considered subpar potentially toxic junk is going to have a fair price on it. Secondly, why do people expect the finest chefs of the area to be working here?? No, those chefs are going to be at nice sit-down restaurants that are most likely local non-chains. Therefore, you /will/ get average food here. Honestly, any fast food shouldn't be expected to be exquisite. Its called fast-food for a reason. Every time I go here (probably once every other week) the workers are nice and the food is nice quality. Its not kiss-your-fingers delicious but because I don't expect that whatsoever, but its still pretty great compared to other fast-food options. Plus, there's healthier options here compared to other places. I understand low ratings if you've found your food super pathetically made (as in a sandwich that's soggy or cold soup that should be hot, a bug in the food, etc.), but giving a fast food chain one or two stars for not having exquisite quality food and reporting that this location is closed b/c of it is pretty laughably pathetic."}
{"text":"Went here earlier this evening to get dinner for my husband and I. There was a little confusion with a new girl knowing which breads went for which sandwiches, (which they were out of all but wheat or sourdough..I wouldn't have gone if I had known that). But I can completely understand that happening with being new & not fully knowing the menu. (I've been in that spot many times.) Towards the end I ordered a soup and roll with our order, and the manager told me to pay with the cashier and she'd give it to us in a minute (she was getting it ready). Nope. I had so much other on my order to check on I hadn't noticed. Later, I get home only to notice I am missing the soup snd roll. They supplied me with the extra tortilla chips but not the actual dish. I drove all the way back and thankfully they remembered me and gave it to me free and blamed it on miscommunication, no problems at all. They (almost) fully redeemed themselves on that part! But on a huge note, the two times I was there this evening, the young, longer haired brunette girl on salad bar had the attitude of \"you're annoying/pain in the ass/I have better things to do\". My husband wanted me to get more salad for him while there, and I didn't, just to avoid her really crappy attitude after the crappy day I've had. Sorry us costumers that came here for a nice meal had to be such a burden to you're difficult day. We didn't mean to be such a pain in your ass while you're getting paid! I've had enough happen for this week with putting our dog down and other personal stuff, the last thing we needed was this girls guilt trip attitude..This girl kept it from being 5 stars though. The food and service are otherwise amazing!!"}
{"text":"The cashier who took my order was nice and friendly but I ordered the pick 2 and on the receipt it says it comes with a cookie. But they told me and my cousin who ordered the same thing that it doesn't come with it. Even though it says it on our receipts. Okay. Overpriced food and not the best customer service."}
{"text":"been going here for years.  food always good.  unfortunately, this time the broccoli/cheese soup was way too watery.  never had b4 so i'm not sure if it's supposed to be this way.  the other complaint is, NO COOKIE!  can't understand that one at all.  we both had sandwich/soup combo and was given a choice of apple/bagette/chips.  really?  baguette with soup?  the server said eve since panera took them over.  i tell you, that's one thing we always remembered about paradise bakery...\"let's go there, cookie with your meal'.  it was a treat.  well no more...really bad, bad marketing.  sometimes little things like that stick in customers minds.  an example, in NYC at the doubletree they have a free can of cookies.  whenever we were in NY, we'd stayed there just because if the prices were comparable.    in any case, no pleased whatsoever and it appears the take over hasn't done any favors for paradise bakery."}
{"text":"Great menu and ambiance, but poor execution.  Ordered Breakfast Power Sandwich on whole wheat bagel, got it on regular bread heavily grilled with butter. Not a healthy choice, and they screwed up the order. Cashier was super grumpy, and I let her know, she didn't care."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Fantastic COFFEE drink! Way better than anything I've had at starbucks, ever! I use to love Seattle's Best in Borders and the Gloria Jeans in a few malls throughout the country and this held up and exceeded their fantastic coffees and frap type drinks. Their pastries were soft and fresh and also so yummy. It was busy both times we were there but well worth the wait. It moves rather quickly considering how many people are there, the amount that they put out, the complexity of some items ordered. The staff works well under busy, retail pressure."}
{"text":"Monday the 19th at 820pm. I ordered a strawberry smoothie and there was 1 person ahead of me. The cashier asked Kim to make the smoothie and she replied \"can't you see I'm busy?\", And stood behind the counter as 3 other customers walked up and waited behind me. The employees continued to hoarse around while more customers approached and then Kim got on the second register as 2 customers left. The male and female correcting a sandwich order we're the only 2 working in the 10 minutes it took to finish the smoothie."}
{"text":"Total Rip-off!  I ordered a flatbread Med Chicken sandwich with 3 small, mealy pieces of chicken and so little humus that you couldn't even scrape any of it off. It was 4x flatbread with very little filling. People who worked there were nice though - must be mgmt greed. Eat at PF Chang's or Buca di Beppo if you want better and more food at a reasonable cost!"}
{"text":"I was here on 6/9/11. A person named kat waited on us. She was beyond rude. When I handed her my rewards card, I told her it was also a gift card. She was so busy yapping to everyone, she wasn't paying attention to what I said. After she ran it through as a gift card, she told me the balance, at which time I repeated that it was also a gift card. At that point she looked up at me and said, very rudely,you need to tell us that when you walk up. I had also paid for toast. She never gave me a number, so I never got any toast. The other person, with me, ordered a meal, was given the wrong number, so the person kept walking around, with his breakfast, looking for a non-existent number. We finally got his breakfast after chasing the person down. When I asked for a refund, another server insisted that I get my toast and made me stand and wait while they made it. Now, I have a rewards card with over 300 visits on it. This was the biggest mess, and the worst customer service I have ever experienced. BEWARE when choosing a paradise bakery."}
{"text":"It's early in the morning at the PHX airport, and there aren't very many food options. What should one do? Go to the golden arches, then hate yourself afterwards? Nah. Don't do that. Go to Paradise in the C concourse of Terminal 4. Especially convenient if you are flying Southwest Airlines to Denver. It's open really early and you'll actually enjoy (somewhat) what you are eating.  I can speak for breakfast and lunch here. Breakfast is more of a two-star experience given that the bagel, sausage, egg and cheese sandwich I had could have more flavor if it was dipped in jet fuel (which it might have been). The lunch/dinner options are much better, ranging from 3 to 4 stars, for an airport mind you. Try anything with a croissant. It will rock your socks off."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a couple of months now and it quickly became my go-to lunch spot. The food is good and the coffee is good. Usually my meal is ready in under 10 minutes. However, recently, and on more than a few occasions, the service is downright awful.  Specific employees do a slipshod job making food, which means the quality of the food varies depending on who's making it. Today, I came in before the lunchtime rush because I needed to be back at the office quickly. Long story short, they forgot about my order. I watched people who ordered long after me get their food first. If not for the manager telling an employee to actually start making my food (and subsequently motioning towards me to show that I was still waiting), I would have waited even longer than 20 minutes. This would have been wholly forgivable with a quick apology, I get it, mistakes happen and customers need to be realistic. But no apology is inexcusable.  The cashiers are always pleasant and friendly."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of paradise bakery, but I'll eat there on occasion. This location lacks any type of customer service. We walked in and weren't greeted. The girl rolled her eyes twice at my husband and I as we asked for our soups and asked for the tortilla strips to go on top. They did not make us feel welcomed at all and like we were a burden. Also we were the only ones in line so it's not like it was busy. We won't be back."}
{"text":"OK, so Paradise Bakery is a chain restaurant. But, I had lunch there today, so you're going to hear about it. I've had Paradise on several occasions, but this was my first visit to their new Raintree location.   Let's cut to the chase. They have the BEST cookies ever! Chewy and 3/4 baked, just the way I like them. And the fact that they include a cookie with you sandwich pretty much eliminates the guilt. There's almost NO chance I'd order a cookie with my lunch. But, throw it in? I'm eating that thing.   Before we lose focus, the sandwiches are great. The Tuscan Chicken is phenomenal, but you pretty much can't go wrong with anything you choose. Don't forget the pasta salad. And, did I mention the cookie?"}
{"text":"The menu reminds me of Panera Bread and as it turns out, they're the same company.  They're salads are delicious and are made to order. You can switch out veggies too, and change up the dressing as well.  The cookies weren't to-die-for but were still edible. I do have a problem with their bagels. They're never as soft as I feel fresh bagels should be.   It's fairly busy during the lunch rush but the line moves fast."}
{"text":"I've only been to Paradise Bakery once, maybe twice? I remember them having some yummy menu items. So, when my son suggested we meet there for lunch, I said yes.  We went on a week day around noon. It was busy, but not crazy busy. We had a short wait in line. I ordered the Greek Chicken Salad. He ordered the Soba Noodle Bowl. I was given the salad and the soup was brought in a fair amount of time to our table.   I had noticed after we were seated that the salad didn't have any chicken on it. I asked the server about it when she brought the soup. She asked if I had ordered chicken. I was a bit puzzled since the menu showed it as a Greek Salad with Chicken. She told me it doesn't automatically come with it. She did offer to get some for me at no charge. It was odd since I wasn't asked when I ordered it, but maybe I'm just a Paradise Bakery newbie. I'll know next time. The broth bowl looked delicious! I tried some and may very well come back another time for one myself.  Overall, it was a good experience. Service was good. Food very good. Lots of menu options."}
{"text":"This is a decent lunch spot - good sandwiches and good selection of other items.  However, it is also a great place to hang out with friends.  The staff will let you stay all day - play cards, work on the computer, you name it.  On afternoons there is a whole room of people just playing games.  They have free wifi, ample space and great warm baked treats"}
{"text":"This a good spot for lunch at the airport. Pretty standard cafe fare, but they are known for their chocolate chip cookies and this location does them just as good as the others.  My in-laws live in Scottsdale so we fly home out of Sky Harbor often and we always make sure to stop here for cookies to bring home."}
{"text":"Morning staff was very friendly; They made me the poppy-citrus chicken salad for me to-go and it was bursting with berries and with pecans and lots of chicken - way to go!  It was really filling (tho not cheap!) and I'm glad I stopped by... PLUS, I get to earn my points on my frequent-eater card :P  I recommend this place in Term 2 for food."}
{"text":"I use to love this place...would do anything to go there; but since they changed their menu...I just don't like it as much.  Their portions are tiny and their price increased...how does that happen?!?!  Anyway, I am sure you can find a number of other places with better food close to any Paradise Bakery..."}
{"text":"This is now been transferred into a Panera. Went here 2 days in a row and both times the ice tea was watered down, 90% of bagels gone by 0930, and they won't take your paradise rewards card. I could be mistaken, but I thought the two were the exact same company. Saying that, panera sucks! Wish they changed them all over to Paradise's"}
{"text":"We like this place.  We kind of stumbled upon it and had the usual expectations that it'd just be \"airport food\".  Well the quality of the food turned out to be very satisfying and the staff friendly and helpful.    Some of the entrees come with extra things, like a free cookie, which we weren't expecting.  That's definitely a nice touch and extra gesture that I just don't expect at an airport.    And for this, they deserve 5 stars from me, something I only give out very selectively."}
{"text":"A cafe is a cafe is a cafe....right? Well, yeah. Of course.  On Friday, I had to run a quick errand in the area, and popped in for lunch. Service was pretty fast. Picked up a delicious ham and swiss sandwich on multigrain bread.   Everything came out as ordered, and relatively quick. Very tasty. The meat wasn't slimy, the cheese was perfect, and the veggies were crisp and delicious. Just a hint of mustard. It was the kind of sandwich that made my afternoon.   Also, I got a free chocolate chip cookie. Everyone gets one. Usually I get free stuff because I am quite the charmer, but you can feel special here. The staff is very nice. Friendly.  The Iced Tea selection is pretty cool too!  My lunch was a touch on the pricey side. About nine bucks. Oh well. Who cares. At least it was worth it.  I'm coming back to try some of the other sandwiches too. If you want to see what mine looked like, check out the picture I uploaded.  Over and out."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting! I wish I could post a photo of the sandwich I just paid $10 for."}
{"text":"This location is not closed and they are amazing! I've picked up a catering order twice from them this week. The first time 14 sandwiches with no warning and they made them in 20 minutes. The second time 9 sandwiches and they made them in 15 minutes and because they were a little late gave me free lemonade me two dozen cookies! I will use them for all my sandwich needs not only because they have great sandwiches but because they are also great. 10/10 would recommend!"}
{"text":"Compared to other Paradise Bakery locations, this one was above par!  Great service, great food, and I liked the layout with abundant booth seating.  A tad bit smaller than the ones I usually go to but we found ample seating.  Great experience!"}
{"text":"Double fudge brownie at the mall.  It's my go-to after getting my hair done, some shopping, etc.  It's not homemade but close enough to delicious not to matter!  It's moist, full of chocolate goodness, and topped with frosting.  Last Christmas, while enjoying this treat, I walked into a clothing display.  I no longer eat and walk.  I sit and enjoy it like it is meant to be, lol.  They have other things at Paradise Bakery but I won't cheat on my one true love here."}
{"text":"We come here pretty often when we do 'kid's day out' with my nieces and nephews.. well, we went this weekend for another event that brought us to the Tempe Marketplace and, although it was a Sunday, it was quite busy and thus it was both noisy and dirty.    They have a lot of staff, too, to keep up w/ the demands of the business, but maybe not enough cleaning staff.  Tables were dirty and so was the drink area... plus, there is *always* a line for the bathroom...  Food was decent: I had the mozz panini (which was very tasty), but both my friend's paninis (which had more ingredients than mine) were boring as dirt... my friend's Salmon Club was very good (per him).  It's Paradise food.. not too inventive, just mildlly enough to make you want to order it.  This place is OK given it's central mall location, speed of service, tastiness of food, cleanliness."}
{"text":"I'm a regular, mostly out of convenience.  The food is good and fresh and made to order which I really like.  The menu selection is pretty vast however I usually stick to the half bbq chicken salad which I can't get enough of.  The prices have gone up a little bit in the past few months but still a good deal.  Service is pretty spot on here unless you go at the lunch rush, which then is just madness."}
{"text":"I have not been here since I moved to San Diego - but man great customer service - I ordered my whole grain toast with avacado and it was delicious - as I was leaving the manager chatted with me about my shopping at Macy's and gave me pointers on the email coupons they send. Super sweet lady!! Why can't All customer service experiences be like this?"}
{"text":"My lady friend got really annoyed the other day at Paradise Bakery and was almost in tears over the stress endured trying to order a simple lettuce and tomato salad and some blue cheese dressing on top. She got something completely different and an ass chewing.  She explained perfectly what she wanted while being prodded down the chute by a young manager and a couple of fellas on the line that had not yet mastered the English language. After a completely unnecessary lecture by this manager fella who seemed annoyed that anyone would dare ask a question to slow down the ringing of the almighty cash register, they completely disregarded her request and gave her a bowl of miscellaneous pasture weeds and a sweet balsamic dressing.    She was frazzled and pissed when we sat down but not one to complain. I witnessed the entire thing and they could have easily given her a bowl of romaine, some tomato and blue cheese dressing.  This having been my first time I'd been in a Paradise Cafe for lunch the entire experience seemed a little awkward. I had to look around to find any type of menu and all I saw was sandwiches.  After I ordered I saw the salad menu but it was too dam late, I was already down the end of the line where they clip your ear and brand your backside with a sandwich built their way with no choice of bread, cheese or even the cookie.  Wildflower seems to cater much better to the soup, salad and sandwich consumer than Paradise Cafe. I like it when a restaurant has well thought out menus and they don't treat you like cattle."}
{"text":"This location rules my balls. Hooked it up with a free cookie!!!! Ahhh, I love free cookies!"}
{"text":"This is the worst. Place was totally filthy ask for a table to be wiped off used a dirty wet rag and didn't dry and walked off. Broccoli soup was over salted and sandwich was horrible  Looks like they could use a training  course in customer service as well as some adult supervision  Look like The millianians have taken this place over!!"}
{"text":"Slower than slow. 4 on food and 1 on service. Unless you have 30 Minutes to wait don't bother."}
{"text":"If I could give no stars I would...  I remember a day when Paradise Bakery was known for friendly, quick service and delicious food. The portions have shrunk, but prices have gone up. The menu has changed so much I don't recognize it. I miss good, simple food (i.e. Fontina grilled cheese).   Set that aside, the service was so slow here. It took me 40 minutes to order my food, pay, then receive said food. There was no joy in this place. Paradise has gone downhill fast and I believe Panera is to blame. This location has sealed the deal for me... I am not returning to a Paradise Bakery or Panera ever.   When I opened my meal (I took it to go), there was a measly portion for $8.19. Additionally, the chicken used appears to be the pieces I usually cut off and throw away before cooking. Traditionally, an entree comes with a cookie (it's Paradise bakery, people love their cookies), however, no cookie was there."}
{"text":"This is a good place for a quick, healthy lunch. The sandwiches and salads are tasty and the coffee and desserts are good as well. Just keep in mind, it gets pretty crowded at lunch so parking may be crowded and there's almost always a line, but they do a good job of getting to you quickly. While its not a place for a long, quiet conversation, it does its job."}
{"text":"Let's get the record straight... I LOVE Paradise Bakery. This location however I had an awful experience...  I got a half  salad, half paradise club combo. my fav!  Well the salad was decent as always, but when I got to the sandwich I took a bite and immediately spit it out! The sauce on the sandwich had a REALLY funky metallic taste and it tasted sour!  I was kind of wondering how they gave me my sandwich SO fast. It was probably sitting there for 5 hours.  I got a manager and got a refund. Utterly disgusted at what I experienced.  I told the manager to check the dates on the sauces before someone else gets a nasty surprise. He gave me my money back, but wasn't sorry or anything.   Won't be stopping in the location ever again!!"}
{"text":"4.5 STARS  This is one of my favorite lunch places.  I have never seen the Arrowhead Paradise Bakery when it's NOT a complete madhouse.  Perhaps it's because there really aren't that many good places to get a sandwich in this neck of the woods.  Who knows.  The service line for this counter-style joint went out the door last week when I was there - but it's still worth the wait, I think.  And somehow, the staff does their job well, and keep churning out happy customers.  I'm not a fan of soup, at all.  It's just not my thang.  BUT, their legendary Fire Roasted Tomato soup does weird things to me.  It is heavenly.  I crave it!  I look forward to it the day before, get cranky if they don't have it for whatever reason, etc, etc.  I usually order it with the turkey chipotle wrap - with it's chipotle raspberry cheese smear - is a tangy mix of spicy and sweet.  And the cookies, while they seem like an afterthought of the tasty lunch, are just as good as you would think.   This is one of the few locations that is free-standing and NOT in a mall, so expect more room, nicer furniture, chairs, tables.  Expect an uppity Arrowhead soccer mom / business casual crowd, and expect to wait  15 minutes to order."}
{"text":"For airport food, this is top notch!  I had a California Turkey sandwich, and not only was it massive, tasty, and justifiably healthy with all its freshness, but they gave me a chocolate chip coookie, too!!  Much, much better and more reasonable (~$8) than any other option."}
{"text":"I sure do love me some Paradise! Pretty clean store. Decent customer service. Not a whole lot to say about this location besides I've had issues with the free internet when I've been there. See you soon chocolate chip cookie with coconut"}
{"text":"I think this place sucks. Their ordering system seems to be designed to cause maximum annoyance for the customer. It definitely does that. They are part of a chain, and in my opinion, their goal is mediocre, generic food for the masses. I feel they have accomplished this goal.  I asked once if I could order off the breakfast menu later in the day & they said I could. Then I got to the cash register & was charged $2 more than the posted price. The person informed me that the price was only good during breakfast. Uh, when I asked about ordering the item, that might have been a good time to let me know I was not going to be charged the posted price.  I only end up here when it's chosen by someone else. Last Sunday I was meeting with some co-workers to get some work done. We were working on computers & using the internet like most people in the world do today, but their internet would log us off every 30 minutes. Such a corporate way to set up your internet. Sad that some places do not realize that the longer I am in your place working, the more food & drinks I buy, even if they are mediocre.  Basically this place is just another lame chain that I hope to avoid in the future. We have so many great local businesses that there's just no reason to support a place like this."}
{"text":"I love their items I stop by a couple of times when visiting Phoenix. Very fast service and good quality food. I just don't like when you get ring up some cashiers don't ask you for your reward card. I hate having to remind them, it comes off as it's a hassle to them. My favorite is the fire roasted tomato soup, I wish panera bread offered it. Good location parking is kinda annoying because you have to park far bit it's worth it."}
{"text":"Just your typical over-priced, weak service sandwich/salad chain. A lot of people behind the counter talking amongst themselves and starting at you blankly when they finally decide to help you.   My friend and I met here for a quick bite. She got a large salad and the mac and cheese kids meal. Paid over $18. The kids meal didn't even come with a drink, she had to get that separately.  Not a great experience. Next time I'll go to smashburger or the teriyaki place on the end."}
{"text":"Can't really go wrong with Paradise Bakery. They're  sandwiches are always fresh and with a cookie with every sandwich how can you go wrong. My fav is the chicken walnut sandwich. But the Ham and swiss is pretty good too. Great flavors at Paradise and never much of a wait. They have it down to a science. I gave them 4 cookies and no none of them were tossed... lol"}
{"text":"The food is decent. Not a lot of bang for you buck here though.  The service is very slow and it seems the store is poorly managed as tables were dirty, silverware dirty.  Some of the employee seem like your bothering them at work.  There is no sense of urgency in servicing customers.  To top it all off they were out of chocolates chip cookies."}
{"text":"I went to PB at Tempe Marketplace for a business lunch today.  All three of us ordered sandwiches, and neither of us were very impressed with our meals.  Two of us ordered sandwiches which were said to be made with a \"zesty horseradish sauce,\" which he and I both commented was gross and unlike any horseradish we had ever had.  I normally love horseradish, especially on my roast beef sandwiches, so I actually asked the PB employee to make mine with extra horseradish.  This sauce was more like thick mayonnaise, and I think it ruins the sandwich.  Also, the place was packed.  It seemed understaffed for how busy they were.  Oh, but the chocolate chip cookies are always good."}
{"text":"I eat like a pig when I am on the road- nothing but comfort food. So prior to getting on a cramped plane for a six hour flight, I decided to play it safe and eat a salad. I ordered the Asian sesame chicken salad. Absolutely disgusting! Thankful I have a keen sense of smell and taste- the second that furry piece of chicken hit my tongue it was immediately spit back into box from whence it came! Then I decided to take a whiff- rancid! Because this place is located before security and I was already through security when I decided to eat- I did not have time to take it back! Tried to do the healthy thing now I have to worry about salmonella- hope I get an aisle seat by the bathroom! DISGUSTING!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend introduced me to Paradise Bakery and now I am a fan! I came here a few days ago for lunch with my friend. I wanted a BLT but they didn't have it on the menu so they made one for me. I got it on a croissant, which was flaky and buttery! And I got a bowl of their steak chili that was fantastic! All of their meals come with a cookie to complete everything. Welcome to Paradise!"}
{"text":"Kyle is The best manager I have ever dealt with. He went above and beyond to make sure I was a satisfied customer. I had just received poor customer service from a manager Mark at another location and Kyle did what he could to make up for the poor service.  He not only treated me wonderful but he also did the same for some other people near me. It shows what a good manager and person he is."}
{"text":"So....it does not have the full menu options like that of a regular paradise bakery. IT is still great and has the basics, the problem is, depending on the season (IE- the blue hairs or younger types who are there due to weather or school schedules) can make the wait quite long.  Seating is open food court in the mall, which is loud and again, depending on time of year, difficult to find. Regardless, I stop here if I am in this mall!"}
{"text":"Had a little snack at this cafe awaiting flight. Got the shrimp couscous salad while husband ordered the turkey club on croissant. Salad was ordinary. Fresh for airport food. If you're not too hungry, you can order half of the salad. I probably won't ever order the shrimp salad again. We also got a couple of chocolate chip cookies. The dough was sweet and only became richer with the chocolate chips. They were flat and slightly crunchy. They supposedly were baked two hours ago. I prefer my cookies fat and full.   The waitstaff attending to our order was very pleasant. Our banana nut muffins remain uneaten but looks promising."}
{"text":"Great location for a quick bite!   Good soups and sandwiches.  Nice desserts.  I only give four out of five stars because it is a tad pricey for the food you recieve."}
{"text":"The coffee is amazing, a bit watered down compared to Starbucks coffee but definitely smoother.   My only complaint was my muffin. I LOVE muffins, especially poppyseed muffins. You can hardly ever go wrong. Yesterday morning however it was awful. Too dry, lacking in flavor, and too heavy, missed that muffin quality. Made me question if I'd ever enjoy muffins again. This is a bakery after all, it's speciality should be the originals. Please step it up PB, I need muffins in my life."}
{"text":"I love this place , the food is always fresh and Yummy, in my opinion, the only place worth eating at while your at the airport at terminal 3 waitin' for a plane."}
{"text":"I had the worst panini I've ever had. It was the smokehouse turkey and it wasn't even edible. It tasted processed and looked like they marked the sandwich with grill lines.. I always want to like paradise bakery but it just comes up short every time, think I'm done."}
{"text":"While in town for a wedding, stopped by this place to pick up breakfast items for the group.   Staff was very friendly and the pastries were good.   Got there around 9:30am on a Saturday so choices were a little limited (as I needed about 20 items) but all that we choose were tasty."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. The girl taking my order was so quite I couldn't even hear what she was was saying. None of the workers care about you and they seem like they wanna kill themselves. I ordered the scrambled breakfast...... This is where everything turns bad. The eggs were brown... Last time I check scrambled eggs are yellow not brown... I tasted it and it had no taste at all not even some salt something we're wrong with these eggs. It comes to bacon two small strips thank god those were okay. Also two pieces of toast so small.. This breakfast is for kids not for men that are hungry. Very sad to see paradise bakery going down and Panera buying out every location.. This is just bad please do not order breakfast here I have no idea how lunch is but breakfast is terrible what a waste for 7$ I'd rather go spend 7$ at McDonald's and get breakfast there and I would actually enjoy every bite of it!! Get new staff and a new chef!! This place is terrible!!!!"}
{"text":"This place was above and beyond for an eatery inside an airport. The sandwiches were fresh and bountiful portions. I had the chicken salad sandwich and it was really moist. You get a free cookie with every sandwich or salad. The bakery items looked amazing and the cookies were delicious. We ended up getting about 5 free cookies from the staff. There was also a ton of variety, not just choc chip or oatmeal, but also double choc, nutty cookies and a delicious ginger molasses."}
{"text":"Coming from the east coast we had Paneras everywhere.  The food was always consistently good but not spectacular.  Knowing Paradise bakery was basically Panera I was good coming for lunch.  Unfortunately the ordering experience is horrible.   Having to go to different stations for different parts of the meal and knowing what to order where is a horribly inefficient way to order and causes issues.  And we had issues.  Just placing the order was a trial in patients.   Then they brought us there rounds of food because they couldn't figure out what we ordered or what we got.  I feel sorry for the workers because they are forced to use an inefficient system that causes customer frustration.  With these places switching to Paneras, I'm sure the workers will be happier and the customers will be more satisfied.  A case in point is i took my boss to a Panera and he had only been to Paradise bakeries.   He was impressed with how fast we placed our order and got our food, which is really the same you can get here.  We will not be back until this location makes the switch."}
{"text":"Seriously?  Who likes this chain bs quality crap?  I like myself a badass sandwich.  This place DOES NOT have it.  Inadequate portions, inadequate food, un-personable service and tacky typical \"bread/bakery co\" atmosphere.  I've now been over 5 times since i moved here 4 months ago, and not one visit has been satisfactory or fulfilling.  I'm going to wildflower with better portions and flavor or taking a trip to pane bianco.    Dont waste your taste buds."}
{"text":"I'm sorry but to start I haven't been here in years and was excited to eat here. One I asked for a large Cesar salad with extra dressing. Didn't get any just enough for a little bit. Luckily I am at work eating my food so I could grab dressing for me. And second there is a bone in my chicken salad like really at first I thought it was part of my fork but no it's not. So I also ordered a sandwich wrapped horribly fell apart when I tried to take it out. I also ordered no onions on my sandwich came with onions luckily I'm not allergic to them. I'm very disappointed I ended up throwing my food away"}
{"text":"I like this place bec it serves great salad. My fav is the Mediterranean chicken quinoa bec it's very tasty and it's always fresh. My problem with this place is consistency! I get this salad all the time and every time I get it, there's always something different. One time I got it with regular tomatoes, another time with the sundried tomatoes, once without feta cheese, other times with feta. I think I have only gotten this salad the way it should be one time. Perhaps there's training problem which management should really look into."}
{"text":"Went here for something sweet after the bar.  The young lady behind the counter recommended the cream cheese brownie.  My goodness this was beyond amazing.  Incredibly sweet but not too sweet.  Tasted very fresh.  Considering I was coming later in the day this is never a certainty.  Plus the brownie got it;s on little box, which was just a nice touch."}
{"text":"Serious attitude from the sandwich maker when I asked what sandwich it was on my plate. I had ordered a turkey cranberry and the made me a plain turkey on white bread. I told him I had ordered the turkey cranberry. He insisted they only rang me up for a plain. I said that was fine, but I'd like the right sandwich. He dismissed the white sandwich and said he couldn't take it, then added 'what do you want paper for that one too?!' Then rolled his eyes and turned to grab a sheet of paper... sorry your life sucks bro, just wanted the right sandwich."}
{"text":"Finally exposed this \"fresh\" restaurant after asking a few probing questions. Another example of a great reason to avoid chains. Curious about what brand of turkey that was in use here, the nice guy behind the counter went to check and could not figure it out.  After that, it was soon discovered that Paradise has one main distribution center in Phoenix and all restaurants get their food delivered to them which means nothing is even made in the individual stores. The \"turkey\" comes pre-sliced (think Subway) and the soup is sent over in bags. Not sure what a paradise brand turkey is, but it looked like the lowest form of meat - slimy and it has those edges of brown (the ones you peel off like cheese rind) which can always be found in inferior packaged meats. They also use only two slices of turkey to make their $8 sandwich. The motto of \"fresh\" needs to be re-examined as well as the heads of all the clueless Phoenix people who love this crappy chain.  Clearly glad that a few questions saved me from a lousy sandwich experience."}
{"text":"Ordered a chicken Caesar salad I ended up with barely any salad and a ton of broken croutons crumbs and a load of parm.... way to many toppings... wasnt great. Staff seemed pretty disinterested in customers more interested in closing and leaving for the day..."}
{"text":"I was shocked that a half of southwest chicken salad was $6.00. I realize at the airport you typically pay more but I found this a big rip off.  Not to mention it was not big at all. It was worth perhaps $4.00 total"}
{"text":"Lack a process to orders drink only and are under staffed.  Go to the line and be ready to wait."}
{"text":"When you walk in the door of the Biltmore location is smells like sewage.  Not exactly appetizing.  I've actually walked in and then right out without ordering because it's been so bad.    When I can stomach the smell enough to wait in the huge line I'm inevitably annoyed by the ordering process.  They have an employee assigned to each station (salad, sandwich, soup).  The problem is, if you want a salad and so do the ten people in front of you, you have to wait for the one salad maker to take your order as the sandwich person twiddles their thumbs because no one needs a sandwich.  Wouldnt it make more sense to train everyone on all three stations?  The other awkward thing about the line is that if you don't want a salad but want soup, you are supposed to cut in front of everyone waiting for a salad.  All the Q-Tip heads that are spending the winter in AZ that are in the salad line don't understand that you are NOT cutting them by going directly to the soup station.  It's not their fault though...it's Paradise Bakery's fault for having such a stupid ordering process.  It's just awkward and frustrating for everyone involved.   When you finally get to the register to pay it's usually worth it because the food is pretty good.  I like their salads and they have awesome cookies.  Food is four starts.  Process is one star.  Average of three stars."}
{"text":"Hands down the best place to eat while at Terminal 3.  Lots of selection, and tastes fresh rather than microwaved.  Chicken Salad sandwich is my favorite, along with a small Caesar.  I would agree with a previous reviewer, sometimes they put too much dressing.  But you get a free cookie (YUM) with your meal and the people here have always been pleasant and cheerful that helps put a grumpy traveler in a better mood."}
{"text":"It was cool to watch someone making pastries but was definitley on the pricey side.  I paid $10 for bacon/egg/cheese bagel and an orange juice.  Really clean with plenty of seats and good food, but I'm not sure if it's worth the price."}
{"text":"I just walked out of there and there were probably about 8 employees with 6 customers. So let's say it was dead. The three employees that I interacted with were acting as if I was interrupting their time to socialize. They were all young, probably their weekend job while in school. I've never been to a Paradise where I felt like I was ruining their day by giving them business."}
{"text":"Awesome turkey cranberry !"}
{"text":"I study a lot.  Finding places to study in Glendale isn't easy.  Paradise is the best of the \"easy\" options I've found around school.  They have plenty of plugs, halfway reliable wifi, and pretty good (unlimited) coffee.  Oh, and the free samples of cookies and bread are also nice when you're in the realm of $250,000 in debt.  That being said, nothing here is particularly worth it's cost.  The coffee is \"generic dark\" or \"flavored\".  I take my coffee pretty seriously, so this was the first major sin they committed upon my person.  The food is also WAY overpriced for the quality.  This place is supposed to be a bakery.  Why is the bread so dull tasting?  Why do the cookies taste like nothing more than preservative and artificial dyes?  Yeah, I'll keep going here for the coffee and a change of pace, but I'm not going to recommend it for anything beyond that."}
{"text":"Walked in here, and we all took a step back and thought, \"Whoa, didn't realize this was a Panera.\" A worker confirmed that Panera would be purchasing the entire Paradise Bakery & Cafe franchise and turning them into Panera locations. Smart strategy move on Panera's part; even the menu items, down to the soba noodles and you pick 2 soup and 1/2 sandwich is similar.  I got a 1/2 size turkey flatbread & bowl of mac & cheese. Like the rating says, it was just \"A-OK.\" I also got an Asiago bagel for the flight home & even the cream cheese on the side is exactly Panera-esque. Again, it was ok.   The thing that sets aside Paradise Bakery & Cafe from Panera are their crack cookies. Their chocolate chip cookies are freaking soft, gooey, and so downright delicious.   tl;dr Get their chocolate chip cookies. Otherwise, it's a Panera."}
{"text":"I've came to the realization this place somehow makes me depressed when I come here. Like a cloud comes over me and all good judgement, positive energy, patience goes, whoop, right out the window.  I had the pleasure of arguing with a girl working at 5pm 6/19, who claims they never had a roast beef sandwich and definitely not roasted peppers! I was a fool for thinking so.. I mean, it was only a staple in my routine for years, maybe I am losing my marbles?! Ok, fine... How about a BBQ chicken salad, there were less ingredients than the name itself. I found myself asking to  add so many additional items normally found in a traditional BBQ salad, it would have been easier to do it myself. Plan on extra for cheese because $9 just isn't enough to cover it. I utterly despise this place. Done & done with your food & crusty staff members!"}
{"text":"We almost always stop here when we are transiting terminal 3 at Phoenix Sky Harbor. Great food, fast and friendly service, and conveniently located at the gate/security level."}
{"text":"I love that the airport has a place with fresh, healthy, customizable food! Paradise Bakery has a salad bar (how often have you seen an airport with a salad bar?!), and though they don't have the hugest selection of toppings there are a good number of interesting options beyond just tomato/cucumber/carrots. The bakery section has a lot of tempting treats and a good standard selection of sandwiches."}
{"text":"Normally I like paradise bakery more but this location has screwed up my order more often than not"}
{"text":"The food is delicious but quite pricey. Very crowded at lunch, felt very rushed.  When I take lunch, I try to slow down. Isn't lunch a break from the rush at work? I have to say they're efficient and the order comes out right, though.  If I'm going to spend that much for lunch, I'll go to the less-busy organic grocers, the one across the street. See my review on that."}
{"text":"I came here to study for a little bit. I was here for about 3 hours and I wasn't bothered.  I ordered a sandwich which wasn't my favorite but filled my tummy up while I was here.  Caramel latte is good. I'd come back here to study or eat."}
{"text":"Just grabbed a quick snack. The banana was good. Otherwise far from my favorite bakery"}
{"text":"Used to love eating here, but quality has declined & cost has increased. Food is ok, but the value leaves a lot to be desired--$3.99 for a fruit cup? More than $8 for a sandwich? Do yourself a favor & head over to Zupas--the food is better & value is far superior, especially their kids meal."}
{"text":"4:20pm  just walked in and then turned around and left! First time I've ever seen a Paradise Bakery that dirty!"}
{"text":"One place that I love coming to is this place. I know I can depend on this place for a good breakfast, lunch or dinner. I was flying out of Phoenix and I desperately needed food before I dealt with TSA, and flying. I ended up buying the power protein sandwich which was a very reasonable price. $5 in an airport for a good sandwich. I'm down!!  Anyways they took my order and it took about five minutes to make my sandwich. The power sandwich had whole grain bread,  egg whites, white Vermont cheddar and lean ham. The ham and egg tasted so good. And the bread was very hearty and delicious. It made eating healthy be delicious. I really enjoyed my sandwich and it kept me full until lunch time!!"}
{"text":"Paradise Bakery is a place to go for consistently tasty sandwiches and salads. This particular one makes their food extra well."}
{"text":"Second visit to the restaurant and I must say that the pasta salad is phenomenal.  This place is in the Panera family but offers so much more,  I find myself wishing there was one of these in San Diego.   I will definitely be back to eat when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Yep, I had a salad for lunch today. A nice manly, Southwest Chicken Caesar salad. I threw the girls at this new Paradise Bakery location a curveball and ordered the large with two chocolate chip cookies to go. They hit it out of the park. My plastic salad container was filled to the max. Plus it had tons of spicy, chipotle caesar dressing. Just the way I like it."}
{"text":"They have the best chocolate chip cookies. You can also buy a giant chocolate chip cookie here for special occasions. I have friends who don't like birthday cake so I get them a giant cookie from here instead.   The have decent salads, great muffins and quiche and their Paradise Club is served on a croissant and is quite yummy. It can be pricey for a sandwich, but luckily my office caters lunch for us from here quite often so I get to enjoy it for free."}
{"text":"Walnut chicken sandwich is my favorite here! AND it comes with a chocolate chip cookie!! Awesome :)"}
{"text":"Great location across the mall. Provides a great option for food. Broccoli and cheddar soup is the reason why I come here. Always clean and customer service is top notch. Plenty of seating room. Will surely come back"}
{"text":"So,  we decided to try out the new steak salad wraps.  While we did not realize that the steak was going to be cold and the steak had a lot of fat on it and it was not cut up too.    Hopefully next time when we go back to Paradise Bakery we will try something better.  Normally everything here is great.    Also the customer service was great and the Cafe was really clean."}
{"text":"The setup of this company's order process always frustrates me a little. You're in line waiting but people are moving forward in front of you because they are done ordering at their particular station. It's just a cluster in my opinion.   The food is pretty average for what you get. On this visit it took more than 15 minutes to get my noodle bowl which is much too long for a quick lunch spot. Most of the time the service is very fast.   I will probably return to one of their locations at some point but I would never go out of my way to stop here."}
{"text":"It is nice and quiet at 6.00 am . The food is above average  and price is reasonable."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service.  We went to Paradise at 6:25pm (they close at 7pm) and as we approached they shut off their lights to deter customers from ordering. According to the receipt, a man named Rodney took our order (two chicken cobb salads with avocado). He was very rude and seemed more interested in closing shop than helping customers. He didn't even give a simple \"thank you\" or \"have a great night\" after we ordered. When we got our salads we noticed that there was no avocado on them, and when we asked if they had run out of avocados, we were told that they forgot and went out back to get an avocado for us, and then asked if we could cut it by ourselves...all of this while turning customers away while still open. Really unfortunate that customer service levels can be this bad. Ruined the entire experience. Would give this a 0 star rating if possible."}
{"text":"When the only thing that will satisfy my hunger is a really good salad, I go to Paradise Bakery. My only complaint with this location is that if you order your salad to go, expect the plastic container to only be half full. This doesn't happen at the other locations I've been to. On the plus side, the cookies are buy one get one free."}
{"text":"This location has the worst customer service. I have never been treated so rudely at any panera or paradise bakery. We love this place but we were in shock with the way we were treated. My husband and I sat down to eat dinner... The food was good per usual. Before we were finished eating one of the employees came over and asked to take our plates. It was clear we weren't done but I could tell they may be closing soon so I removed my cookie from my plate and said sure you can take them. Being 9 months pregnant I quickly ate my cookie and my husband and I were ready to go. We went over to the drink fountain machine to fill our to go cups and both machines had been turned off. I looked at the clock and it said 8:03pm. I didn't realize they closed at 8pm but still found it extremely rude as the manager watched us trying to fill up our cups and didn't say anything at all. Might have been a little more considerate for employee to ask us if we would like a refill before they shut off the machines as she was grabbing our plates before we were finished... Or even have the manager say something to us instead of staring at us awkwardly as if he couldn't wait for us to leave. I won't stop going to panera or paradise but it will be a long time before I go back to this location. Very disappointed with the poor customer service and inconsideration from this staff, which obviously trickles down from the leadership."}
{"text":"Been to this location twice, and both times have been extremely disappointed with the service (The food was decent).  The most recent time went for breakfast.  Only one person working the cash registered and the line was long.  That took about 10 minutes.  After waiting 10 minutes for food (omelet), a staff person stopped by to ask what we had ordered.  Told them and they disappeared.  After waiting another 5 minutes (15 since ordering),  I went to check on the food.  I was told that they had \"screwed it up\" and that it was on it's way.  At the 20 minute mark, our food arrived.  The person bringing it to the table said sorry for the delay, but it wasn't sincere.  Food quality was OK.  When I got home, I filled out the survey on the receipt stating pretty much the same as here.  The following Monday I did get a call from the manager and he said that they've been having some \"issues.\"  He said he would send some coupons for my trouble.  It's been a week and nothing has arrived, most likely I'd use them at a different location anyway.  By The Way....Paradise used to proudly proclaim that they made the bread fresh daily at the locations.  This is no longer the case (Actually I don't think it was ever the case)."}
{"text":"I love Paradise Bakery. It's a great place for healthier options that are quick and easy.  The salads are large and hearty, even for a big eater like me."}
{"text":"On November 19, 2012 we were traveling to NYC for Thanksgiving. As things worked out, we arrived at the Airport early to avoid the morning rush hour traffic with the idea of having breakfast at the airport. Terminal 4-for breakfast is a poor choice. Our Gate was located at the other end of the terminal. We checked our area and there really was nothing appealing. Therefore we commuted to Paradise Bakery at the opposite end of the terminal.   We finally arrived at 8AM finding the table space limited. I just love those people who park themselves at a table while surfing the Internet on their computer. Maybe this guy just had a cup of coffee some time ago but he wasn't going to move. I guess, in today's world, it was a case of I was here first, so F you and everyone else looking for a place to eat! This reminds me of my 5AM daily bus ride into NYC with people talking loudly on cellphones! I fixed that with a cellphone jammer. Maybe I should make an Internet Jammer so that these table hogs will relocate?  At the counter, we ordered a Bacon Turkey Bravo with chips & drink and one order of Cherry Granola Oatmeal with a small coffee. Finally a table was opened for us to eat at. The food was standard Paradise Bakery items with the same quality that you obtain outside of the Airport. This was the best we could find while waiting for our US Airways flight."}
{"text":"Awesome food (always has been) BUT, management should not be allowed to get away with their latest scheme: less food, higher prices, and more purchases required to earn the same rewards, all in one fell swoop.  That's like a triple-price increase!  It's easy to spot your BS, Paradise.  I am still hungry, my wallet is leaner and now I have to come back 2 additional times to earn that free lunch.  I am becoming a MUCH less loyal customer these days.    Even as I eat this very lunch from Paradise as I type, I am filled with feelings of resentment and frustration.  Is THAT the taste you want left in people's mouths after eating your food??"}
{"text":"Barely mediocre. They sell coffee, but they have no milk for that coffee. Only a bunch of oddly flavored creepers. Terminal 2 is kind of a dump. This is probably your best bet for coffee if you want a place to sit."}
{"text":"This location ALWAYS surpasses my expectations and not to mention, they make the most delicious and creative cookie cakes ever. My boyfriend was SO surprised by his! Thank you for always being so amazing and doing whatever is takes to make our experience a great one!"}
{"text":"Friendly service, good food. Ridiculously slow. 5 people behind the counter and fewer in line and still almost 15 minutes to microwave a cup of oatmeal and deliver it mostly warm. It's an airport- not everyone has time to stand around and watch incompetence play out."}
{"text":"Horrible management. After watching the manager talk down and belittle her employees in front of guests the entire 15 minute wait to get the wrong sandwich this is a stop I won't be making again at the airport."}
{"text":"Not impressed. The coffee is awful! Shouldn't it taste fresh brewed in the early a.m.? For some reason I decided to get a breakfast bagel sandwich which was nothing special. Most importantly though, the service sucked. We were the only ones in line but the girl behind the counter said to us 3 times, I can help you down here when you're ready. Okay, I get it! I don't see what her point was though cause she was rude and pushy when we did finally place an order."}
{"text":"Food is always fresh! There are many choices and staff are always helpful and friendly. This is NOT your typical mall food place with teenagers who could care less. These folks are warm and full of suggestions. Great job folks!"}
{"text":"This place is right by my work so more often than not I find myself in here grabbing a quick bite only because I'm pressed for time and I'm sick of everything else in the food court. Maybe 8 out of 10 times they either get my order wrong or forget/run out of something. Sometimes they're out of the dinner rolls, or chocolate chip cookies, or maybe they won't put any cheese on something that really needs it to be worthwhile. Most of the time their customer service is alright though; the cashiers are normally very friendly and the food comes out quickly despite business levels. Sure, I can deal with a chain place like this being a little inconsistent, but for the prices they charge and how wholly underwhelming the food always ends up being, my visits here are probably going to stay limited to the nights where I don't have much time for anything of real substance and I want to eat something with a vegetable in it instead of just getting a slice of pizza."}
{"text":"This Paradise Bakery is in the Terminal 4 at Sky Harbor. It has been here for many years and they are always changing it up and cleaning it up. It is a nice place in between US Airways and Southwest. Something I found out a few days ago,They are Open 24 hours a day! Yes, it is true. I went there about 8:45 Monday night to pick up my girlfriend from the airport.They seemed like everyone was around the check out. I said are you closed already, they said, No,we are open 24 hours a day. I had to ask if I had heard right? This is a first for Sky Harbor. They have never had anywhere open 24 hours before. WOW, so if you are ever stuck there this is the place to go. They have lots of seating and by the way ,they food is good. Nice coffee and some really great little cookies."}
{"text":"Paradise Bakery is a great place for a quick breakfast or lunch. Their pastries are pretty good and A+ for the iced tea. I have been eating at Paradise Bakeries (mainly in California) for the last 10 years, and have never been disappointed with the quality of the food. Rewards card = great. We get free pastries or sodas all the time. Also love the buy 1 get 1 free cookies, and the free cookie when you get a sandwich.  However, I really despise the layout of this location. First, there's a cookie/pastry counter with a register. Then there's a sectioned-off line for salads, sandwiches, and soups. If you don't want a sandwich, you have to awkwardly pass people to get to the salad station. Same goes for soup. The menu wraps around above where the stations are, so god forbid you want a sandwich/soup combo and don't know what the soups are. You then have to do some strategic neck-cringing to see the choices, or decide on the spot when you get to the next station. There are also different prices for the combos based on if you are getting a premium sandwich and normal salad, normal sandwich and premium salad, etc. So if you don't have the menu memorized, prepare to be confused."}
{"text":"This place is always packed and loud but the food is good. Its a little on the expensive side but it's the Biltmore and Paradise serves fresher, healthier food than other restaurants so I'll accept that. They do great to customize your order to your specifications. For example, I'm always able to create my own sandwich or get extra cheese on my soup. The reps are helpful if not friendly or overly zealous to attend to you but that could be expected of a place so busy. I always enjoy the free wifi, I didn't think I was a huge Paradise fan until I traveled out of state and was sincerely bummed when I couldn't satisfy my Paradise craving because Paradise isn't in Cali :("}
{"text":"We walked into an empty restaurant and commented how they're usually so busy. We soon realized why when Carla was as rude as possible when taking our order and gave her own dinner priority as she had the line servers make her a salad and pack her a bag of food and cookies while we waited. Eventually she handed over our simple order of macaroni and pushed us out the door almost an hour before closing. She never bothered to ask if we wanted to eat in. She wasn't the only unpleasant face but she was definitely the most sour and because of her we will go elsewhere in the future."}
{"text":"I love this place however they have cut down on portions significantly! I typically get a chicken walnut sandwhich which is just filling enough for lunch. Now it's like the size of a half sandwich! 2 bites and you are done! Not worth the $8 sandwich if you ask me."}
{"text":"At first I thought there were 3 employees- turns out there were 5. The only one working hard was the older woman cashier. She told a male employee in Spanish to get his a$$ moving. The other employees were either slow or crabby.   It would also be nice if they posted the price of their bagels. After the wait to get it we didn't have time to go anywhere else.  The food was barely ok. Basically they know they have you since you're at the airport."}
{"text":"I have the Loyalty Card and now have 407 documented visits to Paradise Bakery. It would at be another 50 if I had gotten the loyalty cards sooner. So obviously I have enjoyed the food and service over the years. The workers are awesome and provide great service. However Ive notice a drop in quality of the food over the past year and recently an increase in price. On this visit my granddaughter ordered a bowl of Mac and Cheese. The bowl is not that much bigger than the cup, but including tax it was $8.63.  I paid for it because she was hungry. But $8.63? Come On Man! Its MAC N CHEESE! I was in so disbeleif that I went back to double check if the cashier made a mistake, but no, $8.63 is what a bowl of MAC N CHEESE COST at Paradise Bakrery. I went right next door to Chick Filet and got a Chicken Salad sandwhich, a 6 pc grill chicken nugget, sliced potatoes, Chocolate milk for $10.96. Thats only $2.33 more than just the bowl of mac n chees.  Im not sure if the quality decrease has anything to do with Panera, but someone in corporare needs to listen to the customers, especailly one thats been there as much as I have. 407 x an average of $15.00 a visit is $6105.00. I wonder how many other Loyal customers are deciding to spend thier money elsewhere. Lots of competition next door..."}
{"text":"I'm not going to lie to you, I'm not a fan of Paradise Bakery. I think it's expensive, pretentious, foods no good, and just the epitome of everything fake and bad in Scottsdale.    But I do have to say, I have invented the best dang sandwich Paradise Bakery could possibly make for you. Check it out, it's simple. Ham & Swiss on a croissant! Also get it without that crumby mustard sauce they wanna put on it. Just croissant, ham, Swiss, mayo, and regular mustard and this is basically the best sandwich the PB can make you! (But fair warning, it will be expensive.)   Also I want to say that their croissants are not even that good. When the dude you work with starts telling you how PB's croissants are \"to die for\" you immediately tell him he's a momma's boy for saying that horse trash and then call him out on the internet. That's right, I'm stating that these croissants are a'ight and since I did it right here on Yelp, I freakin' win because someday in the future some kid is going to be writing his research paper on Paradise Bakery and come across my Yelp account and he'll be all, \"and they had a'ight croissants!\" (Spohn, Yelp).    I need to get another thing off my mind, this sandwich didn't come with that pasta salad. You have to pay extra for it and it's like $5 or something. Meanwhile the sandwich comes with a cookie was like $9 and then a drink was like $3, so seriously, this was a $16 or $17 lunch! Funk that!!! Don't buy the pasta. It's not that good or worth it. $5 could feed a college student Ramen noodles for a month.  Also let's talk about the cookie. Ya'll are on crack thinking PB has the best cookies. They're not even cooked all the way and not in the that, \"Yum! so soft and fresh way,\" but like they are straight up, not even done cooking way. Cookies suck yo."}
{"text":"I was waiting for my flight out of Arizona and needed a coffee to make it through this late flight.  I ended up getting a coffee and cookie.  All in all, the one employee that serviced me was extremely friendly and helpful.  I can't say the same about the rest of the crew."}
{"text":"Big fan of all of the Paradise Bakeries.  This one is as good as the rest, solid food, new menu items (try the new warm pastas!).  Love that you can grab iced coffee as a beverage choice at the fountain/tea area.  The one negative with this location is I typically see a number of older customers sitting in booths (one to a booth) surfing the net.  These are not salesmen checking emails over lunch, these look like guys that don't have the net at home and are just hanging out which takes these table off the market and makes the experience a little less enjoyable.  I don't have a solution to this issue but just a gentle call-out to those that enjoy the free net, avoid 11:30-1 PM"}
{"text":"I really like this Paradise Bakery location!  So this is one of my go-to breakfast spots in the Biltmore when I want to get out for breakfast. I'm already partial to the mall that this Paradise sits in, but still, this really is a great location. The food there has always been excellent in my view, and the juice is always fresh and great.   I normally opt for the steel-cut oatmeal with strawberries. It is never a bad choice at this location. The brown sugar on top is excellent and it is one of the better bowls of oatmeal you can get in my humble view.   This place has wifi, the ambiance is nice, and the place is always clean. The other thing I like is that when I've gone in the mornings, it is never too busy or crowded to get a seat. This place seems to get overlooked a bit, compared to other places nearby.   I look forward to coming back for some great oatmeal and juice! 4-stars overall!"}
{"text":"Paradise Bakery is one of those places where we use to go at least once a week or more. The cookies are great and the food is very interestingly prepared, BUT with the recent menu changes the quantity of the meats and therefore quality of the food has gone down.  Sorry! I really want to like this place.   For example, my family came here recently for lunch and for the three of us the meal cost $33.35. That is one full sandwich, and two 1/2 sandwiches with soup or salad and some cookies to take home for later. My sandwich had only four thinly slices of meat and cheese.  At what point does the lack of substance outweigh the interestingly prepared food?  Like I said I want to like this place, but they're not making it easy."}
{"text":"Slow and unfriendly service and they always seem to run out of menu items.  It is in a convenient location in Terminal 2, but would opt for somewhere else, if the choices were better."}
{"text":"I finally checked out this new location today and used the drive thru. I give this location four stars because they have the nicest employees. They were fast and friendly from the minute I pulled up to place my order.  Honestly, I don't go to Panera that often because I think they are a bit pricey. A whole sandwich, chips, and a lemonade was over $11.00. I ordered the Turkey bacon Bravo sandwich on white bread. There was plenty of meat and cheese but the bread is so thick it ends up being a bit much. The sandwich is however quite tasty. Their kettle chips and lemonade are also good."}
{"text":"As a guy I often think of Paradise as a place where the ladies go to eat and socialize.  Not so,  many business men are eating here and for good reason  the good is very good as is the selection. Try the Pick Two you get choice of salads, pastas, soups and half sandwiches, any and all freshly made and so delicious.  You even get a cookie with your sandwich.  Recently merged with Panera they will soon have shuffles on the menu. Try it you will not be sorry."}
{"text":"Do not eat here.  This location absolutely does not live up to Paradise Bakery standards. The two sandwiches we got were both absolutely disgusting. Inedible, even. For about $8.50 per sandwich, you're better off getting a feast at Wendy's a little farther down the terminal.  There were 3 employees visible behind the counter, none of whom knew the ingredients on either of the sandwiches I asked about. I specifically asked about tomatoes on one of them multiple times and the guy asked his co-worker about the sauce instead. Eventually I gave up and ordered it anyways. Lo and behold, big juicy tomatoes on the sandwich. They also communicated from the register to the kitchen something about \"just\" getting a sandwich out of the freezer and putting bacon on it. Yum.  There's not much to say about the sandwiches themselves other than the fact that I kind of wanted to throw up after trying to choke half of it down.  Since this airport location seems to be overlooked by Paradise Bakery as a whole, I'll be sending them a letter as well as posting this review.  Like I said, I strongly suggest avoiding this place."}
{"text":"I love me some Paradise Bakery cookies, but the staff here has such a bad attitude! They never smile and always have this look like you are burdening them with your presence. I used to work at a Paradise Bakery when I was in high school and my former boss would be raising hell if he saw these guys' sorry attitudes. Go for the food - but don't expect much from the service."}
{"text":"Terrible Service, food was ok but expensive since Panera took over, sooooo cheap, 1 oz of chicken weighed out for salads, no more cookie with meals, just felt  very cheap and frugal in what you get for the price, will just maybe go for meeting someone for muffin or coffee, will not be eating here again"}
{"text":"Great selection of sandwiches, soups and salads.  Prices are a little high, but the food is superb, so if you don't mind spending some mula head here for some great eats.  Nice selection of fresh baked cookies too, 2 for 1 makes it an appealing daily snack."}
{"text":"I spent over $30 for two half sandwiches, two half salads and a cup of mac and cheese. The mac and cheese was good and the salads were okay but the sandwiches were sub par. Airport prices are always high but it still seemed excessive. It also didn't help that both sandwich orders were messed up. They forgot the bacon and avocado, which were 2 of the 3 main components, of my girlfriend's sandwich."}
{"text":"The Paradise Club is amazing! The sandwich was super delicious with the beef and sweet mayonnaise sauce. The service here was excellent that when we wanted our sandwich cut or wanted to add soup later, they didn't hesitate to customize it for us. Each order of a sandwich comes with a nice sized cookie so if the sandwich doesn't fill you up, the cookie will.  Order the tomato soup because it was the best thing I had all day. It was super hot and just sweet enough that it makes your cheeks fill with joy."}
{"text":"Don't forget to grab some food before boarding the plane! This is a great stop before your flight.   I love grabbing a sandwich, scoring a cookie, and then once I'm in the air, eating leisurely. It takes me back to the days of having mom fix a special school lunch or something...not sure why because I only feel this way about Paradise Bakery in an airport.   Enjoy your next flight!"}
{"text":"So, I'm moving PB from two stars to three stars based on my lunch at the Tempe Marketplace location about a week ago.  Although, I am still not a huge fan of this place, it was a pretty OK lunch based on what we ordered.  I notice that they have discontinued the regular plates/bowls for eat in orders and have resorted to plastic containers (cheap in my opinion), however, this is probably being too picky.  We shared the BBQ Chopped Chicken Salad and the Chipotle Club Wrap, both were loaded with dressing/sauce, but had a really good flavor.  Overall, a very filling and satisfying lunch.  I'm not a sweets person, but my mom said that the chocolate chip cookie was one of the best she's had.  So, I guess I'll be back to PB when my dining companion suggests it.  Otherwise, you'll probably find me at a chinese buffet or a divey mexican joint ending in ***bertos."}
{"text":"There are definitely better office spots in the area, but this Paradise location is certainly A-OK. I don't need to say anything about the cookies--I wake up dreaming about them like everyone else. But when I'm at Paradise, my main goal is always getting some serious work done. The unlimited refills and yummy (though a bit overpriced) food are a plus. The noisy crowds, death-derby match for booths, and stingy 30-minute wifi limit during lunch hours are not. (Of course, if you sit in the right spot you can always pick up the Apple Store's wifi when they cut you off.) Overall a solid second-tier option when I'm sick of my usual laptop haunts. And yeah... cookies."}
{"text":"Really tasty! I had the Cuban chicken panini and a small coke which was about $11.  The panini was very tasty, flavored nice with some spicy pickles. It is advertised as a chicken Cuban sandwich with ham, although it seemed there was more ham than chicken. Of course the cookie was wicked good--about how you would cook it at home, all soft in the middle. I found the seating very limited given the popularity of the place and might suggest \"bar seating\" around the perimeter versus the tables. There were a lot of (about 7 or 8) employees behind the counter, so the food came fast, although I might ask one of them to pay a bit more attention to the cleanliness of the tables (given, it may be a bit if a challenge to clean between customers). All in all very good and can't wait to check out what else is in the menu!"}
{"text":"When in Rome; right?  When you have a short layover, geopgraphy rules. The other choice is taco's and other non boarding or lap friendlyfoods--you go here.  I haven't done any reserach but if this restuarant isn't owned by Panera (in some shadow way) then Panera should sue them.   It reminds me of a place I went to in Amsterdam in 1997 called Wings.  There were very attractive young busty women in tiny blue shorts and tiny white handkerchief blouses.  They changed the uniform color and had mayonaise for the pomme frites...other than that?  So this Panera \"clone\" is okay, its food,  the sandwich was pricey (probably airport mark-up at this location) and not that special-the bread seemed \"store-bought\" and the turkey was grocery store grade.  The cookies are good, however; sugary and dripping with fat.  I did see someone else mention service. They have a bad production set-up and workflow and the kids working don't really care (I understand that, sadly) and hundreds of rushed angry people a day can't be any fun.  However, noticing the sandwich in front of you and calling out the number should be a minimum requirement.  When I noticed my number had been skipped, I waited jealousy while a few more people behind me in line were fed and walked back over and asked about it.   The young woman looked at me blankly; then down at the sandwich on the counter.    A pause for a few more seconds, then, \"Oh yeah, forty-six\".  I took my sandwich and walked away worried about our society's future."}
{"text":"Super disappointed with my takeout experience from this Paradise location. I stopped in to get a whole chicken salad sandwich amongst other things. When I got home I was surprised to find half of a tuna sandwich in place of my chicken salad sandwich.  Worst part I didn't realize it was tuna until I took a bite.... I am allergic to tuna.   Now I get that mistakes are made and that is ok but the real kicker was the service I got from the manager when I called in to inform them of the mix up. The manager apologized for the mishap but would only offer me a remake of my sandwich or a free meal next time I went in. I told him that that location was 20 minutes away from me and not remotely convenient I just happened to stop in there on my way home from a doctors appointment.  Even after hearing this, the manager still had no other solutions. How about a refund or at the very least send me a gift card?? I expect a lot more from a manager after finding out his restaurant served a guest something they were allergic to."}
{"text":"Ok, I've ordered Paradise to go from work but never stepped foot in one until today. I had a haircut next door and decided to try it for lunch. I was really surprised by how big it was. It was cute too, as much as a school lunch-line type place can be. They definitely wanna pack as many warm bodies as they can in there so some of the tables were triple stacked. Wow. Not really my idea of a \"friendly neighborhood bakery\". Anyway- I decided on a salad and just watched helplessly as the guy behind the clear partition slopped my salad together. I looked to find something that I could ask him to add that would make my salad special, but nothing really fit the bill. I really like customizing my food though, so I sprayed it with cholula(sp?) at the condiment/drink island. I had a full size BBQ chicken salad and all I could think-even after the second dousing of hot sauce, was Ehh. Underwhelmed for 10 bucks. Oh well. I know plenty of people love it, I'm just not one of them."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a bite of breakfast and a coffee with the kiddo.  They'd been open not very long but the selection on the pastries was slight.    Coffee was great, the breakfast sandwich was fine (but a tad greasy), but I still expect more, I guess.  I worked for PB when I was younger and I just don't feel like (on this day at least) it was up to par."}
{"text":"Paradise Bakery was a new restaurant concept for us when we moved to the Valley a few years ago.    I have looked into the chain and was surprised by how the corporation has changed hands a few time.  Well, you would never know from the food preparation that they were a castoff.    The service is great!    The food is great!    And, they seem to have several convenent locations.    WOW!~"}
{"text":"This is the best Paradise bakery in the valley due to the inclusion of Panera items. If you're from back east you will love having access to your Panera favorites.  It has the best of both worlds with the great Panera bagels, best entrees from both restaurants, and cookies from Paradise. You will not be sorry you chose to eat here."}
{"text":"This is the only place to eat inside Terminal 2, so during my layover, I was starving and had no other choice (other than chex mix & candy at the newsstand next door). I was going to pass it up and wait but one of the workers handed me a sample cookie and it was pretty delicious, so I figured I would give it a try.   I had a breakfast bagel sandwich. It was OK at best. My bagel was a bit burnt and it was microwaved scrambled eggs (not surprisingly). I asked for avocado slices and got pasty guacamole instead. One star for the bagel.   I ordered a half dozen \"chippers,\" yummy little cookies. They are pretty damn scrumptious; not the best I've ever had but i was satisified.   Eat here if you're famished but if not, get food elsewhere. It's pricey - my bagel was $5.79!"}
{"text":"Great service, food is consistent and really good.  It is what I expect Paradise Bakery to be."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure I've had better tasting microwaved TV dinners. Being our first time visiting a Paradise Bakery we were a little confused where we order, no one was around & we just kinda stood there at the wrong side, lost. Finally placed our order & by the time we sat down our food was being delivered. I ordered their steak & cheese panini & alfredo tortellini. Panini was okay for the first few bites but the rest was fat & grizzle. Yuck. Alfredo was nothing special, honestly reminded me of cafeteria food. The reason I added one extra star was because of their delicious iced tea & free cookies! Next."}
{"text":"Look, if you're in the airport, this is one of the least offensive places you can go. It's fresh bread, freshly shipped in ingredients, nothing is fried, and it's all assembled before your very eyes.  I grabbed a turkey and avocado sandwich, and it did the trick. I was plenty hungry, and even though it wasn't a ton of food, I got the whole sandwich and a drink for around $10 (that's not too offensive in airport terms) and it came out quick. The quick part is a bog bonus when it comes to airport food.  And yes, I will also mention the free cookie. I think I got one of yesterday's cookies, because it wasn't the soft and delectable cookie that I'm used to. It was still okay, but it had kind of a hard crunch to the shell. But I'm not going to look a gift cookie in the mouth.  Nothing to be offended by. Grab a sandwich, maybe some soup, perhaps a salad, or go hog wild and get a panini. Good beverage choices and even fruit to select as your side."}
{"text":"Ate: Half a chipotle chicken sandwich and half southwestern salad  $: Too much money for a sandwich and salad that barely fill you up. If they don't give you that 'free' cookie I'd probably have to spend 12-13$ for a decent amount of food.  Recent experience: Asked for spinach on my salad and the lettuce that was already in my to-go box (less than when you eat there) seemed to rub the worker the wrong way so she removed half of it. Suffice it to say, my salad didn't even cover the bottom of the box. Not enough chicken, not enough ingredients and she was incredibly rude about it. She talked about hating how customers asked for extra things. To be honest the ingredients cost next to nothing for the corporation let alone the employee. I am not expecting a pound of chicken but someone in management needs to do something about it. Otherwise they will lose customers daily due to their service and how cheap they are.   I did however appreciate some of their employees who were very kind. For the most part I would not go back here unless I was dragged back in. The taste of food is important but so is service and quantity.   No thanks."}
{"text":"You see this place in many airports but this one didn't have the freshest food.  The cinnamon roll was drier but still delicious.  I assume they bring everything in from somewhere else as it is too small looking to cook pastries.  Still I am coming back as I liked their coffee with rolls."}
{"text":"Food, coffee, & tea are pretty good. Iced tea costs $3 a cup, but they will overfill the cup with ice. Then they have a sign that says they do not do refills, citing some gibberish about \"heath code reasons\" or whatnot. I know for a fact that this is not true, as l have worked in several restaurants myself. We asked a manager at another Paradise Bakery about this & they said that this is completely out of policy. I tried to look for a corporate phone number on the company website, but evidently there is none. I do understand that many of the locations are franchisees, but this is no way to run a company. Won't return~"}
{"text":"I've started going to the Paradise Bakeries for one reason - free wi-fi. Make that two reasons - free wi-fi and close to my house. Make that three reasons - free wi-fi, close to my house, and the tomato soup.  A decent work away from work place with plenty of outlets and booths but I've been to the Marketplace and the one in Chandler (I-10 & Ray) and both are too cold to make you want to stay long, even in the summer. Still, that tomato soup is a good warm up..."}
{"text":"This place is usually more on point, sadly not today...I ordered a pickup meal, grilled cheese and small soup, called it in asked for it to be ready in 10, and almost 20 mins later I come to pick up my food and it hasn't even been started. Mind you there are 5 employees plus the general manager standing back behind the counter, in fact it was the manager who took my order over the phone. I will no longer come back to this location, always seems to be something and the GM didn't even really seem to blink or find it a problem that my food hadn't even been started. Shame really wasn't busy, no line, just really bad service."}
{"text":"I have been to this location for lunch about 6 times so far.  I love the salads and LOVE the cookies.  Their sandwiches on the other hand can use some work.  Paradise Bakeries around the valley have had the same sandwiches for forever.  They NEED some new stuff.  The prices are reasonable for the size of the meal you get and the service is always pretty good.  My only issue is with the giant g-d damn clusterfuk that ensues when the place is busy.  The whole process of ordering your meal and paying for it can be a bit confusing and a hassle.  I can't really describe it but if you've ever been there then you know what I mean.  Anyway, I am a fan of Paradise and will continue to go even though it can be a pain."}
{"text":"Prime location and a convenient stop. It's your typical Paradise Bakery, but nothing over-the-top special.   I ordered the soup in the bread bowl. The presentation could have been better. They took the top off the bread, scooped out a bit of the bread and filled it with the soup. I guess I had in mind more bowl and less eating an entire roll.   The best part here are their cookies...and location."}
{"text":"If you have no time to grab something before arriving at the airport, Paradise Bakery may be one of the best food choices you can find.  Yes, it offers over-priced mediocre food as expected, but I appreciated the fact they offered a vegetarian sandwich ($8 or so) along with some pasta salad ($5). The sandwich had some cucumber, lettuce, tomato, and Havarti (my favourite cheese) and came with a chocolate chip cookies. The pasta salad was overly dressed, but it had some veggies in it and tasted OK.  In a pinch, this place will do, but we all know it is best to leave early so that you can get something decent to eat before arriving at the airport!"}
{"text":"Very rare to find fresh-tasting food at an airport. I stopped by when I first arrived in Phoenix, for a quick bite before starting my day. I had a half tuna sandwich and small salad. They give you a free chocolate chip cookie.   The tuna sandwich was just OK. The bread and toppings are delicious, but the tuna reminds me of the tuna at Panera - not my favorite. The bread really is tasty.  I had the blue cheese salad - very good. When I grabbed some grub to take on my flight back home, I ordered the salad with the dressing on the side. I also had a half veggie sandwich and substituted avocado for roaster red pepper. I would definitely go back and would recommend it. Hard to find food in the airport that is not fried.  The service was really delightful. Both times I went, the people behind the counter were super sweet and friendly. It was a nice way to start and end my little trip to Phoenix."}
{"text":"The food is consistently the same at all Paradise Bakeries but what a difference management makes.  If you compared this location to the location at 67th and 101, you would never think they are part of the same chain.  We have consistently stood in front of the soup line making eye contact with 3-4 different staff members...they all look away.  You don't know if only certain, select people at this location can ladle a bowl of soup.  We have had so many poor experiences at this location, we finally decided to go a little further and frequent the location at 101 and 67th...what a difference supervision makes and professional management."}
{"text":"Amazing that this is the same chain as the 99th and Happy Valley Location.  The food is the same in both places but the service at the 67th and 101 location is heads and shoulders above the Happy Valley location.  Great customer service at the 67th and 101 operation.  Oh yeah, love the cookies!  The wifi is a nice touch too."}
{"text":"Sure, everyone knows Paradise Bakery as an affordable, well diverse menu for any lunch taste.   But my review is for their stellar management and delivery service who continue to service me and my clients in a timely manner, and always aim to please!   A fantastic choice for any of your catering needs! Thank You Paradise Bakery!   (ok, I'm hungry now...can you please open in California?! :)"}
{"text":"Uninspiring and lackluster thai chicken salad. Some of the ingredients such as the edame and red bell peppers were not fresh at all and tasted like they had a bit of freezer burn. This location is just a good place to meet a group of friends with a beverage and a scone."}
{"text":"This is our favorite location. Though it's always busy, the service is fast. The kid's meals are by far the most generous in the valley and my kids always leave happy. The only complaint is parking. I've gone several times and had to pay for the free parking. That has nothing to do with this bakery, but an issue with the shopping center.  I always opt for the Fuji apple salad or the walnut chicken salad. You cant go wrong with most sandwiches and salads here though."}
{"text":"I love Paradise Bakery, but this location at PHX seriously has the worst and slowest service ever!  Customers expect consistency from a chain like this and you guys just don't deliver at this location time after time.  On a positive note, the food is still tasty - I love the you pick 2 combo with mac 'n cheese and soup...so tasty!"}
{"text":"Oh how I love Paradise Bakery...it is one of my favorite staples in the Valley of the Sun!  I stopped into this location last Sunday for a quick breakfast - OJ and an everything bagel.  The bagel was so fresh and tasty.  The staff was great and the outdoor space is great to enjoy a nice, desert morning!"}
{"text":"Panera bought paradise and although I love paradise more.... This pantera is exceptionally nice, quiet, clean and organized! Also high tech! Come check them out :-)"}
{"text":"After waiting for 3 people in front of me to order, it wasn't turn. A woman walks up to the counter, says excuse me and starts placing an order?!!! What the heck are the rest of us waiting in line for? I complained & walked out. So rude by the customer & the employee."}
{"text":"Ordered a sandwich & iced tea for $10.40. The sandwich was a disappointment to say the least. I took a photo so you could see how little chicken salad is on a $8.50 sandwich! The chicken didn't even reach the sides of the bread."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a quick lunch and got what I would expect.  Descent food, service that is not to be impressed with because they're all just 'doing a job' and ambiance that's about sit, eat and move on.  A place you'd go to because it's there - not because you seek it out."}
{"text":"I came in with my mother on the 19th for a late dinner. She's never been to Paradise Bakery (I eat at the one in N. Scottsdale all the time) so I thought it would be a nice treat...it wasn't.   First off they rambled off a bunch of bread they didn't have which in turn meant a bunch of sandwiches they couldn't make. There really isn't a good excuse for running out of bread in a bakery, there just isn't. My mom picked a sandwich and asked for the mayo to be served on the side, simple request but she said they already premade all their sandwiches so it was take it or leave it. What? You premade all your sandwiches??? Gross  Moving on, mom picked a different sandwich, something with chicken that they could put on different bread. We both got some soup, a drink and those amazing carrot cake bites.   She opened her sandwich to take a peek and the chicken was pink. Not just a little undercooked but RAW. She took it right up to the counter and they made her a salad instead but it really grossed us both out. I will never eat chicken here and I highly doubt my mother will ever be back!!"}
{"text":"My favorite thing about this location is Stacy, she's always at the door to greet you and hold the door open on your way out. If she wasn't at the door I don't think there would ever be a straight line in that place. I love her friendly personality. She always asks how my weekend was or what's new.   The rest of the staff is hit or miss. Today I stood waiting for soup for a really long time while those making salads stood there chatting, I counted 6 folks not doing anything while I stood there waiting. Finally the cashier came over, apologized and scooped me some soup.  This happens often, no one is very attentive. The food is always consistent but service isn't.  I often get the Greek salad with no olives. So I tell the first guy no olives, then he hands the box with lettuce to the second person and says greek with no olives, she repeats \"greek with no olives\" then puts olives in the box. I then have to tell them I don't want olives and they always seem surprised despite the fact they repeated my order. This happens ALL THE TIME. It's similar to when I ask for soup to go and they ask if it's for here or to go, I tell them to-go and they put it in a regular bowl. There's not loud music. The staff just doesn't pay attention."}
{"text":"OK, I am getting tired of catching the new employees overcharging me. Every time we go there there seems to be a new wave of newbies. We go there enough and always get the same thing so I know exactly how much it is supposed to cost. The last two times there I had to have a manager (also new) cancel and re-ring my purchase. The employees always want to debate with me so I just ask for the manager to double check the total. So far I am batting 1000. Today the guy had a bit of an attitude when I busted him. I always give them my loyalty card which shows them that we have been there well over 300 times. You would think that they would train their employees to pay attention to the customer visit count, especially with super-regular customers. We were wondering how much extra money they make $2 at a time with travelers that don't know any better. I have heard that this is a training location...trial by fire I guess in this always busy shop... but then someone else said it is not. I am still suspicious of all the new employees every couple weeks.  The cookies and sandwiches are still awesome. The sandwiches may actually be the best of all the locations I go to, probably because they do so much business here that everything is always super fresh. It is hard to give the cookies less than 3 stars but if this problem persists I will be downgrading this location again."}
{"text":"Went for a quick lunch with family last week. The place is always clean and busy. I don't love places like this because they usually only have what feels like a limited menu and quick prep on the items they offer. What they do serve, they do pretty well - albeit a bit on the pricey side. As for the food, I had a big kid grilled cheese with Bacon and Tomato soup. The chocolate chip cookie is a nice touch too. I'd go here again!"}
{"text":"Went to Paradise Bakery and Cafe with my cousin, it was a Friday evening and packed but the line moved quickly. I wanted to try their meatball sandwich but unfortunately they were out of meatballs so we settled on the California Turkey instead and their chocolate chip cookies. The sandwich itself was delicious and they had some sort of basil pesto mayo on it which complimented the cucumber in it beautifully. It felt like a nice light dinner. The cookies were FANTASTIC! They were slightly chewy with huge chunks of chocolate. The chocolate was gooey and not overly sweet. Will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"I ordered the 2 for 6$ and was charged 4.19$ for a half sandwich and 5.19$ for a half pasta. WTF, does not come close to 2 for 6. I will not be back. I use to love this place."}
{"text":"Strawberry poppyseed chicken salad is the best salad ever! I know it's a seasonal item, but I'll take it while I can! Lol.  This Paradise Bakery was right across the street from our hotel room.  My choice for lunch! Super convenient! The place was busy, yet still very manageable to get in and out of. There was a little mix up with our order, but the lady at the cashier counter was super friendly and very helpful with getting our order right and done quickly!  My friend had a half a sandwich and cheddar & broccoli soup, and I had the strawberry poppyseed chicken salad. OMG! Everything was delicious! The portions were pretty generous for being just half. Loved everything! That soup was creamy and super cheesy too! Mmmm!  Thank you to that super gal at the counter, I definitely appreciate her kindness, since it can be really frustrating when it's super busy! (Got an extra cookie since they messed up my order!) Customer service is tops here!  The service and food was excellent, what more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"This review has to be scaled for the fact that this is airport food. If I ate this in a normal situation, I would call it maybe a 2 star restaurant. However, for what it is, it is rather decent. The food was decently priced, we got a good sandwich and they had good selection. I particularly was ok with the sandwich that we had, t tasted like it had ingredients which were not bad. The sandwich had bacon turkey on a tomato bread. The tomato bread was interesting. They actually seemed to understand the rules of sandwich making. Which are :  -Soft fillings should be served on soft breads. -Make sure there's a moisture barrier (i.e., something creamy or oily) between your -bread and wet ingredients (e.g., tomatoes). -Keep slippery ingredients away from each other. -Use a bread you'd be willing to eat on its own.   These are rather simple rules, but you would be surprised how often places don't understand them, and you get these sandwiches that one bite caused everything to poop out the back. The point of a sandwich is supposed to be that you can eat it easily while doing other things and not had stuff all over your hands. If the sandwich can't do that, it has failed in it's purpose of sandwichness!!!   The sandwich was almost made quickly and efficiently. I would eat here again."}
{"text":"A lousy breakfast sandwich for $7. I know airport travelers are captive diners and prices at airports reflect that. I have noticed improved quality at some airports like Orlando and Sky Harbor. This bakery/cafe is not one. If someone had me taste this sandwich with my eyes closed, I wouldn't know the ingredients. So bland and disappointing.  Walk to another concourse if you have time."}
{"text":"I always love PB.  Good and fresh and always consistent.  Salads are wonderful.  I'm giving it four stars because my husband's sandwich was a bit thin today.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Working across the street is dangerous! Damn you Paradise Bakery and your buy one get one free cookies!! I only want one cookie! My ass is getting fat!!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch, first time going there. Had the bbq chicken flatbreads which were absolutely delicious. The flavor from the spinach and cilantro, along with a little bit of heat from the bbq sauce, it was very flavorful. Only thing I didn't like was they would just yell out names rather than numbers for orders that were ready, which during lunch time when it's packed with limited seating, very hard to hear a name being called out. Other than that it was great."}
{"text":"First time here.....had the southwestern flatbread. Great flavor!! Awesome that they have multiple choices for diet soda. Employees were great! They were 10 mins from closing and gave us some extras cookies!! Thanks Alex....you're the man!! Only thing is, I hate when they are vacuuming while I eat. Maybe it's my fault for coming at closing. But wait til everyone leaves to vacuum! Overall a great first time"}
{"text":"I really like Paradise Bakery in general and have never been disappointed with the quality of the food. I really LOVE the salads here especially the Southwest Chicken Caesar and the BBQ Chicken. This is the largest location I have been to and am pleased that they have all the menu selections (some locations don't have everything like the one at Desert Ridge).   Right now they are holding a 2 for 1 cookie special and the proceeds (i think) are going to a breast cancer charity, probably SGK. And with walnut chocolate chip and chocolate chip coconut how can you not resist?"}
{"text":"Their food is okay. Nothing has ever really stood out to me (except the cookies), which is probably why I don't go in very often.  However, when I do go in, I am always reminded of the reason they will never, ever surpass three stars in my book, regardless of how delicious their cookies, or anything else they serve, is: THEIR STUPID, POINTLESS, FRUSTRATING ORDERING SYSTEM.  Honestly, I've probably gone to paradise about a half a dozen times in my life. Every single time, if you were to come up to me at my table and ask me \"How did you get your food today?\" I would be dumbfounded. I literally block it out, it is that irritating. Yes, I eventually end up at a table with a salad or sandwich, maybe a cup of soup, but no I can't help you, random stranger who also doesn't know how to order. I don't know how this happened.  A couple weeks ago my boyfriend and I went to this location.  We got to the back of the line and I literally turned to him and said \"Their ordering system is really stupid. I don't know how to work it, I just know it's stupid. Just go through and do what the employees tell you and eventually we'll have food somehow.\"  This was actually one of the more stupid Paradise ordering experiences I had ever had, so it was nice for him to experience that on his very first visit. Long story short: We ended up ordering every item from the same employee though she kept directing us down this invisible assembly line of people only to meet us at the next station and take the rest of our order there. It was very confusing. So confusing in fact that the guy in front of us got so pissed off he complained to the location manager about their restaurant ordering workflow. If random customers are complaining to store managers about corporate wide ordering policies, maybe it's time to re-evaluate your stupid system that does nothing but make people feel awkward and waste everyone's time."}
{"text":"I'm not the biggest fan of Paradise Bakery. Only because it's so busy when I go in there around meal times. However if you get there really early in the morning it's empty and everything is fresh and warm. The employees are really nice people. In fact I came in and bought the chocolate babka so often that on their last day of serving it (it was seasonal) the manager David gave me a whole babka cake on the house! So rad."}
{"text":"Was connecting in PHX and tried this place out. Found it to be mediocre to be honest. Got a Frontega chicken and it was cold and bland. Also ordered a soup which was just okay. Service was pretty lackluster as well. Won't come here again."}
{"text":"Boring boring boring....never changes or updates the menu....still not happy they switched to pepsi from coke...the menu has been the same for YEARS..."}
{"text":"Their menu is a Panera bread menu, including the Pick 2 options. They only had 2 soups to choose from but it was 9 am when we were there. All sandwiches come with a \"fresh baked chocolate chip cookie\". Good selection of cookies and pastries to choose from. Good selection of sandwiches too, and easy to get them to-go.   Line moves fast, until their computer systems went down. Not their fault but hey handled it mostly well."}
{"text":"C is for cookie and that's good enough for me.  I was first intoduced to this play by co-workers brinking back cookies. They were good but nothing special.   I poeped in for a lunch as was greeted by bread and pesto samples. A good start as I love each one of those things.  Upon looking at the menu I realized this place mostly had girl food, sandwiches, soups, salads and some breakfast  stuff.  I went for the old veggie sandwich. It was nice that it had pesto and some roasted veggies, the flavor was nice. As with most girl food places it was too small to really fill me up. and for the almost $7 it should have.  It is funny watching business people use the free wifi and try to use this spot for a business meeting as it is not really a good place for that.  If you are in the area and want more than just a Starbucks selection of girl food you may want to stop in."}
{"text":"What would you get if Panera and Piada hooked up and had a baby? This!  The first one I wandered into hungry was further up the road and I was craving a breakfast sandwich...they said sorry breakfast stops being served at 10.  Mind you it was 10:03 when I was in there.  Not happy.  But I tried the one here because the inlaws wanted to go in.  Not bad at all.  Other than not knowing where to order anything because there aren't any signs that say Order Here, the staff was friendly and the salad I had constructed for me was good.  Everything but for a few items can be included in your salad (I wanted shaved parmesan and that cost me 25cents more)  And their asiago bagel sandwiches? Oh yeah!"}
{"text":"Today was my first visit and I would go back.  I had the chicken salad sandwich, my husband had a salad (I can't remember the name) and both were delicious.  It was clean, lots of choices and reasonable prices. They had lots of delicious flavored serve-it-yourself iced teas and service was quick.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this location, it's really huge.  Service is fast and consistent.  Like all other Paradise locations, there's a great variety of menu items.  The only real downside to this location is that parking is simply awful during the lunch rush in the middle of the week."}
{"text":"I love paradise! This place has the best food and great service! Any time I go in the restaurant the workers are always very polite and friendly. It makes a huge difference when employees actually care."}
{"text":"Rude on two separate occasions. On one, the worker refused my order because they didn't have soup that my daughter wanted, which makes no sense. Instead she rudely directed us to several other restaurants by name. Does your boss know you are turning business away? On another, we tried to use a cookie coupon given to us by Blue Sky. They saw my daughter had a coupon in hand and waived her over in front of those ordering food. She ordered a cookie but when we went to pay, the cashier inspected the coupon like she'd never seen one (they're given out all the time). She then rudely told us we couldn't use it because the cookie wasn't chocolate chip. No where on the coupon did they specify cookie type. They knew my daughter was using a coupon when she ordered, why didn't they say anything then? We had added a few other items to purchase but she was so rude we left without anything. It's amazing this place stays in business."}
{"text":"Over priced.  A Ceasar Salad the size of my fist was $7.  Also, they changed the fire roasted tomato soup - seems silly, but it was my favorite thing on the menu - to something that tastes like canned, condensed soup made with extra water.  Bummer."}
{"text":"Mm it was okay. They were pretty thoughtful and asked me how I want my drink. I had their latte with candies I bought from see's"}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast sandwich anywhere! They ruined it for me,  as now they've posted nutritional information on their web site! My favorite Egg sandwich on a \"light\" croissant with melted swiss cheese and ham which is 450 calories, 29% fat. It's good that I only visit Arizona a few times per year!  The scrambled egg wrap is a whopping 760 calories.   Hmm, I'm staying off the web site and living in denial. 46g of fat in that sandwich???......really???."}
{"text":"This small Paradise Bakery in Terminal 3 is located next to a Starbucks and the little known Sky Harbor Arts and Crafts Museum which is always worth the visit. The menu is a subset of the best of a normal-sized Paradise Bakery.  The Fuji Apple salad is on the list of items which make it and my favorite part of this Paradise Bakery is they'll sell a single of their small bite sized cookies, aka \"Chippers\" while all of the other locations want you to purchase 6 Chippers.   This Paradise Bakery is consistent and their quality remains great."}
{"text":"Good parking, great location and quick service were the highlight of this Paradise Bakery location. The ambiance isn't as nice as many Paradise Bakery locations. However, there's free wifi and breakfast is definitely their best meal.  Stay away from the oatmeal as the egg dishes are better. I really miss the OJ they had when everything was fresh v out of a bottle.   Good place to eat, if you are in a hurry."}
{"text":"This Paradise bakery location in the airport is a subset of the finer Paradise locations in Scottsdale or around the Phoenix area. I though it was ok, but not great. The menu is small and the service is fair compared to others. (I must have also encountered the \"bored girl\" another Yelp reviewer spoke of.)   Anyhow, the signature orange juice wasn't here, instead it was grocery store Orange Juice.  I think I'd like to see Whole Foods open in an airport. At least the food would be good and the service predictable.   Here's my theory on PB:   Paradise is a franchise and the website says you need a high net worth to buy this shack. I've always thought this was funny. The downside of franchises is without proper corporate oversight, the franchisee will do everything to squeeze an extra penny of profit from every dollar of revenue.  PB lacks this oversight as their locations are increasing inconsistent, else the Phoenix market owner doesn't pay attention to detail.   Skip this place and try something else at breakfast. The cookies are predicable and if you want something to go, the unhealthy cookie will tide you over until the next flight."}
{"text":"This Paradise Bakery is relatively quiet as it's tucked away in a strip shopping center. It's the same food and the service was top notch. There's no ambiance....literally none in this location."}
{"text":"OMG, this place is horrible. So, for many years I've enjoyed Paradise Bakery on multiple Phoenix/Scottsdale trips. I noticed this location and had about 1 hour to kill in between 2 meetings.  First problem: Cash register is a single point of failure. There's probably 220 feet of counter space with one cash register. Really bad design!!! Of course, I go when the \"not so bright\" girl is working and the elderly man and woman change their mind and re-order the single coffee and single tea 3 different times. There's no one else working and I really need something to drink.  I'm gasping and exasperated, and at this point spot a tray of large paper cups. Though, I'm tempted to just steal a drink and leave money on the table, I remember this is Phoenix and they shoot Californians for this. So, I take my paper cup and fill it with ice water and go start using the \"Free wifi\".    After a bit, I assume the elderly couple has moved on, so I go back to order. Now she has a line because she's show and the patrons aren't helping. I go back to my laptop and get a message that my 30 minutes of free wifi is done. At this point, I'm both pissed and hungry, so I left.  This place should have their franchise licensed pulled as they give Paradise a horrible name. They left such a negative impression that I didn't visit the Scottsdale Paradise, nor will I."}
{"text":"An underwhelming experience to say the least. We stopped in for coffee, to access the web, and to hang out for a while.   The coffee was lukewarm and we never were able to access their wifi.   Before leaving, I decided to grab a salad (Chicken Caesar).  It consisted of lettuce, a couple of croutons, lettuce, a couple a minuscule pieces of chicken with a thimbleful of dressing, and more lettuce.   It was great if you were a rabbit. Not so good if it was supposed to be your dinner."}
{"text":"I never liked the way you're supposed to order your food at Paradise - it could get confusing if you have a big order and you need to keep track of all the sandwiches, salads, soups, etc... Anyhow, I still go to Paradise because the food IS tasty and their cookies are yummylicious.   Went to dinner here tonight with my husband and three little ones. I ordered our food and of course received the salads and soups right away since they serve it up while you're standing there. We sat down and waited 25 minutes (!!!) for our sandwiches and my daughter's Mac n Cheese kids meal. And we got there when it was slow! We noticed people that got there after us already had their food. Then finally a guy comes up with the wrong kids meal. Finally a manager arrived with our food. She apologized and said she would give us a refund. I thought she was going to refund a sandwich, but she ended up refunding us the full $45! For that I was grateful. While my husband was waiting for her to refund our dinner, I noticed a couple people were at the counter because their orders were wrong or they too were receiving a refund of some sort. The manager was nice. The other staff were so-so. Next time we'll go to another location..."}
{"text":"New Panera last visit.  Worst experience.  Person tells me she can't take my Panera card at the end of my order. Then over charges my credit card. After asking for them to change the Dr Pepper 3 times, I finally get told they are out (2 of the 8 choices had out of service). Then they bring us the wrong salad.  Time to find a different place to catch soup and salad."}
{"text":"Sunday morning 11am one week before Christmas. Out of plain and everything bagels. Seemed strange to be out of anything on one Of the busiest shopping weekends of the year at a mall.  The floor looked liked it could use a good mopping. It was filthy. If the floor is filthy, the rest of the places probably filthy. Guess I should be happy they were out of the bagels."}
{"text":"I work close to paradise so I've been going there for 3 years now. They use to be super nice and very professional. I almost got sick of the food so I cut it down to once a week. They eventually raised their prices and cut down their proportions A LOT! Even on the dressings it's like who can even finish their salad with such little amount??   Recently Zupas cafe opened up right next to the theaters and I've been in love ever since! A whole sandwich and salad/soup for $8.50?! With better quality and they aren't stingy over there. Anyways. Today... I realized I had a free meal at paradise, so I decided to give them another chance. As I'm ordering I confirmed with Tristi? Christy? That if I get a whole sandwich or entree pasta, can I still get a salad, and still be considered the free meal. And confirmed it and said I can get anything. So me thinking, gee what a steal, I'm gunna get pasta entree and a salad with BLUE CHEESE dressing. I go to cash out and she said she's charging me for the $12 pasta because it doesn't include the entree. I told her I asked the front lady twice and the cashier didn't even budge. Jus said sorry and asked for my card to pay. Frustrated as all hell, I went back to eat at work and the pasta was so bland. The salad didn't come with the dressing I wanted and came with a lemon and berry vinegarette. I was so disappointed. On the plus side my cookie was warm from sitting on the pasta. So thanks for the free warm cookie.  I will NOT be returning."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE, terrible customer service!!! You can't ask a question about the menu (or anything for that matter) without getting a glare... I do not recommend this place to any travelers. Their sandwiches aren't even that great (see the overly-priced yet weak sandwich in the picture). The only thing they really have going for them is the mac 'n cheese (hence the single star, but honestly they don't even deserve that). I have never been so angry or annoyed leaving a bakery/cafe. I urge you not to go here."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE, terrible service!!!!! I do not recommend any travelers to eat here. You can't ask a question about the menu, or anything for that matter, without being glared at.... The food isn't even that great (hence the photo of the weak and overly-priced half sandwich). The only thing they really have going for them is the mac 'n cheese. Again I do NOT recommend this place to travelers. I have not been so annoyed, irritated, and angry when leaving a food joint."}
{"text":"I have to say, I love my Paradise Bakery on the reg, but I can honestly say this is the first time I've been severely disappointed. The customer service here is deplorable. We came in to order dinner to go; the boyfriend ordered an easy ham and cheese sammich, no problems there. I ordered a pick two, southwest chicken caesar and a frontega chicken on ciabatta, the gal tells me they're out of ciabatta, no problem, I'll take it with the foccacia it usually comes on. She says all they have is the asiago foccacia, close enough, I'll take it. The girl seemed really rushed and gave us our total twice before we were even done ordering. We went to go get drinks (side note, all the tea except for hibiscus was out, argh!) and the sandwich gal comes up and tells me they're out of the asiago focaccia. I asked her if I could do the chicken salad sandwich instead and she looked at me confused. I found on the menu it's actually referred to as the \"chicken walnut\" so that's my bad I guess. They brought our order out and we checked our bag, no salad. I went up to the girl that rang us up and advised her we were just missing our salad and she looks at me confused and asks, \"salad?\" And I said yes, my pick two chicken caesar, she asked the salad person if she made it and they replied no, and asks me if I wanted it for here or to go. Why would I want everything to go except my salad?  Anyways, cut to getting home and there's no chicken in my southwest chicken caesar. At this point, I'm aggravated. I go to find the always included cookie to numb the pain, and low and behold the cookies are also missing, despite being included on our receipt.   We love Paradise but unfortunately we will not be returning to this location, despite the closer drive."}
{"text":"First if we didn't love Paradise AND if it wasn't for Yelp we would have never found this one. We were on our way to Mayo clinic on Shea but had time to eat. This one is hidden well. Hard to find. NEXT- this one is the first one set up like it is. \"Bass Aackwards\". If it wasn't for Bob we would not have know where to order what...... Seemed like everyone standing around except for o'Bob. When we got it figured out meal was Great As Always at paradise. I would give 5 stars for soup and sandwiches. But confusing how they do everything else"}
{"text":"Their turkey sausage spinach and egg white breakfast sandwich tasted weird. The bread was great, I should have stuck to something that was just baked. The Orange muffin was pretty decent but nothing really special. Their service was kind of slow for not being too busy."}
{"text":"Well as of tonight , Paradise Bakery will be my go to place to meet friends for a quick sandwich or coffee. We had terrific service,  great food , yummy cookies which are currently two for one on price.   While many of the items aren't the most unusual or original , they do a good job with great sandwiches and soups.  I had a chicken, artichoke cheese panini , my daughter had a blueberry muffin, friends  with me ate meatball paninis  and a chicken wrap which they loved.   And of course we all ate cookies.  Everyone I came with tonight walked away happy and with a smile.   I was also impressed with the manager. He saw that a line was building up in the line and promptly opened a second register which he ran himself. When things calmed down he walked around the store and asked people if they needed anything . Great service. That's the kind of attitude that will cause me to want to come back sooner."}
{"text":"I love Paradise Bakery & Cafe! I've visited several of their locations around the valley. It's weird that the time I decided to Yelp! about this chain, is when I visited the location at the airport. Regardless, this review could easily be for any of their other cafes.  Part of the reason I enjoy eating at Paradise Bakery is because they offer a relatively healthy comfort food menu at a reasonable price (and their prices didn't skyrocket just cause they're in the airport). I've had lunch and dinner before, but this morning's early visit to the airport called for breakfast. When I saw Paradise Bakery in Terminal 3, I knew exactly where I was going to get my coffee.  I also had a really good, but not very photogenic, Asiago Bacon and Egg breakfast sandwich. The sandwich was prepared after I ordered it and was piping hot. Way better than any fast food options that may have been nearby!  I'm glad I enjoyed breakfast here for the first time. I didn't think to ask who roasts their coffee beans, but this was a very good cup of coffee. And I'm not just saying that because I was tired. Wake up to a little bit of Paradise!"}
{"text":"I've struggled with a rating for this place for a long time and would give it a 2 1/2 stars but will round up to 3 stars since the 2 1/2 rating isn't available.  My sons had the ham and cheese sandwich and I had the Smoked Turkey Panini and my wife had a 1/2 chicken salad sandwich and a salad. The food was good and my wife really enjoyed the salad.   The Smoked Turkey Panini was A-OK, but pales when compared to a Panera bread. For example, the bread was not completely toasted on the outside. In other words, one side of the sandwich was white bread without that grilled look of a panini sandwich. My Wife's salad was delicious, the salad included walnuts, mandarin oranges, blueberries, regular lettuce, etc. and a very tasty salad dressing.  The total bill was $33.13 for 4 people without drinks. We were initially given 3 chocolate cookies for 4 people; we were given 2 sugar cookies after we alerted them of their initial shortfall. I guess they ran out of cookies."}
{"text":"I had an early morning flight and decided to grab something at the airport. Unfortunately I decided to grab a cinnamon roll at Paradise Bakery. Since I've had nothing but positive experiences with the cinnamon roll from their majority owner Panera Bread in Chicago, I thought this was a slam dunk. It was obvious to me that they served me left overs from the day before because it sure didn't taste fresh. The baker must have slept in that morning or called in sick. The service is Sloooow as well. They try to multitask and help other customers part way through my transaction, very annoying."}
{"text":"I have been to several Paradise Bakery locations over many years and this location (Scottsdale Road and Indian School Road) is terribly managed. The seats are dirty and used dishes, napkins and utensils stay wherever customers leave them. The staff is preoccupied with rolling forks inside napkins and arranging the cookie display, and are not available to take orders. One would presume that they're preparing napkins and cookies for customers, but they don't pay attention to the customers in the store...maybe this location makes most of their profit from catering or something.  The food is consistent with other Paradise Bakery locations, which is to be expected. But the untidy atmosphere and indifferent staff make this a regrettable experience. In the end, I'm the fool who came here twice in one week and had identical experiences. Lesson learned.   What?!? I can't rate this place 0 stars?? Lame. Ok 1 star = 0 stars."}
{"text":"Above average for airport food.   The service was friendly and the food was fresh.   The eating area needed a good cleaning.    A free to cookie to finish off the meal......better then expected."}
{"text":"Finally a Paradise Bakery near me! I don't have to drive all the way to Scottsdale for them anymore! No longer will my family be forced to make an adventure across the other side of town to pick up my cookie cake because I hate real cake!   Right?  Wrong. This Paradise Bakery just plain sucks. I still order my cookie cakes and cookies from here because it's convenient but I would never eat their food. I've tried eating here twice. Once an albacore sandwich that tasted like someone died inside of it (not the fish). The second time was just pasta salad. How do you mess up pasta salad? TELL ME. Another time my cousin ordered tomato soup and she found what we presumed to be part of a plastic spoon inside of it. How does that even happen? Are they intentionally messing with us or did they really just serve us used soup?  This location is always packed. I've never come here and not had to wait in line for at least ten minutes. That and the employees (besides ONE old lady who works there) are total jerks. I'm serious. Dude you work at Paradise Bakery for a living. Don't talk down to me when I'm trying to order a cookie.   I only come here to get my Mr Pibb fix or to buy my mom cookies. Their cookies are just as good as any other Paradise. I have no idea what happened to their food or who trained their employees."}
{"text":"This is a place that has been a mall and Terminal 4 at Sky Harbor (before security) and has seemed to have free standing locations popping up all over. I saw one at 67th just South of Union Hills and this one across from the mall.   My Mom told me Panera bought this place and while I could see some Panera items, this place was Panera on CRACK. Mom and I stopped in for a quick lunch on my February trip to Arizona. We were in between errands for my Grandmother and needed a place to gather our bearings and have something to eat. We split a sandwich with chicken, avocado, lettuce, tomato and mustard on a dark rye (something Panera doesn't have) and it was tasty. The folks working there were very helpful and it gave my Mom and I a much needed place to plan, divide and conquer.   With Wildflower Bread Company now open across and just up the street, I doubt I will be coming here but it did exceed my expectations."}
{"text":"Foods decent and the service is fast. Totally worth going if ur looking for something healthy and fresh :)"}
{"text":"This Paradise location is one of the noisiest locations I have ever been to. Keep that in mind if you are planning a lunch business meeting. Otherwise the service is great!"}
{"text":"I love Paradise Bakery.  I may have frequented every location in the valley, (some more than others), for business meetings. Only one bad experience back in 2012 so I am updating my review because I have been happy ever since!"}
{"text":"The quality is really going down hill here.  The employees are rude and unconcerned with customer service.  The ability to say please and thank you is gone.  I was getting  served a salad with a large  gadh cracked out of it.  When i went to pay only one cashier who said she will help you on that side in a second.  No i am sorry or we will be right with you.  Flavored iced teas were watered down and pasta was served over cooked and burnt.  I used tobe a fan but the quality of food and staff has taken a turn for the worst.  You know when u have more dressing on the outside of your bowl than inside these people really fo not give a crap"}
{"text":"Great food! I love there broccoli cheddar soup in a bread bowl! There customer service is pretty good but could use a little work! Overall good place"}
{"text":"Good for airport food. The turkey sausage was surprisingly good. Sercice was very quick and the price was low for an airport. Next time I roll through phoenix I'll be stopping by again for breakfast."}
{"text":"This place is my weak spot.  I work closeby and sneak over there for lunch every once in awhile.  Everyone is always so friendly there. The employees are very professional and sweet.  The food is amazing!! I especially love the Fuji apple chicken salad and the Grilled Cheese sandwich yum!    The best part is their cookies though. All their cookies are moist and not too over cooked."}
{"text":"Definitely the best sandwich I've ever had in an airport! Had the veg sandwich and it was great, fresh with friendly fast service. Tasty cookies, too."}
{"text":"Nice and clean. We were greeted at the door with cookies. staff is still learning, please be patient with them. :) Out of small bowls do we were upgraded to large salads!! Point system is down, save your receipt."}
{"text":"Line was long and checkout tools bit longer than expected but the food was delicious. For being part of the Panera family, it was an enjoyable breakfast spot before my flight.  Price was fine and the food was delivered rather promptly. Just speeding up the checkout process would make this place much better but the long lines probably have to do with its location right at the end of the TSA line. Good place."}
{"text":"I guess a lot of people go there for B/L/D?  We've tried it for breakfast (muffins with very low degree of filling flavor) and lunch (sandwiches).  I argued 2-3 stars with myself.  Two because I think their ordering system sucks.  Three because their food can often be good (not all the time, but often).  I'll keep looking for something tastier.  But Paradise is not bad."}
{"text":"I wanted to update my review based on my last experience.  As usual, I ordered a half salad and decided to get the southwestern Caesar. I asked for onions and the nice guy behind the counter happily put them on top of my salad. The salad for a half size looked awesome. I also decided to try their baked potato soup and some sugar cookies for the fun of it.  All I have to say is everything was great! Salad was filling, soup was soo good I didn't want to stop eating it but had to because I was full. And the sugar cookie was one of the best I have had. I also was able to get a fork and noticed they were not lacking available utensils like the last few times.   I left a very happy camper."}
{"text":"This is one of their worst units. There always seems to be a problem. Today stale bagel and blue berry muffin. I don't get it I thought they bake it fresh its a bakery."}
{"text":"Opposite experience of the below - excellent service, salad was lackluster. Sugar cookie was exactly what I was hoping for - so I would say stick to the baked goods when ordering food from a bakery kind of restaurant! Lots of options up on the menu boards, but difficult to see them all until you right up by the cashier."}
{"text":"Buried in my unfinished reviews is this one.  I owe Paradise Bakery an apology as I love this particular location.  Lots of seating and always clean.  I actually prefer Paradise for dinner, rather than lunch.  No parking dilemmas, and the place is nice and quiet.  Before this one opened, the nearest location to me was Fashion Square.  What a debacle that one is!  My long-time favorite is their chicken salad on molasses bread.  I could eat this every day of my life.  I have ventured away from it at times, but have always left wishing I had gone with the chicken salad.  But wait, there's a new kid in town...the Big Kid Grilled Cheese with gruyere, white cheddar, and American for the all-important meltiness (yes, it's a word).   And BACON!!!!!!  What bacon can do for a sandwich is mind-boggling.  With their creamy tomato soup, it's a match made in my version of heaven."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and treated my Real Estate Agent and was with Family. She had suggested this place and was her first time dining here for lunch. We enjoyed for the most part our lunch. Yet, it is pricey. I had 1/2 of my meal left and politely asked one of the front counter female employees if I could have a small box to take my sandwich to go. She replied and said we don't have boxes, we have paper. She provided me a couple of sheets and I was in thought how am I sealing the wrapper on this? No binding, tape, sticker, etc. Funny thing my Agent says what's up with the paper? Why didn't you get a box. I said I was told they don't have boxes. She says look at the table behind you and tell me what you see. Behold!!!! There was food inside a clear box. My Agent walks up to the same female employee at the counter and asks for a box and was given one. My Agent says, now why didn't you give one to the young lady I am with? She answers, we don't give boxes.  Anyway, sounds very silly. Yet, let me point out there was (4) of us for LUNCH and our tab was over $40. What's the tightness about providing the proper container? Seriously, the female employee was NOT paying for it. Not only that when she spoke with me she had utter rudeness and demeanor in her body language. She wasn't busy and I asked when she was finished for a small moment with customers to ask for a container.   I wouldn't mind returning to Paradise. But I hope friendly customer service is implemented for my next visit. I would be willing to change my rating if there are MINOR improvements.  PASS: French onion soup. They add the dried croutons in it and the cheese is slivers of cheese that's in their cooler bin. NOT your traditional french onion soup. Parking is a challenge during lunch time. So please be patient."}
{"text":"Wow if I could give this place a big fat 0 I would. HORRIBLE. They were out of some of the bread for their sandwiches. Imagine a bakery that is out of bread. We also ordered their featured seasonal soup. Guess what? They were out of it.  Food not worth the price. Don't go."}
{"text":"I've been to so many PB's I could write 15 different reviews but I won't since this one along with the Scottsdale Fashion Square mall food court one are the ones I frequent the most.    I think the idea behind this restaurant is very good . . . feature fresh ingredients in a pleasant surrounding.  Their fresh baked cookies are not only delectable but dangerous if you have a cookie jones like I do.  I could eat a dozen sugar, snickerdoodle and chocolate chip cookies in a heartbeat.  My favorite sandwich which others have mentioned is the walnut chicken on molasses bread.  Paired with either a small Cesar salad or a cup of soup, and you're good to go.  Always dependable, reliable, friendly and consistent pretty much from location to location, this is my go to fast food joint when I am around urban areas.  I only wish they would open one up in Flagstaff or Prescott.  Great food.  Reasonable prices.  Very good quality.  You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Pretty standard Paradise Bakery in a good enough location. As always the baked goods are scrumptious, which is to be expected from PB. The down side of our last visit was the broken toilet in the ladies restroom. This reduced down the number of stalls to one. Given the amount of people who use the establishment one is not enough. Thus making for a rather disappointing state of affairs, especially when a soccer team full of people (literally a soccer team, sadly, not an exaggeration) arrive and you've just finished your morning caffeinated beverage of choice. This visit was in December -- so I'm sure this issue has been fixed by now."}
{"text":"A solid go-to option for hungry shoppers and the surrounding corporate types who want a quick lunch rather than a sit-down experience.  I have to relay my great experience with one of their employees, Michael.    I ordered the tomato mozzarella (a fantastic veggie option!!!), and somehow I walked out of the store with a box of cookies instead of a sandwich.  I called into the store and explained what happened.  Michael personally offered to bring me a new sandwich to my workplace across the street after he got off his shift.  To go out of his way for me off the clock was a whole new level of customer service that prompted me to write this review.  I ended up not needing to take Mr. Michael up on his offer - my partner took us out to lunch.  So I called back in to tell him so he wouldn't go through all that effort, and Sir Michael the Lovely told me my next visit would be a free lunch.  And the choc chip cookies were wonderful too!!! Love love love."}
{"text":"Took my Mom here for Mother's Day because she loves this place.  I was happy to see that nobody else was in there so I could take my time ordering, that was not the case at all.  My brother ordered first and was trying to tell the girl how he wanted his salad, meanwhile the cashier was calling to him to pay for his meal.  Next thing you know she's calling down to me so she can ring me up on his order and I haven't even decided what I wanted yet.  When I finally decided she rang us up and come to find out they ran out of what I ordered so she had to refund him (which was a difficult task for her to figure out and took over 10 min) and charge the new price.  They ended up making my brothers salad wrong and my sandwich wrong.  Thumbs down to this experience.  I will not be returning."}
{"text":"BLT with turkey & avocado was tasty but fell apart in my hands. Pricey even with military discount. Free cookie that comes with the sandwich was bomb though"}
{"text":"When you want to grab a quick lunch, but hate fast food, Paradise Bakery Cafe is always a safe bet.  This location is busy at lunch time, but the staff is friendly and well prepared to take your order and serve your lunch in 5 minutes or less.  The cafe is clean and inviting and has a well stocked beverage station.  ( I hate when there are no fresh lemon slices for my ice tea. This location always comes thru!)  My \" You Pick 2\" lunch consisted of a generous 1/2 Fuji Apple chicken salad and a 1/2 Mediterranean Veggie sandwich.  Both were tasty and did not disappoint.  Don't expect gourmet or exotic fare. Just standard soups/salads/sandwiches and treats ..... But always consistently fresh and flavorful."}
{"text":"I ordered the half sandwich and soup combo....so far so good.  She took what I thought was a half-sandwich and cut that in half!!!!   Oh boy, very small.  I attached a picturet.   Anyways, the soup was broccoli and cheese. That was pretty good.  Total was 8 bucks.  I'm not going back, I dont see what the hype is at this place besides it being at the airport."}
{"text":"I met my college roommate here for lunch one day.  It's been a while since I was at a Paradise Bakery (if ever possibly) and they hit one of my pet peeves.  There are different stations where you order sandwiches and salads and it's a cafeteria line style.   My pet peeve comes in with the areas not being clearly marked and the workers presuming you've been there a million times and not telling you to order from the next person without looking at you like you're crazy.  UGH.  I hate feeling like an idiot just because I've never been in a place before and don't know your ordering process.  Ok, end rant.  I got a Paradise Club.  The meat tasted a bit processed, but the croissant was delicious!  The Dijon vinaigrette was also quite tasty!  The food was brought out fairly quickly to the table and they didn't seem to mind us lingering for quite some time while chatting and catching up.    It was ok and I'd definitely stop in here again, but wouldn't be a priority place for lunch for me if I was in Scottsdale.    On a side note, there were people using the free WiFi and Skyping in the place.  Who skypes in public like that?  I really wanted to jump in and say hi to whoever was chatting, but thought the folks may get upset."}
{"text":"I'm happy to welcome another Paradise Bakery to the Scottsdale neighborhood. At first I wondered why they would open a P.B. so close to their other one at the mall, but in thinking about it a little more, I realize that these two locations must get two totally different groups of visitors.   This P.B. is airy, open, quick and of course has the delicious Paradise Bakery quality of food. I won't go into depth about the food here since this is a pretty prominent chain, but their sandwiches, salads, soup and breakfast are always delicious (especially their Walnut Chicken Salad Sandwich and Tomato soup!) I like that this location has plenty of parking, enough space to hang out and do some work and fast service.   Now I will say that with this being in Old Town, there are many other restaurants I would visit before coming to this Paradise Bakery. However, if you need food on the go and you're passing by this bakery, you will be happy with your experience."}
{"text":"When I'm stuck at the airport and hungry before a flight, this is where I go. This Paradise Bakery is equipped with all the same items and elements as their other locations but it is typically quick and convenient for those on the go at the airport.   My go-to items a the airport Paradise Bakery are the breakfast sandwiches, muffins (great for the hotel room) and sandwiches. There's nothing more I can really say about this Bakery but it's definitely worth visiting if you're at the airport and hungry. Don't forget to take banana chocolate chip muffin for the flight!"}
{"text":"This Paradise Bakery is spacious and offers plenty of indoor seating to accommodate the rush hour. I did notice though that they limited my internet usage to a half hour but I hope that's only during the rush hour. Food wise, my favorite sandwiches are the BLT, the chicken walnut sandwich, the club and the tuna. When it's cold, I love their creamy tomato soup and you can't leave without ordering a cookie or three! The fresh cookies are straight from the oven and melt in your mouth. I often come here for breakfast and order my favorite muffin, the banana chocolate chip or a yogurt parfait. In summary, you can't go run with breakfast or lunch and the seating is plentiful. Just be warned that it might be hard to find parking!"}
{"text":"The staff is always super nice, friendly, and helpful, and I love the food. The sandwiches can be a little overprice for what you're actually getting but I love the paradise bread, so it works out:) and I LOVE the autumn squash soup! And I don't know how the cookies are always perfectly soft....but they're so good!"}
{"text":"This is a Panera with a different name. When Panera buys them out, I hope they don't eliminate the salad bar, as that was the best part."}
{"text":"Similar to panera, I think panera bought them?? My favorite here is the chicken salad sandwich on honey wheat bread and they have the best chocolate chip cookies!!!!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here around 5am to get a oatmeal before my flight. I ordered it with all the toppings, it was very sad, dry and they have it to me completely bare. The employees didn't seem to happy to be there at all. Hopefully it was a off day and just early. Next time I will go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I am happy to say this review is a \"pay it forward\" type of review! I went to this Paradise for my lunch break. I had been craving their fontina grilled cheese and creamy tomato soup for over a week prior.  There were many people and it was slightly getting disorganized (I waited behind people who were getting salads and was not told it was ok to go around them for over 5 mins).  I get to the soup station and I was told that they no longer have the creamy tomato soup. I was a bit bummed and just said \" oh, that was what I was really looking forward to\".   The manager heard my remark and said \" We are just so sorry we don't have that soup now, but how about we buy your lunch for your trouble\". I couldn't believe it! She was so kind and even gave me a large drink. I have never had such wonderful customer service. That really made my day. I can't wait to go back and give them my business for years to come. I did not catch the manager's name but she was awesome and had a big smile on her face the whole time! My faith in humanity is restored because of this place."}
{"text":"A behind security airport restaurant so it doesn't get much of a review. The asiago egg and bacon sandwich was tasty. Reasonably priced at $14 for two and two bottled waters.  Watching the counter while we ate and they did seem a bit disorganized."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are pretty yummy. Personal favorites include the croissant bacon turkey deliciousness and Italian. The turkey cranberry and pasta salads are definitely on the bad side. I ordered from here to provide thank you lunches for the patients and assistant I used for boards. I don't know if it was because I was incredibly gorgeous or they saw me drooling over the baked goods, but they put three free cookies to go with my sandwiches which I thought was very kind and almost made up for the high cost. Liked that it was open at 6 AM."}
{"text":"Meh. Overpriced and wait was too long.  Got a free cookie which was nice. But you know what really made me happy? The amount of avocado they added. Boom!"}
{"text":"I ordered a catering order on Friday for Monday pick up. It was messed up, I called and spoke with a manager, who was going to look into it.   Veronica the catering manager called me back. (Someone else took the original order-a man not her) The reason I will give Paradise Bakery 5 stars on this day still, is HER CUSTOMER SERVICE IS AMAZING. She ended up coming to our office bringing us cookies and 10% off catering order and free sandwich coupons. She went ABOVE AND BEYOND. I couldn't believe she actually drove to my office to sincerely apologize on the order. I actually was just at paradise bakery ordering for myself 20  mins before this. I double check my order from now on, because of errors and she said ask for her from now on and I can just order thru her. I told her that isnt necessary since she has all the catering orders, but I appreciate her sincere offer. She makes me want to continue to be a loyal customer. Again I love Paradise Bakery. I just hated the mess ups. I will continue to eat there and order our catering thru them.  Thank you Veronica. You should be praised for your great customer service."}
{"text":"Fresh tasty sandwiches, excellent cookies. Fast somewhat self service, busybusy even at 2pm during the week."}
{"text":"Pretty good stuff for fast food. Better than most"}
{"text":"Ordered the grilled cheese with tomato. First grilled cheese I've ever had that was two pieces of dry bread with Cheese that felt like it was fake. No butter on outside of slices of bread to give it flavor.  Absolutely flavorless. Never again. Thank goodness for the cookie."}
{"text":"Great healthy options fast plus loys of delicious fresh baked goods. I've loved everything I've tried here especially the chicken walnut salad with raspberry dressing, so yummy. If you are getting a salad skip ahead of the line to the salad bar instead of waiting behind the sandwich orders. The location is great for meeting people outside of security as there's plenty of seating and it's right in the middle of both security exits."}
{"text":"Well it's about the only place open at PHX Skyharbor at 4am. Had a lemon poppyseed. I really really don't think even the lowest standards could unabashedly say that this muffin had poppyseeds. They were so few that the muffin should be called \"Artificially Flavoured Lemonish muffin with a few Poppyseeds added.\""}
{"text":"Quick services, a decent selection, and solid customer service."}
{"text":"My food and drink were fine even though order was never successfully processed. I told the man at the register several times I had a dairy allergy, but of course my breakfast came out with melted cheese all over it. When it came out the second time it had no cheese but was the wrong order...I just ate it cause at this point I wanted to get outta there. Meh."}
{"text":"I love Paradise Bakaery's Spinich Power salad, except I make a few modifications to it to suit my liking.  I never get bacon, i add red onions and diced tomatos and always get the balsamic vinegarette dressing.  For the past 3 times that I have gone to this PB location they have not gotten my order right.  I usually check my order before I leave but today I was careless and was disappointed to get back to my office to have my salad not made how I ordered it.  It was apparent that the salad was made traditional style with no regard to how I ordered it.  I will not be going back to this location since they do not pay attetnion to their customers orders.  Having the wrong lunch defintiely puts a damper on the remainder of my workday.  I will continue to go to other PB locations that you watch as your salad is prepared and pay last!!!  I also love the paradise pasta salad but I do not know what was up with it today.  It actually tasted bad - like something in it was not all too fresh! I got a large order had about two bites and it was just so terrible tasting!  I had the worst experience at PB today which really upsets me since is one of my favorite lunch spots."}
{"text":"I had a layover in Phoenix on Friday, September 21st so I decided to get some food from Paradise in order to take on my next flight. I ordered 1/2 of the southwest ceasar salad and 1/2 turkey sandwich on wheat in addition to a lemon poppysead muffin. I ate the muffin and salad with no incident. On the plane (after takeoff), I unwrapped my sandwich  and wedged inside the bottom portion of the bread and otherwise not visible unless the entire sandwich was unwrapped was a huge STAPLE. I couldn't believe that there was a staple inside my sandwich. If I had not unwrapped the sandwich and examined it (to determine if there was mayo on it) I could have been seriously injured by ingesting this at 30,000 feet. Take a close look before eating anything from here."}
{"text":"Never again!! This is the second time, so we're two for two, that I've tried Paradise Bakery, ordering something *very* simple both times, and both times came away disgusted enough to not eat the food. First round, I ordered a toasted bagel with low-fat cream cheese and tomato. The tomato was an upcharge, fine, but the bagel literally had one tiny slice of tomato per side. The tomato was green and tough. The bagel was cold and hard as a rock. Why? Because not only had they failed to toast it, but it was also an old, stale bagel. Gross!!   I decided to give Paradise a second shot. I wanted a grilled cheese but with white cheddar and on a croissant. This too proved entirely too difficult for Paradise Bakery staff, who loaded up the croissant with far too much cheese, but failed to melt it. The result? A cold croissant with a tower of crumbly, cold hard cheese. Correct me if I'm wrong: isn't the whole point of grilled cheese to grill said cheese??? Do you think, despite my ravenous hunger, that I could even choke this down? No, I couldn't, and that makes strike two for Paradise Bakery---I will make it a point to never go back."}
{"text":"Four solid stars for being a great option among the plethora of really, really bad airport food in this country. I had half a mozzarella sandwich and half a berry summer salad. My wife had the same salad and a quiche.  The quiche was large and tasty. The salads were good as well even if they had some canned fruit in there. At least the strawberries and blueberries were fresh (then again, have you ever seen canned strawberries?).  I wish they would have places like this in every airport instead of all the greasy fast food or expensive and tasteless salads that usually are your only options."}
{"text":"I tried not to eat at airports because they are always super over-priced. At the other terminal, I saw a salad for FIFTEEN flippin dollars! I am glad I didn't buy it over there!  I got the full size chicken cob salad with avocado for 9.30 (including tax). It's still a bit more expensive than non-airport grab-and-go places, but at least it's not $15.  When I first walked past paradise bakery & cafe, there was a line. I decided to go wait at the gate first. About half and hour or so after I came back and there was no line. I placed my order and got my salad in about 5 minutes.  The salad is not prepackaged, they actually assemble the salad after you've ordered. The full size portion is a decent size. I saw the guy making my salad using 1/2 of an avocado for the salad! Nom! Not just some tiny slices! The grilled chicken were precooked (not cook onsite) and came in a package. I was not a big fan of how the chicken tasted. it was just alright. All the ingredients tasted fresh. No wilted lettuce! The salad also came with plenty of tomato and bacon pieces.   Overall it was a good experience."}
{"text":"Mediocre food (they have \"airportized\" their normal menu - so price is up and quality is down) but my main beef here is the customer service, or lack there of.   If you want organic quinoa, an egg white Mediterranean salad sandwich and a side order of incompetence and bitchy attitude, then this is the spot for you. It's like everyone here is sour on their job.   The only employee that wasn't rude or crabby was a guy pounding out muffins and scowling at customers though his little glass window."}
{"text":"Dash, fresh, and just-like home cooked + a free chocolate chip cookie with each meal!"}
{"text":"Found a piece of PAPER in Avocado Egg White Sandwich and a hair in the Mac and cheese. The sandwich was cold and the \"chippers\" (mini cookies) were hard. Also extremely overpriced, but you can expect this from any Panera/Paradise."}
{"text":"Paradise Bakery is usually a good place to go for a quick bit to eat if you're looking for a sandwich, soup or salad and there's not a Wildflower or Jason's deli near by. Their food is fresh and they have fantastic bakery items.   Their service is not consistent in this location so you may have a wonderful experience or a disappointment.  They are not accommodating when it comes to customer request that differ from their menu options.   Southwest chicken Caesar and their crumbly blue cheese with chicken added are good salad options.  Not a fan of their chicken neither noodle nor beef barley soups. Stick with their fire roasted garlic tomato soup if you want something warm to eat. Their sandwiches are ok, not deli quality but ok. I would stick with something made with either turkey or chicken, for their hams and beefs are lacking.  Their cookies, cakes and muffins are what keeps me coming back. They offer seasonal selections with their bakery items so try something new when you go.    In a pinch for something fresh and quick to eat, this is a good Paradise Bakery to go to."}
{"text":"Whenever I go out to lunch with my sister and my two small nephews, this is where we end up. Matt (five years old) LOVES the kids turkey sandwich. Pretty funny. He devours the thing, slurps down the gogurt and loves the huge chocolate chip cookie that comes with it.   Chris (three) loves the Mac n cheese, and ya know what? It's actually pretty good. Aunt Andrea usually ends up finishing it for him... Not complaining there.  I usually get a different sandwich each time, but I always get the Greek salad and it's great every time. Very fresh ingredients.   The only thing I don't like about this type of store is how confusing it is. Especially when people are in line behind you, there's so much pressure! There are too many options and it's hard to take it all in. But when I do finally pick something (usually at random just to be done with it), it's always enjoyable."}
{"text":"It's true about the service.  It could be better.  If they just turned it up a notch, it would make a huge difference.  The manager guy (at least he seems like the manager as he's dressed in a button up and not an apron) taking orders does not come off as friendly.  He's not outright rude, but he could at least pretend that he doesn't mind being there.  His unsmiling face as he takes your order (and seemingly rushes you to move on) sets the tone for a lackluster trip down the food line toward the harried cashiers.  More often than not, food seems overpriced though generally tasty.  Also worth mentioning:  while we ate at a table off to the side of the bakery section, we were within earshot of two youngish employees.  They openly complained to each other about how little the customers' tips were that day.  They are certainly within their right to commiserate, but it might be a better idea to save it for break time when not around customers.  Frankly, I only return here because my husband sometimes craves a certain sandwich on the menu.  This place could be so much more enjoyable if they just cared and tried a little harder with service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Located in Terminal 4 - it's a safe spot for a quick, warm meal! I ordered a tomato mozzarella panini that came out promptly. The cheese was hot and melted in with the tomato sauce and fresh tomato slices. The ciabatta bread was crisp and buttery! The best part of the meal was the free cookie I found hidden in my to go bag!!!"}
{"text":"Place was way too crammed in my opinion... Had a hard time getting in line while chairs and tables crowd the entrance. Got a wildberry smoothie and it was too watery. Even told the girl to add a lot of ice and she walked away saying yes with an attitude. Cinnamon roll was good. Overall it was average. Nothing too great nothing too bad."}
{"text":"Seriously Paradise...this thing half chicken panini) costs $5 and was 3 bites...not even that good. What a rip! Last time I eat here (and I love Panera in ATL)"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could.  You may be aware that I have a health scale that I use to rate eateries.  For me its all about how healthy it is. Coming in at 5 stars would be an almost 100% raw vegan restaurant. 4 starts would be any place with actual fresh food.  Therefore, paradise bakery is a 4.5.         Now for something not so healthy...insanely good, homemade quality cookies."}
{"text":"I came here to grab a quick coffee and snack.   The coffee is a little watery and run down wouldn't suggest it.   But the cookies, bread, and muffins are super yummy!   I might have eaten the entire dozen of cookies I bought for the crew but nope I was good!"}
{"text":"Paradise is ok if you're in the mood for a very average sandwich. The only thing they have going for them are their chocolate chip cookies, and don't fall for the buy one get one free offer at the register. You get a free cookie with your meal anyway."}
{"text":"If you eat lunch out in the Metro Phoenix area, chance are you've had PB, and know the food definitely good.  That being said, this one gets a lower rating for service. I used to order lunch from here on a daily basis for my office (take out). My boss is obsessed with soup and sanwiches for lunch, and we are up the street, so this was the obvious place. I swear they messed up my order almost every single time. Everytime it was a wrong item, wrong modifier, wrong amount of cookies, forgot an item altogether,etc. I can memorized about ten orders in my head and check them for accuracy when I get there. I just dont understand why they cannnot do the same given they are in the lunch biz, enter the order in thier computer, and read it back to me mulitple times!  We finally moved on to other soup/sandwich locations in the area, and most of them have much better accuarcy. :)  They have some menu items at this location that are different than others, and they are good so that is a plus. Also, if you are at any PB location, pick up a box of black and white chippers! They are fab."}
{"text":"Love that this is a Panera bread so that I can continuously earn points towards free coffees, pastries, and meals.  Tons of space here, great service, and a welcoming environment.  Pay attention to the deals they offer. I had a whole month where they were giving a free bagel every day. I bought a tub of the cream cheese which is so creamy and smooth. And of course, the coffee is really high quality. I always go for the hazelnut."}
{"text":"Stopped by this new location and had lunch.  It is a great spot for a quick meal - always good, fresh ingredients.  I enjoyed the service as well.  Will return to this convenient location again."}
{"text":"Lots of menu items that aren't available at other PBs.  Everything tastes good.  Wish they had a green iced tea option."}
{"text":"I think Paradise Bakery was far better.  My husband and I took our two young daughters (a 3 year old and 13 month old).  Total came to almost $45.00.  We could have gone to a nice sit down restaurant for this price.    Food didn't taste fresh and the Greek Cobb salad wasn't even edible, the steak sandwich had less than two small pieces of meat.  For the cost, taste, and food quality, my husband and I would not come back.  Sorely disappointing as we really wanted to like this place.  They need to lower their prices, revise their menu and focus on fresh."}
{"text":"I came in with my two sons for dinner tonight and were very pleased with the food and service.  Emily went above and beyond when I had a specific challenge with my order.  My boys ate everything.  We left very happy. I would highly recommend this location."}
{"text":"Most of the time I am at Paradise when I am leaving on a flight and I want my free cookie for parking at Blue Sky.  Love their baked goods but I have also had their breakfast and lunch too.  It is always delicious, their baked goods are fresh and flavorful.  Cookies were soft and chewy."}
{"text":"This restaurant is inside the mall. Not much can they so low the stand alone cafes. The down side is they do not have drinks refills anymore. However chick-fil-a next door does. So I get my chicken walnut sandwich and then get my drink next door. Problem solved  Sometimes the portions can be smaller but then you simply ask for a bit more and they usually accommodate you.   Please be aware that this cafe has younger employees and they are not as willing to bend the rules or they do not have the authority to do so.  A chocolate chip cookie comes with each meal and you can substitute for another type of cookie such as peanut butter or oatmeal. I find the oatmeal raisin to be one of the best ones around"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful place to eat if you are ever in Phoenix.  I have only visited the one in the airport, but it is simply delicious!  The ordering is a little confusing at first, but the staff is gracious & happy to help.  It is very much worth the effort to go!  Sandwiches are beyond fresh as well as everything else on the menu!"}
{"text":"If you are in a hurry or not, this place serves great food at reasonable prices. I especially like the Paradise Bakery Club Croissant and a big cookie to boot."}
{"text":"Although far from where I live, this is my favorite Paradise Bakery location to go to! Everything is to a T, anyway, I've never had any problems here -but I've had some bad experiences at the location on 7th street and Bell! The staff always exceeds expectations at this location too!"}
{"text":"Food the usual of Paradise. They were out of soup, forgot to make my smoothie.  4 people there, only 2 helping customers during lunch and if they moved any slower they would be stopped. Not many choices in Terminal 2 so I guess they figure you're stuck with them. Next time I'll have my meal on the plane."}
{"text":"So awful. Ordered a steak and blue cheese salad. The cashier repeated back, \"Asian salad.\" Also ordered pick 2 for my dining partner. While my dining partner said the food was adequate, the \"steak\" in my salad was inedible. It was just chunks of fat and gristle. So, so gross."}
{"text":"Our lovely neighborhood coffee shop Always nice to come over.  The best service , good atmosphere.  Clean. And affordable , defiantly recommend for meeting or for a worm tomato soup."}
{"text":"A lot like panera bread very good food and a tad over priced. But if you are in a pinch and want a solid meal this is your place:-)"}
{"text":"Service is lackluster. No one smiles or greets you. It's like walking into a sleep study, everyone is sleep walking. Order came out wrong and was corrected, but food quality has gone down here. I did not enjoy my breakfast sandwich. Coffee is cold and even after mentioning it to someone, it was still cold after they changed it out. I will not come back here. There are better places I can spend my money."}
{"text":"These guys rocked. Called them last minute and asked if they could possibly do a last minute custom cookie. They popped it out in like 5 minutes and it was delicious. I also eat their turkey chili like twice a week (which is also seriously healthy). I am really into customer service and I always get the friendliest people when I go here. Went to this location and the one at ASU. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I love paradise but this one took me for surprise. My sandwhices where very sloppy. But the turkey chili. Awsome!! Managment was yelling at the sandwhich maker... Poor kid. Lol. Overall not happy with the food or the service. The one at az mills 5 stars. Always get what you ask for. Happy eats!!"}
{"text":"I've been to several other Paradise Bakery & Cafe's, and had a decent experience despite the ridiculous ordering system.   However, last night I was absolutely disgusted by the service and product. When my girlfriend and I arrived the ordering line was small, but still chaos because no one was directing people where to go. There was two very nice senior citizens in line in front of us that were clearly confused by the ordering system. Rather than politely assisting these two women, the employees working the ordering line (both of them) were abrupt and rude to them. The employees barked orders and scoffed, and were clearly annoyed by their lack of understanding for the ridiculous ordering system. These two women finally placed their orders and made it through the checkout like without much help or assistance from the people that should have been helping them the entire time.   My girlfriend and I placed and received our order, except for half of an ultimately mediocre sandwich. I waited another 10 minutes for a half of a sandwich which was sitting on the counter prepared the entire time.   The food was mediocre at best, and I will never return to this, or any other Paradise Bakery, because of the absolutely terrible attitudes of the staff and poor treatment of their customers."}
{"text":"I came back here after having been gone for over 5 years. Not sure what happened or if I had better memories of this place than what it really was but...the cookies all tasted like shortening and sugar.  I was so disgusted by the sugar cookie I bought I ate half of it and threw the rest out. Hubby's ginger molasses was pure sugar and didn't taste like like ginger or molasses...just sugar with some flour in it.  The chocolate chip cookie also was so sickeningly sweet.   Not sure what happened with their cookies, but they went so far sweet they're inedible.  I won't even start on the turkey sandwich I ordered. It was terrible as well. Maybe I got to the place on a bad day, but when I come back to AZ again, I will make sure to skip Paradise Bakery...it was not a paradise kind of hit for me."}
{"text":"I do not remember why, but i always thought I hated paradise bakery. I think I had a crappy sandwich once before. Well I was craving a salad with fruit and cheese while across the street at platos closet, so I stopped in for a fiji apple salad (1/2 dressing)  to go. I spoted the mini carrot cakes and needed one desperately. I received very nice customer service, a little shock at the price, but once I ate and drank my yummy mango tea I was on cloud nine!!!!!  The salad was perfect, 1/2 dressing is the way to go for me, fruits cheesy nutty heaven. The carrot cake was a food climax (haha, had to) in my mouth. I love paradise now, gonna be back much more often. Oh I also had a zucchini muffin a different time and it was amazing as well!"}
{"text":"This location is not as impressive as arrowhead.  I was helped by a very nice girl, who had my name :) it wasn't busy so she helped me sort through the nutrition binder (which was a disaster, not her fault). I went with her advice and tried the spinach power salad for the first time, and I didn't like it at all.  The person who made the salad did a poor job, all the toppings were on the bottom.  A weird thing to complain about, but there were too many, they dumped them on by the cup full, so my salad was like a fried onion bacon soup swimming in dressing, and the dressing wasn't good.  The hubby had a sandwich, turkey blt... It was good, bland but good.  I don't like the free cookie either... HAHA what a thing to complain about! It isn't a good cookie though, so it went into the trash.  The iced coffee was as weak as coffee can be, and the half and half was out past it's time.  Other than Courtney being super nice a helpful, I was very disappointed."}
{"text":"My favorite lunch spot because it's close to work! I live off there greek salad its amaze! Kizzy is the girl that rang me up today and had exceptional customer service! She made my day! The other girl at the register not so much.. Im not sure if I became invisible or not but I was next and she just went and picked up the phone without acknowledging what she was about to do! It was akward and poor customer service! Not what I have ever gotten at PB! Thats why I am giving 3 stars! Kizzy and my lunch get 5 though!"}
{"text":"I am dairy free, I got treated like a criminal. The manager & employees didn't know anything about their products.   They made me read the list of ingredients to check for dairy, then expected me to go to the back of the line to get my dressing & were rude. I had had to get pushy to get my salad & dressing."}
{"text":"priced the way i might expect outside an airport (sizeable hot tasty panini was about $8) plus free cookie! friendly service and fast"}
{"text":"Wifi has been much better.  It is still very busy during the lunch hour, so I plan my lunches a little later (after 1pm) so I'll miss the crowds."}
{"text":"Stuck in the airport waiting for my compatriots so I swing by paradise to see what the hoopla is all about.   I try the paradise club, because it has bacon....nuff said. Unfortunately, not even the smokey, salty goodness of bacon could save this joint!  The croissant was discernibly stale, the cold cuts were...cold cuts. Hard to screw that up!  Overall I was underwhelmed by the sandwich and all three points go to the chocolate chip cookie that comes with the meal.  Hooray for free cookies!!!"}
{"text":"Ate alone since I was running errands.  Quick, fast, and good!  I was HUNGRY, almost turning HANGRY!  I got the pick 2 -ham and cheese with mac & cheese plus a cookie and I added a soup, chicken wild rice.  Everything was tasty and I inhaled every bit all of all the food and gulped down my green ice teas (2 large cups).  One minor con, many of the tables were not cleaned so you had find a clean one."}
{"text":"I thought going at 1pm I would avoid the lunch crowd.  WRONG!  This place was packed to the gills!  The line was all the back by the double entry doors.  It does move quickly!  And after I paid, I went to fill up my drink before I found my seat, my food found me.  They have a 2 for deal now:  I got mac & cheese and 1/2 a sandwich.  The mac & cheese was GOOD.  I got the turkey sandwich with swiss & mayo.  OK, this sandwich was GOOD.   Love the cookie that comes with the meal."}
{"text":"I love Paradise Bakery. I'm a little sad that they are changing this location to a Panera Bread. The employees said it's going to be the same but I doubt that. I have eaten at Panera and it is totally different.   The employee who took my order were nice. The employee who handed me my food not so much. The girl had attitude and seemed annoyed that she was working. I always enjoy getting the soup and cold pasta. Do delicious! For being busy during lunch time  the staff was working hard to prepare each meal correctly. They were also quick to clean the tables and pick up the dishes.   Great soup (broccoli cheddar)"}
{"text":"Food is still pretty good, lunch service a little slow.  I got the Fuji Apple chicken, good salad could have used a little more dressing.   I tried the cream of chicken soup for the first time.  It was really tasty.  I think a little of the slowness in service is due to the store conversions.  They are owned by Panera and are being converted one at a time."}
{"text":"I just had a similar experience to Nycolette N. There were 4 employees and the place was nearly empty. One of them was preparing food for a customer and the other 3 were socializing. I walked up to the cash register with a box of cookies and stood there for a couple of minutes watching the 3 teenagers chit chat and look vaguely irritated that someone was at the register. I guess it wasn't their turn to work. I walked out and they just continued to talk - probably relieved that I had gone away. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Always a good experience.  This was my first visit at the Bell Road location. I had an egg, ham, and cheese breakfast sandwich and a cup of coffee.  Clean restaurant, a variety of seating options depending on your mood, and good/great food quality.     I wish they would include silverware with their dishes.  I always have to get back up and track down a fork or spoon."}
{"text":"Great baked goods.  Love the \"pick 2\" - soup & sandwich; pasta and soup; salad & flatbread; for the indecisive (yeah, that's me!), you can have two of the myriad things that look and really are all exceptionally good.    Iced tea & iced coffee in addition to sodas.   Gets really crowded at lunch so come early to avoid long lines!"}
{"text":"Not a big fan of Paradise. Sandwiches are overpriced. Very corporate. Sweet are too sweet and leave a taste of diabetes in your mouth. Salads are boring. Lots of cheap lettuce is a must, but they flake out on the chicken. Coffee is meh. Service is solid."}
{"text":"My review is for the location in Terminal 3. It opened recently and took the place of an Ice Cream spot that I never saw anyone at.  The service here is great and the food is very tasty. They offer a wide variety of choices including sandwiches, breakfast items, pastries and cookies.  It's a great place to pick up something to eat before your flight."}
{"text":"Had a chicken panini... it was ok.  The caesar salad was better.  Nothing special here."}
{"text":"Solid sandwiches.  The soups are amazing.  Especially the broccoli cheddar.  I always order the Big Kid Grilled Cheese.  They don't go light on the bacon which is nice."}
{"text":"I never tasted \"Paradise\" until a recent visit to Arizona. They have some slogan about being known for their cookies. I felt like the gauntlet was thrown, so I took up the challenge.   I decided to get two chocolate chip cookies. The clerk working here was nice and gave me two for the price of one since it was near the end of the day. The cookies didn't look incredible, but looks can be deceiving. In this case, they weren't.  Mr. L and I waited until our Greyhound Bus ride to Tucson to try them. They were too sugary and did not taste good. We weren't interested in finishing them - not worth the calories nor the effort of chewing. Mr. L said Pepperidge Farm Chocolate Chip Cookies were better, not that Pepperidge Farm cookies are the pinnacle of greatness or bad either, but I expected better from a bakery that brags about their cookies.   The cookies were the perfect 2 star complement to sitting by the bathroom on the back of the Greyhound Bus.   Instead of finding paradise in the cookie form, it was more like \"Paradise Lost.\""}
{"text":"I stopped here while I was waiting at the airport for a flight back home.  The customer service wasn't the greatest.  I ordered a bagel with cream cheese -- took some time in order to get bagel, but the bagel was great for a breakfast meal.  I also tried a lemon cookie and it was soft and so good!  I prefer Panera Bread over Paradise."}
{"text":"I come for the salads & cookies. when I'm feeling it of course."}
{"text":"DIGUSTING AVOID at all cost. We went at the deli section and bought Turkey and Chicken slices. The Chicken was expired almost threw up after tasting it at home. They must have had it in that fridge for YEARS..."}
{"text":"Meh. A full cranberry chicken sandwich is $4.83, and a full strawberry salad is $5.49. But there's a half and half option which I believe should've been cheaper if I'm only getting half of each. I looked up at the board after I got my receipt and noticed I got charged full price. Why have a half and half option if you're charging full price? She said choose any salad and any sandwich you want. Oh and also, it's a slice of turkey with a mountain full of cranberry jam."}
{"text":"I was on my way back to the airport and decided to stop by here to pick up something to go.  Holy crap...this place is awesome!  I'm usually not a fan of baked goods, but I can keep eating those Chocolate Chip Banana Muffins!  The muffin was really moist and had the perfect amount of chocolate chips and banana.  I also ordered a quiche muffin and it was quite good as well!  I definitely need Danielle to ship me some of those muffins on a weekly basis...I'm still craving them!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I was shocked to see their prices for around 4.50 for breakfast, especially when most airport places you're looking at least ten or more. I got the avocado, egg white, and spinach and a large latte for under ten bucks. The breakfast sandwich tasted like it was made for you in someone's kitchen, and not an assembly line manufactured out product. Press grilled grain bread, good ingredients and tasted awesome. They also give free ice water unlike some places that only offer the five dollar bottles. Highly recommend for good healthy ingredients, but for around the same price as McDonald's. Awesome."}
{"text":"This place is a disgrace on the original panera or paradise cafe. I know airport food is insipid and service is bad but never knew it was rude too. I was boarding a late flight with only this place open. I went and saw their menu to be pretty similar to panera and she told me they have a partnership with panera. My mom wanted something fruity so she said the strawberry smoothie is good. After discussion that it is from a mix and not fresh strawberries, i still ordered to realize they didnt have enough to make one. Why promise if you cant deliver?  Next i ordered a mac and cheese (i ordered full, she rang me for half). Then later i stoof for 15 min waiting for it. Saw a man come in who's sandwich they had forgotten. I reminded them twice about my mac and cheese. She went to the freezer, got a packages bag, heated it and gave it to me in a small. I was skeptical if it was full but thats ok. On tasting it was sooooper cold. I went back to the cashier and she took it back and blamed me for not having the receipt to process a refund as they didnot have another mac and cheese. I said i ordered full when i came to know they DIDNO HAVE full and gave me half. Again, why promsie if you cant deliver?  The staff is pretty rude and comical. A disgrace on the otherwise ok restaurant."}
{"text":"This is a Panera Bread! Came as quite a surprise ... there was no Panera branding whatsoever!  So between that and Google maps showing this as the location, it took me a while to figure it out.  Great food as usual ... enjoyed my Mediterranean Sandwich and Creamy tomato soup. Service was quick.  But they only seemed to have the breakfast menu; I was looking for more of a brunch option. I'll definitely go back to try the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"This location is inside of Arrowhead mall in the food court & I'm only rating them based on my BREAKFAST visit.   I met a friend there for the previously mentioned breakfast, lol, & found myself in a heaping line. Turns out the mall opens early & there are 'walking clubs' that gather there. After all that walking they all get in line for coffee it seems, lol.   The coffee was just ehhh. Nothing special. No lattes. I was REALLY hoping to get their mandarin muffins, which happen to be a little piece of heaven, but the lady informed me they were all out... I can not begin to describe my disappointment as I sat at a cold jiggly table in the mall food court surrounded by people in jogging suites with a plain cup of coffee & a zucchini muffin (which wasn't bad, but wasn't great).   Ce la vie! Sometimes you get the mandarin muffin & sometimes the walking club eats them all :)"}
{"text":"This location is close to my work and that makes it an easy one to go to for lunch.  They are always quick to get food ready, which is nice if you are in a hurry to get back to work. The staff always seems to be friendly and welcoming as soon as you walk in the door.  Their mac and cheese is addictive - you've been warned! The cookies are buy one, get one free and the chocolate chip is my favorite one to add to a small order of the mac and cheese.  There is a decent amount of parking since this location is in a strip that has other stores.  I would recommend trying to go on off lunch times (early or late) in order to avoid the rush - but that applies everywhere, right?  Overall: A  Yay mac and cheese and cookies!"}
{"text":"Was very disappointed coming to this location expecting Paradise bakery only for it to be a Panera. The menu is not a Paradise menu and all the paper products they provide say Panera on them. If your coming to this location expecting a Paradise it's not :("}
{"text":"I normally cringe at chain restaurants so I initially walk in with negative vibes. However, I had a meeting here so I couldn't be a food snob at the moment.  I ordered the mac and cheese and Chipotle panini. The food was bland and didn't taste fresh at all. The green tea and cookie  wasn't bad though. I guess if you are pressed for time, this wouldn't be such a bad place to go. However, if you are in search for good food, this is definitely not it."}
{"text":"Since I moved to Arizona 3 yrs ago, I've flown in/out of Sky Harbor many times.  When I want to grab a quick bite to eat before I head to the gates, I drop by here.  Their Cookies & Pastries are pretty good and service has improved in the time since my last review.  Return Factor - 75%"}
{"text":"We were on vacation in phoenix, and on the drive home our group was tired, hungry, cranky, and everything else that comes with a weekend of partying.   We were looking for a bakery that was doing breakfast, but could not find anything. We stumbled across this place, and we settled for lunch.   This was complete serendipity. We loved the food and the service was amazing, I think the girl who helped us was Ileen. She was incredible.   We all got different sandwiches, they were all super fresh, and very tasty. The baked potato soup was amazing. And we got 4-5 free cookies as well.  We walked out saying to each other, when we are back in the area, we need to come back here.   This place kills Panera. KILLS IT."}
{"text":"been to this location a few times.. i usually come early for lunch so i don't have to wait in long lines during their rush. i always get the salad/sandwich combo - Cesar salad and paradise club sandwich. if my daughter is with me i get the kids meal with mac & cheese and it pretty yummy for a kids meal. i try to never go here for dinner... every time i got the club sandwich the croissant bread is old and gross. better to eat here for lunch. the Cesar salad is a bit different then i remember, i got it yesterday and the dressing was just over powering with the anchovies taste. the service was quick and staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Stopped in here to get a quick bite while running errands. I probably visit various locations about once a month. It never blows me away. I usually go for convenience.   I have noticed that the food quality and taste has slipped over the years. I had the chicken walnut sandwich. Pretty bland chicken salad and the bread was a little hard as if it's been sitting out all day.   I heard a rumor that Paradise Bakery was sold to Panera and the Paradise Bakery stores will be rebranded. I'm a fan of Panera so hopefully things improve soon!"}
{"text":"Delicious place for a light dinner.  I got the french onion soup and was very satisfying.  Reminds me of a Panera Bread cafe.  Came back the next morning for a quick breakfast.  It would help if they offered some hot sauces to go with my eggs...at least I did not see any hot sauce around."}
{"text":"Carmen at the Terminal 4 Location has a bit of an attitude, took 10 minutes to make my two salads, and absolutely crushed all the apple chips in my figi apple chicken. I do not recommend this location, especially if she is working. Would be a more pleasant experience too if they had the same menu as other locations"}
{"text":"Disorganized and inefficient.  Waited 20 minutes for a sandwich, name called, confirmed my order, and I drive 10 miles home.  Wrong sandwich.  Call them up, and told I can come back and pick up the right one!  I guess that if you spend your money at this location, be sure to unwrap and physically inspect the sandwich before leaving property."}
{"text":"This has to be the worst Paradise Bakery on the planet. TERRIBLE, INCOMPETENT staff. Food was horrible. I normally go out of my way for Paradise. Avoid this location at the airport. They screwed up my order and refused to change it because they already swiped my card... The croissant sandwich (most expensive) tasted like a 3 year old made it. Keep walking folks. You have been warned."}
{"text":"Food was good customer service was terrible. I had the Fuji chicken salad with Apple. It was the same salad you can get at Panera which totally hit the spot. The cashier was less than helpful, mostly rude & clearly didn't want to be there."}
{"text":"Good food. Very SLOW service. Seems like the bottleneck is the register. Employees are slow and seem to have no urgency at all. There was 7 people in front of me and it took 26 minted to get to the register. I'll try again since the food is good."}
{"text":"At 5:15am they already did not have items on the menu.  Guess pecans cost them too much.   No yogurt either"}
{"text":"Bad management!!!! The problems with this location all reflect the manager. Unorganized, slow and sloppy"}
{"text":"Although it has not opened yet I am glad it's close to where I love they have the best salads for a good price"}
{"text":"Panera Bread wannabes. Food was OK and coffee was Eh. Not large portions for price. Free chocolate chip cookie was a nice touch and the orange scone was good. Broccoli cheddar soup was pretty good. Would not come back."}
{"text":"I hated food in terminal 3...that is, until I gave Paradise a shot.   The staff were incredibly friendly; the sandwich maker even created my California turkey exactly as I requested: pesto mayo and ranch on the side, with extra veggies.  The bread was incredibly fresh and the veggies were crisp. The turkey was so-so...nothing special. The pesto mayo made the sandwich. Plus, it came with a freshly baked chocolate chip cookie.   A great place for a quick, healthy bite before a flight."}
{"text":"Coooookies!!!  It's fall and you know what that means: ginger molasses cookies at Paradise Bakery!  Just when you got tired of the lemon cookies (how could you?), they release their seasonal specialty.  Yum!  But if you must have \"real\" food, they have a great southwest chicken ceasar salad with enough spice to make you guzzle a couple cups of mango iced tea.  Their sandwiches are pretty good, and I'm partial to the turkey with cranberry or the chicken walnut.  Bonus?  You get a cookie for FREE!"}
{"text":"Well... After a long hectic day being stuck in airports, on my last leg, I needed to re-fuel. Paradise cafe was the only thing that seemed appetizing. I ordered the turkey cranberry half sandwich and broccoli cheddar soup. The sandwich came with a cookie. The cookie was nice and warm, the soup was ok, and the turkey cranberry sandwich had no turkey. Trust me, I looked multiple times. I understand things happen but after my day, it's not what I needed."}
{"text":"Paradise Bakery & Cafe is just a codename for Panera Bread Company. And as wikipedia nicely puts it \"As of 2009, it is wholly owned by Panera Bread.\"  I would have to say that, much like Panera Bread, Paradise Bakery and Cafe is just OK. I do like that they have a plethora of options for a traveler on the go like myself, but I don't think that there is anything outstanding about any of those options. I typically will get a half sandwich/half salad or half salad/half soup and while I do have a favorite, I wouldn't go out of my way to get it if I had better options available.   Their seating is severely limited that you probably will have to sit on the seats near your gate and have your meal. Not a fan!   Overall, the items on the menu are fine, but they certainly lack imagination. I do like that they list their calorie count, so for someone who is conscious about what I eat, I can at least eat in peace knowing I'm not stretching my budgeted daily calories. They do offer a free cookie with your entree, which I should add is practically over half of my daily calories worth...I decided to eat it in the span of two days to feel better about it. The chocolate chip cookie was only OK, so it wasn't really worth it to eat all those calories in the end.   Knowing how bad airport food can taste, I give Paradise three stars for being a better airport option than most and having a variety of options for all types of picky eaters."}
{"text":"They changed some of the ingredients so it feels a bit cheaper but still delicious especially the cookies. Great pricing."}
{"text":"Pretty good for airport food. Their menu is just like Panera. They were still open at midnight and the sandwich was great although they were out of the soup I requested. I was surprised after I left to see a free chocolate chip cookie in the bag, bonus points for them (or maybe it was a mistake & I just got lucky)."}
{"text":"There were dirty tables everywhere! Hardly anywhere to sit. Good luck finding a place to sit unless you want to clean your own table! Gross!! At least I know the food is good. This location seems under staffed. If I wasn't in a hurry to catch a movie I would write more right now. Will update later."}
{"text":"Great customer service! Just went to gate C and tried this cafe. At first, I thought it was panera and it basically is (it is owned by the same company). I was greeted with a free cookie, which is always good in my book. I ordered my panera usual, and it was great! Only a little over $7 for half sandwich, half soup! And, to my surprise, it came with a complimentary piece of bread and a cookie! Well worth the walk from Gate D ;)"}
{"text":"Why do all the muffins taste the same -- vaguely pumpkiny/zucchiniy with way too much damn nutmeg?  I'll stick to the tasty tasty tomato soup and salad."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Long waiting time for simple order. Absolutely ZERO customer service. Felt like I was talking to a wall. Also, they got my order wrong and I had to go back. When I asked if I could have the part that they missed, there was no reaction, they simply went and got it and handed it to me. No words were exchanged on their end at all."}
{"text":"We eat out frequently.  This restaurant makes McDonald's look good!  Less than average food, poorly trained personnel and bad decor.  Price just above fast food but...."}
{"text":"Not impressed with the new flat brad sandwiches...bring back the wraps!  I do however love the paradise pasta, salads, soups, chicken walnut croissant-which, and bakery!  The employees are always pleasant and quickly move you through the line.  Unfortunately my member key chain came off and now I can't redeem points towards meals, I have to start all over with a credit card type deal.  One more card to carry around :-\ Overall I have a good experience every time at every location.  Did I mention, BRING BACK THE WRAPS!?"}
{"text":"Sunday Diner's Beware! Tonight they were out of all pasta products, including the Mac & Cheese I was craving. I decided to get soup, however they were also out of rolls. Also, they were out of their Mango Tea. Their excuse for being out of everything I ask for? \"We're normally out of almost everything on Sunday's.\" If this is something that happens every Sunday then whomever orders should be smart enough to plan for it."}
{"text":"FYI this location is now a Panera Bread. Initially I loved the conversion because their Breakfast Souffles are amazing! But today was a major turn off....service was terrible. Not just one but both cashiers had the worst attitude. Quite disappointing..."}
{"text":"Just ok. Quality is like supermarket level. But in The mall, it's ok to have some while shopping in the mall"}
{"text":"Took my mother here after picking her up from the airport. Walked in, place was empty, 5 employees standing at the register all talking ignoring my moms questions about the breakfast sandwiches. Had to keep asking them about what they came with. Being diabetic I get diet soda everywhere I go. Paid for a large soda, the fountain machine was out of all Diet Pepsi, went back to front counter and they said sorry nothing we can do. I can't drink anything else from the soda machine except diet since I am a type 1 diabetic. Their area mat on the ground in front of the soda machines was flipped up and my mom tripped on it and broke her new iPhone 6 Plus screen in the counter edge when she tripped on their mat sticking up. Place was dirty, employees standing around. My ex girlfriend back in 2007 was a manager of some Paradise Bakery's and this was one of her locations for a while. Place was always clean and they where helpful back then, complete opposite now. Very upset I have to go get a new phone for my mom now due to their trip hazard."}
{"text":"Food is always good here, service can be slow, but today was super quick.  They made some mistakes, but in our favor. They were out of soup cups, so I received a bowl.  I asked for a different type of cookie, which I received, but also received a chocolate chip when my sandwich in came.  They gave us an extra roll when my son asked for one, which was nice as well.   My biggest complain is price!! Oh and kids meals no longer include drinks. So add $1.79 each more for a drink."}
{"text":".....just ok... Really miss the cookies from the old paradise bakery, Panera is just not the same! Also feel like it is pricey for what you get. I will say the service was very nice and friendly!"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast. Bagel sandwich was flat, chewy (in a microwaved, bad way) and greasy. Saving grace is their cookies, which are little bits of heaven."}
{"text":"This is one of my staples for lunch on the west side. We don't have many healthy options here, so I usually go here about 1 time a week. I always get the broccoli cheddar soup and possible a salad. I like to get my baby a little PBJ kids meal, and sometimes I eat some of that. The cookies are so good, but I try to avoid them (unsuccessfully) to still eat healthy. I either go to this one or the one on N 67th and the 101.  It can get pretty busy, but this one has lots of seating. The people are always nice and friendly. Sometimes I get confused by how to order. I am used to its sister store Panera where you just go to a counter. Here I always get stuck behind sandwich people and don't know if its ok to cut ahead of them to the salad or soup area.  One thing I wish Paradise would start doing that Panera does is give those cute little apples with meals. I loved those! I would always give them to my horse. It was the perfect horse treat."}
{"text":"Has a convenient location and it is fresher than other Paradise bakeries, however experience is absolutely ruin by bad customer service.  There  is very few people that have customer service here as compared to other locations, most of them are guys! I'm never coming back to this location thanks to the cashier named Lirio."}
{"text":"Before they were bought out by Panera Bread I loved Paradise Bakery.  But I find the line tedious and inefficient -a real waste of my time.  I don't believe I will go back to this location because of how inefficient it is.  The ordering process to the good part of 30 minutes.  The food seems to have fallen in quality while increasing in price.  In addition to poor quality the selections have been drastically reduced. It seems like a twin of Panera now. This makes me long for the days when Paradise Bakery was just that.    -And they have Pepsi not Coke.  Boo!  On an ornery day I would have given them just one star but nostalgia prevents it."}
{"text":"Nice place to get a quick and healthy meal! We had the sandwich and soup combos and kid meals."}
{"text":"What in the hell is going on here today?!   So, normally we come to Paradise for some good sandwiches and of course the cookies, and are never disappointed. But today is another story.  Starting with entering the restaurant, the tables were quite dirty, as if they were short-manned. Understandable if they were. But from the looks of things, they were not.  Then, a customer had vomited in front of the bakery section and continued spewing all the way into the men's restroom creating a Hansel & Gretel trail of \"bread crumbs\" back to his point of origin. Poor guy right? It happens.   What shouldn't happen ensued. It literally took 5 minutes before anyone took action. It then took 5 employees to \"analyze\" the situation. From there, another 10 minutes to clean-up the initial puddle before even moving on. Meanwhile, customers are gagging and turning away at the door! How did it take so long to throw the clumping powder on the mess and sweep it up? It looked as if they had never been trained to clean up spills because it took the chef to come out to show them how it was done. Then! The clean up crew which included the manager left used gloves under the window separator between you and cinnamon buns. Gross!  After the chaos, the food review, I ordered a Club (one of my \"go to's\") and while I was enjoying it, I literally bit into a piece of bacon so hard that it hurt my teeth! For a second, I thought somehow some way, I had bitten into a bone. Insane!   What the hell happened today?!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Love it.   As with most places in the Raintree/FLW area, during lunchtime it gets superduper busy. They have a good layout, and a TON of seating, so this location doesn't get too bad. They always have a friendly greeter handing out cookie bits while you wait in line, and the line moves quick. The menu is well laid out (better than other Paradise locations) and the food is top notch.  Their side (overflow) room is great for seating a group of people, and they have a tv in there too (unusual for Paradise). Couldn't be better. Plus they have free wifi. Bring the laptop and stay a while.  Only complaint is that its a tiny bit pricy, but considering what you get, its worth it. Half salad, half sandwich, drink and a cookie (best part) is around $10."}
{"text":"I stopped by here this past Saturday with my fiance for a pick me up after the long flight from Pittsburgh to Phoenix.  There wasn't much to the restaurant as it is set in a food court type setting in the Phoenix airport although I will say that they had a number of good looking pastries and cakes behind the glass which you could order.  After perusing the menu I was disappointed to see that they only had regular coffee and not anything special.  However my fiance wanted some green tea and was happy that she had two choices.  In addition to that she spotted a mini carrot cake behind the glass and decided that she wanted it as well.  My coffee ended up being just ok and while it wasn't great it was not too bad either.  The fiance had a much better time of it though as she loved the tea that she had and thought that the carrot cake was good as well.  The bottom line for me is that I might stop back here again in the future.  While I was disappointed that they didn't have any specialty coffees, I was really impressed by their cake selection and loved the idea/price for their mini cake bites."}
{"text":"I use to be a big fan of this place before they started f#%^king up their whole menu and serving crap. Some people claimed they didn't get shit on their sandwich and it's true. The sandwich I got pretty much had nothing in it and it was smaller that a half of a half a sandwich WTF?!? Only reason I came here was because my girlfriend was near that area for work and we met their for lunch. Talk about $30 for less food that you get from an Applebee's sample! And seriously with the price for a bowl of soup and the damn thing looks like a tiny cup. I'm not one to expect a lot of food when I order something but I also want more than a cracker and cheese stick for $30 bucks! Will I return ummmmmm NO."}
{"text":"Got the roasted turkey and avocado BLT.  Light yet satisfying  at a reasonable price at the airport.  The service was very friendly and helpful.  Would definitely return for the same item."}
{"text":"If you like crescents!! they have one of the most buttered and soft crescents i've ever had outside of Europe.  They are not half mooned shaped but a bit flatter and wider....all it's missing is some cheese!!! Wooooo...making me hungry as we speak.  Also they have the best fresh baked cookies in town!! Just as good as Specialty's! and not sooo sweet!!  Go out and grab a cookie for the road!"}
{"text":"Quality of food seems to have changed, I used to really enjoy going here but now it seems there are better options out there. Service also is lacking I would rather go to a place where I don't feel like I'm bothering them just to get waited on."}
{"text":"The chipotle chicken panini was delicious and large.  Very hot, flavorful, juicy, and reasonably priced (especially for an airport).  They even gave me a delicious chocolate chip cookie.  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Its the only good thing about the Phoenix airport.  Fresh sandwiches and delicious pastries.  you get a fresh baked cookie with every sandwich.  Healthy and delicious, give it a try."}
{"text":"It's Paradise Bakery, so you know what you're getting. Pretty good food, at a decent price. Salads are always great, and you can't beat the cookies. And the atmosphere is pretty solid for lunch meetings, dinner with someone, etc. Very casual, but not overly so.  One gripe I have about this location: service times always seem slower here. Like there's people trying to stay busy doing other things and not exactly expediting the process of moving customers through the line. There are definitely some great people working here, but for example, the other night I waited almost 30 minutes for a sandwich and a half for a to go order. Not worth that kind of wait while my soup is cooling off, you know?"}
{"text":"Clean, quick, good service and excellent salad/sandwich options."}
{"text":"Always clean, good service and good tasting food."}
{"text":"Whatever, so it's a chain. I have one sandwich I order here all the time - Tuscan Chicken. It's pretty amazing with sliced chicken breast, big ol' basil leaves, tomato, pesto, and a spicy olive tapenade, all on ciabatta.  It's so, so good. And now the bad news.....................it's going away.  Slowly all of the Paradises are being shifted to the Panera menu, which has nothing remotely close to this sandwich on it. The \"mall\" locations like this one will be the last to convert, according to an employee I asked. I am very sad to know that my days with Tuscan Chicken are numbered.  Other stuff - fast and friendly service always at this location. Cookies are great (as is the cream cheese brownie!)."}
{"text":"Paradise is one of my favorite breakfast and lunch spots.  This location, although provides what I expect, does lack customer service.  Employees assume all customers are regulars, and get short when asked questions about the menu."}
{"text":"\"Yelpers report this location closed.\"    That is not true. The restaurant is open.   Funny how one can't easily contact Yelp to let them know about this and other."}
{"text":"This is by far the best bakery you're going to get. Their muffins and crossaints are excellent and always fresh!  The service is  also excellent. Will be coming back here."}
{"text":"After careful consideration of wanting to not have to do a review I feel that I need to do this. I hope that the managers of the store make the appropriate changes. I came in to sit down because I scheduled a meet up. As I sit down there were numerous tables that were unbused and there is a sign on the door that said they were closing early today for a meeting. When you have people that are going to have a meet up at your place and assume that you are open, either change your hours online or have a meeting after closing hours.  Then as the busser came by and cleaned up the table I thought that was excellent that he actually got paper towels to dry off the white table so I can put my laptop down. However what seals the deal on two stars is that the music is so obnoxious and so loud that I can't even hear myself think which makes this a terrible place to have a meeting. Also be aware of your demographic. Understand that people that are coming to your store are not the people that are listening to music from the 1950s literally.  Severely annoyed. For the record, I waited three visits to of terrible music to write this review.  Extra bonus. PISS POOR WIFI. Remembering that fact just brought you back to one star."}
{"text":"I would put no stars at all if that were possible... I went in today for the black bean soup.  My cashier's name was Raquel.  When I asked for a pint of soup she looked at me as if I didn't know what I was talking about and with attitude asks, \"did you mean the group soup?\" (I've worked at Paradise Bakery.  On the computer it does say group soup, but if you know your job you would also know that \"group soup\" comes in a pint-sized container.)  I agreed that yes I want to group soup, and asked if I can also get a side of pepper jack cheese to go with it.  She said \"Let me go ask how to ring that up.\"  She came back with a guy named Renee who promptly told me \"We don't sell our cheese.\"  I said \"I understand that but I just bought soup, I can't get a side of cheese with my soup?\"  He said \"Well our cheese is more expensive than our soup.\" Raquel then interrupts him with so much attitude in her voice and says \"Target sells cheese.  Why don't you get pepper jack cheese at target?\" I left without buying anything after this remark.  THANK YOU RAQUEL, for pointing out that I can buy cheese at target.  Come to think of it, I can also buy SOUP."}
{"text":"So I felt the need to Yelp this ONLY because I feel like it's important for the ownership of this chain to address this particular issue.. My boy friend and I walked in at 8:05 PM an hour before closing and we had asked if they had any bread bowls left.. The guy in a blue shirt, who seemed to have been the manager stopped what he was doing and his response was \"NO of course we don't have bread bowls, we are all out!  that's what happens when you come in 30 minutes before closing!\" I'm sorry? But you had an hour left of work... it's not like we walked in 5 mins before closing.. My boy friend and I turned around and went to Jimmy Johns across the way. I am always VERY conscious about going into places IF they're close to closing. But this was not the case at all. Sorry you're so unhappy with your job buddy, maybe a job with NO customer service would be good for ya."}
{"text":"Awesome salad and soup combo.  Too bad the very good (and healthy) food is marred by sime of the worst service with terrible attitude ever!  And the place is filthy with dirty tables and overflowing trash cans."}
{"text":"I came upon Paradise Bakery by chance and just stopped by to have a drink and something sweet. We ordered a caramel ice, snickerdoodle cookie, and a sugar cookie. They were all okay, but not fantastic. I think it's a little pricey for what it is. The inside was pretty nice and seemed like a nice place to study or read, but I probably wouldn't choose to go back."}
{"text":"Five things Fuji Apple Chicken Salad, Macadamia Nut Cookies, Mango tea, Blueberry Acia tea, awesome customer service! All things that make me come back here. I don't know what else they have it's all I ever have lol."}
{"text":"Did the line thing, got a walnut chicken salad sandwich and salad to split with a friend. Liked them. This place serves a purpose. It has some variety, and is somewhat able to customize your order. Its an option. Sometimes you get stuck in a terminal with one scary place to eat and drink. This was a better choice..."}
{"text":"One tip, don't go here.  Food was mediocre at best, the service was terrible.  I believe it was the manager, who didn't make any effort to apologize for sloppy service and our botched order.   First off, they offer the Asiagio bagel sammich, but they don't have Asiago bagels..  oh well.  Well then I see they make 2 of our sammiches, watching the bacon fall out when the dunce is wrapping it, thankfully not all of it fell out.  Then I watched and waited as they make about 6-8 sammiches.  That's when I asked if they were going to get me the 3 toasted bagels, the very simple toasted plain bagels.  That's when Mr. Manager started acting like a (insert the word you're thinking I'm going to write).  And they started to make inroads into toasting the bagels, while they're sammich line went full steam.    Thankfully I got to the plane before boarding finished, took way to long.   They were not efficient and did not apologize, nor recognize their errors.  I WILL NEVER GO HERE AGAIN.  I have few 1 star reviews and I usually don't complain like this, but I was pissed at their service."}
{"text":"We were looking for a Einstein Bros and found out the one closest to the mall wasn't open yet so we came here for bagels. They don't have a great selection but it was pretty good! Kinda pricey but the bagel and cream cheese was like $3 bucks so not bad at all. Their cookies looked great so we will have to come back and try some. Located in the food court at the mall so kinda disappointed with the location but convenient."}
{"text":"I've been to a few different Paradise Bakeries before and this one is no different. You can either call ahead or wait in line. Sometimes, waiting in line is worth it as there's this really sweet lady who walks around handing out fresh from the oven cookies. I normally order a sandwich (bacon turkey bravo) but their soups and salads are good too. I like their french onion soup the best and the roll that comes with it is a perfect accompaniment. The food is consistently good and the employees are generally friendly and accommodating. The one thing I don't like is the location. Sure, it's close to work and is perfect for lunch, but the parking is atrocious. It's difficult to get in, it's difficult to get out, and good luck finding a space! I'd recommend coming either before or after the lunch rush."}
{"text":"Just had the Fiji Apple Chicken Salad...Excellent!!!"}
{"text":"Of all the Paradise Bakery outlets this one is sub-par, because every single time I am there it seems as if the staff is more interested in talking among themselves than serving customers. However, this morning I did buy their ham and cheese omelet which was salty with a cap S.  Why so much salt? And the ham is a very thin slice of processed ham cut into teeny slices  Really?  For $7?  I can do alot better at IHop or Denny's and--guess what--I will next time, Paradise Bakery in Peoria. Get your crap together and give better service, lay off any salt (my gosh, lots of people 55+ live around there, so do you really think they want alot of salt in their food?) and get a real slice of ham to cut up not some thin processed slice of ham meat or whatever it was. Big disappointment here! Oh, I left out the best part:  One of the older retired gents who is a regular there with his wife asked to read part of my paper, and asked me if I liked it there.  Seems they eat there regularly, so he wants people to like the place.  I told him about the salt, so he goes to the Manager and tells that person who stated they would be over.  Did they ever come over or even send anyone to inquire about the horrid meal?  Uh...no.   Again, get it together over there, Paradise!"}
{"text":"They have gone full Panera. No cookie, no crumbly blue salad, slow checkout. Everything I used to love is gone. The place is relatively empty compared to how full it used to be at lunch. This will be our last visit ever.   Please turn it back into a Paradise."}
{"text":"Romaines, chicken breast, strawberries,  pineapple, pecans, blueberries, mandarin oranges and some unknown dressing that it probably didn't even need.  It tastes like fresh ginger is in there too -maybe that's the dressing.  Sooo fresh tasting but not at all heavy. And that's just my half salad. Half of a Tomato Mozzarella cibatta sandwich.  Undecided about this.  Sounded much better than what it looks like and how it tastes.  Bread is very fresh, actually it's fantastic, but the sauce, the three measly pieces of mozz, and two thin slices of tomato just don't seem to contribute to what I anticipated.  At least give me whole leaves of basil.  C'mon.  If i had to decide between salad or sandwich there's no doubt I would stick with the fantastic salad."}
{"text":"I had never visited a Paradise Bakery so I thought I'd give it a try.  Their prices seemed reasonable ecspecially for an aiport location.  My wife said they usually have PB&J for kids.  I noticed it wasn't on the menu, but they did have it when I asked.  It was part of a kids meal that came with Gogurt and a cookie.  I'm not sure why they didn't have it on the menu.  I ordered a Cranberry turkey sandwhich and custimzed my order to take off the tomato and add cucumber.  I only mention this because my Mom and Wife were told by another cashier that they were not able to custimize sandwhiches.  I thought that was odd.  Either I had a nice cashier or they had a mean one I'm not sure which.  It wasn't busy so I thought he should have custimized their sandwhichs.  Maybe he was just lazy.  Overall I thought it was a good place with good food."}
{"text":"Fail...AGAIN!  Any place that charges 8 whopping dollars for a horrendous meatLESS half sandwich and disappointing tasteless soup deserves not even a cent from me.   Attempt 1: ordered a cranberry turkey sandwich on white bread with no mayo. Received: cranberry turkey sandwich on wheat bread with slabs of mayo; let me add: was pre-made! They didn't even bother reading my request!  Attempt 2: ordered a cranberry turkey sandwich AGAIN...this time with no special treatment. Received: shockingly sloppy job of throwing together ONE thinnnn slice of turkey barely held together by a toothpick.  Overrpiced, overrated, under par. The lines are too long at lunch, the prices are too high and the people are too pretentious.  Disappointed time and time again, I hope to not return as long I can can walk my butt over to where my skinny wallet is appreciated more: to the land of the 5 dollar footlongs."}
{"text":"This specific location operates a large towing service sting operation. I have seen countless cars get towed away if the people getting out of their cars are not seen walking towards this establishment. Guys will watch the people and radio for a tow truck and immediately their car will be impounded.   I never did like this sandwich shop but this solidifies why many of us will never step foot in this place again. Skipping this ace at all costs."}
{"text":"I ordered the steel cut oatmeal with blueberries it showed up with no spoon seven blueberries and without any appeal whatsoever lackluster at best"}
{"text":"I was a former Paradise Junkie.  The last few times I have eaten here the service has been poor and the food quality is hit or miss.  Today was no exception.  The girl taking orders for salads was so rude I literally just walked out.  If I'm paying $10 for a salad I want to at least be treated politely."}
{"text":"If  you want a taste of PARADISE look no further Paradise Bakery & Cafe has what you need. Their menu has the basic essentials and then sum for soups, salads, sandwiches and baked goods. They advertise everything is made from scratch and always fresh which I know first hand as I am a frequent patron here. If your passing through Phoenix Sky Harbor and would like to satisfy your appetite this will be the place I highly recommend. For starters I would order a \"half combination\" which consist of a half sandwich half soup, half sandwich half salad or a half salad half soup. Paradise has a variety of sandwich choices from chicken, turkey, ham or even a vegetarian sandwich to go along with a wide selection of your choice of bread. Soups? take your pick depending on what day of the week it is is what they have available, however they always have their house special soup called the Roasted Tomatoe soup which they top off with crispy tortilla strips and a drizzle of sour cream and given a freshly oven baked dinner roll to compliment your soup. If a light salad is what your more in the mood for they can assist with that at the salad bar where you will feel empowered to make your choices known of what you would like your salad to turn out to be and while your at it don't forget to pick up a chocolate chip cookie, carrot cake, bagel or cinnamon roll all freshly baked from the oven.  OASN: Soups are not permitted through security, however salad dressing in packets or small containers 3 ounces or less then are TSA and Airline permitted. Lastly, Paradise also has a just for kids menu which consist of Macaroni and cheese, Turkey or Ham sandwich or Peanut Butter & Jelly.  Now go and get a taste of PARADISE!"}
{"text":"If you want to look for Paradise Bakery, they moved to a smaller location in Concourse C. The good thing is that they have three registers to try and move customers in and out quickly.  I just got coffee, water and a zucchini nut muffin.  Not as good as going to their restaurants, but their food is still on the mark."}
{"text":"Ordered a bacon, egg, and cheese with avacado on asiago. There were no assuage bagels... fine I'll take a plain bagel. There were no eggs left, only egg whites... ok I'm hungry, that works. Get my sandwich, walk to my gate, and there's no avacado. Next time I'll just eat Wendy's."}
{"text":"Poor service. I had a bad experience there today. I walked to the counter and ordered a ham, egg and cheese sandwich. The cashier Bobby said something I could not make out. I repeated \"ham, egg and cheese sandwich.\" \"The power sandwich?\" he asks. I look up at the menu and say \"I don't know I would like the sandwich that says \"ham, egg and cheese.\" I glance at the menu again and notice that the heading of some sandwiches says \"power sandwiches\" in a smaller font. The thing is they only serve one ham, egg and cheese sandwich, so why the need for clarification? Bobby gives me a number and I find a table and wait. I wait for nearly 20 minutes. This is no exaggeration, as I had the time ordered, on my receipt.  I hear a lady with a thick accent calling out a few times. I believed she was calling my number. I went to the front put down my number, took the bag left on the counter and went back to my table. I start eating and its not my sandwich. I go back to the counter and apparently I had taken someone else's sandwich. The manager just looked at me and shook her head. They made the waiting man's sandwich and then made mine. Where was my sandwich to begin with? Do the breakfast sandwiches usually take 20 minutes to make, maybe that was my mistake and I didn't wait long enough. The whole experience was frustrating to say the least."}
{"text":"Just to clarify, this review is for the one at terminal 2-united. This one isn't open 24hrs. In fact I just barely made it when I ordered at 6:55 pm. But I got to redeem  my free cookie for parking at Blue Sky.  I got the shrimp and soba salad. First off, the girl who made it seemed like she was making it for the first time.  She kept looking at the menu to check the ingredients and then had her manager look in the box to make sure it looked right. Overall though it was ok. The soba noodles were that stiffness that you get with cold noodles sometimes so that wasn't so good. The orange miso was eh. It also comes with spinach, a cabbage mix and peanut sauce. Sounds yummy but I'd say pass. Staff there were cordial enough but didnt really seem that excite to be there. I think one reviewer was right in that maybe everyone there are trainees."}
{"text":"Very good turkey and cranberry sandwich.  All fresh ingredients and fresh bread.  Plus a free cookie. Will have to stop by next time in Phoenix airport near gates C14."}
{"text":"Huge choice of sandwiches, salads, and soups.  Also many bakery items.  Everything was good, only drawback for me is food does taste mass produced  ie salad dressing tastes very generic, nothing special, and the chocolate chip cookie has a wee bit of a non homemade taste to it, maybe preservatives?  They were good texture, and had lots of chips ;)"}
{"text":"Their food remains very good  their service is a disorganized mess - too many people; too little interest; clueless management; occasional missing salad ingredients; changing menu - with no memory of \"yesterday's\" [\"you could never have gotten that at a PB\"].    attitude:  the customer is confused - when they caused it!   e.g. used to get drinks at the cash register - yesterday they looked at me like i was weird and told me to go back to the \"barista\" - like \"everyone knows that, dummy\"  there has to be another place to get good sandwiches and salad - seach started!"}
{"text":"Considering I work in the airport, I know lines are long and most of the employees hate their jobs. I get it. But when you ask for no mayonnaise because your ALLERGIC, you'd think to include that part on the note so it can be conveyed to the sandwich maker. Nope. Never happens, the managers are sweethearts, but the employees they need to check into. 4 out of 5 times I get mayonnaise & a dirty look . And sometimes if your extra lucky they will even leave the plastic on the cheese slices for you when you bite into your sandwich.  Honestly the one star is for the managers. If I could give the restaurant less stars I would."}
{"text":"BEWARE- Food Dye in soup. Only 2 of their soups were labeled AN - 'All Natural.'  Hmm... So what makes the Tomato Soup not receive the all natural label? Of course I asked - seemed to be the shift manager that day in the salad bar area said she would check for me (but acted quite annoyed to have to go through the process). I did not want to bother anyone but if I am going to be eating something - and/or feeding it to my child, I would certainly like to know what the heck is in it. She let me know that the Tomato soup has Red and Blue Food Dye. Seriously Paradise??? Have they never seen the studies that Food Dyes are dangerous for kiddos? It is really frustrating when businesses advertise something that is seemingly healthy-ish (don't get me wrong I assumed there was some cream) - but really they are throwing scary additives.   Moral of the story - visit the local restaurants who make things from scratch, and don't need to dye their tomato soup to make it red. Tomatoes are red!"}
{"text":"Really good place to stop and grab lunch while at the airport. I had the California club and really enjoyed having something healthy."}
{"text":"The food was excellent!  So many great choices!  Salads and panini was delish!"}
{"text":"Every time I have a layover here I get the delicious club that comes with turkey and ham on a croissant and some yummy mustard spread. All sandwiches come with one free chocolate chip cookie and it is to die for."}
{"text":"I will never give this Paradise Bakery location my business again due to the repeated mistakes and delays with my catering orders, and the lack of customer service and solutions from the manager. It has happened at least three times that I go to pick up a catering order at the agreed-upon time only to find the staff bumbling to locate my order sheet and then sloppily putting my order together while I'm waiting an extra 20 minutes. No apologies from the staff, and then the order isn't even correct and is missing lunches. I spoke with the manager about the apparent breakdown in their catering process and he reassured me that he would get my next order right. Did that happen? Nope. It was missing 3 lunches, soup and they didn't even label any of the sandwiches. Too bad - they lost a lot of business from my company."}
{"text":"I met a friend here for lunch this afternoon. Going to a Paradise Bakery was a regular lunch spot for us back when we used to work together.  The food is fantastic and the cookies are amazing. The big problem for me is the price.   My lunch was a sandwich, which comes with a \"free\" chocolate chip cookie, and a small ice tea. It cost a little more $10. While not exorbitant, still quite a few dollars for a place which is just a step or two over fast food. If I'm paying that much for a drink and sandwich, I would like to have full service. Not order from the counter and have someone bring it out when it's ready.   I like hitting Paradise Bakery up once in a while.  If you're looking for good food, it's worth it.  Just be ready to pay a little more for it."}
{"text":"I'm very unimpressed with this location.   I prefer to avoid Paradise Bakery, and hit up other sandwich spots for lunch. I find their food good but a little overpriced. But today, I decided it was convenient to stop by Tempe Market Place on my way home from work, and I wanted a sandwich, so why not?   I realized right away that this PB has a smaller menu than some of the others that I've hit up. That was an instant minus. I don't go to Paradise often enough to notice something like that. I settled for a Chicken Artichoke Panini. It was mediocre at best. On the plus side, it comes with a chocolate chip cookie. PB's cookies are a 100/10.   I'm also not a fan of the set up of this location. If you don't have a table and/or are getting something to go, the only place to wait for your food is a small area in the middle of restaurant.  It's extremely awkward, and you always feel like you're in someone's way.  There is one other plus I need to mention from a previous trip.  I once went in before work and was wearing my security card on a lanyard around my neck.  The cashier thought I was a Tempe Market Place employee and gave me a 10% discount.  How nice."}
{"text":"I had a \"punkin nut\" muffin and coffee here while waiting for my flight...people were friendly and knowledgable, quick and the muffin was as good as anything I have had at a chain coffee shop before.  I recommend it to anyone flying out of PHX!"}
{"text":"Literally the worst coffee I've ever had. This is saying a lot since I've driven coast to coast and had truck stop coffee in over half the states. Really amazing. We took a few sips and asked the flight attendant to dump them out as soon as we boarded. She said, \"I know exactly where you got this\" and named Paradise Bakery. Apparently this place has a reputation."}
{"text":"Best price and quality at the airport. Hands down. After coming to the airport weekly and rarely getting to eat this place took the pain out of it and it felt normal to my wallet for a change."}
{"text":"Yikes! Coming here was an honest mistake. I was looking for somewhere somewhat healthy and came across this location. I decided to get the Pick 2 meal where I could get smaller portions of participating items on  the menu. I decided to get the Turkey Cranberry sandwich and the Southwest Chicken Caesar Salad. My sandwich was okay however my cranberry was running everywhere. It dropped liquid all over the plate and was a messy eat. My salad ended up not having enough dressing so it ended up dry. My lunch date got the new Bosa Bowl and it wasn't even halfway filled; waste of $8. Trying out one of the new smoothies was terrible as well. You spend $5 for a size that was more of kid size; Jamba Juice gives you more bang for your buck! Lastly the soda machine sprayed soda all over you when you filled your drink and there were no napkins. I will not ever go back!"}
{"text":"I love Paradise Bakery. It is a good place for a good healthy snack or lunch. It is a nice lil cafe. The staff were very respectful and I didn't wait long at all to get my order."}
{"text":"Yet another reason for me to love Paradise Bakery. Awhile back right when spring break was coming to an end I was supposed to pick up my friend from Sky Harbor and we were going to drive back to NAU the next day. Unfortunately she is from Vermont and her flight kept getting pushed back more and more due to bad weather so I ended up waiting an extra hour and half at least. Luckily there was a Paradise Bakery right there with some coffee and cookies to keep me happy. Whoever thought of putting them in that terminal is genius! Thank you!   Also they have this new cookie called a Lemon Fritter...if you like lemon and sugar cookies you need to try it!"}
{"text":"We had breakfast here so no cookie, but the food was still good. My husband got a sticky bun that was good sized and I got steel cut oats with strawberries and brown sugar. I was a little worried because I usually put milk on my oatmeal and none was offered but the oatmeal was still creamy it was generously dressed with about a half cup of fresh, good quality fruit."}
{"text":"It was okay. The line went pretty fast for a busy airport food location. I think what was most annoying (and what makes this place just okay) was that they ran out of everything I ordered after I ordered it. They didn't have the soup I asked for, so I got something else. They didn't have the dressing for the salad I ordered, so I got something else. I don't think that's something I should have to do after I pay for my meal. You know? I could understand one, but... both? And when I didn't want the salad without the correct dressing, the employee seemed annoyed that I would want a different salad. Otherwise, the food was good. They give you a free chocolate chip cookie with your order. I think that was the best part of the meal, because it was a really delicious cookie."}
{"text":"Overall very good but just a little pricey for what I like.  Soups are great though."}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast and lunch places!! So many options amd everything is delicious!!"}
{"text":"This a great deli, by airports standards or otherwise.  They have a fairly limited menu, but the food is great quality.  There are sandwiches, wraps, salads, and fresh pastries.  Service is always friendly and prompt, which is great when you're rushing to a flight. Try the turkey and cranberry sandwich, it is great! This is my go to for a quick meal before heading to the security line."}
{"text":"I'm a fan again, now that they have changed their menu.  I used to love the chicken ranch they took away years ago so I avoid this place now.  I had to stop it this past week since I am sick of the same old stuff near my home and noticed they have masculine food here now.  I ordered a steak & white cheddar panini that was fantastic!  I have to try a few others now so I will probably be coming back.  I also ordered a cup of clam chowder that was pretty darn good as well.  The atmosphere at this location is nice but I still stay away from breakfast here.  The cookies and baked goods are always great."}
{"text":"I get food here a lot, it's not even funny. Why? I travel for a living and it's the  perfect place to grab food on the fly. Great selection of salads, sandwiches and soups. Well maybe not the soups since you can't bring it past the security, but the rest of the food in the menu can be easily brought to the aircraft.  Packing food when traveling has to be done in true survival mode these days, so an experienced jet setter has to be prepared. What do I recommend?   I always get the Crumbly Blue Cheese salad which contains romaine lettuce with crumbled gorgonzola, dried cranberries & sunflower seeds  and also the Southwestern Caesar Salad with Southwest dressing. Both are vegetarian and totally tasty. The small dressing containers are perfect for traveling. They are airline permitted and TSA approved.  I don't care for their breakfast bagels though since the eggs are microwaved, but I've always enjoyed their vegetarian sandwiches with avocado.   Scrumptious and delish! Halleloo!!!"}
{"text":"Had lunch today 1/2 soup and sandwich.   Delicious chicken salad sandwich with walnuts.  Super!  And cheese and brocolli soup..... nummers!  The kids white macaroni and cheese.....mmmmm.  Their cookies are way too sweet for me...toooo many chocolate chips for my taste.  But the rest of the family love them.  Super service.  Managed by the wonderful and talented Sue...who used to manage the Paradise at Biltmore.  Lucky to have her! Jon"}
{"text":"Like Mark Wahlberg in his new movie \"Annoyed & Confused\" I was saying to myself as I looked at my salad at 30,000 feet, 'Huh, What's going on here?, What the &*%^$?\" This salad had me confused.  I ordered the Southwest Chile Lime Salad and what I got was some weird fusion that they totally messed up on . You know what? It worked!!  Paradise has a leg up on many of the salads that you might purchase in an airport as they make them to order. This is a huge plus but it is what caused my salad to have different ingredients than expected. I have had too many pre made salads with wilted greens at airports so made to order is a big plus in my book.  The Southwest Chile Lime Salad, per the menu, was (Smoked, pulled chicken, romaine, arugula, adobo corn blend, quinoa tomato sofrito blend, fresh cilantro and masa crisps tossed in freshly made chile lime rojo ranch and topped with feta and avocado.) Near as I can tell they blended that recipe with the Southwest Caeser (Chicken raised without antibiotics, romaine,pepper jack and tortilla strips tossed with spicy chipotle Caesar dressing). My salad came with (Chicken, Avocado, Pickled Red Onion, Red Pepper, Roasted Corn, Feta & Tortilla Strips with the Spicy Chipotle) and we will call it the the Southwest Caeser Josh. It was delicious!! The  corn was nicely roasted. The chicken was flavorful and generous and the tortilla gave a great crunch. The veggies were all fresh. The dressing had a good heat and when they say large they mean it. I was stuffed!!  Paradise Bakery is a chain with locations in Arizona, Texas, Nebraska & Utah and obviously are located at Sky Harbor. They used to have locations in California but pulled out. I visited them in Pleasanton, CA. many  years ago when I wore a younger mans clothes. I will be back and if you visit ask for my fusion salad."}
{"text":"This place has sandwiches, soups, pastas, and cookies.    Both the steak sandwich and turkey bacon sandwich are decent.  Was able to grab quick sandwich before our connection flight.  Husband really liked the cookies."}
{"text":"Still enjoy this place but ever since it was taken over by Panera bread it has lost it's charm, unique food choices and is no longer special."}
{"text":"My last visit here. Turning it into a Panera bread.  Good by Paradise... I will miss you!!"}
{"text":"(I'm guessing) unpopular opinion: I'm generally not a fan of the freestanding Paradise Bakery locations, and actually prefer the condensed mall versions.   I guess it's because for years I was only familiar with the one in Fashion Square & got used to there menu, & when I started working close to the one on Scottsdale Rd & I forget where (I think Doubletree?) I hated it. I didn't really care for any of the expanded options that weren't offered at the mall locations (I'm still not) & the line system confused me. If you're ONLY getting a salad go here, but if you're getting a salad AND soup go there, but if you want a sandwich go here. Blah, blah, blah. To make things worst, somebody (sometimes you ) always gets accused of cutting, which causes even more commotion.   That's where this location is a step above the other freestanding Paradise Bakeries. For whatever reason they seem to be more organized & efficient, and despite how busy they can get during lunch they keep things moving.   As far as the food goes, I've always found things to be pretty consistent at any Paradise Bakery (which means fresh & tasty, but nothing that's going to blow you away...except the tomato soup...when the weather isn't hot THAT stuff is pretty awesome!), and this location is no different. I pretty much tend to stick the soups (weather permitting, obvi), the BLT, the club, and some of the salads. I also love the chocolate chip cookies that come with most things, but I absolutely LOVE the sugar cookies from the bakery! They're so thick, sugary, & batter-y (I made that word up)."}
{"text":"I recently reviewed the Paradise Bakery in Old Town, and gave it 4 stars basically saying I'm generally not a huge of the freestanding locations & actually prefer the condensed mall versions. Reason being, I think they have a disorganized ordering process/line system/payment area. For whatever reason, however, the Old Town location is more organized.   Well, this particular Paradise Bakery is a more typical free-standing location. Me & my mother both ordered a half sandwich & soup. We ordered our sandwiches as soon as we walked in & then there was this moment of should we/shouldn't we cut in front of the people ordering salads to get our soups (we did, and although nothing was said to us we definitely got a couple dirty looks).   That being said, I generally like Paradise Bakery. Like all the rest, this location is clean & the food is good (nothing spectacular, but good)."}
{"text":"Your standard Paradise Bakery, but with more disorganized service.  I do prefer eating here than some fast food burger joint you would usually find at the airport though."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a last minute birthday treat for my sons 5th birthday. I had been working all day and was so exhausted but hoping to order a last minute pizza cookie for my son. Unfortunately you have to place your orders for that one day prior so I wasn't able to order the pizza cookie.  I was kind of disappointed and one of the staff members must have noticed my disappointment so she immediately offered to try to create a happy birthday cookie on a smaller cookie rather then the large pizza size cookie. It was an incredibly kind gesture which turned out to be amazing! Having someone go out of their way to make something so special for my son meant the world to me. We need more kindness like that in this world.  Thank you Paradise Bakery staff. You will be seeing much more of me!!!"}
{"text":"My letter to corporate about Paradise Bakery even after i received a $10 gift card for the previous mess-up.   Save yourself time and go somewhere else...This place is disgusting   While I greatly appreciate the $10 gift card, I will not be using it.  I went to to the Superstition Springs Mall Paradise Bakery location on Sept 28th around 4:30pm and sampled the Tuna Fish.  It was disgusting.  It was a basically tasted more mayo than anything and I basically had to spit it out. I even asked a few of the employees what happened to the quality and they basically admitted after Panera took over Paradise, the overall quality went down and the company was focusing on profits over quality.  Overall, it's a unfortunate disappointment because I always enjoyed going to Paradise and I have been a loyal club member for the last several years and have accumulated tons of points.  I know this, I will not be returning to any Paradise Bakery as this company feels to overlook quality.    If you want to see what tuna fish taste should like, go to Wildflower Bakery located on Val Vista and Baseline. Hell you should take notes because the manager even stated they are increasing their sales significantly since Paradise Bakery went to hell.    If not, then please send me an address that i can return this gift card to.  I was going to give this to another family member, but i love my family.  Best Regards,"}
{"text":"Added Additional Food Items -  8/1/13  Customer Service - Top Notch!!!    I hang my head in shame to admit that according the visits on my receipt, I've been to this Paradise a total of 51 times.  LOL  Soups/Salads/Sandwiches:   Summer Corn Chowder -  Two Thumbs Up  Broccoli Cheese - Thumbs Up Fire Roasted Tomato - Thumbs Up Garden Vegetable with Pesto - Thumbs Up Mac & Cheese - Thumbs Up  Strawberry Poppyseed & Chicken - Thumbs up!  This is my first time ordering a \"salad\".  It was pretty good, but I think I'll ask them though to only use half a spoonful of dressing when I get a half salad again.  I would get it on the side, but I like how they toss the salad, distributing the dressing.   Sierra Turkey - Very dry.  Checked and only had a small dab of the spread is on the sandwich.  Onion was too overpowering.  Bacon Turkey Bravo - My go to sandwich.  Nuff Said Tuna Sandwich - WAY too much mayo.  Not ordering again.  Frontega Chicken - Thumbs Up Paradise Club - Thumbs Up Pasta Salad - Thumbs Up  Cookies:  Chocolate Chip - Two Thumbs Up Oatmeal - Two Thumbs Up  I'll add more to this list as I try other menu items...."}
{"text":"J and I went to this Paradise location while we were out last night.  He'd never been to a Paraside before.  Since it was after 6pm, the OldTown Scottsdale location was closed.  But, since we had to go out to Mesa, he reminded me of the Tempe Marketplace location.    With such a busy location, you'd think that the restaurant would be clean.  Nope.  Trash on the floors.  Dirty tables.  We had to walk around for a minute before we found a clean empty table.  J was so put off by the dirty tables surrounding ours that he got up and asked to speak to the manager.  The manager, from what J stated, was like...Yeahhhhhhhhhh..I know.  He knows his employees are doing a half assed job on keeping the dining area clean and isnt doing anything about it to make sure its clean ALL THE TIME?!  Now to the food.    We split a Paradise Club.  It seemed as if this sandwich was just thrown together.  Very dry.  J was not at all impressed.    I had a cup of Mac & Cheese and J had a bowl of Mac & Cheese.   Im guessing since the mac & cheese is in individual packages, they cook them in a sous vide.   J's came from a batch that had not been cooked yet.  The guy says, this ones cold, so I have to heat it up.  He then throws the cup in the microwave.  Uhhh..okay.  J said his was alright.  He had a little left over and gave me the rest of his.  Why did the mac taste chewy.  Like it had not been cooked all the way?  Though seeing the bowl being put in the microwave, I should have known something would have been off.  But I was not expecting chewy macaroni.    After everything was said and done, I wish the OldTown Scottsdale would have been open!  Because I unfortunately don't think I'll be able to get J to step foot in another Paradise after this experience."}
{"text":"I was happy when they built this location because it's so close by! They are always friendly when we come in, and we always get our food quickly, no matter what time of the day we come in."}
{"text":"I just love paradise bakery! I was so happy that they finally opened a location closer to my home that isn't in the mall - great idea. I came here about a week ago to pick up a quick to-go dinner. Manuela was great - super friendly, made sure to see if I wanted the dressing mixed or on the side, etc. I always appreciate genuine customer service. Of course I'll be back, I could probably eat p.bakery everday. Oh, and the cookies are always my favorite :)"}
{"text":"By far my favorite restaurant at an airport. And I've been to plenty of airports (and plenty of airport restaurants). This place is worth the bumpy ride to Phoenix in the dead of summer (114 degrees, anyone?) ;). The customer service here is top notch, and the cookies are SO delicious! I recommend the chocolate chip and/or the snickerdoodle. They often have deals on the cookies where you can BOGO. I also highly recommend their broccoli cheddar soup. It's so yummy! Thanks, Paradise :)!"}
{"text":"I was a fan of this place till they started taking all the best sandwiches off the menu a few years back. Hoping they would someday return, I would find myself trying whatever was left. They recently came out with a whole new menu and it looked like things could be getting better. But nope. This place is so inconsistent with food prep, I can't even stand it! Drives me crazy! How difficult is it to make a salad or a grilled cheese? Apparently, it's a doozy of a job.  On a positive note, they do make an excellent chocolate chip cookie!"}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix over the weekend and spent a lot of time at a couple of Paradise Cafes. I mostly had coffee and used the free wi-fi. Great coffee, great atmosphere, a lot of people in the restaurant but not too noisy."}
{"text":"You got to love the Turkey Cranberry sandwhich and they tip it off with a cookie.   No compliants a great quick lunch."}
{"text":"Quick lunch so I had the Spinach power salad.  Pretty quick and easy.  Salad tasted pretty good.  Lots of people in there so it was pretty noisy."}
{"text":"We stopped for a little breakfast before our flight.  Staff was good except for a little explanation on a few items.  They were moving fast and getting the food out.  One order was for the potato soup which was delicious along with a very hard roll.  We were happy with the soup but not with the hard roll.  Another order was for the heated egg and ham sandwich.  Only half of it was eaten.  With all the butter running off of it, it was greasy.  The 3 star is for the staff and the potato soup."}
{"text":"I came here and had a breakfast sandwich, It was nothing to write home about, but did the trick."}
{"text":"This place seems way understaffed as it took about 30 minutes to order and get a sandwich here. The quality is fine but if you are in a rush, this is not the place to stop."}
{"text":"Slightly expensive. If you're going to get food, do it earlier in the day. We (us airport employees) have had stale baked goods before. The employees there are nice. Convenient location right after the security checkpoint. Overall it's ok in a pinch."}
{"text":"I love their salads and soups!   Yes, Paradise is known for their cookies.  I've actually bought over 20 boxes one time for an individual's birthday plus a big cookie.  The staff is really helpful and always friendly.  Personally,  I'm over the cookies and chips but the Chocolate Chip Banana muffin heated is so good anytime of the day!    I'm not a fan of their French Onion but I usually mix the Chicken and Wild Rice with the Broccoli and Cheese.  A cup is under $5 and it's pretty filling with the roll.  Their newest Spinach salad with bacon, mushrooms, and egg is very tasty -sweet mainly and filling.  Lunch time can be crazy busy with business professionals and tourists who cannot decide what to get.  Wi-Fi is free for two hours.   BEWARE: On Sundays, they do clean out the drains, talk about smelly!"}
{"text":"Used this location for a Quick bite to go, tried the online order/pay kiosk.  Reasonably easy to use for ordering, limited menu due to airport location. Long wait for pickup.  Lots of staff, some looked confused.  Panini was a hot mess, tasty but I needed a shower after eating, not so portable."}
{"text":"do not go here unless you want to be disappointed, the manager was unapologetic that she did not make the decision to have enough bagels prepared for what everyone in the world would know would be an extremely busy day..Easter Sunday..and you only have enough product to last until 8.30 AM?  tip: your piss poor planning should not become my problem PB&C have lost all of my business...."}
{"text":"I love Paradise Bakery and Cafes....but not this one. I fly to Phoenix pretty regularly and always fly United to I am in Terminal 2 a lot. Every time I have stopped here, the food has been very typical Paradise Bakery. The problem is that they seem to run out of things a lot and their customer service is horrible."}
{"text":"I don't eat meat so I ordered the quinoa Mediterranean salad. There was a pile of chicken and maybe a teaspoon of quinoa...maybe. And the blueberry superfood smoothie?! Ugh. Watery and tasteless.  Very unimpressed."}
{"text":"Reminded me a lot of Panera Bread, just not as good.   Ordered a pick 2 combo with a smoked turkey sandwich and a southwestern salad. I had to basically eat the sandwich as a salad, as the bread didn't even cover the half. I took one bite and it all fell apart.  My mom said the salad was pretty bland, and it was very, very small, even for a half size. It took her about 4 bites to finish it.   The line was long to order. Food came out quick though. It was very busy and very loud, and I think that the cashier couldn't do more than a whisper. We could barely hear her, and she looked like she was annoyed because of it. It wasn't our fault. Nobody had a smile on their face.   Would've gone somewhere else, but unfortunately it was the closest to my gate and my plane boarded soon."}
{"text":"The new menu at Paradise Bakery is horrible.   The food is tasteless and the staff on the weekend is slow and inexperienced.  I'll be surprise if this location is in business in the next 6 months.   Definitely do not go to this location any longer."}
{"text":"Paradise Bakery is what it is. Upscale cafe with overpriced yet quality food.  With that out of the way, let me say that the chicken salad sandwich here is beyond a doubt some of the best chicken salad I've ever had. If a restaurant has it on the menu I usually order chicken salad, so I've tried a lot of different kinds and this is one of my favorites. It's got walnuts and a great consistency with the chicken cut just right. It may sound silly, but a chicken salad sandwich with a complimentary cookie thrown in after a day at work is some pretty good comfort food."}
{"text":"Fresh delicious sandwich and very pleasant staff. Quick service for my to go order. My husband is a chocolate chip cookie connoisseur and he loves the cookie they include with each sandwich. Decent price too- $10 for sandwich, large drink and cookie. The turkey cranberry on molasses bread is the best!"}
{"text":"This is one of those places where I order the same thing every time just to be safe. So here is my thing:  Tuna sandwich with a SPECIAL REQUEST: mix in diced red onions and cucumber with the tuna. Add oatmeal cookie on the side.  The sandwich is pretty good for fast food. If I am looking for strictly a sandwich, I don't think there is a better place in Tempe Marketplace. It's a chain restaurant, so expect a similar experience to other Paradise's in the valley (the airport one is actually pretty cool though in its own way). Every meal comes with a chocolate chip cookie (I think), which is why I order an oatmeal cookie--I pay extra for the oatmeal cookie but they are in the habit of still including the free cookie so you guessed it--FREE COOKIE SOMETIMES!"}
{"text":"I like this place, salads great and love the walnut chicken on that yummy brown bread and the cookies. the orange ones called lemon zester, those are fabulous!"}
{"text":"Great oatmeal chocolate chip cookies. And good smoothies.  A bit pricy. But well worth it"}
{"text":"Snotty little teenagers with attitudes.  I have been coming to Paradise Cafe all over the valley for 9 years since i moved here. I fell in love with their salads and infamous cookies. My friend and I went to a movie in Tempe Marketplace and craved something sweet so we walked over to grab a couple of cookies. Every time I have gone to a Paradise Cafe and asked for a cookie they offer me another one for free. When we asked for 2 cookies, the girl with a pissy attitude scolded me and said in her annoying valley girl voice, 'That's ONLY when  you buy a meal.\" I was completely caught off guard by this information and the way she approached it. And then she just stared at me. A stare like... \"Do you want fries with that?\" or \"Ugh my life is so hard! I hate being a teenager!\"  Management.. if you're going to hire teenagers surely you can be more picky. There are teenagers out there who aren't little brats that need to be slapped across the face.  Awful customer service, always crowded... and your cookies are always hard and not fresh, whether in the day or at night.  I went back to my usual location on Mcclintock and Guadalupe and asked for a buy one, get one free cookie (no meal purchased) and they gave it to me without questions asked. I asked him about this and he said yes that's technically what they were told but everyone does it out of customer satisfaction.  And it worked."}
{"text":"The service was really poor and the manager was extremely rude.  I went with a friend and she and I ordered at exactly the same time.  My friends meal can out but not mine.  The server stated they would check to see where my meal was. They never came back.  About 5 minutes later the manager stopped by our table to see how our food was.  When we told him I still had not received my meal he said he would go check.  Never came back to advise.  When my friend was 10 minutes into her meal she went to find the manager and was advised it would be out shortly.  Waited about 3 more minutes and the manager finally brought out my meal. No apology just a rude comment saying well it was only 8 minutes.  Will never go there again."}
{"text":"Average chain location with AIRPORT pricing. ;O)"}
{"text":"Kind of a small floorplan and can get very crowded. People hovering over you waiting for a vacant table. Not my idea of an enjoyable environment. Food is OK and restaurant was clean. Staff was friendly and helpful. Just need a bigger space."}
{"text":"The food was surprisingly good but the service left a lot to be desired.  It took 20 minutes to get my order- turns out they just forgot about it, even though I asked about it multiple times. They did offer me a drink and extra cookie for the wait, so plus one star for that. I understand that mistakes happen but the vibe of this place makes me think they happen pretty often here.   The food itself was better than I had expected, and reasonably priced for an airport. Tasty and reasonably healthy, with lots of prominently featured vegetarian options."}
{"text":"We come to this location often because it's closes to our house but today we have dealt with enough of your horrible costumer service. The little girl with long black hair which wasn't even put up or anything under her hat took our order and was ruder than ever to us she didn't speak or look at us and when we asked her questions she stared blankly at us and also if you're switching your menu please change it. The sandwich I ordered was a ham and Swiss with the sauce on sourdough pressed and I received a wheat bread dry with a slice of ham and half a slice of cheese. I asked them about it and both of the sandwich makers were super rude. They told me they had the stuff to make it but didn't make it the way I asked because it didn't come that way. ? And also Chris on salad make a Caesar for my boyfriend when he asked for a south west Caesar and I went back before we even paid and asked him if he could make us the south west like we had asked and he rolled his eyes and me and when he was finished with the salad his response back to me was here's the SOUTHWEST Caesar. Like I know what I ordered and please don't give me attitude when you messed up, and I understand it could have been very common to mistake the Caesars but don't give the guest attitude back. Horrible horrible costumer service. The older gentlemen on cash and Erick the busser were the only nice faces we experienced today.  Sad to say we have to find a new location with friendlier staff to go to."}
{"text":"Arrived at Sky Harbor Aron's 6 pm, so close to end of day for this airport. Staff was rude and unfriendly. They seemed to be bothered that I was there and I was the only customer btw. After my cold interaction, I walked to a place to eat and when I opened my sandwich it was not what I ordered. Will not go there again. A nicer place is more near the gates. Don't go here."}
{"text":"My husband and I come here a lot and the last few times have been terrible. While we were in line a woman was yelling at them about the coffee they never brought her and when we ordered our take out they forgot my 3 year olds macaroni and cheese meal out of all the meals they forget the toddler meal and when my husband called to inform them they denied denied denied. Terrible service"}
{"text":"Food good for chain. Customer service at this location indifferent, poor and slow.   There was just us and one other. Fulfillment of order good, check out process extremely slow."}
{"text":"This is really a chain restaurant that relies on marketing, because if they had to stand on their food they would be closed by now. If you read the menu, you think there is something amazing awaiting you. When the food actually arrives, it truly disappoints. Take the walnut chicken salad sandwich on molasses bread. My first thought is of big chunks of white chicken breast, celery, walnuts, maybe apple, a light toss with may and heaped onto a dense, sweet, dark wheat bread that has the molasses taste hitting every note when you bite into the savory chicken salad. What you get is a bland drippy mess.  The turkey cranberry makes me think of a Thanksgiving menu, then you get it and think if the Pilgrims were served this, they would have packed up the Mayflower and left.  The rest of the menu is basic Panera Bread. Which means its bad food under any name. Unfortunately, there are not many Corner Bakeries in AZ, so if you are here, you are stuck with Paradise, and it aint no paradise."}
{"text":"This is one of the few \"affordable\" lunch options in the biltmore, which is why I have given to so many chances.   They get my order right I would say probably one out of every five times. The other four times they kind of just make whatever it is they feel like making with absolutely no regard for your actual order. This is also the slowest location I have ever been to. They take an average of 15 minutes to get the order to you if you have ordered something hot. And then after all that time your order is wrong. But with the lunch timer ticking down there isn't anytime for them to slowly construct the \"correct\" order.   Coming here is basically like playing a game. What will I get from paradise this time? And how far off from what I actually ordered will it be?"}
{"text":"Great food all the time - service is pretty decent as well."}
{"text":"Really BAD service----to the owner you should look up the manager on duty, April 12th 11:00 a.m.----waited for 15 minutes for our order--at our he counter. Finally asked (very nicely), manager threw it at my husband and said they called his name.  Not true----issues here! Don't stop not with the stress. Rather eat plane food!"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in the cleanliness of this restaurant.  There was not one clean table in sight, no paper towels in the ladies room and no napkins in the restaurant.  The ladies room needed attention.  The floor was very dirty.  The lady in front of me asked for some napkins and the cashier told her it would be a few minutes.  I am baffled as to why she could not hand her some immediately.  If a restaurant is this neglected you worry about cleanliness in the food preparation area.  This location is always busy and it would seem successful enough to bring on extra staff as needed to maintain standards."}
{"text":"I want to review the food I ate here, but I can't because I didnt actually get to eat.  I had 15 minutes before work to grab something. The line wasn't too long so I didn't think anything of it.  Except there was only one cashier ringing people and taking orders. She chit-chatted with the man in front of me for so long that I ran out of time and had to leave empty handed. I tried to make eye contact with her to let her see my distress but she was too engrossed to notice.  I will not fault her for being polite with a regular guest or whoever he was but this is the morning rush hour. You can't take that much time on each patron when people have such limited time.   Annoying."}
{"text":"Vera was fantastic and very helpful. She had great recommendations and was patient in helping me with dietary needs. Food tasted good! The girl who brought our food took our buzzer away after delivering only 2/3 of our food, and we had to track her down to settle the confusion, but otherwise a very nice experience"}
{"text":"I love it here. Took my family here from Cali and they were impressed. They serve sandwiches, soups, and salads. There is a little coffee bar with pastries. The cookies here are fantastic. My boyfriend can't get enough of the chocolate chip cookies! I have never been disappointed with the food and would recommend it to anyone who likes soups, salads, and sandwiches! Only complaint is that I wish they were open later. =P"}
{"text":"Absolutely the crappiest Original Cheese sandwich ever. Had it done twice. Only One side barely warmed each time, instead of Grilled. Not fit for Third World Consumption. Really. It was that horrible."}
{"text":"In any other setting, this would be a 3 star review but for airport food Paradise does a fine job. I'm pretty sure they are part of the Panera chain as the menus share many of the same items.   My turkey-cranberry panini was good enough but light on actual turkey. It was a big ass sandwich though, and one could easily be split between two people. There are healthy options - wraps, salads and the like. Every sandwich comes with a free cookie which is pretty great. Employees at this location are pleasant but the seating area is postage stamp sized and way overcrowded.   You don't have a lot of choices in this concourse, but still - Paradise isn't bad."}
{"text":"OVERATED! Not impressive in the least bit. Nothing special, not fresh and the service was sub par. Wildflower is far superior."}
{"text":"I'll keep it quick, you forgot some of our food. My grilled cheese sandwich looks terrible, is it really that hard to make a grilled cheese? Come on guys you're located in the Biltmore. This is embarrassing."}
{"text":"Never eaten here but i Love the cookies! Try the citrus ones. Orange color,(odd) as they taste lemony. YUM! Also good are their Snickerdoodles!"}
{"text":"I just can't get enough of this place. I know they are all around the valley and the food is not amazing, but I just can't help but come back almost every weekend!  This is a perfect place for students/teachers who need to devote a whole day to study or do work without worrying about leaving to eat. They have great salads and amazing soups, but by far the BEST COOKIES EVER!! I think I have tried almost every single one, but my favorite are still the chocolate chip coconut. Delicious! Try the Southwest Ceasar salad. It's pretty darn good too."}
{"text":"Exactly like a panera minus the awesome green tea.  Their sandwiches are good, so are their soups, but I never feel like anything is fresh.  I know their soups come frozen and they just heat it.  Still satisfies when you need to drop in for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"This location, much like Tatum & Shea, is laughable!  I called tonight at 847 to place an order as I was driving there.  I was informed by the person who was having difficulty taking my order that the store closed at 9p and the cash register was already closed.  I said how can the cash registered be closed if the store is not closed yet?  She said \"well you only have 5 mins to get here.\"  I said \" I will be there.  It has taken more time to try and place the order\".  Then a manager gets on the phone and tells me the same thing.  It was as if they were trying to talk me out of coming and themselves out of business.  What do they care?  They are just hourly workers hoping to get off work asap. We walk in the OPEN unlocked door at 855 and none of our food is ready.  It was a joke, unprofessional."}
{"text":"This is my 4th visit to the location. Each and every single time has been a fiasco. Tonight I called in my order to go to help avoid the Friday night rush. They were out of flatbreads so I could not have the sandwich I wanted. I then chose the turkey cranberry on molasses bread and a small salad, no tomatoes. When I arrive I am advised they are out of molasses bread, so again I don't get the sandwich I want. Grabbed a snicker doodle cookie to go. Upon getting home with our order, the salad had tomatoes and the cookie was barely cooked. $25 for two people, no drinks. This will be my LAST visit! The management obviously doesn't manage very well for the restaurant to consistently offer below par service and quality. Get it together!"}
{"text":"V"}
{"text":"Open 24 hrs, today at least :) Prices are more than fair & drinks, food, &desserts are delicious :) employees are kind & quick :)"}
{"text":"My experience.  MY experience was 5 stars.  The gal at the register was super friendly and super helpful.  The food was actually reasonably priced too.  I got an avocado egg and spinach sandwich.  The gal at the register let me switch out the egg white for whole egg with no problem.  She also hooked me up with some carbonated water with lemon as well.  Now don't get me wrong.  It's not a place you need to buy a plane ticket, get frisked and stand in line for an hour behind a crying baby just to try it.  But it's definitely not a place to walk away from if they have something on the menu that looks good.  Yep.  My experience says 5 stars."}
{"text":"Good service, good food. Love the soups, can't speak to anything else. Can get loud and slow service at lunch, but worth the wait. Free Wi-Fi, consistency with food, OK prices."}
{"text":"Never understand people who come to paradise on a regular basis just to eat. It's like overpriced cafeteria food... For real. But I come here once and a while and found out Students get 10% off if you choose not to use your rewards card. Also, the cookies are still amazing and the employees seem much older and much kinder than other locations."}
{"text":"Stumbled into this place while vacationing in Scottsdale for Spring Training. I was suffering from one of those hangovers that makes you feel your pulse in your dome. My buddy(who was campaigning for breakfast at Taco Bell..who does that?) was driving like a kamikaze pilot and responded to the vehicle full of people pointing towards Paradise and grunting uggghhh. While walking up to the door an odd brown dribble stain was pointing us towards the entrance. Didn't know what to make of this. Also wasn't sure if it was from my friends who had plodded in ahead of me. Once entering this fine establishment my not-so-working-correct brain couldn't comprehend the two different counters. Also confusing was the two menus. Being told what was going on by a nice gal behind the counter didn't help much since English was definitely my second language at this point in time. After just pointing at what I needed I was ushered along to the cash register. I got my number sat with my group and waited.....and waited......and waited. As more time passed I began to ponder what the actual construction and building time for a croissant sandwich was. Also helping was my wife reminding me of every person that got there food ahead of me. We were asked how are food was a couple of times so I figure they could sense my frustration as to not having it. Then my glorious croissant sandwich was brought to me. It tasted absolutely magnificent. I could have died right then and been happy. To make up for this delay the manager brought us THREE boxes of cookies. I didn't catch her name, but damn if she didn't pass customer relations 101. Tossing me a free OJ would've been sufficient, but to give this wild pack of drunken animals munchies for the weekend went above and beyond. I will definitely crawl back in the next time I visit Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Good eats.    It's in Terminal 4 BEFORE you get to security, so everyone can enjoy the meal and/or snack.    We ordered a chicken caesar salad, a southwestern caesar salad, a pumpkin muffin, and a small diet Coke for $21.35.  There was a decent amount of chicken in both the caesars.  The southwestern one featured tortilla strips instead of croutons, and a chipotle dressing instead of the usual caesar dressing.  Banquettes along one wall gave us plenty of room to sprawl, so we didn't have to rush to our gate and wait there for two hours."}
{"text":"I very rarely am disappointed by the food however often times when I come in the service is a little slow and typically speaking I see the employees bickering behind the counter in front of customers which in my opinion is not very professional. My last visit to the store manager was yelling at one of the employees right in front of customers which I felt was extremely degrading and not appropriate. Where I'm from California this place has a different name, most of the food is the same and pretty good. Look to spend a little bit more than you typically would for most quick eateries for lunch but it's definitely worth it for fresh meal. Little work on organization and process and how to display some professionalism in front of customers in this place will gain it's five stars versus the three that I'm giving today."}
{"text":"Located on the Southeast corner of 67th Ave and the 101, in the 99 Cent store shopping center, next to Burger King.  I have been to this location several times, the parking is terrible!  The lines are usually long, esp at lunchtime. If it's a non-peak time (like after the lunch rush in the middle of the afternoon), the service is slow like molasses.  There are sort of two lines. One is for food (fancy sandwiches and various salads) and the other is a cookie or coffee ONLY line. Grab some free bite-size cookie samples while you wait in line.  The food is kinda pricey for the portions you get. Maybe it's just the hype of this place that keep it so busy. Clean restrooms."}
{"text":"You make my delays bareable!! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"I was traveling at 6pm on Mothers Day with my 3 children and was amazed at the gangster style attitude of the staff.  These girls were maybe 18 years old and the opposite of service oriented or friendly.  They were saying rude things to me as I walked away like \" I told you you needed a bag\", \"you can throw your bag away\", \"oh, now you want a bag?!\"  The one star is very generous as I've never experienced being treated like this and on top of it on Mother's Day!  I was simply trying to avoid using a bag as we were eating there.  Management should try to either offer higher pay to attract kids who want to earn their pay or consider training better."}
{"text":"To be fair, this particular review is specifically about their grilled cheese sandwich. First of all, apparently if you don't specify,  they use American cheese... strike one. Secondly, they only grill it on one side, cutting it in half and folding it so that the ungrilled portion is \"hidden\" on the inside. The moisture from the two warmed slices then made those pieces not grilled, but steamed (yuck). My third, and final complaint is that they did not put butter on the bread before grilling it resulting in a final product that was relatively tasteless and soggy/crunchy. Maybe I'm just spoiled....  The cookie that came with it was good."}
{"text":"This is a Panera! Very confused when I saw in the gps a Panera was close but couldn't find it in the shopping center. I thought it was very clean in there and very large!! Lots of tables if you do want to hang out. I ordered a choc chip began toasted with butter and Carmel late. I was happy with my bagel but not the late... it was super foamy and milky, did not taste the Carmel till the last sip."}
{"text":"Great coffee. Free refills just keep your receipt. Hazelnut coffee?! with more hazelnut? I'm in heaven. I also got bottom of the pot coffee and my mouth is tingling from the caffeine. LOL. The bagels here are also worth the price."}
{"text":"Amazing chicken avocado Cobb salad .. I would recommend this place to my friends and family ! Also they have the best chocolate chip cookies !"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick take out lunch. Ordered the chicken and quinoa salad. The service was quick and friendly and the location was very welcoming and clean. My 3 star rating comes from the portion size and price in relation to said portion size. Now I did order a half salad and I paid over $7. SO not worth it. There were 3 small slices of chicken, a spoonful of quinoa at best and 2 olives. That added to a fistful of lettuce and that was it. Nothing more. Portion size was ridiculous for the price. Food was tasty but I will definite not be back."}
{"text":"I just love this place. It is always clean, There is this bus boy Chris that is amazing and does such a good job. He is a hard worker. He always smiles and greets people. He is always hustling cleaning off tables. Such a nice boy. The food is always fresh and amazing, the cookies THE BEST!!! This is the only Paradise Bakery I like to go to."}
{"text":"I just got the ham, egg and cheese breakfast sandwich. And while it looked very underwhelming it was excellent. Staff was very friendly -- especially for 6am."}
{"text":"Not impressed... The staff was not very courteous. I ordered a turkey sandwich with lettuce, tomato, provolone, mayo and mustard... Ended up with a Turkey, Bacon and Cheddar Panini. Swing and a miss... Nice try. It's a good thing I asked for the extras like mayo and mustard, because they aren't going to tell you what comes on it unless you ask. The salad didn't seem to offer up a lot of vegetable options, mostly different lettuces and lots of dressing, bacon, cheeses and such.  The bread was soft and cookie was nice... Not really worth the money though."}
{"text":"Paradise Bakery in Terminal 4 C concourse is. The worst. I'm a big fan of Paradise, but this location is terrible. There's a line out the door and most of the employees are standing around. The manager on duty at 6pm on a Tuesday evening is rude and threw her employee under the bus, \"she's new\" instead of taking responsibility for being out of ingredients. I fly out of Skyharbor every week and I won't be to this location again."}
{"text":"I go there and work at least 4 times a week. Laptop friendly, but wish they had more outlets to plug into. Food is a little pricey for a sandwich, but that's okay. Right across from my fitness club, so very convenient."}
{"text":"I've been to this location many times and every time the ordering process is RIDICULOUS. You approach the window and order and they usually direct you to \"soup person\" and then then the \"salad person\" - it's quite chaotic to place an order, and you're shuffled around a bunch. By the time you get to the cash register, the person working does not know what you've ordered - you end up repeating your request several times.  I also find it very odd the way they literally hand you your food after its prepared, mid process. They don't set anything on a tray with silverware or on a plate. They just hand you the soup bowl and then hand you the bread - imagine shopping at a grocery store without a cart.  I go here because I'm a fan of Panera (they own Paradise Bakery) and because the food is the same (except the average cookies here) but the ordering system here makes for a lengthy and confusing experience."}
{"text":"I used their catering service for the first time and was 100% impressed with everything.  Tami took my order and everything was received perfectly and on time... they even put each sandwich in bag with each individuals name on it... very professional.  I'll keep on using Paradise Bakery in the future."}
{"text":"Once upon a time this was a  regular lunch stop.. I would have given it 4 1/2 stars then..   But.. Then this visit..  When I sat down and took the first bite of my salad I looked at my best-friend and said \"umm what is this?\"   Yuck! It was bad..   She got the soup which was very bland and tasteless.   I will go back and do try again, I once loved this place maybe it was a off day!"}
{"text":"Spacious place which is very accomodating to people working alone or in the group.  I feel comfortable coming alone and just reading paper.  Love the Choose 2. Such great deal and choices.  Plus, you can even customize what they have on the menu.  I am always trying to watch my weight so it is awesome that I can fill up on a turkey sandwich and greek salad for such little calories, high protein and low cost. Plus, its way better tasting than fast food!!   What is not there to love!!  Thank you for taking over the old Fuddruckers. You are becoming my 2nd home. :)"}
{"text":"I was here for 4 days with my hasnand and each day we could not wait to go and have breakfast here.  He had the jalapeño chedder bagel and I had the asiago bagel breakfast sandwich.   Both were supper yummy.   The only thing he mentioned is that it was only a hint of jalapeño  and he wished for actual jalapeños.   Coffee is great and they state when it was brewed.  The last day I went healthy and had there oatmeal.  Yummy.   It had strawberries and pecans.   I feel ready to take on the day.   Angela came by to check on us and was great to tell us a little about the place.  I have left the best for last.   The have the absolutely best cookies.  So moist and perfect flavor.  I hope you try this place out and have the same great experience."}
{"text":"$11 for half a boring sandwich and a flavorless salad?! Paradise doesn't hold a candle compared to Wildflower.  The service was fine, but the food was SO average that I can't justify spending that much for what I got again."}
{"text":"Came here in search of a healthy lunch while visiting Phoenix and was not disappointed. I had the signature Fuji apple salad with grilled chicken. It was a generous size (ordered the large); everything was fresh and I loved the house dressing.   The Asian chicken wrap is also very good. I would love it if they offered whole wheat and brown rice as alternatives to the standard refined carb version.   Each order comes with a complimentary fresh baked chocolate chip cookie, yummy! The zucchini muffins are also delicious. Prices are reasonable.   Do not drink the coffee! It sucks. I've had better coffee at IHOP. Not only does it taste like dish water but it also gave both myself and the other person who had it the runs."}
{"text":"This place offers cheap, good eats that are pretty much non-existent at the vast majority of US airports. The veggie sandwich and Thai chicken wrap were both quite good, although the Thai chicken wrap did taste more Chinese than Thai. Each only set us back $6 or so. Service was very friendly. The only thing we didn't enjoy was the supposedly infamous cookies - they were so sweet they left my mouth filled with little sores. Not a great way to end an otherwise very satisfying airport meal."}
{"text":"Can't but cookies? Ordered salad paid try to add some cookies to the order. Told I had to go to the back of the line? Terrible service. .won't be back"}
{"text":"Paradise bakery has some delicious food .. It is a little on the expensive side but I feel the quality is more than worth it. I've found that often the employees can be sort of rude and generally don't seem to be too happy working there. It is busy, though, so maybe they're just trying to get to everyone. With that being said, i would pretty much choose this place over subway or jimmy johns just for the quality alone."}
{"text":"I just moved here from California and although I have seen Paradise Bakeries in the past I have never eaten at one. I have eaten at Panera Bread quite frequently. So when I looked at the menu I saw that they were similar so went inside. First, on the positive, the line went very quickly and my cashier was very friendly and helpful. He also gladly answered the questions I had regarding Paradise Bakery and Panera Bread, even though I'm sure he gets asked them often. I would mention him by name, but he didn't have a nametag and the receipt said \"Lori\" which I'm pretty sure wasn't his name, but if it is, Lori was wonderful.  So Paradise Bakery and Panera Bread are not really the same. Paradise Bakery has no Rewards program, there wasn't \"would you like to buy a bakery item for 99 cents?\", there was no choice of sides (baguette, chips, or apple), which is no problem as I always get the baguette, but I was served a dinner roll.  Just not the same.  The other differences were they don't bring your order to you, they instead call your name to come pick it up.  This particular location is very cramped, mostly 2 person chairs with two family style booths. I didn't see plug ins and when I went to sign up for wifi, it said Panera Bread. Hmmmm....  Maybe I'm just being nostalgic for the way my old stomping grounds were...   I did read other reviews and they spoke of free chocolate chip cookies, but I was not offered one. All-in-all about middle of the road for me"}
{"text":"TERMINAL 2-SKY HARBOR-Paradise Bakery is NOT in hurry to get passengers to their gates on time.  Disorganized staff and systems..."}
{"text":"I waited the longest I have ever waited for one sandwich . When I asked why it was taking so long a  Very rude gal with s major attitude  informed by me they only had one person making sandwiches  . Really ? So I guess the other 4 people standing around doing nothing are incapable . To make matters worse I ended up throwing the worst tuna panini in the trash ! It was disgusting slimy cat food ."}
{"text":"So disappointed;  the flow is disconnected and my tomato mozzarella Flatbread was so hard the bread was like a cardboard box. The remade Flatbread wasn't much better. No one asks what cookie you want and automatically brought chocolate chip but I can't have chocolate.  Just heard another customer say they won't be back to Paradise anymore.  Neither will I. Panera is MUCH better hands down! !!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love their chia tea latte and their avocado turkey sandwich with a southwest salad it's super yummy and feels you up without giving that (over ate feeling)"}
{"text":"Not exactly my idea of Paradise.*  My small BBQ Chop Salad had piles of inedibly salty chicken ($4.50).  I picked out the romaine lettuce, corn kernels, and diced tomatoes.  J's California Turkey Sandwich with turkey, bacon, lettuce, cucumbers, and veggie spread was better ($7.50).  However, the best part of his sandwich was the fact that it came with a chocolate chip cookie.  That's what I get for trying to be healthy!    *Well maybe in the purgatory of airport food it is?  6/2012"}
{"text":"A great office away from home. They cater to the impromptu meetings crowd. Decent values on food that's better than typical chain fare."}
{"text":"Options in Terminal 3 are limited, but skip this one. Service was super slow and not very friendly. I ordered the chipotle bacon chicken sandwich & it wasn't very good. The chocolate chip cookie was pretty tasty"}
{"text":"IF you can get in here you will love it! Be warned the Breakfast and Lunch rush can get mobbed. They offer a lot of different options and all that I have tried are excellent."}
{"text":"I love their southwestern chicken ceasar salad! I visited recently thought and ordered a snicker doodle and a hot chocolate. $6 Yes, 1 cookie and 1 hot chocolate $6  Why is that so upsetting? They make it in front of you. And let me tell you how. They get a cup. They put hot water in it They open a packet of carnation hot chocolate and mix it in the water. They put the lid on and give it to me. Yes really.  Plus, the drink was SO hot that my hand was burning through the cup sleeve AND the lid started melting.  I went to Starbucks and we had a good laugh at their expense."}
{"text":"fresh baked goods and nice place to hang out before a flight."}
{"text":"Won't ever come back here again! I came in and was waiting in line to order a sandwich and was shocked to realize the people in front of me were actually his friends. Finally he took my order (very rudely like i totally bothered him) 2-3 minutes later and as I left he went back to talking to them instead of making my damn sandwich. No excuses for such poor service. Oh and by the way the sandwich sucked and was burned."}
{"text":"Headed to Paradise for lunch today after recommending it to my co-worker.   The food, like at most other Paradise locations, is acceptable. A little on the pricey side, but okay.  This location was originally slated for a Panera Bread store until Paradise finally relented and Panera bought them out. I've heard Paradise is pretty popular with the locals, but being from the Midwest I prefer Panera. Their breads and bagels are sooooo much better.   As a side note, if the three mothers with three babies read this review, the next time you are out PLEASE pay attention to your children. If your babies are screaching it probably means they want or need something. If they don't pay some attention to them so they don't continue to scream and disrupt everyone else's lunch. GEEZ"}
{"text":"The food is great here but it's so over priced. I purchased an Asian sesame chicken salad, a zucchini muffin and two chocolate chip cookies and I walked out 12 dollars and some change lighter. This is the reason I don't frequent Paradise often but it's payday so it's my treat."}
{"text":"I used to come here for lunch during work hours, but I refuse to eat here ever again. The staff is rude, they have no customer service ability. They just let you stand there and never ask to take your order or when you ask a question they act like they don't want to answer. The food is also not very good and they skimp ALOT. I have also found they run out of things very often and don't really care if they don't have what you want. Overall don't eat here, there's plenty of other options in the area. Maybe the management should take a hard look at how they are serving customers."}
{"text":"Just wanted to grab a muffin before my morning flight. There were a lot of yummy-looking choices: lemon poppy seed, zucchini nut, cranberry orange, banana chocolate chip, and others, but I went with a traditional blueberry muffin. I felt bad for having to use my card for $2+ but I didn't have cash. I guess I could've gotten more muffins, but it wasn't a big deal. Enjoyed the muffin; it was good."}
{"text":"Okay. So, you're stuck in the airport. Your flight has been delayed... again. You skipped breakfast because you thought you'd make it to your destination on time for an early lunch. Wrong. As your blood sugar is dropping, you drag your bag down the hallway and across the platform to where food can be located.   Paradise Bakery quickly presents itself as an option. Fresh soups, salads, sandwiches, and macaroni and cheese. Kind of like a Panera? Staff was friendly and helpful. I tried the August Squash soup and Mediterranean Vegetable Sandwich 1/2 and 1/2 combo. They put onions on the sandwich even though I asked for none, oh well. The soup was actually pretty darn good, FYI. Not sure if all of the soups are that good, but this one sure was. Sandwich was a bit soggy. Like they didn't drain the vegetables enough.   By the time I had finished my lunch, the lady across the way was staring at me. She was either incredibly jealous of my airport lunch, or was judging me for the disastrous mess I was making in trying to eat it.   There was also a bonus chocolate chip cookie. It reminded me of when my mom used to make my lunches. It was a nice little surprise that made my layover that much better. It's still airport food, but it was exactly what I needed. I had a smoothie from this place the last time I was at the airport, and that was pretty good from what I remember. Thanks for being there when I need to recharge."}
{"text":"The staff is nice.  The seating is fine.  The soundtrack is above average.  It is close to work.  Unfortunately they cap their internet, lack Equal, and.....well.....it's not Wildflower."}
{"text":"One of the more spacious and industrial Paradise Bakery locations, and another one that does not provide Equal Sweetener.  Not nearly as loud as other spots, particularly during the weekend morning rush, but unfortunately the noise comes in the form of Country Western music.  :-("}
{"text":"More of the same.  Coffee is decent, Wi-Fi is limited during peak hours, and the place is jammed packed most of the day.  This city needs more Wildflower."}
{"text":"The food is OK-but overpriced... the cookies are fresh, however... they cannot figure out how to take phone orders! I called at 1:40 and ordered 1 Italian sub. I arrived at 2:00 and paid for my order, and watched about 15 people move through the food line. Finally the man at the register (noticing me standing around) went to the food line and reminded them I was still waiting. I finally got my sub and left at 2:15. This is not the first time something like this has happened here either. Several times I've tried to order a simple breakfast bagel sandwich to pick up on my way to the office. Like many other reviews state: it's usually wrong  Won't be back!"}
{"text":"Terminal 2 @ PHX...it was lunchtime and we'd just come through security.  Decided to get lunch and did a \"pick 2\".  Seriously good food, especially for airport food.  We got 2 - 1/2 sandwiches...2 1/2 salads...it came with a cookie for dessert and it was under $16.  I often wonder who the people are that give such bad reviews...or maybe I'm just too easy to please?  I don't think so."}
{"text":"The owners of Paradise Bakery need to take a close look at this one. It's in an airport and it's just inside security. I wanted an iced tea. For a restaurant chain that does this pretty well at their other stores, with brewed tea ready, I thought it was a no-brainer. Yikes, was I wrong?  First, to get the one person to ring me up and get a cup was a challenge. It took way longer than it should have. They don't care. Then, when I asked for a lemon for my tea I was informed the lemons are only for salads. HUH? Such crap. Make a customer happy and give her a freaking lemon. Power trip.  Then I took a sip of my tea and promptly dropped it in the nearest trash can. I want my $2.50 back.  Paradise Bakery owners - get this location straightened out. It gives you a bad name."}
{"text":"Great food! Lackluster service  get the club sammie, its really good  they give you cookie with every order too"}
{"text":"(1.50 stars)  When I'm about to board a 5 hour flight, I stuff a sandwich and soda bottle into my messenger bag for later consumption.  The expectation is about as basic as I'm ever going to have regarding food.  Paradise Bakery, which apparently is a very well-regarded local chain, really needs to assess how to translate their successes into an airport setting.  Although she appeared to be very bored, the young lady at the counter was friendly-- no attitude problem.  I wanted mayo instead of their \"Paradise Sauce,\" and she delivered here, as well.  The sandwich was reasonably thick with meat, greens and tomatoes.  Bread, which was understood to be their strong suit, was over-sized and a bit stale; perhaps I waited too long to eat it.  There were no bottles of unsugared soda, but water was fine.  Where did things go wrong?  First, there wasn't enough paper used to wrap the sandwich and keep it intact; how expensive would 3\" of additional paper on a $7.50 sandwich have been?  Next, no napkins were packed; this should be an automatic at airport carryout.  Third, for some reason, a chocolate chip cookie was thrown into the bag.  For reasons which will be clear in a moment, it was very broken (but very tasty) when I found it.  Finally, although I specifically asked for a cheap plastic bag, I was given a froufrou paper mini shopping bag with an \"adorable\" paper handle.  I don't need to impress my fellow passengers with my good taste in shopping bags, I needed something which will neatly compress to be stowed.  If you have ever tried to reassemble a sandwich while in the middle seat of an airplane, you get the picture.  The end-product was adequate, with mayo and tomato covered hands as an added bonus.  Once again life teaches me that lowering your standards just a little ultimately means that reasonable expectations become unrealistic."}
{"text":"Panera ruined this place. The menu used to be amazing, the food used to be fresh, the atmosphere used to be joyful. Now nobody is here and I know why. It's a shame that it's still called \"Paradise Bakery\" it's the furthest thing from the old paradise it used to be. I'm ashamed of the person who sold out what used to be an excellent restaurant."}
{"text":"So  we headed to Arrowhead before the rain tolls in Sunday amd decided on diner at Paradise Bakery.  1. Got to Ordering counter and saw noone as we stood as the young minions were doing Minions things out of sight.  They flood in unorganized and taking orders out of order.   2. THEY take our salad order then take sandwich order. We notice she made my wife's salas with a non chelant care for the inquiry for Sunflower seeds.  Prepared my son's salad and deopped 1/3 of his bagged Chicken.  Proceeded to ignore that same fact and then cop an attitude when we ask if she was going to replace the Chicken.   3. As if we were inconvenience them any more asking if we get a cookie with sandwich. Met with silence and then they are served  when sandwiches come out   Over all sad compared to 11th Street  & Glendale.   Will not be returning"}
{"text":"It's not five stars outside the airport, but is five stars in the airport where good quality food at a reasonable price is a rarity.  the cookies either have crack or meth in them - absurdly addictive - sandwiches are good."}
{"text":"I can't believe they really get away with serving garbage like this. Had a 1/2 sandwich bread was so hard and old threw half away couldn't bite through the cookies I got were tattles and hard as a rock the only redeeming part was the bag on potato chips all for only $12.50. What a disgrace I realize it's an airport by now most major airports have good fresh edible food. Phoenix airport management needs to get a grip on reality and update their airport to today's standards."}
{"text":"The Paradise Bakery and Cafe that I visited was located in Terminal 4.  There did not seem to be many food options with good sandwiches so I opted for Paradise Bakery and Cafe.  I did not realize that the wait time for my sandwich would be 15-20 minutes. The staff should really provide a quote time of how long it would take to prepare the food since 20 minutes can make all the difference in catching your flight or missing it.  I ordered the chipotle chicken sandwich. The lady was nice and checked to see if they had the sandwich available. I\"m not sure why they wouldn't have it available since it was a sandwich listed on the menu and it was 730am in the morning.  Thankfully they did have the sandwich.  After 20 minutes, I finally got my sandwich which came in a box.  To my surprise they also included a chocolate chip cookie which tasted DELICIOUS!!!!! One of the best cookies I've had ever! If I had known their cookies were so good I would have ordered a dozen of them to take home. But I didnt want to wait another 20 minutes to get cookies so I'll have to order it the next time I'm in Phoenix. The sandwich tasted OK."}
{"text":"Everytime I come to this place I ask myself why I don't come more often...  This is the definition of a lunch spot- they have soups, salads and hot/cold sandwiches- so if youre having trouble picking what you want- they have a pick 2 option that can save the day.  The service is good and works hard to keep the lines moving because when I'm in here they are in an extreme lunch rush.   To cap it off at the end of a good meal you can indulge in a freshly baked cookie of your choice- so make sure to save room.  Paradise Bakery is a winner!"}
{"text":"Came here for bfast because we were staying across the street. Ordered their Mediterranean Egg White sandwich and was not disappointed. Also got the blueberry muffin which was soso."}
{"text":"Good food as always, love the broccoli cheddar soup. Always the same Quality No matter which one you go to"}
{"text":"I had a 2 hour layover in the Phoenix airport and I was really hungry.  I ordered the classic grilled cheese sandwich which consisted of two pieces of toasted bread and cheese that had been melted in the microwave.  Yuck!!  I've never done this before but I asked one of the people working there if I could exchange my sandwich for another item that was the same price.  The girl was very accommodating, so I ordered the spinach salad without bacon.  Although the salad was better than the \"grilled cheese\" it wasnt good.  I was embarassed to return the salad, so I threw it away.  I can't remember the last time if ever I have not been able to eat food I've ordered out because it was so bad.  I gave Paradise one star because the chocolate chip cookie was delicious and the girl who worked there was nice about exchanging my food. Needless to say I will not be back!"}
{"text":"Best recommendation from someone I met on a flight.  Thanks Mariko! And now on top of that, they opened a location on the terminal side.  So if you are just transiting through, you can still enjoy a great sandwich and some awesome cookies!"}
{"text":"Asiago steak sandwich was a less delicious version of of the same sandwich at Panera Bread. Chocolate chip cookie was excellent. Banana chocolate chip muffin was good too."}
{"text":"Pathetic. From the help to the food to the cost. Pathetic. Sandwich tastes like a vending machine sandwich. Salad was not any better. $15 for a little half sandwich and a big Mac box of salad. The help barely capable of checking the boxes for your order. Sadly the only choice on the other side of security."}
{"text":"I used to like this location a lot until I came here for lunch today. I came in around 2:30 and it was pretty busy but there was no line to wait in which is always a good thing. I ordered half of a southwest chicken salad and was very disappointed. Right after the lady got done making my salad I stared at a almost empty bowl with hardly any lettuce. And probably only one dribble of dressing. When I went to pay I told the man who rang me up I got hardly any lettuce in my salad so he went and put some more on. But no dressing. So I ended up eating basically a plan salad, hardly any dressing and bland lettuce. I don't recommend coming here. I guess that service for my salad is what they call a \"half of a salad\" = hardly any lettuce and dressing. I won't be coming back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"For the love of all that is good and right in the world, why do all of their employees seem to be confused as to the reason they are behind the counter.  Nobody ever seems to know who should be helping customers, and they are almost always busy with other tasks like trying to look busy with other tasks.  I rarely walk out of there not feeling like I rudely interrupted some very important task and I had the nerve to ask them to make me a salad.  They are close and sometimes I just really like the feeling of being unwanted, you know.  It's the warm fuzzy feeling you get when someone despises you for asking them to do their job."}
{"text":"The food is good, but this particular location is so unorganized, slow and dirty it's ridiculous. Unfortunately, they are one of the fast and close lunch options for employees of the Biltmore Mall complex, so they continue to get our business. Avoid lunch hours and don't expect friendly service.  I didn't think it was possible for this place to get any worse but it has. Rude!!! Shame on you for hiring mean, miserable people. I gave you a second change but never again. I almost walked out of your excuse of an establishment in tears. Get your act together paradise or panera or whatever you are.   Don't waste your time or money here."}
{"text":"This is a newer location for the restaurant and was impressed!  The atmosphere is more semi to formal then other locations and very cozy and comfortable.  Went in there this past Saturday evening to host a Tupperware social and it was very pleasant and NOT noisy as other locations.  Staff was friendly and very helpful.  We even stayed late and they were very patient with us.  Roast beef Asiago very tasty and the french onion soup was awesome with the melted cheese inside.  Their chocolate chip cookies are Wonderful! Thanks again Arrowhead Paradise Bakery, plan to see you again soon! :)"}
{"text":"Excellent place to eat a fresh and healthy lunch. I tried the pick 2 deal with the greek salad and chicken flatbread, it was so yummy. I also ate a brownie, I tasted like a home made one. Chocolate chip cookies was also delicious."}
{"text":"I only come here because it's convenient. Food is good as always, but service is a cluster*ck at lunch time. They seem understaffed and a lot of the teens working here seem half asleep."}
{"text":"Food tasted fine, but the service was seriously lackluster. All the employees just seemed tired and disinterested in everything, kind of dismissive and aloof too. They didn't seem to care at all. I guess as long as the food tasted fine, cool, but there are Paradise Bakeries all over the valley, so I'd go to a different one if you have a choice."}
{"text":"Uh. Is this a Panera? Out-of-towner looking for a straight salad.  When I walked in I thought I was transported to the Panera back home.  I like that you can put whatever you want on the salad ... Panera doesn't do that."}
{"text":"Pesto sacchettini , Tomato mozzarella panini. DONE!!!! Magnificent customer service and was so kind to the max. :))"}
{"text":"Today I had a small Blue Cheese Salad and cup of Autumn Squash soup. Both were pretty good.   The service for the most part left something to be desired however. Like maybe some acknowledgment? My boyfriend told me I needed to order my salad straight from the salad-making girl with the little hat, who was standing there messing with the ingredients trying to look busy. I was standing directly in front of her, waiting for her to look up at me. She didn't. Still standing there with my empty tray, I asked my boyfriend, \"Are you sure this is where I order a salad?\". She still wouldn't look up. Sigh... fine! \"Um, excuse me, is this where I order a salad?\" Seriously, that pisses me off that I have to ask. She also looked like she REALLY hated making my salad. Maybe she would rather work in the back or something...  The soup girl was extremely friendly and complimented my shirt and the b/f's Halloween costume. I liked her."}
{"text":"Mad rush to grab something to go before I boarded my flight - managed to score a delicious half of a turkey panini sandwich, a little bowl of scorching hot but tasty lemon chicken orzo soup, got a giant iced drink and a fat chocolate chip cookie to go for a reasonable price. It was just the right amount of food to get me through a long day of travel.  Staff were very nice, though we had a hard time hearing each other due to the noise in the background."}
{"text":"I had never, ever been recognized because of Yelp...until a few days ago!  I was frankly concerned that the first time someone recognized me because of Yelp, it would be in connection with one of my less \"flattering\" reviews.  And I take very seriously, the old adage \"never mess with people that prepare and handle your food\"!  So I was surprised and delighted (and more than little relieved) that my \"first time\" was with Jennifer, at this Paradise Bakery outpost!  Jennifer was sweet and friendly, she was even complimentary about my humble attempts to create interesting reviews!  I not only appreciate her reading my little stories, I really appreciated her saying \"Hi\"!  The Beautiful Carin and I used to frequent this PB when we lived in Scottsdale Mountain, but I hadn't been here in some time.  We would have a croissant or a muffin and drink refill after refill of PB's very good coffee, read our Sunday papers and plot and plan the week ahead.  It was and is a great spot to just hang out!  One of my clients suggested it as a place to meet...and since they have pretty decent baked goodies, good coffee, free wifi and, of course, Jennifer (and a lot of nice people like Jennifer helping you at PB), I said \"why not\".  Have you noticed that almost no one (including me, BTW) meets at their offices anymore...or at least rarely?  Out of 8 client meetings in Phoenix this week, 3 were at an office...the rest took place at a coffee shop, or a restaurant, or on a park bench late at night (OK, I'm kidding about that last one...probably).  This location is my favorite of all the PB's (and judging from my PB Frequent Flyer Card, I have clearly been to nearly all of them, so I think I'm qualified to judge).  Drop by, grab a Lemon Poppyseed Muffin (unless you have a drug test scheduled for later in the day), a bottomless cup of coffee, fire up the iPad and make this place your office away from the office.  And say \"Hi\" to my new friend, Jennifer!"}
{"text":"Haven't been to this location yet but it's annoying when a company puts pictures of their food in the gallery. I want to see what it really looks like before I go. The company of course pays for the best most beautiful pictures to be featured. But it's frequently not what you get. And it's also annoying when the first reviewer isnt reviewing anything."}
{"text":"Panera is ok. They have a decent amount of selections, but they are not amazing to me. I go there if there is nothing better. I had half a sandwich with tomato soup. There were apples on the sandwich, and they were sliced very thin. That was good, but the soup was just so so."}
{"text":"The chicken Cesar salad wasn't special in any way. I was starving though so I didn't argue my wife about eating here. There are a lot of tastier choices, but if you need/want to go the healthy route this might be your best option. I definitely like their cookies, but I'm done with the salads, if I happen to eat here again I guess I'll try a sandwich."}
{"text":"What happened to this place?!  I have a special place in my heart for paradise bakery. This location is located inside the food court at Superstition Springs Mall. We have eaten here on multiple occasions over the past few years and it has been pretty good. It's not as good or as fresh as a standalone store but still decent.   While shopping, we stopped by on our way out to grab two of their amazing iced coffees and two cookies. The girl at the counter told me they were out of coffee but \"it's okay because we have enough for one small.\" The small amount of coffee she was talking about was sitting on the counter in a large cup, uncovered, and looked like an employees drink that someone has been sipping out of. Um, gross, no thank you. She didn't offer to make more and had none brewing... How does a bakery place run out of coffee!?!?   We just ordered our two cookies. Cookies that make paradise one of a kind! The cookies came out hard as a rock, looked and tasted old like they were made 2 days ago.   This place used to be so fresh and hoppin but now it's a waste of space. What happened Paradise? :("}
{"text":"Either staff it right and train the employees or shut it down.  This place gives Panera a bad image.  I've been here three times and each one has been slow, short staffed, and the employees act like it was their first day on the job.   Actually standing in line right now and it's been 15 minutes since I ordered my sandwich."}
{"text":"Not impressed. They don't even reheat the cinnamon rolls. You'd think a bakery would serve warm pastries! Chai latte is bitter...   Service was fine but the product want worth it."}
{"text":"This is the type of train wreck that can only be fixed with mass demotions and hiring a competent manager. Irrespective of the early hours these employees are literally sleepwalking. It took 15 minutes to get a coffee and they're completely unprepared for average amounts of foot traffic. How depressing..."}
{"text":"We've come here a few times, mostly for light meals. DD likes their Fuji Apple Salads. I've had their Black Bean soup. The employee, who was a really nice kid, allowed me to read the ingredient label so that I could ensure it was vegan-friendly. That was a much appreciated gesture.   The soup was decent; it was simply ok. Nothing particularly special that I'd go out of my way to get again. But if you're in the area and in need of a vegan-friendly soup, it's a solid choice.   Earlier this year, I ordered a sugar cookie cake for my DD. The price was reasonable and they decorated it as requested (with a basketball). However, DD said it was too hard. (It wasn't vegan, so of course I couldn't eat it.)  Not great. Not bad. It's A-OK."}
{"text":"Worst muffin ever. Only 2 \"blueberries\" in the whole muffin. It was more like a stale piece of bread with crumbs falling everywhere.  Very disappointing. I do not recommend eating at this establishment."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed meals at dozens of Paradise Bakery & Cafe's.  My husband loves the salads.  My granddaughter can't live without the Mac 'n  Cheese.  The experience is consistently good.  Today, at this store, it was even better!!!  The staff was very well-trained and super-friendly.  If I  could possibly eat another bite, I'd go right back in and do it again!"}
{"text":"This is basically the \"Panera Bread\" of AZ IMO. Great mac 'n cheese. Yummy sandwiches and a great massive customizable salad bar. And it's a pretty large space with lots of seating and menu options."}
{"text":"Pretty much not that many options in this wing of the airport, especially at 7am. considering inside an airport the food was OK. took longer then u'd think but wasn't like annoying long or anything, since I'm chill. They gots coffee stuffs, but I don't really play that, as I'm gonna sleep the whole time on the plane."}
{"text":"Always enjoy coming here.  This morning I had not had coffee yet and the girl behind the counter must have known.  People here seem like they really like working here.  FYI, the scones are really good!"}
{"text":"you guys need to do some training on how to treat customers. when I used to come here, I enjoyed the experience. but now I just feel like the employees don't care about their customers. the cashier/ soup person has the rudest attitude I have ever encountered at this establishment.  other than that the food is good and the place is clean."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Employees always seem extremely unhappy to be here.  Food is not worth the price. Tastes like hospital cafeteria food.   Don't waste your time. Wild Flower is in the same complex and it's a better version of this place."}
{"text":"uuuuuugh. What a sorry disappointment of a meal. The BF and I went here for dinner tonight and it was pretty not good. I got the pick two with the balsamic steak 'panini' and the chicken stew. The BF got a turkey 'panini.' Well....his 'panini' was barely toasted, let alone a panini. My sandwich was toasted but the steak was pretty gross....chewy and tasted like it came out of a bag. The tomatoes were mealy. The whole thing was sad. The chicken stew was decent, but had that plastic -y look to it. I always find that a little disturbing. It came with a biscuit that was really gross and didn't go with the stew at all. Both of our cookies were raw in the middle. Plus the meal cost 20$. Really?! 20$?!?! Are they kidding me? I could get a countless amount of better food for that money. Not awesome. Not even good. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"The best food choice in T2 but it doesn't have much competition in this second rate terminal for food."}
{"text":"Food is great when they get your order right or haven't ran out of something.  The staff needs to learn how to treat customers better...thus the 2 stars."}
{"text":"I tried this out because I really like Panera Bread and this is really close to campus.  After trying this on a whim, I'm now a regular customer 4+ days per week.  Admittedly it is quite busy around the noon hour, but I feel that is true of most good restaurants.  I order a salad every time I go and they are great about remembering my order  and the tweaks I make to their salads.  They always seem willing to fix any mistakes that I've seen and I think the staff is great.  The salads are great and the cookies which are BOGO are amazing.  Like most establishments in this niche they are what some would call pricey, but the food is good and if you're a Midwestern student you get a discount."}
{"text":"I grabbed an early lunch here on a rainy Sunday morning.  This was one popular place for Sunday brunch - tons of people enjoying an omelette while reading the newspaper or surfing the internet.  Even though it was packed I was still able to grab a table in the corner and enjoy my delicious vegetarian sandwich.  I was surprised my meal came with a cookie...so much for my healthy meal!  I wish we had a place like this back home, it's a nice change to Subway."}
{"text":"This place reminded me of panera because of the bakery/sandwich and salad type place.  They have healthy options as well.  When I came here though, I kinda wanted to indulge in the baked goods. Whoops! Hopefully, still made with healthy ingredients.  They have many options.  I got their famous chocolate chip cookie and a banana chocolate chip muffin.  Both were really good!  The cookie was warm and moist.  It had the perfect crisp and chew.  Wish I got milk.  The muffin was top heavy and huge.  Again, perfect combo of crispy (top) and soft moist (bottom).  Can't wait for my next PHX layover."}
{"text":"Paradise, which is in reality Panera in every respect now, is the truly underrated and unknown best place to study. Almost every seat/table has its own set of outlets, there's wifi that's stable and reliable( although it does have a 90 minute limit during \"peak hours\", but I've honestly never had it enforced on me.  The food is pretty decent, there's baked goods, coffee, tea, and basically any other study snack you could want. And the parking is plentiful and there are a bunch of food stops including Which Which, Starbucks, and even a mall across the street.  Basically, this is the perfect place to study if you have no other place to study."}
{"text":"Who is this guy? He's my hero, Super Paradise Baker! The manager at PB&C. I came in with an old loyalty card that was half full. Let's see what PB&C can do for me...Nothing, out of luck, can't do a thing or give me credit on the ELoyalty card I have with me. So Karen and I sat down with our coffee and we're enjoying each other's company. Then Karen says why don't you ask the manager? So I did and he was all smiling and happy to see my old loyalty card. He gave me some terrific choices and I'm no dummy so I chose chocolate chip cookies. I thought oh, sweet, a cookie for me and one for Karen. Then I nearly fell at his feet when he said, How about a dozen? I'll go bake up a fresh batch for you!\"   My hero, I was so shocked I didn't get his name, but he's tall and good looking with a black curly, well groomed beard, which I normally don't care for, but on this guy it was  darling! I really want to introduce him to my daughter! Thanks so much!!"}
{"text":"My first visit ever to a Paradise Bakery. Service was great as I went through the line, and it went downhill from there. I ordered a Pick Two with a half turkey sandwich and cup of soup. No wheat rolls left, only white rolls for soup. Virtually all the tables in the restaurant were dirty at 7:30pm. There were more employees working than customers in the store at the time I sat down at the only clean table in the place and ate my soup. My sandwich wasn't brought to my table until after I had already finished my soup. Nothing terrible, but nothing worth more than three stars."}
{"text":"Really good sandwich (turkey avocado blt) and the free cookie was one of the best choc chip cookies I've ever had."}
{"text":"They never disappoint! Consistantly great, clean, friendly and healthy (ish) I don't live close but I make the trek at least once a week because though I have searched NO one does it better!"}
{"text":"This is the only P.B. I've been to, ..a lot! Since avocado is one of my main food grous, I love the turkey avocado blt.  It has olive oil mayo, which I also use at home :) I haven't been able to stop ordering the turkey cranberry! It's perfect in everyway! Bread is super fresh and soo good! The salads here are huge and will leave u feeling healthy all day. Poppyseed and choco chip muffins are moist and also huge. Cookies make my day, ESP the peanut butter! Strawberry smoothies are really good, but the frozen mocha I tried only once.. Not my thing. Love the soup here too, broccoli is my true love:). This place does the trick when Starbucks is closed + they're going strong 24/7 with caffeine/coffee. Super friendly staff. Just remember to order your drink somewhere after security or eat before u hit TSA. That is all:)"}
{"text":"IN A NUTSHELL: Typical \"higher end\" soup and sandwich chain. This place, in my opinion, is a logistical nightmare.  LOCATION/PARKING: Just off Scottsdale Rd in Old Scottsdale. Easy in and out parking lot.  ORDERING PROCESS: Extremely confusing. There is no clear place to order. At least during our time there, there wasn't. Even though I was standing in line, I was skipped about three times.   Descriptions of menu items were lacking. More photos would be nice. They have a \"build your own salad\" set up (like Subway) but nothing is labeled. There are at least ten different dressings and you just have to point and ask \"what is that one? The red one second to the right?\" Even a sign would be helpful. Many people were confused.   People next to me ordered soup. The staff asked \"do you want the topping?\" More than once I heard people ask \"well what is the topping?\" One employee actually praised a customer for \"doing a good job for their first time\" because \"most people have no clue what's going on here when they order.\"   You get those numbered table tents so they can bring your order, but nobody I saw actually used them. They sit on the tray as you travel down the line, requesting food items, your order being built as you go. When you get to the end, your order is complete and they take the table tent.   FOOD SELECTIONS: Seemed okay but I am sure that I missed a lot?!  VALUE: $10 for a salad and half of a panini. Meh.  FINAL VERDICT: Even though the employees were nice and tried their best to help the customers navigate through this restaurant's ordering nightmare, I would absolutely never return.   Whoever designed how this place is supposed to function really needs to reevaluate the layout. The whole thing is nonsensical."}
{"text":"Aside from this being a fine place to work and have a casual meeting with average internet, there's nothing great about it.  I sensed a bit of attitude from the cashier when trying to modify a breakfast sandwich to be on a bagel instead of the normal bread. The result was a bagel with barely a taste of egg - a poor excuse for a breakfast sandwich and not worth what I paid for it.  The black iced americano I ordered was absolute garbage. It literally tasted like cigarettes - I couldn't drink it past the first sip."}
{"text":"Ew. I wish I could give zero stars, but then I wouldn't be able to complain about how awful this place is. Worst paradise bakery, ever. EVER. I'm surprised I didn't get food poisining eating here. My sandwich (chicken walnut) had a teaspoon of chicken salad on it, whith maybe one walnut, and mealy tomato, and wet soggy lettuce. The only good part about it was the bread. It was the tiniest sandwich I've ever gotten at a sandwich place. My boyfriend's club sandwich had gelatinous ham and turkey on it, like oscar meyer style. We also ordered a box of 15 chippers. They were AWFUL. It was as if the broke all of the chippers into even smaller pieces. The oatmeal chocolate chip ones didnt have a single chocolate chip. Someone must have forgotten to add them to the batter. The dark chocolate white chip ones were so dry, and the lemon ones tasted like butter and remorse.  I seriously think this location totally blows. The other locations I go to are always good, but this place is baaaaad. Mall food court bad. Jesus, get it together!"}
{"text":"Well it was a salad. Kinda. Better than most airport food but the salad was nothing like what I would usually get. They had 3 veggies as a topping and not really anything else. Service was also usual for airports. Bad."}
{"text":"I'm here at this moment. Not too happy with the lack of service. I was standing in one of 3 unmarked lines, had 2 women blatantly cut in front of me and the girl at the register helped them anyway. I then walked over to a different register to ask where I could pick up my order, my office ordered lunch earlier and it should be ready. The girl at the register saw me walk up to her and wait for her to give the customer her change,but instead of asking me if I had a question she just beckoned over the next person. I made eye contact again and told her I just had a quick question. I was told to sit and wait to be called, then I had to restate I called in the order earlier, I was then directed back to the first line (the one I was cut in) long story short I saw our bag of food the whole time but for reasons within their control, I waited 10 minutes just to pick it up. Management should put up a sign or rope to fix the multiple line issues and rude people who think their lunch break is more valuable than others'."}
{"text":"When it comes to airport eatin's, Paradise Bakery is at the top of the list. Yes, it's a chain, but it's not fast, over priced and sloppy. Rather it is fast, appropriately priced and prepared with care. It's the same great quality that you would expect from any other Paradise. The Fuji Apple Salad is yum and the Thai Chicken Wrap is fantastic. The service and cleanliness are great. Sometimes you can even get free cookie samples at the counter and most meals include a cookie. Just stopping by Paradise for some \"chippers\" to take to your friends or clients or just for a snack on the plane is worth it.   My only hangup is that Paradise is pre-security, so unless you're eating before security, skip the drink and dress your salad or wrap before you get to TSA. Parfaits do not pass security. You've been warned!"}
{"text":"The Paradise Cafe in the C concourse of PHX airport was so filthy today it was downright disgusting. You would think perhaps they were busy and short staffed, but there was one other customer ordering besides me and there were 9 employees just behind the counter- perhaps more in the kitchen. The garbage overflowing everywhere was gross, especially in the food prep area. To be fair, the food is usually decent, but I can only imagine what's in it with such neglect for sanitation.   Follow up- I emailed the company to point out my Yelp review.  They admitted it was unacceptable and said they were providing additional training to staff. I have seen the restaurant since and it was noticeably improved. Still not super clean, but much better."}
{"text":"I came here to get some sandwiches for a few family members to go. First visit here I ended up leaving as they were rude when I tried to order breakfast and it was my first time there, I missed it by less than 5 min. But the girl was extremely rude and treated me like I was dumb, because I didn't understand the ordering process since I'd never been.  Today I gave them a shot again and and picked up some sandwiches to go since my Dad and I are putting up a Gorilla play system for my 3 boys and were starving.  I wasn't greeted as I arrived and they had maybe 6 people in there and had about 5 people standing around behind he counter bored.  Again it was some kid who didn't seem to understand the concept of customer service and I explained I was new and wasn't sure where to order and he just asked me what I wanted. So apparently he was the one to take my order. However he should have just greeted me and asked what can I help you order today?  Well I ordered 3 of the croissant clubs and a grilled cheese for my boys to share. All were whole sandwiches. I also got 3 of those flip flop cookies to surprise my boys with and I got a lrg tea. I was shocked when she rang it all up! $43 later and when I get home there was hardly any bacon on any of the clubs. If I'm paying dang near $10 a sandwich, I expect quality. It was not. All 3 of us with the clubs were disappointed by the quality and the price.   None of us will be going back again. Just overpriced basic food. I've been to many other sandwich shops that are less expensive and are WAY better, or even the same prices but you get heartier, worth your $ sandwiches. Plus poor service. Never again."}
{"text":"I go here for the free wifi and the bleu cheese crumble salad. That's it. Bleu cheese, craisins, sunflower seeds all on a bed of romaine. LOVE IT. I don't think I've ever had anything else on the menu, now that I think about it. Free wifi will get me in every time, that's for sure! I chose this location because I was in Phoenix in-between activities, and didn't want to drive back to Gilbert. This was at the Biltmore, and yeah, you knew you were in a Paradise Bakery at the Biltmore. Kind of funny actually. What can I say? I like to people-watch. :-)"}
{"text":"I am extremely impressed and pleased with their food quality, taste, and price.  I had the butternut squash ravioli with a berry smoothie.   Tasted great and so much healthier than typical airport fast food. I'm very impressed and appreciative."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and salads. Very fresh and clean. Every location is very good and consistent with food preparation and presentation. The cookies are great too. Very good place for family and casual dates. The prices are very reasonable and portions are a good size."}
{"text":"I'm not really a sandwich snob, maybe I'm a little bit of a bread snob. And I don't eat meat, so clearly there is a certain scope to my review that will not cover a wide array of their menu.  However, my review is not focused so much on their menu as it is on their ingredients. Reality check: I know it's a chain. I don't expect Simply Bread or McClendon carrots. But the disappointment is still high.  The sign is so pretty, their logo is pleasing. But I don't like the flashing of a \"healthy eating\" concept when your bread is made with high fructose corn syrup among other unpronounceable items and I am not so partial to soggy sandwiches that fall apart even though there isn't any sauce or cheese present (why exactly is every sandwich I've ordered so wet? do they dry the lettuce after washing it? do they wash the bread?) I haven't really encountered any nice people working here to make up for the lacking food at high prices. Not to mention I thought this location in particular was not well kept.  So why 2 stars? I don't know. My only 1 star review was REALLY bad. This wasn't quite as appalling so I've left it at 2. I wish we had Panera here. It's not perfect, but it's a step up."}
{"text":"Disappointed with this location yet again! Sandwich was 'thrown' together, no finesse. You never know what your going to get! Inconsistencies! Secondly, I asked for a wheat roll and was given the opposite. And when I told the girl she acted like it was no big deal! No apology, no smile, no personality for that matter. And lastly aren't you suppose to get a cookie when you get a soup and sandwich? Like I said, inconsistencies."}
{"text":"I can't complain about the food but my service was below average. There seemed to be a lot of people working but not much going on. Maybe a better system needs to be in place. Also, a little dirty."}
{"text":"i love their mac and chesse, but was a bit disappointed to see it in a plastic bag being microwaved.  for some reason i always thought it was fresh and warm."}
{"text":"Decent spot in the mall for coffee that isn't overly dark (Starbucks downstairs), cookies that are tasty, and some soup/sandwich options that are much better than the offerings at merchants there in the food court."}
{"text":"The mispelled two words on my birthday cookie:  the word '60th' and the word 'birthday'.  How do you accidentally write '60ht' and 'birtday'??  They manage to cram chicken stock or other chicken parts into every single soup, including a basic tomato soup.  And don't bother asking if the \"vegetable soup\" is vegetarian either, because they pretty much all have chicken parts in them.  What's most frustrating is that they give you attitude if you politely ask, because they're probably sick of hearing the same question over and over.  Why not fix the soups like your competition did, and this will be a non-issue.  This place is 180 degrees from Wildflower Bread company a few miles away that offers far better and healthier soups, sandwiches, and salads."}
{"text":"In a nutshell: Bakery in C concourse of Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport  I'll keep this one short. Needed a quick snack to tie me over before I flew back to LA so I came here. Ordered the super fruit smoothie and a chocolate chip cookie. It looked like they were closing, as most things were around this time. The guy helping me out gave me two instead of one, and I walked out of there spending only 6 bucks.  Great service, and I was out of there quick without spending a lot of money.  Not bad."}
{"text":"They have some tasty cookies! Obviously, this place is inside an aiport - so, it's not like you can expect the best. But, this place is surprisingly good for what it is.   Next time you're in the good ol' Sky Harbor, give them a shot."}
{"text":"Horrendously run place. Not a good process of taking orders. 9 people working and it took over fifteen minutes to get a half a grilled cheese sandwich. One person working the register and I got skipped over twice for getting my soup. Poor processing and not good service."}
{"text":"This place is decent but they have cut WAY down on portion sizes. I was shocked when I got home and saw the half salad I had ordered. Looked like it was supposed to be on a kids menu it was so small. Prices haven't cut at all tho, seems ironic. Won't be back, I can go to a full service restaurant for what I pay for my familys meal at paradise bakery/panera."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this location several times   sandwiches are decent and the coffee is good.  I went this morning craving bagels and was so disappointed.   The bagels were undercooked to such a degree that even putting them in the oven at home to cook them a bit more didn't really help.  we just threw them out. they just weren't edible."}
{"text":"This is more of a review on paradise bakery in general not just this location.  Way overrated and overpriced.  I keep trying to convince myself that this place is good but I just don't see it.  Every time I go I try and pick something that can't be messed up and I know I'll love.  Unfortunately that never seems to happen.  I'm always left wishing I had ordered something else or nothing at all."}
{"text":"What's not to love about this place?  Fantastic soups, salads,  wraps,  and cookies.  I can honestly say I've never had a bad meal here."}
{"text":"Always delicious food here at paradise backery. This location is located outside the security checkpoint.   I highly recommend getting a bite here if you want something quick, delicious, and on the healthier side. Sandwiches are awesome and so are the salads. And the cookies, ohh the cookies...delicious. They are usually buy one get one free. And an fyi for ya,  you get a free cookie when you buy a sandwich."}
{"text":"Decent food but soups are not made fresh. I find the way they display their menu irritating as you can't see it when you walk in or when you are ordering! Why not? It ends up holding up the line. And always pay attention at the register because there is often an error."}
{"text":"Great location and a very in and out experience.... line moves fast and does not feel like being in a Starbucks as it has a much warmer setting.  As well a good overall breakfast menu."}
{"text":"Cool environment. Refillable coffee / tea. Average food and a bit pricy.  Great location."}
{"text":"Grand opening! So far so good, much more modern than the old location down the street. I do miss being able to see the salad ingredients and mix it up every once in a while, however this is much better than the old location with the single long line where you are playing leap frog around other customers.  The front area seems a little confusing but I have a feeling I'll be using the mobile kiosk or ordering at my table a lot more. Oh ya! They do have a drive thru so there's that. It will be interesting to find out what things are easy or hard to order using these methods.  Some of the seating is a little goofy but there's plenty of it for what feels like a smaller location, several spots you can bring a laptop, tuck away and eat/work without being so out in the open or it being too loud. They definitely maximized efficiency and every inch of the space so it can be a little confusing at first when you're trying to figure out where everything is.  Staff is really friendly, some familiar faces from the old location. (Noticed several \"supervisors\" or managers walking around talking to people, making sure people were taken care of at could figure out the lay of he land, they did a great job for an opening day, kudos to Jasmine and Jared!)  Overall great experience and I look forward to enjoying more lunches here again soon."}
{"text":"Their new menu is ok but I prefer the old one.  I miss the old breads.  I will still come here when I can but not for breakfast anymore.  No more quiche muffins :("}
{"text":"Paninis are consistently good wit other similar chains. Very busy. we had a 5 minute wait for our sandwiches. Best place to eat at skyharbor"}
{"text":"I have been frequenting Paradise Bakery for years and love everything that comes out of their bakery...except at this location. I have been having pregnancy cravings for their Lemon Poppyseed Muffins, especially once I found out that Panera wouldn't be carrying that particular recipe. I have been to this Paradise 3 times the last week trying to get my Lemon Poppyseed Muffin and they have been overbaked every time. I bought it the first time, but the top was so crunchy and the bottom was completely dry.  I can't believe they continue to put out such a poor product. Other locations don't seem to have the same problem. I can't imagine this is the only baked item that is getting overbaked. Get it together!"}
{"text":"I used to come to Paradise bakery just for their cookies and chippers.  But now I've come to love their Spinach Power salad and their steak and white cheddar panini.  Both are so delicious and make me full after lunch.  I also get their large iced tea every time - whichever their flavor of the day is.    They are pretty on top of getting through lines - there are stations and people are manning each station so there's no confusion.  If you want a soup or salad, skip the area where you would order a sandwich - it will save you time.  Just go directly to the station that you want and order your food.    I also have their frequent diner card which allows me to get free cookies or salads or sandwiches sometimes."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner last night got the choose two broccoli cheese soup and cheddar steak both were good the sandwich had amazing good spot on flavor but I'm knocking off two starts for the soup ya it's hard to mess up broccoli cheese soup and even though the flavor was decent they had no saltine crackers who I ask serves soup of any kind and doesn't have crackers ?(I asked) This place."}
{"text":"I'm done with this particular location.  Customer service is beyond rude and I feel that if I'm paying $10 for a salad, you should at least have a smile on your face, fake or not.  This rude little girl (yes, if you act an ass as an adult you are nothing but a child to me) had the worst attitude ever.  You would have thought I asked her to grow the harvest for the salad I asked for.  I always order off of the menu because I can't stand when people have complicated orders, I just asked for no bleu cheese in my Cobb salad. This girl made it seem like an inconvenience.  I'm also pleasant to people who are making my food even when I can see you making it.  I said thank you and she gave me no eye contact or a your welcome.  She just handed me the hot ass bowl and moved on.  I'm pretty sure if I was not well in the head, I would have tossed that salad right back at her burnt burgundy haired ass but I didn't.  But best believe, they won't be getting my business ever again"}
{"text":"Never got the opportunity to order any kind of food here because the stupid ass manager was to lazy to take my order and to horny giving her number to two guys begging them to call her while the 2 other gentlemen employee's acted as if no one was waiting in line."}
{"text":"Their slogan \"We're know for our cookies\" speaks for itself!  Best cookies around!  I'm from out of town, but these cookies were so good, I needed to pack a dozen more in my luggage.  Can't wait to come back.  The chocolate chip cookies are to die for."}
