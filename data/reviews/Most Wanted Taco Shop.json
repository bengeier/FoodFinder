{"text":"Good tacos here. Its in North phoenix if you live far it wort it going you won't regret it. I tried there tacos and they are bomb. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"A very fun Taqueria.  They know how to make a first timer feel welcome with their samples.  The wrestling to theme is cool  Good option for Tacos or Burritos."}
{"text":"They seem to have changed the name of this place, at least on the signage out front, so we were confused at first. But if you go to the address listed, it's the same place.  Very easy--just choose your taco meat from a menu (fillings are ranked in order of spiciness), toppings, and you're good to go! Spicy means SPICY--even the barely-spicy items were a lot for me to handle. I had one chicken, one pork, and one beef taco, and all were amazing (they even cooked up the beef on the stovetop for me right after I ordered). I wish I lived in Phoenix so I could return!"}
{"text":"I went here with my family to try something fun and different. We had an awesome experience! Friendly service and great Mexican food. You can try all the meats, which they actually encourage. The meat have a lot of flavor. I got the Barbacoa which was excellent and spicy. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"For tacos they are a little pricy. They are good but I'm not sure that I would want to pay that much for tacos. Very clean and nice decor."}
{"text":"Came here when I was in town for the Chargers game. SO DAMN GOOD!! We told them we had never been there and let us sample everything.....EVERYTHING! I ended up getting a burrito with Al Pastor, but it was so hard to decide. Everything tasted so good. Be sure to get a churro before you leave, they fry it fresh. Nothing beats this place. Next time I'm in town, this will be my first stop."}
{"text":"There seems to be a bit of an identity crisis with naming this place, but I hope they never change their recipes. Our party had veggie taco salad, veggie, red chile beef, asada beef, and green chile pork tacos. Besides having some cilantro end up on a couple of tacos due to a \"no\" being misconstrued as a \"yes\", our meal hit the spot. I am sure any of us will return if ever back in town."}
{"text":"Found it on yelp! It was delicious! I have 5 tacos 2 creamed chicken, 2 pastor and 1 barcacoa. Best tacos I have had in phoenix. Love the level of spiciness. My three kids shared a burrito! Overall great place and I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Fresh meats and veggies! Rice was perfectly cooked, but the tortilla was a little under cooked store bought :( but the staff was friendly and the atmosphere is awesome! I will definitely be back for more! THEY ARE NOT ASSOCIATED WITH THE ORIGINAL LUCHA LIBRE but they are still delicious"}
{"text":"I will echo what all the review below.The business is family owned and operated and the customer service is amazing! They let you sample all the meats which are off the charts! The restaurant is super clean and they have tv's to watch sports. They make their own taco salad shells and I can't rave about them enough! Please come by and support this amazing local business."}
{"text":"This is place is neat and creative. I have never seen luchadores in a style of decor. Pretty cool and the tacos are really good but I will warn that they were spicy. Just the decor itself makes me want to bring back friends to see."}
{"text":"The wet taco had a terrible sauce on it, the regular burrito had soggy black beans so it was a wet taco by the time we sat down. Poor imitation of Chipotle. Would not repeat 2/10.  I don't think that it was all bad, the lady was nice and gave us samples. By themselves the meat was good but in a burrito the other ingredients were drowning out the flavor."}
{"text":"Had a variety of tacos and a churro. Delicious! The place is very spacious and entertaining."}
{"text":"So long Chipotle.. This place is so much better!!!  More meat selections, staff will let you sample the various proteins.  We had the wet beef el pastor burrito, absolutely delicious!!"}
{"text":"Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing at the wrong time, but my enchiladas were hardly that. They were pretty much tacos with a little, and I mean little, bit of enchilada sauce, turned on their side and literally folded in half. The super nachos were big, but lacking in flavor and cheese, mostly just beans. It could be that they were more bland due to them being meatless, I dont know. My husband picked up food for us before and they forget to make my burrito enchilada style, so needless to say this is my second disappointment. I will say the meats do taste amazing. I got the barbacoa beef and green chile pork. So ya, stick with the burritos and tacos, and if your getting a \"wet\" burrito for takout, make sure it really is \"wet\" before you leave."}
{"text":"I love this place. For a girl who loves Chipotle- I love this place more.  I am not from Phoenix but if I was I would eat here at least once a week. I had the burrito which was massive and more than I could have expected.  They offered to have us taste the food before we ordered our food seeing as we had never been there before.  The decor is tacky but the owner/staff are amazing and more than willing to help you with what ever you want.  If they served alcohol this place would have it all- that being said they easily earned five stars.  I love this place and recommend it to anyone and everyone."}
{"text":"We have been back time and time again and the food never disappoints! My only complaint would be the cheap plastic silver wear...so hard to even cut through my food. Keep up the food food!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! The PASTOR is bomb!!! Love the decor, food, and staff. Super friendly. Awesome all around!"}
{"text":"Fantastic tacos! Very fresh ingredients and super friendly staff. Will probably come back again this week."}
{"text":"Great food. Martha the owner chat with us, she let us taste some samples of the chicken and meats before we made our choice. The food had great flavor and the restaurant was very clean. We will eat there again. make sure you check out all the luchadores masks very colorful walls you feel like you are in Mexico City's local restaurants."}
{"text":"Some truly great tacos and burritos here!  I drive here from Goodyear about twice a month but it would probably be every week if I lived closer  The food is always delicious and unless they have run out of their awesome pinto beans for burritos, I always leave satisfied and full!   I love their assortment of meats that include; tinga, chicken, pastor, cochinita pibil, cream chicken, carnitas, carne asada, and barbacoa."}
{"text":"My wife and I are new to this area and while searching for our new taco place I came across this very unique place on yelp. The workers were extremely helpful and kind enough to offer a sample of all their flavors of meat! I got two large and two small tacos and both are of good proportion for the price and money. This place has a very welcoming atmosphere and at first glance it might look small but it opens up to a larger dining area after the register. It also looks like they are planning to expand at the time we went in. The churro we ordered was freakin awesome and very satisfying. Overall this place really sets itself apart from almost every other taco place we've been to since moving here and if you are ever in the area give this place a try!"}
{"text":"First time here! Really good tacos I've have had in a long time. Staff very friendly well be back defiantly!  Just like if you made them at home."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of TexMex, but neutral to authentic Mexican food meaning I don't hate it, but when I crave it I want, so I decided to go here because it was close. Now I give this place 3 stars, because it's not one of those places that knocks your socks off, but if your looking for quick quality Mexican food, and sick of chipotle this place is a cool spur of the moment find. ( I ordered a chicken taco salad, so it is kind of hard to mess that up, but the vinaigrette chicken I got was quality white meat, not the fatty cheap meat served at a typical TexMex restaurant)"}
{"text":"If you want tacos done right, go here!!!!! And great prices!!! I'll definitely be a regular there!!! The staff is so on point and so accommodating! The atmosphere is so welcoming and fun! Over all this place is near perfect"}
{"text":"This place was fabulous!  The food was delicious. After being given tastes of all the meats (each one was more delicious than the next), I ordered a burrito. It was huge and more delicious than I expected!! Everything was top quality and fresh--all the burrito ingredients worked together excellently. The staff was exceptionally friend and kind. We will definitely be back here!"}
{"text":"Unpretentious but great variety of filling and nice friendly service.  Lots of seating."}
{"text":"A solid taco spot, 5 star, though?  I reserve that type of rating for a very few.  Fresh toppings and tasty meat, very good."}
{"text":"Got the 5 small tacos. Adobada beef and green chili pork were very good. Asada was pretty plain... Try another flavor. Good price. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Yelped and found this amazing place!  Staff is extremely friendly and awesome, gave us a chance to taste the meat beforehand.   Tacos are super delicious,  love the atmosphere.     Yummy for my tummy! Muchas Gracias"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!! The food is 100% authentic Mexico City food. I've tried so many places in town and nothing compares to their food. When you arrive they'll give you a sample of all their taco meats, and let me tell you, it was so hard to pick one over the other. All of them delicious. The Barbacoa ended up being my top pick, but I'd eat any of them. Soooo good and great prices!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. The pastor tacos are amazing!! The veggie taco salad is to die fore. Super simple l of flavor  Definitely my new to go place to grab a bite"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the service was great. The gentleman behind the counter was very welcoming and offered us samples of all the meats before ordering. We ordered the street tacos with chicken, beef, and pork. The only thing I was slightly disappointed with was that they were out of rice. Everything else tasted great and fresh. Will definitely be returning soon."}
{"text":"Wow very good tacos yummy thank u.  Also customer service was great.  The only thing wrong was the hours almost didn't make it maybe should be open longer other than that A+ thank u we will be back"}
{"text":"This place is great! Wish I lived in Phoenix so I could eat here all the time. Walked in and the woman working behind the counter asked if I wanted to sample the meat. Um...yes! Figured it would be like 4 meats, but she kept giving me sample after sample from mild to the spiciest. It was like 14 samples. Settled on the Morita (sp?) pork taco salad. 10/10 would come back again."}
{"text":"Excellent street tacos, cheap and fresh.  They let you sample the different meat choices as well.  Cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great tacos and quick service. If you're a first timer you can sample the various meats/flavors. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Best taco / burrito shop in the area. The food is great and you get a lot of it. They have a lot of different meat flavors to choose from and if you aren't sure what all the flavors are they will let you sample them to see what you like. I like to get an order of five street tacos and get different flavored meat in each taco. Be warned if they say it's spicy then they mean it!"}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is delicious!  I make the hour drive once a month just to satisfy my cravings for this restaurant, the meat is well marinated, clean kitchen and dining area! Love the music!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a new place to try for the annual birthday dinner with the family.  I spent days reviewing yelp and Santos Lucha Libre kept catching my eye.  We tried calling to see if we could place a \"party order\" but the phone was busy all day.  I was ready to try to find a plan B, but just couldn't find anything that interested me.  So the wife and I decided to roll the dice and just drop in and place an order for a bunch of different items for the family to sample, and I am glad we did.  The tacos here are legit!  We got an order of each beef variety and each chicken variety, as well as a couple of burritos and cheese quesadillas for the kids.  They were all very good.  It all tasted very fresh, and the meat had excellent flavor.  The spiciest beef is just that, spicy; a little too much for some, but again good flavor just a lot of heat.  Everyone really enjoyed the food and I appreciate Santos Lucha Libre accommodating us with no notice.  I now have a new place to go when I need a good taco fix.  The best line I heard was from another customer who was walking out as we were ordering, \"I'm still Chipolte Free.\"   After tasting the food hear, that is not a bad thing to be!"}
{"text":"The food is absolutely amazing!  There is a variety of meats for the tacos and burritos ranging from mild to spicy. We were able to try each one. It was difficult to make a decision. I had the street tacos and my husband chose the wet burrito. Simply superb!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and amazing customer service. Came here based on other reviews and very glad that we did. Had the 3 enchiladas and super nachos, both were delicious. Loved the wide selection of meats with varying degrees of spiciness. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I seriously love this place. The food is always fresh, the flavors are outstanding, and the staff is always smiling, helpful and attentive."}
{"text":"Oh the selections they offer! I couldn't understand half of what I was told to try from the worker there, BUT I loved my food anyways! I played it safe and got carnitas tacos because I knew what it was by name lol and the hubby got others...sorry not much help, but we were both so happy! I think he got a chicken taco in different sauces...idk it doesn't matter because yum!  Great street tacos and location is run by a family which is fantastic! Great job guys! I hope this place survives a very long time and brings you much happiness!"}
{"text":"Our first time trying them (they are very close to our home). The burrito was huge, do plan to have a big appetite or you can share. We had the burrito enchilada style. It was good, but I have to agree, it's similar to Chipotle. The fish tacos and guacamole was fresh and delicious. Pricing was a little high, but we'd go back again."}
{"text":"In Phoenix for a few days with my husband and was wanting some Mexican cuisine. I did a quick search here on yelp for something highly rated. This was at the very top of the page. We tried it out and loves it. As it was our first time, and there was only one other couple in line - who were also there for the first time - we received samples of the differently spiced meats they have! It was a bit like a taco cart/street vendor but much better!!! They have a variety of meats, chicken, pork and lamb...quite a few were very spicy but delicious! The place was really well decorated...soo cool...in a Mexican wrestler style (think Nacho Libre). I tried the jalapeño cream cheese - I wasn't crazy about it but the tacos and meat are where it's at. Very affordable. Delicious Horchata and guacamole. The service was really very good!!!!! Will be back if ever in the area again."}
{"text":"When I first entered santos lucha libre, now most wanted taco shop, they let me try all the different types of meats available for their food. Everything tasted fantastic, and as authentic as it gets. The staff was extremely welcoming to new patrons, and wanted to get me and my girlfriend as excited about their restaurant as they were. The huge burrito that I completely devoured was one of the best burritos I have had in Phoenix and elsewhere. If you're thinking of a place to try, or just want some good food, I'd highly recommend going here."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town. Saw this place on yelp and wanted to try it out. This place is amazing. Love the food, we came here for lunch two days in a row. Thanks for the good food."}
{"text":"This place is hands down our favorite taco spot!  The owner is awesome and lets you try the many different meats available.  We like the tinga, carne asada, and green chile pork best."}
{"text":"This was an awesome place. Great concept and the staff was amazing. You get to try everything and they have awesome plus authentic flavors! Keep up the great work !! Will definitely recommend and return."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I've ever tasted and it's not even close. The ladies there are so kind and genuinely want you to love your experience and the food is incredible! This place is a must visit!"}
{"text":"This place has some of the best meat I have tasted in a while. Great service and selection! I will definitely be coming back quite often!"}
{"text":"Just about the best Mexican food I ever had. The service could have been a little better, a little slow for the the time of day, after lunch but before dinner time."}
{"text":"The food is awesome. It has become my go-to taco place in Phoenix. Try all the different meats and get a feel for the place.  I prefer to get the meat on the side and build my own tacos just because the meats have so much sauce so the tortillas can get a little moist.  The flavors are delicious and you cannot go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"Fire in full effect!!! This place is hands down my favorite mexican spot in all of Arizona. I've lived out here since 2012 and avidly search out new places and have yet to find one to top this joint. I found them with my girlfriend at the taco festival at the salt river fields in Scottsdale a few years ago. I can officially add the mexican stamp of approval on it for us weddos as I bring my girls mexican family here to eat and they love it too."}
{"text":"It's great super authentic especially the tacos the bowls are huge and if you have an appetite get the burrito with shredded chicken green salsa definitely coming back !!!"}
{"text":"Hole in the wall on the edge of town: best tacos ever!!! Chicken, pork, and beef prepared in 10+ ways in 4 or 5 levels of spicy.  Beef in green salsa! With pickled red onion!! To lick your fingers!!!"}
{"text":"I am officially in love with this place...all I can say is WOW! First of all, I grew up eating Mexican food, the home cooked stuff. So I'm coming from a very spoiled high standards point of view. That said, this place has pretty much topped the list in terms of quality, flavor, and customer service. I mean, it jumped above Carolina's even. My husband and I arrived and she (the  talented owner and chef) asked if it was our first time. Well yes, it is! She then gave us each samples of each of the meat options they offer with their menu options. EVERY one of them was delicious, so of course made it impossible to choose. So I got 3 different kinds, one in each taco, as did my husband, and then we each got a tostada on the side to get a 4th meat - yeah, THAT good!! The rest is done chipotle style where they ask what you want in your tacos or whatever you order, and add it in. The whole meal was epic, and we can't wait to return, and bring friends and family! If you visit one Mexican joint in Phoenix, come to this one. Seriously amazing, and we didn't even break $20. My wallet loves it as much as my stomach. Oh, and the people were just wonderful and I hope to see them live long, prosper, and continue making such amazing food in this amazing restaurant! Side note - I didn't even get started on how amazing the interior was. Worth a visit just to see how great the decor is!"}
{"text":"We ordered a veggie quesadilla, chips and guac, a veggie burrito bowl and horchata--all of which came up to about 20 dollars. All were good and hearty, and the servings were generous despite the affordable price.   The people behind the counter were nice and friendly. The ambiance was a bit quirky and fun. I mean, Mexican wrestlers, pink walls, glitter...it's all good.   We'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"There is a very large buzz about this place.  I have been here many times since my family likes it but its below average at best.  Basically a Chipotle ripoff with better ingredients but still a assembly line style restaurant.  I would have given 3 stars but they have some very uninspired salsas in their salsa bar.  If the salsa was dynamite I would probably keep going back.  Does this place deserve 5 stars.  I guess it depends on your scale but this isn't something that blows me away with taste and flavor."}
{"text":"The street tacos are the closest to a small town Baja street taco that I have found. The spices are fantastic, and there are new ones to try from time to time. I like hot, and I haven't tried the milder selections except in the little sample cups. Green chile is done well, and the flavors are slow cooked into the sauces and meats. Nothing is hurried in the preparation. As mentioned by others, sampling the meats is a great way to try them all. The only thing that would improve this spot is to play mask movies on the TV screens. It's hard to write about these guys without running over for my favorite tacos."}
{"text":"The tacos here were awesome. Being first timers we were offered samples of all the meat options on the menu, which were all really good. The staff was super friendly and helpful when we were figuring out our order since there were so many types of taco fillings to pick from. We loved what we ended up ordering! Can't wait to come back here on our next trip to AZ"}
{"text":"Great tacos and great service! This coming from someone that was raised in Mexico. The service rocked, they let me try every option available before making my decision, the hard part was remembering which of all I liked. Definitely recommend this place to all who enjoy Mexican street tacos."}
{"text":"Yummy authentic Mexican food. A must try for any Mexican food lover. All homemade, the Tinga is awesome. My new favorite place to enjoy REAL Mexican that I have been searching for in Phoenix. Homemade salsa bar, fresh ingredients. I would have taken a picture of my Chile Verde burrito but I ate it all, next time."}
{"text":"There is nothing bad I can say about santos Lucha libre. Not only is the food delicious, the staff is so darn nice! I always have the burrito. The set up is sort of like chipotle, but better! You can pick from many meats and toppings. The decor is pretty awesome too!"}
{"text":"The flavor is amaZING!!! I don't eat spicy stuff but this has so much flavor that I end up eating 5 small tacos! I love the ambiance and the FOOD, a must go if your spans the Phoenix area!  Finger liking GOOD! Just keep in mind that their HOT is extremely SPICY specially if you only eat mild and sweet things like me,  But we'll worth the burning tongue after each taco. I try all the beef and the tinga chicken and chicken green chile."}
{"text":"The staff is super friendly and burrito are huge & tasty. They have nice variety.  loved the decor and atmosphere."}
{"text":"OMG.  I am so jealous of the people of Pheonix because they have a deelish place like this!! I LOVE!!"}
{"text":"These are the best tacos in Phoenix. Seriously. Barbacoa, green chili, chicken tinga, all with different, and excellent flavors.   Fair warning, if it says spicy here, it is. They also the best churros I've gotten a hold of (served with caramel for dipping).  The salsa bar also seems to always have something new, and freshly made. I haven't had one yet I didn't like.  You are doing yourself a disservice if you don't come eat here."}
{"text":"in the neighborhood, with time to kill before a dr. appointment, wife & I spied this place while driving down 7th st.  super easy ordering if you don't want all kinds of crap piled on top of properly seasoned, juicy meat tacos. five small street tacos for $6.99 is a bargain. we split the plate of two each cochinita pibil, & carnitas, & one carne adovada, with just cilantro & onion atop. a grapefruit jarritos quenched our thirst. it was obvious from the first bite this was home cookin'.  if we had more time I'm sure we could have had five more. we are fans and will stop next time we are in phoenix. loved the place."}
{"text":"Finally had the chance to check this place out and I'm so glad we did! Being vegetarian (well, peskatarian) we weren't sure what to expect. But, to our surprise, there were actually vegetarian options on the menu.  The fish tacos were some of the best I ever had, I enjoyed every bite! I really also liked the salsa bar full of fresh mild to spicy salsas to try.   Service was top notch. They were so helpful and were patient to help guide us newbies through the menu. I will be recommending this place to everyone I know now!  OH! And how could I forget the flan??! Real homemade Mexican flan. We almost had to order a second one to share it was so good tasting one of our favorite desserts made right!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and unbeatable service! I love supporting family owned places! The owners do a great job keeping the lines moving and keeping the store very clean even when they are packed. If you are new to phx or just have never been here then give it a try. You will not be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"outstanding food. so many meats, fresh ingredients, friendly staff. great value. clean, modern.  highest recommendation"}
{"text":"The first thing that I saw walking in was the homie Miguel. He gave us all samples of some bomb meats. I got a fatty burrito that was the bomb.com chu feel."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!  A small family owned restaurant hidden away but has great authentic Mexican food. By far the best burrito I've EVER had!!!  The owner and her son greeted us at the door and asked us to sample each of their 8 home cooked savory meats before ordering. Every single one was excellent and cooked to perfection. They also had a choice of 5 different tortillas to choose from, all of which looked very fresh. The food in prepared right in front of you (just like Chipotle or subway) and its done with a smile and pleasant conversation.   I'd give this place 10 stars if it let me. Don't miss out!!  Try this restaurant :)"}
{"text":"OK, so here is a place that does things like I like them done. What I want, is what Santos Lucha Libre gives me. You can tell they're new, because they don't have slobbering fanboys out the door yet and when you arrive at their opening time of 11AM SHARP because you have been dreaming about their barbacoa beef and obsessing every day and ARE THEY OPEN YET ARE THEY OPEN YET they're always apologizing because they haven't got everything quite ready. You guys better get it together, because if my personal opinion has anything to do with it, you're about to get FAMOUS!  I've been to this place three times now, gotten, variously, the tacos, the taco salad and the wet burrito... oh God, the wet burrito. By far my favorite of the offerings, they claim it is a pound, but I have weighed mine. They're nearly two! It's like holding a beautiful baby wrapped up in a tortilla and smothered with red enchilada sauce, sour cream and cheese. Such a little angel! I just want to eat you!   Santos Lucha Libre is a bit short on atmosphere. But that isn't a dig, because every single one of the restaurants I love the most are always lacking in atmosphere. The owners are smart enough to keep it humble in the name of keeping prices reasonable. And reasonable they are. It's hard for my wife and I to get out of here spending more than twenty bucks, for food we ALWAYS have to finish eating later!  And what of the food? Five different types of meat can be put into the various things they offer, beef, pork and chicken of varying spice, and all of which are positively BURSTING with flavor. Having tried them all (a nice trick they will let you try if you are a newbie) I am partial to the barbacoa beef, spicy and pungent. The salsa bar has no fewer than six diffferent styles of salsa, all of which are unique and uniformly good (although I am partial to the hot green salsa). Guacamole? You want guacamole? You got it, exploding with chunks of avocado, tomatoes and cilantro. It is absolutely fabulous.  I am not easily impressed, although this review may make it sound like I am. I really don't go out ranting and raving about a place very often. In fact, I really can't remember the last time I did. But I plan on letting everyone within earshot know about this place, because I hope it stays open forever and ever. It's THAT GOOD. If you are anywhere in the vicinity, give them a shot. Go, now. Spend money. I need this place to hang around!"}
{"text":"I went in here with my 12 & 14 y/o sons after reading rave reviews here on Yelp. The staff was AWESOME to say the least - very polite and helpful, persuading us to try each meat and then build the dinner of our choice. My sons had quesadillas - one had the Barbacoa and one had the Pastor. they both LOVED them. I chose the tacos -  one chile verde, one Pastor, and one carnitas. They were all great with the chile verde taking the cake. They have so many fresh and tasty toppings and a wonderful salsa bar. I will warn you...the stuff that looks like onions with shaved carrots in it, at the salsa bar, is NOT that. I took a big spoonful and what I thought were carrots, were habanero peppers....it kicked my ass! ...and I LOVE spicy!   They did have flan and churros for dessert but I was too full to try them out...next time.  This place is 15-18 minutes from my house but the reviews pulled me in...and I'm glad I made the drive!   Oh yeah..the decor...crazy! But if you didn't know, Lucha Libre is a type of Mexican wrestling so the atmosphere is fitting to the name of the restaurant.   I absolutely loved it and will go back...SOON!"}
{"text":"Always deli pics, guac is on point and chips are perfectly seasoned. Tacos are a bit expensive but worth it."}
{"text":"I had come here looking for pollo with my friend or carne asada. This place doesn't have it. It has shredded meat soft corn tacos. They have 2 sizes small and large. The small are mini, and the large are regular sized tacos. I didn't understand the sizing at first, and ordered 2 small chicken tacos.  You can eat it in two normal bites. While the flavor was pretty good, at $2 a piece for the minis, I just don't think it is worth it, and I'm definitely more into the asada type or veggie tacos."}
{"text":"This place suffers from one of the worst themes ever! Luchadores? Really? The only thing worse that I can think of would be a video game themed restaurant. On to the food. The meat selection was good(the owner gave us samples of all of them). All stewed meats. No grilled choices.  I believe the beans were canned. Mass produced tortillas. In a town with some great tortilla factories I would have preferred to see a more traditional flour tortilla for my burrito. Salsas were good but nothing special. I got a wet/enchilada style burrito(don't know why but I was just in the mood I guess). I'm 90% certain that sauce came from a can as well. All in all. Average. I would assume most of their 5 star ratings are from their friends. Their meats deserve better!"}
{"text":"Good meats good eats. If you like spicy you won't be disappointed. Amusing decor. Did I mention they have great food? Because they have great tacos."}
{"text":"Maybe it was just a bad day for unflavorful beef. My first time here and it was very confusing. The staff were nice though. Clean place. I thought it was a bit pricey. The 3 large tacos didn't look large at all. So because of the lack of flavor of the meat and price, I'd give it a 3 star. I'll try them again to be fair."}
{"text":"¡Cochinita Pibil es caliente y muy muy delicioso!  Translation: why are you still reading this, come eat here right now. Grab yourself a few tacos, try all the meats and pick your favorites. I'd suggest the cochinita if you like spicy, or the carnitas if you like it mild. After your are full, come back tomorrow and try something else, it's all awesome food."}
{"text":"Fantastic everything authentic music, friendly service, and delicious food.! an absolute must try, even if you dont like burritos."}
{"text":"Let me just start off by saying that as someone who is Mexican American, I rarely am impressed by Mexican food restaurants, however, Santos Lucha Libre Taco Shop has revealed itself to me in all it's glory. The food is authentic, perfectly spicy, fresh and reasonably priced! They have a selection of 8 different meats with different salsas ranging from classic carne asada, chicken, pastor, to home style Tinga (MY FAVORITE) and you can combine it with your choice of either a burrito, tacos, nachos and some other things I can't remember. I got the three taco combo with Tinga, adobada and cochinita! MIND AND TASTE BUDS BLOWN AWAY! I can't get over how excited I am this place opened. The place is Lucha themed with amazing colors, paintings, disco ball, huge wrestling pictures that is perfect for families, kids, parties, maybe even to go after church on a Sunday with everyone. The tortillas were so soft and cooked just right and to wash down that hint of spice the horchata was just amazing and so authentic tasting as if my grandma just made a fresh batch. Go to Santos, you will not regret it."}
{"text":"Out of black beans and enchilada sauce, but mad up for it with the awesome burrito bowl, they made how i wanted it. I  be back for sure."}
{"text":"Every good Mexican restaurant should have a disco ball, wrestling masks and sparkly giant wrestler decals on the wall... the decor was awesome and kept my 4 year old in his seat looking around. The food was awesome, they had us sample all the meats and it was not an easy decision. They have a full range of heat in each meat type so lots of choices. I went with the mildest pork, I usually prefer more heat but the flavor was amazing, it was also not overcooked or dry.  Tons of fresh toppings, I piled mine high then hit the salsa bar for more. We all left with full bellies and excitement to come back again. It's obvious they care about their food here."}
{"text":"I came all the way from chandler to try the food and see what the hype is about. I had a wet burrito with horchata. The burrito was huge and the meat was so tender. They had so many healthy choices for tortilla. I had it with tomatoes basil tortilla. Horchata was homemade and I had to get second large drink. My trip was so worth it and I would recommend this hidden gem."}
{"text":"Amazing, friendly service right when we walked in. They let us try a few meat samples before we decided. We love the chicken tacos, amazing flavor! Awesome food & service & just a cool place to hang out."}
{"text":"iv been coming here since they opened and its literally the best food for miles and miles . the quality of their meat is top notch. they are family owned and operated which makes you want to help grow their business even more! i cant believe how fast they have so many reviews obviously im not the only one who loves this place."}
{"text":"Great food! I love that they let you try the meats before you order. It makes it easier to make a decision. I had the green chile pork quesadilla and it was excellent. Everything was very fresh and cooked right in front of me. This is a place that I won't mind turning into a regular stop."}
{"text":"Great tacos. They can be a bit pricey but the variety makes up for that. I haven't tried the burrito but it looks bomb. Definitely some of the best tacos in town."}
{"text":"Always great..can't wait until the bar opens..great value. I love that they let you taste the meats before ordering"}
{"text":"It was pretty good, but most of the meat was quite spicy.  They set me up with a couple of samples so I knew this before I ordered - which saved me from getting a whole taco that was too hot for me to eat."}
{"text":"Literally the best burrito I've had. They have you sample all if the meats before you order, and it makes it tough to choose! Ill be coming back to try burritos with all of the other choices. Amazing service too!"}
{"text":"My son and I shared the 5 street tacos. They have many different meats to choose from. Our favorite was the mild chicken. It's amazing. The atmosphere was clean and comfortable. We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Fantastic tacos and amazing people. This place is off the beaten path but I made the journey for my pregnant wife craving tacos. It did not dissapoint. They let me try all the meats and honestly the we're all incredible.  The best part about this place is it that it is everything you need and nothing more. Amazing selection of meats and simple delicious tacos.  Well worth the trip to find this gem."}
{"text":"Best taco place in az! We tried the carne asada tacos and i am pleased to say they were the real deal! delicious flavored steak and the salsa is also one of my favorites! The employees are always polite and so humble they make it feel like a traditional mexican family gathering everytime we go there lol"}
{"text":"Love supporting and finding new restaurants in my Sunnyslope neighborhood.  We  have ordered burritos and quesadillas with the pork and beef and they were delicious and they are made to order.....anyway you like! The owner is a hardworking Mom bringing the area great Mexican food....just like Momma's...step away from the fast foods and come support this great new little shop....I guarantee you love it and will come back for more..."}
{"text":"We came in last night because of good yelp reviews and we weren't disappointed. I had probably the best tacos I've ever had...ever! I tried my partner's wet burrito and it had the such a great flavor. She had a spicy beef and I had green chili, another spicy beef, and the mild chicken in my tacos. When we walked in the owner invited us to try their different meat options and they were all phenomenal!!!!! The medium salsa was my favorite. I loved the atmosphere....that whole strip mall is nice, with Scramble a few doors down, another great place to eat!"}
{"text":"Great variety of options for tacos, burritos, and more. Everything made to order. Guacamole was great!"}
{"text":"I don't care who else in Phoenix sells tacos... It's immaterial.  I got the 5-street, tried all the spiciest ones, and they were muy delicioso!"}
{"text":"Good stuff, authentic and different than the other phx taco shops.  It's earned a solid bookmark on my taco list."}
{"text":"This place has the best burritos and they are huge. They also have tacos and bowls but the burritos are too good to pass up. They have a wide selection of tasty meat that ranges from mild to spicy. If it's your first time they will let you try them all. They have a variety of toppings to add to your meal. The atmosphere and all of the luchador decorations are great too."}
{"text":"The only place for tacos. Second time here and it was even better. They are painting over the Mexican wrestling theme. But really that was part of the charm. If you don't know what something is they are happy to let you sample. Love the 5 small tacos so I can have all different flavor meats!!"}
{"text":"Shockingly Amazing!!  Found this place on Yelp and it met all the expectations set by the reviews.  Excellent street tacos and nachos.  Healthy portions of food and great quality."}
{"text":"Been going here for about a year. Great for lunch, great authentic mexican food, served by real mexicans. The tacos have varying degrees of spiciness, so if your into legit tacos this is your place. Still wish there was the wrestling theme inside the restaurant..."}
{"text":"Whoa! Delicious! Stopped in for a late lunch with my family. The meats have such amazing flavor. The staff was friendly and gave you tasters if you are a first timer. The Decor was interesting but in a good way. Very excited this place is a mile from our home we definitely will be frequenting this place."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere and great food. Chipotle is done, this place is my Mexican fast food staple now!"}
{"text":"A Sunnyslope gem! Great food, casual atmosphere, and a great value. Soooo many choices, you can make it how you like it. Not just tacos either- they also have burritos, tostadas, enchiladas, and quesadillas. The salsa selections are lacking, and they're still in remodel mode- otherwise 5 stars. Looks like they're building a bar with an outdoor patio that will have mountain views- so the future looks bright... I'll definitely be back! A must stop if you're hunting for grub in NorPho."}
{"text":"Our family loves this taco shop! They are super friendly and will treat you like one of the family when you visit. The food is authentic and delicious.  My grandson loves their horchata drink and carne asada!"}
{"text":"Went back again because I was craving some delicious Santos tacos. And also, on the insistence of my boyfriend... It appears that he is hooked! I had three of the regular tacos (carne asada,  chicken tinga, and barbacoa). He had an order of street tacos. I tried all the hot salsas, as usual (these have a decent heat level). I just laugh at some of the other reviewers who apparently have a significantly lower tolerance level for spiciness. hahaha Too funny! We timed our visit perfectly (during rush hour, during the week) because I hate crowds, and I will always try to avoid them so we can eat in peace.   Again, the staff was friendly and helpful, we had the place to ourselves, after the other couple left, Everything was perfect! My boyfriend didn't have enough, so we placed another order of street tacos to go.  * Notice all the photos up of this place from so many different customers? Yeah. There's a good reason for it. You have got to come see this place for yourself! It's seriously different, quirky, and interesting."}
{"text":"Loved all the fresh toppings and slow-cooked shredded meats. Tacos and nachos are fabulous!"}
{"text":"I love to eat here whenever I'm in the area. The owners seem like very nice people and are always helpful and friendly. They have the best churros I have ever had. Served with  a side of rich caramel. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"If you've ever wanted variety in your street tacos, this is the place to go. There were 10-12 different meats to choose from, including an assortment of chicken, pork, and beef. After choosing your meat, you top off your order Chipotle-style, choosing which toppings you want to add.   While we were deciding what to order, we were offered samples of the meats since there was no one in line behind us. Make sure to do this if you can as some of the meats are spicier than you might think. This was great for me though, as I love spicy food. My favorite meat wound up being the green chile beef. It was nice and spicy, while retaining a smoky beef flavor. I wound up ordering five street tacos, all with different meats, then topped them off with pretty much every garnish they had available. My hubby ordered their burrito (enchilada style), and it was HUGE. The assembling of our order was a little on the slow side, but the owner mentioned it was one of their employee's first day. We weren't in a hurry, so we didn't mind.   In fact, we were so not in a hurry that we didn't realize the restaurant closed at 8 and we wound up hanging  out in the restaurant about 40 minutes past closing time. The owners never said anything or tried to make us leave. As we left, we saw them in the other half of the restaurant (there's a wall that separates the ordering and dining areas), and we apologized profusely. They were very gracious and just thanked us for coming."}
{"text":"Yummy, yummy, yummy!!! The food is fresh, has great flavor and is absolutely delicious. The owner and her daughter are so friendly and very helpful, as this was my first visit, but definitely not my last!!!"}
{"text":"I loved most wanted taco shop! I am a vegetarian so I thought the options would be very limited but there was so much to choose from. I got a veggie burrito, it was amazing! The burrito was bigger than my head and it lived up to the other reviews I had read on Yelp. Don't get spooked by the look of the place, the food quality is unbelievable! The staff were so nice and helpful. I highly recommend coming to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Love this place. The meat is very well seasoned, various toppings which add to the seasoning and for the price you can't beat it.  I am not from here, but if I was, I would NEVER walk into another Chipotle. Do yourself a favor by eating good authentic tacos, eat at the Taco Shop. Your abuela ain't got nothing on this place. If I had a abuela, I would disown her!"}
{"text":"Overall this was a decent place, the portions are large so you're getting the bang for your buck. The burrito was HUGE."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Open burrito was amazing! Fish tacos are great. Great vibe too! Service was slow, but it think its because they became so popular so fast! They were very nice about it though. Really interesting decorations!"}
{"text":"OMG! Good. I never write short reviews, but I don't want to spoil your experiece. We tried to go here for lunch on a monday and were so disappointed that it was closed. We returned on tuesday and it was worth the wait! Quick service, great food!"}
{"text":"This place rules!! We found this place on yelp and the reviews were spot on. When we walked in the very nice lady behind the counter asked if we had been there before. We said no. She proceeds to give us samples of every single meat they serve. We should have brought a note pad. There were too many good ones. They have meat from the most mild to very spicy. We both got taco salads and they were phenomenal. When we were done my wife said \"you can go ahead and bring me here when ever you feel like it.\" It was great and we will be back. Great food and great employees!"}
{"text":"Delicious authentic Mexican food with great customer service!!  Mexican wrestling theme which is unique.  They also have the coke in glass bottles which I love :)  We go hear after hiking North Mountain."}
{"text":"Really great tacos here, and almost authentic... They accommodate Gringo expectations a bit here and offer grated cheese and lettuce and beans for their tacos, which are actually not typically found on street tacos \"en Mexico\".  But the meats and the tortillas are awesome, and it doesn't matter which meat- they are all fantastico!  Just say no to the cheese, lettuce, and beans.  :-)"}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican food I ever had in the valley. Quality and taste is comparable to $$$ and above restaurants."}
{"text":"This is the BEST Mexican food that I've eaten in Phoenix!  As a newcomer, they insisted that I try samples of all of their taco fillings.  Everything was muy sabroso-- intensely flavored, fresh, and a great change of pace from the usual fare.  Freshly made guacamole, your choice of toppings, and great tortillas!  Five street tacos are $7.50, and a great way to try several of the fillings. You don't need the salsas-- the seasonings are that rich!   Try the horchata--fresh, and more flavorful than I've ever had!  The \"small\" size is 20 oz, and worth every penny.   You've got to try this gem if you're ready to send your taste buds on an adventure!  The Mexican wrestling decor is a lot of fun, too.  The staff will make you feel welcome!"}
{"text":"Despite then saying their air conditioning is working, it is 93F in the dining area.  I think it is literally illegal for a restaurant to be this hot. At least the food is good."}
{"text":"Ahhhh these are the best tacos in PHX. I'm excited writing about it!!! So many meat choices and the marinades... Favors flows through the meat in every bite! Wish I can use the heart face emoji here... Seriously, stop reading my review and go try it yourself!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  The food is good and the Lucha Libre theme will make you laugh."}
{"text":"Outstanding tacos! Wish I could take them back to California. Great prices, variety and flavor. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We agree with everyone else on yelp and can't wait to go back!  Friendly staff and great food.  I don't have anything to add except you need to try this place."}
{"text":"Yummy in my tummy.   We found this place after looking for a Mexican restaurant on Yelp. I was intrigued by 5 star rating. I'm so glad we went.   When you go in, they ask if you've ever been there before. If not, then they ask if you want to sample their various meats. Say YES!  They have about 6 different types of delicious meat. The chicken breast was tender and moist. My husband really liked the barbacoa while I really liked the adobado. They both were spicy.   My husband got a burrito, but it's more like a burro. It was heavy and filling. It had the barbacoa meat,cheese, pinto beans, rice, onions, cilantro, guacamole, roasted corn and sour cream. They give you the option to omit any of the above ingredients. I had the super nachos with the adobado meat, and the same toppings as my husband had in his burro...minus the rice. The spiciness of the meat was tempered evenly with everything in the burro.  Come hungry or be ready to take stuff home for leftovers. The portions sizes were generous for the amount of money we paid. The nachos were filling, and I made my husband stop eating his burro to help me eat my nachos. The nachos were a lot for 2 people. They also selk Mexican cokes.  We're definitely coming back again for sure. I'm already dreaming about the adobado meat."}
{"text":"In concept, it is a lot like Chipotle, but with an individual feel instead of a franchise feel. The ingredients to choose from were very very good. The staff was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"They welcomed us to sample every single kind of meat when we first started. So yummy and great quality food. Really fresh ingredients. Yummy homemade not powdery horchata. Small to medium sized portions.   You first order up front (chipotle, subway style) then pay and take a seat.   Funky decor is kind of neat. Good place for casual dining.   Would give 5 stars but ran out of guacamole! :("}
{"text":"Awesome place! Food is delicious and fresh, chipotle ain't got nothing on santos lucha libre Mexican food!"}
{"text":"My lady wanted Mexican food, so we decided to stop by the place on a Saturday night.  I have been here before for lunch and had a good experience.  So we ordered the 5 small taco plate along with a casa asada burrito (enchilada style).  The food was super good and flavorful.  Everything was delicious.  I wish we would of ordered the Nachos though.  The table next to us did, and they looked amazing.  The meats were super flavorful and the sauces were great!  You order from a counter and they make it fresh right in front of you.  The service was good and food was awesome.   I would recommend this place for a quick bite to eat.  We normally go to Carolina's down the street, but glad we stopped by here."}
{"text":"Sooo delicious!!! Found the Mexican food of my dreams. Cochinita pibil and carne Asadas tacos combo with side of Guac. Yum! Will definitely make a stop next time I'm in the Valley"}
{"text":"OMG OMG OMG !!!!!! THE BOMB !!! Very rich in flavor and the portions are outstanding!  Damn hot sauce is actually HOT BUT GOOD ! everything is good here ..TRUST ME AND I KNOW TACOS !!"}
{"text":"wow just had the best red chili burrito ever and it was huge super soft had to be cooked down for hours to the spice was perfect just so your mouth is tingling and got nose just starts to run  but still all the other spices in it wife had the pastor carnitas and the asada. she thought the pastor was the better the girls that make your food there not as helpful as they should be I told them it was my first time they rely didn't explain anything to me and they weren't rude or anything just very dry inside looks like was a bar at one time but not in use now will be back very soon"}
{"text":"Unconventional and fun! The food is amazing! We will definitely go back when we are on this side of town!"}
{"text":"First things first, it's a lucha libre wrestling themed taco shop named after one of the famous Luchadors, El Santo.  I mean, their name and theme alone deserves 5 stars.    I heard there was great Mexican in Phoenix but this place is unreal.  All sort of options for vegans and vegetarians with tacos, burritos, bowls, tostadas, salads, quesadillas...it's endless.   Once you choose what you want, you then have the options of pinto or black beans or a vegetable mix.  I ordered 3 black bean soft tacos with lettuce, cotija, sour cream, guacomole and a bunch of other toppings.  There was definitely a rager happening in my mouth."}
{"text":"ALMOST felt like I was eating my grandmothers cooking it was so delicious! Everything on the menu sounded so good I wanted one of everything!!! But I didn't I got their barbacoa and ting they were full of flavor, cooked perfectly and exceptional customer service. My mouth is watering writing this review, I can't wait to go back and eat some more! BEST TACOS IN AZ!!!!"}
{"text":"I have to say this is as close as you'll get to authentic Mexican street tacos. The meat is tender,delicious and fresh! Tortias are on point!"}
{"text":"Wow, this place is amazing. I wish we had one in Maryland. Get the 5 street tacos and sample all the spicy meats, requires all toppings they provide. It's one spicy goodness, pain, my tongue feels so good!  Also love the design of this place."}
{"text":"Favorite go to in phoenix. Family O and O. Believe in keeping family run business going. Good food and good value.  5 stars if was closer to city. Always have to rent a car to get. So then my tacos become 50 dollar trip. Funny,  I do come here every time when in phx..may I should give 5?"}
{"text":"First time visit. First impression was the people were very friendly and helpful with my order.  Ordered 3 different style of small tacos. Carnitas, asada, and green chile chicken. The green chili chicken was my favorite, however all where very tasty. Also ordered a carnitas quesadilla that was super good as well.  I will visit this place again soon."}
{"text":"Delightful family run place, fresh and hot.  You can taste all of it first too!  Simple and low prices but likely the best and most authentic tacos I have had.  I had the 3 large taco with Carnitas, beef (something) and chicken vinegreta.  All three good but a little hard to eat bc they are so wet.  But loved them all anyway."}
{"text":"My husband found this place on yelp. We were vacationing from California and we were looking for a place to eat. Wow! Their food was delicious and the place was nicely decorated. The staff was super friendly!"}
{"text":"Amazing.   It was our first time and they gave us a sample of every single meat that they have. We each decided on the street tacos. The guacamole was fresh. Go here NOW!"}
{"text":"Friendly, great interior, and awesome food at good prices. They give you free samples of everything! I hope they survive the tough Phoenix restaurant scene. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The staff was very helpful in letting us taste the different meats prior to ordering. We got the 5 street tacos with mostly spicy chicken pork and beef. For the money, it's hard to beat and that was all it took to get full. The interior decoration is worth the trip, especially if you like Mexican professional wrestling ( or Jack Black's Nacho Libre)."}
{"text":"This place is legit.  The service is awesome, and the tacos were delish.  I had the three small tacos, chicken a la vinagreta, pastor and the barbacoa.  I will for sure come back for those tacos again.  Place is great."}
{"text":"Must! Must! Must! Go!  Super nice owner and staff.  Delicious food. Perfectly seasoned. Huge portions. Fair price.  Yummmmm!!!"}
{"text":"Really really good food. All the meats are so flavorful. Got the chicken tinga wet burrito which was HUGE and amazing! Very friendly staff, Will def be back. They do have a check in special as well."}
{"text":"Prior to heading to Peoria, AZ for some Padres Spring Training, We did some research by visiting the sweat lodge that is yelp.  While staring into the computer screen it was not a spirit animal that visited us, it was Santos Lucha Libre!  After reading the reviews, SLL was quickly bookmarked and a pact was made to visit this incredible find before heading back to Vegas.  While on our Cactus League inspired adventure, SLL was never out of daily planning.  Sadly, we could fit it in to our tight itinerary but after our bags were packed and time was timing was no longer an issue, we punched in the coordinates in OnStar and off we went.  Rolling in from Glendale was super easy.  I believe we arrived shortly after the normally scheduled lunch hour.  Parking was a breeze and inside we walked.  We were immediately greeting by the two gregarious employees behind the counter.  Before I could check out the menu we were presented with a multitude of pork, chick, and beef samples!  Everyone had a different story to tell and very, very tasty.    I went with the three large tacos presented on a corn tortilla.  My meats were a Tinga Chicken. Pastor Pork, and a Abobada Beef.  I left the toppings to genius of the man slapping it down behind the counter.  The condiments/additional ingredients can only be described as slightly similar to a Chipolte but better!  I enjoyed a lovely Horchata with my meal.  The Free Wrestling (Lucha Libre) atmosphere adds to meal and added much to the conversation pre and post meal.  There was not much talking while the Boy, GF, and myself ate, which is always a GREAT sign!  Just as high flying as Mexican wrestling is...so was the meal covered in colorful masks of taste and goodness!  Just as I look forward to seeing my Padres train next year in the Sonoran desert, I look forward to my next meal at Santos Lucha Libre!!!"}
{"text":"From their variety of meat flavors to their line of garnishes and toppings, there are so many ways to customize your taco flavor and experience here.  I usually get their 5 small taco order, as it's a decent size to fill you up and allows you to maximize the amount of flavors to try. After a couple of visits, my favorite meats include the pork in morita sauce and chicken in green chili.  Juicy and flavorful!   The set up is very much like chipotle with their taco assembly line, so getting in and out during lunch is quite convenient. There's not much of a crowd during lunch, and there's always tables/seats to dine in.    While the decor is charming and colorful, the restaurant's ambiance isn't always the most inviting.  A few times it was super quiet without music, and at times the room's temperature was a bit uncomfortable.  Overall I love this place for the quality, variety, and freshness of their food, and I think the restaurant has a lot of potential."}
{"text":"This place is yummy!  I had the wet burro with super hot green chile beef and red sauce. It was so big I took half home for dinner the next day. The place is tucked in the back of a strip mall on 7 the street 2 lock or so north of mountain view in north Phoenix. Scrambles and IL Posto."}
{"text":"This place is legit!!! Best tacos EVER..:we came in for the first time, nice heat and awesome authentic flavors.  Exactly what we were looking for.  Great value as well.  Samples for first timers a plus!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow - a hidden jewel in phx. A great mix of food, atmosphere and reasonable prices.  We found through yelp and needed Waze to navigate the 30 minute drive from Scottsdale.  Was well worth the trip.  Ladies behind the counter gave us samples of the meats in little containers - luv the carnes cita. I had the 5 small tacos (7.50) and my wife had the fish tacos for $8.99. With the tacos you can have a variety of meats if you like. They then top with cilantro, onions, cabbage, tomato, roasted corn and sour cream.  Two thumbs up.   The only disappointment was RC Cola in the  fountain dispenser but they had a great selection of Mexican bottled drinks. Something for everyone.   Well worth the trip and will come back on our next trip to phx. Thank you yelp community for highlighting this restaurant.  Also if you grab a copy of the local Sunnyslope Plus magazine/free paper they have a $1 off $5.00 or $2 off $10.00 order (June 2015)."}
{"text":"The food was \"okay\". Here is why it only got 2 stars: I don't like being interrupted every single time I'm trying to answer one employee question,  by another employee (I was trying to manage two orders for myself, and a friend). There was no line, not sure why I was being hurried. It doesn't help that they understand very little English,  and was asked 5 TIMES if I wanted cheese, after telking him \"one moment\", as I tried to finish the first order. The other thing that upset me, was that I was not told that the 9.00 DOLLAR NACHOS did NOT include guacamole ..and was charged an additional dollar for that...even after telling them I didn't want it! Service would better better if people actually listened to the customer."}
{"text":"First time and it lived up to expectations.  Conchinita pork was outstanding.  Everything fresh.  Great decor too (as it's name implies)"}
{"text":"Awesome food! Great atmosphere! Will definitely be back! We were given samples of the meat before ordering, which was great for our kids so they didn't end up ordering something they wouldn't like. The portions are huge! Five wee tacos or three large ones, humongous burritos, giant sodas. The only down side is they don't have a location in the west valley."}
{"text":"The best street tacos in town. I had the Pastor, Tinga and Adobada. I can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"This sure reminds me of the burritos in the Mission that I was eating in San Francisco in the early 90s.  Delicious ingredients and huge in size.   I will be back to try more!"}
{"text":"Over 10 varieties of chicken, pork and beef. Anywhere from mild to hot.  I had 3 small street tacos, and they didn't disappoint!  Staff was friendly and helpful offering up samples to try the many flavors.  Guacamole was fresh and delicious too.  Didn't try anything else, but would go back for sure."}
{"text":"The food is always fresh and delicious. The avocado sauce is spicy without losing the flavor. I've gotten the salad burrito bowl three times, twice with carnitas and once with the green chili chicken. Both were great. My office order from here at least once a week."}
{"text":"Awesome customer service.  They gave us free samples to try before you buy. Food was delicious!  My young children loved it.  We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Probably the best mexican food I've ever had.  Well done guys, you do it right."}
{"text":"Chose this spot for lunch because of all of the positive reviews they have been receiving and they definitely delivered! The food was fantastic and staff incredibly friendly and helpful. At no time did I feel rushed while they gave me samples of the meats. And their sauces delicious. I have a chipotle a block away from where I live and I don't think I'll be going there with this place just a few miles away."}
{"text":"There are few restaurants that one encounters in their lifetime that achieve a perfect balance of price, atmosphere, and quality of food. Santos is one of those Giants. It's a giant, shirtless, masked, beautiful, butterfly-luchador of a restaurant. I would eat there every day of an extremely happy life if I could. The veggie tacos were probably the best tacos I've ever had, and the service was fast and friendly. Stop reading this and go eat their tacos, bye"}
{"text":"Happened to stop in to this place by chance and WOWSA!! Delicious, family owned place. Super nice people and the food... OMG!! the food! SOOO good."}
{"text":"The service was outstanding and the decor very intriguing.  It was nice that they let you sample the meats before choosing, especially when you aren't familiar with them.  The food was tasty, we had tacos and nachos between us all.   Nothing I will dream about later, but good still the same and in a very unique environment."}
{"text":"Awesome!!!!! The food is great. The best Mexican food I've had since moving to Phoenix. Also, awesome decorations and great portions for a great price."}
{"text":"This was my first time to the restaurant. I ordered the chicken (tinga) quesadilla.  It was good.  It's not something I loved so much I'm going to crave, but it was fresh and flavorful.  I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Certainly one of the better taco eateries in Phoenix. The carne asada is tender and flavorful and the tortilla is slightly crispy to my liking. The sauces are a bit bland and the shredded pork was less than stellar. The portions are ample and the restaurant itself is clean and spacious."}
{"text":"OMG, I'm visiting from California, so I had to have some good Mexican food. When I walked in the lady served me up samples of everything. Beef, pork, chicken mild to hot. I got 3 large tacos the hottest chicken, beef and pork, that's how I roll. OMG it's so tasty, juicy and hot. Damn I wish I can eat more, I seen the burrito being made, no joke, no matter what you MUST try this place, I'll be here 3 more days, I'm coming back everyday,,,, ENJOY"}
{"text":"Soupy meats and strange atmosphere...  Not my kind of place.  Interesting flavors, but none that were really to my liking.  Not a horrible experience, just didn't like the food."}
{"text":"If you're not close to this taco shop, that's okay - it's worth the trip.  They saw we were first-timers and gave us a free sample of every meat they had. It didn't help us much as there wasn't a bad one in the bunch. We each got a plate of 5 small tacos and it was plenty. I wish I could tell you which ones we got, but after the nap we just took I can't remember. I know they were all tasty, and all on the bottom of the meat listings (the ones with the spiciest footnotes).  The decor is odd, but I really don't care - I'm going back for the food. Yum!"}
{"text":"We came in at 8:00 p.m. on a Sunday.   They were still preparing fresh food and welcomed us with samples. All of the meats were amazing.  I ended up with three different tacos.  I can't pick which meat was my favorite they were all excellent.  We're happy to have them near us and will be regulars."}
{"text":"YES. We came in when I was on a real nacho kick and these guys did not disappoint. The plate was huge, and a great value for only being about $8. The toppings were delicious, and they gave me the perfect chip to topping ratio. Also, the dishes were nicely spiced. There was a good kick without it being overwhelming and distracting from the rest of the meal. I also loved the look of the dining room. It has a trendy vibe, and the booths made it feel like a very peaceful dining experience away from other diners.  This place is awesome and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Loved everything but the guac and corn. Guac was nothing but plain avocado, it needed some flavor.  Corn wasnt bad, but I think a fire roasted corn would have brought my meal to the next level. Definitely will return."}
{"text":"Bomb tacos!! Best in Phoenix, that I have had so far. My taco quest will continue, but for now these are the best!!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best taco places in Phoenix! Everything is prepared with excellent attention to detail."}
{"text":"This used to be Lucha Libre but is now Most Wanted Taco Shop.  No idea why Yelp rolled the reviews over because it is not the same place other than the location.  Half of the building is under construction and many menu items are not yet available.  The food isn't the same nor are the employees.  It is still an order at the counter and sit down place but the salsa bar has completely changed and isn't near as good.  The food is okay. I tried the barbacoa, spicy pork, and carnitas.  The flavors were all very similar.  Nothing really stood out on its own. The toppings weren't as fresh as I would have liked.  They also knocked down a wall and half the place is a construction zone."}
{"text":"Awesome street tacos. We've been actively looking for a good spot for over a year. We finally found one. Great service. If you go spicy, you might want some horchata. I was humbled."}
{"text":"Best Burrito I've ever had. They have all these different meat choices, which they'll happily give you samples of and explain- THIS, however, makes it so difficult because each one is so amazing. You'll find yourself standing there, completely stressed and confused by the decision. HOW DO YOU PICK!? Once you finally reach a conclusion the rest is easy. The Burrito's are HUGE and VERY delicious and VERY reasonably priced. The service is top notch, very nice folks and you get to sit around in a freaking Mexican Wrestling arena-type-restaurant.   If you come here and don't have fun there are definitely some circuits missing from your motherboard."}
{"text":"Love the decor inside, I always wanna play the piano but I don't wanna get salsa all over the keys ROFLMAO. Srsly funny stuff, guys. Their food is great though, get in there before everyone else finds out how incredible their food is and they become too big to continue delivering their low prices, great quality of food and customer service"}
{"text":"Plastic forks and knives. Styrofoam plates. Dirty dining area. Meats are tasty, but you don't get much. No flour tortillas for the tacos. Tortillas didn't look house made. Most of what you get in a burrito is rice and beans. I don't know what all the 4 and 5 star reviews are for. This place is Sunnyslope on a plate."}
{"text":"Average five star user ratings can't be wrong! They hardly need my review but I was so impressed I had to add to them. The owner lady said it's too bad we're vegetarian because her meat stuff is apparently the best. Well, even the vegetarian options were excellent. I've never had a better vegetarian taco salad, and we also had a veggie burrito with a stupendous tomato tortilla."}
{"text":"This is nothing like Chipotle, the food taste way better, the quality of the food is great. This is the perfect example of eating in a moms pops restaurant. The atmosphere is awesome, the service is great. If you are looking for good Mexican food this is the place to go, you will not be disappointed. I would go out of my way to eat here that's for sure. I ordered the veggie bowl, since I am vegetarian, best bowl ever. It last me two days."}
{"text":"Review based on first time experience - place is really really good. Everything is fresh. The meats, and there are many to choose from, are well seasoned and so tender. The portions are substantial and make for a big lunch. Easy parking and friendly staff. I got a meat sample on the way in, and that alone was practically a meal. Very friendly staff, easy parking, and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"The BEST tacos I've ever had! No joke!  But...let's start from the beginning.   You walk in and the gentleman greets you and asks if you've been there. We obviously said, \"no\" and he starts handing us little cups of their meat. Starts from less spicy, all the way to the hottest. All amazing and full of flavor.  We got the 5 street tacos and added almost everything to them (not a huge fan of tomatoes)....every bite explodes with flavor that gets better each time!   Amazing customer service + great food = a winning combination! :) :) :)"}
{"text":"In all my travels I have eaten many a taco. This place is by far the best. The meat is fresh, as are all the toppings. The wrestling theme ties it all together, and I found myself staring off like I had ADD. I drove out from surprise to get to this place, and it was definitely worth the trek."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Food is to die for nice and fresh. You get a lot of food at a cheap price. The two ladies working are really nice."}
{"text":"I have never been treated with such disrespect by some dirty looking young man. I had to keep repeating my self with the lady that was helping me and she started arguing with me. He (who was not involved in the situation) was in the back and I had asked for the sauce on the side. She asked if I wanted it on the burrito. Back and forth a few times I had given up and said just do it how every you normally do it. I'm repeating myself and it's getting me nowhere. The kid then comes out and asks what the problem was, I just said she couldn't hear me so I stopped repeating myself. And he got all up set snatched my card away from me. This place needs to be seen by the health department. His hair was long and all of the place. What a dirty human. How could you have someone who takes no pride in themselves work for you and serve food. I'm so very disappointed. I come here regularly and the food is good but I will not be returning until something changes. I've referred friend after friend because they've always been so nice. Customers come first. Not your attitude."}
{"text":"They sample all of their meats except for the asada. They have so many! Creamy chicken, tinga, green chile chicken, barbacoa, asada, green chile beef, red chile beef, just to name a few, not to mention all the different types of pork.   They close pretty early, 7 on weekdays and 8 on weekends so I advise coming here for lunch. I came near closing and they were out of lettuce and guacamole. :(   I bought the three large tacos which weren't as filling as I had hoped so I'm going for the burrito next time. The meats I chose were: tinga (very flavorful chicken), barbacoa, and green chile beef. Their barbacoa was the best in my opinion, very savory and since it's not overseasoned you can taste the flavor of all the veggies.  I literally put all the vegetables on mine as well as cheese and sour cream. I also added their salsa to it which can be found on their silverware table.   They have beautiful seating and a really nice set up suitable for dates. Nice low lighting. Loved it, no complaints."}
{"text":"I'm no stranger to Mexican Food. I have never been as compelled as I am now to post a review just 15 minutes after finishing a meal.   Tacos are everywhere in this town.   You can go to gallo blanco and get the worst service ever and have a good taco. Or you could go to joyride where they wish they were gallo blanco or just be an Arcadia yuppie who comes to central phx and thinks taco guild is just the coolest ever...  Or instead just give Santos Lucha Libre a try.   I won't go as far to say don't bother eating here, like someone else may have...Food is super personal and everyone appreciates different flavors for different reasons.  For $7 for 5 tacos, it's dirt cheap anyway so if you're curious, check it out for yourself. Maybe it's just my controlling side which appreciates the opportunity to dictate my perfect taco combinations. I love when I can take full advantage of a salsa bar too.   Barbacoa, green chile, and al pastor were the meats I chose for tacos, one of the harder food decisions I've had to make recently. Green chile was delicious and topping it with the salsa verde was just perfect. Barbacoa was really good too. The crunch of the pickled onions and perfectly shredded cabbage made me lose my mind just a little bit."}
{"text":"Tacos are good, but not the best I've had in the Phoenix area. They are fresh and have some kick. The 3 large or 5 small deal for 7.99 is good, but I only needed 2 large with a side of rice and beans. Nice seating area and mostly self-serviced."}
{"text":"I thought, how could a place have all 5 stars. I went the same day I found them on Yelp to find out. It is similar to a Chipotle or Gadzooks in that they have a food line and you can see what's there while it's being made. Everyone there  was friendly. The lady offered to give us samples of the meat before ordering. They have quite a few to pick from. I ended up with 2 conchinita pivil and 1 adobado tacos. It was more than just good. It is a bit of a drive but I will be hitting this place on the weekends."}
{"text":"Great place! They had us sample the meat prior to ordering so we would know how spicy we wanted. The food was excellent. Service was outstanding! Loved the salsa bar idea. You can try different kinds of salsa."}
{"text":"I just L O V E this place!  This is one of the most authentic places I've been to yet!   I felt like I was in an old restaurant in Mexico!  I went with a large group and EVERYONE loved it!!  They have an array of salsas that can't be beat along with their tacos!  But watch out for the heat!!   they give you samples as well of anything you want!  AMAZING!  AMAZING!  AMAZING!!  I'll be headed back very soon!!  And I don't say that about a restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Had the five small tacos, churro, and Mexican coke. Tacos were tasty and fresh, churro was freshly fried crispy and a little gooey in the middle. Everything was good."}
{"text":"Other meat i tasted was ok but carne asada was the worst meat cut i have ever had and i am not picky at all.  I even lived in mexico for months. Eaten Mexican all my life.   Shredded meat is ok but carne asada was worse chewing than bubble gum.  Maybe thats the secret of this place.  Buy cheap meat and shreds it so someone can actually swallow without chewing."}
{"text":"It's a 5-star concept and execution with 3.5-star food.  If you have a bad meal at this place it's likely that it's your own fault.  They have 7 or 8 different proteins that you can choose for a base and you can try all of them before you decide.  I picked 3 for the tacos and after a couple of minutes of grill work we were on to the toppings.  You can choose from the staples of Mexican food:  cilantro, onion, tomato, guac, lettuce, cheese, sour cream, tomatoes, etc.  After that you can try 3 different salsas from the bar plus some limes and jalapenos.  What this place has is balance.  It doesn't overwhelm you with so many choices that you never know if you got the best choice, but it has enough choice where you can get variety.  Granted, it probably won't be the best taco you've ever had in Phoenix.  But you can choose what you want based on your mood, and it will be good.  I love salsa but some places go overboard by giving you so many salsa choices that you just end of trying all of them and deciding after-the-fact which one you liked best.  It's also a great place for a lot of different people, important if you have a diverse crowd.  You can get veggie options, meat options, salads, burritos or tacos, big or small.   Now for the other stuff...  The booth probably had the softest and most comfortable seat I've ever had in a booth.  I don't go around rating seats but it was so comfy I actually noticed it.  The table was very clean, and so was the salsa bar.  Free drink refills.  Napkins at the table.  Open seating area that's set apart from the grill area.  Clean floors, clean everything.  Very easy parking and very easy to find.  Friendly service.  Mostly middle class people eating at 5:30 PM.  You can pull tables together for a larger group or have a somewhat intimate conversation in a booth.  Prep is fast.  If you need to recommend a place for lunch with a larger group of people then this is a great choice.  Or just stop by yourself, grab 3 tacos, and make them how you want."}
{"text":"A new gem in Sunnyslope. The staff is very friendly, the food is really tasty and the servings are generous, and they offer you a taste of all the meat preparations available - all of them good, but seeing that the other reviewers have mentioned their favorite, I have to say that my personal choice is pastor. With the aid of the large illustrated menu graphic above the counter, you choose your meat (asada, chicken, carnitas, barbacoa, tinga, pastor, adobada, cochinita pivil) or green chili or fish and shrimp. Then choose the style: tacos, burrito, open burrito (served like a salad, with a large warm tortilla on the side), wet burrito (covered with enchilada-like sauce), nachos, torta, pambazo, tostada, taco salad, macho fries, or quesadilla.  The servings are generous and very filling and the items are inexpensive, but should you think that you'll have room for sides such as rice or beans, these are available at very little additional cost. The dining area, with high and low tables and comfortable booths, is completely separate from the counter/ordering area and both areas have a really fun luchador theme - I love it!  Restrooms are clean and there is a separate, large handwashing area just outside of the restrooms. Everything about this place makes it stand out over and above the countless taco restaurants of the city."}
{"text":"Just ate 5 different type of tacos and each preparation was as Nom Nom Nommy as the next! What a hidden gem near Moon Valley. Excited to go again!"}
{"text":"Just found this place.  Sampled all the meats from green chili to chipotle flavored.  Absolutely delicious!  This will be our go to taco/burrito place!! So worth the drive!!"}
{"text":"Came here for Cinco De Mayo! First off the gentleman let us try all the meats because we had not been before! All were very good but I would recommend the pork ones! Definitely a must go to place service was amazing and cool theme!"}
{"text":"Tacos and tostadas were incredible. I love how many meat choices you have.  From Louisiana so we love Spicy and they did not disappoint. Staff was very friendly. I definitely made a happy plate.."}
{"text":"I have at tons of Tacos and these were among the best. We drove 30 minutes one way and it was worth it!!!! Highly suggested if you like real and authentic Mexican tacos :)"}
{"text":"This place has amazing tacos . I have probably been to almost every taco spot in town and figured we would give this a try with such great reviews. I am so happy we did because this is by far one of the best taco spots we have found in phx.  We ordered all the shredded meats and tried 10 diff tacos total . They were all amazing . This is not your Carne Asada grilled taco spot so don't expect that kind of taco. This is marinated meat that has alot of flavor and many choices . Staff was so friendly and let us try all the different meat choices which made it hard to chose because they were all so good. I highly recommend this place . For those of you who left bad reviews just keep going to taco bell because you don't know good tacos"}
{"text":"We started out at a different Mexican place but sadly they had closed at 4. So back to Yelp we went. Came across this place and decided we'd give it a try despite having to drive a ways from our hotel. All I can say is WOW!! When we first walked in, she asked if we'd been there before and since we hadn't have us a taste of each different type of meat they offered. Every single one was delicious and full of flavor! I ended up with the green chile pork super nachos and the hubby got 3 large tacos. The food here is AMAZING and I promise you won't be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"New name but the same wonderful food.  I ordered a trio of pork tacos that were absolutely amazing. I do have to say that the cochinita pibil taco was my favorite. I added their avocado salsa that was marked medium heat and it was hot.  My daughter ordered the fish tacos. It was a big order and it included rice. She absolutely devoured them and said that they were the best tacos she had ever tried.  Next time I'll try a few of the beef tacos or perhaps the fish tacos."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a while, and I'm glad I finally did! The ladies working the line are awesome- they give you a sample of each meat on your first visit to help you decide and you can ask to have your food any way you want it. I had a burrito bowl with lettuce instead of rice and beans to keep it low carb, and once it was all topped and I put on my salsas of choice (at the salsa bar) it was a work of art. That and the nachos were both hearty and delicious. Can't leave out the decor- it's an experience to dine next to a luchador, not just lunch"}
{"text":"I always judge good tacos by carne asada and al pastor and both were  delicious.  Generous amount of food and toppings.  Unfortunately I was not impressed by their salsa bar.  I wish their salsa has more flavor.  Friendly staff and you can ask for samples before you choose your order."}
{"text":"Had lunch with a friend. I arrived first, and while I was waiting, decided to taste the different meat selections. They were all very good (Barbacoa, green chile chicken very tasty!). I ended up ordering fish tacos, and they were a perfect mix of hot, crunchy, spicy, cool and when topped with their guac, were absolutely DEVINE! Will be going back soon."}
{"text":"Came in for the first time and got offered to sample all the meats. Except for 4, all taco meats were quite spicy. Good service, delicious food! Unfortunately they were out on horchata."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place based on the great reviews. I love me some Mexican food and my favorite type is the hole in the wall taco shop. I'm from San Diego originally and moved to Arizona about 10 years ago. Typically I find Arizona taco shops to be awful. I find bad carne asada, tasteless watery taco sauce and bland gross refried beans beans abound, IMO. So, this place... It's very good. I had a carne asada burrito. It was massive and all the ingredients were very good and fresh.  My girlfriend had the tacos with the tinga chicken (shredded spicy chicken) and that was very good as well. The guacamole was good and it was only a 1$ to add to your item which I think is reasonably priced. The only thing that held me back from giving them 5 stars was the salsa. I tried both the red salsas and I found the \"medium\" to be weird tasting. The \"hot\" had some decent flavor and a decent amount of spice but it didn't blow me away. Overall this place is good and I will continue to go here and I would definitely recommend it to friends."}
{"text":"I think that one of the most important things at least  for me to  be a repeat customer at any place I eat is is good meat!! You must have great meat and it must be consistent and every time I eat here it's amazing!!!No fat in your food and nice size portions. Very friendly and happy environment. The best fresh Mexican food I've had in a very long time!!!"}
{"text":"Very good.   I had two small tacos with tinga and mild chicken, after tasting them all. The green chili taster was also very good, but you really can't go wrong with anything here.  I'd recommend getting the normal sized tacos because you'll get all your toppings in easier.  Amazing prices for what you're getting"}
{"text":"Wow, this is an awesome funky little taco shop! Great food with very generous portions, for a great price."}
{"text":"After eating here, I am still looking for the authentic street tacos that I've had several times on the streets of Ensenada Mexico.    The customer service there was great but I could easily tell that this was catered for more of the American taste buds as they didn't have tripa, lengua, or cabeza!  I had the Asada, which was kinda dry, bland and lacked the crunchy outside and juicy inside of a steak cooked over a hot grill.  The toppings for the tacos were also average at best. However, I will give props to the tortillas as they were pretty much as good as it gets.  Perhaps my expectations were too high so it's possibly worth a try to decide for yourself but for me, I don't see myself eating there again any time soon"}
{"text":"Now we're talkin.  Came back here with my brother here on a Sunday evening.  The Yelp hype has made this place a heck of a lot busier than it was last time.  This time I skipped the fish and went straight for the meats.  5 street tacos plus a side of rice and a small horchata all for $12.  I went with a different meat for each taco (carne asada, cochinita pibil, spicy chicken, el pastor, and carnitas).  Topped each with cilantro, veggies, and some cheese.  Absolutely fantastic and at a great price.  The menu is a little more organized and expansive than the last time I was here so it seems that this place has gotten in a groove now.  The staff was just as friendly and the setup was just as quirky as my first visit.  So yes, now I'm a believer.  Great tacos, great prices, great hidden gem.  Viva Los Santos!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today, the place had NO decor at all, two TVs that were not on and a light up sign that said clean up after yourself! The prices were higher than those shown in the pictures! Where you order is dismal and narrow! They make tacos when you order, tried 3 kinds, chicken being the best! The tortillas are put on flat top to warm, could not pick tacos up to eat they literally fell apart everywhere! 3 sauces are offered off to the side, the mild was so watery decided not to use, the medium so hot, should have been called hot! Didn't try the hot!! All in all not worth the long drive to get there! Hardly anyone there for lunch on a Friday, should have told us something! Staff was barely polite! Will never go back, and wonder how much longer they will be open anyway! Pretty uninteresting boring place! Really changed since the pictures, there is nothing on the walls!"}
{"text":"Incredible service, great food, and unassuming prices. This place was a gem. Well worth the drive into the Northern Phoenix area, and the restaurnat environment was fun and relaxed. Extra points for a deep soundtrack being played."}
{"text":"For the past few weeks, I have been on something of a \"taco tour\" of north central Phoenix. Santos Lucha Libre earned itself a stop on account of its (a) being listed as one of the highest-rated restaurants in Phoenix and (b) only being ten minutes away from work.  I'm not sure what I was expecting other than just great tasting, authentic Mexican street food. What I was certainly not expecting was a setup basically like Chipotle, where you tell the person behind the counter which meats you want, what you want on the tacos, etc. If you think this is how food should be prepared, you're wrong. Sorry, but you're just wrong.  Anyways, resigned to the fact that I would be forced to make game time decisions about whether I wanted lettuce, onions, sour cream, and/or guacamole, I ended up getting a few different varieties of meat on my street tacos.   Now, I'm not going to pretend that this was a bad meal. Was it disgusting? Nope. It was just average. The meat was average, the tortillas were average, the salsa bar was average... Everything was average. But it was presented in a way that makes white people who like the slop they serve at Chipotle think they're onto something special. It's like a better Chipotle, and that's not a compliment.  If you're offering authentic Mexican food, there should be more meat options besides boring beef, chicken, and pork. Where's the lengua and chorizo? If you want hole-in-the-wall food, go to a real hole-in-the-wall... And if you want fancy tacos, there are much better places to get fancy tacos.  There's really just no reason to eat here. Not when there are countless hole-in-the-wall Mexican restaurants in this part of town. Not when it's just a block down the street from Los Reyes de la Torta. Not when I have to drive right by the far superior Paquime to get there."}
{"text":"Yelp, you did me right. This place is simply amazing. On learning it was my first time in, I was offered a sample of every meat so I could decide which to have. Although, if anything, that just made the choice harder. They're all simply delicious. I picked 5 of the meats more or less at random and got street tacos. They were all fantastic."}
{"text":"The very best bean and cheese burritos I have had! We also got chicken tacos that were delicious. Very helpful staff and delicious food. I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff.  Love the samples for newbies.  Really diverse set of pork, chicken, and beef fillings. Flavors are complex and intense.  Also the wresting theme is cool. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great helpful staff that provided us w a taste of each meat.  All orders are custom made to your liking.  Flavorful meats.  Delicious entrees .  This will be my go-to place for all my taco cravings!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I recently moved nearby and saw this place while eating breakfast and made a mental note to give it a try. We finally decided to stop in today for some tacos sine he had a major craving. Omg! Foodgasm! They let you sample all of the meats first and the flavor of each one is great, spicy or not. We each got five small tacos (like little street tacos) and devoured them within 5 minutes. I'm leaving this review as I sit in front of my empty plate. The food is delicious and super reasonably priced. This place is a gem! Grabbing some extra tacos to-go for later..."}
{"text":"I heard all of the hype surrounding this place, so I expected to be disappointed...luckily, I was not.  We stopped by and brought our dog and the staff was nice enough to set-up a special table for us outside, so we could enjoy our lunch.  The staff allowed me to try all of the different meat options, so I knew exactly what we would like and order appropriately - love that!  I settled on a pastor bowl and a carne asada bowl for the hubby...wow, this place is sinfully good.  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"So first off, I have to commend them for all the different types of meat they carry. They have carnitas, barbacoa, green chile chicken, tinga chicken, carne asada and I can't remember what else. They'll also let you sample to see which ones you want in your tacos/burritos. i came to check this place out because of the low carb burrito bowl they have. For $8, you get a bowl with lettuce, cabbage, salsa, cheese, sour cream, and a nice portion of meat of your choice. I really liked their spicy green avocado salsa at their salsa bar as well. The tacos are small, regular street tacos and our friends that visited enjoyed theirs very much.  Here's the thing, this place is huge and plays no music, and has sort of a weird smell. It seems like they are trying to make it, and I enjoyed the flying pig deco, but having a little music or closing off half the dining room, may add to not making the echo-y ambiance so eerie. Overall, I enjoyed the food, had good pricing, sort of like a chipotle but more authentic Mexican... the place still has some room to grow though. I look forward to coming back soon."}
{"text":"Great service, very friendly employees. Defiantly coming back when I'm in the area. Carnitas are amazing"}
{"text":"Fresh, clean, great options, condiments, customer service & many booths in the back. Their tortillas are perfect! A must try for any foodie! We god the 3 meat enchiladas spicy. YUM!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here.  I remember seeing them at the taco festival last year and thought we'd give them a try.  They're really helpful when picking out what meat you want.  The girl gave us samples of everything to try.  After the fist few I lost track of what's what.  No matter what you get, you can't go wrong!   The only thing I would say is they need more signs to find them.  I drive down 7th street every day and I had no idea they were here.  I'll definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this taco joint.  My favorite was the 3 fish tacos which comes with rice.  Even the rice was good.  Everything was super fresh.  The burritos are huge and the tacos were delicious.   Def make a trip out to get some, finally, good Mexican food.  I forgot to take pics cause I started devouring it as soon as the food was prepped."}
{"text":"A taco place that has 5 stars with over 100 reviews? Obviously ... had to check it out.   First let me say, I don't know about the authenticity of these tacos. The corn tortilla was ok, the flavors of the meat(s) were a little off in my opinion and their spicy meats were seemingly ... a cover for bad quality meat.  However, $7 for 5 street tacos is a great place, and they have a large selection of salsas to go with these so you can be sure to find something you like.  They don't have the traditional meats, except for maybe Asada (carne asada) and Carnitas but the description is so bizarre that you won't really know what it is you're getting. But hey, they let you try the meats before you order so that's a plus. Fast, friendly service."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. We've had the burritos each time and they are delicious. You can pick your tortillas, beans, meat and toppings. The burritos are huge though so come hungry. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Have to try every flavor of meat here. Fresh ingredients, good portions, great price.   I am not a fan of Mexican food but Most Wanted Taco makes me want to come back for more. I am glad they keep the menu simple but offers variety of meat flavors. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I definitely recommend Santos Lucha Libre...I am so happy I decided to try this great little spot. I live right by them and am excited to have a great go-to when I'm craving Mexican with a slight twist.  I was greeted by a very nice woman with a great, inviting smile. (I'm assuming she's the owner.) she knew right away that I had never been in, and got right into giving me samples of all of the meats. They are all DELICIOUS! I opted for the 3 tacos (chicken, pork and beef) What sets them apart are the topping choices. I was excited to see roasted corn and pickled red onions, 2 of my favorite things. Never thought pickled red onions with Mexican, but it works amazingly well.   Not only was everything fresh, but the tacos were beautiful with the vibrant colors of the pickled onions and other fresh toppings. I couldn't wait to get home and dig in. Now that I'm full, fat, and happy I can say without a doubt I will be returning here more often than I would probably like to admit. Under $10 for 3 tacos filled to the brim and a soda? I could barely finish 2 tacos and will be happily wrapping the 3rd for lunch tomorrow. I can't wait to go back and try the other options! Highly recommend giving this place a try!"}
{"text":"First time here at first was wondering where to sit. Last time I was there it was when it was an overpriced burger barn. No seats where I expected to see them. But they took over the old sports bar space next door for more then window counter seating. Not fancy the sitting area still pretty much looks like it was left. Had three large taco special. They were good. I agree with the review i saw about the tortillas i agree I doubt they were made on site. The fillings were good decent salsa bar selection. Would stop by again and maybe try something different."}
{"text":"The overall taste of the food was great!  If you love your mouth on fire from spice this is definitely the place for you. If you shy away from spicy food then you might want to reconsider. They have a very limited menu of non-spicy food. Large portions and the service was fast and very friendly. We were getting soda and the fountain ran out of syrup, which they fixed very fast. Great customer service!! They do have thick tortillas and very flimsy pasticware which made it difficult to eat with. Also cheapo napkins so we went through a lot."}
{"text":"Super friendly service with recommendations for folks that are craving Mexican food, but in a rush & needed the eats to go! Love the pockets of commercial activity in Sunnyslope and have never been disappointed by a business in their 'hood.   Yes...great salsa bar, yummy tortillas and succulent pork.  Next visit won't be rushed!"}
{"text":"I stopped at Most Wanted Taco as I passed through PHX to see what all the Yelp fuss is about and I was not disappointed! MWTS has unpretentious tacos, friendly service, and interesting decor.   Walking in on a late Sunday afternoon, I was pleased to find there was no line, but they were out of asada meat. Sad times! We asked the staff what they recommended and were promptly offered a sample of ALL the meats (13 different meats!). Happy times! The lack of asada was immediately forgotten.  I ate the tinga chicken, pastor, and cochinita pibil tacos. Mr. P ate the cream chicken, carnitas, pastor, and barbacoa tacos. I added a few toppings, but kept them to a minimum to let the meat shine through and shine it did. Mr. P noted the three chilies to indicate heat on the menu did not exaggerate. Not enough heat to avoid, but enough to make you sweat just a little and crave a cold beer chaser.   My favorite taco hands down was the cochinita pibil. I haven't found this particular pork taco in any of the taco joints I've toured to date and would happily seek it out again if I find myself in the PHX area.  I'll agree with others that noted the guacamole is a little bland. The condiments bar with sliced limes provided just the flavor enhancer needed for my tastes.   Overall, the food was lip smacking good and worth repeat visits!"}
{"text":"An awesome selection of meats! When they say spicy, they mean spicy! Haven't tried one I didn't like yet! Amazing authentic green and red chili!"}
{"text":"My taste buds have just encountered perfection! The chicken flavor was awesome, but the beef OMG."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I go there every Monday.  The decor is fun and the food is delicious and authentic.  They let us sample the meats, they have a variety of flavored tortillas and you order Chipotle style, so the portions are HUGE. There's also a fresh salsa bar. On top of all that, the service is great."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!    I just moved here from Chicago, IL. And I live within walking distance of Santos Lucha Libre.  Coming from Chicago, I had a few local Mexican places that I loved and was hoping to find something comparable in Phoenix (I mean AZ is way closer to Mexico than IL, right?).  I saw that other review by a woman also from Chicago, and I wholeheartedly DISAGREE with everything she posted.  She doesn't know what she's talking about!  And boy was I glad to find Santos Luche Libre!  They found out it was my wife's and my first time there, so they let us sample the meats.  Oh man, each one was fantastic.  Some spicy, some smokey, all exploding with flavor.  My wife got the five street taco plate and I got the 3 large taco plate.    The flavors were amazing! The service was very friendly and the decor was bright with a Mexican wrestling theme. The Mexican pop music was decent and provided a great ambiance for our meal.    The salsa bar was really great, there were 4 different salsas to choose from, varying from VERY HOT to mild.  The VERY HOT was by far the most flavorful.  We both agreed that the two green salsas were the best.  The salsa bar also had limes available, which was surprising, considering the drought in California and the skyrocketing price of limes.    I'm very excited to be close to this restaurant and we will definitely be back, probably at least once a week!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered take out last night and we're excited because of the great reviews. We will NEVER eat here again. Both of us had the barbacoa and ended up with food poisoning. Awful!!!"}
{"text":"We came as a group of five sisters.  I had a veggie taco and enchilada which were so yummy.  I had everything possible on them except meat and cheese.  You can have a side scoop of guacamole for $.75.  One sister had fish taco plate which she really enjoyed.  The other 3 sisters shared 10 small assorted tacos and loved them.  We will come here again!"}
{"text":"When you stew meet in its own juices and your food is fresh it's hard to complain. But Not a huge fan of the name change but the good news is the food didn't change & no cherry coke seriously! Well with that being the only drawback this place is amazing. Up there with mucho macho and paqueme as some of the best local Mexican food I've had in the AZ. A must visit but be warned it will become a frequent craving"}
{"text":"Guess I'll join the 5 star review club on Santos Lucha Libre. My first visit was very memorable. They let my friend and I try all the meats since it was our first time. They were all very good. I had the barbacoa, green chile and el pastor. Very very good. The decor is hilarious. My only hesitation with their food is that it tends to be on the hot side. But very very tasty."}
{"text":"Great family owned spot - mom's home cooking. Lots of meats to choose unlike most places. Definitely get the horchata rice drink as well."}
{"text":"Wow-- this place is good. Need a taco fix? This is it!  We shouldn't have been surprised that all the meat was shredded vs. grilled or al pastor style but once the initial shock disappeared and my mind opened to a street taco concept other than what we were used to, it was game on.  If I could order a bathtub full of the barbacoa and then spend the next several days passed out in a tub of deliciousness, I'd be able to die a happy person.  They suggested a green avocado salsa while we were paying saying, \"you MUST try it!\" So we did. Yum. It's pretty freakin' hot, but when consumed in moderation adds a nice level of heat to the situation.  Looking forward to trying things beyond the tacos-- like an enchilada stuffed with green chili pork, or a burrito filled with the adobada. And I just might have to bring a bathtub next time... I suppose if I succeed, you'll know. Cheers!"}
{"text":"The street tacos are authentic and delicious! This is a hidden gem in Phoenix. When you walk in you are greeted with samples of all the meat they offer so you can decide what you like best (honestly they are all good). We have only ordered street tacos here but the burritos also look delicious. Fresh ingredients, great prices and fantastic customer service."}
{"text":"I have no idea if these are the best tacos in Phoenix as there are too many shops to even try in a lifetime. But, I do know these street style tacos are the stuff of dreams! The huge variety of meats are slow simmered and presented with an array of toppings and salsas to suit any taste. I prefer the chicken tinga, cochinita pibil, and beef barbacoa, all with cilantro, onions, cabbage, queso fresco, lime, and a mix of salsas. Their horchata and desserts are also made in house and often sell out before the end of the day; so, I recommend stopping for lunch if you're hoping for one of those."}
{"text":"We came here last night with a group of 11. Since none of us had come here before, one of our friends called ahead to make sure they could accommodate all of us.  They said they don't do reservations, but that they had plenty of seating and said they were excited to have us. When we got there at 6:30, surprisingly they weren't busy at all. They were able to give us samples for any of the meats we wanted try, which was  great since some of their meats that were labeled as spicy, were spicier than what I'm accustomed to. So definitely ask for samples if you've never been. I ordered the 5 street tacos, each one with a different meat topped with cilantro, corn, lettuce, tomato and sour cream. I also ordered a side of rice but unfortunately they were out of guacamole.  All the meats  were very good but my favorite was their carne asada. The flavor just stood out among all the rest. One of my friends ordered the burrito. Oh MY was it big! I've never seen anything that big before. I'll be ordering one those next time! They were a little slower than Chipotle. I just think they need to master the process of assembling the tacos/burritos/bowls and they're good to go!  I do have to say they have exceptional customer service otherwise. We didn't realize it, but they actually close at 8pm and our group stayed past 8:30. They didn't say anything to us and let stay until we were done which was really nice of them. All I have to say is another great find in North Central Phx =) ."}
{"text":"Best.tacos.ever! Hands down. I found this restaurant on Yelp and had to check it out.   The ambiance is crazy!! It is brightly colored and the decor is based on Mexican wrestling so it is very... unique. I thought it was funny and definitely different... but good different! I loved the Mexican music playing in the background!  The food was incredible. When my husband and I walked in, the people behind the counter asked if we had been there before. When we said no, they told us we could sample all the meat. I dont eat meat, but my husband jumped on the chance. Every one he tried was followed by \"oh wow!\" or \"oh god this is delicious!\" etc etc. He ended up getting a beef burrito and I got vegetarian tacos. It is similar to Chipotle in that they make your meal in front of you and you decide what toppings you get. Both of us LOVED our meals - and the guac was delicious! The meal was fast, inexpensive and awesome!   We cant wait to go back! Thanks Yelpers!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food, maybe 3.5 stars but it is clean and the staff is friendly. My son had a salad and I had three street tacos. Nice selection at the salsa bar too. Over all it's a strong 4."}
{"text":"There is a reason everyone likes this place. It's the fact that it's delicious.  Do yourself a favor and get some tacos. This is the place chipotle wishes it could become, flavorful, fun, tasty and cheap. 3.99 for three tacos full of delicious meats. But beware when they day spicy they mean it. I had wicked bad heartburn. But it was so worth it. I am Pumpkin Escobar and I approve this taco shop."}
{"text":"Amazing, authentic, some of the best tacos I've ever had in phoenix, and I've lived here my whole life. Sample each meat if it's your first time, they're all good so you really can't go wrong...but be warned, get the habenero sauce on the side, it's crazy hot!"}
{"text":"Saw the reviews and being a lover of tacos it was only right to try this taco shop out.....Was not disappointed :) also loved when we walked in they had us try every sample of all their meats which I thought was pretty cool and can't forget it's decently priced as well"}
{"text":"One of the most underrated taco shops in the valley! Great tacos, sauces, prices, and atmosphere! Encourage all to come and visit. Couldn't be more satisfied with the food also the staff and the two beautiful ladies who helped us!   Also if it's your first time you can try the meats for Free and taste what you want cause they do have variety!   Thanks Most Wanted Taco Shop!!!!"}
{"text":"Great service! I was able to sample every meat before deciding, which made my final choice even tougher. Worth the drive!!"}
{"text":"Great food, they let you try all the meats so you get exactly what you want. Some were a little spicy for my kids but they had plain carnitas and shredded chicken that worked great for them. Everything was loaded with flavor and the service was !Excellent! BTW I love the Luchadore Design. Price was low, quality was high. Best place I've been in a long time."}
{"text":"So many taco options, but everything I've had is delicious! You order at the counter; pick the filling from several different chicken, pork, and beef options, then choose fresh toppings like onions, cilantro, cabbage, queso, etc. (They also have beans, nachos, burritos, & quesadillas, btw) My favorite is definitely the red chile beef taco - but trust the four chile heat warning on the menu, it is spicy! Guacamole is legit, but you have to order the chips separately. The salsa bar is pretty subpar; a bland/basic mild pico, a spicy but otherwise flavorless hot red salsa, and a decent aguacate salsa. Luckily, the taco meat is so flavorful and perfectly seasoned that you don't really need to count on the salsa, but if you get one of the less spicy fillings, you might need to b.y.o.s. from home."}
{"text":"Being born & raised in Phoenix, I can say I've had tried Mexican food from literally all over the Valley.   And this little hidden gem is MY NEW FAVORITE MEXICAN FOOD JOINT. Period  If you've never been , Go.   Make sure you try all the flavors before you order.  And get the home-made horchata."}
{"text":"Another great taco place. Haven't had a bad meal yet. Staff is friendly too."}
{"text":"Great place - order at counter after taste testing the meats and preparation variations, ranging from mild to HOT.  Great salsas at a self service bar.  Im not much for Lucha Libre but whatever, they are I guess.  The neighborhood is spotty, somme blocks better than others buut that's part of the overall charm.  The place is decent enough, not dirty or anything.  This place is outstanding - I am reserving a 5th star because we had steak itmes and the carne asada wasn't much to brag about.  MMaybe our mistake in a place with so much carnivorous variety but we weren't in the mood for anything spicy.  We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Went here due to the Yelp top 100 rating. If you tell them it's your first time they will let give you like 10 different samples of all the meats before you order. The flavor is there, but they put a lot of juice or sauce in the meats and it makes your taco shells super soggy. My recommendation is to ask for your meat and shells separate and then make your own tacos at your table so that your tacos are soggy before you even sit down."}
{"text":"Awesome place. The taco very authentic for what you will find in Mexico. I stopped her for lunch on Sunday. Not crowded. Very clean. I had the fish tacos. They were excellent. Crunchy and tender inside.  You can top it with anything they have like cilantro onion cremation etc. I also had 3 small tacos: barbacoa, green chilli chicken and carna asada. The barbacoa was my favorite. Deep flavor and med heat. The others were great also..  Can't wait to return with my wife!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. It is easily the best tacos I have had in a long time. I want to come back and try everything on the menu."}
{"text":"Este lugar está a toda madre. Las carnes están muy sabrosas. Buena variedad y calidad, definitivamente un lugar que tienes que visitar si estás en Phoenix. This place is Amazing. I don't know if it's better than the one in San Diego CA  but it's worth going to."}
{"text":"My name is Mel and I'm a taco junkie... And I'm so glad I found this place while visiting Phoenix. The tacos are amazing and the woman who runs the restaurant is so warm and hospitable. I wasn't sure what to order so I took her lead and had the tacos  dressed as she would eat them. I'm so sad that meal is over and will be thinking about them the whole long way back to Florida."}
{"text":"Wow! Chipotle ain't got nothing on this place.. The only thing I didn't like was having to choose a meat because they all tasted so good! (Sampled them all) there burrito is unbelievably gynormous and their meats carry authentic homemade flavor. You can tell a lot of love went into this food! Very fresh, very good and very large portions. Also, the Lucha libre theme is pretty hysterical! Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"There is usually a good reason that a restaurant has high ratings. Sometimes its just the food. Sometimes the service. Sometimes its more...  Santos hits 5 stars across the board. I had been wanting to try this place out for months after reading about it on yelp. Finally went a few weeks ago.  Small place tucked into a strip mall on the west side of 7th street.   Its nicer than it looks in many of the pictures on yelp.   When you walk in you are greeted by the smells of tasty Mexican treats.  Were were great by a very sweet lady (possibly the owner) who asked if we had been in before. When we said no she invited up to sample all the meats before we order.   After tasting all the types f meat ranging from mildly spicy and sweet to quite spicy. I ended up ordering a few different types of tacos. Including the green chilli beef, the abodaba, and the Cochinita pibil (pork).  All were absolutely delicious and spicy.   This place is great and totally worth checking out. Not your typical taco stand...much, much better."}
{"text":"Seriously some of the best and most authentic food I've had the pleasure to try. The tacos are phenomenal as well as the burritos, taco salad, enchilada's etc. SERIOUSLY its all amazing and reasonably priced. Must have for sure."}
{"text":"So good. We are vegetarians so we got the tostada and burrito bowl. The best part of my burrito bowl was the flour tortilla- it was perfectly flaky and crunchy. The rice was tasty and soft, and the vegetables were crunchy and fresh.   Also, the young woman who served us was very helpful in explaining what we should order because it was our first time. She explained the rice and beans had no animal product, thankfully. Only issue was there was no guacamole, but she explained its because they make everything fresh and the avocados are out of season.   This place is cheap with great tacos that really fill you up. The seating is comfortable and they have a lot of space. A good amount of booths. Would definitely go back if I could, but I'm from Chicago."}
{"text":"Looks like it has potential, in a huge location, but on a walk-in no obvious cheap wins for kids, and menu overall looked a little pricey for a taco shop."}
{"text":"This place is so fun! The street tacos were amazing!  Not a fan of the burrito though.  Still the food was great!"}
{"text":"Great customer service, fun atmosphere and the enchilada style burritos are to die for!!"}
{"text":"This place is a little bit above average compared to all the Mexican joints in Phoenix.  Tried out Santos this week and we were somewhat concerned since it was prime-time lunch time 1 PM and there was absolutely no one. We got greeted by what seemed to be the owner and her son. We told her that it was our first experience at Santos and she allowed us to to sample their different meats, which was pretty awesome. I really liked their Barbacoa, however let me warn you that it is somewhat spicy, but good nonetheless. My best piece of advice would be NOT TO GET the carne asada, it is sitting in some sort of liquid and he just reheated it on the grill. NO BUENO. Get one of their other meats which are pretty flavorful.  Something that really irritated me was the fact that the son and ultimately the one that made my tacos, seemed to be on some sort of mind altering substance. He was notoriously slow and I had to repeat things 2 or 3 times because he kept forgetting. It really bothered me that when I asked \"What toppings can I put on my tacos?\" he said \"Everything you see is included\". Which to my surprise it wasn't, since he sneakily charged me for the guacamole right before I paid and without telling me. Their \"salsa bar\" is pretty MEH.  Overall A-OK place."}
{"text":"So good!!!  I've been hearing about this great taco place that I just HAD to try. I drive pass every day and finally decided to stop in. The service was great from the moment I walked in. A couple regular customers came in right after me and had all great things to say. It turns out the owner is someone I knew very well, but hadn't seen in decades. I grew up with her family and her mom's cooking! Her place smells and tastes just like her mom's kitchen!  I tried the green chile beef, barbacoa, and the carne asada. I highly recommend the green chile shredded beef (full disclosure: I'm a green chile addict).   Great little family owned/family run business in the heart of Sunnyslope! I am so lucky to have been able to share this great food with my family-who fell in love at first bite!! In tacos we trust!!   If you love authentic tacos as much as we do, you are missing out if you haven't tried this place yet!"}
{"text":"Delicious food. We were offered to try out the different types of meat as it was our first time. Great explanation and helps choose the right path with a myriad of options. Definitely a lot of food depending on what you order.  If we were local we would definitively visit again. Will have to add it to the list to visit next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Delicious! The meats have fantastic flavor. They insist you sample all of them. Great family ran restaurant."}
{"text":"Great taco joint, the owner is very sweet and make everything that day, ask her what is extra spicy that day before you order the usual because it varies. She will gladly give you a little taste, to make sure it's to your liking before you fill up those tacos. We visit this place frequently."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I don't know why haven't been here sooner. The food was delicious and the staff was very helpful. They let us sample all of the meat to decide which one we wanted. The restaurant itself is very clean. I love their theme! Very original. This place is authentic and trendy at the same time. I will be back for their tacos!!!"}
{"text":"12 options for meat all ranging in heat levels and types of meat. I sampled all of them and could not decide which one I didnt absolutely love. You cannot go wrong here! & I never say this after one visit but most wanted takes the cake! Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"So yummy! I haven't found anything that compares to my favorite taco truck in Oakland until now! They let you sample all the different meat and have really good toppings to your burrito and tacos. Come hungry because the burritos are huge! I had carne asada which was so flavorful. New favorite burrito place!"}
{"text":"My wife and I visited Most Wanted Taco Shop with high expectations, based on the Yelp reviews, and we were not disappointed.The taco fillings were fresh and there was a large variety. The staff was helpful and friendly. It was like a new improved version of Chipolte. I ordered the Tinga Burrito, and despite warnings from the considerate staff member that it was \"a little spicy\", when ahead with it anyway. I loved it. My custom choices of fillings and salsas only enhanced a throughly enjoyable humongous burrito. My wife ordered a trio of small tacos, one vegetarian and two green chile chicken. She said the vegetarian was best but liked all three. Ordering two small ice-waters allowed us to get out of there for a modest bill of $15.15. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Excellent-very clean-delicious meats and well prepared.  Neat set up.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Holy (literally) guacamole!!  I was in Phoenix for a long weekend and decided to pop into Santos Lucha Libre for lunch with my, very hard to please, Texas boyfriend. We absolutely loved the place! We both ordered the 3 tacos as well as chips and guac, all for around $20. The guy behind the counter was super nice and allowed us to taste test all of the meats before we chose which ones we wanted for our taco choice. In summary, very affordable Mexican food, a great place for lunch!"}
{"text":"Authentic and original! If you want something different but tasty then must try. They always give samples out before you buy so you can select the best choice for yourself. Great food and great price. This is like chipotle on steroids!"}
{"text":"Awkward place.  Ordering was fine but seemed limited but it was cool that they cooked right in front of you.  If it were just an in and out Taco shop I'm sure I would've been happy but when we went to the other room to sit down and everything's dirty and under construction it just takes away from the feel.  I'm hoping to update this once all the changes are done and it can feel clean and comfortable."}
{"text":"I'm glad I did my Yelp research on this place.  I wasn't expecting much for a Mexican restaurant in the Phoenix area because I usually have high expectations after reading Yelp reviews. This place came through! I had the street tacos which the variety of meats (free samples of each given at the counter) were each unique and full of excellent flavor. It was difficult to narrow the selection down to just 5 choices with like 10 to choose from.  The decor at the location was pretty cool. Not as fancy as the Lucha Libre place in San Diego but I'm sure they are run by different owners. Same style and same pride in the food they serve.  Good job Santos Lucha Libre!"}
{"text":"First you should know what this place is.  It's basically like Chipotle or Qdoba or maybe Cafe Rio.  Burritos and tacos (I only saw soft tacos, but maybe they do hard also?).  You go in, tell them what you want, pick your meat and fillings, and you're done.  What makes this place better, I think, is that they have more than three meats.  It's not \"carnitas, chicken, or beef\".  Well, it is...but they have several variations of each.  This is what sets Most Wanted apart from Chipotle.  Different flavors and different heat levels.  They will give you samples to try also.  They also don't skimp on the ingredients.  The burrito was so full they could barely wrap the tortilla all the way around.  The disadvantage to that is that it comes open easily and is difficult to hold.  Keep it in the foil or it will fall apart on you, peeling the foil down as you go.  It was big enough I took half of it home.  Another thing I like is that it isn't a mega-chain like Chipotle.  All in all, a nice experience.  Good flavors, generous portions.  I don't live near here, but when in the area this place will be on my radar."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Huge portions without spending too much ($9 fills a plate). Staff is super nice, as is the atmosphere (background music, cool art and photos on the walls)."}
{"text":"The selection process is a little different than other places,  as you get to sample the meats before you choose.  Me and my honey chose, carnitas and vinegar chicken on our 5 little taco plates ($7.70.) I got all of the toppings including corn and pickled onions.  He picked cabbage only.  The tacos were street sized and the meat was juicy and well seasoned.   I loved the pickled onions!  And will try the horchata again. It was homemade,  unlike many other shops. My only qualm, was the price.  Horchata + tacos = 11.00  We will be back soon, when we recover from sticker shock."}
{"text":"Yes, I definitely whole heatedly agree, 5 stars across the board.  Santos Luchas Libre is similar to Bajio (or Chipotle), but really takes the concept to a fine level. There are several more options to customize your meal, and the menu is much more authentic Mexican food. There is of course the Lucha Libre theme as well- colorful masked pro wrestling, and the bright colors and masks are abundant throughout.   When I entered, I was immediately greeted warmly by staff, and it seemed like they were possibly the owners. I was asked if I had been in before and I replied that I hadn't, so I was offered samples of about 6 different meats. I can't remember each one's description, but I do know that each bite was equally flavorful and delicious, with the chicken standing out slightly as being the most tasty.  There are many choices of how you want your meat served, besides burritos/tacos, like tortas or nachos. One thing that stood out in particular, is guacamole is only an additional 99¢. The ordering counter, cashier and fountain drinks are in one room, and after paying, you turn the corner to see a nice variety of choices at the salsa bar, and very comfortable booths in the dining room.  I got a chicken burrito with rice, pinto beans,  cheese, lettuce, and guac, on a tomato tortilla. They also had white, wheat, chipotle and spinach tortillas, whichever you prefer. It was delicious and I added medium red salsa to it.  Disclaimer- their hot salsas are actually hot. Like, too hot for me. I was impressed. And in pain after the green salsa. Oh my. Really though, *that* spicy! Ow!  Tip- 50 percent off 2nd item with Yelp checkin!  I will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"I love the tacos here. I am giving three stars because the last time I went, the service was awful. The place is like a Chipotle where you tell them what you want on your taco or burrito. I requested beans on my taco...the guy making my taco actually said \"tacos don't get beans.\" I was like, my tacos do. He refused to give them to me! Then, I requested a real plate instead of the mini styrofoam tray that they give you. He told me, \"no.\" While my friend ordered ahead of me, she was given a real plate for her food. I was like, is this a joke? I went back later to say something to the guy about it and he was glued to his phone. Then he tells me, \"my boss is here, that's why I didn't give you the beans.\" I'm like, your boss is here, that's why you refuse a customer's request and are glued to your phone?? Yeah, makes a lot of sense. Really disappointed with the awful service and it makes me not want to return."}
{"text":"I hope there is a good business reason to close at DINNER TIME everyday (7pm). 5 stars for the food , 1 Star for convenience. Great food and great choices. But my advice is \"availability is the best ability\". I would go 3 times per week if they stayed open later so I could eat dinner there after work."}
{"text":"This is the best taco place I've been to. Great people, I dont like the location but the food is worth it. You gotta try it at least once"}
{"text":"I  love this place- really good- fresh, semi-authentic Mexican faster food. Excellent Taco Shop!  Another reviewer mentioned the decor being tacky (what do people from Ohio know?... j/k). I completely DISAGREE- it's Mexican wrestler themed- fun, hip and trendy- The theme reminds me of El Carmen in LA. If only they served margaritas and beer they would be packed!  The people that work here (maybe the owners?) are very nice- they will let you taste all the different stewed meats. It's been a long time since I've gone to a Mexican establishment in Phoenix that actually serves spicy food. Yum! They do have a Chipotle assembly line style going on, but the food tastes much better. In fact, comparing them to Chipotle never even occurred to me the couple times I have been here until I read that in people's reviews- and I do eat at Chipotle on occasion- but I really don't think this place is anything like Chipotle at all. It's like a Taco Shop- most Taco Shops are set up in a similar style- perhaps you get more \"choices\" here in regard to \"toppings\"... I dunno. People are far too critical. Maybe it's because Phoenix is so white bred that the only Taco Shop experience people have is Chipotle, so, they assume that Taco Shops are copying Chipotle... what came first Taco Shop or Chipotle? Chicken or Egg? Plant or seed? Life's questions....  From one gringo to another, this is not an unusual set up for a Taco Shop- it's just a far nicer/trendier interior than an average taco shop- with very good service. Really, it's okay that they let you choose what kind of meat you want on your taco or burrito etc. and make it in front of you. It's probably a lot easier for them to do it this way since I have noticed that the guy working doesn't seem to speak the best English. Either that or he's really on \"drugs\" like some whitey wrote in a review... I think it's more of language thing than a drug thing... So, I will pretend I didn't read that other racist review that I read and found incredibly offensive- speckled with accusatory undertones because they were charged for guac. Give it a rest Güero!  I don't see anything wrong with the set up, wanted to reiterate that in case my point didn't come across earlier. It's a TACO SHOP...   Even taco trucks let you decide what kind of meat you want and what \"toppings\"... \"Toppings\" as if it's a pizza... lol!   Yelp irritates me sometimes... If they had a bowl full of spicy carrots and jalapenos you foodie snobs would be calling it pedestrian.  However, I think it would be nice if they served up some dishes with cotijah cheese, but I digress- Cheese may not have been a traditional element in Mexican cooking as many reviews here mention, but now days it's a staple. Take it or leave it folks, like it or not- Mexican places in Phoenix serve cheese on things. If the cheese makes the food generic- don't get cheese on it. Simple as that. I like cilantro and onions on my stuff personally. You know, most ethnic restaurants offer options to satisfy American palates- there is nothing wrong with the option for cheese. Someone wrote in a review- complaining that this place doesn't serve lingua... Serious? Big Whoop. There are Korean places in town that don't serve DOG- are you all gonna get on your Yelp Machines and start comparing it to... PF Changs or something, lol! Yes, I realize PF Changs isn't Korean, but it's not really Asian food eiether... Look, I'm being a Yelp foodie snob... Pot meet kettle!  I guess what might confuse some is it is almost restauranty, but still casual fast foody. I don't mind that- then again, I'm not one for manicured lawns and beige HOA tract homes. It's human nature to want to compartmentalize, label, file away... I have an over abundance of higher priority life mysteries to dwell on- I like the damn food- and the green chilies are smokin' hot! Nothing tastes bland. I also appreciate the option for cabbage rather than lettuce and I like their salsa choices- I don't mind not having an assortment of 20 different things (this is in response to other critiques). It's a TACO SHOP- I don't expect them to have 20 different salsas- but I do expect the salsas they have to taste fresh and good, and they do! They are also spicy- which gets me HOT!   Coming from LA, this place reminds me of some of the hip taco shops we had over there, just  tastier than many and much nicer/fun decor- really cute.   You have to try this place out- just don't go in there all hoity-toity expecting a white cloth dining establishment. Appreciate it for what it is- a good TACO SHOP."}

Chicken -tinga v smoky -vinaigrette outstanding, like khao man gai on a taco -green chile good   Pork -green chile v good, pork flavor huge  -carnitas v moist but a little plain -pastor great w warm smoky flavor -cochinita similar to pastor, but preferred pastor   Beef -asada unremarkable -barbacoa v good, sl acidic -green chile good, not as good as pork"}
{"text":"I hate to break it to you, but I'm not sure why this place has all the hype (#39 on yelp's 100). Maybe it was an off time, maybe it was an off day, but me and my group did not think this was anything worth writing home about.  I got the 5 street taco platter that was so highly recommended. Bacbacoa, Green Chile, Adobada, Cochinita Pibil, and Tinga (mixture between beef, chicken, and pork).  All of the meats resembled mush. Maybe i'm used to california and texas tacos, where there are real chunks of meat, but none of these were too satisfying.   On another note, it's located in the corner of a small strip mall, the waitstaff is friendly, and there's plenty of space for big groups. Overall, not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"Over rated.. Not impressed. Fish was not really fish.. Beware... But The employees were nice tho."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and I had the 3 tacos and 3 enchiladas.  The tacos were good, fresh and good flavor for a good price.  The carne asada enchiladas are not traditional enchiladas that are deep fried.  This is a much healthier alternative and have good taste.  I saw them make a burrito for someone and the portions are huge.  It is a huge burritos.  It looked like it would take me 3 meals to finish one burrito.  If you want to try healthy Mexican food with good taste and good price, come here."}
{"text":"This place has  awesome customer service, and decor. I love that they let you sample every single meat before you order. Most of the meat was very flavorful,  there was only one that was a bit dry. ..I think the pork.  Anyhow, I ordered a spicy chicken burrito and a torta. The burrito was GIGANTIC! The torta was regular in size. The only downside was both the burrito amd the torta were a bit soggy when I sat down to eat. I'm blaming this on all of the ingredients.  The second downside can't be blamed on the restaurant at all but my friend and I had a gas attack and he's still on the lou haha. I guess that's a tip...take some beano first if your stomach is a bit on the sensitive side."}
{"text":"Tried about 8 different tacos all different meats and it was just ok.  Yes, some were spicy but that was it, wasn't flavorful like I imagined from their yelp reviews.  Excellent customer service!!  Was given tasters of everything!  Blacks beans were decent...  I guess I was expecting more authentic."}
{"text":"Awesome burritos! The servers were very friendly and let us try like 8 meats before we ordered. I had a side of guacamole, And it was some of the best guacamole. Multiple salsas to choose from. I has mild and it tasted like fresh delicious tomatoes with spices. I will def be back."}
{"text":"We were brought to this place last night for dinner and wow were we impressed! We got to sample all of their meats. They have Mexican delights every which way with all the toppings and then some! The food tasted fresh and was perfect. Not to mention the place is absolutely festooned with Mexican wrestlers masks, states and posters. It's delightfully creepy!! Forget Chipotle, if you have the time, make the drive you will thank me! Ay caramba this place is mucho fantastico!!"}
{"text":"I went with my family that included 4 children aged 7-13. We were greeted with cheerfulness and an offer to sample the meats before ordering. Everything is prepared fresh and made to order. I ordered the taco salad with the pork chocinita (which has a smoky, spicy sweet with a hint of cinnamon taste)  and pork palo (a mild green chile), which is the best I have ever tasted. All of the children devoured their food which says a lot about the food. It is delicious!  The decor is fun and reminds me of the movie Nacho Libre.  A definite must if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Disclaimer, this place has nothing to do with Lucha Libre in San Diego.  I came here to try the tacos everyone raved about!  One of their best tacos was their fish tacos!  It was soooo good and crunchy, probably the best I've ever had!   The other beef/pork tacos were delicious.  The service is one of the best I've had for a taco place.  They provide you with as many samples as possible that you want.  So if you're not sure what you want, definitely ask for lots of samples to make sure you get the one you want!  I'll be back when I'm in Phoenix!!!"}
{"text":"Most wanted tacos are literally the best tacos/quesadillas I've ever had! I'm Mexican and trust me I know what good food is. They were all really friendly. The only thing I didn't like was when I was sampling the different kind of meats on my first visit there the lady taking my order said \"I'm going to start charging you\". Ummm excuse  me, this is my first time here. Other then that I really like this place."}
{"text":"I dont get the hype of this Taco Joint it's just an OK taco place. There's a lot more better tasting tacos that they sell in downtown in taco trucks AKA \"the authentic\" ones. Im from LA so i know whats good tacos, what's not & what's an okay one. There's nothing special on their tacos."}
{"text":"This was an incredible yelp find. All of the previous posts are spot on : the servers are incredibly helpful and friendly, the food was amazing, and the ambience, although goofy with all the masked wrestler decor, was fantastic.   Came with Girlfriend and we each got the wet vegetarian burritos. So good! Salsa bar was awesome too. Took the check in offer for yelp no problem. Will def go again."}
{"text":"Went for the first time today, pretty good.  The décor is interesting, not your run of the mill sombreros and chili peppers.  For first timers you are offered a taste of all the meats before you order which is nice! There are plenty of toppings for your taco and a salsa bar.  We also ordered chips and guacamole.  The guac was very fresh but compared to the meats for the tacos it seemed to seriously lack seasoning and I found myself dumping salsa and lime on it to try and give it a little zip.  The prices are very reasonable, but since this place is quite a distance from home and there are so many very good Mexican food places to choose from and nothing that really wowed me I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Love this place! Tortillas are excellent and are available in 5 flavors. So far I've had the open burrito twice. I can barely finish it. So much meat, topped with fresh lettuce, cabbage, corn, black or pinto beans, rice, pickled onions, onions, tomatoes and more. Great chips, too. Crisp and just the right thickness. The salsa bar is full of options as well. This one will be on regular rotation for a while until I've tried all the meats in the various options. So good. Like Rachel L. said, like Chipotle, but local! And with more meat options and more salsa options and just simply better."}
{"text":"Tried to see what the hype was about this place and drove 15 miles to check it out. Pretty impressive a business can have 4.5 stars with over 500 reviews. Parking is very limited in the place and I brought my 8 month pregnant girlfriend to eat here cause she likes tacos. It was 11:05 and the doors were still locked I knocked on the door and the people in there just looked at my like I was an idiot. Guess this business isn't prepared to take customers when they are supposed to open. Of course it's 102 degrees out with a pregnant lady so we down to the breakfast place which was very inviting musters and cold water outside. This company prob buys its reviews. Best of luck in your business. Maybe they should open at noon instead of 11 so they are prepared. The Italian place a couple doors down was wide open at 11 inviting customers in."}
{"text":"They totally deserve every star, I don't just throw around 5 star reviews, they earned it! Was in the mood for some yummy veggie tacos, but wasn't willing to spend much money. Also wanted to find a place that my friend who eats meat would enjoy as well. Was the perfect place for us! We came at 6pm on tonight (Sunday), and I was surprised to see that the restaurant was completely empty. The people working behind the counter were great, let my friend sample meats before she decided on the green chile beef. I of course got the veggie tacos. Also splurged and got some guac, chips, and a side of rice and beans. This ended up being a ridiculous amount of food and my friend and I were really full haha but totally worth it. I got everything that wasn't meat on my taco, except for the sour cream. It was so so good. Especially with the guacamole and salsa on top. My favorite salsa was the mild, my friend preferred the green salsa. She also said her green chile beef tacos had the perfect amount of spice for her, enough to be flavorful but not so much that it was overpowering. The chips were good strong chips, perfect for guac-eating purposes. Beans and rice were super delicious!  The decor is what made the restaurant awesome, I loved all the pink and glittery stuff. Record wall was awesome and the \"no nuts\" bathroom sign made us laugh. Also the music was fun! Atmosphere was great even though we were the only people. Loved this place, can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Holy hot salsa and hot peppers. The food was great and the service was great. Really nice people behind the table!! 5 stars as described"}
{"text":"Glad we tried this authentic Mexican restaurant for lunch. In the area for business and saw the ratings on Yelp so gave it a try. They offered us all the meats to try since we were 1st timers and it was all so good it was hard to decide. I got the 3 tacos with 3 different meats and was very happy. Will go again if I am ever in the area!"}
{"text":"Just finished my lunch! Very delicious tacos! If you like spicy food, this is the place to go. They have a large variety of meats in different flavors which is nice. I tried chicken Tinga, green chile chicken, and Red chile beef. All were yummy.  They are each served on two corn tortillas. What's nice is you get to pick your toppings for each taco. They have cilantro, pickled and raw onion, lettuce, cabbage, corn, tomato, sour cream, cheese, guacamole... Their salsas are good too, they had a small salsa bar past the register. I grabbed one of each, hot but delicious flavor. Will have to be back! I love tacos!!"}
{"text":"I tried the fish tacos and a bean and cheese enchilada style burrito for the kid.   The fish was perfectly cooked and tasted good. The extra toppings were fresh as usual. The salsa bar was a perfect complement to the tacos.   The burrito was a small football filled with beans and cheese. Topped with enchilada sauce. The sauce seemed a bit salty and the kid said it was gross. I liked it.  She ate the insides out and picked the tortilla apart to get the \"dry\" sections.   Staff was awesome as usual. The building was a tad bit warm on the seating side."}
{"text":"Santos Lucha Libre is estupendo!!  This is another little gem hidden in the central northern Phoenix area.  It's not far from another little gem, Los Reyes De La Torta.  Santos Lucha Libre is a very unique dinning experience with delicious food and friendly service.    First impression ~ \"Nacho Libre\" mixed with Chipotle, but I was wrong on both counts!  This place is decorated with loads or lucha libre mask, costumes and really neat artwork on the walls.  It's an \"eye - spy\" fantasy room that is done very well and yet entertaining.    Their food is served similar to how they do things at the Chipotle but they offer a much larger selection and it taste much better.  They offer asada, pastor, barbacoa, pollo, carnitas and a few other proteins you can have assembled into street tacos, burrito and on a salad.  I had the 5 street tacos with a asada, pollo, carnitas, pastor and barbacoa, some spicy and some normal.  You can choose spicy on I think everything, but the level of heat is pushing my limit so I mixed it up.  everything tasted great!  My son had a burrito and it was packed with asada and it must have weighed 16 oz. I bet.  It was huge!  He loved it but he couldn't finish it.    I've recommended this place to so many people and everyone that has tried it keeps asking me; \"when are we going back?!\"  I'm looking forward to going back again soon.  I hope to see you there!"}
{"text":"The food here is super fresh and delicious! They let you try all of the meats before you pick your meal. Everything is made to order like at Chipotle but with way more flavor and variety.   When we arrived we were STARVING, like DYING of starvation. No exaggeration. And of course we just happened to walk in after a group of like 9 people and they totally clogged up the works. After us was like four or five people so they became very quickly overwhelmed by the sudden rush of people. When we went to eat our food in the dining area, almost every table was covered with dirty dishes. I guess the people who had come in to eat didn't understand you're supposed to clear off your stuff.   Other than the service hiccup, I would definitely come back to eat here. The prices are great too!"}
{"text":"Solid taco joint.  Did take out for 3 Tinga, 3 barbacoa and 3 pastor.  Great flavors.  Tinga was the winner of the group!  Loaded is the way to go.  My daughter had quesadillas that were delicious too.  Line was out the door at lunch time, but moved quickly.  We will be back the next time we visit."}
{"text":"Best tacos in town!!! The hype is real. All the ingredients were fresh and delicious. There are three different types of meat you can choose from: chicken, beef, or pork. I had the five small tacos with asada, barbacoa, carnitas, pastor, and green chili chicken. The green chili was the spiciest for me. I could definitely feel that satisfying heat. Served in street taco style, each taco has two stacked corn tortilla with your favorite meat and toppings. I had the worker add everything to my tacos - best decision ever! I really do recommend trying the small tacos if this is your first time. This will allow you to have more variety with different meat and spice level. Don't forget about the salsa bar to add limes and extra salsa to your meal.  There is a large dining area with comfortable cushy booths. Service was fast and efficient. Eating dinner with loud Mexican music playing in the background surrounded by awesome decorations and great food - I'm floating on cloud nine."}
{"text":"I really loved this place. After the first time I ate there I was already wanting to go back.  When we got inside the female employee asked if we have been there before and we hadn't. She then gave us a sample of all the meats to try except for pork because I don't eat pork.  I loved all the meats and they all taste very different. I had a tinga taco and a couple carne asada tacos. They have tons of toppings. I had some pinto beans and rice on the side and they taste sooo yummy. I love that the beans are not cooked with meat, because a lot of people cook them with pork. Their horchata is very tasty and I cannot wait to go back. Love the upbeat spanish music, makes me want to dance I can't wait to bring my sisters and friends."}
{"text":"Omg! This place is awesome. I wish it had opened a year ago since I live right next door. The fish tacos are amazing, but I've sampled all their meats and its all good! Great prices, amazing food, super authentic, and it's quick! The owners are really friendly and the place is clean! Definitely check it out. Seriously I want fish tacos right now."}
{"text":"The meats are tender and delicious and they're happy to let you try them all for free. Second time here and another great experience. Funky vibe and great staff."}
{"text":"Flavorless asada. Soggy barbacoa and green chili pork that packed more heat than flavor.  The churro with caramel dip was good, but sorry...I'm not in sync with all the rave reviews here.  This taco shop is more trendy than authentic, and was simply not that good."}
{"text":"Wow, this authentic taco restaurant is legit! Aside from the cool & loco ambience, I have finally come across the mouth-watering street tacos I've been looking for in Phoenix, ever since we moved here a few years ago.   If it's your first time, let them know and they'll kindly give you a sample of all their tasty meats. And boy oh boy, are they tasty! So much flavor goin' on whether you settle for the Barbacoa, el pastor, tinga chicken or whatever!   I ordered a churro for dessert, but I had no idea there was vanilla creme goodness lurking inside. Even better!  All in all, you can't go wrong with amazing street tacos, excellent service, and a dining environment that reminds me of NACHOOOOOO Libre.   Definitely looking forward to coming back here regularly. Yes, their street tacos are that good, folks."}
{"text":"5 stars on Yelp?  Had to check it out for myself. I wasn't disappointed. The tacos were amazing. The meats are a bit spicy so beware. The decor is adorable as well. Definitely will be back sooner than later"}
{"text":"Excellent tacos!! The fact that they you sample everything helps a lot especially when going with kids."}
{"text":"Ive literally had this place bookmarked on here for a year. My boss raves about this place, and for some unknown reason I never made the time to try it....until this weekend. I can definitely say, for your first time in here, its overwhelming. They have like 12 different meats/flavors, its hard to keep them straight. I liked that they allowed samples first. My kiddo and I are picky. I told him we would try samples of mild options, and nothing with onions! Honestly, I don't even know what the heck I had lol, they were throwing so many names at me. I ended up doing the 3 large tacos, each with a different meat, just don't ask me what kind! My son had the quesadilla, which is huge. Total with tip came to 20 bucks. It looks like they are undergoing a remodel, it doesn't look like the pictures anymore. Staff was friendly. I would come back, just be prepared to be a little overwhelmed with options!"}
{"text":"I drove across town while visiting the area just to go to the most highly rated taqueria in Phoenix and was not disappointment. Fun and updated decor, very friendly taqueria taco maker, and very friendly tacos. The chicken street tacos were very distinctive tasting, dry in an excellent way.  The nachos were good, and burrito very good.  They need to put a wresting ring in, and have Friday night fights where anyone can create a wrestling mask and sign up to fight.  Although, I guess there could be insurance problems with this."}
{"text":"If you have never been here before, you have deprived yourself from an amazing flavor experience. From the moment we walked in we were greeted with smiling faces. Since it was our first time at Santo`s they had us sample all the meats from the mildest to the hottest. All were absolutely delicious and well worth the tongue burn when you got to the hotter end.  We ordered the 5 small taco plate which gives you a nice variety of meats if you choose to make each one different.  Each loaded with toppings however you like it. We also ordered the nachos which were piled high with delicious, fresh toppings including cilantro, onions, tomatoes, shredded lettuce, roasted corn, beans, and choice of meat. The decor is all lucha libre wrestling which gives the quaint little shop a bright, fun, and lively atmosphere to enjoy some truly great and delicious food. This is definitely a must for anyone in the mood for some great, great food at a good price."}
{"text":"Incredible food and value - AUTHENTIC   The meat tasting is fantastic - from mild to spicy   The owner is a sweetheart- so lovely and always so helpful"}
{"text":"Very good restaurant! Hidden in strip mall very friendly staff and food was excellent! Highly recommended we sampled all meats it is tough choice did green chili and didn't regret it. Support this local gem!"}
{"text":"This place is bangin! Tucked away spot with an authentic feel and traditional taste. 1lb burritos, street-style tacos, Mexican soda and smooth horchata.   We sampled all the meats beforehand since it was our first time. There were about 6 choices and all were exceptionally good. 4 of the 6 meets were pretty spicy but not so much to take away from the flavor of the meet.   If you love Mexican style food make sure to treat yourself here."}
{"text":"I had the street tacos and my husband had the burrito. Both were delicious and so filling! We were both very happy that the tortillas didn't break, despite the enormous amount of filling they had. The order set-up is like a Chipotle, but the food tastes OH SO MUCH BETTER. Also, the beans are vegetarian, which is a big plus for us. Decor is centered around the Mexican wrestler theme; kitschy and fun. Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Came in after discovering a flyer on my car advertising that this place guaranteed they have the best burritos in town. How could I pass up that challenge? At lunch time, had a little difficulty finding the place as it is tucked into a shopping center. Came in to find a clean, brightly decorated interior and friendly staff who spoke both English & Spanish. Behind a glass partition is a counter with tons of burrito and taco toppings and dressings that you can choose for your customized order. They have a very large selection- everything from freshly roasted corn, cilantro, pico, fresh chile verde sauce, cheese and some more uncommon findings.  My husband commented \"this is REAL Mexican food\". The set-up reminded me of a chain Mexican place starting with a \"C\" and ending in \"otle\", only with a much better selection. My husband got a pork burrito, I got a carne asada burrito and we also got 3 tacos.  Wow did we over order. I couldn't eat even half of the burrito, let alone a single taco. The price for the amount of food and the quality is amazing- unbeatable in my opinion.  I disagree with Yelps two $$ designation. I'd give it a $. My burrito was the size of a football- I kid you not. It had a good balance of meat to other ingredients. The tortillas were freshly made and the meat in our dishes was high quality and cooked perfectly. In addition to several options for burritos and tacos, you can find desserts like flan and churros. We will have to return for those and split a burrito in order to be hungry enough. I highly recommend you stop by and give this place a try. It will be my go-to spot for tacos & burritos in Sunnyslope. Even surpasses the famous torta place just a few blocks to the south along 7th street......and that is saying something."}
{"text":"Not only did Santos Lucha give me a fantastic idea for my costume this past Halloween they also serve up some really good tacos. I was very indecisive about my meat selections so they welcomed me to a full sampling. They line em up from mild to hot to hotter then hottest. I liked them all but I decided on the vinegar chicken, pastor and conchinita.  They really pack the tacos full of meat and give you a variety of toppings. I was full half way through my last taco. I'll be back for more."}
{"text":"Really good food.   My children each had a quesadilla with carne asada.  I had a burrito with carnitas which was excellent.  My wife had enchiladas three ways.  Everything we had was very good.  We are just in town visiting, but if I lived in the area I would definitely eat here on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Chipotle on steroids... This place blows comparable burrito places out of the water. I saw a sign for a 1lb burrito and they weren't kidding. Fresh quality ingredients, super filling, and very tasty. Cannot recommend this place enough! Definitely found a new taco joint."}
{"text":"This place is fantastically quirky with regard to decor and the food is excellent!  The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because all too often they are out of two menu items that I always get with my meal when they have them.  They are half the reason I like coming here... Flan and horchata.  Although I'm loathe to say this, for fear of it being even less likely they will have it when I come, everyone must try the flan and horchata!  They are both excellent!"}
{"text":"They finally lost the name infringement lawsuit filed in California. They are back open and now called Most Wanted Tacos Shop.   Don't panic! They are still FANTASTIC!    I can't get enough of the very spicy Morita pork tacos. So much so that I have decided to become a Sumo wrestler and these bad boys will be my ticket to get there.  -  I you feel this review is Useful, Funny, or Cool, please check the boxes below. Thanks."}
{"text":"First-timers get to sample the goods. & They are all good! Don't try to pick a favorite. Get the 5-taco deal and enjoy... Kiddo got a quesadilla and it rocked. Food is LEGIT!"}
{"text":"This is just like a chipotle but with tacos. They have very fantastic salsas and lots more choices. But all the meats come out of the steamer tray and they're all super moist and wet. Which makes for mushy tacos. Three tacos and a small drink is $10.70. It's a little overpriced but the ingredients are quality and it's worth a look. I think I would try fish tacos next time I'm here. If you just like dry Street tacos this is the place for you. Also the lady in front of me got a burrito size of my arm so if your hungry maybe that's the way to go.   I also think I'm biased because I live in Yuma and they have a different style taco and certainly they're way cheaper there. So that probably is why they got three stars instead of four."}
{"text":"Best street tacos I've ever had! Good prices. Staff is very friendly and welcoming. Cute atmosphere. I will be a regular here. Can't wait to take my boyfriend this weekend!"}
{"text":"It's called \"most wanted tacos\" now so it was difficult to find it but I may say it was worth the journey.  Best tacos I've had in arizona. Great seasoned meat and the staff was awesome. It was my first time there and the nice lady let me and some other customers try all the different types of meat before we made a selection.  Like others have said the 5 tacos is a great choice.  Got that with a side of beans and rice with an apple soda for 11 dollars.  Great price and great food!!!"}
{"text":"This place has come the closest to making the wet burrito that I love in Austin, TX. Fresh ingredients and SO MANY MEAT choices! They even let you sample all the different meats if it's your first time there. My favorite was the green chile pork and my husband liked the chicken tinga. The serving size was enormous as far as the wet burrito goes. There's also a nice salsa bar, though I did not need to add anything to my burrito... it was already so delicious! Seating is easy and clean. Their decor is interesting to say the least... you will see when you get there! Definitely will come back to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"This place is amazing and right next to my apartment. The gentleman who helped me was extremely friendly and helpful. He let me try the different meats and made suggestions of what condiments to pair with my tacos. The horchata is fresh made by the matriarch of the family, and it is amazing. So many meat choices and the ingredients are so fresh. I will for sure be back again and again, and I have been telling everyone who wants exceptional, authentic Mexican food to go here."}
{"text":"I went here because of the reviews. I have never seen 5 stars from everyone. Today was my dads bday. We LOVE Mexican food and this was AMAZING!!!! Everyone was right , spicy and delicious!!!! Nicest people work there, they were awesome!!!! I will send everyone there!!!,"}
{"text":"This is one of the best taco restaurants I have ever been to (and I have been to many).  Absolutely delicious flavors high quality meats.  Go for the smaller tacos and get more variety of meats.  So good!  Horchata was average though."}
{"text":"The food is great service was excellent-  the lovely owner offered us samples of the meat choices. Everything was delicious. Made it hard to make a decision on what to get."}
{"text":"I went back for lunch a few days ago. The name changed from \"Santos Lucha Libre\" to \"Most Wanted Taco Shop\". They removed most of the Lucha Libre memorabilia. However the food and staff seem to be the same. The food was delicious as always. I think they have eliminated their flavored tortillas, as I only saw flour tortillas out. But they are expanding! It looks like they took over the empty sports bar that was next door. They weren't finished with the work yet when I was there. They have an application for a liquor license. I'm excited to see what this will look like when they have finished."}
{"text":"super friendly and proud of their food, as they should be.  they encourage you to sample and explain their food in detail.  good depth of flavors, fresh, and everything from mild to spicy.  generous portions to say the least."}
{"text":"My wife and I found this on yelp driving through Phoenix. So glad we did! These are some of the best stinking tacos I've had. The variety of meats offered is quite the spread. We let the owner, who is the nicest lady ever as well as her daughter, know it was our first time and they let us sample the meats. Sample the meat!! Every single one tasted like heaven and we loved it. Every time I drive through Phoenix I will definitely be coming here. I pleaded with them to open up one in my home town. We got the 5 small tacos each with various meats. So amazing! We loved it so much we got burritos to go for dinner. Best taco shop I've ever had."}
{"text":"Easily the best, most authentic Mexican food in Phoenix. Take it from an L.A. guy who had almost forgotten what good Mexican food tasted like since I moved away. I almost teared up with joy when I ate here. I have brought over 20 people here since my first visit, and they are all loyalists now. Do yourself a favor and check it out."}
{"text":"At first I thought how could it have 5 stars with 300 plus reviews, I thought they might be fake, but they are very real! Luchadores AND delicious slow cookedeeats with a great variety of toppings, free tasting of all of the meats on your first visit, how could it get better?!!? BEER is how, and they were in the process of building a bar that had more than 15 taps! I only hope I am back soon after it opens up the bar!"}
{"text":"I liked the variety of different meats they offered although most of them were way too spicy. I got the barbacoa burrito my husband had the green chile burrito with all the toppings. The setup is basically like Chipotle were u tell the person what you want. The portion size of the burritos was huge and was barely able to eat half. Was it good? Yes. Lifechanging? Not really. I would come back because it is definitely better than filiberto's and their customer service is great. :)"}
{"text":"Amazing Mexican food right down the road from me. The meat is slow cooked and has sensational levels of flavor and spices. The staff are great and give you taste tests of the different meats so you can decide on your choice.   Will be back again for sure!"}
{"text":"A new favorite. Great welcoming staff. They are helpful recommending menu items and samples of great quality and great tasting Mexican Food. A new favorite. Try it."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite place for tacos now. Every choice of meat is excellently prepared and delicious. Whatever your tastes desire, you can not go wrong here. Highest recommendation."}
{"text":"This place is legit. If you want real Mexican street tacos then this will be the right choice for you. Caution to those who can't handle spicy food... The meat here is definitely not for the faint hearted!!! Your mouth will be on fire. Tell them it's your first time and they will let you try all the meats before making your selection--- highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. Servings were large and delicious. Loved the wrestling theme. Perfect for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"We were surprised upon rolling into the parking lot.  We noted that Los Luchas Libre's name had changed to Most Wanted Taco Shop.  We hesitated and hoped it was the same.  Much to our relief only the name has changed.  The same staff were present and the food is just as good as previously.  the staff recognized us as we mentioned we were hoping that had not closed their doors.   We have brought friends here and they love it as much as we do.  Prices are extremely reasonable even with a slight raise in cost.  Visit this place and you won't be sorry by the taste and staff.  Bring a new guest and they can sample the various meats being offered for tacos or burritos."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican and with a mexican wrestler decor.  Food was great and spiced in the traditional Mexican way a slow burn on the hot items.   Friendly service and I will be back!"}
{"text":"Really good, sure, but not go-out-of-your-way unbelievable.  Everything is fresh and prepared to order, and the variety of meats is very nice.  The atmosphere somehow manages to be a bit sterile despite all the Lucha Libre paraphernalia in the place.  Maybe we were there too late at night, with very few other customers, so our voices echoed, we felt the heat & air-conditioning alternately blowing at table, and the result was the feel of a big commercial cafeteria.  But still, the food was really good, casual, Mexican stuff."}
{"text":"I live in Scottsdale and I make the drive to Sunnyslope because the only guy I trust to work on my car has his shop here.   So when I wanted to grab a healthy meal this place came up with five stars! Really?!Naturally I had to see what the buzz was about.   I asked the woman who was helping me if she was the owner and she replied \"yes\".  She was very helpful and offered meat to taste and I declined, telling her I wanted to stay away from meat and she offered some great suggestions on what people who were eating vegetarian usually like to have.   Eyebrows raised with a smile when she said  there were no meat products in the pinto or black beans. She explained the concept of the bar is set up like Chipotle's. Now, I like me some Chipotle but I don't like being rushed through Chipotle's line.   I just felt relaxed here, the owner is very kind and knowledgeable and it has a great atmosphere. The food is so delicious, yum! In addition to the usual condiments you'll find they have pickled red onions, pineapple, cilantro and a variety of salsas which are seriously outstanding.   I really hope her business thrives because it's just a great place to come to. Anytime I'm in the area I will be eating here. I love to support local businesses, give it a shot guarantee you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I don't think I have ever scarfed so many tacos down my throat in so little amount of time before in my life. These were some of the best tacos that I've ever had. The meats are so juicy and have so much flavor, and there are so many to choose from. I love how you can build your own tacos and customize them whichever way you'd like, and if you're not sure which meats you want, they allow to sample each an every one of them. The servers were incredibly friendly, and the prices are great for what you get. Amazing food. Amazing place."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! Saw great reviews on yelp so stopped in since we were in the area for our kids soccer tournament. Gonna try to come back one more time while we re in the area! So good!"}
{"text":"Quite good street tacos with more than a few meat and condiment choices. Would return. Just look at this plate!!"}
{"text":"Greatest taco shop I've ever been to so many choices of meat  it's hard to make a decision great staff"}
{"text":"Amazing food and atmosphere. Meats are fresh and well prepared. Cocinita Pibil is phenomenal. Very friendly and inviting staff. I'd give them more estrellas if I could. Please open up in Los Angeles."}
{"text":"We went there on a whim after reading about it on Yahoo and loved it. They were so thankful we just stopped by and let us sample all the meats. It's a real simple menu and setup but the ingredients are top quality and assembled deliciously. Very inexpensive too."}
{"text":"Seriously good street tacos. The people behind the counter offered a sample of every meat. So quickly, in fact, that it was hard to keep up. All flavors were really good, but a few surprised us with their spice. One sent my 10 year old running for a water cup! One guy behind the counter gave her caramel to help ease the burn. Would've given them five stars if they had horchata. After all, horchata was the reason we chose Most Wanted over a nearby brewery. We will be back..."}
{"text":"Hey, finally!  A Mexican restaurant I actually CRAVE to return for their food.  Simple, fresh, delicious.  My favorite is the Al Pastor made just the way I want with the fresh ingredients I choose.  My wife loves their Pibil, Green Chili, as well as the Barbacoa.  Spicy!  For her the wet burrito is the way to go."}
{"text":"Amazing.  Best Tinga in Phoenix.  It's like if Chipotle was ran by your Mexican grandmother....zesty, fresh, delicious!"}
{"text":"BEST TACOS I'VE EVER EATEN. I wish I lived in Phoenix just so I could come here all the time."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try, it was delicious!  You can tell the meat is cooked fresh, if it's your first time visiting, they will sample you on the different meats available. Once you pick your meat, you can add any topping you'd like. They offer a wide variety of drinks. Overall a good place, currently being expanded. Great tacos!         (Desde sonora asta el df.oh chilangolandia unos Buenos tacos  Como en la central de autobuses de taxqueña  super Buenos !!!"}
{"text":"I've visited this restaurant several times.  The food is totally delish.  I've never eaten a bad thing.  I have tried all of the different meats and been happy with the varying degrees of heat.  I miss the luchadores they used to have displayed, but that's a minimal complaint.  The reason I cannot give it a full 5 stars is because of the prices.  In some ways the prices are totally inexpensive and make me want to come here every day.  However, if you want to change any item they either won't allow it or will charge you for it.  The chips are amazing, but they charge for them.  Actually, they over charge for them.  Guac is extra; whatever.  The last time I visited I got the enchiladas--which are totally NOT enchiladas--and they come with a side of beans or rice.  My friend wanted half a side of each and they charged him for two sides.  And speaking of their rice, it is not good.  It is plain.  It's not Mexican rice."}
{"text":"The don't take call in orders....bummer. Guess I'll take my order of 25 tacos for my corporate event some place else. #lostopportunity"}
{"text":"Surprisingly delicious! Doesn't look like a place I would normally frequent, but there is NO DOUBT in my mind I'll be back! I got the 3 tacos, 2 chicken and 1 beef (I don't eat pork) and 1 mild and 2 medium. I'm not sure which is which since I let them decide. The different spice levels are AMAZING! It's not the same marinade on different meats. They're all different and all tasty!!"}
{"text":"Not enough stars offered for how amazing it is here. Disregard any distance to come here. YOU WONT REGRET IT. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Service was great!  I got three different tacos and they were delicious.  Every employee was so nice.  I will be back!  They have SO many options of different meats!  Defiantly go try them out!"}
{"text":"I really liked the decor of the place; it had a bar atmosphere with super high ceilings and a lot of luchador decorations and murals. It seemed to be either under new management or just a renovation because half of the seating area (with a full sized bar) was closed off haphazardly with booths, and the name on the Yelp listing (how I picked to eat here) and in other reviews is different. Nevertheless, the food and service were both outstanding and I really enjoyed my meal.  I got three street tacos, each a different meat. They let you test them out before hand because they have a LOT of meat options with varying levels of spiciness (as indicated by the pepper graphics on the menu). You build your tacos or burrito with the ingredients you want a la Subway and everything looked fresh and clean. I wish I had tried out the green chili chicken beforehand because it knocked me on my butt. The el pastor and carne asada were amazing though. The asada was probably some of the best I've ever had from a taco joint. I also got a churro which was cooked for me on order so it was hot and fresh.  I definitely recommend this place if you're in the Sunnyslope area."}
{"text":"Not too impressed with the service and the food was \"OK\" I've definitely had better Mexican food for the prices they have. The service was not so good the lady in the cash register was rushing me out the whole time I was ordering. I had the carne asada nachos."}
{"text":"Still the best places around!  They had to change the name because of a copyright in California.  They sure didn't change the food though.  It is excellent.  There are 5 choices of meat, maybe more.... and legit vegetarian choices.  You must try this place. I wish they were open later."}
{"text":"Unassuming store front masks the size of the whole place, which is actually quite large. The restaurant is operated similar to Chipotle, order at the front then take your food and eat in the back. That's where the similarities with that chain stop, though. Their variety was amazing, the flavors tasted homemade, and the atmosphere was really laid back and cool.    Make sure you respect their spiciness ratings if you are just an average gringo like me. Their medium exceeds the hot rating I have found at less authentic places. I got their medium chicken, beef and pork and that was plenty spicy for me. So was their medium salsa, don't load up your chips with it like you would at any other Mexican joint. The ingredients were all awesome, and the value is pretty good too. Two sets of three large tacos, chips and salsa ran right around $20. Definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"Best tacos in Phoenix hands down!!! Their meat selection and salsa selection is awesome. Very authentic place. I can never pass up a trip to most wanted taco shop."}
{"text":"Seriously if you have not been here yet - get in your car and get over there. I went because it got good reviews, it was new to me and it was Mexican food which was what I wanted today. Big surprise - fantastic food.  The restaurant is not in a swanky neighborhood but don't let that stop you. They are in a shopping center that has several other restaurants, some closed, and a sports bar. Look for it because it is not obvious.  From the pictures on yelp you might think they do not have many tables BUT they have a room next door with plenty of seating.  The motif is Mexican wrestling thus the Lucha  Libre name. Pretty well done and fun if you have not been around that before.  OK OK, the food! When they ask you to try a taste of what they offer DO IT! every taste is different and every one is fantastic. The one they will tell you is the hottest  meat will in fact remove all of your throat so be careful. All of the other ones are normal hot to just mildly spicy. The green chili is superb but as might be expected very hot.  I got 5 street tacos with a different taste in each one.  And the very best part - one of the nicest women you ever met is the owner and she greeted me and made me feel as if I  had come home for lunch. I got a case of being macho and insisted on trying the really hot stuff and they ran to the  water cooler and got me water. Someplace else probably would have grabbed a cell phone and recorded me hopping around yelling about how  hot it was (hot but actually very good)."}
{"text":"Can't beat this place, multiple types of meat, multiple hot sauces one of the best burrito and taco places I have been to anywhere!"}
{"text":"There is a reason this place has 5 stars it is amazing. Tacos, burritos. All of it is amazing. Friendly customer service. Really cool atmosphere. Clean and comfortable. Great salsa bar. I am sitting in the parking lot writing this review. Wishing my pants were bigger super full. Great place just go there and eat. Sample the meats when you get there."}
{"text":"Living in Arizona You would think that there be more places like this.   Unfortunately NOT.  So when you stumble into a place like this you feel as if you found heaven.   Well maybe wrestling and taco heaven.  First thing you see  is the decor.  I loved it, as a kid I was a big wrestling fan. My grandma used to take me to all these matches and right away that brought me back in time.  But enough with the time machine.  How were the tacos??  OMG. Delicious.  They gave us samples of every meat, and they were off the chain. I'm not a spicy guy but even their spicy stuff had flavor. A lot of times is a contest to how hot you can eat. These meats use spice as a flavor kick.  I was very Impressed. One of the owners that served us was really helpful and friendly.    Take the time machine back to RC cola. That was a nice thing as well. Rare find.    I will certainly be coming back even though is 40 minutes away from my house.  It's a great day in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Customer service is great.  Love the ability to try different meats before ordering and all of the fixings are top notch.   I am not a huge fan of the meats, though. For instance, the al pastor reminds me of something that would come out of a slow cooker.  Not bad, but not the flavor and texture that I'm used to.  I will probably try it again and I'm sure others will want to go based on the reviews."}
{"text":"Awesome food at this little hideaway joint!  I tried their 5 small tacos, each with a different filling, for only $8!  Great deal, tasty dinner, and walking distance to my house! Win-win!"}
{"text":"Saw the good reviews and thought I'd check it out for taco Tuesday.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  They asked if we had ever ate there before.  After hearing it was our first time they gave us samples of all the types of meats.  I decided on the 3 taco platter.  I got one chicken, one beef chile verde, and one spicy pork taco.  The tacos were good sized, well priced and made to order.  Everything was delicious.  The tacos were great,  the salsa bar had several different choices that were each very good.  I really liked the spicy one made with peanuts.  I would go back in a heartbeat and look forward to trying more meats and possibly a burrito."}
{"text":"There is no place else in the valley I've found to have excellent tacos in the company of los luchadores.  I've been here twice and the only dissapointment has been that it has not been busier. Both times we dined with one other group in what amounted to an empty dining room. I hope this is because we eat at odd hours.  My favorite in those two visits were the fish tacos, though the chicken and beef tacos (spicy) were also excellent. I want to try their street tacos, but have not yet. We also have gotten the handmade guacamole on both visits. It takes longer than the tacos to prepare, but it is fresh and excellent.   I would eat among los luchadores more often if we just lived closer."}
{"text":"Authentic!! Tasty and vegetarian friendly mexican!!  Can't believe that we haven't been here before!!  Very friendly staff, guided is through the menu, gave a taste of the variety of chicken so the hubby could choose what he liked!  As for me(vegetarian), they pointed put everything that was vegetarian- which included the rice, tortillas and beans... Awesome!!"}
{"text":"Biggest problem here is Deciding between their awesome Tacos or the Massive Burritos.  The tacos have so much flavor and the Burritos are STUFFED."}
{"text":"The best. 5 streets were amazing. Staff was incredibly helpful. Also got a veggie burrito which was huge and amazing. This is a must stop if in the area."}
{"text":"Closed down for improper licensure. Disappointing. 10/15/15 @ 1pm. Drove all the way out just to try it."}
{"text":"This place used to be awesome.  The girls there would load up twice the amount of meat than chipotle would give for the same price.  Now they've got a guy who puts less meat than beans and says, \"it only looked like we put more before\".  Wow.  Huge disappointment."}
{"text":"The reason this places gets such great reviews is because the food is fresh and delicious!!  I have been here a number of times and the quality and price are unbeatable.   We shared 5 small tacos and a small side of guac and it was under $10.00. I got the barbacoa, and pastor with everything on them. All of the add ins are fresh and I especially like the corn. It's a crunchy, sweet addition to the taco.   I will be back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are trying out a bunch independent places in our new neighborhood. Based on the reviews we saw for Santos Lucha Libre, we knew it had to be one of the first ones we tried.   Upon walking in, we we're warmly greeted by the staff and asked if it was our first time. They allowed us to sample the different meats to make sure we ordered something we enjoyed - awesome! I got two tacos a la carte, one spicy chicken with lettuce, cheese, corn salsa and sour cream, and one spicy pork with lettuce, cheese, corn salsa, pineapple tidbits, and sour cream. My boyfriend got the three taco plate (a mere $6.99), and had two spicy pork and one regular pork taco. I also ordered a large horchata based on the Yelp reviews.  Everything was amazing! The horchata was so delicious, my spicy chicken taco had a lot of kick, and the spicy pork with the pineapple was just incredible. The meat is juicy and delicious, the toppings are all fresh, and the tortillas are slightly grilled before the tacos are assembled.  This will definitely be in our rotation for local joints to return to."}
{"text":"Update: I thoroughly enjoy eating here. But I think it's time you extend your hours!! Closing at 7 PM on weekdays is somewhat do-able, but 8 PM on weekends is ridiculous. Especially now that you have a bar!! Come on most Wanted!"}
{"text":"I've been here three times now. I've lived in Phoenix my whole life and this place has stuff on the menu that I've never heard of before. To me, that equates to \"authentic\", lol. This ain't Filibertos. They have a good dozen different meats to choose from and will happily let you sample all of them. The problem is there are so many you can't remember which ones were your favorites by the time you finish trying all of them. Everything I've tried so far has been amazingly good. The green chili pork would have to stand out as my favorite so far. The salsa bar has some serious heat as well so watch out. I was a bit shocked to see that a burrito is nine dollars but it is an engineering miracle and quite a challenge to finish. In other words, nine bucks buys you one monster burrito."}
{"text":"I only have three words for most wanted tacos and that is \"Most Amazing Tacos\"! I absolutely love this place the tacos are so tasty and filling. I recommend anyone who is craving tacos go go here."}
{"text":"This is the second time we have been here and it is delicious! We keep getting the 5 street tacos, and the super nachos with half and half meat so we can try all the amazing meats they have. The employees are very nice and patient. My 1 year old loves there black beans and decorations. She's quiet and eating and we can actually enjoy our meals!"}
{"text":"Be forewarned: The yelp check-in coupon was \"no longer good\" according to the cashier. What a crock!  Now onto the the juicy stuff. My husband and I have been wanting to try this place out for a while since we went to San Diego and fell in love with a similar concept taco place called \"Lucha Libre Gourmet Taco Shop\" (I wonder who came up with this idea first?). Any who, we were greeted immediately and were several samples of the meats available to help you decide what you want to order. I thought that was very cool! Hubs got to try various meats and the one that won him over was the pork green chili. So he ordered a burrito with all the fixings and I ordered a veggie taco salad. The total bill came out to 18.00 with two drinks. Not bad. I was disappointed that the check in coupon \"no longer worked\" for whatever reason. Good thing I was too hungry to care.   We went straight to the salsa bar. They had cut lemons, jalapeños, cilantro, and four types of salsas: very hot, hot,  medium, and mild. Since the mild was empty, I was only able to try three. They were good except the hot. It was a red one that tasted like dirt. My taco salad was excellent! It had crunch, spice, and flavor. My favorites! My husband said his was delicious and super spicy. Definitely lots of delectable food here. We are probably gonna come back.   The eatery is not that big but its decorations are loud and bright! So much glitter too. I would recommend this place if you're in the area and want to dine in a room that resemelbes a bit of Mexican strip club."}
{"text":"The decor...LOL. I don't get it at all.   Never the less. lets begin:  This place is like a cafeteria/chipotle style ordering and food preparation. You order go down the line. Customize and then pay then eat.  They let you try all their meat they have. Their spicey meats have a great kick to them. Unfortunately some meats were a little dry.  Out of all the meats the green chili pork is the best.   I had the burrito it was ridiculously huge. Like a chipotle burrito. It was way better tasting. They have good fresh ingredients. and some that can really pack a punch (in spicyness.).  I would like to go back and try their other menu items. They have potential, but the location is kind of crappy. Hopefully they will do better there than their predecessors."}
{"text":"Be warned that the ultra-cool and delightfully charming lucha libre décor  has been completely removed. Since this place was a near carbon copy of a concept that was copyrighted in San Diego (name included), they were forced to completely re-brand. I originally thought they were going to overhaul the entire place, but it looks like they've kind of just given up on redecorating. You're stuck eating tacos in a sterile looking dining room. Although the decor is gone, the taco taste thankfully remains.  I've always been a big fan of the tacos here. They used to allow you to sample the meats in order to reduce the risk of making any mistakes. They've since eliminated this and I've had to update my review as a result. Many of their juicier meats are extremely spicy, so I advise you to be careful. Aside from a few desserts (including some good churros), that's pretty much all they have. But at least what they do have, they do exceptionally well.  I would like to point out that they do seem somewhat disorganized. The last time we went in, a guy was behind the counter just giving us what appeared to be a \"death stare.\" It took a few minutes of awkward silence before the lady, who usually takes our orders, told us that he could help us.  Their tacos are still very good and most of the reviews you see on here are accurate - even if I desperately miss their old wrestling theme."}
{"text":"Um, I mean, Most Wanted is good, but, I don't understand the rave reviews on here and praise from Eater?  Honestly, this is just a slightly better Chipotle with more variety.    I'd go back, but would never go out of my way to get here."}
{"text":"food: small beef and pastor tacos. the tortillas were average. tastes like store bought. the meats were no better. everything tasted bland. the pastor was a bit better, but you cant really tell the two apart. the guy packed my tacos with plenty of toppings. the horchata tasted watered down. ***2/5  service: it's mostly self serve. the area is large. for a near 5 star place, i was surprised at how empty it was. maybe thats how phoenix works, works for me. the place is clean and you can get all the sauces you want. ***4/5  value: the tacos were smaller in size than most. each taco was at best 3 bites and for two dollars each...no. if it's good, ill pay for it. ill throw money at you. this was not the case. ***1/5"}
{"text":"WOW! I found this hidden Gem today!  I am gluten free and when I mentioned that, the woman helping me was very knowledgable about what choices were gluten free. And because it was my first time there, she gave me samples of the different meat choices! The decor is fabulous, I love the unique atmosphere and the corn tortilla tacos were excellent! I will be returning and hope more people find and support this restaurant! Choose a local business over a chain. Check this place out, you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Excellent excellent food here, a great scene, friendly owners, fun music, great theme, clean bathrooms, and did I mention the food was excellent? You should get off your phone and get here now (and this was only my second time here!) - love it!!"}
{"text":"The.Best.Tacos.Ever  Seriously do not miss out on this place. I'm so glad we did - they have like 15 or more meats to choose from with all the right fixins. The waitress even let us try the ones we were interested in! And.... FREE LOLLIPOPS! Yay :)"}
{"text":"What a great little find (thanks, Yelp!)!   The staff was incredibly nice and gave us samples of all of their meat options upon learning that it was our first time in the shop. I liked all of their options, some more than others, but you can't go wrong with any. Their spicy options definitely have kick, but lots of flavor, as well!  I went with the green chile beef, creamy chicken, and chicken a la vinagreta. Their choice of 3 large (6\" tortillas) or 5 small (4\") tacos provides a nice way to sample a bunch of meats! It s one of the best meals we had in Phoenix...and one of the cheapest!  Overall, delicious food, phenomenal service, affordable prices, and nice atmosphere leave me with one rating option: 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Great little family run restaurant with quite possibly the best street tacos I have ever had (40+ years of testing)! I ordered the 5 street tacos with one of each (pollo tinga, carnitas, barbacao, asada, and adobada) filling, and all were equally amazing (get them with the works). My wife got the taco salad with chicken and raved about it too. She loves salsa and they have a great little salsa bar (beware of the green! It's hot! ). The whole place is a shrine to Lucha Libre wrestling and is funky and fun. I only wish we had discovered it sooner!"}
{"text":"When I still lived in Cali I had heard rumors of a Lucha Libre copycat in Phoenix and naturally wanted to see how it matched up with the real deal. Well, by the time I moved to AZ it had changed its name and lost its place in my mind. Fast forward to today, I'm in North Phoenix for work and remember the place so decide to stop by for lunch. I walk in at 12:30 and there is literally no other customer there which didn't bother me at all ;). Ordered a taco salad with barbacoa beef, chips and horchata. The meat was juicy and tender but not too overbearing. The lettuce, cilantro and corn complemented it well. The horchata was homemade I believe as you could taste it. I also enjoyed their salsa bar -- not as many options as I thought they'd have but their avocado hot salsa was so bomb. Only reasons I lowered this review to 4 stars are: a) ain't no way you're getting away with trying to copy an SD legend and b) there needs to be additional renovating done to the interior. They have plenty of space and even a bar from the old adjacent space they took over, but have failed to obtain a liquor license. Soo many missed opportunities here. The good news: I will be back for their awesome food and hopefully by then things will look less like a cover-up job on a once-attempted imitation.  PS: about the food -- come HUNGRY! The meal I ate had me running 5 miles at the gym tonight just to make myself feel better about the massive size of my lunch! XD"}
{"text":"Friendly atmosphere, outstanding customer service & some BIG ASS delicious burritos!  Better than the competition!  We will bring our friends :-)"}
{"text":"AMAZING Music!!  Looking for Rock en Espanol? Cumbia? This place will be a great night club.   Food is delicious! You can't go wrong with any of their meat choices! With $20 two people can eat and still have left overs for another meal!   They are working on getting their liquor license. Once they have it, it'll be worth the drive.  P.S. They use to be \"Santos Lucha Libre\""}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Mexican restaurant in Phoenix. Delicious stewed meats - tinga, pastor, barbacoa, and more to be added to tacos, burritos, or nachos. So fresh and with great toppings. Plenty of veggie options too. Everyone in my family loved their meal - even the picky eater! A very nice family owned business with cool decor. I wish there was one in NYC! Every time I visit my family this will be my first stop."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch on a Sunday after a weekend of watching spring training Cactus League baseball in Mesa, AZ.  The location is a convenient Phoenix strip mall location.  The first thing you notice is the wildly colorful lucha libre decor, with dressed mannequins and posters everywhere.  Very interesting and creative!  Great picture taking opportunity.  The ladies at the counter are very nice and they offer you samples of the meat.  If you can't take the heat, it's a good idea to ask them for the not-too-spicey ones.    We got 5 small tacos, 3 enchiladas, guacamole and two drinks for about $20, what a bargain.  The food was very good, too.    I would definitely come back here if I were to make it to spring training again."}
{"text":"Most Wanted Taco gets all the stars and more!!!! I was blown away! Such a great local owned spot, with owners who take pride in their product! So glad we found this gem!!   When we walked in, one of the women asked if we had been in before, and when we said we hadn't, she gave us each a fork and started filling sample cups one at a time, letting us sample every.single.meat they offered! Without us even asking. She just really wanted us to taste everything. I can't even remember the last time I had such awesome welcoming service!   They have several types of chicken, beef, and pork, with several different levels of spiciness in each. After they add the meat, you can pick what other toppings you want - raw or pickled onions, cilantro, cabbage, shredded romaine, cheese, sour cream, corn.   I had two small tacos (on corn vs. the large on flour) - one creamed chicken and one carnitas. The creamed chicken was so tender and super spicy (rated 3 chilies, their hottest) and even though my mouth was on fire, it was amazing! The carnitas were tender and flavorful and when you order, they take it from the hot line and put it on the grill to crisp it up. Authentic and delicious! I kept my tacos simple with cilantro, pickled onions, and sour cream and they were perfect! Everyone in my group loved their tacos!!!   The only thing that wasn't off the charts was their guacamole, sadly. It was pretty bland, needed a little more salt and/or lime.   There is ample seating, which is super nice! I'm bummed I don't live in the area, because I would be back on the regular!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful. We went based on yelp reviews and we're not disappointed. Fun and funky interior with great food."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food. I wish there was a place like this where I live in Southern CA. Found this place last year on a trip to Sedona. Took a detour last night at Flagstaff when I was driving home from a trip to Colorado. Arrived at the restaurant a few minutes after closing. Explained to the staff that I drove down from Flagstaff & they kept the kitchen open to make my burritos. Can't say enough good things about the food & the service."}
{"text":"Good food at a great price, and obviously the vibe/decor is fun, but the service here was lacking. Only two people were working tonight (7pm on a Saturday) and there was a long line that moved very slowly. The dining room really needed to be attended to and have tables wiped down, but no one checked on it during the 45 mins or so my friend and I ate and talked, even after the food line slowed down and we were the only people left there. Aside from the service it was a fun little trip up north, I'd go back next time I'm in the area, I just hope they're better staffed!"}
{"text":"First off.. Best selection of meats i have come across thus far in Phoenix, i have lived in downtown area of phoenix for a few years and i have not encountered a better variety of meat selection. The tacos are amazing! deff sample the selection before eating. the sauce bar is great also. best bang for your buck in central phoenix always love having taco Tuesday here!   The Carnitas, Pastor, Asda, and the Tinga by far are clutch! amazing staff also. Big size portions come with your dishes plenty of left overs!"}
{"text":"Awesome good tacos!  Wanna come back soon for burritos and enchilada that table next to us had.  Full favor experience and go with the works."}
{"text":"Everything Here is Amazing! The lucha libre theme is so original and well done...and the Food!! So fresh and authentic!! So many different flavors...so many different ways to eat...new repeat customer!"}
{"text":"I went to the MWTS on a Saturday afternoon.  You see, I just relocated to PHX and am desperately searching for some decent tacos!  I settled on this place after reading all of the great reviews. First, this place is fun.  It has a luchador theme complete with glittery painted luchador faces on the walls, and a mannequin in full luchador garb attached to the wall looking like he's ready to body slam you while you scarf down your grub.  The down side is that it appears that the shop bought the parcel next door (a former bar), tore down the wall, and are slowly looking to covert the parcel into a bigger dining area for their customers.  When I got my food and walked over to sit down in the original dining area, I could see the large garbage cans of construction waste and random tools laying scattered all over the floors and bars.  It also appeared to be a dirty operation so I wondered how clean the actual area I was eating in was. When you arrive, you order Chipotle style, picking your meat and then all of the things you want on your taco.  There are tons of items to pick from and you can end of making a pretty colossal taco if you pack enough ingredients in it.  A lot of the meat is stored in big, liquid filled vats while other meats are cooked to order on the grill.  I decided on the 5 mini tacos (3 carne asada, 2 al pastor) and watched the el pastor get pulled out of one of the vats.  Then I waited about 5 minutes for the carne asada tacos to be finished (they were grilled to order). I took my seat and was so excited to eat my newly assembled tacos.  Unfortunately, the meat was very bland (no seasoning at all on the asada) and the al pastor was just meh. Super wet, shredded beef, and no pinapple like traditional al pastor tacos have.  Fortunately, I had piled on a pretty good amount of delicious toppings that made up for the lackluster meat selections. I would return and try this place again if I was in the area and had no other options, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come back."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place for lunch and was very pleased with the result. Once the owners found out it was our first time there they let us try every single type of meat they had and made fresh batches of everything too! I loved the variety and the workers were friendly and informative.  The decor was clean and fun."}
{"text":"Local, family owned and operated authentic Chipotle.  Only better.  Pickled onions, cabbage, and a large variety of meats.   The family that runs this place are so nice and kind.  Support local and eat here!  The food is awesome.  Cochinita Pibil is yummy! Did I mention to \"eat local\"?"}
{"text":"Tacos here were awesome! They were full of flavor and nice and spicy from the chili flavoring invoked in whichever meat you choose, chicken, pork or beef!  Simply delicious and satisfying the only problem currently is that they close pretty early now (8pm) but I am sure that will change as  soon as they arrange to expand and have their bar area up and open within a few short weeks."}
{"text":"Wow, Just amazing. My hubby and I decided to go thanks to Yelp. We shared a quesadilla and then each had street tacos. The Guacamole is AMAZING. All was fresh and the ladies behind the counter were very helpful, especially since we said it was our first time. We got to taste all the different kinds of meats to choose from. I would recommend anyone go there."}
{"text":"Amazing service, and delicious food. The flavor of the food was wonderful. Each bite packed a punch of flavor. I highly recommend taking the time to enjoy a meal at Santos Lucha Libre, you won't be dissapointed."}
{"text":"Upscale chipotle very fresh made to order in front of you   Had the wet carnie  Asada burrito. Good hot hot sauce :) my date had the bean burrito & loved it. Don't like plastic forks  & they don't offer ice tea.   Limited menu    will go back."}
{"text":"The place lacks ambiance and character, but the tacos are wonderful.  We go their every once in a while. Prices are good too."}
{"text":"Don't quite get the wrestling theme, but the decor is very eye catching and Macho I guess.  Love the chandeliers and sparkly touches every where.  There is plenty of room and the booths are super comfy and private due to their high backs.   Now the food and service: like other reviewers mentioned, the owners let us sample the meats which really helped with choosing. The woman who I presume is the young man's mother was also very nice and accommodating.  I prefer pork to chicken or beef therefore I got a spicy pork taco.  The black beans were perfectly cooked, not too dry, not too soggy, I asked for them well drained and did not get the usual dirty look, he said \"of course\" and carefully drained the black beans before placing them in the flour taco.  I also ordered a vegetarian taco with beans, guacamole, corn, pico, cheese, and sour cream.  The two tacos I had were so filling, I ordered them a la carte because I knew I couldn't eat three, but I found that even two were so heaped full of goodness I could get away with just one and walk away more than satisfied.  My husband is low carbing it so he ordered lettuce and meat and really enjoyed his meat choices.  We were really impressed with the freshness of our food and wanted to get the word out to support this local business, good tacos are very hard to find in this area of town, fantastic addition to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"A San Diego transplant, this is the only taco shop I didn't feel should be burned to the ground. I had the 5 small tacos and chose a variety. Tortilla s are awesome and beans are yummy. They ran out of guacamole which was very saddening."}
{"text":"Place is super legit kinda pricey but well worth it. I got a green chili beef burrito and I can barely finish this monster."}
{"text":"Its a nice taco place. some of the meat fillings stand out as excellent (barbacoa, tinga). most of the carne guisados (meat stews) are are tasty. but real tacos should not have lettuce and tomato on it. cheese, usually not also. real authentic tacos should not have any of that taco bell/chipotle crap on them. the tortillas are mediocre quality also. this place is OK overall, but in no way deserves a 5-star rating."}
{"text":"You know how sometimes you're searching for something and you see it on Yelp and it's got a million positive reviews and you wonder if it's really that good? That's the story of this place and believe the hype, friend... it's really that good.   I came here while visiting Phoenix with a friend of mine for the weekend. I'm not at all familiar with Phoenix, so I just searched for the taco place nearest me, and lo and behold, it was Santos Lucha Libre. How fortunate I was!  First of all, when you walk into this place, you realize it has a really cool vibe. The decorations are rather spartan compared to some other taco places, but they do a really good job of making the place look cool and modern. In any case, all the first impressions I was forming went by the wayside when one of the guys working there greeted us and asked if it was the first time there. Yes, indeed it was. He then said he would prepare a taste of each meat for us so we'd know what we liked. Each of the proteins (meat, chicken, pork) are prepared in about three ways, so there's a lot to taste. Though I later opted for something else, I can tell you everything was delicious. The carne al pastor was the best pastor I've ever had... it was truly awesome. My friend ordered one of each protein and said they were all perfect. I, however, ordered the fish tacos. Man, I love fish tacos -- except that most places give you like three milligrams of the fish and then a ton of veggies. Well, not at this place! They piled my tacos high with fish and then add the toppings as you like it (think Subway or Chipotle). My fish tacos were the best fish tacos I've ever had. That's how serious it is. It's so serious if someone were driving back to Phoenix for a weekend, I might be tempted to go just for those tacos. I'm not even joking.   All in all, this place wins all around. The decor was cool, the service was great, and the food was perfect. There's nothing to complain about here, except for they're like 300 miles from my house."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The two people working there were super helpful. They let us sample all the meat before we picked which kind of tacos we wanted. The salsa bar itself was worth going back for! Not to mention, the atmosphere is worth checking out too."}
{"text":"Excellent tacos. Our first time in so they told us to sample all the meats before making a decision.  I ended up getting 3 tacos of al pastor, green chile pork. And adobada beef. So good! Griddles tortillas were great, meats and toppings were tasty, and don't forget about the great ambiance of lucha!"}
{"text":"This little hole-in-the-wall taco place has fresh, authentic Mexican food at very reasonable prices. Yum!  This was so good!"}
{"text":"Delicious and authentic! If you've never been there they give you a little sample of everything and then you go from there! I always get three tacos with green chili beef and super nachos with green chili chicken. Always satisfies my taco cravings!"}
{"text":"Service excellent, food excellent. Get out there and support these guys!!  #nevergoingbacktochipotle"}
{"text":"Not to be confused with  Luncha Libre Food Truck - this place is located just south of North Mountain on 7th St. Great Tacos! and home of the 1lb burrito - this thing is massive!  If it's your 1st time be sure to ask to sample all of the meats; they offer a nice variety of Mexican-style meats, from barbacoa to carnitas, pastor and adobada.  The atmosphere is also entertaining with the bright colors and wrestling motif throughout; the staff is very nice and helpful- you'll be sure to enjoy dining in.  Welcome to the neighborhood, Santos!!"}
{"text":"A fun, yummy place to go occasionally if you don't live in the area, or frequent if you do, Santos Lucha Libre is an affordable, authentic experience.  From the moment you walk in and are greated by the dummy playing the piano (I'm not saying he's stupid, it's in fact a dummy) to the pictures adorning the walls of Spanish wrestlers, vinyl albums outside the walls of the bathrooms - it's really a unique athmosphere.  5 stars for being casual and fun.  When you walk in, you are greated to a counter where you order your food.  Basically, you want to pick your protiens (chicken done 2 ways, pork 4 ways, beef a couple ways  - ask for samples if you are new to the restaurant) and then they put together your tacos, enchiladas - pick your toppings (very fresh), a few sides to offer like chips and salsa or quac and away you go to your table.  Don't be intimiated by the choices - they are really nice behind the counter, and I can tell these folks are dedicated to their product and it's delivery.  Albeit, the guy that was serving me was very limited on his English.  5 stars for service and food.  Don't expect, because of the 5 star reviews (and if you saw this on yelps top 100) that this place is just going to be a Michelin five star restaurant experience.  The folks that were with me don't like spicey and they enjoyed themselves and loved the food and atmosphere (even two vegans in the group) - this is an all around affordable, authentic, yet amazing and fresh taste experience for just about anyone.  Kudos to the owners and staff for creating a top notch affordable experience!"}
{"text":"Nice and clean, huge portions, fresh ingredients. Diner casual. A great neighborhood destination!"}
{"text":"First time here and this places is a little different from your street taco vender/taco truck. Taco trucks typically only offer meats that cooked on a flat top. Santos does offer that and more. Santos offers the slow cooked meats that take time and special seasonings that you typically do not find at the taco truck at 3 am. The awesome staff offers a sample of the meat to try to help your selection.   I had traditional asada, babacoa, and green chile beef. All three were excellent. The babacoa was spicy."}
{"text":"Truly outstanding tacos and a ton of hot sauce options. They do also let you try as many of the types of meat as you want if you tell them it's your first time there (which it was for me).   For what it's worth, I think the walls were in transition between decor styles, so it was a little weird, but the food was amazing."}
{"text":"Excellent! It's the best Mexican food I've had in 25 years, since I lived in San Antonio. Very friendly , great service. Homemade tortillas, flavorful meats and many choices of heat and flavor. I loved it. I may fly back to Phoenix one day just for their tacos."}
{"text":"Oh man, this place is both of the bee's knees. I walked in as a naive gringo and the delightful woman working behind the counter saw my deer in headlights gaze and walked me down yum city. She gave me samples of all the meats, explaining the differences between them. Then once I had sufficiently stuffed myself on sample sized meats, i chose three meats for three tacos and sat underneath the watchful eye of captain luchadore as I had a foodgasm. Absolutely unmatched mexican food. The meat was seasoned perfect. Absolutely perfect. The staff was so friendly, the atmosphere so unique, the food so delicious. I will be taking all my friends here. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"I'd heard about this place for some time, but until recently, never had to chance to check it out since they're not on my side of town. Now that I've been, I realize what I've been missing all this time!   So I went here with a small group for lunch and, right when you walk in the door, this place's ambiance and decor jumps out at you. Very low key and no frills, but at the same time very nicely accented with lucha libre artwork, paintings, masks and even full costumes. Definitely not what you expect when you walk in off the street, but also really different and fun, so it works.   Because we were new to the place, we were treated with a small sampling of the different meats and levels of heat from mild to wild. There is definitely a full spectrum here and I appreciated the staff taking the time to properly introduce us to their fantastic variety. Talk about customer service!  We all settled on tacos, either the street size or the usual, and a couple different choices to fill them. I'm more the type that enjoys the flavor rather than the heat, so I played it safe with the mild chicken, pork and beef offerings, but others did try the spicier (and even the spiciest!) tacos, and none of us was disappointed by our meal. The meat was cooked perfectly on all our tacos and the fillings were clean and crisp. No wilted lettuce or mushy tomatoes, everything was very fresh. Another nice thing is that they have a freezer up front with authentic Mexican sodas, which go extremely well with the tacos, actually. On their own, they're not really my thing, but paired up with this type of food, it definitely works.   I'm looking for an opportunity to go back to that side of town and try some more of their offerings, and wish I had known about them earlier. A great place with great food very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Great place for a huge yummy meal! A/c could've been cooler. But the food was great. Nachos alone could feed at least 2!"}
{"text":"Great value & delicious food!  Been there quite a few times now.  I have only tried burritos and the wet burrito.  Setup is similar to Chipotle, but Santos Lucha Libre has more options and better food.  I love Chipotle, but to compare Santos to Chipotle is a slap in the face to Santos.  They have a sign out front that reads \"1 pound burrito\".  My burrito was massive, so out of curiosity I weighed it...1.5 pounds!  Cons: - Their restaurant is themed around professional wrestling, so they have masks all over the place, and it's creepy as hell!  Because of the decor, I could never eat there; I always get my food to go."}
{"text":"Delicious! Authentic! Generous! Cheap!  First mexican restaurant that exceeds expectations since moving to arizona. Thought I'd be drowning in delicious mexican food when I moved here but it's been like a needle in a haystack finding a good burrito! I mean the fact that chipotle was the tops said it all, smh.  Fun atmosphere although the mannequin playing the piano kept me looking back over my shoulder lol. Has a chipotle like assembly line but they offer tastings of every topping and meat like an ice cream shop. Very considerate. Few beers and Mexican sodas but most importantly there was a vegan option for me and plenty of meat options for my hubby. Generous portions and very friendly staff and you could tell all the ingredients were fresh.   Nothing says fresh and nothing to hide like an open kitchen and fresh avacados sliced in front of you to go on your burrito. Salsa bar topped if off though I wish they would label the salsa flavors, it was hard to guess what was hot or mild. We got drinks, salsa, 2 massive burritos and soft tacos and our bill was still under $30! Now if I only lived closer.."}
{"text":"So I thought this place was gonna be awesome, but sadly I agree with the \"average\" comments.  I didn't take interest in the food.  If you want great tacos and burritos, eat somewhere else.  Santos Lucha Libre is a cute spot.  Clean and decent.  The decor makes it obvious the appeal is for USA americanos and not necessarily Mexican americanos.    I got there before the crowd and took my time assessing the menu.  Typical dishes.  Meats and veggies were already prepared and sitting in the trays, the small salsa bar had some thin salsas sitting out.  El muchacho behind the counter was friendly and accommodating.  He invited me to taste the meats, but when I kindly let him know of my non-flesh desire he insured me that the rice and beans were 100% veggie.    Rice and beans?  Really?  That's all you got?   Just imagine my disappointment.   No spinach... No mushrooms...  No cactus... No jackfruit...   No bell peppers and onions...   Oh, but they also have breaded cod.  Would I like to eat a greasy deep fried fish taco?  Um, no thanks.  Not today.     But I didn't want to leave empty handed, so I opted for the chips and guacamole.  He added a spoonful of tomatoes to the guac tray before scooping a serving out for me.  Wish he hadn't done that.  Guacamole is one of my fave dips and he just made it taste mediocre.  Chips were mediocre too.  Sigh."}
{"text":"WOW! I just moved to Phoenix a few weeks ago and this place is near where I live. I decided to give it a try. You walk in and the staff is very friendly. They proceed to give you samples of all the meats they offer. You are almost full from all the samples! The food is great! I typically get the \"street\" tacos and all the ingredients are fresh. They are now expanding the restaurant and adding a bar. I know where I'll be hanging out..."}
{"text":"Nice find in the area. Taco Bar with so many options it made my head spin but the chicken hit the spot. 2 hot chicken and 1 mild. Perfect. Ordered the Nacho's  which was no more than chips with cold cheese, beans and a meat of my choice. very disappointing with the super tacos. I will be back and want to try the burritos but be assured the Nachos will not be on the menu."}
{"text":"A group of 3, we were asked if it was our first time there.  Since it was, they offered samples of all the beef, pork and chicken flavors.  We all got the 3 large tacos in the following flavors: barbacoa beef, the green chile chicken/beef and the tinga chicken.  YUM!!!!!!  They were incredibly delicious and we will be back- a lot!!  My personal fav was the green chile beef/chicken.  Had a kick to them, and oh-so-yummy!!  What a great find- thank you, Yelp!!"}
{"text":"I seriously can't stop eating here, it's so good!  If you like chicken, try the tinga.  I just got a container for take out to make tacos at home again and as always it's terrific.  The chicken is quite juicy so if you don't drain a bit off your tacos may be a little wet."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good and one of the best taco places ive been too. I decided to try them and see what all the hype was about.  I ordered 3 large tacos pastor, meat was juicy and i like how you can put what you want on it- 4/5  Asada burrito was pretty good and fullfilling - 4/5   I still love my taco truck better than these tacos but will forsure come here again when i dont want to make the drive to 16th street or when im just craving a quick taco.  Also i wish they would be open later than 7pm. I would def come here after night class but due to the time they close i wouldnt make it."}
{"text":"The food was decent. Not the best Mexican I've had. The decor is awesome!!! You have to see it to believe it. The service was excellent."}
{"text":"The most badas* restaurant in Arizona! Food is freash, flavorful and service is spectacular!  My family loves coming here as often as possible"}
{"text":"Read the reviews and went for lunch last Thursday , service was slow , tacos were hard to eat fell apart and not very tasty . 27$ for tacos and wife's taco salad seemed a little pricey , won't be back"}
{"text":"Best tacos in North Phoenix. The people who run it are great, and work really hard to produce quality food."}
{"text":"Everything is very fresh and they are absolutely telling the truth when they say \"spicy\". I'm coming back when I need a heat fix."}
{"text":"From Midwest on vacation and wanted some real tacos.  I like them super hot, wife and kids not so much.   Had plenty of choices to make us all happy.  Service was gread, food was outstanding and 15 bucks fed 4 (although we did eat a bit light).  I'm not a taco expert, but I absolutely loved it.   Green asada and hot sauce was hot but flavorful."}
{"text":"As newbies, we got to sample all the meats! Fantastic food, awesome decor! We loved the tortillas!"}
{"text":"I've been dying to try Most Wanted for awhile. Looking for some really good street tacos but have been unsuccessful until now. I was a little leery at first cause I wasn't sure about the area but once I got here it was rest assured. Nice area. Nice big strip mall.   Walking in I'm overwhelmed on what to order. Tacos, burritos or what. So what the heck. Just try it all. Only problem is I just went to the gym and this lunch just killed my workout.   I ordered three large tacos with carnitas, pastor, and asada. What they do is throw the tortillas on the grill to warm them up and throw your meat on the grill to warm it up too. Each taco comes with two tortillas and I added cabbage, tomatoes, cheese and guacamole (99 cents extra). Served it on a styrofoam tray.   Also ordered the fish burrito. When I ordered it and told her to eat here she gave me a funny look. Did I order too much. What the heck. Oh well. Anyways, they warm up the tortilla on the grill and deep fry the fish. Looked like tiny 1 inch pieces of fish. When they made it I asked for rice and black beans. They freaking gave me two big scoops of rice and two huge scoops of black beans with about ten pieces of fried fish and I had them put cabbage, tomatoes, and cheese. Now this is a freaking huge burrito. They could barely roll it up.   I loved the tacos. Started off with the pastor and it was so good. Juicy moist on a warm tortilla. Couldn't ask for anything more. The asada and the carnitas was just as good. Loved them all. I would have to say I liked the pastor the best. It almost seemed like a snack to me.   Then I had that freakin big fish taco. Oh my goodness. It was pretty good. They give you some chipotle fish sauce to put in it and it gives and nice kick to it. It was so big that it started to come apart. I would say it was good but really liked the tacos the best. It called Most Wanted Taco Shop so duh the tacos should be the star and they sure were. I'm proud to say I finished it all. No take home but I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. That is a lot of food.     Once you pay they have a pretty big dining area. Nice booths and high top tables. Very clean with Spanish music playing. Didn't get to try their salsa bar but it looked really good.   So I found my go to taco shop even though it's 20 minutes from home. Just remember to stick to the tacos. Great food. Reasonable prices. Friendly service. Will I be back? Of course I'll be back and I'll bring my family next time. Enjoy."}
{"text":"My second visit here to introduce my BFF and she loved it .  We both ordered the three-taco plate , no sides .  I chose the adobada, carne asada and a spicy beef, she chose three different mild options .   Their green salsa at the little salsa bar was hella spicy and I loved it.   Looking for more friends to bring over .  I'll be back :)"}
{"text":"I loved the green Chile chicken tacos. They were amazing. The red chile carne Asada tacos were super spicy, but delicious.  I would also like to thank the owner for letting us sample the meat before we ordered.  I well be back for more yummy tacos soon."}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!! I always get the Super Nachos and they never disappoint. Hands down THEE BEST taco shop in Phoenix!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place, tucked away, and I'm not sure how long it's been there. But the tacos are great and the service was fast and friendly. I highly recommend for anyone that wants great food at a reasonable price"}
{"text":"The lady who runs this place is fantastic. She had me try every flavor of meat before I ordered. The meats were all freshly made and taste amazing. Huge portions as well. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service, free samples of all the meats they offer and a fun and clean place to dine in at.  Santos Lucha Libre serves beef, pork and chicken which you can sample if you happen to be standing behind the glass with a blank look on your face (like I did). The lovely woman allowed me to sample each meats.   My favorites were the adobada and the pastor, the spicy ones were great and packed with heat. All were flavorful and I ended up settling for 5 street tacos so I could enjoy most of what they had to offer here. The toppings for the tacos were great and were more up to your preference. I also got a horchata to wash the tacos down.  The tacos are like street tacos, definitely more aesthetic looking, flavorful and the meats so juicy and tender. The meats here are definitely on the wet side as they are shredded and seem to be braised for awhile in their own juices. Good tacos! The horchata you can pass on.   The restaurant was so clean, lots of seating and was enjoyable to look around at the themed Lucha decor. The service was great and the people working here- feels like family owned, were so welcoming and kind.  I think the price is a bit steep for tacos/Mexican but the service, quality and cleanliness makes up for all the $ I don't really have- haha jk. Kind of."}
{"text":"Awesome, but be careful if you order something with \"medium\" spice level. I have a pretty high tolerance for spicy food, and it was quite spicy. Delicious, just very spicy :). Their tacos are awesome. Toppings are very fresh, and the staff is helpful and friendly! Love their salsa bar with the avocado/green salsa blend."}
{"text":"The Barbacoa Beef was so spicy and delicious!     But that's not the best part of this place!  First off, the staff is so nice!  If its your first time, they will give you a thorough run through of what they offer complete with a taste test and description of each meat offered.  Every sample we had was delicious, moist, and of varying levels of spiciness.   Want a burrito?  They have several different flavored tortillas to chose from: plain, wheat, spinach, tomato and chipotle!    Once you know how you want your food presented (taco salad, burrito, torta, etc.) you get to choose the fillings: rice, pinto beans, black beans, cabbage, lettuce, tomato, cheese, chopped onion, pickled onion, cilantro...the list goes on!!!  AND they have a salsa bar with so many choices to try, I'm surprised I was able to leave!!  Bottom line:  the food is amazing, the prices are completely reasonable, and the signs out front saying '1 lb Burrito' are a total lie!!!  Those things are EASILY 3 lbs when they hand them to you!!  My husband ate a bit more than half of his and the part we brought home weighed in at 1.4 lbs!  Yum!!!"}
{"text":"If I had the option I would probably give this 3 & 1/2 stars.  Admittedly my view may be a bit jaded, because there was so much hype I expected so much more. It's a glorified Chipotle."}
{"text":"What flavors!!  And the sweetest, most helpful staff ever.  You can taste pretty much everything prior to making your decisions... and you can tailor your dish exactly to your liking.  So grateful to have such a terrific place right in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Five star. 100%. My stomach is so happy. If any of you have been to Bodega Tacos in Miami Beach I would compare this to that (which is a rly rly rly good thing) They are very very authentic and have about 12 different meat options ranging from not spicy at all to very very spicy! I like it somewhere in the middle so got the Tinga, Asada, Pastor large tacos which perfectly filled my very hungry stomach! This place is pretty deep into North Phoenix, they have moved from the Central Phoenix location and look as if they are still building up the interior of the new spot! Highly recommend though! And this is from an AVID taco enthusiast!"}
{"text":"Seriously tasty made to order taco joint! Great vibe and decor. Tried the enchiladas this time....perfect! Beware of the SUPER hot green salsa....it's lethal but highly addictive! Awesome affordable place to get your mexi fix...LUCHA LIBRE!"}
{"text":"Okay....at the time I visited, I thought 486 reviews and 4.5 stars?  No way.  These guys must have a lot of friends and relatives.  I visited.  They gave sample of the various meats...pork, chicken and beef prepared with different spices.  I orders tacos with green chilie beef and a carne asada tostada.  Fantastic!  It's an earned rating and a must visit for mex lovers passing through Phoenix.  Thanks folks for a great meal.  Good luck in growing your business."}
{"text":"First off, the people here were SO friendly. I thought it was really cool that they let us sample all of their meats before we chose. I got a taco salad with Barbacoa and it was great, slightly spicy but nothing insane. Tried the fish tacos, fabulous. Chicken Tinga, delish. Everything was great. I can't wait until they a bar and start serving booze, that will complete the whole experience."}
{"text":"The picture says it all! Great flavors, fresh ingredients combined with fast and friendly service made this an easy stop. It was well worth the drive from Surprise during my Spring Training tour in March!"}
{"text":"We were visiting AZ for my son's tournament and found this gem.  Similar to Chipotle with protein choices on steroids! The cashier asked if we've ever been there before and when we said no, she let us sample their different meats, just like their website said they would. BThey were all delicious! We got a carne asada burrito and an a la vinegreta burrito - both with all the fixings!  My husband and I could have split one burrito, and he's a big eater! If we lived in AZ, this would definitely be a frequently visited spot!"}
{"text":"I guess you have to live in Phoenix in order to appreciate this place. My friend and I came in and had high high hopes for a restaurant that has 122 reviews and 5 stars on yelp. Let me preface by saying this: it does matter where you are from in the USA when it comes to the appreciation of the fine food arts.   The special sauce on the massive burrito smelled like booty. It was sad. The ingredients inside the burrito were relatively fresh to be honest but nonetheless the booty sauce killed it for me. Maybe I got the bad batch that fateful Friday afternoon.   There were two people working and it was busy. They have a salsa bar that was limited and not much to the imagination.   I am sorry Phoenix but you need to come to Chicago and try some Mexican food. I realize Phoenix is way way closer to Mexico than Chicago but good LoRD do they not know what good food is.   You guys got us beat when it comes to weather but that is it. Either that or the heat has killed their taste buds. This is not a five star restaurant."}
{"text":"Visited Santos Lucha Libre today for lunch and was floored by the flavor. They allowed us to try all of their meats and I decided that their Green Chili and Barbacoa are some of the best I've ever eaten. It's not just melt in your mouth deliciousness that gets me, it was the flavor that brought it home. Both were spicy but not hot for the sake of being hot. There was nuances of spices in each bite and it made the meat sing.  I went for the Barbacoa enchiladas. These are not your everyday enchiladas. They melt cotija cheese on the tortillas on the flat top behind the counter, and then place the meat on top of the opened tortillas. Once the cheese has melted they fold the tortillas over and place onto a plate and drizzle enchilada sauce on top from a squeeze bottle. Then they give you the option of topping it off with, lettuce, cilantro, tomatoes, onions, roasted corn, cheese, sour cream and guacamole (for an extra .99). The dish also came with your choice of rice and beans, I opted for the pinto beans and loved their flavor. Who ever came up with these recipes knows their spices!  I ordered a small horchata and then dug in. Only draw back is the cheap plastic wear. The knife barely cut through my cooked tortilla so it was a bit of a struggle, but every bite was worth the work.   Next visit definitely getting the green chili tacos."}
{"text":"Tacos weren't really that good. Their churros were pretty good though. One of the best I've ever had. I would go there again just to get it."}
{"text":"The food was solid and got the 3-stars, but the staff acted like they couldn't understand anything My girlfriend said. They acted like it was my fault and an inconvenience that I didn't tell them I had guacamole even though the food was sitting next to the cashier. Apparently the guacamole is extra although that was not stated on the menu."}
{"text":"I can't say anything the other reviewers haven't already said. Believe the hype."}
{"text":"Great authentic tacos here. This is my kind of place. The feeling and quality of a real home cooked meal. I'll be back for more."}
{"text":"Simply amazing. The Most Wanted Taco is THE place to go for some delicious tacos! There are several chicken, pork, and beef flavors to choose from. My favorite was the Tanga and the Asada. The best deal is definitely the 5 small tacos for $8. The service was quick, staff were friendly, the presentation was great, and the tacos were just worth the 20 minute drive from downtown Phoenix. I can't wait to visit this place again!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! We read the reviews and decided to try it. We tried the nachos and burrito and they were both amazing. Definitely recommend trying it :-)"}
{"text":"Of all of the mexican restaurants I have ever visited, Santos Lucha Libre is by far the best food I have ever experienced!  There are plenty of meats to sample before you get started on your main selection. I would highly recommend the 'street tacos'. Yes, street tacos are by far the best selection. In fact it was so good that I wanted to do it all over again. Sure, I have to buy new pants because I ate so much but trust me when I say it is excellent!  The staff is very friendly and the decor will make any person smile, if you like mexican wrestling. This food was prepared with love. Therefore you should give this place a try!"}
{"text":"I loved this place! I cane here with a friend and one of the employees greeted us and immediately insisted we sample all their meat selections. I did the green chile pork burrito which was fantastic. Might I even say better than Chipotle? Similar concept to Chipotle, but better all around. Great fun and funky decor. Music was interesting, it started out good then got weird. That's probably the only thing I would change... I marked this as good for kids, but be careful, many of the meats are spicy!!"}
{"text":"Wow, it doesn't get much better than this!!! First off, the Luche Libre paraphernalia is worth the trip alone. Love that shit!! Okay, those are just decorations and you don't go for that alone. We got there just before the dinner rush and as we checked out the menu the gal behind the counter offered us a sampling of all of their different marinated meats. Samples of the pork, beef and chicken?! Hell yeah they'll do that! You have any more kinds of marinated animal back there? Alright, got some street tacos go down the line and add some fresh garnish! Best street tacos in town!! This is how the match went down.  Chips and Salsa - Bam!!! Who doesn't like salsa bars?! Nice thin salted chips with many different salsas full of flavor and punch!!  3 Street Tacos (tried the carne asada, carnitas and pollo) - Kaboom!!! While your munching on those tacos you are getting whooped by flavor. Fresh corn tortillas, cilantro, onions, crema etc!!! Shit, my glittering spandex shorts feeling tighter! I'll just cover up my belly with my cape.  Hands down, get your ass to the corner of the ring, the match is over!! Love Lucha Libre and Love Santos Lucha Libre even more!!! Merodeador Irlandés - that's my Lucha Libre name. You'll find me wrestling Sunday's at various VFW's in the valley."}
{"text":"Update: I'm not sure if they are under new management but we were extremely underwhelmed. The food lacked flavoring and was just spicy for the sake of being hot. I've ordered the same things many times before with no issues.   After a wild night out, all I wanted was some amazing nachos. I stumbled upon this little joint on Yelp and thought why not give it a shot. Staff was very friendly and let my friend and I sample some options before we sealed our fate with some asada nachos. Food was delicious, everyone was courteous and 10/10 would come here again!"}
{"text":"Yelp reviews did not disappoint. It's a walk up order place, lots of selections the owner offered tastings of all the different meat selections from mild to spicy (it was like a beer or wine tasting!) My favs were pastor, spicy barbacoa and carme asada. The salsas were just as flavorful. The dining room was nice, more like a restaurant instead of a cafeteria. We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"These are truly the most wanted tacos around!  Location & Aesthetics - located in Phoenix just off N 7th Street, the business can be a little inconspicuous to notice at first, but once you enter the little strip mall where it's located, you won't have any trouble finding it. Lots of available parking in a large parking lot. Interior decor is interesting as they have paintings of Spanish dressed wrestlers.  The dining room with its comfortable seating, adequate lighting, and clean, l  Menus - clearly posted above the food preparation area however I would warn that you take some time to process it as it can be a little confusing what to choose from as a first timer like myself.  Service - Staff was very warm and welcoming, and answered the many questions we had about the menu items.  They even were accommodating enough to suggest and create a menu for us based on what was most popular which I found to be absolutely fantastic!  Food - I had three large tacos with everything on it, and though I can't exactly say what I had as I gave the food preparers the option to create it based on what's popular, I have to say the food was outstanding.  I do know that one taco had chicken, one had beef, and another had pork and they all tasted great - hot, tasty, and very well seasoned with all the toppings fresh.  Remember, each category of chicken and pork has 5 types of levels of spiciness or meats (not sure if the latter is correct as I am no connoisseur of tacos so forgive the misinformation); the beef only has 4 levels.  I do know that the preparer made one with some spiciness, and I have to say, it did have some kick to it so for those with sensitive palettes, watch out.  Overall, really great food, atmosphere, lots of menu items to choose from, and great staff! Will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We would highly recommend Santos Lucha Libre Taco. I had the 5 taco special where you get the best of 5 of their meats... to die for full of flavor and spice... she had the burrito and tacos... highly recommended as well... well worth the enntire experience.... you would be loco to give this place less then 5 stars... we will be back soon..."}
{"text":"My boyfriend works near this shop and keeps coming home talking about it. So today we met for lunch.  I dont care what anyone says... This place is amazing!!! I have been looking for a good place to go for street tacos on the west side or central area (pretty crazy being in phx and I have only found one other place that even know what street tacos are -Speedys on 40th St and Washington) but most wanted taco shop is amazing!!!! Fresh is an understatement!!! I had the carne small tacos with everything on it and it was amazing!!! Service was polite and very fast!!! You gotta go! Ignore and negative reviews because they obviously dont know what good street tacos should taste like! AMAZING"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The selection of authentic meats, toppings, served in tacos, burritos and quesadillas were excellent. If the line is not long let the people there let you know that you are a first time visitor and they immediately thank you for coming to the restaurant and start handing you samples of the spicy meats to see which you like the best. Also, the salsa bar has authentic salsas from mild to extremely hot. Clean and fun dining environment. I will be back and bring my friends!"}
{"text":"Excellent Tacos!  I didn't know where to eat...so I \"yelped it!\" This place came up as #1, so I drove over!  Very friendly staff!  I'm definitely gonna come here again!"}
{"text":"Went in for lunch today and the young lady behind the counter set up a bunch of samples for us of the various meats. All of them were really good and I settled on a couple of large chicken tacos. Absolutely amazing and I wish I had gotten a couple more. I definitely will be back to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"It's rare to find a restaurant that meets and exceeds our \"foodie\" expectations!  The workers were so appreciative of us coming in on Father's Day!  They ran out of chicken (because we are a family of 8) and they were so apologetic and accommodating with samples of all their meats and even gave us free churros for our boys because of it. And I actually think the pastor flavored meat was tastier than the chicken.  So, I only give 5 stars to a place that has great good and great service!  We will be back every time we come to Phoenix!  A special thanks to Erik for his excellent people skills!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and awesome owner. They let you sample the meat. The decor is awesome.    Kinda bugged me their yelp coupon is still up and not honored.  I went with the tacos, I probably should have gone with the burrito. Chips and salsa are pretty terrible.   I'll be back if I'm in town."}
{"text":"I went in for a quick fix not knowing what to expect beyond a fast casual taco shop. The reviews seemed good and my husband was hungry. I ordered him a carne azada burrito and three enchiladas for myself. The add the fixings to your liking so that was good. My order was made into tacos not enchiladas but rather than waste food, I took them anyway. I tried the chicken and chile verde. I loved them. Very spicy to my liking. Just loved them. My hubby was so impressed with his massive burrito. He loved it and his employees were impressed. He works at a retail store near by. I'll be visiting most wanted again.  I would give 4 stars but my order was wrong. I really wanted enchiladas:-)"}
{"text":"They recently changed their name back to the original \"Most Wanted Taco Shop\", but they've been around for a little while. Simply put, this is what you expect when you picture tacos in Arizona. They are AMAZING, and the wide variety of meat choices is part of the fun. They'll let you sample as many as you like, so definitely come hungry. They've got a few choices for your tortilla, and they do massive burritos and quesadillas, as well. Top it off with fresh, homemade guacamole and you've got all of the bases covered!  As the other review states, the space is still a bit unfinished, as I believe they are currently waiting to expand into the sports bar that closed down next door. They didn't have a liquor license when I went last time, but a few cervezas will be a nice touch in the near future!"}
{"text":"The tacos here are fresh and excellent. Definitely generous in portion size, too. The cochinita pivil and barbacoa were my favorites, but also loved the pastor and carne adovada. The horchata was also super yummy. The lady was so nice, she even let us sample all the meats. I prefer these tacos to Joyride. Definitely don't pass this place up. Great local gem."}
{"text":"This place is good, really good. They have 5 different meats ranging in spice warmth - each with their own distinctive flavor. I enjoyed all five. I chose the three taco plate with pastor, green chili and one other beef. Incredible flavors on all of the meat. Then you have the opportunity to select various toppings, cilantro, lettuce, red onions, white onions, hominy, sour cream, cheese, cabbage (a few more I do not recall). A few salsa options are available also. Note: these are not street taco size they are full size soft shell tacos. I will be back to support this awesome restaurant"}
{"text":"Good food. Nice small place. Only downfall was a big group came in and the workers got flustered. Ordering/paying was a bit chaotic"}
{"text":"I thought 5 stars on yelp for that many reviews?  Well it is true. It is a 5 hands down!  If this place had beer and good margaritas it would be the very best.   First of all- not that who is running the place matters on the taste of the food- but the people running the place are great. We had never been here and they jumped right in to have is try all the different meats for our meal. I ordered things i never would have because I tried it first.   The atmosphere is all about Mexican wrestlers and the decor is fun and eclectic.  At first you wonder what the place is all about- Especially is in strip mall.   The food is delicious and spectacular. I wish we lived here so we could come all the time. The prices are very good.  The meat is shredded which is easier to eat and is braised  in the most delicious juices.  Everything is incredibly fresh.   Excellent experience."}
{"text":"Tacos are simply phenomenal! fresh and good tasting! Words cannot describe how amazing these tacos are :)"}
{"text":"I have eaten at this restaurant five times, and the tacos are quite good.  Fresh tortillas, grilled at the time you order.  Delicious meats to choose from.  My friends enjoy the burritos and the beans.  The decor is a lot of fun.  The people behind the counter are friendly.  On the downside, it is a self serve kind of place where you have to get your own soda and salsas.  Usually the music is too loud, so it is somewhat difficult to carry on a conversation with your friends.  And the wait in line to get your food is a bit excessive, primarily due to the odd way the staff has of offering you every item, one at a time:  \"would you like cheese?  What about onion?  What about....\"  It is just inefficient.  If you are all about the food and like kitschy decor you will love this place."}
{"text":"Goofy, fun decor.  Getting to sample all of the meats was very helpful in finding the one.  Guac is yummy, was heartbroken when they ran out before we got there.  Recommend to anyone who sits still long enough to hear about it!"}
{"text":"This is a small place that I am surprised was not packed.  The servers were very friendly and offered samples of all of the different types of meat in little serving cups to help me decide. The green chile beef was my favorite!  I got the taco salad with green chile beef but it is really closer to a \"burrito bowl\" like you would get a Chipotle but served in a fried flour tortilla.  Toppings were good and fresh and the decor is hilarious.  Very reasonable prices for the massive serving size!"}
{"text":"Best burrito in sunnyslope, awsome service and close to my house.always a treat coming here"}
{"text":"Awesome place! Great food! All of the meats are cooked to perfection and will not disappoint. If you are in the Phoenix area check out this gem. This place stands out from other Mexican restaurants and the Luchador decor is priceless."}
{"text":"The lady was nice enough to let us sample the meats. My wife had the 3 large tacos and i had the meat burrito. They operate like subway where you pick out what gets put on your tacos or burritos. We got it to go and it was so good! This place is going to be part of our shortlist of places to eat! Thanks"}
{"text":"Serving only tacos and tortilla chips, the best way I can think to describe this place is that it's sort of an uber-clean Mexican Subway sandwich shop with an interesting Nacho Libre atmosphere - there's even a life-like hooded wrestler mannequin positioned to greet you as soon as you walk in the door.  The tacos here are different than what I'm used to; different, but good.  Instead of strips of fajita meat, these tacos come with a finely shredded beef or chicken, which are marinated and served in a variety of seasoned broths, from mild to smoking hot.  The toppings, like cheese, lettuce, cilantro, and onions, are offered up Subway style, so you get just what you want in the exact amounts you want.  These are exceptionally tasty tacos, but they do need to be eaten fast, before the tortilla gets soggy from the broth."}
{"text":"Amazing food! My wife loves the tacos and burritos I enjoy the super nachos. Plus being a wrestling fan I really enjoyed the photos and stuff on the walls."}
{"text":"Biggest burrito ever! It's a two-hander and once you start you cannot stop, if you put it down you will lose it. They have a bunch of different meats to choose from; chicken, cow, and pig and then of course you can do a vegetarian option as well.  I get a vegetarian burrito, and it is seriously felt like it weighed at least 2lbs. Be sure to add the picked red onion because it makes anything you eat pop. This place is that assembly line style where you tell them what you want to add as you move along (ex: Subway, Chipotle, Quiznos) but it is not crappy and  commercialized like the chain store examples are. Last but not least, the theme is amazing, its obviously Lucha Libre which if you are not familiar with it specifically it's the Mexican wrestling with the colorful masks. Anyways, the whole place is decorated with masks and neon glitter, it's fantastic.  Casual, huge portions, fun decor, non-commercialized, yummy food."}
{"text":"Decided to make the drive from Tempe to North Phoenix today to try out the Most Wanted Taco Shop due to the amazing reviews on Google and Yelp. It is a Chipotle style way of ordering your tacos or burrito. I particularly enjoyed how they had marinated onions and fresh cilantro to add to your order. The guac looked spot on though I did not try any. I ordered the 5 small tacos so I could try a few of the meats. The beef barbacoa was very good, the green chili pork was good and the chicken was \"eh.\" The rice was unimpressive, but I am biased towards cilantro lime rice from Chipotle which I know is not authentic Mexican.   I didn't realize that you could not order the fish when you get the small tacos, and mentioned something about it at check out. The person ringing us up heard me and said he'd bring me out one. Super nice guy. As I was eating my other tacos he brought out two regular sized fish tacos with all the fixings. They were amazing. Definitely recommend the fish for something special. Also, if you prefer flour tortillas to corn tortillas, get the burrito, as they only have corn tortillas for tacos. They also have a little salsa bar with sliced limes for you to add to your meal yourself.   Overall, amazing customer service and well worth it once you know what your ideal order is."}
{"text":"Welp, I've found my favorite local place.  From the decor to the food, everything about Most Wanted is top-notch. I met a friend here for lunch on a Sunday. There was a steady amount of people coming in and out, but the service certainly didn't suffer. Since it was our first time in, we were offered samples of all of the different meats...which made it incredibly hard to choose, as there wasn't a bad one in the bunch. But there's no guessing as to which you will like...you'll know! The people who came in after us had been in before, but asked to sample a few anyhow, and they seemed happy to oblige. I ended up getting 3 large tacos: Creamed (chicken), Cochinita Pibil (pork), and Barbacoa (beef). All of the meats were incredibly flavorful. We shared a basket of chips and guac which was tasty too. There's also a salsa bar with 3 different heat levels available, plus all the limes and jalapenos you could want. My advice? Skip the fountain drinks and peruse the cooler of bottled varieties by the door...you can't go wrong with the legendary Mexican Coke.  Finally: the decor. I was in love from the moment I walked in. I love bright (some would say tacky, but whatever) walls and glitter. Add in some badass Lucha Libre portraits and masked heroes flying from the walls and you have Most Wanted's vibe. Basically, it's a delicious heaven for me."}
{"text":"Had a burrito from here after coworkers recommended it. The owner let me try everything since he knew it was my first time there. I'm definitely now a customer. The green chile pork was good! Great customer service and great food. What more can you ask for."}
{"text":"This place was OUTSTANDING!!! We had carne Asada fries, burritos & tacos !!! Super friendly family owned & they let us sample all the meats .. DELISH!! You will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"Really great tacos! I had the fish tacos and my husband tried a variety. He like the spicy barbacoa the best. We live nearby and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Tacos were a hit at most wanted taco shop. Fresh tortillas, clean preparation counter. The staff offered many samples to see which of the flavours were are favourite.  Would come again for sure.  I do like a grilled dry meat also which was not available."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the pork street tacos.  They have many meats to choose from, all I have tried are delicious!  Burritos, tacos, bowls all delish! Fun inviting atmosphere, friendly staff!  I highly recommend giving it a try.  Im going back for seconds right now!"}
{"text":"Great little place with amazingly delicious food. Love the atmosphere and fun decor. My burrito was made to order and it was HUGE!, My girlfriends 3 taco plate was three actual tacos, not street tacos. The meat (we tried beef and pork) was outstanding, we could've just ordered a plate of meat and been satisfied. (They have great options if you're not into meat) We will recommend to friends and invite them to join us. Very casual, and the staff is very helpful and accommodating."}
{"text":"Street Taco HEAVEN!  The pork, and the beef.  ASADA ME.  Grilled Cactus and Homemade salsa.  AND CHEAP!   I am wasting your precious time.  Just trust.    However parking is minimal.  4 spots in the front.  Building is up on a hill next to the mechanic shop."}
{"text":"Very welcoming, friendly staff, awesome selection, good prices, best in Phoenix so far. This is definitely one of my go-to restaurants in general in all of Phoenix. Delicious!"}
{"text":"I love the Luchas Libre Decor!  Fun!  There are so many different heat levels and delicious simmered meat choices.  I ended up with an El Pastor, Cochinita Pibil, and a Green Chile beef taco with just the right stuff in the fresh warmed tortilla.  Great choices of Pop and fountain sodas.    Everything was delicious, fresh, and made to order.  We will definitely come back!  My husband, who is very heat sensitive, made me laugh!  He said the Barbacoa was delicious \"grab you by the ears and kick you in the balls - hot!\"  LoL that means he thought it was spicy!  I, on the other hand, am more accustomed to spicy and I thought it was really good!  If you are a first timer you can taste all their meat options before you decide.  Nice!   5 Stars for sure!"}
{"text":"This was the first taco stop on last night's taco tour with Jon and Amy H. I must say, the tacos here were fairly legit. They allow you to taste all of the meats before ordering, which was a nice touch. Several of the meats were very spicy, and I appreciate that very much. I liked the cochinita pibil, the tinga chicken (surprisingly the spiciest, which is awesome cuz tinga can tend to be bland), and the green chili beef. The adobado was good too. The husband and I split the 5 street tacos (for 7$...Holy Deal!!) and got all the toppings on them. The salsas from the salsa bar added just the right amount of heat and flavor to make for some yummy tacos. I especially liked the light green salsa. The tacos were decently large and they were not stingy with any of the ingredients. Now, these aren't my favorite tacos ever, but they were the best of the night. Will be back!"}
{"text":"We drove all the way from Queen creek to have a taco. This place is spot on, and the Ingredients are fresh. We had to wait on beans but that's okay; they gave us a flan for the wait. Thank goodness they did, I would have missed out on yumminess. The flan made in house and is the best I've had.   The staff is very friendly and super nice.  The place is clean!  We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Best tacos in Phoenix! I am a bit of a street taco snob and this place exceeds expectation. I love all their meats- especially the chicken vinaigreta. The salsa bar is bomb too. They are only getting better now that they will serving alcohol so you can have a beer with your tacos!"}
{"text":"After reading Yelp's list of top 100 places to eat I saw this was one of them and decided to give this place a try. I read some of the reviews so I had a good idea of what to expect. The staff was very friendly and one of them offered us a sample of all the different meats which was awesome.   The meat is really good. There really wasn't one that I didn't like. I especially liked the Adobada (spiiiicy!). Me and my son each order the 3 tacos each with different meats. We also ordered some chips with jalapeño cream cheese. I loaded up my tacos with almost every topping, I mean I get a choice so why not! The chips were super crispy and good and the jalapeño cream cheese was pretty good. They also have a salsa bar which had some really great salsa.   Over all it was pretty good with fairly reasonable prices and I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place is killer!! One of the best taco shops in town. Everything is super fresh and very tasty. The staff is very pleasant and friendly. Can't beat 99 cent guacamole, fresh salsa bar and the great selection of tacos/burritos. Highly recommend this spot."}
{"text":"Had this place bookmarked for months and finally made the trip out.  Nom nom nom, wow these tacos are great.  We got two of everything and all of them are outstanding.  Funny as I typically go for carne Assad and that was the only meat I didn't order.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came here the other weekend to grab some of these highly rated tacos after friends wouldn't stop raving about them. As someone used to side of the road,  cooked on a hot piece of foil, tacos, these were a pretty big departure from the norm for me, and although different I thought they were just as good.   To be honest, I'd probably prefer my street tacos to these tacos at Most Wanted, but they definitely are different than what most other taco places offer, and I think everyone should make an effort to come by and try it out at least once, they're definitely not bad for the price and taste like nothing else I've ever tried. They hae a huge selection of meats both spicy and non-spicy, from pork to beef to chicken, and they are more than wiling to let you sample all the meats, so don't be shy. Come through and give this place a shot, try all the different meats, pick your favorite few and chow down!"}
{"text":"Drove out from Mesa to try this place given its excellent Yelp reviews.  The service was helpful and friendly.  I got the super nachos with asada beef, 5 small tacos (barbacoa, pastor, green chile chicken, red chili).  Liked the food, nachos would have been good if there was some fresh guacamole though.  The ambient temperature in the restaurant was uncomfortably warm, probably over 80 degrees.  Not sure if this was from the fact that it looks like they are expanding the indoor seating, or they just didn't turn the AC up, but it was uncomfortable.  The decor was cool though.    Overall the food was pretty good but probably not enough to get me to drive 30 min for, too much good Mexican food in the Valley."}
{"text":"Way overrated. We always trust the Yelp community. If something is 3 1/2 or more stars we have no hesitation to try it. The Yelpers let us down on this place. We paid $21 for small carnitas, pastor, barbacoa, carne asada, Cochinita Pibil tacos and a bean & cheese burrito w/ 2 drinks.   The beans were whole pinto beans. The cheese is shredded Oaxaca or cotija. Could not tell which tacos were which. They were all just shades of grey meat with NO flavor.   Very disappointed on the decor. the pics show a lucha motif but none of that was on the walls on 4/30/16.   Cannot give one reason to go to MWT. The best thing I can say is it wasn't awful (which is not the same as being good).   Will still try places based on Yelp ratings in the future."}
{"text":"Great place!!! Kinda like chipotle in that you order by item. We got the 5 small tacos, 1 large taco, a burrito, and enchiladas.   Enchiladas were not amazing, but everything else was amazing!!!! Loved this place.... We will be making it a regular."}
{"text":"What a fun little place with phenomenal food!  I let them know it was my first time and they offered me a taste of each of their meats, all of which were delicious.  The set up is kind of like a Chipotle, where you select your meat and then go down the line of toppings telling them what you would like to add to your taco or burrito.  But the quality of ingredients is FAR superior.  Be sure and pay for a side of chips because you will want to try each of the salsas.  Super yum to everything.  If this place had alcohol I would become a regular."}
{"text":"Like Chipotle with better selection of meats.  Fresh add-ons.  Definitely a new frequent hangout."}
{"text":"Fresh quality, ingredients. Friendly staff. I've come twice and haven't been disappointed. Came as a family both times, brought a friend the second time. Dinner time wasn't too busy, but still lively. Lunch is great. I am a fan of an open burrito. My husband does a wet burrito. Kids do quesadillas. Fresh guacamole and chips made in house."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to this place mainly because I love tacos and I'd never tried it before. To be honest I was a little disappointed. The food wasn't bad but it wasn't as good as I hoped. This place isn't bad and I would consider eating there again but there are plenty of other taco shops in town that offer a better value and better taste."}
{"text":"If you're looking for some amazing tacos in a no-fuss (but incredibly clean) environment, look no farther. They make all their own meats (with an overwhelming amount of choices) and every one of them is delicious. Their burritos and taco salads are HUGE too."}
{"text":"The tacos here are awesome. Since it was our first time they let us taste all the meat first. They all were really good. Highly recommend this place. Great prices and great food."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town and checked for a taco place close by, the food lived up to the reviews! Lots of seating. Fresh, authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"A great addition to the neighborhood!! It must be tough selling Mexican food in this area- lots of good places to go. But, Lucha is one of the best. The recipes are the families originals. The food is very authentic and plentiful. Flavors are amazing!! Previous reviews have touched on the meats, variety and options available, so I will save you the reading. All the quicker to get over there!!!  Go!! Runnn!"}
{"text":"First off, let me say this place has potential up-the-wazoo! The only reason I give this place 4 stars is because I know they can and probably will improve their systems slightly. But hey, first time visit and I'm fu#&in impressed.   Right when I walked in the line attendant asked me if this was my first time visiting, and started giving me samples of the meat. Whatt?? Even Chipotle doesn't do that. The different meats here are delicious ranging from mild, and increasing the heat to spicy. I think for the most part they shred the chicken, pork and steak, and keep it in their marinades, so beware, at least what I tried, the meat was wet, which was totally fine.   They then ask you what you want. In terms of tacos, you get two sizes, small(street taco) and large, and from looking outward both appear small. Don't let this worry you. I got 3 tacos and they load it up Chipotle style with whatever condiments you want. Both options are corn tortillas which they double up and heat on the grill.   Like I said earlier, the meat is wet so once they make the taco, the disintegration factor starts taking effect. They then push down the line and you get about 6 or 8 additional topping options all no extra charge, except for guac (like always :( ).   Then that's it, you pay and you go to the next room where you have the soda fountain, salsa bar, and surprisingly comfortable booths, with music and tvs playing, very spacious.   The salsa bar is great, however I've had better salsa. The hottest one has that slightly bland Chipotle flavor, but the green sauce is extraordinary.   Once you sit down make sure to attack those tacos as quickly as possible, because no one likes it when all the insides fall out.   Oh and by the way, when they say spicy, they really mean it. My nose was running, cheeks were red, and my mouth on fire, but totally worth it.   The only thing I can think to improve this place is how to more quickly get the samples out, and to speed up the line. While I was waiting I was actually wondering what this place is like during lunch. There was only one couple on front of me, yet it took five minutes to get through the samples, then another 5 to get to the end to pay.   If they can fix that, this place can go from being like \"GRAVITY\" to being like \"INTERSTELLAR\"; and a 5 star in my book."}
{"text":"Great place. This (almost literal) hole in the wall stylishly serves up some great tacos. I ordered 2 red chile tacos with guacamole and the flavorful meat was punctuated by the fiery hot sauce. No beer yet, but this will be a \"go to\" place for me once they get a liquor license. Recommended."}
{"text":"Lucha Libre is off the top rope! Best taco meat options I've ever experienced. Friendly staff and fun decor. If it was closer to my house they'd have to give me a key to the place. Can't wait till my next visit."}
{"text":"All the meats are so delicious, so getting small tacos was great to avoid committing to just one. Amazing guac and salsa verde. Best corn tortillas I've ever had."}
{"text":"I LOVE their tacos. The chicken tinga is my favorite and if you really like spicy their green chili chicken is pretty hot!   Their flan is really good too! Can't beat authentic flan.  If you ever have a question they will let you sample the various meats before making up your mind."}
{"text":"Finally decided to try this place and I was definitely impressed!    Warm welcome and when the clerk noticed I might be new she offered samples of everything. I was surprised and grateful. Establishment was clean, food looked fresh and was full of flavor.   I have been back twice this week!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Newbies are offered a \"taste test\" of the various kinds of meat ( employees gladly do this; no attitude present). Food is made assembly line style (ala Chipotle ) but in a smaller, family-business setting. They put their resources into a great product so the space is simple, clean and comfortable ( quirky decor actually..I quite like it!). Load up on napkins, as the meats are juicy and messy, but I mean that in the best way possible!  If you're not in this area and you find yourself anywhere nearby, this definitely should make you list of places to try!"}
{"text":"Yum Yum Yum Yum Yummmmm.......  Just ate here and had to get this out. The ladies behind the counter are very welcoming. We were offered a full sampling of ALL the meats (there are about 7 of them). We tried everything.  We ended up with street tacos and regular tacos filled with all the spicy meats and spicy chicken. Very flavorful. The place is set up like Chipotle ....but here's thing, it's way better! It's authentic Mexican food, and there are many combinations of food options. They also have cool wrestling posters and masks that decorate the walls.  There are a few flat screen TV's as well. Cute place, but the food is even more amazing.  What a pleasant surprise. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Lots of flavors, very nice staff, I give it a 3.5. The tacos were good but not as authentic as I've had, or as good as joyride or some other taco places."}
{"text":"I love the decor. I felt like I was in the Nacho Libre movie in real life. The staff was nice and friendly and gave samples so you could truly figure out what you were in the mood for. All of the meat was amazing. It tasted like it had been slow cooking all day. I got the 5 street tacos ----it was awesome. The churro was also yummy. I will be back. If you are looking for authentic and fun---this is definitely a great choice!!!!"}
{"text":"It was good.  Too far of a drive for me to really be worth it, but on my quest for best tacos in az, I'm glad I made the trip at least once.  Lots of variety on meats.  Wish they had better salsa selection, but could have just been my visit.  If they have a better salsa bar next time, I'd consider 5 stars."}
{"text":"The luchador theme is awesome. Amongst other things, reminds me of Nacho Libre! The burritos are humongous. I'd compare to a fresher, more homemade Chipotle, which I think is great. A few of the meats are on the saltier side but it isn't too bad. Service is also great, they are extremely friendly and helpful. Will definitely go back to try some other things."}
{"text":"This place is insane. Modest though it appears from the outside and even when you walk in, the food is perfect.  Super nice servers let you design your own and the quality of the ingredients is excellent. What is shocking is how much food you get for such a low price. $5 for my daughter's burrito that was the size of a linebacker's upper arm!  My tostadas were unbelievable, even better than the taco (which was also great.)"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Mexico style taco shop in america...  With great service and great food."}
{"text":"The food is awesome. I got the wet burrito and my hubby the tacos. This place is amazing and they let you try the different meats before you buy it. Staff was friendly. We did pass it up though because it sits in a shopping center."}
{"text":"This place is super trendy. The food selection was so fresh and flavorful. They have a wide variety of marinated meats. It's set up similar to Chipotle, but this place is way better!"}
