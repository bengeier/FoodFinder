{"text":"Typical Chinese restaurant, food is good, dish size and price are reasonable because they are on promotion, $1 half chicken when order more than $30.  Restaurant is renovated in an old building so the washroom is the reason to loss a star."}
{"text":"This place was really bad. We ordered around 15 dimsum dishes on a Saturday afternoon and all but one were terrible: bland or just plain bad, like \"I can't believe you served this to someone, have you no shame\" bad. 

Definitely won't be back, even if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Great place for traditional chinese food!

Came here for my birthday. Had the King crab dinner combo. Got a ~9lb king crab, steamed crab legs with glass noodles. Fried crab body, crab shell soup and crab fried rice. The meal also comes with steamed fish, stir fry pepper pork and another veggie dish. Can definitely feed 8 people! And a good value too for 388!

The service was great I also got a special dessert for my birthday. The place needs a bit of updating, I think they just kept the previous decor from the restaurant here before. But it's now under new management and I am quite impressed with the service and the food quality here. It hard to see the resturant from the street, so keep an eye out for it, its under a bowling place."}
{"text":"I would give it a well deserved 3.5 but there's no such a thing since you either go for a 3 or straight to a 4 because the bill came up better than expected (not even $40 for the 4 of us) considering what we ordered, and because in my experience today I've been served with good food. I was brought here by three of my HK born'n'raised friends to celebrate CNY. 
And since this is a place not so common to the young crowd, I'd like to assume that this is what the old generation either from mainland China or HK usually go to have a very affordable food close enough the the flavours from back home.
So, I want to be generous and I'll give it a 4. 

Food here is served fast and with generous size for each portion you order. The taste In my opinion is better than many other Chinese restaurants where at times, I find to lack a bit in flavour. 
Definitely, best I had today were the chicken feet and the braised pineapple steamed pork bun.
The first item I mentioned came with a generous amount of sauce and the serving came hot and not slightly cold like I often get in other places. 
While the char siu bao (or keke pua'a) with pineapple came, for the first time in my life, with real pieces of pineapple inside. 

Looking around and seeing that I was the only gweilo, it reassured me about the authenticity of the place and its food. 

Give it a try and don't let the condition of the building fool you because if you do, you are the one who has something to lose/miss here. 

Like Arnold Schwarzenegger once said ...\"I'll be back\"!"}
{"text":"Located below Club 300 Bowl, it's easy to miss. I'm a sucker for Green Onion & Ginger Lobster and they have a $9.99/lb special right now when $30 worth of other dishes are ordered.

However they will try and trick you into up-sizing. Ask for 3 pound lobster, they'll tell you only 5lb left. Ask for 2lb and they'll offer you 4lb. Say NO and they'll mysteriously find a lobster closer to what you want! Dirty tactic.

3 stars for the food, but took off one because they use a sleazy move to up-size my lobster."}
{"text":"My family is a huge fan of their dim sum! 
It's cheap but the quality of food are always fresh and delicious. 

Unfortunately, they have recently closed due to the land being sold. Hopefully they will reopen soon in the nearby neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Very poor quality food, small portions, dirty plates and bowls. This is considered bad Chinese restaurant in the neighborhood. Would I recommend this place ? no because the portions are extremely small. food is not fresh basic sweet-and-sour pork dish is not even ok.   spinning table was dirty....
Honestly there is nothing really much to say about this place but there's a lot of areas to improve"}
{"text":"Food alone 3 star.  Overall value 4 stars.

Happy Time is one of those neighbourhood restaurants that depends on returning customers from the nearby neighbourhood.  And words of mouth.

We visited based on recommendations from friends.  The restaurant offered many dinner combos that were suitable for groups.  Many combos featured lobsters, king crabs, skinned ducks and free range chicken.  Too bad that we had a small group, so we ordered a small combo ($50) that featured half a free range chicken, and 3 entrees of your choice from a predefined list of entrees.  The combo came with free starter soup and free dessert.  The 4 entrees tasted average and slightly oily.  The chefs did not cheap out on good ingredients since the dishes were loaded with fish fillets, beef, oysters, etc.  The freshness of the ingredients were average.  The portion was good.  For $50, this was a steal.

In terms of services, we were seated promptly.  We got the starter soup shortly after placing the order.  Then we waited, and waited, and waited.  I complained to a manager.  The chicken (pre-made) arrived momentarily.  The rest of the entrees arrived shortly after, and the manager took special care to bus our table and give us dessert himself.  I guessed someone misplaced our order, and the manager tried to make up for the services lag.  

Happy Time Seafood offered good value for big groups.  The food tasted decent and traditionally prepared.  Despite the service issues, the manager tried his best to make it up, so I am not deducting the stars.  I am looking forward to revisiting with more people to take advantage of the bigger dinner combos."}
{"text":"I came here for dim sum with my parents on an early weekday morning to catch the early bird special (no tea charge and only a $1 charge for the tablecloth). It wasn't too busy so we were promptly seated. I was surprised when they handed us a complimentary Ming Pao to enjoy.

As for the food, nothing really stood out to me. They did have two dishes that I don't see often - fried custard buns with condensed milk and a coffee flavoured \"Jell-O.\"

As for the service....well, don't come here for awesome service because you're not going to get it! It wasn't horrible service, it was just any typical service you'll get a cheaper dim sum Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"hmmm. not much to say about this place. i hate reviewing chinese restaurants, they are more or less always the same kind of thing. service was pretty good?"}
{"text":"3 star for food and +1 star for value.

$1.98 All dim sum aside from special priced items at Early Bird and Afternoon Tea Special and no charge for tea ($1 for table cloth)

I did not have a high expectation. As seriously, this maybe the CHEAPEST dim sum restaurant in Toronto and Beyond. At this price, I am lucky if the food is served at proper temperature and half decent...

First thing that impressed me is the huge menu! There is the normal traditional item plus some interesting one that not offered in other even higher end restaurants. BTW, yes they have durian pastry at $1.98 too! 

There are almost 60 items on the menu to choose from at $1.98. Picking items can be difficult as there are so many items I want to eat!

We shared:

- Beef Rice Roll
- Har Gow
- Siu Mai
- Steamed Mixed Vegetables with Chinese Herb
- Steamed Squid in Shrimp Sauce
- Braised Beef with Raddish
- Chicken Steamed Bun
- Preserved Egg Congee

There are still other items I wanted to try. And of course I will be back for some good and cheap dim sum.

At this price, of course is cash only."}
{"text":"Came here during Chinese New Year with a friend who recommended this place.

We ordered 2 X 4 lb lobster specials along with several other dishes.

One of the orders was prepared fried with Maggi sauce which made it crispy and the other one was your regular green onion/ginger sauce."}
{"text":"im torn on my review over this place.  I have had 2 separate experiences.  

1. Dinner 
2. Dim sum   

i came here during their first couple of weeks of grand opening for dinner.  It was great.  the food was delicious.. oil was fresh (not all dark)  lobster, crab, fish, everything was fresh and tasty and good value.  i was ready to give 4/5 review...

i held back .. i waited and went for their dim sum several times following my dinner experience.

its all downhill from here...

time after time it has failed me... 

1.  Not so much the taste of the food (although it has gone down a bit)  the service is just horrid.   3 out of 5 times, i was placed in the room in the back and simply neglected and forgotten.  everyone in the room with me was the same.  you litterally have to go outside and waive someone down.

2.  Food litterally takes FOREVERRR to come out.  dont bother eating dim sum here if you dont have at least 2 hours to spare...  and expect some of the food not to come or at least not come until you ask for the bill.. then suddenly they wont bring you the bill and rush the order for you.

3. quality of the food - when they first opened, they had this mini fish market thingy where fish was on ice and fish tanks were clear and seafood was healthy.

now?  omg... fishes all have mould and sickly cancer or something growing all over them... out of the fishes in the take.. at least 2-3 fishes had no eyeballs... 
the fishes looked mutated..  3 fishes were upsidedown and put new meaning to \"struggle life\"  

what happen?  i posted the pics in the picture section.. please have a look and if someone can explain to me if its safe to eat fuzzy fish and why these fishes are missing eyeballs.. 

i really want this place to do good.. the prices are good.. but they need to step up their game."}
{"text":"Love the dim sum, some of the best around.  Sorry the restaurant is soon closing for good to make room for CONDO project. Look forward to New Location in the New Year !"}
