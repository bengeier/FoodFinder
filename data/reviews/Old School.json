{"text":"The food and drinks great. The service, not so much. A table was sat 5-10min after to us, they got their water, drinks and special told before we even got water or any drink menus. Same server. My drink came half way in to my meal. I've been here a few times and the food is always delicious. It's the only reason I return."}
{"text":"Wanted to try brunch at old school for a long time, but I think it was a mediocre, though the food looks good for pictures lol"}
{"text":"Poor and bland food. I'm here for brunch and ordered the standard. My eggs weren't runny, I needed butter for my dry biscuit. Positives -good atmosphere and service. 

Update: I mentioned my concerns about food to the waitress who graciously gave me a few sweet treats from the general store. I must say that they were very tasty, especially the banana muffin. I changed my rating from a 1 to 3 stars."}
{"text":"Went with my family over the long weekend and was extremely pleased that they were able to take reservation (something that seems almost impossible to find in Toronto when it comes to brunch places).

I ordered their standard breakfast. My over easy eggs were perfect, the cheddar choice biscuit was awesome and the beans were super yummy. My bacon was also crispy (just how I like it) and their decaf americano was good too. 

I'll definitely be back to try the Eggs Benedict with pulled pork!! 

Don't forget, if you're there before 11am they only have their side entrance open. I've heard that a few people have thought the place was closed, but they apparently have just implemented being open 24hours!! Excited that I can get breakfast whenever I want now!!"}
{"text":"4 stars for service. 

2.5 stars for food. 

5 stars for decor. 

I really want to like this place.  Service is friendly and unpretentious.  Food is just disappointing though.  It looks great but tastes not so great.

2nd Visit
Smokey the Chicken was not smokey at all.  Dry.  Coleslaw was strange.  It was sticking together.  Friend across from me ordered ribs which were dry.

1st Visit
Portions are generous and the quality seemed consistent across the dishes I sampled from my friends plates. Overall though the food lacked punch. It just lacked a bit of finish. For example my chicken and waffle was soggy. My friends pulled pork was cold and dry. It was still tasty but just wasn't quite right."}
{"text":"I booked a table for 10 on a Saturday night  and the whole group was very impressed!  Good cocktails (although the drinks service was on the slow side) and the various smoked meats were delish!  The pulled pork was my favourite, you could tell it was properly smoked and not just done in the oven and then doused in smoky BBQ sauce like some restaurants do.  Good brisket, yummy ribs, and gooey mac and cheese.

Planning to try brunch this weekend!"}
{"text":"Meh ya it was ok. Went for brunch on a Sunday. Decor is cool, wait staff is awesome. We got the standard breakfast and the pulled pork Benny. Both were alright, maybe not amazing at this price range. I think the pancakes or chicken and waffles would be a better idea for something special. I could see it being fun with a big group of friends to enjoy the ambiance."}
{"text":"Saturday night. 9:30 PM. Not busy. 

Waited 20 minutes for the server to take our drink order. 

Watched our drinks sit at the bar for 10 minutes until the hostess brought it to us. 

Attentive hostess and drink was good. 

Needs some work."}
{"text":"Does this look appealing in anyway ?? Seriously.  Dry. Nasty Pork. Not pulled. They should call it CHUNK FAT. not pulled fuck all. Garbage. And look at th eggs. You can tell by the photo. They're not soft poached eggs. They wer fully boiled.  My yolks wer Hard as F***. I could go on for days about the poor service bad food. But I'll just say this. I asked for more eggs on the side. With runny yolks to add to top off my dry ass nasty CHUNK PORK (pulled)  and they brought me and over done. FRIED EGG!!!  OVER DONE!!  Hard!  

I'm sorry. But if you can't cook an egg. 

Get out of the brunch Biz. 

Worst !! 90$ for two people 

Blueberry pancakes wer ok

Dry too. But they weren't to bad. 


Baked beans !!  THEY WER FROM A F* CAN!!

Insane!? 100$ for brunch and you can't make your own baked beans ??


I posted a pic. Take a look for yourself."}
{"text":"The food is inconsistent; I've been 3 times and sometimes it's great, sometime not. The service however , as at Brad's former restaurant, is consistent -- consistently bad. I expected a bit more from this place, hopefully they'll up their game soon."}
{"text":"I came here for a Sunday brunch and given how popular this place is, we waited about 30 mins before being seated. We ordered the Latka Benny which was great and the blueberry pancakes. I was expecting the blueberry pancakes to be fluffier but found them quite dense and heavy. Given how popular the blueberry pancakes are here, I wasn't too impressed. However the latka Benny did not disappoint. The latkas were well cooked and eggs perfectly poached. Mimosas and Caesar topped off our brunch. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Service was friendly. Atmosphere was nice. I ordered the hickory chicken salad, which was a big mistake! It barely had any chicken on it and was literally a big tub of green. For a \"dinner salad\" and the $14 price tag, I would definitely avoid."}
{"text":"I don't usually give a 3 but it deserves it, place looked big on the outside but the sitting area was small, as well as the bar. Food was below average; ordered the Porky Pork Waffle, and my fiancée ordered the Hogtown BBQ Benny. Presentation was nice, taste was good, but when it arrived to our table it was warm, as if it was sitting under the lamp. I thought that the service was fine, servers were proactive but our cup was empty most of the time until we called them. 

Overall, our experience was OK.
Worth a try, sure."}
{"text":"The restaurant is bright and airy and the wait wasn't very long, which was a major plus. 
Came here twice in the past few months and ordered their Blueberry Pancakes, Chicken and Waffles, and a Brunch Poutine on the first visit, and then the Hogtown Benny and the Scrambled Delight du Jour.

Loved the Blueberry Pancakes, I finished the whole thing even though it was a lot of carbs and I was absolutely stuffed. 
The Chicken and Waffles were just ok, the waffles were sort of bland, and the Chicken was kind of over cooked. 
The Hogtown Benny was quite delicious, with the pulled pork adding a unique touch that worked well with the eggs benedict.
The Scrambled Delight was ok, can't remember much about it, so I guess I wouldn't order it again.

I would add this to my rotating roster of Brunch spots, and try out other dishes next time."}
{"text":"Got the \"Tweedle Dee\" sharing dish here recently. Full rack of ribs, half a smoked chicken, two biscuits and two sides (we got coleslaw and upgraded to get fries. Was a great value and my girlfriend and I are big eaters so it looked perfect.

The chicken was great. Very juicy and tasted really nice. They give you bbq sauce and (I think) chipotle mayo at the table so that really enhanced the flavour.The biscuits were also very good. 

It was nice that we were able to (for the extra cost) upgrade a side to a \"super\" side because the classic sides were ho-hum but the supers included fries. The fries were great but the coleslaw was mediocre. 

Finally the ribs: they were average at best. They tasted like something made at home rather than done at a bbq place, which may have been a result of such a varied menu and no specialization on bbq. Basically the ribs were dryish and without much flavour. The bottle of bbq sauce on the table really saved the ribs for me.

Overall it was a good experience, service was good and atmosphere was great.

TL:DR - great value, awesome chicken, mediocre ribs"}
{"text":"Walked in and tripped not once but twice on the uneven entrance. Oof! Bartender greeted us and sat us on the patio, with menus and went back to the bar to polish glasses or whatever they do when they aren't asking if they can get you a drink... we sat and took in the atmosphere, the ambiance, the décor, the view and about thirty other things while we waited and waited and waited for someone, anyone to drop by and say Hey! Six of those thirty other things were staff who never got close enough to call over without having to raise our voices or doing the annoying restaurant wave. So we waited some more. We turned it into a little game of How Long Do *you* Think.

Usually when you get a menu you can sort out what is on the cards and decide on your meal for the evening, drinks, whatever. Oh sure, you may have questions about some things, but in general the menu gives you the story. Not at Old School. I like barbecue and that was what I wanted. Brisket and some sides, maybe a couple of sauces. Nothing that you wont get at any place that BRAGS about their pit, which Old School does. So where on the menu can I find me some brisket? In a mess and maze of wordy condition, we finally find it under SIDES. WTF? BBQ is a side? 

Oh, and we were still waiting for someone to take a drink order. I figure I can ask about the brisket when that happens. Our wait person returns at a casual pace and we order two malted milkshakes, chocolate for me and strawberry for K. Off he goes. After another good opportunity to count the bricks in the wall, a different waiter approaches and deftly places a chocolate shake in front of me. He does the same for K, which is just wrong as she did not want chocolate. So K says that she ordered strawberry, and the waiter explains that our original waiter probably just double ordered the chocolate shakes by pressing the key twice on the screen, but that he will get it sorted out. It happens often enough that they know why it happens? Why not sort it out instead?

Our waiter appears and comes over with K`s shake and almost as an afterthought asks if we want food. I ask about getting brisket, and he explains that it is a side, I ask about getting it as a meal and he tells us he has to go check with the kitchen. Off he goes, and we wait some more. He returns and tells me I can order brisket and two sides for $15, which I do. K orders fried chicken. And then waiter is back to tell me that actually, I cannot have brisket and two sides for $15, the brisket is $15 and if I want sides they are extra. Okay, I have no problem with that except 1. The price for the brisket is nowhere on the menu and 2. I was told that Brisket and two sides would be $15. I ask how much, you tell me how much, I order. Make food, bring food, done deal. Not at Old School. Annoyed, I order a burger with fries.

We wait some more. The table behind us arrived, ordered and ate in the time it took to get our food. We would have asked about it but the staff were unable to make it all the way to our section of the patio. Not because it was crowded, or busy, or out of the way. They just seemed more interested in hanging out as far away from the customers as possible. Food arrives, and it is good. The burger is quite tasty, good texture to the beef and just slightly overcooked. The fries, however, tell a different tale. Did you ever go skiing in the 70's and get fries that came with that weird red spice shit that tasted exactly like weird red spice shit? Now I get what Old School means...

K's chicken is over-breaded and the paper placed on the tray disintegrates and becomes part of her meal. The coleslaw is good, though, and you do not have to ingest any part of the serving dishes along with it. She did get her shake, and they were good, although overly sweet and over priced by about $3.

This is getting long, but that is how our evening felt. Long. Drawn out. Tedious. We had to get up and go find someone to give us a bill, as our waiter had told us as he dropped our food that he had been there since 10AM (it was now 7PM) and was so tired he had to get home... so imagine our surprise when he was hanging out with the six staff by the cash, well concealed in the ''store'' section of the restaurant. None of whom seemed interested in helping us, so we asked the guy standing and looking at the cash register in what looked like horror and disinterest if we could please pay. He asked us for our bill, and K said, Well, no, no-one brought it which is why we were here, asking him for it. He gives us the wrong bill (he had three to choose from) and when we get the correct one it has a charge for brisket on it. He gets annoyed at having to take it off and I tell K I am going to be outside. Where I will remain for the rest of my days, as I will never set foot in Old School again.*

{"text":"Waiter had a bad attitude. We took a while to decide, which we thought wouldn't be a big problem since it was mid-afternoon and the majority of the place was empty, but I guess it was for him because he came up to us at least two or three times, looking and sounding impatient each time as he asked if we were ready yet. When we were ready to order, he asked \"So are you guys going to order anything at all?\" which sounded pretty rude. Also our food was sooooo greasy. I don't think any of us finished our plates. My friend's omlette had more cheese than eggs in it. Don't think I'll be trying this place again anytime soon."}
{"text":"Succulent ribs, delicious fries and smokey goodness.

Blueberry pancakes are incredible."}
{"text":"Ok. Let me first start with the food. This is some the best fried chicken I have ever had. We ate the sandwich and the fried chicken and waffles and both were spectacular.

Unfortunately, overshadowing the food was a pretty abysmal performance from front of the house. The menu is confusing as heck. Some items are only for dinner, others only brunch, and some all day. The server explained this and then proceeded to point out between five and ten menu items that are not available. Then the drink menu was set on the table, telling us to ask for the beer selection. Upon asking we were told only PBR in a bottle because they have yet to secure kegs. I'm no beer snob and I love PBR, but I'm not sure why this wasn't settled before they opened their doors.

Our waitress disappears for ten minutes or so before she returns to take our order. The place is not busy, with maybe five tables and three servers. This is a theme for the remainder of the meal. 

With orders in we settle back to drink and chat. After fifteen minutes we have not seen our server at all. The manager comes out and kindly explains our food will be out soon, apologizes and with a wink says to talk to him when we want to settle up. Great, this is exactly what he needed to do. Our food is brought out, its delicious, and we decide we won't need to call on the manager when we leave. 

However, we still haven't seen our server and now can't get the bill. The manager walks by so we ask him and he gets a hostess to bring our bill. Full charge for everything despite the aforementioned wink and we leave the money on the table not having seen our waitress for almost thirty minutes.

New restaurants have growing pains, but Old School is not trying hard enough."}
{"text":"Had dinner with 2 others. General fried chicken and waffles barely cooked and tasted mouldy. The main general chicken with coleslaw and potato salad also terrible. The layered fries were good. Butcher's crack was 3 pieces of very skinny bacon. I was expecting butcher bacon not packaged bacon. It was $5.00 and zero value for money. Also had the one hot mess which was a sweet potato with pulled pork, cheese and jalapeño sour cream. 90% of the meat was pure fat but the sweet potato itself was good. It was not worth $10.00 though. The total was 120 with tip for the tree of us. One of the most disappointing dinners in Toronto. I wouldn't give 1 star but I needed to so o could post a review. I do not recommemd"}
{"text":"First time I tried to come here, they had some maintenance closure and didn't even have a sign on the door up. There was a line of ppl waiting past 9am, so I called up and then was told it was closed. Place was closed for a few weeks after that too, so I was looking forward to trying Old School for a while!

Seems like they got everything worked out, came @ 11am on a Sat. Place was very busy, but we got a seat and had a super nice server. Food wait was a bit long, 30-40 minutes, but the quality was very good. Had lemon pancakes, mac and cheese, home fries, and person with me had fried chicken sandwich.

Mac and Cheese it masterful. Very well done. Home fries are perfect too...... but the pancakes, I got issues. If you look at their promo shots, and a lot of insta pics, their pancakes are super super fluffy and pillowy. Like 2x the height of a regular pancake. This is my thing, love pancakes like this so I was really excited to see what they are doing @ Old School. However when I got my pancakes they were thin and a little chewier than most pancakes. Was very disappointed. They were ok, the ingredients were all good and the flavor was there it had a very nice traditional flavor, but texture was a big miss. I don't want to sound too entitled, they were jam packed and obviously super busy, but hey if you don't hear criticism how do you fix stuff right?

Will for sure give Old School another shot some time soon to see if I just came at a bad time. Again food is super good quality and staff is A+++++++++."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were here last night for dinner. Kind of stumbled upon it as we were in the area for something else. 

I thought that the menu was interesting and the restaurant itself is very modern so I was expecting the food to be really delicious... Unfortunately I didn't think it delivered. 

I ordered the omelette with sausage and potatoes and goat cheese. The omelette was fluffy but literally had no seasoning - no salt or pepper. It was like the egg patties they serve at subway for breakfast. There was a couple slices of sausage and little potato. The only taste came from the little bits of goat cheese inside. The potatoe, sausage, and goat cheese was also not cooked in with the egg - it was kind of put inside like a taco or burrito.... Weird. 

The mixed greens on the side was nice but had no dressing. I had to ask for extra on the side. The buttermilk biscuit itself also had to flavour... No salt. I was honestly really surprised because the dseemed really ambitious. 

My partner had the fried chicken sandwich and it was also underwhelming. The only thing that we liked was the chipotle mayo they have in the condiment caddy at the table. But you had to use all of the condiments to give your dish some flavour. 

The only good thing we had was the beer! Some unusual beers I hadn't heard and it was nice to try something new. 

The dessert sounded great but I was afraid of spending $10.00 on something really boring and bland. 

It's too bad because this place has a great look but I definitely wouldn't go back or seek out this place. The price was definitely over estimated for the quality you receive. 

Maybe we made a bad choice in ordering but we really didn't order anything complicated. 

Save your money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great spot for late night eats... Menu is a bit confusing at first but the food is solid. Great location."}
{"text":"Food was really good! We ordered the lemon meringue pancakes  (5 in an order!) And the poutine .. huge portions! Good service and not too long of a wait for a table. The only downside is the wait for food.. took over 30 minutes after we ordered. Other than that id definitely go back."}
{"text":"I love this place. The blueberry pancake is amazing. My bf had ch n waffle which also is very tasty. Service could be improved tho"}
{"text":"This is a new restaurant that opened on my street, and I have to say I was super impressed. The service was great, and the food was fantastic and really flavourful. I suggest trying the fried chicken sandwich, it was absolutely delicious. I will definitely go back again! They also have a general store where you can purchase their smoked meats, old fashioned soda, and other items. Of the smoked meats, the pulled pork is great. They also have a very nice patio for warm summer days."}
{"text":"Almost didn't give this place a try because there were so many negative reviews. But the menu is right up my alley so I thought I'd be the judge. And I'm glad I gave it a try! 
Had the standard breakfast with a single pancake on the side. Everything was delicious! I loved my cheddar biscuit! The breakfast beans were really good too. But the highlight of my meal was the bacon and the pancake! I will definitely be back, there were so many delicious options and I want to try them all! Service was really good too!"}
{"text":"place was nice and cute, came here on a tuesday morning and there was almost no one with was nice. the waiter was very nice. ordered the blueberry hill pancakes. very filling, wasn't able to finish because there was so much but it was too sweet for me and i just did not like it. eating something that sweet in the morning did not make me feel great. i'm sure the other things on their menu are better but sadly i will not be coming back for more."}
{"text":"Got mac and cheese, good thing it was only $10 because I couldn't finish it. It was OVER-THE-TOP greasy and salty.

Everything else looked average. 2 thumbs down"}

{"text":"Wow!! Amazing food. Such a nice place inside and out and everything is so tasteful. What I recommend to order is there standard breakfast and their hamburger and fries. There theme is very old school and there Coke is just like he olden days but overall 4 stars but this is because the desert at the end took very long to take out and they were out of a food I wanted"}
{"text":"I ate supper here and really liked it! Fun menu options, nice decor an a cool vibe. Highly recommend the boozy milkshakes!"}
{"text":"Cool looking space, friendly service.  We went with a group for Saturday brunch. I was surprised by how empty it was. When we checked out the menu online, I envisioned a long line up. We all ordered coffee, that was the first bad impression. The coffee tasted funny. The entire group could not pinpoint exactly what it was.  We questioned if it was goat milk, if the creamer was bad, turned out the coffee was just poor tasting - weak and sour, almost goaty.  I ordered the hog town Benny, it was just alright and came with greens and a cold potato salad. Two people at the table had to return their orders.   
The one order was the cheesy stuffed french toast.  It was completely raw inside. When a new order came, we all tasted it and it was really good.  The problem seems to be that the bread itself is very very thick.  It's basically a loaf of bread on your plate. Then came the real ALARM,  chicken and waffles, the chicken was raw in the centre not just under cooked.
What's worse is that they tried to tell us it was just the colour of chicken thigh meat and brought it back - which means no one in the kitchen understands the health concerns.  And a customer that doesn't know about proper cooking techniques could get seriously sick - hello anyone ever heard of salmonella.  I was on the fence about returning, maybe it would be a group brunch thing once in a while for kicks - but I can't go back."}
{"text":"Such a cool restaurant. The place was deserted as we arrived at 9PM on a weeknight but that didn't kill the vibe too much. Loved the rye and ginger cocktail. Had the hangover lovers salad and loved it, the corn bread could've been more prominent because it was basically just crumbled over the top but other than that it was top notch!"}
{"text":"The actual restaurant is nice enough, trendy with a comfortable layout. When I walked in I wasn't planning on having my mind blown, I haven't really heard rave reviews but me and my significant other thought we would give it a try. Worst meal I've had in Years!!! Absolutely disgusting it came out cold the fried chicken we ordered smelled \"very off\" and was slimy and Luke warm at best, when we asked our waiter about the smell he said it's because they cook it in buttermilk it smells like that?! 
I've had buttermilk fried chicken a hundred times and I've never experienced a smell like that before. 
The baked beans were completely raw & cold the only thing that was edible was the Mac & cheese and the baked potato and both were nothing to write home about (also room temperature)
I'm sorry not being able to eat 3/4 of a meal because it's not cooked properly or not even cooked at all and then being asked to pay full price is absolutely ridiculous... 
Will NOT be returning...."}
{"text":"Old School was the perfect spot for us to try for Sunday brunch when the wait at Saving Grace seemed impossibly long. Great big patio and we didn't wait for a table at all when we got there at 11.

Menu looked amazing! Every single item on the brunch menu sounded awesome. Someone in the kitchen is a creative mind. All the plates that came by to other tables looked amazing too!

Service was straight up bad. It took about 30 minutes for us to get our coffees, and that's after the waitress brought someone else's drinks first. Our food was delivered to the wrong table twice by two different servers - even the one who took our order. When our food did come, it was cold. 

The food itself was delicious but I was put off by the time it took to come and the fact that it wasn't hot at all when it arrived to our table.

I'm willing to try this restaurant again if they sort out the issue with their disorganized service."}
{"text":"This is about your UberEATS situation. You forgot my coffee, not a big deal! I called just to inform you and your GM tried to throw the uber driver under the bus and that is why I'm writing this review. NOT COOL. An apology goes a long way. As someone who also works in a restaurant that works with UberEATS when we fail to give a driver something, that's on us! I have literally, personally, ubered items to people because it was our fault. That said, the food was unseasoned and inedible. It was disgusting! I truly regret even giving this place a shot. Also thanks for the minuscule amount of hot sauce, is this a joke in the kitchen?"}
{"text":"If you like sweet fried chicken and pay unexpected amount of money .... Interiors is great though"}
{"text":"We loved the food at old school and can't wait to go back! We went with a group of 7 for brunch and had the opportunity to try many things on the menu.

Don't even go there which was the French toast stuffed with cheesecake was yummy.

The poutine was delicious and the gravy was so good I wanted to bottle it and take it home with me.

The Mac and cheese cobbler had the perfect crispy top and decadent gooey inside.

The chicken and waffles was a great blend of sweet and savory with a little kick.

We had both the banana and blueberry pancakes which were light and fluffy and the blueberries and sauce tasted fresh and sweet while the banana had a great textured outside.

Finally, we had a potato latkes with smoked trout, pouched egg and an avocado hollandaise that was delish and the egg was cooked to perfection with the yolk oozing out when I cut into it.

Although we were stuffed, we had very large chocolate chip cookies for dessert which were especially a big hit with the kids!
 
The service was great and attentive. The vibe was cool and it was fun to watch people and their reactions to the unique dishes and presentations as the food came to the tables.

We highly recommend Old School and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We were craving BBQ so we headed over to Old School on a Sunday night.  The service was friendly and very attentive.  Very impressed with the food quality and the portions which were reasonable but not gargantuan.
Tried the pulled pork sandwich accompanied by a mixed green salad and potato salad.  Yum!
They offer different BBQ sauces which you can add on to the meat however, it really wasn't necessary as the pork itself was tender with a great smokey flavour...and I'm not a big pork fan.  Another bonus, the meat is slowly smoked so it comes out tender, full of flavor and completely ungreasy.
Also tried the half rack of ribs which is cooked with a dry rub.  Again these were delicious and could have been eaten sans sauce. Meat was tender, smokey and with not a lot of fat. Sides ordered were the cheddar biscuit and the baked beans - both well done.  Just don't expect the usual goopy sickly sweet baked beans you find in other BBQ joints- these were excellent with just enough sweetness.  
If you're a fan of authentic BBQ, would definitely recommend a visit here.  
We'll be back for sure next time we need a meat fix!"}
{"text":"what can I say... Food was good..  

yelp wants me to edit my reviews.. none of my reviews are ever recommended so screw you Yelp..


Old School was great.."}
{"text":"Really disappointed with my entire experience at this restaurant. They were out of various menu items (like.. 1/4 of the menu) which we eventually got over. But when I asked to substitute with another protein they said it would be an up-charge. Under what circumstances is in my fault that you don't have the original menu item? Why would I pay more when that's not what I originally wanted?

When we finally ordered and the food came 30+ minutes later it was mediocre at best. Nothing too special, though the price was reasonable. The waitress was accommodating, especially when she brought the wrong dish for my friend and had a new plate quickly made. By the end, it was pretty clear she was less than pleased to be serving our table. 

Essentially this is the perfect example of a \"hipster, artsy, modern\" restaurant that looks pleasing at first glance but is ultimately disappointing and unsatisfying. You'd think there would be some kind of compensation for ordering plates without the meat included on the menu or getting the wrong dishes but no, there is clearly a lack of business etiquette in this establishment and I highly advise anyone to rethink their dining options."}
{"text":"I reserved the day before and was surprised to get a table for 4 on a Sunday morning at 10am! I was very pleased as this was my first visit. 

Place was not too busy and we ordered right away: smoked salmon Bennies & blueberry pancakes. Alcoholic beverages were a tad expensive.

Great portions, friendly service and decent prices. Food was good but there was no wow factor. Also, nothing stood out from the menu as others have mentioned.

I would come back again if I ever need a last-minute reservation!"}
{"text":"Read about this place. Seemed good considering it was created by the same person who made school. Food was good not great. Atmosphere was good ..Would go back."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on Saturday at around 1pm. The hostess was really nice and would call you to let you know that your table would be ready in abt 20-40 mins. There's a coffee shop across the street or if you're feeling energetic you could walk down dundas st! Unfortunately for us, we went on the coldest day of the month (-25!!!) So after 5 minutes, we scuttled back into the warm resto. 

Lemme say that ever since the first time my friend and I came here at 3am for some late night munchies, (Yessss they're open 24/7!!) We have been meaning to come for brunch! 

We ordered the valentines special - salmon Benny with avocado hollaindaise sauce . mannnn oh man. It was delicious!! Just like a regular eggs Benny but w super creamy avocado sauce and smoked salmon ! Def our fav. 

We also ordered the general fried chicken and waffles cuz it Loooks sooooo good!! Almost every other brunch table had that dish. I'm a huge fan of CnW.. However this one was alright.. We were a little bit disappointed bc it only came with one piece of fried chicken and I thought the batter could have more flavor. Waffle was regular sized. The honey Tabasco sauce was also supppper spicy! So be careful!! You'll definitely need a sauce since the waffle is a bit dry but don't go too crazy. We don't eat super spicy food so our taste buds were prolly not used to being on fire. 

Next time, I'm sticking w the French toast with cheesecake in the middle (ABSOLUTEEEEE FAV) !! Or try their BBQ!!! 
Dont worry, I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"A little pricey but really good breakfast food. Both the blueberry griddle cakes and the bbq eggs benny are delicious + the spicy honey is great. Servings are generous too"}
{"text":"Ended up at this place after not being able to go to School at Liberty Village a couple of weekends ago.  Worked out great since we now know of a place that had a similar menu but is open 24/7.  Since it was also our first time here, we decided to order a few things and shared them.  I normally take pictures but we were so hungry that we dove right in especially since everything looked so great! 

All American French Toast - Just what I was craving and was incredibly satisfied.  The portion is quite big so it's shareable. The meal also came with mixed greens which balanced the meal out nicely.  5/5.

Old School \"Classified\" Burger - Was a very simple burger yet the patty was very juicy and had enough flavor.  Was a crowd favourite, for sure. Wish that it was a little larger but otherwise, I'd order it again. 5/5.

Bucket-O-Shrimp - Shrimp were perfectly cooked with also the right amount of butter.  The pretzels it came with was a nice touch. Was a little on the pricey side considering its portion size, though.  If it had cost a little less, I'd order it again.  Still very good though. 4/5."}
{"text":"Food is amazing but the measuring cups on the chalk board are drawn in backwards order where they couldn't possible fit together and it disturbed my eating experience more than you'd expect - hit me up on Soundcloud if you need someone to come fix that (@benvanderger)"}
{"text":"2.5 stars.

I found out about this place after seeing the most amazing pictures of the Blueberry Hill (griddle cakes with blueberry). My friend was making an impromptu visit to the GTA, so I figured it would be a good time to try their brunch. Well, we arrived around 1:45 and we were seated around 2:45, but it was my first meal of the day and I ordered a waffle, so I'm still calling it brunch.

I ordered the brown sugar bacon and banana brûlée waffles with a side of sugar cured smoked bacon because... bacon. Also, I was intrigued by that fact that it was also called \"butcher's crack.\" It was OK. The waffle was nice and eggy, but nothing special. The bananas were anything but brûléed... a more accurate description would have been \"battered and fried.\" The bacon had a nice sweet-salty-moky balance, but for whatever reason, I was expecting candied thick cut bacon and what I got was not that. I don't know.

Service was OK. Our server was pretty blasé and not very proactive. Water glasses were left near empty for quite awhile and our empty plates remained on our table until we managed to flag her down for the bill... which was a task in an of itself, as she was nowhere to be found.

TL;DR - long wait, average food, sub-par service"}
{"text":"Old school was a very interesting brunch. 

We had the Mac and Cheese, the French Toast and the cheesecake filled bread

French toast was thick and well prepared with great flavours and well balanced

The cheesecake filled bread was simply amazing, this is a must try! Decadent and making our brunch truly exceptional

The mac and cheese was forgettable. But the real disapointement was the service. Slow and our orders filled with mistakes. The manager personally apologize to us, but you know when you get to this point, its because you screwed up!

Well! Overall some of the food was delicious! Choose wisely"}
{"text":"I've only been here for their Brunch Service, and their Low 'n slow French toast ($16) is where it's at! 

They serve a homemade thick cut french toast and stuff it with pulled pork and bechamel sauce with smoked sugar topped with a fried egg. Just the description alone will make your mouth water, am I right? 

The service was impeccable and I highly suggest you make a reservation (total bonus that they do this). I was here at 10AM and the place was bustling already. 

Next time, I'll try out their famous pancakes, and provide an update!"}
{"text":"Had the daily special of Chicken,waffle,and poached egg. My husband had the pancakes with the bananas. The brunch meal was meh, not amazing like at other places. The women's washroom was absolute disgusting and no toilet paper in one stall and the other stall was broken! The pancakes were over done and \"their\" candied bacon was flavourless! Needless not ever going back!"}
{"text":"Fair warning, I'm from Texas so I'm really biased when it comes to BBQ.

That said, I was pleasantly surprised.  I haven't tried the brisket at any Canadian BBQ joints because I'm an uppity snob when it comes to delicious, slow smoked beef, but I did have the ribs.  They have that wonderful smokey taste that I love, although they weren't as juicy as I expected.  Flavourful, yes, but not what I'm used to.  I also tried the fried chicken sandwich, and it was great.  The piece of chicken they use is huge, although that can backfire as the sandwich might fall apart on you towards the end.  The shoestring fries are perfectly fried and nicely salty.  The mac and cheese is also very good.  My boyfriend tried the eggs benedict for dinner, and they were more than willing to leave the pork off of them, as he is a vegetarian.  

Service was a little slow regarding drinks, but they only have one bartender and two of us ordered cocktails, which slowed down the service somewhat.  It can get a little busy, but we managed to get a table for four with no wait.  

I'd try it again, especially for chicken and waffles."}
{"text":"Went here the other day for breakfast. Had the very yummy cheesecake filled french toast, the blueberry pancakes with bacon and then pulled pork eggs Benny. All items were large portions and very good. The toasted coconut cheesecake filled fresh toast was very unusual but worth it. A nice crunchy layer of coconut and a hidden pocket if rich warm cheesecake inside. The three dishes plus three coffees came to about $75 bucks which is a little steep for breakfast food. The place was clean and service was friendly."}
{"text":"Great, great food! Love the sweeter options here. I had the peanut butter pancakes, and the waffles the next time. The pancakes are some of the best I've had, and they don't skimp on the portion.

Service is nice too. Would love to go back at night, seeing as it's 24/7!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good! I ordered the \"That's All Right\" plate, which was pancakes, peanut butter sauce and a deep-fried banana. The peanut butter was only on one pancake so that was a little misleading; there was also supposed to be vanilla cream, but I never saw that. No worries, though, as it was still quite delicious & filling. 
Service was very nice. They were very attentive and friendly. 
Only complaint is the coffee. It was pretty overpriced for one small cup of coffee. I was never offered any refills (not sure if they have them) and it was still $3.00. But overall good experience!"}
{"text":"Once upon a time, I would bring everyone I knew to this restaruant for a fun-time and good brunch. Now, I never suggest it and refuse to step foot in again. 

The atmosphere is sort of fun-loving with a cute minibar at the front of the restaurant and seating arrangements spanning from patio, main floor and second floor. 

The service is almost non-existant...You have a server appear once and then never again. You are perched or famished or something but no one is in sight...You can hear staff laughter or see them sipping on a beverage while you try to control your own thirst for water or coffee or tea. If you have a table to wait on, why are you not doing so? Of course, I am not suggesting to constantly be on the lookout for what to do for your customers but some semblance of thoughtfulness of bringing over the menu or a glass of water really goes a long way!

The food is inedible. My go to was always the Blueberry Hill. However...Once it was slightly burned which I excused and simply ate. The second time was completely burned. Each pancake was covered in burnt pieces of dough...There was an attempt to conceal it with more blueberry compote but failed miserably. I had asked to replace it and was denied. This ties back to the notion that customers are not the priority here but rather maintaining a relaxed attitude is. Again all we diners ask is that our food is cooked well (or even decently or maybe even considered edible) because we pay for your services and your food. You hurt your customer's trust in your product by displaying certain things and frankly, this is not my recommended anything anymore."}
{"text":"This is sad!!!! Our party of 8 came in and got told It would be a 30 minute wait so we split up 4 and 4. But we still got charged 18% gratuity even though our party was split up??? First weird thing. 
We got told half of the menu wasn't available... making the options limited. The substitutions for the missing menu items (like they did not have pulled pork so subbing it with chicken... etc) was an extra cost.. but why are you going to charge extra for subbing an item because it's not on the menu? I chose a bbq pulled pork Benedict however there wasn't any pulled pork left (and I'm vegetarian) so I got it plain and made It clear. So when my food came out... it had pork on it! They said there wasn't even any pork left but somehow it was on my sandwich. So strange. 
I think because I am American I have extremely picky opinions about how I am served and things of that sort.... but overall this experience was off putting. I would not recommend coming here. Food was mediocre tasting"}
{"text":"Love the interior and the location. It's not as pretentious as some of the other brunch places around the area. The price is reasonable and the coffee is decent. We ordered the Hogtown Benny, French Toast and Latka Benny.  We thought they were all great. Good level of spice and nothing was too soggy. Come before noon or after 1pm to avoid line ups.  When the patio is open, it helps alleviate a lot of the queue."}
{"text":"We ordered the blueberry hill, the southern fried chicken and the strawberry milkshake. Got here at 4pm in Sunday, it wasn't busy at all and that was perfect.

The blueberry hill was amazing the first few bites. It was SO sweet! After a while, it got too much.
One person cannot and should not finish it by themselves. The southern fried chicken was also good but the chicken to waffle ratio was not good. It was one small piece of chicken for a huge waffle.

The server was really nice and I loved her! Our water could have been refilled more but that's not a big deal.

I liked the restaurant and the location. I've just never ate so much sugar in one sitting..."}
{"text":"Omg absolutely delicious!! 
Be sure to get there early especially on the weekends because the brunch line is insane, although totally worth the wait. 
The bakery basket changes everyday and when I went there was nothing in there that I didn't like. The blueberry staked pancakes are just amazing. The iced coffee was good had an interesting cardamom syrup giving it a good twist. 
My sister had one of the omelets which was great but the corn bread (bread roll thing) was kind of dry. 
Don't underestimate the portion sizes!"}
{"text":"Very poor service. I ordered toast with my meal and it took them about 20 m to get it ! My food was cold by that time and I left without eating anything. Staff didn't apologize for it and I was not compensated. 
Will not come back again ."}
{"text":"Cool decor with a kick-ass huge serving of Chicken and Waffle!! Get here early to avoid the wait."}
{"text":"Great new restaurant. Love the fresh baked muffins, cheesy omelette, home fries, and Mac 'n cheese. The food is similar to School in liberty village and doesn't disappoint. Patio is really nice and shaded. Only been here twice at off hours but was still Surprised this place wasn't busier. Given the quality of food and service, I'd expect it to be packed any time of day!"}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this brunch place out for a while now. So I was really excited when our foodie friends decided on this restaurant for our brunch meet up! Everything was ok, until my food came. I ordered the Hogtown BBQ Benny. It came with pulled pork, which is suppose to be tender. But it was like chewing on sun dried eraser bits. Some of the pulled pork had cut the insides of my mouth too because it was so dry and hard. The cheddar chive biscuit that the poached egg is on, was pretty much like a brick.  I could not cut through it. They had burnt the bottom of it, so it was rock hard. We had to ask the servers to bring another edible biscuit twice because the first server completely forgot. The second biscuit they brought, was almost ice cold in the middle.  At this point I just wasn't hungry anymore. We really tried to enjoy the food but the disappointing quality of the food and service just wouldn't let us. We might give this place another chance in the future when they have these problems sorted out."}
{"text":"I got the BBQ benny (pulled pork eggs benedict on a chive/cheddar biscuit) with a side of salad (balsamic/vin dressing) and sour potatoes or apples....16$ before tax and tip. Severely overpriced and plate was lukewarm. Friend got the standard breakfast set and plate was also just OK. 

should have the food piping hot, and one of my poached eggs were actually cooked the whole way through....not sure how one was OK and the other wasn't unless they were prepared at separate times..."}
{"text":"A very decent brunch option where you can get a seat and is family friendly. A much better option than lining up for he place up the road."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic place to go! I spent a good 45-60 minutes eating really delicious food. It's vibrant, bright, modern and a little hipster. There are different menus on weekends and weekdays, night and day.

The servers are nice and service is moderately fast. The food came out within 15-20 minutes from when we ordered it.

The menu was neat and easy to read. There's a lot of really good stuff on the menu(I have to come back and try them all). The adult milkshakes were made really well, I recommend trying those if you haven't already.

We ordered the HOGTOWN BBQ BENNY which is an eggs Benedict on some biscuit with spicy hollandaise sauce and little dressed greens and potatoes on the side. The eggs were said to be soft poached but one of the two eggs were more like medium boil. I asked a server if the hollandaise was spicy, he said no with hesitation and it ended up being fairly spicy, but other than that everything was well.

We also ordered the CLASSIC FLUFFY FLAPJACKS which was absolutely incredible. Blew my pants off. 

I recommend trying the adult milkshake and fluffy flapjacks."}
{"text":"Opened 24/7?? WHY have I not discovered you sooner?

Came here for Brunch for two on a Sunday, although I don't know if it would still be considered as Brunch if we were eating our first meal of the day at 3:00 pm. 

We ate: 

1. THE REAL McCOY  (~$28): spare ribs, pulled pork, brisket, Kansas slaw and a cheddar and chive biscuit. If you've had a serious workout and looking to make gainz via protein intake, order this protein trifecta. It's a generous sample of all three of their southern meats.  

Now let's break this bad boy down: 

Ribs (4.5/5)- Let's start with the ribs, they weren't fall off the bone, but close enough.  Lightly dressed in BBQ sauce, but if you want to sauce out don't worry, they give you a whole BBQ tube to squirt until your heart's content. 

Pulled pork (4/5)- nicely shredded, crispy and full of BBQ flavour.  Although not overly sauced, we found the pulled pork to be a bit dry, perhaps the pork had been cooking longer than ideal or we got the remaining bits as a result of our late dining time. Still good. 

Brisket (2/5) - comes in two thick and buttery slices, and when I say buttery I literally mean you're eating two thick slices of 90% brisket fat. This could be heaven for a few, especially if you regularly enjoy eating fatty pork belly. Otherwise, the texture may be too oleaginous for most. The 10% meaty parts were tasty and tender, so I'll give some credit to that. 

Cheddar and chive biscuit - fluffy on the inside with a light crisp on the outside, very savory, and worked as a good balance to help neutralize the fatty brisket. 

Kansas Slaw - good old slaw worked as a nice pallet cleanser, not overly dressed. We liked it. 

2. HOGTOWN B.B.Q. BENNY (4/5) ($16):  2 poached eggs with pulled pork stacked on a cheddar and chive biscuit, smothered in hollandaise sauce with a side of potato salad and green salad. 

It was our first meal of the day so we had to have something with eggs in it. The poached eggs and hollandaise sauce were on point. The yolky poached egg survived the transport from the large plate to our smaller sharing plates, so you know it was cooked perfectly. The combination of everything was great. As noted above, the pulled pork was dry, but in this case the yolk and hollandaise sauced helped mask that. 

We also really liked the potato salad, the potatoes were boiled well and had a nice chew to its texture. This salad was also perfectly sauced. 

Summary:

Food (4/5) - See ratings above. Southern BBQ heaven with your own squeezable BBQ sauce tube. 

Service (10/10) - Water service was on point. Waitress checked on us frequent enough and really made us feel like she cared about how we were enjoying our experience.

Atmosphere (10/10) - Lots of seating available, great for family and kids and relatively quiet. Décor is very intriguing and there is a real \"grocery store\" in the back where you can purchase fresh pastries and sauces. 

This may be my new late night go-to.  Sweet, smoky southern love at 3 am? I'll be there and so should you. 

Eat here."}
{"text":"Probably one of the most overrated brunch spots in the city. I've been here about 4 times over the last year because other friends have wanted to go, and the most recent time was the worst.

AMBIANCE: The table we were seated at inside had a gross amount of fruit flies flying around it. We asked to move outside but we warned the patio has wasps. We moved to another table inside and there were just as many fruit flies.

WAIT TIMES: We waited to get a table but that's normal for brunch. It did however also take a long time for our food to arrive (30 mins at least) so there was a lot of time to notice how sticky the table was. We each received our food at different times. Mine was the last to arrive yet it came completely cold.

FOOD: I ordered the Blueberry Hill pancakes. Pancakes + bacon are pretty hard to screw up because they're so delicious but the bacon was undercooked (what brunch spot serves chewy bacon?! everyone knows a bit of crisp is where it's at), there wasn't enough syrup by any means and the pancakes were pretty dry and boring. They were also served in a cask iron skillet which 1) was ironic given that they were cold and 2) made them difficult to eat and while I was trying to cut into them all of the garnish fell off and onto the dirty table.

SERVICE: Our server never brought us our coffees. It took another 10 mins to get our bills after we asked for it yet there were at least 5 staff on the floor + a ton of empty tables.

PRICE: not worth it for what you pay (my bill was $25 for pancakes + a very mediocre ceasar with the most sad-looking (but yummy) marinated bean). Also not worth it even if it were cheaper.

There are a ton of amazing brunch places in Toronto + especially in that same neighbourhood. Go somewhere else unless it's late night and you're drunk and nothing else is open."}
{"text":"I'm coming again for brunch. I've already got it planned out. I'm going to get something that sticks to your insides for six months, filling you with syrupy, bacon goodness. We were lucky we scored bar seats right before it got packed on a Sunday morning. 

Brown sugar. Bacon. Banana. Waffles. Get them and don't share! We shared. Why did we share?! They were really fucking good. I got the latke benny for myself, which was very good; never had latkes made with white potatoes before. My Jew senses are telling me there's a goy in the kitchen making latkes, but I'll accept it because everything was great. Lots of coffee refills. Super friendly bartender who made just enough conversation. Patrons seemed pretty pleased all around. 

The curtain thing is kind of weird when you walk in, but I guess it did make sitting at the bar just a little bit more private. I think my next trip calls for a mimosa (bottomless? who knows!)."}
{"text":"This is one of my go-to places for brunch. Wait time here is usually a bit less than most places in Toronto. Food is consistently good, favourite dish would be their french toast!"}
{"text":"I am totally disgusted that Old School has ripped off art from Canadian Artist Kelly Mark!  You should be ashamed of yourselves!   The neon sign hanging in your restaurant is a flagrant theft of Mark's neon art from 2006 - \"I called shotgun infinity when I was twelve\""}
{"text":"Food = pretty solid 
Service = alright. 

My friend and I had the chicken and waffles. It was solid. LOTS of chicken. Soo much that we couldn't finish it all. But we really liked it. 

I like the vibe of this place better than the school in Liberty village. Line ups can get long but worth it."}
{"text":"Worst. Been here twice -- the first time, we waited 45 minutes for profoundly average food. The second time we sat at our table for almost an hour waiting for our food before we just got up and left, starving. It seems a lot of these reviews report inordinately long wait times (for those lucky enough to get some food at the end). It's bizarre how this restaurant, clearly aware of the issue, still chooses to cram people into every nook and cranny but doesn't hire additional kitchen staff. Terrible experience. Will not go back."}
{"text":"Old School (Toronto) 
Casual restaurant with an \"old school\" vibe(love the illustrations on the walls). Tons of space to come chill with friends and throw down some ribs. My pulled pork was good, but the sauce was a little on the sweeter side and I generally prefer more of a tang. I really enjoyed my cocktails and the baked potato was really good."}
{"text":"Came here the other day for breakfast and drinks. Everyone was so impressed. The service was fantastic. Our waiter was quick and very friendly. The food was to die for. I would recommend the blueberry pancakes. This place has definitely become my go-to spot whenever I am in Toronto!

Give it a try! You won't leave disappointed."}
{"text":"A long wait for the food, but well worth it.  The pancakes were smothered with fresh fruit, and the sausage is the tastiest I've ever had.  

The service is not great though.  The waitress forgot my drink, i had to ask for it halfway through the meal.  Then she brought the wrong one."}
{"text":"yay! another school. I love the spot in liberty village but the brunch rush always kept me away. 
The menu here is slightly different but of the same ambiance. It's delicious and indulgent brunch food served well. I haven't gone for dinner, only brunch. 

I had the pulled pork benny (meh- the pork was dry and the egg was well cooked! which they replaced with a runny one when I asked), but the french toast was killer! the candied bacon was also totally worth the visit. Would go back and try other things. 

Pork benny was meh but the french toast was heaven so it gets a 4."}
{"text":"The menu was nice and I loved the options that were offered. The restaurant was also very nicely decorated. They also offered a 10% discount if you post a photo on Instagram with them tagged.  Everything else about this place was poor quality. We had to wait for a table to clear up and then had to wait even longer for a server to get us menues. It seemed like he was also serving people in the very front of the restaurant which kept him on the opposite side of us... The restaurant was also full of gnats which got annoying very quickly. Our food was then brought out sporadically. My friend got get food first and I got a plate with my side order of eggs. By the time I got my pancakes she was almost halfway done with her meal. It also seemed like the kitchen got our orders mixed up with another table so they were a bit confused. 

Bottom Line: this place looks like a great brunch option but we ended up with a gnat filled experience with food that was average at best."}
{"text":"I ordered the smoked salmon salad and my friend had the mushroom toast - both were not bad, but nothing special. The decor is cute but I did not enjoy the service. Our waiter had little knowledge on the menu when we asked for recommendations and asked me to give her a larger tip when I was paying? I thought this was a bit presumptuous and rude to be honest considering that she barely waited on us. I would not recommend this restaurant and won't be coming back"}
{"text":"1 hr + wait, expect to see your server every 40 mins, soggy salad like it was sitting for awhile, mediocre brunch, not one to complain but wouldn't go back, giving 2 stars not 1 only bc server tried to make up for it with free treats, nice decor but food isn't anything special and service is terrible"}
{"text":"They are plagiarizing art. Knowingly. That's BS. They've stolen from Kelly Mark and don't really care. A mistake is fine, but rectify it - don't sit back and laugh. Other than that, it seems pretty cool - waffles and pancakes and stuff. Brunch is kind of silly anyway - go to Lakeview instead.   http://artfcity.com/2016/01/26/artist-uses-yelp-to-shame-plagiarizing-restaurant-and-wins/"}
{"text":"I hate to leave such a bad review for a place that I used to love so much. First of all, they changed their menu and took out some of the best items, including the cream cheese French toast, hogtown Benny and Mac and cheese. I ordered the chicken and waffles and they were very dry and not fluffy. They tasted stale like they were from the day before. Not to mention the chicken portion was very tiny for the price (it was the best part of the meal though) it costed 20$ for this meal which is very expensive for breakfast and not to mention breakfast that was not very good. I think they need to lower the prices and go back to the OG menu because people are going to be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great little place. I didn't like how dark the restaurant was...but the food was amazing! My fiancée and I ordered the General Crunch and we both LOVED it. The fried chicken was thick and really juicy. Absolutely recommend."}
{"text":"After a fantastic first experience I decided to come back to try their lemon meringue pancakes and I was sorely disappointed.  The pancakes were not the same fluffy ones I had the first time.  This time they were dry and the bottoms were burnt (my mistake not taking a picture of the bottom to show you).  How sad when my first experience was so fantastic.

But the real reason I'm giving one star now compared to four before, is because of the HORRIBLE service we received.  We were there around 830ish and there were only 3 other tables sitting beside us.  There were 2 staff working that night.  We asked for the bill and then both staff disappeared into the back.  A couple came in waited about 5-10 minutes with NO one coming to the front.  They decided to sit down themselves.  Then it must have been about 15 minutes later and they just decided to leave.  Finally someone showed up and he was busy clearing the table of another couple and then proceeded to help the guy sitting at the bar.  At this point is had been about 25 minutes that we were waiting for the bill and I literally had my arm extended (my arms are long) and waving in the air to get their attention for about 2 straight minutes.  Keep in mind that this place is NOT big and we honestly think the staff was purposely ignoring us or not looking in our direction because they were \"busy.\"  

Finally the guy comes over and says sorry he forgot to get us the bill. By this time a good 30 minutes have passed. He returns and we tell him we need the machine.  He comes back another 5 minutes later with the machine that does NOT work and says he has to get the other machine.  All in all it took about 45 mintues from the time we asked for the bill and then for us to pay and leave.  Completely outrageous considering the place was not even half full, but somehow the 2 staff seemed to be incredibly busy.  I'm sorry but wtf are you doing in the back for that long and leaving the restaurant completely unattended? 

By the way, we came for dessert and only ate the pancakes.  When you know you left customers waiting for 45 minutes to bring them the bill AND you and the other staff member disappeared to the back for over 20 minutes, I feel that you should offer some sort of discount.  Not that I expect free food, but I think it would have been nice for them to just comp the meal considering it was less than 20 bucks.

HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. Literally wasted my life coming here."}
{"text":"Went there last Friday for lunch with my family and everyone enjoyed their food. I had the mac and cheese which was good but I will definitely be getting the blueberry pancakes next time...they looked AMAZING! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Slow service really gets me. We were waiting for our table to be ready at a nearby restaurant and decided to pop in for a drink. It took so long to get our drinks that we had them for only a few minutes before we got the call our table was ready and had to leave. We were looking at a 45 minute wait! It probably took almost half an hour for 4 drinks to arrive, 3 of which were the same.

The drink I had (Friday night special) was absolutely delicious but the slow service hindered the enjoyment of the beverage."}
{"text":"Nice ambience , very nice and lovely service , food looks great but taste as good, it's still decent but not the best that you could get... I'll go back to give it another try! Wanna check their French toast and see how that one go as they were out this time"}
{"text":"Delicious menu, both for brunch and dinner. Love that they're open for 24 hours.

My only issue is them NEVER having the lavendar syrup for drinks :/ in all the times I've been there"}
{"text":"Went here on a weekday morning to meet with a friend and I'd say I had a pretty dang good experience!

We were there for almost three friggin' hours and were never made to feel pressured to order more or clear out. The server was helpful, as well as able to find that sweet spot between ignoring you and being annoyingly present.

The food worth the price in both quantity and quality. Unlimited tea/coffee refills were plenty welcome. Music wasn't too loud to talk or too annoying to ignore. Daylight filled the spacious main floor.

Really, the only nit to pick would be the unfortunate spacing between the two urinals in their men's washroom. If two guys had to go at the same time, the guy on the left would have to put his right foot under or on the left foot of the guy on the right? So yeah, a little more space might be wise but whatever, it didn't come up. Otherwise, it was very clean and pleasant in there.

The menu's a little cluttered, but having too much choice of too many exciting variations on traditional breakfast fare is a first world problem if there ever was one. Besides, the server was very helpful in pointing out specials and letting you know his personal favorites. Thanks to him I ended up getting a much more interesting meal - pulled pork, scrambled, biscuits, salad, and home fries - than the basic breakfast I'd been eyeing up; and I'm glad he did!

So yeah, no regrets. I'll definitely be coming back so I can continue to explore the menu."}
{"text":"Well, only a 2 ton 24/7 smoker can produce the good eats from this place.  Did the ribs, chicken, brisket and burgers...  Can't wait for the all day breaky/brunch..  The place is slick and welcome to Little Portugal..  Your smokin!!!!"}
{"text":"Was around the corner at studio bar one late night and was hungry so we walked to discover this 24 hr food joint. Wasn't expecting much except some decent quick food. Well we sure got less than what we expected. The place was not busy since it was around 1am, the service was beyond poor. Took over 40 minutes for the food, couldn't find a server in site to get our bill. Never returning back no matter how hungry and late it is."}

I'm usually not a sweet tooth in the morning and the pancakes were already off my norm... the other dish is just not for me in the morning, too sweet for me but my friend devoured it. I would probably eat it later in the day. But blueberry pancakes were AWESOME and had a side of sausage because needed something to balance out the sweet. The staff were super nice, especially the guy who brought out our food! We went early and it was raining so no wait time which made it even better."}
{"text":"Like many others, go by this place and always want to stop but can never get a table.  Yesterday, we FINALLY saw open seats so went in, only to be told by the waitress that food was an HOUR delayed.  NEVER GOING BACK AGAIN.  Not even when the place is PACKED should the service be an hour delayed.  So with open seating and this happening tells me something more is going on behind the scenes that I don't want to be part of."}
{"text":"If you're in a pancake/waffle mood and nearby, give this place a try! On entry the service was great. There was a bit of a wait for a patio table so we sat at the bar and the morning bartender was super cool and friendly.

The Food: Pancakes/waffle batter are really good and the portion size is worth the money. Honestly the toppings are nothing that I'd rave over. The dishes were a combination of mediocre toppings that when put together make a pretty good dish that's worth paying for because it's something you may not take the time to make at home. I ordered the brown sugar bacon and banana waffle. The fried banana had a bit too much batter for my taste and they could've added another strip of bacon since the dish is mostly sweet. The blueberry pancakes were pretty good. 
The presentation for the pancakes was super cute and fun! 

Somehow a table that ordered their food after us got there food first.. But I won't hold it against them."}
{"text":"I've had a few things on the menu here, I prefer the breakfast options, waffles with brule banana, oh yea delish.  But the cheese soufflé omelette, every bite was a delight"}
{"text":"Not awful, but I wouldn't recommend. I got mac n cheese cobbler, my friend the chicken and waffles; both were just okay. Waitstaff was wonderfully polite but food was just so overrated. Overall, I'd say you can get the same meals, but better and cheaper, elsewhere."}
{"text":"Our food arrived in a reasonable amount of time.  Our milkshakes arrived first.  Their milkshake was something I wanted to try because Heather had recommended their milkshakes and organic sodas to me.  I ordered the Vanilla one while my friend ordered the Maple one.  I was really, really impressed with how delicious it was!  The milkshakes came in adorable glass milk bottles as well.  The Vanilla one didn't taste too sweet at all while the Maple one was definitely sweeter.  My friend was really impressed with it too.

The General Chicken & Waffles were these golden waffles with general fried chicken on top, tabasco-pepper honey to go with it, and vanilla butter. It looked amazing with the fried chicken on top of the thick waffles. I could see the vanilla butter melting from the heat of the fried chicken. While I have had chicken & waffles that are more moist and tender, this General Chicken & Waffles from Old School was still very tasty and solid. The waffles were really thick and easily filled us up!

We ordered two sides: the Mac & Cheese Cobbler and the Smoked Sausage.  The Mac & Cheese Cobbler, as a side dish, was huge!  It could have been a dish by itself due to its sheer size.  It was \"ooey gooey elbows & cheese\", crispen, and buttermilk biscuit crumble.  It was very good macaroni and cheese and very, very cheesy.   I was glad that we were sharing it because there was no way that I could have finished the portion of chicken & waffles plus the Mac & Cheese Cobbler side.

The Smoked Sausage was smoked daily.  I enjoyed it.  It was a good texture of sausage and very meaty."}
{"text":"Despite it's trendiness, service was very good. All the servers were helpful, none of that 'i am not your server, don't bother me' crap. 

The space is large, patio is sun filled, the service is welcoming, all the ingredients of a good dining experience.

The food, however, is where it's lacking. The fried chicken needs seasoning, and for $20, you would expect more than just two pieces of thigh (with two small side). My friend had the quarter smoked chicken, and smoked, alright. it was smoked til it was dried. It was presented in a mini cast iron pan. which is charming, but how do you cut the chicken apart in such an awkward 'plate'? 

I would go back, especially with a larger group, as the space can accommodate large groups with short notices. But maybe I will eat something before hand and just grab drinks ?"}
{"text":"I forgot the name of the sandwich I had, but it contained fried chicken, bacon, coleslaw, and a spicy mustard/mayo. I thought the sandwich was great! I also had some of the Mac and Cheese cobbler. While I feel like I've tasted better, I thought it was pretty decent. 

Service was okay (we weren't served until at least 10 minutes after we got there). Since we were there at about 7 PM, they had dimmed the lights quite a bit to the point where I couldn't really see anything I was eating. They set out candles but it was still a little too dark. I know they were trying to set the late-night ambience, but they could've brightened up the place just a little more."}
{"text":"FIRSTTTT. So they have a cool menu very similar to school bakery and it just seems like a better and newer version!"}
{"text":"Eggs were not even close to being cooked. I literally put them in a frying pan at home (ordered uber delivery). They did not bother to separate my fruits from the rest of the meal so they arrived covered in beans. Overall, this is as bad as you can possibly do when it comes to bacon and eggs. 1 star because I can't give any less. I feel personally disrespected by this meal."}
{"text":"I had to write a review to warn other families to avoid this spot and save them from the frustrating situation that we had! We live in the neighbourhood and had tried this spot a few times. The food was average and service was slow, however we returned because they had a nice and spacious patio (on which they would accommodate our stroller). However, on our most recent trip for brunch the weather was cooler so we opted to eat inside. My husband, baby, and I waited for a table and were told by a hostess that it would be preferred if we left our baby's stroller at the front as there were was no room by the table. We were happy to comply, and took our baby out of the stroller and placed the stroller by the front window. After doing this, my husband was given the look of death by the bartender who abruptly told us, \"You can't put that there.\" When we apologized and asked where we should place the stroller, he replied, \"No where. No one's ever brought a stroller in here before.\" My husband and I were upset and shocked by the lack of customer service and understanding and decided to leave the restaurant. Particularly as the restaurant is located in a very family-centric neighbourhood with many young children nearby, we were upset by this terrible attitude. Terrible customer service. We asked to speak to the manager and were told that he was busy. We will not return and parents with babies beware!"}
{"text":"When I came here for brunch with friends, it was quite empty. Initially the servers kept coming back to ask for our orders, without giving us enough time to actually look through the menu. And after they took our orders, it was like they disappeared!

I found the design elements (industrial) to be lovely, but the food was just okay for me. The menu seems appealing, but as I do not eat pork, I found the options limiting for brunch without pork.

I ordered the an omelette dish that came with a delicious biscuit, some fruits and home fries.
My friends ordered the chicken and waffles and the eggs benny. Everything looked delightful. It also tasted delicious, if overfilling. We had to walk it off for awhile hehe.

I think I would come back to visit the General Store in the back of the restaurant, but as I found the options limiting (in terms of non-pork dishes) I probably wouldn't return to the restaurant itself. Still it was an enjoyable brunch."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch is always an exciting time for me.  As the previous nights' shenanigans begin to take their toll, finding a good brunch spot can make or break my Sunday. As such, when a place nails it, they REALLY nail it. Old School has REALLY nailed it.  With an atmosphere reminiscent of old-school diners (aptly named), complete with a bow-tied server, Old School serves classic dishes with a modern flair.
My friend and I both ordered The Standard (2 eggs, bacon, home fries, baked beans, a biscuit and a fruit cup; 12$).  The food came out quickly, leaving just enough time for me to order a Caesar.  At $9, the Old School Caesar certainly isn't cheap, but it is most definitely delicious.  A Worcestershire-forward Caesar with an in-house rim and just enough spice, this beverage kicked the experience into gear and set the tone for the meal to come.
What really sets breakfast places apart are the details, and Old School has them down to a T.  The home fries had a nice crispy exterior (a detail often lost at your more mediocre brunch spots), the baked beans were well-seasoned and had a certain unctuousness that can only be produced with the right amount of pork fat, and the bacon was the perfect balance of sweet and savoury.  What stood out most for me was the cheddar chive biscuit, which married the other components of the dish exquisitely.  
All in all our experience was as excellent as it was complete,  From the service all the way down to the crust on the potatoes, Old School is doing Old School right."}
{"text":"Good food but service is a little slow - although quite friendly when they get to you! I also spotted a little bit of dust on the tables which flew into my cup of water which was slightly unsettling but I imagine its an older place so I guess that's normal. Ordered the waffles with bacon and fried banana. The banana was a little dry and as I bit into it, a long piece of hair was in it. The food was replaced promptly which was good. Aside from that, everything else was good. Overall, not bad."}
{"text":"I have been to School for brunch on a couple of occasions, so when Old School (School's 24/7 sister) opened,  I was really excited to check it out. The staff are all so friendly and welcoming, and they made lots of helpful suggestions. The super kind staff member even gave us some biscuits to take home because we had gone in late (around 1:30/2am) and they were making fresh ones for the day ahead. The food was good, the service was great, and I'm sure I will be back to try more menu items!"}
{"text":"Walking around downtown just wanting a nice place to stop for some brunch. Ive heard a lot about old school but never actually had the chance to sit down and try it, so i said why not. I was seated at the bar and the waitress was very friendly. The menu was relatively small and didn't have very many options however everything that was on the menu looked delicious. 

The service was pretty slow in all honesty, i guess thats good who will be having drinks from the bar as it gave them more of a chance to sit and talk as they sip their drinks. When the food came the presentation was very nice and what you would expect of your typical small cute restaurant. The food was flavourful however it was a little underwhelming. The poached egg was slightly over cooked and wasn't as runny as it should have been, the fries were over salted, and the bun on the sandwich was so large it took away from what was on the inside. 

Overall the food was good and this is a nice place to stop off at if you are in the area, just don't think that you are going to be getting a perfect meal, but the food that does come out is still good and would make me go back again for a second time to try the other things on the menu i didn't get a chance to try again. Something like the blueberry pancakes looked great at the table beside me as well as the macaroni and cheese."}
{"text":"Really impressed - we haven't been downtown for brunch in a while, decided to check this place out before a Jays game. Small waiting area - but as a twosome was seated within 15 mins. Great menu variety - especially the couple different pancake options. I had the \"That's all right\" - and it was everything my pregnant belly wanted and more! Excellently cooked pancakes, perfect battered deep fried banana. Natural tasting peanut butter. The atmosphere seemed pretty chill, and service was very efficient. Would 100% go back for brunch again, or to try dinner!"}
{"text":"One of the cool things about this place is that instead of waiting in line, they can take your phone number and text you once your table is ready. 

I ordered the Classic Fluffy Flapjacks, the pancakes were moist, and the whipped vanilla cream was tasty. One of the pancakes at the bottom though, did not seem to be cooked through. I did notice that they were not many vegetarian friendly options in the menu, which was a little disappointing for me. 

Our server (Joseph) was very nice, and came to check on our table many different times. 

One of the biggest reasons why I did not give more stars its because the hostess was not friendly at all and dismissive as if she did not want my friend and I to stay."}
{"text":"Honestly I give 5 stars just because it was such a beautiful little restaurant and the service was great and the people were very welcoming. As for the food the chicken and waffles was delicious! And my friend who had the blueberry pancakes said they were absolutely amazing!"}
{"text":"I had checked the reviews before going, most specifically all the comments regarding the menu and how confusing it can be. I went there for brunch today and can confirm that these comments are true. The menu is divided in sections of items that are available on certain days/at certain times, so I made sure to look only at stuff that was available then. 

Once we made our selection, the waiter told us we could only order from the first column in the menu. What wouldn't you tell me that when you're giving me the menu? So we had to send the waiter away and start over. We wanted fried chicken but didn't necessarily want to order the chicken and waffles so we noticed you could order fried chicken from the general store, starting July 4. It's July 5th so we assume we can and ask the waiter for it. Once again, we are told we can't. Why write that something is available at a certain date when it's not???

We end up settling for the chicken and waffles and the blueberry pancakes. Even though the chicken and waffle was good, I feel like you're kind of taking your customers for idiots when you give them ONE piece of fried chicken, especially when you're charging $19 for it. Hello, rip off! Do yourself a favor and go to Stockyards if you want chicken and waffles with a decent amount of delicious chicken for even cheaper.

The blueberry pancakes were good but overall, the experience wasn't so I won't be going back. I would've given 2.5 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Haven't been to old school in awhile, but I always had good memories of the food. 

Bf and I tried it out for Saturday brunch and noticed that the food quality has gone down sooooooo much since we last came. Maybe they changed management or changed head chefs.... the biggest disappointment was the burger. Omg. I used to come to this place just for their burgers and thought it was honestly one of the best burgers in the area.... but when I ordered one today it looked like a sad overpriced day old Quarter pounder from McDonald's. I'm not even exaggerating it was tepid and almost made me want to throw up. Could not even touch it....

The saving grace  of this place was the server Danielle... only reason this review is 2 stars and not 1 star. She made the most out of a bad situation by offering me a free muffin and taking the burger off our tab while being super nice and understanding!!! I ended up with the blueberry pancakes which were just ok at best. 

Even though Danielle was AN AWESOME SERVER, I wouldn't come back here anymore. The quality of the place really went downhill since we last came.. which makes me sad because it used to be a great brunch spot."}
{"text":"Visited Toronto for the first time ever for Caribana weekend and my friends and I were on the hunt for food after hours of dancing and walking for the parade. My best friend and I separated from the pack and stumbled upon this gem. We decided to eat here because we refused to continue walking and we were HUNGRY!!! I must say we were HAPPY we did. The decor of the restaurant was, as the name states, old school, but very stylish. It was very clean and the staff was EXTREMELY friendly. I really wish I could remember the name of our waiter and the two bartenders, but if they remember the two girls from NYC and our group of friends who came in after us, just know we LOVED you guys (and they taught us the Canadian national anthem). 

Now onto the food. ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. My friend and I decided to share this platter of food that came with two half chickens, a full rack of ribs, two huge biscuits, a large side of baked beans, and two potatoes. This had to be the best meal we had during our entire trip to Toronto. Everything was cooked and seasoned to perfection!!! And their bbq sauce was off the hook!! The drinks were awesome and we just had an overall good time. Clearly we couldn't finish off all the food, but we surely devoured it hours later when we got back to our hotel. 

We were all contemplating about moving to Toronto because of this restaurant. I really wish I would've made this yelp posting around the time of our trip because I would've been able to remember everyone's names, but the entire staff was soooooo amazing. Trust and believe we will be back the next time we visit."}
{"text":"Very impressed with this restaurant, love the afterhours kitchen at this place. 2am and your downtown Toronto and hungry for a real traditional BBQ type of meal go to this place. Good value here quality food for what you pay. I had the nightowl meal everything was great."}
{"text":"The service and food quality has gone downhill  since it first opened. The wait staff are miserable, slow and hard to grab their attention.  Everything ordered, something was missing -  teaspoon to stir  tea/ coffee, ketchup for fries etc. Kitchen is slow, food came out cold, like it had been cooked hours ago ( mushroom toast). English Breakfast came without toast and when we asked for side of toast they said the toast would arrive well after time it took to eat breakfast.  Never going back."}
{"text":"A great place for brunch! I came with some girlfriends on a weekday around noon, so other than a large group seated next to us, it was quite empty. Service is excellent - very prompt to ask us if we wanted drinks and was always refilling water glasses. Although it did take a little while for our food to arrive, but not a problem. I ordered the mac and cheese which was AMAZING! It was so creamy and I couldn't even finish it all because the portions were quite generous.

The whole presentation of the food, as well as the cute interior decor, is what makes this place so popular."}
{"text":"Decided to try this last night around midnight.
They didn't have 'everything' we wanted however what we ordered was impeccable. Really impressed with the food and service. Def did not expect this from a 24/7 joint. We walked out utterly satisfied. No exaggeration, food and service was amazing !!!!! Portion sizes we're quiet large. We had the chicken and waffles, pulled pork put meat, Mac & cheese (amazing) & the cheese cake stuffed French toast. No complaints on anything."}
{"text":"This used to be good...higher prices than last year, smaller menu and very low grade food for top dollar 

I had the eggs Benedict- the potatoes were just cut in half and deep fried...they were hard and not seasoned....the eggs and peameal bacon were good but it was $16 for the meal. 


My gf had the chicken and Waffles for $17 it was a half of chicken breast on a big waffle...the chicken was okay but very small portion  and the waffle was soooo bad. It was dry and hard. Tasted like they made it in advance and just heated it up. You had to hack though to cut it. 

A couple across from us got the chicken and waffle dish and they were struggling to cut and eat it. 

I have been here more than 4 times and would not return. 

The bill with 2 coffees was $46.00 inc tax for a breakfast that was not acceptable.


The menu had the head chefs listed and I would be embarrassed to have my name on there because they couldn't cook potatoes or make a waffle."}
{"text":"Chicken and waffles were delicious, but service was incredibly slow given that it was not busy at all. Food is a bit over-priced, compared to other restaurants with similar options."}
{"text":"This was the first stop we made on a food-driven trip downtown with a friend visiting home for a week. There were four of us and because we still had a number of restaurants/food stalls/etc. we planned on hitting up during the day, we ordered only two breakfast meals.

We ordered the Hogtown BBQ Benny ($16) - \"soft poached eggs on cheddar chive biscuit + spicy hogtown hollandaise + low n' slow pulled pork + potato salad + greens\". The poached eggs weren't runny by the time we ate them. They were more on the soft-boiled side. This was quite possibly due to the fact that we had our waffles before we moved on to this dish. The cheddar chive biscuit was quite tasty. The hogtown hollandaise was tasty. It tasted like a slightly spicy smoked aioli (I have limited experience with what hollandaise is supposed to taste like). The pulled pork was not quite pulled. It was in fairly large chunks. That was slightly disappointing. It also wasn't juicy or saucy. The accompanying sides were alright, but nothing special.

However, Old School gets a 4 star from me because their brown sugar, bacon, and banana waffles ($14) were outstanding. I'm not one to order waffles (I have two waffle makers at home), but my friend wanted this, so we ordered it. According to the menu, it's \"golden waffles + butcher's crack + cinnamon crunch banana + brown sugar butter\". Now that I'm looking at the description, I feel like some of those items weren't what I ate, but what I ate was very impressive. This dish came with four fairly large waffle quarters. The waffle was the fluffiest I've ever eaten, and just based on the waffle and the accompanying butter, I would have been willing to order this again. Assuming that the butcher's crack is the bacon, it was pretty much just slightly candied bacon. Tasty, but not quite crack. There were also only two slices of it...for four waffle quarters. The cinnamon crunch banana was a deep fried banana cut in half. I did not taste the cinnamon at all. However, the banana was very tasty as well. The brown sugar butter was more like cinnamon butter, but it was delicious. I would come back just to eat the waffles.

Service was very friendly and they were kind enough to split our bill into four equal parts even though we only ordered two dishes.

Next time I'm in the area for breakfast, I wouldn't mind trying more of their waffle dishes."}
{"text":"The food is fine but we waited for our food for half an hour in a restaurant that was staffed by four people and had six patrons in it."}
{"text":"Hubby and I were looking for a place to eat near Bathurst and Dundas. Of course I did what I would always do and used trusted Yelp to find nearby restaurants. Old School was a short walk away (especially important in the stifling humidity) and we were able to walk there quickly and be seated right away. 

I was immediately impressed by the feel of the place. The music was great, and the black and white murals and banquettes and metal tiled ceilings give a fun but polished feel to the space. On this scorcher of a day, it took a while to cool down even while seated indoors (aka air conditioning was not very strong, and I'm not a person who likes it very cold!). But with the blinds pulled down, the area we were seated at cooled down.

I had wanted to try their lavender lemonade but they were out of the ingredients required to make it. Their fountain drinks are mixed in house and have a minimal number of ingredients compared with the store-bought sodas. The server mixed up a lemonade for me, which was deliciously refreshing. 

The menu consist of a lot of comfort foods like barbecue, sandwiches, salads, burgers, grilled cheese, and other brunch type items. I ordered the Mac and cheese cobbler (which our server Cam assured me was delicious and large enough to be a main despite being listed as one of their sides). Hubby ordered The Little Pig, which consists of brisket, slaw, potato salad.  OMG! The Mac and cheese was creamy, cheesy, noodles perfectly al dente -- like a warm hug (perhaps not the lightest food option for such a hot day). Sure enough, the portion was very shareable and I was only able to eat half of it before packing the rest to go.  It is that filling! Hubby's brisket was very flavourful & juicy, and served with potatoes and a green salad. 

Service was fantastic. Cam our server was attentive and funny.  I would definitely go back to try some of the crazy yummy sounding items from their \"Mama can't make this\" section of their menu, like the cheesecake stuffed egg bread rolled in toasted coconut, whipped cream and orange honey drizzle called Don't Even Go There! Yum! Definitely recommend! 3.75 stars."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for the first time today as we had heard good things about the place. After looking over the menu, I wanted to try the Bad Apple French Toast but was hesitant as it contained Brie, which I am not a big fan of. I asked, but it could not be served on the side as it is integral to the preparation of the meal. Thankfully the server convinced me to give it a chance anyway - it ended up being one of the best variations of the dish that I've ever had. As for the staff, I found the server very friendly, attentive and (obviously) knowledgable about the items on the menu."}
{"text":"Amazing brunch! Always plan to have a nap after you come here. My favorite is the Blueberry Hill pancakes just a stack of pancakes with bacon and blueberries. The mac and cheese is definitely top 10 Toronto mac&cheeses."}
{"text":"Great to find a 24/7 place in Toronto. It has a hip ambience to its environment with artistically decaled walls and seats; half diner half low key speakeasy. I decided to try the general chicken and waffles but other popular dishes include their Blueberry Hill and their French toast. Service is pleasant and welcoming."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO

just like a lot of people, we went because the food looked good. The food was anything but ordinary. Honestly you can get something better somewhere else. The service was absolute shit. 

We got to the restaurant at around 12:30, waiting by the entrance and for 15 minutes, no one greeted us, at all. And there was even someone working at the bar by the entrance! Even the waitress that was walking in the room didn't greet us, she even made eye contact with me. At this point was getting irritated but I thought \"it's okay maybe they're really busy\". Finally someone came and she took our names and said when a table is ready she'd call us. At first I thought, there are so many open tables, why can't you just seat us. And then she said they were under staffed, which I would've understood the slow business but honestly these girls were not even trying. So we waited outside and waited inside for like ONE HOUR. And this couple that recently came in say by the bar and was taken care of immediately. At this point I was just pissed. It was rude like come on. Finally we got seated and still the waitress wasn't very nice, we ordered our food as soon as possible so we could eat. I ordered the blueberry pancake and my boyfriend ordered chicken and waffles. We waited another 45 minutes for our food. They gave a donut to the people waiting so long as their way of saying \"sorry\" I guess but at this point idgaf about a donut, I want my food. The food came and wow, even that was a disappointment, the chicken and waffle??? The smallest piece of chicken and a large waffle, as for my blueberry pancake, it just wasn't worth the wait and the service. The milkshake was good but shake shack is way better and WAY cheaper with a larger amount (check that place out when you're in the states). As soon as we finished eating we called to pay. The lady that was working the bar came to our table as asked \"are you done\", not even politely, no smile or anything, just starts grabbing my plate and says \"are you done\". We paid and when we left we both looked at each other and said \"never again\" 

Side note: if you're an Asian (which we both are) I do not recommend this place. I can tell the services between different people and their culture are different. BUT I could be wrong, just a little warning just in case. 

Another side note: this was on a Sunday, Iuno if that means anything.

PLEASE eat somewhere else. for the wait time, service, price and food? You can go somewhere much much better."}
{"text":"Unprofessional servers, slow service, dirty cook, distasteful/burnt food. Will not be dining here ever again. It took them 30 minutes just to bring beer with only max 8 tables on a weekday! Mind you the bar was like 10 steps away with a bartender who was just chatting with a regular and not working. Preposterous."}
{"text":"Went here on a Monday afternoon so the place was quiet and didn't have to wait long for our orderes.  Had possibly the best pulled pork sandwich I've ever had. We also ordered the fried chicken and waffles which were also amazing. I'd definitely recommend trying Old School."}
{"text":"Loved this place! We arrived on a Saturday afternoon and were seated right away. 

The decor is very cute, and the Blueberry Hill Pancakes were AMAZING. I didn't even need to add syrup, they were perfect. The combination of the Butcher's Crack, pancake and blueberry compote were perfect together.

My friend had the breakfast poutine which was also amazing. 

We also tried the Caesar, Mimosa and Chocolate Shake.. all amazing.

I will definitely be back soon!

Thanks to our server Nate for all of the suggestions!"}
{"text":"Ive never written a review before but this place was SO BAD i had to save people from wasting their money here. I was walking down dundas on my way to saving grace when my friend said we should try a new place so we went in.

Im gonna start with service. HORRIFIC!! They have no clue what theyre doing here. They dont even know whats in the food! When i asked them if \"the standard\" had bacon in it? The waiter said no and told me to order a side of bacon then when the standard came THERE WAS BACON IN IT. I payed 5$ extra for a side of bacon for no reason!? 

When the order came the side biscuit was cold and disgusting. Even the eggs were cold. HOW CAN YOU MESS UP SOMETHING CALLED \"THE STANDARD?!?! The beans and the hashbrowns was decent but to be honest the coffee was pretty bad too. The mug was too big and too heavy.

My friend ordered the goat cheese omelet. There was not enough goat cheese in it. It was cold and the salad on the side didnt even have dressing on it. Ew. 

When we asked for the bill he brought the wrong bill for me TWICE.  And when i told him it was wrong the second time he gave me attitude like i was wrong. 
Ive been a server before and i cant believe that a new resturant that is trying to make a name for its self can be so TERRIBLE. 

My suggestions: 
- MAKE THE FOOD THE WAY ITS DESCRIBED ON THE MENU.
- HIRE BETTER SERVERS.
- ALWAYS RESPECT THE PAYING CUSTOMER. 

AND PLEASE HIRE A NEW INTERIOR DESIGNER!! Theres nothing even remotely \"old school\" about this place. Nothing was authetic and it lacked character. Zero personality.

Im gonna finish with saying that the food was so bad i felt gross the whole day. 

I would not recommend this place to anyone. Ever.

SAVE YOUR MONEY PPL."}
{"text":"Beautiful decor. Went on a Sunday evening was not busy I went with a large group. I ordered fried chicken which was average with coleslaw, a biscuit which was soft and flavourful and potato salad. I didn't enjoy the potato salad it was very tangy from the vinegar. I would definitely recommend trying the spicy honey sauce it goes with most dishes."}
{"text":"Who wouldn't love BBQ brunch/ Brisket with eggs? Yes Please! Hidden away in the west side of Dundas and Bathurst, is a small brunch spot that serves BBQ for brunch! The Brisket was delicious but the show stopper really was the pulled pork. Deliciously spiced and moist you really can't get out of their without trying any.

If I had one complaint, its the wait time. Due to the small size of the restaurant, my group and I ended up waiting almost 2 hours to be seated, granted that it was 12 pm on Sunday 2 hours was a long wait time but hey it is Toronto. The service was alright, the server was nice but due to  the busy restaurant we hardly ever saw her. The place a great ambiance very upscale casual with a good drink list for early morning drinks. They're Late night 12 am - 4 am menu sounds fantastic for those who want a late night snack!"}
{"text":"I was never raised to have brunch but sure I was raised to have western style breakfast. I happened to always wake up and to eat around brunch time at home, and I also love the combination of sweet and salty in my meal.

This is the first time I actually woke up on time to go out for brunch at an restaurant. I didn't give 5 stars because the wait for the line and for the food was way too long. Half an hour waited on the line and half an hour wait after we ordered the food.

I ordered a chocolate-strawberry malt milkshake, it was good, not amazing.
My favorite was the Chicken waffle and Blueberry buttermilk pancakes. The salt and the syrup fuses together.

We also ordered the omelet, not really a fan of omelet, to me its just eggs with some other ingredients stays inside a pan fry egg, instead of eggs with other ingredients which creates a new taste."}
{"text":"I went there for brunch today with my friends, I got \"the standard\" which was pretty good overall. The bacon and eggs were very good, the biscuit had a good flavor but was a bit overcooked and stiff on the outside. I give this place 5 stars because of the service. Two of us got there early so we had to wait for the other two friends. They didn't show up until 40 minutes later so we were just sitting there without ordering anything. I felt so bad for doing this but the waiter was very understanding and friendly. After the other two friends came we ordered our food. While we were eating the waiter constantly came back to check if everything was good. Overall it was a nice experience and I will definitely eat here again"}
{"text":"Don't Even Go There French Toast was BOMB! If you have a sweet tooth for desserts, this one is for you! I could have eaten two or three! My bf ordered chicken and waffles - he's had better. Overall, the decor was nice and retro (stolen neon artwork) and the service was great! I would definitely return for those french toast!"}
{"text":"Great brunch, service, and atmosphere!  
A little bit of a wait for Saturday brunch as to be expected but it went by quickly about 20 wait. 
Ordered the poached eggs and a latte they were fabulous! 
This is a really popular brunch spot so if your planning on dropping in on the weekend expect a bit of a wait!"}
{"text":"Great new joint! Love the space - very chic and non-grungy... It's very spacious (with it's lengthwise dining room, patio, and General Store in the back!) the wait staff is dressed well. 

Now, the important stuff: the food. We had the fried chicken, the smokey chicken and fish and chips. Portions were very generous and came with ample sides. There was also the option of \"upgrading\" the meal and adding another (generously sized) side for $5 (which we opted for the mac'n'cheese). The food was good, but could have used more flavor. I'm hoping that the food will only get better from here - they have the right idea with the menu (lots of great options) and add the fact that 80% of the menu is available around the clock, we shall await the slight improvements!

That said, the boozy milkshakes hit the spot! Great flavor and not lacking of booze...

As far as the service, the wait staff were friendly and attentive. The food did not take long to arrive, and the staff consistenly checked on our table if we needed anything throughout the evening. Our server in particular (named Julian) was very friendly, down to earth and knowledgable.

The only suggestion that I would like to give is perhaps when we were received the bill, that we could have been advised that payments are processed at the cashier (in the back portion, at the General Store counter). I would not have been an issue, but we got stuck behind a bigger group when we went to pay (while we had been sitting at our table assuming that a machine was available to round the tables).

Overall, I will visit here again, and have recommended it to friends. There's a lot of items on the menu that I can't wait to try!"}
{"text":"Came for brunch on a Sunday around 1pm...the hostess took our number and told us it would be an hour wait for a table for two. Nearly 90 minutes later, tummies audibly rumbling, we finally got called.

But it was worth the wait. A stack o' pancakes covered with blueberry compote and a dollop of whipped brown sugar butter, served with perfectly crisp \"butcher's crack\" (aka bacon) was lip-smackingly good. Definite hangover kryptonite.

Hubby had a half rack of ribs which were also fantastic, especially when dipped generously in their homemade BBQ sauce. The \"smoke stack\" fries, however, were nothing too memorable...I would try a more interesting side dish next time.

Bottom line, Old School is a good bet for great brunch."}
{"text":"New favourite brunch place. They take reservations and are open 24/7! I haven't had to wait very long even on a Saturday during brunch hours. Strongly recommend the chicken and waffles and the blueberry hill pancakes!"}
{"text":"Prior to coming here, I was excited to try out this place but was disappointed when I first walked in. There was a girl who was punching in orders as we walked in so I expected her to finish what she was doing before she greeted us but once she was done she continued to other tables. So basically no one greeted us at the door until magically some waiter came from the back to seat us. Bad first impression of this place!

The service here kind of bummed out my mood as they seem like they were not interested in working there. The food is what I was most disappointed in. I ordered the omelette which didn't even look like a traditional omelette and let alone the \"smoked sausage\" was pretty much burnt to its crisp. My boyfriend ordered the bbq hog town Benny? And it was pretty much gross - the egg whites of the soft poached egg where undercooked which made the meal slimy. Also the bread seem to be hard which made the meal even more unpleasant to eat. The greens that came out with both meals were terrible it was wilted/bruised - it seemed like they do not care about the quality of food they bring out the table. 

All in all I don't think I would come back here - maybe for the pancakes I want to try but even then I rather go somewhere pleasant where the service cares about the guest when they first arrive."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick brunch on my way out of town. I ordered the biscuits du jur and it didn't have any flavor. The biscuit was disappointing as it was described as a fluffy cheddar biscuit, but wasn't anything close. The egg was nicely poached, but the chicken on the meet was inedible as it was very tough and dry. Further, the side of fruit was not suitable to be served. The chunks of pineapple still had the rind on it which I had to cut off myself and multiple of the grapes still had pieces of their stems attached so each grape had looked at seperately before eating it. The only positive thing was the service, which was great. But food wise, this place was a total miss."}
{"text":"Really, I'd like to give a 4.5 star rating but 4 will have to do.

We came in around 4pm on Family Day.  So glad they weren't busy at all.  My friend and I had a friendly conversation with the hostess before seating us (which was right away).

My friend ordered the Latka Benny? and I ordered the blueberry hill pancakes with a side of their potatoes.  It really is a hill of pancakes!  Although, small in size you do get 5 pancakes which was very filling.  I only ate 3 and gave 2 to my friend.  The first bite of the pancakes made me dance in my seat.  That's how I know the food is good lol.  They had just the right amount of fluffiness and flavour.  I don't know what they season their potatoes with but my friend and I agreed that they were delicious!  There's some sort of after taste that makes them so yummy.  My only slight complaint were the mimosas.  They say they use fresh squeezed orange juice and it looked freshly squeezed, but maybe they weren't ripe at all??  The mimosa was really light in colour and it didn't seem fresh.  I swear it was all champagne and a splash of orange juice.  Anyways, not a big deal.  This is definitely a good brunch spot. All the servers are friendly too!"}
{"text":"Was looking for a place to go for a drink after dinner with my wife and friends. A round of drinks was $70. 2 glasses of wine and a 2 old fashions. Sounds like ransom. Don't think I'll be back.  This place better sharpen its pencil on what they (up)charge on drinks or they will never see most customers twice."}
{"text":"When we got to Old School, there was bit of a wait for a table. The hostess told me that there was only one chef (the other one had called in sick or something) on the line so food would take a 30-45 minutes once seated. As someone who works in the food industry, it's understandable--at least to me. 

Once we got seated, we got asked if we wanted coffee etc. Right off the bat, we all knew what we wanted so we ordered right away. There wasn't much to do besides talking and enjoying the views inside and outside. 

It took about 30-ish minutes for our food (though, I lost track of time so whatever lol). Everything was plated nicely, not sloppy at all. Our food tasted really well. 

I'll definitely come back when the patio is officially open!"}
{"text":"Man, was the foos here good! My friend and I had the fluffy pancakes and the American french toast. The food waa so delicious, the prices were decent and the service was great!

The atmosphere was trendy, I personally loved the fact that they are open 24 hrs. The washrooms were also spacious and clean

I would definitely reccommend this place and go back myself!! ^^"}
{"text":"I've been to Old School twice since it opened, both times for brunch, and I definitely had a better experience the second time around. I think this was mainly server dependent and because they have become more flexible on modifications to the menu.

As far as menus go this one doesn't have a whole lot of vegetarian options. It is a diner menu and very meat dominant with a lot of pulled pork and the like. The first time around I tried the souffle omelet with a mixed berry salad and the second time a modified eggs Benny that the chef did for me with arugula and caramelized onions. Both were fairly solid but not the most mind blowing I've ever had. Also the brunch potatoes were only ok.

Since my first visit they have conceded to get almond milk (after tons of requests I'm sure). Their unsweetened iced almond milk latte was very enjoyable. My friend got hers sweetened and it was way too much and she couldn't drink it. When they made it again they brought out the sweetener on the side, it was basically sugar syrup. Tip: do this and add your own coz I guarantee you only need a quarter of it.

I like that they take reservations for brunch because it eases my reluctance to drag people over that way without a guaranteed seat. Especially because the queue inducing Patois is a few doors down and there is bound to be spill over for people who can't get in there.

I'd be interested to see what this place is like later at night (since it is 24 hours). It's a lot classier looking than its Lakeview counterpart and hopefully lacks the line and bouncer with God complex. Seems like a nice late night option in comparison and has more of a vibe than the Thompson Diner. I'd happily go back for brunch but I'm not ride or die."}
{"text":"I love breakfast palaces and old school diners so when I walked past this place and saw the sign I knew I had found the right place.  Everything on their breakfast menu, which is served until 4pm looked great.  I went for the Scramble of the day, with red peppers and jack cheese and it was one of the best scrambled eggs I have had .   Their breakfast potatoes are equally good and the cheese biscuits won me over as I don't usually eat biscuits.  I also ordered a side of their \"Butcher's Crack.\"   Don't come in here without having some. And the coffee was really good too. 

This is my new favourite breakfast place in Toronto and one of the Too 5 I've ever been to .

Update:  can I add a star?  The new brunch menu is crazy good.  I had the French Toast with bacon and Brie.  :)))"}
{"text":"Forget what my dish was called but it was good. Had a bite of my friend's banana waffles too and they were yummy! Try their spiced honey, it's good on everything"}
{"text":"After trying this place from having gone to School in Liberty Village, it stuck me as nothing special. I like the fact that its 24hrs, definitely would be an option for coming here at 3am. We had the All american toast and Chicken and Waffles. My niece loved the toast, however my chicken was a little on the cold side, and slimy(fat?), perhaps bad batch? I also only received a piece of chicken, judging by the other pictures and reviews, they forgot half my order especially at $19 a plate, I'd expect a little more. (see photo) Anyway, service was decent, servers came up and checked up on us and refilled my coffee, I'd come back if it was convenient but not if it was out of my way. Overall a trendy clean brunch/ spot with a slight confusing menu to read worth."}
{"text":"My boyfriend  and I were in desperate need of a good brunch spot before we spent the rest of the day sight-seeing. When walking in we first noticed a bar the right and the bartender giving a friendly greeting and letting us know the hostess would be right with us. Giving us time to take in the decor we noticed the fun and trendy dinner like feel to the resteraunt that hinted toward it's \"Old School\" name. 
We decided to sit outside on the patio because of the nice weather. I Decided on coffee and my boyfriend the lavender lemonade.We both enjoyed our meals throughtly and with our check also received advice on local places to check out from the waitress. 
I would definitely come back here again expecially to try the blueberry pancakes. Overall I thought it was a nice place to have brunch with decent service and a fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Orgasmically delicious pulled pork eggs benny & great friendly sevice. What more can a gal ask for at brunch?"}
{"text":"Always good food and good times at Old School. Their place is perfect for catching up with friends and munching on yummy food like these blueberry pancakes! Not overly sweet, just right and the portion is perfect for one person. As this is a popular place with lineups every time I go, it can be a little hard to flag down a waiter and the wait time for food can be a bit long. So if you're thinking of grabbing a quick bite in a quiet place, this is not it! It's better for social settings!"}
{"text":"I am going to write this review as honestly as I possibly can.

I've been here twice with friends already and both times the food has been great. Good presentation, tasty food, big portion sizes. However both times the service has been a bit abysmal. I don't know if this is a common trend, but we waited literally 45 minutes for pancakes to come out for our table of 2 and the time I went today the food took over an hour to come out ! At the 50 minute mark I flagged down the waitress and said we might just leave because it's been too long and the manager told us it's on the house and then the food came out 10 minutes after, albeit a bit cold.

It's almost disappointing that such a good place, with such good presentation and food has to be ruined by terribly slow service. The waitress was super kind both times."}
{"text":"Great bar. Great music and great ambiance. Best bartender (Jonathan). We ordered the gent, the mojito, and the orchard pooch. All of which were absolutely delicious. Let's go! #Nyc2Toronto"}
{"text":"Great brunch spot. Came here on a sunday morning and was pleasantly surprised it wasn't too busy. I had the the standard - two eggs, bacon, home fries, baked beans, fruit cup and a biscuit. I didn't even touch the fruit and biscuit, what a pile of food! Very reasonable prices. The eggs were cooked well and the beans and home fries were tasty. They had loose leaf tea too which is always nice. Service was fine, a little slow. Decor and music is fun. One complaint would be the food came out luke warm. At the back they have delicious looking baked goods. Would return again."}
{"text":"We waited over an hour but it was worth it. Our waiter was very knowledge and our food was incredible. We had fried Chicken and waffles and the Bacon Cheddar burger. I am a Burgas fan and I've got admit this was a dreamy burger. It was so flavourful and it was such a big portion. Also the atmosphere of the restaurant is very cute. The wait staff was very professional. I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Really impressed with this place!! Went for Sunday brunch around noon and was told it'd be a 40 minute wait, but then the hostess called up 15 minutes later saying they could seat us. It sucks that they don't take resos but I love that they at least call when your table is ready instead of just forcing you to awkwardly stand around outside like some other brunch spots in the area *ahem* Saving Grace *ahem*.

There's a really good selection of drinks (hot and cold coffees and teas, milkshakes, fresh juices.. egg creams!!) and balance between sweet and savory eats as well. The buttermilk pancakes were so good -- the brown sugar butter was the perfect topping in that it wasn't disgustingly sweet. Really all the dishes I saw going by looked incredible. 

Also, service was incredible. I'm so used to the BS you get at a lot of hipster places that make you feel as if being there and dining there is kind of a burden to them... I did not get this feeling AT ALL at Old School. The hostess was friendly, our server was attentive and helpful with suggestions and menu questions. I'm so excited for their patio to open, I def would come back!"}
{"text":"Ordered the ribs n brisket and was disappointed. Both were tough and chewy. Not very flavorful."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food!! To be fair when I went I was starving. I am a person who really likes a good simple breakfast. It's my favorite meal, usually involves something salty and sweet...you can't go wrong but so many do... BUT not here... This meal was perfection. I ordered waffles and chicken with a sriracha infused honey. The entire time I was thinking...I just want maple syrup...just bring me basic. WHOA! Let me tell you...my mouth is watering thinking about that tender yet crispy chicken, the waffles was PERFECT...not too soft, not too crunchy, thick, fluffy but dense. If they were in NYC you would never get a seat....and that sriracha infused honey was everything...and I hate hot sauce. These folks know how to do it well. Love the decor too! Too busy eating to take pictures. YUM!"}
{"text":"5 Stars because of the chicken and waffles. I don't think I can say it enough. Vibe of the place felt like Mumford n sons should have been playing, instead I was hearing Rick Ross, 2 chainz, etc. Again though, the chicken and waffles!"}
{"text":"I ordered the hogtown bbq benny with avocado and classic fluffy pancakes. Loved the spicy hogtown hollaindaise sauce but the cheddar chive biscuit was not very fresh. The pancakes were delicious as well. The place was packed with few staff, due to which the table next to us wasn't cleaned for a while and had flies around which was quite disappointing."}
{"text":"On my mini layover in Toronto, I was able to see an old friend on Spring holiday. She recommended that we grabbed brunch here at Old School because the pancakes looked AMAZING in photos.

Well, we had to try it for ourselves, and we were satisfied!

Showing up on a Thursday afternoon, you would expect it to be fairly empty-ish. When we arrived, it was nearly packed, with only a few tables left for us. We started off with a Caesar and mimosa, which surprisingly came out a lot later than we expected. Drinks were okay overall, but we were turned off by how long it took for us to get them. We looked towards the bar multiple times, and swore the bartender was just chatting with patrons. Wish there was another shot of champagne in my orange to make up for lost time I could've gotten buzzed quicker.

As for the food, I ordered a basic breakfast plate with Canadian bacon, beans, potatoes, two eggs, and a garlic muffin. The bread was probably my favorite item on the plate! When hot and steamy, it was nearly perfection. My scrambled eggs were also very nice, but everything on the plate felt mediocre for the price that we were paying. For my friend, her pancakes looked and tasted great, and was probably the better option of the two.

I thought that Old School did a decent job at giving us a brunch experience. If they can tune up the service a bit and eliminate the wait time just a tad (especially for drinks), then this can turn into a really good spot for Toronto natives and visitors alike."}
{"text":"Late night, after bar, chill, munchies place. Definitely big enough portions (calories) to share. Went super fat kid and Tried the 'crunch' sandwich with a side poutine   
Service was great, super friendly. Will definitely be going back again :)"}
{"text":"The chicken and waffles were pretty good, definately need to go during the day if you want to take pictures. Night time just doesnt work for something like this. And I came here during dinner, it felt weird to be eating pancakes at 8PM. Work a try though"}
{"text":"Sometimes finding a place to eat when you're hungry is difficult; you can make the worst decision sometimes in the name of hunger, fortunately, this was not the case.

Old School labels itself an old-school diner. I dunno if I agree with that per say, but it is still cool inside. It's more hip than old school diner to me, but truthfully, I'm here for the food- not the style.

I sat at the bar for brunch. The bartender/waiter was great. We chatted about Toronto and he gave me tips about the city and things to do. Was great. 

I ordered the blueberry hill and an orange juice. The OJ was not good. Too sour for me and not that cold. The pancakes made up for it. A stack of pancakes (about 5) and In the second pancake is a huge layer of bacon. Tons of blueberries on top of the pile. Every bite was delicious. The pancakes were the perfect amount of thickness and the blueberries were the right amount of sweet. Totally satisfying.

One thing to note: the bathrooms were utterly disgusting. I was there around 11am and they a mess. So bad that I ended up not even using them. So you might have to hold it in if you eat here, but the food is pretty worth it, even if it may cause you a UTI because you had to hold it in."}
{"text":"Attentive servers, lively music and overall  great service. Lavender lemonade was delicious but sadly, the 3 dishes we ordered were awful. The blueberry pancakes were underwhelming and thin. The \"bad apple french toast\" was very soggy and inedible. Lastly, the mac and cheese was probably the worst of all - watery and the macaroni was overcooked. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"The service was really good, and the staff was nice and polite. Their pancakes are just as they are featured and tasty indeed, especially for those who have a sweet tooth. The interior is super cool, even better if you come at night, because of the general dark impression. The place definitely deserves to be put on a favorite list!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times on random evenings for drinks. They have a good patio, and the kitchen opens til late for what looks like some decent food.

Overall, the service has been more miss than hit, but friendly. I came back yesterday (Sunday) for brunch as the food looked good in times past. This is a case where looks can be insanely deceiving. I ordered the omlette, which is supposed to be stuffed with goat cheese, potato, and sausauge. You can refer to the picture to see it was far from the menu description and my subsequent expectations. The omlette came with cheesy biscuit which was mealy and under-cooked, and greens, 1/3 of which were wilted, slimy, and rotten. 

This was ok for the most part since I've been trying to curb my excessive eating and the food at Old School definitely served me well as an appetite suppressant."}
{"text":"Food menu is good but if you go with kids be prepared to wait over 2hrs---we got in at 1030 and got served at 12:16pm?

Not cool when you make reservations for your group and to experience such delays as other got there food and left...."}
{"text":"The food at this place was fine, but the service was so so awful. In the plus column: open 24 hours, lots of seating (inside and out), and fun menu. I had the Eggs Benedict and it was pretty good -- but harder to eat than normal because they use biscuits instead of English muffins and they are very hearty biscuits. The flapjacks were pretty good. Coffee took an eternity to arrive. Was challenging to get a cup of water. We couldn't find our waitress and had to ask multiple people to help us find her (she went to get us some coffee and didn't come back for more than 20 minutes). We asked to see the manager and he acted like we did something wrong. In fact, I felt like I had done something wrong. Was I not supposed to order decaf coffee? All this being said, I might try this place again because it is open all the time and other wait staff looked more helpful. Having been a waitress myself, it is rare that I complain about service. I might mention that a kitchen is slow or something but mostly to help prepare people for the wait but this was pretty durn bad."}
{"text":"I'm giving it 3 stars because of the wait between ordering and receiving our food. They did apologize for the wait but only after we asked how much longer it'll be. 
When we finally did receive our food, it was delicious. I would go back because there's so much more I want to try on the menu!"}
{"text":"Food and service was just ok. Im giving it a one because I was really disappointed with the service. A friend of mine ordered ribs and the server told him they didnt have it only to find out half an hour later that they still have it and getting served at the other table. When confronted, he said we would need to wait for a while which he should have explained to us earlier. We could have waited. That's very bad service right there. Boooo! First and last!"}
{"text":"Oh lord. This is a great example how a good restaurant will go down the gutter if it does not have it's act together.

I have been to Old School at least 5 times in the past few months and it  has been an absolute joy. Sure, their food may be a tad too heavy for my stomach, but that's part of the charm: hearty, big meals that will make you not wanna eat anything for the rest of the day. I have had quite a few of the various options: my favourite is \"Don't even go there.\" Extravagant, unnecessary and fantastic. 

And then came new management. Or so it seems. At least all of the staff has changed. Suddenly I did not recognise anyone. Which, in of itself, is not an issue - I could not care less in theory. In practice, what ended up happening was that there was some major logistal nightmares going on in the back (i.e. kitchen) where we waited, and I kid you not, 1 hour and 45 minutes to get our food. Now, generally, you'd say service sucks then. indeed it does. However, I must give koodos where koodos are to be given - we had a brilliant server (Danielle) who tried to bribe us with doughnuts and biscuits while we waited. She was an absolute joy, but even she could only bump this to a 2-star review. 

This whole situation is rather unfortunate, as this place used to be really good. Management needs to get its act together and get this fixed, because places in Toronto do not stay open for very long if you are treating your customers to this sort of fun. The Yelp reviews have dropped from 4.0 to 2.5 from July to August... May that be a good hint to changes that need to happen."}
{"text":"*the restaurant was spotless despite being open for 24 hours! 

*the way they divide the menu is really confusing...some items are only available at certain times or day. 

*The service was not really good as our server was almost nowhere to be found during the service. 

*Also, when we asked for the bill, no one told us that we had to pay at the General Store which was at the back of the restaurant, I'm not sure why they don't offer those wireless payment machines? 

*Overall our dishes were good but not spectacular, and they were both expensive for such small portion, which interestingly was also the same problem we had at School. However the selection of dishes at School were more unique, so if I have to choose between two restaurants, I would choose their sister's restaurant.

-Road-Crosser Chicken - General Fried Chicken, Potato Salad, Tabasco-Honey, Vanilla Butter, Coleslaw and Biscuit - $18: 
My friend received two pieces of fried chicken and some sides. The scone was dry and cold, coleslaw was drench in dressings and the potato was just your average salad. However the fried chicken was still juicy, did not have too much batter and seasoned just right. The honey tabasco sauce was really good as well and added just a right amount of heat with some sweetness to balance the flavor out.

-Crispy Finger Dinner - Battered chicken fingers, Smoke Stack Fries, Tartar and Lemon - $18: 
By the time I wrote this review, this dish is no longer being offered on Old School's menu..... I tried checking the website but I can't seem to find it :(.

For $18 I received 4 pieces of chicken fingers and half basket of fries....The chicken pieces were fried to perfection and had good seasoning, but I think the star of the dish had to be the tartar! The sauce was creamy and had a lot of dill, which added some nice refreshing zing to the chicken. The fries came out piping hot, and I must mention both of our dishes were not greasy at all."}
{"text":"This is a place I really wanted to give the benefit of the doubt, so I tried three times and the experience is still sloppy. Some food was great, other elements were cold, eggs were raw in some parts and service was slow for no reason. We won't be going back for another visit. Too bad!."}
{"text":"listen boys

u walk in u sit down.  the neon sign on the wall matches the atmosphere but it says the fricking dumbest thing ive ever seen.  really dumb 1/10 hated it

the theme is like, diner, luxe, graphic, clinical its alright.  my waitress was not in it for the win today she was buckwild in the brain had no idea what was up with her but i didnt mind it.  i had an omelette that came with a biscuit and leafs.  leafs were chunky i even had a whole leaf like the entire thing not even cut in half it was a butter lettuce so i likes the taste.  my omelette was so good spitcy sausage lil teenties potate and feta cheese in there it was a very tasty omelette and biscuit

something you should know is theres unlimited free pink sauce 

our waitress gave us the tiniest cups.  they were like cups for people who are the size of big fat racoon.  

i had a very special moment in the restaurant today.  a cool 80s sitcom song came on.  the sunshine blasted thru the windows and tickled the hairs of my friends. u could hear all the hustle bustle of the restaurant.  a very sexy waiter looked at me and smiled a bit.  i said a funny joke and all my friends were laughing.  the music fit in perfectly it was LITERALLY a baywatch montage.  

in conclusion: hot waiter, pink sauce so good, tiny cups, weird waitress, 80s sitcom, omelette good

\"Tiny cups.  Big sauce.\" - @nicolerichardson"}
{"text":"I love brunch spots so was very excited to try out Old School, which I have heard glowing reviews about.

The restaurant is very chic, and in the summer they have many of their doors and windows open so it has a very patio-esque feeling even without being on a patio. The food came in good portions, however I feel that their ratios are kind of off. I ordered the chicken and waffles, and the chicken to waffle ratio was probably 1:5, which I found very odd. Still tasty though. My friend ordered the pancakes, which were delicious, but there was very little blueberry sauce in comparison to the stack of pancakes she got. We also ordered mimosas, which were not at all worth their price - $9 for probably 1/2 cup of OJ and bubbly.

To be honest the food was good, and is worth me returning in the future, but the high prices and inattentive service costs them a star. We had a table of four, but were treated like a party of 20 or something. The server took 30 minutes to take our order, mostly because she didn't write them down and had to keep coming back to ask what we had ordered. The food then took another 45 minutes. The sad mimosas took 30 minutes to come out (and they weren't even worth the wait), then it took us a solid hour to get our bills and pay with the machine. Had reservations for 10am, got out after 2pm. It was a fun time, but I really hope they can amp up their service in the near future."}
{"text":"**Check this place out! (But beware the slow service :)**

Old School made me giddy when I found out it was right across the street from where we were staying. We arrive just after 9:15am for breakfast and was immediately loving the vibe. The upscale funky design and old school charm really has us grinning and expecting amazing coffee and ridiculously good food. 

Unfortunately, once we sat down, everything went down hill. Our poor server, who was a jewel, was the only front-house staff member on that morning. Apparently the other support staff hadn't shown up. Great, right?! Didn't help that the place filled up just as we got there meaning lots of coffee orders and running around for the poor girl. 

Needless to say, the service was super slow. And while we completely understood and our server explained the situation, we were a bit peeved that non of the other staff members (primarily cooks and kitchen staff) had jumped in to help out. Seriously, it ain't that hard to pour a coffee!

When we finally ordered we were given many options and \"my faves\" but for some reason the world-famous biscuits weren't ready yet meaning a few of our dishes came without. They DID show up later though piping hot! Yum. 

Overall - the food was pretty good - eggs, bacon, fresh fruit was had! - and while the service definitely put a bad taste in our mounts we think this place could have easily been a 4 or even a 5 star had everything worked out. I'd give it another try someday."}
{"text":"Really cute place on Dundas, has a lot of Insta opportunities, pretty good drinks, and some tasty menu options. 

The fun options like the breakfast poutine, pancakes, and chicken and waffles all looked amazing and pancakes tasted great! 

My boyfriend ordered the classic breakfast option and the eggs were a bit runny and everything was kind of cold and bland. 

Overall: OK if you go for a Saturday morning here or there."}
{"text":"went for brunch.  everything was bad.  I had the latka benny w/trout - fish was soggy and flavourless, the hollandaise had a gray hue and also flavourless, eggs were not just soft cooked but borderline raw, latka tasted like mold. took 20 minutes to get coffee.  Servers never seemed to know where food was going.  I'm actually shocked at how bad it was - it's very rare to get such a bad meal in Toronto"}
{"text":"Service at this place is friendly but very slow (a table behind us were trying to get the waitress' attention for so long that they dined and dashed). 

The food here is what you'd expect from a diner/greasy spoon rather than a nice brunch place. The food didn't really stand out nor was it very interesting - just very basic. There were a bunch of ingredients on the plate but didn't really work together. The cobb salad I got was also very wet, which was unsettling. Likely wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"I've been here twice recently and loved each visit. Their soundtrack is old school hip-hop, soul, funk, and R&B, so that's rad. The service is top-notch and the food is fresh and tasty. I love the vibe and the fact that it's open 24 hours. The only downside are the yellowjackets on the beautiful sidestreet patio. They have traps for them, but the beasts were still an issue. My food has always been tasty and satisfying. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Food is mediocre, service is terrible.

Came here on a Saturday at 11:45am, no wait, which was nice but they wanted us to wait outside until our full party of 3 was there (despite half the restaurant being empty). They have an \"upstairs\" and there were only four other people who were sitting up there at the time. Took a couple pictures, only to be told you need a permit (...what?) but you do not need one during the week. The reason is they're busy AF, people are in our pictures (...what people?), but there's a sign that says 10% off if you post on Instagram. Ok.

Will never come back, this place is garbage. If you like overly-sweet french toast, go for it. Eggs benedict were average."}
{"text":"Have been wanting to try this place for ages, SO glad we finally got there and will definitely be adding it to our brunch list.

Was about a 30 minute wait so make sure you get there before you're starving and put your name down.

Food was very very good! I had the blueberry pancake stack. Fluffy and delicious. Bacon was crispy and blueberries were fresh. I am usually not a fan of ordering sweet breakfasts but this was amazing! 

Friends had the waffles and fried chicken which I also tasted and that was equally as good. Chicken wasnt too fatty and crumbs were just right. 

Others had the banana pancakes and the pulled pork benny and both also looks fantastic.

Staff were friendly and service was fast.

A must visit!"}
{"text":"Not a very good place. FOH staff looks like they don't want to work there. Took about 20 until the server realized we were sat, if it wasn't for my girlfriend I would've gotten up and left a long time ago. Our food took almost 30 minutes to arrive on our table, not impressed. Food is alright, nothing too special, just like any other brunch restaurant. And the prices are a little on the pricey side for the portion you are served. 

After finishing my meal I took a look at the kitchen and I was quite impress with the amount of people they have back there, only 4 or 5. Although the kitchen is quite small they do pump food out a decent speed. The FOH and BOH just needs better communication on sending out all the food out at the same time and know when you pick up their food to keep wait times to a minimum. 

Although my experience this time wasn't very pleasant, I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and give them one more try before I ban this place from my brunch places to eat in Toronto."}
{"text":"Blue berry pancakes was quite tasty. Also had fried chicken and waffles. Chicken was a bit dry, the jalapeño honey didn't save it but does have a nice kick. Table wait time was also very long."}
{"text":"Old School is literally the worst restaurant on the west side. I am SO triggered by the sign every time I walk by. I went there for a casual brunch with my friends and we ended up waiting 2 hours for food that I could make at home. The food quality was so bad and the servers were too hipster. i honestly had a nervous breakdown after brunch because I paid $30 for a salad that was garbage. I am still so mad that I wasted my time at Old School."}
{"text":"I went two weekends ago with girlfriends and the wait was 20 mins at 11 am. But then it took 1 hour and 15 mins to get out food. They had warned us it would take 1 hour once seating us. 

I don't think the coffee is worth $3 but it is free refills and they have cream and milk. Also seems like a ploy to almost force you to get coffee while you wait so long for your food. 

The new waitress did being out a delicious banana chocolate crumble muffing to tide us over. 

My chicken and waffle was good! Not great but good. The waffle was crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. The single piece of crispy fried chicken was tasty with a mild spice that went well
With the syrup. 

I sampled the poutine and it was decent but I'm not a huge poutine fan to begin with. Not sure I would go back between the hours of 10:30-1 pm. The people who got their before 11  am were still waiting for their food!

Something needs to change. The $25 brunch + tax and tip isn't worth the wait unless you're purposefully fasting until noon. Ha."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday morning after a long night. The service was kind of lack-luster, slow seating, slow food arrival, took a while for our order to get taken. Which is a real shame, because the chicken and waffles was amazing, the breakfast poutine blew me away, and my friend had nothing but compliments about his eggs benny. Pretty cool cocktail list too, I was happy with my Aperol Spritz and I got a thumbs up about the Caesar. All around it was a pretty good brunch other than the service, which should be top-notch with a $100 price tag for two."}
{"text":"Came with my ex roomie (we shared his house 50 meters away for a year) for brunch because the other restros around were closed on labor day. 

The food was a waste of time if you need to travel more than 10 minutes (but if you live near trinity bellwoods you have much better options normally). And by naming the place old school they really mean it. Old school in a bad way with bland coffee, food loaded with grease and just pure, pure mediocrity and bore. 

My friend corroborated my opnion by being the bitchy one (usually thats my role but he was pissed by the food), it took them a long time to get his coffee, and his potatoes were so undercooked and they didnt believe him at first... And best of all, his tiny (seriously, size of a cortado) drip coffee in the end was 5 dollars. Ive never ever seen a coffee like that being priced more, ever.

Epic fail. I did not give 1 star because the waitress was nice enough."}
{"text":"Came in for Brunch with a close friend.

Under recommendation from our waiter, I had the general chicken and waffle while my friend had blueberry hill.

General chicken and waffle: when you are served the heat of the chicken  adds to the crunch and taste; however as soon as it starts to cool down (or after chewing for a while) you get this after taste which is very starchy. By the time I was done with the chicken I didn't want to eat the skin and the remaining breast meat I just swallowed quickly and drowned it with water. The waffle on the other hand was yummy. When eating the 2 side by side I aimed for the waffle coz it tasted better. Would not recommend it unless done right.

Blueberry Hill: was totally delicious. Me and my friend exchanged half our meals. Her pancakes were Soo good and yummy! Would definitely recommend it.

Service wise, it can definitely get busy and as expected service can be slow.

What's good about the place is that it is 24/7. Flapjacks at 2am?  Sure!  Plus I feel their pancakes are their strongest dish. Will come back for those!"}
{"text":"1 star penalty for serving Lukewarm Lakta Benny and cappuccino. 

We got here on a Saturday around 11:30am, only waited for 10 mins to be seated, off to a good start.  

Our waiter greeted us right away and bought us water. He swiftly took down our orders and bought us our cappuccinos 10 mins later. I loved the aroma and the taste of my cappuccino but not the lukewarm temperature.  

We ordered the Standard breakfast $12, blueberry hill pancakes $12 and the Lakta Benny $16.  The pancakes were the best dish out of the 3. It was Super moist and very tasty with the brown sugar butter.  The Lakta Benny was served with smoked trout and side salad. It was very different and I would have given 2 thumbs up except again, the latkas and eggs was lukewarm.  

I thought the price was very reasonable, great service and nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went to Old School for brunch with several people. They take reservations which is the best and quite rare. Our table was ready for us when we got there. Our server was pretty much gorgeous.

The food was great. I believe everyone enjoyed what they ordered. I had the Scramble Delight Du Jour which was quite tasty. There are minimal vegetarian options, but the ones on the menu seemed good and the scramble was veg that day so perhaps I got lucky. Most everything else has pork, and I think a lot of people like pork, so you'll like it here if you like pork.

They really value their local customers so if you live in the neighbourhood, let them know."}
{"text":"Cute little restaurant. I am pretty biased as I have only tried their chicken and waffles and it's delicious! Very tender and flavourful. I would avoid weekends during brunch time as it gets quite busy. Otherwise it's great."}
{"text":"Redeemed by Macaroni & Cheese!

Old School: you almost got 2 stars from me but your Mac&Cheese and bartender earned you an extra star... If the service and BBQ had been better that would be 4 or 5 stars!

We got there on a beautiful Saturday night and the patio was packed so we decided to grab a table inside since hubby planned to order a bunch of different sides and we could use the extra table space.

We were seated right away but it took at least 10 minutes to have a waiter take our drink order and then another 10 minutes for those drinks to arrive.

Finally we could place our order.

I ordered the Blueberry Hill which is as good as everyone says and the bacon aka Butcher's Crack was tasty but not addictive enough for crack status.  Some of the pancakes were a bit thick and dense while others were a bit thinner and crispier which were perfect. The blueberry sauce was sublime.

I also ordered a side order of the Apple wood smoked sausage which didn't arrive with the pancakes in fact it didn't arrive at all.

Hubby ordered the mini McCoy and found the chive biscuit to be his favourite part of the combo.  The brisket was cut too thick and while it had a fair bit of fat, it was oddly tough.  The ribs were smokey but very dry as if smoked to a crisp.  The pulled pork tasted to him like it had turned but the waiter assured him it is the Carolina style vinegar sauce they put on the pulled pork after shredding the meat... to hubby it tasted sour as in bad and so he brought it home to the dogs who were glad to eat it.

He also ordered the Mac&Cheese which arrived 20 minutes after the combo... we had not seen our waiter, actually any waiter, in all that time, and at one point I saw him try and deliver our Mac&Cheese to another table and then carry it back to the kitchen... so when he finally showed up with the Mac&Cheese we asked where was the sausage I ordered and the beans hubby ordered.  The young (and possibly new?) waiter freaked out and realized he forgot to order it and so another 10-15 minutes after that - and all the original food was cold - the last 2 sides arrived.

The beans tasted better than they looked and the sausage was peppery to the point of almost tasting like smoked pepperoni but it was juicy and the skin was crispy so it was a win.

The dish that redeemed Old School for hubby was the long awaited Mac&Cheese.  It was an OMG moment for him... from the biscuit crumble topping to the al dente pasta, to the rich and creamy cheese sauce that was NOT oily, to the layer of crispy chewy cheese browned on top - hubby could not think of a Mac&Cheese he had ever had that was better.  It actually went perfectly with the sausage when it finally arrived!

In the long wait for the Mac&Cheese hubby wanted another beer, and since our waiter was MIA, he walked up to the cool \"old school\" bar and asked the bartender for one and the bartender promptly brought it to the table.  Best service of the night was from the bartender!

After we finally had all our food, we thought our waiter left and another waiter had taken over so we asked him for more water and he brought a carafe full, something that would have been nice to have received earlier in the meal.

But it seems he was not our new waiter, so we asked if he could find our waiter as we wanted to get our leftovers packed up and get our bill.

Flustered waiter returns and takes all our food away and brings a bag with 2 take out containers inside along with our bill.  We ask for future if the Mac&Cheese is available for take out and he says the entire menu is and available for delivery through Foodora.

He is a sweet guy, and obviously new so we still tip him 15 percent and he absent mindedly walks away with our bag of leftovers we manage to grab it back before he gets too far!

On the way out we give a cash tip to the bartender because he actually deserved a tip for his excellent service, and he was gracious and appreciative.

We get home and open containers to give the dogs their pulled pork treat and discover that the 3 pancakes I had saved to take home were not in there but thankfully the Mac&Cheese was... I was not too upset missing my leftovers but hubby would have lost it if he didn't get his leftover Mac&Cheese.

Next time we are getting the Mac&Cheese and sausage as take out!  Maybe then Old School will earn another star or two!"}
{"text":"Got their General chicken & waffles, macaroni and cheese, bacon, and iced latte. The chicken & waffles comes with vanilla butter and it is AMAZING. Chicken crispy and tasty, waffles crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. It's pricey, so I rarely buy it. Macaroni and cheese is okay. Bacon is good but pricey. The iced latte is very tasty (not entirely sure if it's still offered). It's a good price and they give quite a lot. I love it.
The scenery indoors is very nice. Especially good for photos. 
Service is friendly. Was kind of hard to get the waiters/waitresses attention when I needed them. They were not at all judgmental when my friend and I asked for a specific seat and had a little photoshoot indoors."}
{"text":"I went to Old School on a Saturday night out with friends on their recommendation. 

I really like the vibe of old school, it's such a nice spot and I love their horse shoe shaped bar right at the front. It has an old school diner feel, but a bit elevated. 

Their drink menu has a few classic cocktails and an ok wine selection, if you are able to read it!!! I felt like an old lady as a struggled to read the tiny font. Why?? Just..why?!!! The food menu is small but lots looked delicious. I ultimately ended up with the matzoh breaded chicken fingers, and my friend had the fish and chips basket. Both were really good and their fries are perfectly seasoned - yum!! 

However, I felt like the service was super sub par. No one ever came to top up my tiny water glass until I got desperate and hunted a server down. They kind of rushed us out too - not like they had a line or anything, but there was definitely a \"is there anything else I can get you or just the bill\" vibe. 

Another weird thing (which doesn't count against them at all, just an observation!) is that looking around, my friend and I realized we were the only women in the front section of the restaurant. Everything else was big groups of 4+ men. Weird!

So in summary, my chicken fingers were amazing but the service, meh. If you're looking for this kind of casual place it's still worth checking out, just don't expect a refill on your water! :)"}
{"text":"This is my first review ever, I downloaded this app just so I could warn people to NEVER order breakfast from here!!! I was feeling very under the weather this morning and didn't want to make breakfast so I decided to order UberEATS despite my boyfriend telling me that we've never had good breakfast from UberEATS which is true but I always eat it anyways. This time was just absolutely revolting.  I got the standard breakfast which came with bacon, sunny side up eggs, beans, chive biscuit and home fries. Everything was just thrown in the box including the fruit, the beans would have been too if I didn't ask for them separately, warm fruit covered in egg is not a good time and everything besides the fruit was cold. I normally like my eggs over easy or sunny side up, a little undercooked is totally cool I'm really not that picky when it comes to food, but these eggs were barely even cooked, I took one bite and almost spit it back up, they were slimy and disgusting. I was especially excited for the bacon, because I mean it's bacon. I got two tiny undercooked fatty pieces of normal bacon, don't know if they know what candied bacon is but that's definitely not what it was, finally (for my breakfast)  I order an ice coffee, they didn't have any options to put anything like milk or sugar or what not so it's just a black ice coffee, which I don't drink and I have nothing in my house to put in it. My entire breakfast was thrown out. My boyfriend got the scramble du jour, which said it was scrambled eggs, chive biscuit, home fries and fruit. Same thing, it was all just thrown in the box, warm fruit, but everything else was cold. they also didn't indicate that there would be goat cheese and cranberries on the eggs, which lets be honest, does anyone really like goat cheese? If I knew I would have asked for it to be taken off. His was thrown out too, only thing salvageable was the orange juice I ordered for him. 

Never ever again. Gonna take me a while to get this taste out of my mouth."}
{"text":"First time going here and I loved it! Went on a Monday so it wasn't busy for brunch. I had the blueberry hill, and my partner had the bakers French toast. Both were delicious! Great service, and helpful. Would come back again!"}
{"text":"Old School is a chic brunch and dinner spot on Dundas West. From cool graphics on their chalk board-styled wall to the large windows, Old School invites couples and small families alike to dine at this spacious restaurant.

I ordered their Chicken and Waffles, which was a bit more pricey than what I would usually pay at $18, but I was craving some at the time. The dish wasn't so bad, but I think at that price point, it definitely should have been much more memorable. I also got to sample their popular Blueberry Hill Pancakes from my friend's plate and I definitely recommend it for anyone who plans on having brunch here! So the food can be good, depending on the dish you order.

I love the atmosphere of Old School, especially during the day. It's a lovely restaurant to have a day date at or hang out with friends for a relaxed environment. The space has a very Instagrammable aesthetic, so you can definitely get a cool pic here or two!"}
{"text":"This is Southern Comfort food at its best.  The road crosser fried chicken with vanilla butter and cheddar chive biscuits was AMAZING only matched by the half rack of lean, mean & tender spare ribs.  Both were especially tender and delicious yet not at all salty unlikely most BBQ places I've eaten at in TO.  Now if they can stop some entitled patrons from bringing their pooches to the patio it will be perfect."}
{"text":"I've been here twice in one week for dinner, you could say I'm a fan. Their menu is a bit confusing at first as the all the options can be quite overwhelming. Since they just opened, some of the items that were supposed to be there 24hr (before they started being open 24hr) weren't there during regular hours, so we had to pivot our choices a a few times. Service was a bit slow at times too, but it was always friendly.

We ordered a jug of their apple orchard cocktail (don't remember the name) to start. It was just enough for 3 people, but surprisingly heavy on the alcohol. I've had both the braised pork and chicken on waffles, and both were delicious (especially with their tobasco honey concoction). They have a huge smoker in the back, and we were able to get ribs with the Night Owl menu option (6 ribs and 2 sides, cheaper than a half rack...)"}
{"text":"I saw some pictures of the pancakes named  Blueberry Hills and definitely wanted to try. 
There's a lineup but not so long than I thought on Sunday . We were seated outside on the patio, which is pretty nice, after 15min waiting. 

I ordered Blueberry hills($13) that's the reason I came here, and a friend of mine ordered Hogtown BBQ Benny($16), mixed pulled pork and poached eggs on top with biscuits and salad. Both were absolutely delicious!

The one thing I was disappointed was their slow service leaving us behind. But they seemed nice to customers. 

Overall foods was good, the service was okay. I'll definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Definitely a trendy place. Personally, it's a bit pricey and out of the way for me. 

Service is erratic. Menu is still confusing and many items unavailable at certain times/days. Food was good during weekend brunch. 

Went for Saturday morning brunch. I had the chicken and waffles and blueberry buttermilk pancakes. 

As others have commented, for ~$20 dish of chicken and waffles, you would expect a little more than two pieces of chicken thighs. I didn't mind and had expected this based on past reviews. The fried chicken was quite good. Not too much batter and seasoned just right. The honey-Tabasco that came with it, even better. 

As for the blueberry buttermilk pancakes. Lots of blueberries and fluffy. Also good. I would rate it as above average, but doesn't quite stand out. 

I can't comment on how the food is outside of brunch hours, but it was good when I had it. I would dine here again, but I would not go out of my way to eat at this place."}
{"text":"Came by for a take-out order... Mid-day on a Wednesday so it wasn't too busy at all. Because we ordered food to go, we were able to just hang by the bar and wait for our food. I actually love the decor of the place (super cute). Service time was just okay, one of the employees were very friendly and small talk always helps while waiting on food. Ordered a mushroom sandwich with fries and also the brunch poutine. The food was great overall, even considering the fact that take out containers can make food a bit soggy. I CANNOT WAIT TO TRY THOSE PANCAKES.. and the chicken and waffles... and everything else on the menu. I am looking forward to returning, dining in, and updating this review soon."}
{"text":"After seeing so many amazing food pictures of this place on Instagram, I was beyond excited to finally be able to try this place out!

Service:
We came at around 4pm on a Saturday and was able to sit down within 5 minutes. Our food came out within 15 minutes. Overall service here was good and very welcoming.

Food:
BLUEBERRY HILL PANCAKES:
Blueberry pancakes with bacon, blueberries, maple syrup and topped with brown sugar butter. Pancakes were soft and semi-fluffy. We loved how they added bacon - it gave a savoury taste providing a good contrast from the sweetness. The brown sugar butter tasted amazing and was a good overall topping. 

HOGTOWN BBQ BENNY:
Pulled Pork Eggs Benedict with a BBQ hollandaise sauce served with garden salad and a potato salad.
The pulled pork was delicious and it definitely paired well with the poached eggs and buttery biscuit. Potato and garden salad was also very tasty.

Drawbacks: 
Unfortunately, both the Blueberry Pancakes and Eggs Benedict were served to us a bit on the cold side. Within two bites we noticed that the food had already gone cold. We think that both dishes would have tasted much better if they were served to us hot. 

Overall the restaurant has a welcoming, joyful atmosphere with a wide selection of dishes and we would come back!"}
{"text":"The only thing I liked about this place was the decor and the aesthetic.

I got the hot potato, sausage, and goat cheese omelette and it was so plain. My boyfriend got \"the standard\" and it was also just okay. Nothing amazing.
The milkshakes weren't that great either and they didn't taste like anything.

However, we are not giving up on this place. We may go back to try better, more popular items on the menu. And to also take more pictures because it's just so cute in there!"}
{"text":"Used the reservation system on Yelp to book a table for a Saturday morning and I'm glad I did! Came here for our 10am reservation and it wasn't busy yet... I'd say around 10:30am is when I saw the lines forming at the door. If you're really wanting that brunch, the extra 30min of sleep is not worth the extra hour of waiting at the door! Go early!

Ordered the Blueberry Hill, which is a lot bigger than it looks! The tower of pancakes get bigger as you get to the bottom (4 pancakes), and they are super fluffy!! The brown sugar butter was amazing and I wish they gave me more... The blueberry sauce/jam was just alright, nothing special. Bacon was fried very nicely and again, wish there was more than just 2 strips because the saltiness went very well with the sweetness of the pancake (that is, until I finished all the bacon). 

Service was great- water and coffee never hit the bottom. Although I wish I could've seen the separate coffee menu earlier because drip coffee and specialty coffee like an americano are all $3. I didn't spot regular beverages on the food menu so I figured such beverage menu didn't exist. Would be great if the waitress asked if I was able to take a look at it before asking me what I wanted to order for a drink. I did succumb to a bit of ordering pressure and just spit something out... but not a big deal."}
{"text":"I expect this new 24 hour joint will give the silly 3 a.m. bouncer-monitored queue at the Lakeview some relief. My best friend loves diner food so when he came to visit Toronto this past July, I was excited to show him the newest in the city's collection of comfort-diner-style food. We loved it, rolling in for an early supper at 5 and staying for a few jugs of mojitos until probably 10 or 11 p.m. as a few friends joined in.

I get what people are saying about the menus being \"confusing,\" but I didn't really find it that hard to work through. There's just a lot of stuff crammed in, and perhaps they'd do better to have a book-style menu with pages dedicated to different categories so that there isn't so much too look at all at once. In any case, the formatting of the menu didn't stop my mouth from watering at the wide range of excessive food on offer.

I had a basket of their grilled shrimp and a decked-out sweet potato. The shrimp were delicious, plump and juicy and seasoned perfectly. The sweet potato was also really great, roasted evidently on the grill and stuffed with sour cream and bacon and other goodies. My friend got The Standard breakfast for dinner and loved it. We kept the mojitos coming all evening--they didn't commit the too-common cardinal sin of making theirs cloyingly sweet.

Our server was awesome. Nothing was crazy fast but she was very friendly and happy to answer any and all questions.

The ambiance was good; nothing really to write home about, but it is clean and modern. Overall I think the place is solid and I am keen to come back now that they have had a few more months under their belt. At the end of the day, when I consider what options are available 24/7 in this area of Toronto, Old School is easily at the top of my list."}
{"text":"The service here is atrocious. I hate saying that, but I'm just wanting my fellow foodies to be aware. 

They are generally very busy, and are very slow at seating and serving you, and even worse for checking in on you. Forget trying to grab their attention - somehow they don't see you trying to flag them down. 

The food here is good. Nothing out of this world, but would recommend to stop by if you're in the area (and there's no line up). 

The blueberry pancakes are really popular and my SO had them - and he really enjoyed them. 

Once I had gotten the breakfast with smoked salmon (which was very mediocre/average) and another time I got the Pulled Pork French Toast thing (its...interesting. not a great combo... I tried it so you don't have to)

Price is fair. And they have $10 Mimosas that are pretty popular."}
{"text":"Had the chicken and waffles. Price-wise, definitely not worth the high price of $19. You get one piece of chicken, and its a small thigh. On top of that, chicken was undercooked. Basically pink inside and the skin under the batter was still very raw and gooey. Kind of disgusting. There was close to no syrup as well. The eggs benny was another disappointment. You'd expect a nice runny poached egg but these yolks were hard. It seemed like the chef didn't put much effort into the cooking."}
{"text":"I know a lot of people tend to come here for brunch but I came here for dinner because I wasn't really down to be in a crowded space that day. Here are some things that I really enjoyed from my visit:

1. The location is super dope because you got a bunch of other local spots you can head too after you have your dinner.
2. The interior is super chill and they've got cool graphics on their walls to compliment their theme (chalk board walls and school related drawings). 
3. Their menu is super extensive with a dope selection of cocktails. I don't remember the name but I got their burger and man it was literally the most delicious/juicy burger I've had in awhile. 

I know that most people may have a problem with their service which is exactly why I chose to go later instead of going during rush hour. We were seated right away and I was happy with how involved our server was with us. They also started setting up for live music as we were finishing up our food so I got super excited and ended up sitting at the bar and stayed there for a tad longer."}
{"text":"Was shown to our table and waited over 15 minutes while wait staff ignored us. One of the waitresses spoke loudly about how she was not going to serve our section. This is unacceptable behaviour in a city that is filled with numerous eateries.

The girl who showed us to our table was also oblivious. When I told her the reason we were leaving, she offered no apology nor did she seem to care.

We live in the neighbourhood and eat out often. We will never return here."}
{"text":"EDIT: I'd just like to add that on October 2, 2017: old school was inspected & was given a \"yellow\" rating due to \"operator failed to ensure food is not contaminated/adulterated and failed to maintain hazardous foods at 4c or cooler\".

We tried to come here for the Blueberry Flapjacks, several times but they would consistently be closed; although their hours said otherwise. Tried calling the place after our third time showing up to it closed, no response. 

Later that same day we passed by & finally saw it open! Although we had just finished brunch we stopped by for their flapjacks. 

Our server rushed us in hastily, impatiently waiting for our order. Although our flapjacks came out quickly they weren't as magical as we had hoped (note do not order it with the bacon it makes it overtly sweet). We finished our flapjacks quickly (under their in 15), nothing special we probably would return again if hungry and in the area.

BUT THEN.. Once paying for the bill we were confronted by our server, she asked how the meal was & we said it was decent. Then unexpectedly proceeded to attack us for not paying a tip, with spite in her voice. 

For context we are two students, who felt the service was nothing but her indifferently showing us the table & then slamming our flapjacks down. If we had gotten her coworker (a nice man with a beard) who had been hospital to us although we weren't his customers we would of tipped. REGARDLESS of one's reasons to not tip, no one should be verbally attacked for this. 

We will never return to old school for their terrible service. Our recommendation if you are looking for Blueberry Flapjacks, Chicken & Waffles or anything on their menu done correctly go to School on 70 Fraser Ave. Their servers are courteous, their food is delicious, beautiful patio, correct hours online & their place isn't covered in flies."}
{"text":"Our food was warm at best and took 30 minutes to come out. The waitress was sweet, but never apologized. 

The food was dry and underwhelming..."}
{"text":"Good. Not sure about quality control on food. Great service! Food is a bit pricey for what you get but its ok if there's nothing else open!"}
{"text":"We ordered the Blueberry Hill and it was definitely very satisfying  It was a stack of about 5 pancakes and a layer of bacon in between  On top, was a generous amount of blueberries and brown sugar butter on the side. The pancakes were the perfect texture and thickness  And the bacon had the perfect crunch to them. Every bite was delicious!
-
Staff was friendly but we waited a while until we got seated even though it wasn't too busy. The decor is definitely 'old school' and has a super retro vibe, which we loved!"}
{"text":"Service was awful. 
Not to say they were rude, but just running around with their heads cut off. When we got our coffee it had bright red lipstick on the rim. I know that's not really the front-of-house's fault but they should have caught that before serving the mug to the table. 

The food was okay. 
My omelet had old burnt clumps of potato that were inedible, and a very small amount of goat cheese (the name of the omelet was the \"Potato, Sausage and Goat Cheese Omelette\" so I was pretty disappointed) I think I only had two bites that actually had goat cheese. 

The side salad had apple in it which was a nice touch but someone forgot to add any type of dressing. 

However, the biscuit that came with the omelet was absolutely amazing! I also had the pleasure of having a bite of the blueberry pancakes that were very good.

I understand this place has only been open for a couple weeks and they will have to work out the kinks - so I'll probably give it another shot."}
{"text":"Crazy slow service, but not for a lack of staff. Every table was constantly waiting for somebody to bring them something. Menu is overwhelming but still limited, high prices, and food was just \"good\". Toronto sucks. Don't live here."}
{"text":"Old School is an amazing 24/7 restaurant. Unlike its 24/7 competitors, Old School is actually spotless. All day pancake or chicken & waffles, what better place to impress a girl you picked up at the club."}
{"text":"This was the only place open for brunch near us on New Year's Day and it was delicious. It was super busy and we did get dirty glasses (lipstick and food on em) but the staff corrected this, they were out of many key items on their menu but they did let me substitute for the missing items. Overall, I'd definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I just returned home after a delicious breakfast/brunch at Old School with friends. It was pretty empty when we arrived at 9:30 on Saturday morning, but by the time we left, the patio was full and there were a few inside diners as well. The food was stellar (mainly breakfast items) and the service was wonderfully attentive and super-friendly. Several of my fellow diners had 'The Standard\"--eggs, \"crack\"(bacon), home fries, beans and an amazing cheese and chive biscuit from the in-house bakery. Also served with a bowl of fruit. They have an assortment of muffins and scones which are baked onsite. The blueberry scone today was excellent, with a sugary crust and lots of blueberries in a large, moist, flavourful scone. We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Loved it. We had the traditional 2 egg breakfast and the blueberry pancakes! The breakfast was on point and everything tasted amazing. It's a big place and open 24 hrs. My only reserve is that some items are expensive but from my positive experience so far, definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"It's a cool vibe. I went there for brunch, menu was quite extensive with a good selection of brunch cocktails. I got the croque madame and it was ok. The egg was perfectly fried and the fries on the side were well flavoured. My bf got pancakes, seems to have enjoyed them. The home fries were not worth it - flavourless. They had just updated their menu for the new year so maybe they're still working out kinks. 

It was also really warm in the restaurant bc there are a lot of windows and the sun beats down on it in the morning/early afternoon. Server was laggy and dull."}
