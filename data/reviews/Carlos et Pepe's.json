{"text":"Decent Canadian Mexican food for being so far from the Mexican boarder. Not sure I would go back, but I didn't have any issues with the food or service either."}
{"text":"It was my first time coming to Carlos & Pepe's. They just opened in Vaudreuil not too long ago so I figured why not try it since I'm not too far away. When we got there there was a lineup and the hostess said it's about a 20 minute wait. We didn't mind and went to the bar for a drink.  The bartender made us amazing drinks and within 5 minutes our table was ready to go.  We were starving so we ordered right away. You get chips and salsa to start for free and we ordered jalapeno poppers.  They were probably one of the best jalapenos poppers I have had in a long time.  I then got my main meal which was shrimp tacos, they were absolutely delicious.  They were made with a tequila sauce and spicy crema. I would go back just for that!"}
{"text":"There are very few Mexican restaurants in the Montreal area.  Nice Resturant decor. The drink menu is great. They do not take reservations . The staff was friendly. I ordered the mango chicken which was great . Everyone was happy with what they ordered . This is a great little Resturant and we will be back."}
{"text":"Very interesting decor. The menu has a good selection. The staff was very friendly and service was good. We arrived early 5:15 and got seated immediately. 30 mins later it was packed and got a little noisy. We started with salsa and chips. The salsa had a nice kick. The mango chicken was tender favourable and had a great kick . Nice portion. The chicken fiestas were also tender. The only issue was little lettuce and cheese for toppings.  This is a lot better then  3 Amigos
We will be back"}
{"text":"Very good Mexican food in Vaudreuil-Dorion finally! The margaritas are huge and the portions great! Ordered an entree of Fire Cracked Shrimp tacos which were awesome, however I made the mistake by ordering shrimp tacos again as the main course, so the range of flavors did not vary. Still delicious though! Staff was great but very busy...to be expected on a Sunday. PS: My wife would like to chime I and say DO NOT ORDER BURGERS from here...they suck the big one...no flavor"}
