{"text":"Best mariscos out here . Incredible authentic mexican seafood . It is a combination of good food and music with the mariachi in there. It is worth every penny."}
{"text":"La Palapa is my first and last stop in Vegas. I get there and order a Cocktail (Campechana) and a Michelada. Let the party begin. Before I leave Vegas I stop in for the same thing and oyster shooters. The food is fantastic, the Michelada's are the best on the West Coast outside of Mexico."}
{"text":"This place recently changed owners and since it did its been a great place to hang out have drinks and the food is great! Live music on fri, sat and sunday... A must try!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat and have a couple of beers!!  Great service and great food!!  Must try their prepared beer.  Freshly made Mexican waters are the best!!!  Recently painted and clean!!!  Highly recommend to everyone.  Waitresses are extremely nice and always making sure the customer is content."}
{"text":"I went to this place thinking it was another place and they were very rude. A waitress started to talk to me in Spanish and I told her sorry I didn't understand she laughed and went to find someone else. So about after 5minutes another woman came out and asked me what I wanted. I told her I ordered over the phone and she began arguing with me, which I responded with that sorry maybe I got the wrong place. She asked me what I ordered I told her and she told me that they don't sell that there. I apologized and she was very rude. I was leaving and in Spanish she told me to hurry up. Also to add to the rudeness of their employees to a potential customer they had a good bit of flies flying around their restaurant. I probably would have thought about trying this place at some point since I enjoy trying new places. But after my experience with the ridiculously poor customer service and which seems to be possible non sanitary conditions I want to warn as many people as I can away from this place."}
{"text":"Was there for a Las Vegas trip and wanted some authentic mexican food and most of all, I was craving a michelada so bad. 
For food this restaurant is very good and tasty but the michelada was dissapointing. Took one drink and had to get something else. The micheladas I'm used to drinking have a nice spicy mixture with beer with a spicy salt mix on the rim but they don't make it like that there. It had no flavor at all not even beer flavor just tasted like water and regular salt. Not good sorry"}
{"text":"A hidden gem for seafood in particular for shrimp coktails and ceviche.  They have the best Micheladas I have ever tasted and make it a point to drop in everytime I am in town with family and or friends."}
{"text":"La Palapa was a fairly authentic Mexican restaurant. It had the colors on the outside and very friendly service from the staff. I really enjoyed the flavorful carne asada and beans. I wasn't crazy about the yellow-style type of rice. I guess because I'm used to tomato-based rice. The beef tamale was also good and not dried out as I often encounter when eating tamales. The waitress was kind, friendly and accommodating that she made our meal very pleasant. The one unusual thing that I did not like were all the people coming up to you to make money or begging. There was an accordion player, a trio of singers, a duet that kept singing at our table although we said no thank you, a little boy that was selling cookies, a trumpet player, a dancer, and then, I think, two Americans because they spoke perfect English and looked American, begging for money because someone in their family was dying of cancer. All this while we were eating or trying to eat. It was the strangest experience that I ever had dining and reminded me of when I was in Cabo San Lucas when people would wake you up on the beach to sell something to you (Hello...can't you see that I'm sleeping!). But that's Mexico for you. I can't imagine why the owner would allow all these people to come in and disturb the customers. I imagine this is authentic to how the restaurants are in Mexico. I don't think I'll go back because of that."}
{"text":"Stopped in while I was in Pittsburgh for the weekend. AMAZING Mexican food! It was very authentic. The staff were nice and explained what things were as I'm not too familiar with Mexican food.  I would definitely recommend stopping at La Palapa the next time you are in the Strip District."}
{"text":"BY FAR MY FAVORITE MEXICAN FOOD. The service is great and food tastes delicious. Not only do they have Mexican but some American food as well. They have really great tasting steak with vegetables and the pastas taste really good! If you're ever in Las Vegas and craving Mexican food, I recommend stopping by at La Palapa! You will defiantly be satisfied. Every time I visit Las Vegas, I always stop here to eat and I'm never disappointed. Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Writing this review because there are so many debates about whether or not Las Vegas can serve up good Mexican food.

I was referred to La Palapa by a friend who hails from Mexico, and is picky about their food.  Especially mariscos!  I myself, having spent a significant number of years being part of a Mexican family, have a discerning pallet when it comes to Mexican fare.

I arrived at La Palapa with my friend and his family, and upon sitting down he was immediately greeted with a michelada 'preparada'.  This is one of the best inventions ever, so I quickly followed suit, while presented with several options of the cerveza to be used in the drink.  I'm a traditionalist....Modelo Especial is my standard.  I have to say, this preparada was unique to anything I've had elsewhere, including those in Mexico City.  It was much lighter in tomato than most, but had great spicey goodness!  The 2nd one was better than the 1st!

I split a tasting of shrimp and octopus ceviche cocktail and a combination shrimp and fish taco.  All was phenomenal.  I think there was a full pound of 21-25 shrimp in my ceviche, and the lightly fried goodness in the tacos was amazing.  Super fresh and awesome.  Even did a dozen raw oysters on the 1/2 shell as appetizer.  a) I wouldn't risk this at 90% of the restaurants in Vegas and b) I never thought sliders with lime juice and Tapatio would be awesome!  I was wrong!

Needless to say, this was worth the drive off the beaten path.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat. Everything is amazing, I usually order the agua chiles, shrimp cocktail, shrimp tacos and Mechaladas. If you like seafood you gotta try it."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. My first cóctel de camarón was in México and by comparison nothing comes close. Palapa on the other hand is as good as can be expected. I always go back when in in Vegas."}
{"text":"This wasn't where I planned to eat, but it's where I ended up.  I'm glad that everything else didn't work out.  The salsa was the best I've had since some salsa in a tiny restaurant outside Chicago in 1972.  But don't let you think that means I'm some corn-fed midwesterner whose idea of wild seasoning is a dash of cinnamon or paprika--my dad was a chilihead from way back.  This was fresh, sharp, FLAVORFUL and spicy salsa with fresh (not even wilted) cilantro, tomatoes, onions and I don't know the rest.  I had the entire bowl wiped out before my order arrived.  It is that good.

Having learned the hard way that if you order what you think is \"enough\" at any Latino restaurant in this neighborhood that you will need a moving truck to get the leftovers home--never mind that everything is reasonable to the point of cheap, I only ordered a fish taco and a shrimp taco, and a glass of melon agua fresca.  The agua fresca came in a glass that could give Lake Mead competition, but oh, it was good.  I've never had it before, and a mix of melon, probably a bit of sugar, cold water and ice cubes was absolutely perfect on a hot evening.  As for the tacos, the batter on both the fish and the shrimp was superb, light and golden--comparable to the batter on a very good tempura.  The cabbage slaw was fresh, not limp, the dressing was simple (probably just a bit of sour cream/crema mexicana), and the tortillas were perceptibly fresh, too.  Both tacos were very generous--I think there were at least 8 large shrimp in the shrimp taco.  The fish was perfectly cooked inside, as well--not even Gordon Ramsay would have fussed about it being over- or undercooked.  And...NOTHING tasted greasy.

My only warning about this place is that the menu isn't completely translated (although most of it is).  Even so, my junior-high-school and riding-the-bus Spanish got me through whatever wasn't translated.  And the staff didn't laugh at my very strange Spanish pronunciation (Spanish overlaid with a German-influenced Russian accent).  The waitresses were quick and friendly.

This is the kind of food I hoped for in Las Vegas.  I found it in a little strip mall next to the new Super King Ranch Market."}
{"text":"Soooo Gooood!!!!!!!! The 7 Seas soup and michaledas are fantastic! Oh and the oysters topped with ceviche! Yum!"}
{"text":"I love the mushroom and beef tacos. The other tacos are great, too. I really enjoy having the convenience provided with this location in the Pittsburgh Public market. Plus who can beat 3 tacos for $9.5."}
{"text":"I found this place for lunch with a coworker. Great spot for authentic Mexican food!! The carne asada tacos were great as well as the chips and salsa and bean dip. They have agua frescas, they looked really good. I stuck to my ice water with lime  Great place for Cinco de Mayo!!"}
{"text":"Going to the Strip makes me wish I had more than one stomach. I'm not a Pittsburgher; I visit because my boyfriend has family here and on our trips I get fed pretty well. That said, I've recently started making sure that some of the limited real estate in my stomach gets dedicated to eating in the Strip, with the biggest parcel of space going to La Palapa. Admittedly, I have a soft spot for Mexican food, perhaps because although I live in Kentucky now, I grew up in Southern California. Let me say that I'm not grading on a curve based on what may or may not be available in the region. La Palapa is good, period.

You'll find the stall in the Public Market under the thatched roof that is the business's namesake. On each visit I've been served by the same very friendly man (likely the owner?). I get whatever tamales are available and they've always been great. They're corn husk tamales (as opposed to banana leaf). I challenge you to pick a favorite between the red and the green sauces. The beans and rice should not be missed. I'm normally more of a pinto bean girl but these black beans are seriously great. I hope to eventually try the empanadas but again, just one stomach, so we'll see if I ever make it that far.

In the event that a tourist is reading this, the address that is currently listed on the Yelp page is the South Side location. This review is specifically for the location in The Strip, which is in the Public Market on 2401 Penn Avenue."}
{"text":"One reviewer said it best, \"a hidden gem\"; particularly this side of Vegas, you can't go wrong, plenty of great dishes, great service with a smile. Try it with friends, family, large groups, you'll love it. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Everything I try here is great! Seriously! Everything. I suggest the try 3 or the tamales, and if they have watermelon water, you MUST try it!"}
{"text":"Best tacos in Pittsburgh! I have tried their chicken, barbacoa, pulled pork, corned beef, and they are all so delicious! My favorite  is the potato and poblano pepper filling, which they have added to their permanent menu. A must try!!"}
{"text":"I love the fish tacos and there
Preparada beer prices are not that good this place definitely needs to be upgrade it's to dark and food  small portion for their price."}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food, and the waitresses are sweet and willing to accommodate. I came hoping for pozole; the waitress let me know it wasn't available that day but gave me some great alternatives. Food was great; just like my mami used to make. Try it. This place is truly a hidden treasure."}
{"text":"Under staffed, there's always people nothing you at your table to buy stuff. Prices are ok butplace is loud & bathrooms are a mess, never any paper towels."}
{"text":"I love this place, reason being they have BOMB aguachiles!
The ambience is pretty cool, comfortable and more than enough room for for everyone ... unlike other places that are all crowded. The waitresses are pretty nice and are pretty consistent when it comes to checking up in you etc.
The music is perfect, not too loud. Overall I really like this restaurant."}
{"text":"The food is nothing special and a little overpriced. Seafood doesn't seem really fresh. I actually prefer the Mexican markets taqueria next door, better food and prices. The only saving grace for this place is the drinks. They have some of the best preparadas in Vegas. So go here for the drinks but there are many better food options in the area."}
{"text":"This is a GIANT restaurant! I had never been to this side of town but came here for a restaurant.com coupon. FYI- that coupon didn't work!!

All of the fried fish dishes we tried were very good. Price for 3 of us to eat (with 1 beer and 1 horchata) was about $45. We had a cerviche that was quite good too.

This is the kind of place you'd expect random people to walk in and sell you roses and candy bars. The service was attentive but there also weren't very many people in the restaurant on a Friday night at 6pm. I wish this place wasn't so far north away from the city center. I'd come here more often if it was."}
{"text":"Best shrimp tacos ever! Best cerveza preparadas ever! Awesome service! Nobody ever gives me a hard time for not speaking Spanish.....probably cuz I'm Asian. There are places that expect me to speak Spanish cuz they assume I am Latina but it's all good over here.

Their fish and shrimp tacos are battered and fried, served with shredded cabbage, pico de gallo, and a white cream sauce with a lemon wedge. If I can recall they are huge and cost about $3 - $3.50. Not bad at all cuz they are not greedy here. The campachana cocktail with shrimp and octopus always tastes so fresh. I have yet to find it better anywhere else.

Their cerveza preparadas are made with a concoction of shrimp stock, lime juice, hot sauce and whatever beer of your choosing. They are served in a frosty goblet that makes the beer so delicious on a hot day, after a long day at work, after a long night of partying--the morning after of course, or just any old freaking time they're open. The first few sips have that icey layer of frost on them that I just love so much. Almost like a beer slurpee, kinda....not really. Just go there and get one. Only then will you know exactly what i mean."}
{"text":"La Palapa.  I am sitting in a 3.5 star place, but I just can't give them four stars.  I ordered a beef quesadilla because I went to Clarion, and I know that the Clarion beef barn has some of the best beef ever.  The quesadilla was packed with meat, a little short on cheese, but came with some salsa.  I think it was $3.50.

While the quesadilla was good, I don't have any desire to go back.  I think the shortage of good Mexican food within Pittsburgh makes people over-hype places like this.  It's really just OK.  Not bad if you work in the area, but I think there are better options."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and i came to eat on a Monday , after a long day at work we really wanted delicious authentic Mexican food with a cold preparada ..... we usually go to the place next door called los molcajetes which I'll write about in a different review ...... but we came in and it was dead there were maybe a couple people here but anyways we ordered a couple preparadas which tasted like plain beer which wasn't so bad we asked for some extra limes and a side of clam juice which was all
It needed and some salt ..... for dinner I ordered the cheese enchiladas and 3 asada tacos on the side and my girlfriend had the milanesa plate with beans and rice and my son had some beans and rice .......ok let me start by saying that the cook on the kitchen must have been in a bad mood because my \" enchiladas \" tasted like the lady opened a can of tomatoe sauce and just threw it on top of the tortillas and added cheese !! I was extremely upset ! And still am , I can't believe these people expect for a young Hispanic like myself who likes to cook Mexican food from grandpas recipe , to eat that garbage they call enchiladas ..........  this place is a disgrace to all Mexican restaurants...... this place has been here forever and I still can't believe they served that garbage .......other then the \"enchiladas \" my girlfriends plate of milanesa seemed to be ok , the steak wasn't too chewy and it was seasoned just enough ..... and the beans and rice were ok as well ..... sorry La Palapa but this young Hispanic who considers him self a Mexican food fanatic !! Won't be coming back ever again unless the owner decided to redeem his restaurant and wants to pay for my next dinner here , this place will
Never see me again !!"}
{"text":"Excellent authentic Mexican food.

I walked past the La Palapa stand three or four times in the strip without ever giving it a second look. Big mistake. This place is a hidden gem with incredible Mexican food. The tamales are great and the homemade mole they are topped with is packed with flavor. I also loved the black beans with bacon-- such a good side.

The price is a bit high for a food stand but I suppose the large portions and quality ingredients slightly justify the cost. I highly recommend trying La Palapa at least once."}
{"text":"Just ok. The ceviche was ok it needed to be doctored up. The fish tacos were good and plenty. They do charge you for everything.  We ordered a rice and beans plate for our little one and asked for cucumbers and tomatoes and was charged for that. The waitress came by 2 times and was ok nothing I'm this restaurant would make me want to come back."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's my \"new\" favorite Mexican restaurant in town (see previous review for Ricardo's for the \"old favorite). Been coming here for about 2 years now and it never ceases to be an amazing, authentic, experience. 

The restaurant is family owned and operated. They remember us by name when we come in. The food is fantastic. You really can't go wrong, but my favorite dishes are Oysters with Ceviche on top, Seafood Tostadas, Camarones Rancheros, and Shrimp Enchiladas. 

Also, you have to try the prebalada. It's like a michelada, but with shrimp stock instead of Clamato. It's pretty much the best and great for hangovers. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Just had an amazing beef quesadilla and an awesome  chicken tamale with a verde mole.  Both were fantastically delicious.  This stall in the Pittsburgh Public Market delivers authentic eats at an extremely fair price. I will be back again, again, again and again."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for about 4 years now and the food and service have always been very good. Our favorite waitress is Belen who is always super friendly and on top of her stuff! I love the shrimp cocktails and shrimp tostadas. They serve the best Michelada.  The fish ceviche tostadas and oysters are good here."}
{"text":"WARNING TO VEGETARIANS...DO NOT GO HERE. 
I was questioned by the waitress, \"Do you even like Mexican food?\"  I do. I REALLY do. However, I do not like YOUR Mexican food.....

My boyfriend and I were vacationing in Vegas, and wanted to eat a a local taqueria. Using the highly recommended ratings on yelp, we decided to hit this joint on the way out to the airport. 

This was our last outing in Vegas, and after four days of excess and all nighters, I was admittedly cranky, and we stopped here just so I could get out of the car. 


I was super pleased with the chips and salsa, so tasty! I was super excited for the food.Until I got the menu...

That said, NOTHING on the menu was veggie friendly, and it was primarily seafood. I asked the waitress for the tortilla accompanied by black beans, lettuce, tomato, mexican queso and salsa verde. I also asked for avocado on the side. I really wanted to stress that no meat should be anywherwe near my plate, which prompted the the nasty question from the waitress, which got us off on the wrong foot. I have even had veggie friendly foodstuff IN MEXICO, but due to time constraints and the fact I am unable to understand insults in Spanish-- I did'nt want to start in on it, so I let that snideness ride. 

My boyfriend ordered a Torta, and was told several muinutes later that the kitchen was not making those today, so he settled for a chicken empanada. This place was also out of soda, so I ordered and orange-mango juice. 

After a VERY long wait for a seemingly simple order at a seemingly empty restaurant, I got served a nasty surprise of a gross thick tortilla covered with a smatter of sour cream and a quartered avocado smeared randomly on said tortilla. The whole dish was DROWNING in a sea of runny salsa verde. No beans, no rice, no lettuce. no tomato.  My bf was also non plussed by his unflavorful empanada. The juice tasted like super watered down Goya. I had two bites and two drinks- and I was done. I would have sent mine back, but we waited FOREVER, and at that point we needed to haul ass to get to the airport.
 
This hot mess was $16 bucks. Pretty reasonable for two people,no?  But, if you wanted to follow menu prices--- This bill was supposed to be about $10. 

I give this one star because the salsa and chips were good, and apparently I can't give zero stars."}
{"text":"Traditional Mexican food & drinks - michelada and horchata are the specialties!
Everything is super cheap and everything we've tried (quesadilla, fish taco, chorizo dip) was good. It's definitely on my list anytime I'm in the area. Trying the ceviche next visit!"}
{"text":"Yelp Alert!   Near the office, this is my favorite place to go for fish tacos (see pics above) -- their salsa is fresh and flavorful, too.   Newly upholstered booths reflect their focus on seafood -- which despite the \"couldn't-be-farther-from-the-ocean-location\" is really really good!  

If I'm feeling under the weather, they have great soups -- nothing like albondigas loaded with fresh jalapenos, cilantro and lime to help chase the cold away... one day in particular, my server fixed me her version of \"get well\" drink (sparkling salt water -- with lots of lime -- it's an acquired taste, but it definitely helped... not to mention it was incredibly kind.)

At lunchtime, there's really only one server and she's attentive and caring -- and very proud of the food they serve which is great.  She usually tries to seat us in the bigger room, but I really like the smaller table with the glassed in (?) bar in the center closest to the kitchen.

Update:  Today, I grabbed a menu so I could give you all a little more information on prices and their menu options - so, here goes -- Fish Tacos are $3 each -- Their small shrimp \"coctail\" is 6.95 -- large is 9.99 -- they also have ceviche, crab, octopus, mixed (pick any 2 seafoods), oysters, abalone and clams. I love that they have a Vuelve a la Vida -- only large  - which means Return to Life ...hmmm....

Their 7 Mares is $13.95 -- and the bowls are enormous.

Seafood Tostadas -- see above for choices -- start at @ 2.50 and go up to 9.99 for a super mixed version -- 

They have a page of Dinner plates served with rice, beans, salad and tortillas (showcasing all their seafood options, 5 shrimp dinners, plus a Huachinango  -- a whole fried red snapper, which I adore).  

There's another page of Especialidades Mexicanas -- with breakfast signatures like Huevos Rancheros and Nopales con Huevo, tamales -- both meat and sweet versions, chimichangas and quesadillas.  Another page of Antojitos with Picaditas, sopes, queso fundido (simple, chorizo and con hongos available!)  

Then they have a random page with Americanized sandwiches and salads using their mise en place  -- tuna salad, tuna melt -- with two sizes of menudo hidden here  -- which totally cracks me up (!)  

Then yet another page of Especialidades Mexicanas -- featuring huraches, gorditas, empanads, panbasos (meat choices include pollo, chicharron, deshebrada, picadillo, costilla, carne asada), enchiladas (rojas, verdes, camaron, mole, too) and caldos (pollo, albondigas, res, pozole -- note move menudo here!) 

And finally, the last page of their menu features their beverages -- from freshly squeezed juices (carrot with celery or orange or beet juice), agua frescas (limon, naranja, mango, papaya, pina, horchata, guanabana, jamaica and melon) -- milk shakes (yes, they have a soursop milkshake!) to beers ($3 for domestic, $3.50 for mexican, $4.50 for a \"cerveza preparada\" - a red beer, I think) -- and then last but not least, a tiny mention of their singular dessert -- flan...

I forgot to mention they include their catering options -- or large party portions for big groups -- and their Lobster Dinner which I'm intrigued by -- prepared with butter, LA Palapa (called their house specialty), with garlic butter or diabla...hmmmm.....

Aside from the fact that the menu is chock full of really tasty, all homemade options -- with photographs that look like I took them (and that's not saying much) -- don't miss this very humble, yet completely genuine Mexican slip past you -- I can't imagine anyone being disappointed."}
{"text":"Not in the greatest part of LV but for lunch why not. There was only 1 other party dinning  when I arrived.

Started off with ice tea which is was huge. I ordered the 2 combo tostada with octopus and crab - it was large and decent but the octopus was chopped to fine. I followed with a shrimp taco and a side of rice. The taco was ginormous and stuffed with deep fried shrimp, cabbage and a light white sauce - it was very good. The rice was also tasty and lightly flavored.

The service was OK, the waitress put white sauce on my taco when I requested it on the side thankfully it was light otherwise I would have sent it back. 

I suggest the shrimp tacos, you can go wrong and if you eat two you'll be set."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, but sucks that they allow all those solicitors in their establishment. I get it, people have to make money, but geeze, can I enjoy a peaceful dinner with my husband without someone coming to our table trying to sell us something?! You have the lady with the bootleg dvds, the \"deaf\" man selling candy bags, oh & the guy selling the fake roses.....better yet, let's send a child in to sell something. Very annoying!"}
{"text":"It was our first time here and we were pretty disappointed. Service was good but the food was very bland. Shrimp cocktail was tasteless and you can tell the fish from fish tacos were fried in old oil. Maybe just stick to the Micheladas."}
{"text":"La Palapa is a Mexican seafood restaurant on the north side of town offering incredibly fresh underwater fare at incredibly affordable prices. 

I insist that you start with a Modelo Especial served michelada style, or 'preparado' ($4). This is a light Mexican beer laced with hot sauce and fresh lime juice, served ice cold in a massive salt rimmed goblet. Sounds strange, I know, but once you try it you'll be hooked. I actually had a similar drink served to us in a plastic cup at the HUGE Broadacres swap meet on the north end LVB, which I also recommend for delicious cheap eats, but this is the first time (and certainly not the last) I've had it in a restaurant.

Then, you should order the fish taco ($3). This was primarily desirable to me because of the price, but once it came to the table I knew I wouldn't be let down. It needed a shot of acidity (may I recommend their house salsa, a dash of Tapatio, and a squeeze of lemon?) but the beer battered fish was hot, crispy, and oh so good.

The entree of shrimp served \"a la palapa\" (I love saying their name, try it!) came to the table looking one note and blonde, and not in the appealing sort of way men like. I was amazed, however, after taking the first bite of snappy, sweet shrimp. It was flavored with bay leaves and some sort of dried pepper, and tasted fantastic, especially when bundled up in a warm tortilla with their great refried beans and rice.

I also very much enjoyed the combination tostada of octopus (pulpo) and shrimp (camaron) ($3.75). There aren't many places outside of the Mediterranean you can get great octopus, but this was fantastic considering our desert surroundings. It was tender, yet firm, and very fresh. In fact, none of the seafood I've had here has been anything but fresh, so if you like offerings of the sea but don't want to drown in debt, La Palapa should be on your 'must visit' restaurant list.

PS. Do you like flan? Then don't pass on dessert. La Palapa's version is as creamy as cheesecake. I'm generally a poster child for self-restraint when it comes to over-indulging in foods that are very bad for you (I'm part foodie, part health nut), but I can only attribute that to my strict evaluation of whether or not something is worth the calories. The flan here most certainly is, so I left only a token bite."}
{"text":"La Palapa used to be an unsuspecting stand in the Strip District, a hidden gem to stumble upon for the best authentic Mexican grub in the city.  Now, La Palapa has moved to the South Side (taking over Thai Me Up's old location)--and the food as only gotten better.

If you don't want to try a taco or quesadilla, which are excellent, I'm a huge fan of their mole chicken (mole poblano con pollo). A cup of their soup goes a long way, too, and they have a solid variety to choose from--tortilla, black bean, fish, and vegetarian.

I haven't tried any of their desserts yet, but I can't wait to come back and try the flan. It's a small space, fairly unsuspecting, but it's hard to be let down with something this authentic."}
{"text":"I come here all the time! One of my favorite spots for Mexican seafood. The shrimp cocktail is really good and plentiful if you get the large one. My favorite is the molcajete for two it's more than enough for two. Try the super tostada it has all the ceviche varieties that they make. I'm a regular here, the staff it's always courteous and friendly."}
{"text":"I've actually a big fan of this place been coming here for 6 years or more and I can say I've tried everything on the menu and it's really good and waitress are nice and friendly and know us already.  The only reason I give it a 4 because of the restrooms are not appropriate for the restaurant and theirs always people selling stuff and nothing us when they eat over all grey place, and bomb mincheladas"}
{"text":"Everytime I'm in town, this place is on my checklist, great food and drinks. And the drinks and good, you red too try there micheladas with the shrimp  soup, not Clamato."}
{"text":"I'd been wanting to try this place for a while and I have to say while it was good, it wasnt' what I had envisioned. First, I loved the music selection. All of Vicente's greatest hits. The sign near the ladies room said they have karaoke on sat. nights. I ordered menudo and I don't th ink I'd order it again. It had onion?? who puts onions in menudo? My bf ordered chilaquiles and they were good. gotta say. He also ordered a gordita which fell into last place. The salsa was def. not my favorite. WAAY too much onion and salsa at room temp not the greatest. If it had been a tad bit colder it would have tasted better. I'll definitely go back for a huarache or try their flautas, but definitely ask what has onions and what doesnt."}
{"text":"Good authentic Mexican food.  La Palapa started at the Public Market and moved with the Public Market to this location.  The tamales are good with the homemade mole.  Nice flavor.  Only one tamale left so decided to have a taco with it.  Tacos are good too.  The menu is limited but some good Mexican food at a good price.  The server mentioned that La Palapa uses Clarion foods beef for the beef tacos."}
{"text":"Service is everything to me, second time here and food was great but if I have to get up to ask for something because I waited 10 minutes and he server or host were too busy catching up that they didn't notice I needed something. I ordered a shrimp taco  which was delicious, queso fundido, and oysters.the agua chile order by my friend was extremely spicy more than we are used too. I suggest the employees inform of the spicyness so that food doesn't go to waste 

Translation in Spanish

El servicio es todo para mí, está fue mi segunda vez aquí y aunque la comida estuvo buena pero si me tengo que levantar después de esperar 10 minutos  que la mesera regresará  por qué las damas estaban en buena conversación no se dieron cuenta que las estaba llamando. En esta ocasión pero un taco de camarón muy delicioso, queso fundido y ostiones , Pero el agua chile que pidió mi pareja estaba muy picoso a como estamos acostumbrados. Tal vez los empleados deben mencionar algo para que la comida no se eche a perder."}
{"text":"Still my favorite spot I love there beers and fish tacos . There Mocajetes are bomb too"}
{"text":"This place was recommended to my by a friend and I must say it's authentic Mexican food.  The servers here are very welcoming and really helpful with the menu.  The vibe of the place is as if you are in the islands of somewhere along the coast.  

There's a bar and there are tv's, but the TVs by the bar are in need of an upgrade.  

The portions here are pretty big and you definitely get full off your plate.  I got the flautas plate, it's topped with cheese and lettuce and a side of salsa verde; they offer chicken or beef so I got both.  It's a plate for sharing and will fill your tummy.  The drink sizes here are regular or LARGE so the large is good for sharing."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since theirs been a review. Went for fish tacos. They by far the best in Las Vegas. Service is prompt and courteous. Order was \"right on\".  Fish comes on two tacos a bed of cabbage, with diced tomatoes/onion and celantro and a white sauce. They are delicious. This is a seafood restaurant. Everything is freshly made to order. Whatever you order you will enjoy. For the price you can't go wrong. Fish tacos are 3.00 each....go for it."}
{"text":"La Palapa is great! Their food was delcious and the service was really good. The waitress gave me lotsa chips and salsa, always checked on my drink, and got my food fast. Their salsa is SOOOOOO good. The chips were fresh and not greasy. I had menudo because I was feeling slightly hungover that day . They have a HUGE menu. I would like to try lots of other things here. The restaurant is very clean and relaxing.  The prices are decent too. I will definatley be going back soon."}
{"text":"Best tacos ever!!! My only issue here is deciding what I want.. Thursday the market is open late so it's a great place for a quick dinner. I've loved everything I had here and the owner is super nice! The chips are amazing, I can't help but get them. I love the tacos in every variety! The vegetarian potato taco is Soo good!"}
{"text":"Food was very good, loved the fish n shrimp tavos. Also tried the shrimp n octopus coctail n was good too. One bad thing was thar tge eervers all kept esting behind the counter"}
{"text":"Let down, especially when compared to another Mexican restaurant real close by.  

Started with a shrimp cocktail.  It was very boring, shrimp with tomato juice, a scant amount of cucumbers and one small piece of avocado.  There was very little flavor to it.  The steak fajitas tasted ok.  The steak was tender, a little on the sweet side, but it was swimming in grease.  They were served with 2 small tortillas, we had to ask for more. 

The preperadas were a major disappointment, I drove across town to get a good preperada.  It just tasted like a little tomato juice with beer.  It did not even have a lime with it.  

The service was ok.  I was super irritated when a lady singing and playing the guitar on the other side of the restaurant  came over and demanded a tip.  At first I thought she was asking if we wanted her to play for us, so I said \"no thanks.\"  Then she put her hand out and demanded a tip.  She repeated herself 10 times.  I didn't come here to hear her play an out of tune guitar, I simply came here to have a nice lunch. 

Too many other options for good Mexican food around."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today. Got two tostadas shrimp 
And 2 shrimp and octopus cocktails. 
And a order or wings and fries. 
Before I could finish I gotten sick and Had to puke. 
Seafood did not seem fresh and I'm still feeling sick after I've gotten home. A no go for me never again."}
{"text":"The best authentic Mexican food in town! Hands down! The micheladas are thirst quenching also! I usually order mine with Tecate beer. The food always tastes fresh every time I've came!"}
{"text":"Every time I come to Vegas I have to come and visit this place... food is so good u won't regret it micheladas are on point and service is amazing till next time ladies!!"}
{"text":"Spot on best authentic Mexican in the city.  Just had pork tamales and want more.  Run to these guys as they are future rock stars of Pittsburgh's Mexican scene!!"}
{"text":"The food at this place is so great! They give you a good amount and the price is not expensive at all for what you get! I had a abalone octopus cocktail, usually at other places they'll fill the cup with vegetables rather than meat this place added little vegetables and a whole lot of meat!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed our dinner there. Great service, good and prices. Had 1/2 dozen oysters with ceviche on top, grilled langastino with garlic butter, fried ice cream and strawberry margarita. Seafood was flavorful and fresh! Bill was only $40 for everything! There was a guitar player there, music a bit loud for my taste and they went around asking for tips."}
