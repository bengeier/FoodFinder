{"text":"Local Bistro delivers:  excellent tasting food that is well prepared and presented, ample portions, efficient friendly service, a nice casual modern setting and fair prices.  Second visit was on a busy Friday night.  Arrived early for our reservation and the place was buzzing--all tables filled and bar seats taken.  Hostesses pleasantly greeted us assured us table would be ready soon and it was.  Restaurant was busy and noisy and some guests notice what nearby tables are served.  Ample wine selection by the glass.  Started with Ahi Tuna Tartar.  Small squares of delicious marinated tuna served in a circular mold.  One order ample for two.  The daily chicken special consisted of a 1/2 tender toast chicken served with lots of fresh roasted vegetables and sauce.  I like chicken with fairly crisp skin and moist interior and this chicken met the mark.  Veggies outstanding--just al dente enough.  Tiramisu dessert top notch and ample for two--or three.  Nearby tables had steaks, fries, mac n cheese and all looked fantastic.  People were eating outside on chilly night; suspect they did not have reservations.  Look forward to returning soon."}
{"text":"Yummy! A little bit of this and a little bit of that and a whole LOTTA LOVE! My belly and my heart were digging on each other;) The service is exceptional too!"}
{"text":"This place has awesome reviews but I found the food wasnt anything special, sweet and spicy pizza was good, french onion soup was good chix parm was good but served with no pasta and bland tom sauce ciopinni didnt look like pix people posted at all and the black seafood linguini was bland, dont believe the hype!"}
{"text":"Excellent meal...excellent service..excellent ambiance

{"text":"Updated review: our last few experiences here have been poor sadly. The food has been just OK, and the staff REALLY slow. The portions are huge but at cost of flavor. Had the brisket omelette, and it was just mushy and huge and so so so oily."}
{"text":"We saw Local Bistro in the neighborhood and thought it looked inviting so we booked a reservation for dinner. The bar and restaurant were full of people and the atmosphere was lively.  We shared a Greek salad which was a great portion for a starter; the flavors were fresh and worked well together. We ordered wild salmon and substituted the saffron risotto. The food definitely deserved 4 stars very tasty but not exceptional. The service was excellent from our waiter, Ryan. Several of the management staff came by to thank us for coming to the restaurant and also brought a complementary dessert which was very good as well. Our only complaint (although hardly worth mentioning) was the very small bit of bread to be shared between two people. All in all we would definitely come back and enjoyed our experience."}
{"text":"First visit - very impressed.  Staff was great, (sorry, can't remember bartender's name - female, dark hair - super professional), food was amazing.  Wild Mushroom Pizza to die for.   Only problem will be trying something new because I liked it so much!"}
{"text":"Best brunch up here in the North!! Monkey bread, mimosas, eggs. All of it fresh and delicious!  Dinner and Happy Hours are good too but OMG- BRUNCH!!!!"}
{"text":"Food is great but their popularity has gone to their heads.  We WERE almost weekly customers and have been treated poorly so we have decided not to go there any more."}
{"text":"Good food and service but incredibly loud after the recent renovation in July.  Too many hard surfaces and a high ceiling. I could barely hear my friend 3ft away from me and my ears were literally ringing when I left.   
Too bad. They have everything thing else going for them."}
{"text":"We visit this place quiet often and we always love the food. But recently we experienced the best service we've ever had in Arizona. You must request Barri, she gave the most flawless service and it made for the best dinning experience!"}
{"text":"Great service, quality food. Carpaccio the best! The menu caters to many tastes and completes a valued diner selection. The new floor plan allows an extended outdoor dining experience which will really be popular during the cooler months. Local has always had a popular bar crowd but the old one limited seating. The new one is great."}
{"text":"Wow. Truly one the best places we've eaten at since coming to the Phoenix area! Sitting at the bar was a happy accident. From the Social Hour menu you can only get at the bar, we ate like a king & queen. The Drunken Bread was wonderful. The calamari was delicious. The burger almost made us hurt ourselves.  Everything tasted terrific! Good atmosphere & great staff put it over the top! We will be back even if it means driving up from Maricopa!"}
{"text":"Started with the Drunk Bread and it was tasty.  A unique combination of crusty bread and cheese.  It was a good way to start.

I had the linguine and clams and loved it.  Generous portion of clams and the sauce was awesome.  My wife had a salad and enjoyed it as well.

The staff was helpful, friendly and made sure we were well taken care of.

Environment was comfortable, but a little on the loud side, but not so bad that we couldn't carry on a conversation without yelling."}
{"text":"A Decent Choice

This is a decent choice for happy hour, although I think it ends early (about 6).  For happy hour, pizza is a good choice, as well as the calimari.  We also tried the drunk bread cooked in white wine and gruyere.  It was delicious but super-rich.  Way too much for one or two people--best shared a bite each with a group of 4 or so.   The bar area lacks a bit of atmosphere, but overall a decent meal.   No views from the bar except that of the parking lot."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and was very impressed! I got the meatball sandwich and it was delicious! The service was good too. Looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"I feel that Local Bistro offers an amazing selection of food at an affordable price. Take the pork chop, for example. Both times I've ordered it, It was moist and delicious and complimented with fingerling potatoes and fresh spinach. I recommend the entrees to everyone and for the rest--well, you can get pasta and pizza everywhere."}
{"text":"First visit, and I would like to try it again because I think it could have just been an off night.  I do really like the fact that it is a local place in North Scottsdale, and like the upscale casual design.  Their menu is good too, with 3 risotto options - wow.  Our waiter seemed very professional and good at what he does, but maybe had too many tables.  We waited maybe 20 minutes after getting our drinks before he took our order, and one of our dishes had obviously been sitting under the lamp for too long which turned the pasta dish into one big gummy lump.  When brought to his attention, his response was to offer a spoon? Check took a very long time as well and we actually just handed our credit card to the next table over where our waiter was rather than wait for the check.  Pardon the pun, but maybe too much on his plate?  However, it is worth while to go back and try again because of all the things that worked and probability that we just came at the wrong time and see if I can't bump this review up a couple notches."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner with friends.  Black linguine entree made fresh at the restaurant.Yum. Very unique.  Great service and food.  Like many Scottsdale restaurants, outdoor patio a little small and parking lot facing.  Busy Friday night, so we were seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time, but otherwise a wonderful dining experience."}
{"text":"They don't have the cioppino on the summer menu, but the Chef will make it upon request. Excellent!"}
{"text":"Manager invited us back and treated us like Royalty. We have since been back and greatly enjoyed the food, service and ambience.  One of our favorite local places."}
{"text":"I stopped in with a client to have lunch at the Local Bistro.  The service was fast, the service was friendly and timely, and the food was excellent.  The portions were very large.  I ate my burger but my clients had to box theirs up. (Not a criticism, just an observation.)  The food was presented on a bread board which we thought was very creative. Plates are sooooo last year.  The only negative was that the prices were pretty high.  I liked the restaurant.  I would come back again but next time I'll remember to take out a personal loan before I go."}
{"text":"Great Sunday Brunch!  The California Benedict was light and the eggs perfectly cooked. The Enchilada skillet was great with tons of chicken and great sauce.  From the minute you enter, the host was welcoming, and Susie the waitress was terrific, you know you will return!"}
{"text":"Had dinner with the family about a week and a half ago.  Ask for Jonathon, he's an engaging and wonderful waiter who knows how to take care of his customers!  Great food on the awesome patio.  Never had a bad meal here.  Enjoy the relaxing atmosphere and great wine selection."}
{"text":"The Local Bistro is a great place in north scottsdale. They have a good happy hour and the food + service is excellent every single time. However, I wish I could get one message to the owner and parent company... You have a great recipe, but the night time supervisor doesn't understand the hospitality business or more importantly how to motivate employees to ensure customers have a favorable all round dining experience. I'm not sure why anyone would retain her in a capacity of managment. I have had her interrupt our server talking to us and repremand bartenders directly in front of customers. She takes the fun out of dining out when you witness this and know these individuals don't deserve to be treated that way. She apparently doesn't appreciate that bartenders and servers are customer facing and when you treat them with such disrespect they go back to serving customers disgruntled. They compliment the dining experience and they can't enjoy work when she is breathing down their neck. She is the only bad recipe at the Local Bistro. I wish I knew her name in case there is more than one supervisor, but something tells me anyone who works at the Local B knows exactly who I am talking about. Kuddos to the staff who stay on and tolerate her management style. Hopefully the voice of the customer will support you. You do a great job every time we are there. Thanks for continuing your hospitality under the circumstances. Keep your chin up!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times never to be disappointed, the menu is diverse , the service exceptional , the Martini's very scientific (mixology)  the deserts are out body experience try banana bread pudding . Only reason they didn't receive 5 stars is because that perfect meal will be served in heaven.

{"text":"Loooooove this restaurant so much! Salmon and rotisserie chicken are superb along with some amazing wines on hand."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Modern decor without trying too hard. The risottos and the fish were both delicious. Appetizer with burrata, arugula, prosciutto, and dried figs was also a highlight.  
One member of our party is difficult to please, but even she was happy with the food here, which says a lot. This one's bound to become a favorite!"}
{"text":"Excellent choice for Social(happy hour). Limited menu items, but all the items on the card are delicious! The hamburger for $5 is a steal! Another favorite is the shrimp santa lucia. My fabolute favorite drink is the Makers Mark slushi... I can handle 2.. Can you say potent!!! Anyway, go and try it. You won't be dissapointed."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance and good energy level .  The chicken Parmesan is enormous . worth the price because you have dinner for the next 3 nights!"}
{"text":"Loved the ambiance. Our server was ok, not great. Nice enough, but not very knowledgable on the menu. Hubby had the salmon, it was fine but nothing special. I had the short-rib pasta, again fine but nothing special. Really want to like this place as location is good and it has a cozy feel. Will try again in a few weeks."}
{"text":"you must order the Elvis. it is amazing. best French toast I have ever had. the bread is so so fluffy and the warm peanut butter is the best. the portion is huge and you won't leave hungry! I ordered the Elvis and the eggs Benedict and I would say skip the eggs Benedict and get this instead."}
{"text":"First let me preface : we have been coming here & enjoying this restaurant for 4 years. Lately we can't help but notice that friendly staff we've enjoyed in the past seem to be gone. And management is not concerned with customer service whatsoever.  We had a reservation @ Local Bistro tonite & showed up 10 minutes early. The restaurant was empty - a sea of empty tables. We were escorted to a small non-remarkable 2-top & when we asked for a slightly larger, better situated table, we were made to wait while our \"seater\" went to check. He came back to inform that the only table avail was outside. Not what we wanted. He said that many tables were booked starting @ 630 ... We asked to see the manager & he informed he WAS the manager! BRANDON is his name. Seriously ... A manager can't figure out how to accommodate a party of two in an empty restaurant? What a joke. So we left. And won't be back for a long time. Went to Market Street Kitchen in DC Ranch. Should have come here first. Dinner & service at MSK was superb as usual. :)"}
{"text":"Service was terrific, and we were even comped a desert for being first-timers. However I just couldn't rate this any higher, as the food was mediocre at best. I had no idea bread could be so overcooked it became tougher than shoe leather. My clams were also very over-cooked... seemed like old, frozen clams that were immediately cooked without having been thawed first. A few of them were closer to appropriately cooked. Higher food quality with better ability to prep, and they would have something. NIce ambiance, good service, but I won't go back as there just is no value in the food itself."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! I love their mussel appetizer that is available at happy hour for $5! The broth is absolutely amazing and it can be sopped up with the big piece of grilled bread that comes with it. While your waiting for your food, they bring this awesome bread that is served warm  in a paper bag with a very fresh and flavorful tomato sauce to spread on it. I ususally go with my parents and we can easily go through three bags of their bread!  However, we've learned that it is worth it to save room for the main courses. The squid ink linguine and the pasta with bolognese are definitely my favorite pasta dishes and I always have a hard time deciding between the two. They also have a pretty good selection of seafood which changes daily. This is one of my favorite local restaurants to go to."}
{"text":"Food was amazing!!! We had the seafood omelet and the primavera frittata so good! The service was equally great. I'll be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times.  First time, I ordered sea bass.  It was okay, but not worth the price.  It was a bit oily as were the garnishes. 
Enjoyed the Spinach salad I had, the second time I went.  My kids love the burgers and the pizzas. Great kids menu.   
Service is inconsistent and there's somewhat of a snobby feeling in the air from the staff.  Not sure why...just feel it there when I walk in.  I think the greeters are just not friendly."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, good service, been here for lunch twice, the food is only ok. Maybe dinner is better? I love their sister restaurant Sumo Maya. But I don't think I'll come here again."}
{"text":"Had a Wonderful dinner: prosciutto pizza, AMAZING! Steak Salad: SO SATISFYING! And Pana cotta. But the best was the service, Johnathon has a great attitude and couldn't have taken better care of my table!! We will be back Johnathon!"}
{"text":"Local Bistro is one of my favorite places. Whether I go with my family or just with my husband we always have a great time. The atmosphere is casually upscale, yet laid back enough that you can bring children (although ours are older and usually well behaved). Some of our favorite dishes are the clams, bolognese, chicken parmigiano, and the Spanish risotto. Sadly, I dream about some of these dishes, they are that good. Brian is our waiter of choice. He's absolutely great. And lastly the wine list is very good and the prices are extremely reasonable. We love Local Bistro!"}
{"text":"Local Bistro is a quaint restaurant in the North Scottsdale area.  We decided to give it a try based on the positive Yelp reviews.  Started off with the popular Drunk Bread.  It was decent.  Basically, bread flavored with white wine and you dip it in a skillet of melted cheese.  If you're a cheese lover, you'll probably enjoy this dish.  Otherwise, I found it to be somewhat too heavy on the wine, which detracted from the actual bread flavor.  For entrees, we had the truffle risotto and the pork schnitzel (I think this was a special for the night).  The truffle risotto was pretty good.  Nicely cooked pasta.  Pork Schnitzel was disappointing.  I felt like this was only marginally better than Shake N' Bake.

The price is high for the quality of the food.

Decor is nice.  However, be warned that the restaurant is very loud.  The service was friendly, albeit on the slow end.

If you're looking for a local restaurant with a few signature dishes, Local Bistro is questionably worth a try.  I just wasn't impressed enough to become a regular."}
{"text":"I found the quality fine (not spectacular) but way overpriced for pasta.  I certainly appreciate fine Italian food, but this didn't fall into that category.  I think a better matched price for what I got would have brought me back.  As it currently stands, I wouldn't spend that much money for this.  Their service was intermittent at best.  I realize it was a Saturday night but isn't that what they want and should expect on the weekend?"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place! I have been here a handful of times now and everything I have ordered has been amazing. The drunk bread with prosciutto is always are go- to appetizer, so good! The service is always outstanding, wine prices are very reasonable, and the food is always very fresh. My favorite dish is the seafood linguine, absolutely delicious. I have also tried the chicken parmigiano, Spanish risotto, lobster bisque, tagliatelle and mushrooms (really good) and the bolognese- literally every dish has met or exceeded our expectations. The desserts are also very good, the creme brulee and tiramisu have literally been some of the best I have had. If you haven't been here before it is definitely a \"must try!\""}
{"text":"Hands down best bolognese in town! Christine provided top notch service and management was super attentive and even brought us a yummy dessert just because it was my friends first time in. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. I have been here multiple times and every single time I am amazed with how delicious their dishes are. They use amazing ingredients and you can really taste the difference. My brother is in love with their burger and orders it every time. Their drunk bread is very rich and reminds me of cheese fondue, definitely worth sharing with your party. Their seafood linguine is absolutely amazing and I was shocked with how much seafood it came with; I definitely got my money's worth. Similarly the seafood salad had copious amounts of fresh, delicious seafood. The wild mushroom and swiss sandwich was bursting with a variety of different mushrooms and cheese and came with a side salad. There were enough mushrooms and cheese inside it to make a whole other sandwich. You honestly can't go wrong with a single item on the menu. I have yet to come for their brunch but I will be sure to try it out in the near future."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. I was there solo and ate at the bar. Friendly patrons and staff. Their homemade pappardelle with bolognese rivaled my favorite at Piccolo Angolo in NYC. Will definitely become a regular here."}
{"text":"Met some friends for lunch today at Local Bistro and was blown away by the NIcoise Salad with ahi. It was wonderful and there is no skimping on the \"good bits\". Lots of capers and olives and the ahi was absolutely delicious. My husband has a seafood salad and was every bit as pleased with his meal. So glad this is close to home! Wonderful service and a nice atmosphere-a real winner."}
{"text":"Midnight Egg Sandwich is the best in the world!!!! The atmosphere kicks this place up a notch. On Saturdays and Sundays they have unlimited mimosas which are the cats meow. On Sundays I've seen a band there a few times with a packed bar and everyone having a great Sunday Funday. The food will not disappoint. Their brioche bun is out of control! Get the midnight egg sandwich for bfast or the burger for lunch. Get the fries too!!!"}
{"text":"It took 45 minutes for a salad. The restaurant was empty, so not sure what took so long. The steak salad was $16 for 4 small pieces of steak. It was very disappointing, and we left lunch starving. The waiter was very friendly. Was very discouraged that management didn't come over. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Love this place! My family had dinner there right before Christmas and the food and service was outstanding! From our cocktails to after dinner drinks, our evening was extremely enjoyable! Our evening began with our waiter, Jonathan who was so knowledgeable and could not have been more accommodating. He really made our evening so much more fun! Lots of excellent suggestions and we loved all of it! Would definitely go to Local Bistro again very soon  and request Jonathan!"}
{"text":"I took my other half out for a quiet, romantic date tonight. At the suggestion of fellow Yelpers, I decided to surprise him with the Local Bistro, which neither of us had eaten at before. 

We both loved it! The decor inside is very simple and elegant, with a wide, open dining room encased with wine stacks. We ended up eating on the patio, which considering the beautiful weather was wonderful. I didn't notice any heater or misters on the patio, though, so hopefully they get something in place in time for the summer. 

We had the drunken bread and it was delicious. It only lasted on our table for maybe two of us before it was devoured entirely. You can definitely taste the wine, which I enjoy, I know some people don't...

I ordered the truffle mac n' cheese, which, if I'm honest, puts this same dish at the Yard House to shame! The sauce is so creamy, yet with a strong presence of the truffle oil. I ordered mine with chicken and would recommend also perhaps adding pancetta, since the dish is pretty light without any protein. In any case, it was so good that my man kept eating off my plate and I was scraping the bowl clean.

He ordered the chicken parmigiana, which he liked a lot, especially the homemade marinara. It also came with a small arugula salad, which was not our favorite. 

At the end of our meal, our server, Paul recommended that we use open table to get reservations in order to avoid getting seated on the patio.  We actually HAD made reservations for this dinner, but our table was given away. When I told him this, he became upset and went inside, only to emerge a few minutes later with a free desert.  It was a custard served with wafers, nutella and raspberry wine sauce. I will order that before every meal from now on. It was fabulous and we really appreciated the gesture. 

This place also has a great brunch menu so we hope to be back soon!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful bottle of wine and delicious apps on the outside patio on Friday evening.  The service was great and friendly.  Was fun to sit with my friends and get to know other patrons who were sitting in the outdoor 'living room' space"}
{"text":"Ate here recently and was very disappointed. Overpriced, and execution was sloppy all the way around - each dish was clumsier than the next (oily and soggy, unbalanced or uninspiring flavor). Oh well, maybe I caught them on a bad day, but next time I will go somewhere else."}
{"text":"4pm and all 20 seats at happy hour bar were full but the rest of the restaurant, both patio and inside were completely empty.  We have a family of five and asked if they would honor happy on patio or nearby.  Talked to manager and she could care less. Will say Bartender was great and tried to accommodate us.  Turn away a whole family when you have an empty restaurant. Can't imagine how that's a smart business decision."}
{"text":"Really loved it! The atmosphere was nice, the service was exceptional and attentive. We all loved our food and it was well presented with generous portions. Can't wait to go back and bring more friends. The best new place I've been to in Scottsdale in a looong time. Bold to open a new place in this economy, but think this one will be a winner.

{"text":"Had dinner tonight and was very impressed. From the ambiance to the food and service, everything was amazing. May be my new favorite place. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have been a faithful delighted patron of local bistro for many years. I have been remiss in not doing a yelp review to sing my praises. Mea culpa my favorite chef Andrés, German and the great team. I shall attempt to remedy that right now. 

I see quite a few reviews talk about the drunk bread. Forget it. Check yourself before you wreck yourself. It's not that it's not great- it's that there are WAY too many other things you must try. I insist. Let me explain: 

Tips: 
This is a place you can go alone and sit at the bar. It's a private experience if you want or can be communal and suddenly everyone is your friend and sometimes offers of food sharing come about lol well that's what happens to me. I have brought so many people here. all my girlfriends love going there and doing the \" bar experience\". It's fun!

The brunch menu is off the chain good and great price, especially if you think about the other breakfast place option in the same parking lot (good egg) there really isn't a price diffenrece. Their coffee/lattes are delicious, the bottomless mimosas when you buy food is like hitting the jackpot. I have been guilty of at least 3\4 times going for brunch and then suddenly  it's 3 pm and time to eat again.  woops. Hehe Sunday funday right?

Appetizers- just try the burrata. It is SOoooo good it makes me talk OUTLOUD. How embarrassing. And it just looks sexy. Their beef carpaccio is just as good as ocean club. Try it. Go ahead. 

Salads- if you are not ordering salads here you are just making a huge mistake. It's a whole other level of simplicity in the presentation and ingredients and so unbelievably good. Arugala salad? Yea yup get that.  Seafood salad-oh yea! 

Entrees- oh my. Where do I start??? Chicken Parmesan is big delicious and crispy, not to mention lunch for tomorrow. Their bolagnese is so incredibly consistently good. Their winner is the black linguine seafood pasta. Wow. Loaded up with tons of seafood pieces of garlic and yumness. Steak frites is off the hook always good and their fries are evil, addicting and yes delicious. 

  Desserts- oh so many. Fresh made there. Not ordered in. Chocolate lava never disappointments but what makes you close your eyes and (Uh moan?)  is the pannacotta or the cheesecake. Try it with any cocktail or a nice glass of wine from the incredible selection they have. 

This is not just my favorite all around place hands down, it's my favorite place to take a new person and turn them out while watching them enjoy the food and flavors as they exclaim-why didn't I know about this place!!!  

 Well, now you know. Enjoy"}
{"text":"What a great spot!!  Fabulous atmosphere, and I can't complain about anything on the menu!"}
{"text":"We like this restaurant but it seems the only time the restaurant seems to run well is when the owner is there. All the way from the hostess being polite and tentative to good service from servers and bartenders is much better on owner days. We had a very rude hostess several weeks ago and of vise the owner was not present. We just jabbed low expectations now if we frequent local bistro."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what that happy hour just cost me but I do not care...

Great wine selection, great bouillabaisse appetizer, and I am a hero to my lady and my clients. 

\"When are we coming back?\" was the dialogue on our way out the door..."}
{"text":"We have always liked this place a lot, despite the usual cacophony exacerbated by the brick wall & high ceilings. Last night seemed even louder than usual, and neither the food nor the service was up to their usual standards. My gazpacho was good (albeit quite small), but only moderately chilled. The truffle Mac & cheese was noticeably lacking any truffle flavoring, and my wife's pork tenderloin with peach sauce had no apparent sauce. It also took quite a long time to be waited on & to get our entrees. We made reservations at at early time (6:00), but still got seated at one of the small tables in the back where one person has to sit on the long cushion. I am short and sitting here did not allow me to have any back support. We will likely return at some point, but not soon."}
{"text":"Ana is the best server ever! We came for brunch and had an amazing time! We ordered the prosciutto omelette, egg, chicken & waffle, drunken enchilada, bottomless mimosas, and the pineapple upside down pancake. OMG! All of it was AMAZING!! So delicious! The service was superb. Ana was awesome! Ask for her!  I love this place!!"}
{"text":"We've been to Local Bistro a number of times.  We quit for a while because 82 degree wine did not sit well.  Glad that after the remodel they put in a wine room and in addition the place looks absolutely wonderful. Unfortunately, and I hope that this is a one off event the food was just not up to par.  The go to risotto was way salty and the bolognese was greasy. Hoping this was just a bad night, as this has been a staple in Scottsdale. 

It's been a month or so and I'm glad to say our previous experience was just a one off night. Ordered same entree's and whatever was wrong before was right this time.   Glad to have our staple back."}
{"text":"Wow.  Worst experience in several years.  Seated at 6:30. Everything very slow.  Onion soup delivered LATE and was cold..... Asked for main course three times.  Manager  requested twice and finally showed up at 7:45..... Stated would be another 15 minutes ... Left without dinner......Will never go back."}
{"text":"Great bar and servers! We love it every time we eat here. Food is overall very tasty...tagliatelle bolognese one of our favs. Thx local bistro for a great time!"}
{"text":"We are visiting Arizona on vacation and stopped in the Local Bistro. We enjoyed a fantastic dinner of black linguini & seafood, plus Tagliatelle and wild mushrooms with added grilled shrimp. The service, the atmosphere and the food were top-notch. We couldn't have asked for a better evening. John and Timothy both were awesome."}
{"text":"I dined in on Tuesday, and I had the spanish risotto. It was excellent! This was my first time, and when the complimentary dessert came to my boyfriend and me, I tried striking up a conversation with the female manager. Although the restaurant did not seem too busy, she made us feel like an inconvenience. We felt uncomfortable around her because of how she talked to us in such a degrading manner. AND SHE IS SUPPOSED TO BE A MANAGER? HOW CAN A PERSON BE A MANAGER AND NOT LET YOUR GUESTS FEEL WELCOME?! Bottom line, we did not feel appreciated as guests. What a shame when the food was so great... certainly we will not be returning, as well as letting others know about such POOR MANAGEMENT"}
{"text":"The service can be spotty and slow, but the food and wine are always on!  Local Bistro is a nice surprise on the corner of a Fry's shopping center.  I've tried almost all of the apps and recommend them all though I will say that the drunk bread is kind of sickening good.  It's delicious but one of those things that you just don't feel good about but can't stop eating...  Their salads are huge.  They've got an incredible wine list - anywhere I can find the Prisoner is a winner for me.  

The only downside is that the service is spotty.   There's an obnoxious footnote on the menu about how great food might require more time so thanks for your patience.  Yeah, whatever.  Sometimes it seems that the kitchen is just in the weeds and the servers disappear for long period of time so beverage glasses are empty.  Two recent business lunches took 1.5 -1.75 hours.  Our party's entrees came out at different times which is always awkward, and our server was MIA for a good portion of that."}
{"text":"New remodel looks great. Wine list is priced moderately great appetizers and excellent pasta. Service has always been top notch, and they had live music which added to the experience."}
{"text":"Had a reservation at 7pm. Arrived at 6:52. Hostess insisted we had to wait until 7 though there are at LEAST ten tables open. Good food but WTF!?!?! Horrible service!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time with reservations, they don't work.   Go to O`Donohues, much friendlier atmosphere."}
{"text":"We had a great experience at Local Bistro. I went with my family, there were 9 of us and we all loved our food. As an Italian family we appreciate good Italian food. Here are some of the dishes we enjoyed. The burrata and prosciutto appetizer was great. I love to cook with burrata but I rarely see it on a menu. The bresciola and spinach salad was very tasty. I rarely see bresciola on a menu either. We also liked the arugula salad as well. My husband loves to make bolognese and thought the bolognese pappardelle was fantastic. The cioppino had a nice variety of good fish and the pizzas were authentic. 
Our server was very welled trained, she not only knew the menu but she could answer every question my sometimes difficult father asked of her. That alone, was quite impressive!
We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food is quite good but very loud environment. Difficult to carry on conversation due to the sound bouncing off the brick walls and unfinished ceiling."}
{"text":"Local ?? Sysco is not local!! People don't know but. Spiga is way better. You can taste not good product. I love to eat fresh and good. Here to much salt and not good service. So sorry we don't like Sysco. We can tell the difference."}
{"text":"Tonight six of us went to Local Bistro with 5:30 reservations. To say we were impressed was an understatement. I have eaten at many restaurants, but none match the level of customer service that we received tonight. Christina, our food server, was sensational. Despite many requests from us, she filled each request with professionalism and aplomb. 

The food was fantastic. From the salads to the entrees, everyone was humming. When the broasted chicken came out a little underdone for one person in our party, not only did they graciously take it back to cook it a little longer, but brought out a small salad at their expense so that our guest wouldn't be sitting there while everyone else was eating. The chicken did come out a few minutes later and it was perfect. The BBQ ribs were to die for, the salmon was great, and the New York was terrific. In addition, we enjoyed a bottle of Rombauer chardonnay for only $48. To top off the evening, the manager brought out three complimentary deserts for us to enjoy.

What more could you ask for -- great food, great service, and great atmosphere. We will all be back, and I would encourage any of you in the Scottsdale area to give Local Bistro a try."}
{"text":"I must say, that after Eddie Chans left, I had a large, gaping hole in my heart. In hopes that another Asian restaurant would take its place, I was initially disappointed to see another \"pizza\" place go in... (you know, with ZPizza in the SAME shopping center). But, I really did love the feel of this place, and I came hungry, which was a plus. We ordered the drunk bread appetizer, which, in my personal opinion, was the best thing I ate. Wine, cheese, and bread... if it had chocolate somewhere, it would be a fusion of all my greatest loves. We also ordered the beef carpaccio. This dish left much to be desired. I am not afraid of carpaccio.... give it to me nice and raw.... their carpaccio was well seasoned, but, in my opinion, was a bit overcooked. I had the veggie pizza, and it was very good. Veggies were flavorful and perfectly cooked, and the pizza was good. Good, not GREAT (I am partial to Sauce). Dessert was the berry calzone and I was blown away. Big enough to share, and not too sweet, with nutella instead of chocolate. I loved it. I am however, bummed that I just had a glass of wine here, now reading other reviews about their stellar cocktails. My favorite thing was the feel of this place. I love Postino Wine Bar in Phoenix, but its such a hike, and Local really has that feel. Very neighborhood, great bar, good apps. Service is really good, too. They aren't all over you, and I came with people who I don't often see, so we chat a lot, and he didn't make us feel rushed, which was really nice. I recommend it, especially if you are a local in Grayhawk or Desert Ridge."}
{"text":"First Time and surprised! The food was exceptional. Little touches made the servings unique and quite tasty. It's great to find local restaurants with such outstanding fare, service and ambiance. I look forward to becoming a regular at Local Bistro."}
{"text":"First time back since the renovation and was truly impressed. Cool vibe and great crowd. Service was spot on, friendly and efficient. Food amazing. Order the house made burrata with fried eggplant, you won't regret it. Will be back!!"}
{"text":"We went here for happy hour. We tried a few apps and found everything to be excellent. So we returned a few more times and tried their entrees which were excellent. The atmosphere is nice and contemporary.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Went to Local Bistro for lunch this week.  Salad nicoise was ok, portion was relatively small.  There was plenty of nicely cooked ahi tuna and eggs, but I did expect more greens in the salad.  Also thought there'd be green beans (but glad there were no potatoes)."}
{"text":"This place is popular and for good reason. The pizza is above average, but if you are going there I would partake in some skilfully crafted italian dishes. The macaroni and cheese is unique as it comes. The rolled flat noodle with bolognese sauce was worth the price of admission. If you are going there, go hungry, get your carb, sauce, melted cheese, a glass of wine, and get happy."}
{"text":"We ordered a sangria, chicken parmigiana, and the special: trout (came with potatoes and greens). The trout tasted good. The trout was juicy and came with lemon. The potatoes were sort of dry, but then again I guess most potatoes come out dry. The chicken parmigiana was pretty good as well. We actually came here for the sangria, which was the only bad thing about this place. I think they should try making the Sangrias more fruity tasting and less wine tasting. I could barely taste pineapple in the drink. I am not sure I will be back. The location is nice, maybe I will give it another try in the future."}
{"text":"Downhill it is!

Tried Local Bistro again tonight - drunk bread, risotto, arugula salad, prosciutto pizza.

The drunk bread was delicious, however, $10 for a big slice of bread - it wasn't that delicious.  

Risotto was good but not exceptional.  

Arugula salad was a little wilted and the dressing was gross, too sweet and gross.  

Prosciutto pizza was not good...the prosciutto had very tough fat running through it, flavor was too sweet (FYI, it is not heated as part of the pizza) and the pizza base itself was completely bland.  \"Wood fired\" may be true, I'm sure there is a wood that burns that gives off no flavor whatsoever - if it had said \"toaster oven fired\" it would have better set my expectations.

Extra bread on the side - stale.

One last thing I'll mention, everything was stone cold except for the salad, that was slightly warm.

Local Bistro - I want you to be great.  I like your menu and you are close to my house.  Can't someone stage an intervention with the kitchen staff??"}
{"text":"Ordered food to go for a late lunch.  They said it would be 35-40 minutes that in itself is a long time given it was a weekday and already 1:30ish but we ordered anyway.  I Arrived at 35 minutes and it was ready.   Paid $65 for Chicken Parmesan, Beets, House Salad and their Truffle Risotto,  Thought it was expensive but figured it was worth it because it was probably very good.  Arrived home well within 5 minutes.  Chicken Parm was cold and a little overcooked and greasy but more importantly they forgot to include Marinara sauce which killed it for me.  The Beet dish should have been categorized as a Salad with beets in it.  My Girlfriend almost never orders salad and would not have ordered it if she knew it was a salad.  House salad was weak consisting of mixed wild greens that were warmer than room temp and two small pieces of a cherry tomato.   Risotto was good but by itself does not stand up as a meal.   I did eat half of the lettuce in the salad that was in the beet salad and ended up throwing everything else away.   Called them back and was offered to be taken care of next time I came in.   I demanded some form of reimbursement for today and was offered a refund of my Chicken Parm only by a Manager but then negotiated for a refund of the Beets.  Will not go there again.  As of the writing of this review my credit card was charged for the meal but not refunded for anything."}
{"text":"Not sure what all the hoopla is about... menu LOOKed good, typically overpriced as often found in Scottsdale but sadly, our food wasn't very good.   My husband's pasta was pretty much inedible.  Ok, it WAS listed as a \"spicy\" tomato sauce, but holy cow - it was as hot as Thai, but without the flavor!  Most of it went untouched.  Shared my \"wild mushroom pizza\" because at least it was edible, not good, but edible.  Overloaded with oily, over-garlicky arugula, (was it supposed to pass as a salad AND pizza?).  We won't be back - too much pretension, too pricy for what you get, and lousy food to boot.  Service was good though... otherwise it would have been one star."}
{"text":"Nice place, ate here tonight for the first time. Typical noise for today 's restaurants but food was excellent and priced well. Excellent service as well."}
{"text":"We're always seeking out yummy dining spots north of the 101 in Scottsdale, and we've found a winner!  Although this part of the patio faces nothing but the parking lot, it was a beautiful evening and just perfect for dining al fresco.

The Drunk Bread (crusty bread soaked in white wine + melted gruyère cheese) is AMAZING! We could have had one order per person.  Sharing with three other people -- well, it wasn't enough.  This is the most delicious starter hubby and I have experienced in eons, five-star restaurants included.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  It's served piping hot in a cast iron skillet . . . so delectable!

Entrees were delicious as well.  Our waiter was right on the money when I asked him what the most popular dish is  . . .  the Papardelle Bolognese was so flavorful with huge bits of veal, beef and pork in a light red sauce.  The portion was bountiful!  Hubby and a friend had the Steak Fritte (hangar steak) and french fries.  It was buttery and so tender, especially for hangar steak, you could almost cut it without a knife. The other diner had the spaghetti al crudo - tomato, olives, capers, anchovies + garlic - and she enjoyed every bite.  They even made it with whole wheat pasta at her request.  They are happy to do this as long as you understand that it takes about 20 minutes longer than usual.

Service was good, not superior, but definitely above average. No rushing, no hovering.  The only glitch was that I was looking forward to having the fig and vanilla bean bellini (minus the champagne plus vodka) and they were out of fig :(  Since we were celebrating two birthdays, they brought us two desserts on the house.  My hubby and friends were in Seventh Heaven with the bread pudding while I loved the chocolate mocha like mousse concoction. We were more than full when we finished.

There are so many tantalizing items on the menu -- lots of pastas, pizzas, salad and more hefty options - that we have to go back for more.  I am thrilled to have Local Bistro truly local for me!  Buon Appetito!"}
{"text":"We were out shopping and stopped by this place randomly for dinner and WOW! What a hidden gem! The seafood linguine and sea bass were both delicious, and the Manhattan was worth ordering a second one. But most impressive was how they treated our 4 year old son. The kid's meal was the most impressive thing for $4.95 that I've ever seen. Our son ordered a pepperoni pizza - which was a 12\" wood fired pizza with artisan pepperoni that also came with a glass of milk and gelato. The service was impeccable and if we weren't here on vacation, we would definitely come back soon!"}
{"text":"Tried lunch last Friday, unfriendly greeting. Had to wait for table as hostess tried to work which of the seventeen empty tables we could sit out

Dirty water glass, not my lipstick color, food okay. Cold pasta 

Expensive and not a single person thanked us or bade farewell 

I bid farewell to local bistro"}
{"text":"Where's that ZERO?! It all begins when you arrive!  
We leave Barrett Jackson. Arrive at 4:40, twenty minutes early for our 5pm RESERVATION!   ONE table is occupied.   ONE.  Hostess seats us at a banquette seat as you enter the dining room.  You know.  The one where every single person passing will bump into the person seated in the corner chair?!   We ask for a different table.  There are 20-30 open tables. Our seater goes back to hostess stand. The IMPORTANT hostess returns.  She says to me, \"I'd really appreciate it if you would sit here. I have a lot of very tight reservations tonite.\"  Huh?  So people requested a specific table??  \"Well.  No.  Well some did.\"  \"But
our reservations are very tight.\"  WHAT does that even mean?  \"Oh never mind!  I'll move you!\"  Instead, we walked out.   Went to Isabella's. 
Had fun from the minute we arrived WITHOUT reservations.  Friendly Hostess told us she'd squeeze us in.   We told her we'd be leaving at 5:40 for a movie (if only the snotty one at LB had asked!!) We had great service. Great food. Love their Brushetta.  And, the Mac & Cheese!!"}
{"text":"MUST GO HERE!!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!

Tried this place for an early dinner last night. OMG, everything was amazing! 

Waitstaff: friendly, knowledgeable, attentive, professional... I didn't catch her name, but our receipt stated \"Barri\" on it.

Food:  
Appetizer was Beef Carpacio - YUM-MY!! So fresh & tasty. Just wish they would give a little more lavosh or foccacia or whatever yummy thing you stacked the beef, arugula & avocado on. Our 16 yr old looked at it and made a comment, but as soon as he tried it, he joined in the rush to try to get as much of it as he could between the 3 of us.

Soup of the day was a chowdery, potato, bacon, chicken, something... Just yummy!

Chicken Parmesan - best we have ever tasted!  Great flavor, big portion, yum!

Alfredo with chicken - tasty! And the chicken wasn't just grilled it had some Pesto coating that just added to the flavors.

Truffle risotto with shrimp - OMG, I loved the flavor, the creamy, somewhat Smokey risotto, all the flavors (including edible flowers) blended very nicely. Nice size portion so I had some to take home.

Panna cotta - small, but perfect size to end a great dinner with a little sweet, Italian custard, fresh berries and cream. YUM!

Berries and cream (because we can't spell nor pronounce the French name) - very yummy and refreshing. Son said it was \"amazing\"!

We will definitely be back to try more dishes. Can't wait to bring friends here....or just keep coming back, just us.

Go. Here.  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, warm and inviting restaurant with superb service.  Favorites so far: prosciutto barata appetizer and burned butter, butternut squash ravioli, both were so fabulous my average arugula salad with beets didn't matter.  The meal was nicely paced as well, neither rushed nor too slow, left us lingering just enough to enjoy the atmosphere and relax.  Will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Love this place! We originally were trying to go to snooze, but with the lonngggg wait, we yelped other brunch options and this place popped up. I had the Benedict with crab and yum! Service was great, our mimosas were always filled and the manager was walking around very helpful too. We will for sure be back! I actually like this place more than snooze too, and that was our spot.. So that says something"}
{"text":"We were looking for a nearby location that served bottomless mimosas with brunch and we stumbled upon Local Bistro.  We went around 10:30 am on a Saturday and it was mostly empty except for a couple of people so we elected to sit at the bar.  The bar stools were awesome - cushioned and swivel.  The entire inside is clean and nicely decorated - good atmosphere.  And unlike most places in Phoenix the entire bar is inside which is nice for really hot days to ensure there is ample room at the bar.

The bottomless mimosas (or bloody marys) are $12 and our server truly never let us see the bottom of our glass, even three hours later.  We asked selected the drunken enchiladas which were chicken enchiladas with 2 over easy eggs and the short rib omelette based on our servers top two recommendations.  The food was in general pretty good/not bad.  It wasn't amazing and my eggs were slightly (just slightly) overcooked (brunch sin!).  The short rib had a lot of flavor though.  

We would definitely return based on the great service, bottomless mimosas, good atmosphere, and decent food."}
{"text":"Much like the desert in which Scottsdale sits, the local food scene feels desolate of inspiring choices. Where's a foodie to go?  

Local Bistro offers up a little break from the routine. The place is ambient, walls lined with wine and a chalkboard of specials. I gotta love a place which serves up burrata as an app. Between the two of us, it was enough as an entree. But then came his black linguini w/seafood (aka squid ink pasta) and my arugula salad. The portions were HUGE! Not that I'm complaining, but since we were staying at a hotel, we couldn't really tote our leftovers. 

Between the two of us, it would've been easier to split an app and entree. 
Definitely get the Burrata app and Black Linguini pasta!"}
{"text":"I would never return here.  Waiter slowly explains the ENTIRE menu, as if we are kindergarten students who can't read or understand a menu without assistance, and the Chilean Sea Bass is the worst I've had (for 30 bucks). Pan fried and dry; I would rather have had a McD Filet-o-Fish. The final straw was when I was the only person (party of 4) to order dessert, and the WAITER decides to bring plates and silverware for everyone, so HE decided I was sharing my dessert with everyone.  Not for him to offer/decide.  Bad food, annoying service."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in North Scottsdale- everything I've tried is delicious. The pizza is surprisingly amazing (wouldn't think to come here just for pizza but we do!) also love the Mussels Dijonaise & Rigatoni Alla Vodka. Definitely worth checking this place out!"}
{"text":"Took my friend for her birthday. There were 7 of us and the service was really great! I had the roasted chicken and it was delicious. Enough to take home for lunch the next day. Although I saw a cheeseburger go by and it looked yummy. Maybe next time. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"We ended up dining here because the restaurant had lots of positive reviews on Open Table - surprisingly more reviews on there than on Yelp.

Great food! I highly recommend the Seafood Linguine. 

The biggest drawback of this place is that it is LOUD. Definitely not a good date place unless you really don't want to talk to whoever you're with.

The tables are kind of close to each other too, so we heard all of the conversations around us, especially since everyone had to yell to communicate."}
{"text":"The sunday brunch is absolutely awesome! I wish they had it here on saturday as well, but I'm happy with one day a week at this quality!

I got the brunch burger which is ridiculous! We also tried some of the scrambles which were also really good!

Bottomless mimosa, so i mean, how do you really go wrong with that! Overall, I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch, which was fabulous. Grilled cheese sandwich with house made tomato soup, Cesar salad that was nice. Lots of available tables, and they tried to sit us a table for two which are so SMALL, I don't know how two people could have drinks and a main course. We enjoyed the lunch that we went back for dinner. At dinner, the place is LOUD. We were told it would be 15- 30 minutes. While we waited, we saw 5 - 6 open tables, which we assumed were for reservation. When we were finally seated after 30 minutes there still 5 -6 open tables. Strange! Our dinner was very good."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here last night and we love the new design. The food was delicious and our waiter Jonathan was wonderful.
However, our gripe with this place was our seating arrangements. We had reservations for two but were squeezed uncomfortably on the side between two larger parties. This was extremely stressful, as we felt part of another party. To make matters worse, there were three tables right behind us that were empty for at least 45 minutes. It was clear that less priority is given to couples then to larger parties."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic and great for the winter. Everything was very hearty and I recommend the seafood linguine. The service left something to be desired but overall it was very good. I will definitely come back soon."}
{"text":"I was visiting my parents in Scottsdale over the weekend and my father made reservations at the Local Bistro for dinner.  Both my parents are older and my Mom, in particular, has difficulty hearing in crowded rooms so when my father called to make the reservation he specifically asked that we would like to be seated outside since the restaurant is loud and it is difficult to hear one another in the crowded, noisy dining room.  He talked to the manager when he made the reservation and was assured that everything would be fine.  When we got to the restaurant, we were informed by the hostess that they did not take reservations for the patio.  She quickly called the \"manager\".  The restaurant was crowded and horrifically noisy.  The manager came over, mentioned that he did remember talking to my father but denied ever having said the we could sit on the patio.  We were informed that the patio is first come/first serve.  Instead of apologizing or trying to figure out a way to seat us on the patio the manager very rudely said that the conversation never happened and basically we were out of luck,  We left.  I happen to be in the restaurant business and I was pretty shocked at the abrupt, brusque and rude way my parents were treated.  Needless to say, we will never go there again.  I should not have to remind you that when people are so shabbily treated they tend to tell all of their friends, their children and their families.
I can only say to you that you should enjoy the crowds right now, but every dog has their day.  I have every confidence that the rude behavior, snotty attitude and failure to try to observe the most basic rules of customer service will catch up to your establishment.  It is not like you are the only restaurant in Scottsdale, or even in your shopping center for that matter."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I love this place.  We love the atmosphere and the food is great.  The spicy seafood pasta is excellent and the simple pasta bolognese is my favorite.  They staff is very knowledgeable about the menu and friendly."}
{"text":"All I can say is EXCELLENT service, food, and best of all our server Adrianna.   She recommended the appetizer Drunken Bread with prosciutto, and for dinner the red fish and spaghetti and smoked meat balls, and dessert was the expression creme brûlée. 

All the dishes showed the creativity of the chef and his crew.  

I would recommend this establishment to all.  

Thanks for a great evening."}
{"text":"This review is only for their brunch experience, which is OUTSTANDING. You can't find a better place.

We found the place on Yelp and were drawn by the promise of $12 bottomless mimosas (1 cent per refill) and a carefully-curated menu with healthy options. Each time we've gone (twice alone, once with friends), our mimosas were never less than half-full, and mostly champagne. The food is consistently outstanding, though my boyfriend didn't enjoy the peanut-butter themed item he had one time-- too rich. I adore the omelets, potatoes, and sausages. The enchilada stack was great, though a lot to handle!

Another thing that stands out is the service. The hostesses are always friendly, welcoming, and seat us promptly. There's never a wait. Our servers are wonderful too, checking up on us just enough. They never cut into conversation but always seem to appear at the most convenient time.

I love the atmosphere; always a comfortable temperature, classy interior, and spotlessly clean. Tables are bussed immediately after guests leave the restaurant. The bar looks fun for a game day, though we've never sat there. Even with the TVs on, the acoustics in the room must be good, because it's never noisy. There's a gentle hum of conversation, but that's it.

Prices are absolutely reasonable.

Local Bistro, keep up the great work! We love you and we will be back whenever we want brunch."}
{"text":"Delicious.  Great atmosphere.  Scottsdale prices, but that's to be expected in Scottsdale.  :)

I hear they have a great weekend brunch with bottomless fresh-squeed OJ mimosas!  Yummy!"}
{"text":"Wow! I can't believe I haven't been here sooner. Great atmosphere and the food was amazing.  Service was top notch. The shrimp risotto was outstanding and the penne ala vodka was scrumptious. We'll definitely be back...especially since the appetizer called Drunk Bread, which involves soaking bread in white wine, sounds fascinating and yummy!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a new place to go for a nicer meal and looked to Yelp for some help. If it's 4 stars, it's worth a try!

Great atmosphere, loved the vibe! Service was very good and attentive!

My husband has a hard time not ordering Chicken Parm and I'm the same with Filet. Both of us ordered mashed potatoes as a side and neither of us were disappointed. The fresh bread was good (I love fresh bread), but I can't believe I'm saying this...it was a bit salty. Very edible, just a bit too salty.

Great experience and great food, we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place has outstanding kitchen, bit they lack the ability to personalize your food, the way we are used to be pampered by Starbucks.

This place does NOT OFFER side salad (fries, potatoes, or fruit salad) NOR draft beers.... I bit of \"APPLE INC\" mentality...my way OR GTFO!

For being a pretentious place..., service and costumer feedback seems to be INCONSEQUENTIAL and inimportant  to the service personnel.

-1  stat for Substandard service
-1 star  for not offering draft beer"}
{"text":"Holy delicious, it doesn't get any better than this. The BF and I eat here for lunch routinely on the weekends and it's always amazing. Order the prosciutto sandwich; it comes with a soft Italian cheese we couldn't pronounce that melts in your mouth and a delicious fig jam. I could eat here daily."}
{"text":"The ambiance was fantastic and service incredible. We went for Sunday brunch, which is hard to find in Arizona without going to one of the resorts and paying $25 pp.  

We both had eggs benedict (fiorentina and california, $12), which was perfect - the sauce has a peppery bite and it comes with fresh fruit and herbed potatoes.  My husband tried the house-made sausage and loved it.  We didn't take advantage of the bottomless mimosas and bloody mary's ($12), but next time we will for sure!

The owner personally came to our table to say thank you for dining with them and have us free panna cotta (the best I've had in the states, normally $7).  

We will definitely try it again."}
{"text":"We have been to this local bistro 3 or 4 times since Central Bistro was sold to another company... Unfortunately, as much as we love the food, the service has not been up to par on our expectations. On each visit, it either takes a long time to get served or to receive our drinks after our order has been taken. This time, today, we came in and it was absolutely beautiful outside, but the doors were closed... We asked if they would open them so we can enjoy the beautiful weather while still sitting on the edge of the patio inside. They said that they would not open them because it was the general manager's order to keep it shut....last time I checked, it's the customer's request and needs that should be tended to, not the gm's. We know this is not any of the waitress' or waiters' fault, but this just isn't good management..."}
{"text":"From the moment we walked into Local Bistro, we knew we were going to have a great night. There is an energy in the restaurant that makes one feel at home. The menu is varied and each item we tried was wonderful. A great deal of thought has gone into to the Italian inspired dishes. The wine list is extensive and reasonably priced. One must splurge for the Drunken Bread appetizer. It is worth the calories!! It consists of a very thick slice of Italian bread that has been covered in a wine and gruyere sauce and baked. Amazing!  Other winners were the seafood linguini and veal chop. The pizzas also looked delicious.  Desserts were wonderful, too. Two home made ice cream sandwiches with sides of fudge and caramel dipping sauce was a home run.
A very friendly establishment that we will go back to on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Did a late night dinner here on a business trip.  Very much standard fare.  Nothing special, but no real regrets.  Would not go out of my way to return, but no big complaints either."}
{"text":"Wow! A superb choice for our valentines day! We had no reservation so they told us first come first serve at the bar and lounge. The lounge was awesome! Great couches and ambiance. Our server Deanna was awesome! Great recommendations and omg that drunk bread was a winner as well as the cream brûlée. We had the wild mushroom risotto and the roasted chicken (tasty Brussel sprouts). Very good! Loved the pear cocktail! We'll be putting this place on our list next time we visit. :)"}
{"text":"So, here is the scoop. I used to really enjoy Local Bistro and had recommended it to several friends. The service was good, the food was good, and all around I considered it a good value. The last 3 times I have been there I have been turned off by several things. First, one of the waiters has a very elitist air about himself. Not very accommodating at all, and not a friendly person...kind of the type of experience where you feel like you are bothering him by coming into the restaurant and ordering food??? Strange...if you do not like your job, go and get another one but don't make it my problem. I am not sure of his name, however he is a totally bald guy with a beard and can have quite an attitude at times. We have had the experience twice now. That being said we have also had some very nice waitstaff attend to us, but lately not the case.  I also find them to be quite inflexible in terms of their menu items. We are usually dinner clients but have also gone there for lunch at times. There always seems to be an issue with ordering....sorry we don't have mashed potatoes until 5pm...Oh sorry we can't do that for you right now because we have a light staff at this time....so many excuses to not provide service. I do like their skirt steak, and the portion was quite nice. Last few times I ordered it the portion was almost 50% smaller, same price.  I decided no more at this place...bad service a couple of times, smaller portions, unfriendly kitchen, that is enough for me not to go back. Well it has been a year since my last visit and we were thinking of a place to go. My wife asked me if I would try Local Bistro one more time since they have apparently remodeled. I told her I would give it a try.  We went at 2:30pm on a Saturday afternoon, 11/14/15 to be precise. Low and behold upon entering into the restaurant I spotted my favorite bald and bearded waiter. He was working behind the bar this time and not waiting tables...Thank God! When we sat down at 2:30pm we were handed a brunch menu which apparently is new since our last visit, maybe a part of the new remodel, menu and restaurant as well.  I am sorry, but brunch at 2:30pm is not what we were looking for. Eggs Benedict at that time? I asked them if they could offer us something else as my son and wife did not want to eat breakfast food at this hour. I was told we would have to come back after 3pm if we wanted to dinner menu. We got up and left, now for the final time as we will never go back. Yes, I understand they have the right to manage their restaurant as they please, but I also have the right to not return. Local Bistro always had good food, no argument there.... however their attention to the client has been somewhat snobbish and their inflexibility in regards to trying to satisfy a customer in my book is unacceptable. You can read my other many reviews and you will see that I am not a nit-pick. I like good food, do not typically ask anyone to go out of their way for me, most of the time eat right off the menu with no special orders. For some reason we always have an issue at Local Bistro. This time my wife, who is the nicest person alive, swore she would never step foot in there again.  Sorry Local Bistro....maybe you should touch base with some of your arrogant staff, and also make your customer more of a priority instead of letting them walk out of your restaurant w/out a care."}
{"text":"I am in love with this place! GREAT menu, atmosphere and service. Always a buzz whenever I go in. Hands down one of my favorites for life."}
{"text":"High end and very delicious.  The salads feature outstanding greens and crisp options... I have also had the burger here.  Strong!"}
{"text":"When I heard that Andrea Volpi was opening Local Bistro, I had high hopes for the restaurant and was even more excited that it is located so close to our home.  Chef Volpi took over the kitchen at Taggia at the FireSky Resort following Claudio Uriuoli's departure just months after we were married there.  We'd always found the food at Taggia to be excellent and expected Local Bistro to be on par with what we knew of Chef Volpi's prior cooking.  While we did have a reasonably good dinner at Local Bistro on one occasion, our subsequent visits have not proven as favorable.

The first time we dined at Local Bistro, I ordered the risotto primavera and my husband had the tagliatelle with wild mushrooms.  Both dishes were delicious and the fresh pasta in my husband's entree was excellent.  We were pleased with the meal and looked forward to coming back.  Several months later, we were with a group of people for Sunday brunch and our opinion made a 180 degree shift after the food and drinks that we were served.  They offered bottomless bloody marys and mimosas for $10 (now $12) and started out with a couple of bloody marys, which we requested to be made extra spicy.  The first round was decent, not the best I've ever had, but worthy enough to warrant ordering another. The second one, however, tasted entirely different and had no spice whatsoever.  At that point, I switched to a mimosa which was a nothing more than a champagne glass full of orange juice with next to no champagne, and thus, no effervescence.  As for the food, I ordered the calzone which was filled with scrambled eggs, chorizo, and fontina with a side of marinara sauce and my husband ordered the egg panini, which was described as scrambled eggs, fontina, and herb butter on homemade focaccia.  When our food arrived, my calzone was lackluster at best, having some less than exciting scrambled eggs and sausage encased in a thick and dry calzone crust.  The side of marinara was the only thing that made any of it edible.  My husband's \"panini\" turned out to be some scrambled eggs (not even well seasoned scrambled eggs) sandwiched between two incredibly thick slices of focaccia bread.  There was no sign of the sandwich having actually been pressed into a panini style and the overwhelming flavor and texture was nothing more than that of the gargantuan bread overload.  I knew that he was hungry when we got there and could tell that he was so dissatisfied with his meal that I offered to switch plates with him halfway through.  I only made it through a few bites of the bread before I gave up and singed that sandwich off as being unworthy of the effort that it would take my jaws to chew it.

We stopped in again for an appetizer at the bar and ordered the \"trio house dip\" which was described on the menu as piquillo romanesco, garden pesto, tapenade, and grilled flat bread.  None of the three dips had any positive qualities to them whatsoever.  In fact, I would rather have simply walked across the parking lot to the Fry's grocery store, purchased some store-bought hummus and eaten that instead.  The tapenade contained such an excessive amount of salt that no other flavors were discernible and the piquillo romanesco was nothing more than a flavorless red goo covered in olive oil.  The pesto was the best (and I use that term loosely here) of the three and was still so heavily seeped in oil that most of it slid off the flatbread.  The flatbread itself had a strange, carbon-like flavor, on the order of what I could only imagine a flatbread would taste like if I used it to clean the charred remnants from the grating of my gas grill prior to firing it up for the next meal.

The wine list is nothing remarkable and for a place that bills itself as an Italian bistro, it is strangely populated by California wines with few if any Italian selections available.  Also worth noting is that during one visit, while seated at the bar, we noticed one of the young, male bartenders having a bit of difficulty in mixing their specialty martinis. I'm guessing that he was fairly inexperienced because he never managed to make a drink that was more than 2/3 full.  One drink was no more than half full and he bent down and observed the level, then set it on the bar for the server to take to a table.  The drink was returned moments later due to its low level and he remedied the problem by adding more soda to the glass.  While it was a comical situation to watch, given the fact that drinks are on the order of $10, I can't imagine that someone would be satisfied with a weak, soda water martini when they've ordered something that is supposed to be a \"specialty drink\".  Overall, I think we may venture in for a glass of wine or perhaps a pasta dish, but I think we'll stick to safe selections and not wander too far off the beaten culinary path at Local Bistro as our past experiences seem to indicate the likelihood of wandering into the jungle and falling into a culinary lion's pit there."}
{"text":"Great spot for anytime dinner! Fab wine and cocktail list. Good spot to take kids. A little noisy but not bad. Great food, I had the beef carpaccio,really good!  Dessert was tiramisu, excellent!! We have been more than once and will go again. Love it."}
{"text":"We were here for a business luncheon, 12 people, and every single dish was excellent, our server did a great making sure all our orders (and we had lots who requested modifications) came out correct, quickly, and hot (or cold depending on what you ordered). 

I had the scallops with corn risotto and am still dreaming of it. I will be coming back every chance I get, whether for personal or business reasons. 

one thing though...it is spendy, be prepared to pay $25- $45 per person."}
{"text":"Looking for a fantastic BRUNCH ?  You will be delighted at the multiple choices!  I had the enchilada skillet - yum !  My friends had the Benedict!  Yes!  Crab? Avocado? Amazing!  Looking for a fantastic lunch? Stop here!  But the dinner menu?  Shut the front door!  Rigatoni rocks!  Parmesan chicken - I dream about! Everything about this menu is incredible. You can eat here for weeks and have something different and fabulous! Not to mention awesome energy and great atmosphere!  One of my most favorite places ever !"}
{"text":"I came here for with my Aunt, Cousin and Mom for dinner. We sat outside because it was too noisy inside. It wasn't too hot because of the misters. It was kinda dirty though. There were leaves on our plates and the placemats were pretty dirty. The silverware and napkins were nice and clean though. Service was good, our waitress was really nice.

 My Mom and I split the seafood squid ink linguine. To start we just had some bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. I liked the bread, I think it was focaccia. It was slightly crispy on the top and bottom and super soft in the middle. It was a little on the salty side though. Our entree came on separate plates, which was nice. It also came with a bowl to put our shells in. The seafood was really good and very fresh. The pasta was good too. The dish as a whole was a little under seasoned. It needed some flavor. My Mom really enjoyed it though. It was a pleasant dinner out on the patio."}
{"text":"Came on Saturday for brunch, only to learn brunch is only on Sundays...bummer!!  But, the place was great...it's very clean, trendy, has a great bar.  We ended up having a drink at the bar while we decided where to head to brunch; the bartender was awesome.  She made a suggestion for brunch and even gave one of my friends his drink on the house for his birthday!  And let's talk about these drinks; they were GREAT!!  I had the spicy peach margarita, a friend had the pear martini, another friend had the cucumber mule, and the last just a whiskey on ice.  All were DELICIOUS, though I did like my spicy margarita the most.  Would definitely recommend; I want to try the strawberry crostini next time...and the brunch on a Sunday, of course!  We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Need something a little lighter?  You must try the steak salad!  I was really excited that is not the traditional avocado or Thai flavor. Oh and wash it down with a frozen coke, only for the grown ups."}
{"text":"Since my last review, I've been to Local Bistro several more times.  Every time I go, the food is great and the service is even better.  We have yet to be disappointed in the overall experience. 

As far as food goes, I've had several of their entrees including the risotto and pasta.  Both were delish.  The pizza is also tasty as was the special my Husband had one evening.  Seriously, you cannot go wrong with this \"local\" gem!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here the past 2 Saturday's. I highly recommend making a reservation as the place gets packed. The bar area is kind of weird looking (in my opinion) - kind of sparse - and the biggest negative is that the tables are so close together. I could hear every word spoken at the tables on either side of us. As for the menu... the bread they give you is delightful, Baby Beets - yum, I would order 2 of these as my entree. Kale Salad - super tasty, great dressing. My husband loved the pork chop. Skinny Margarita - not so great. If you're into Veev Acai, you may like it. Awesome wine list. The service the past 2 weekends has been fantastic and the timing of the courses is perfect. Love the modern decor - haven't had the chance to sit outside yet, but their patio is darling."}
{"text":"Just ate here for our anniversary for the first time.. It was really good. Service was great and we were greeted right when we walked in. We ordered the pork tenderloin which was really good and the steak frites was good as well. I would go for the pork tenderloin next time over the steak. Oh we also started off with drunk bread.. It was really good.. It does have wine in it and I can definitely taste it.
A guy also came to our table to ask us how are meal was and make sure we were happy and gave us the names of the managers just in case we had any feedback. We also got a dessert no charge because we were first time customers.. I have no idea what he said it was but it was delicious! I would totally recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Buccatini All'Amatriciana is a dish that cannot be perverted. Yes, they have the Calabrian chilis and San Marzano tomatoes correct. The rest is a mess. Why would a restaurant have pancetta instead of guanciale as the meat? Onions and garlic make great flavor, but we can't call it a genuine All'Amatriciana with those ingredients, can we? The only things you need are pasta, tomatoes (San Marzano), red pepper (Calabrian, preferably), Guanciale (the cured Jowls of a pig, which taste extremely more 'piggy' than a simple pancetta), a good pecorino romano (again, this dish is Roman), some fleur de sel, and possibly a grind of pepper. The onions, garlic, herbs, and pancetta make it a mockery of the original. When I pay 20 dollars for a dish with a name that reflects a classic Roman dish, I really hope to taste the genuine flavors the dish was meant to have. This is not that. I can cook a better version of any of the dishes offered here in my own kitchen for less than a quarter of the price.
My name is Stirling Peters."}
{"text":"Like everyone else we went for the drunk bread! It was definitely worth it...nothing beats cheese, bread, and wine, let alone all combined in to one. Delicious.

We also had the mushroom pizza which I'll admit sounded better than it was. It was still good and even better when dipped in their rosemary ranch dressing, but I can't say it was anything special. 

For a Thursday night the place was packed, which is always a good sign and I get why. It's a warm and inviting atmosphere with good food. I would definitely go back, especially to try the bottomless mimosas on the weekends!"}
{"text":"I went to Local Bistro on a double date with my boyfriend and his parents. They selected the restaurant stating that \"Local Bistro was their favorite!\" 

It's located inside a shopping center of sorts, but don't let that deter you. The restaurant is very upscale on the inside. It's not too large and it was fairly busy for a week night. Make a reservation.

The red wine was delicious. The server was attentive. The food was great from the pizza, to the salmon to the calamari.  The best dish was the truffle risotto. If you like truffle, even just a little bit - you've got to order it!

I will be definitely be back to Local Bistro."}
{"text":"Dined here recently, having their Local Burger. The burger was prepared perfectly, med-rare. The bun was excellent. However, the frites were terrible! Soggy, greasy and undercooked. What a disappointment. My companion had their diner special, Mac and Cheese with salmon, which was very good. Not too rich, but, well balanced. It could have used a small salad side included, which would have been nice without ordering a ala carte salad. The wine selection is excellent, broad and varied. Service was slow, considering they were not very busy. We would definitely return, however, it would not be a destination restaurant to drive to."}
{"text":"OMG. Eaten here many times. Great. Drunk Bread a must app. Wine food all great. Service is professional and spot on. Don't miss this spot. Bar is a great place to hang before dinner....or eat at the bar with new friends.

Edit:  crab cakes!!!  Corn and shrimp or crab chowder. Whew!!!  Yew whole menu is great....we did apps, salad, and soup tonight."}
{"text":"All day happy hour Monday in the bar area was legit. Tried several different drinks. All of them were delicious. They use luxardo cherries, not cheap maraschinos. Only had  appetizers... drunk bread with added prosciutto was rich and cheesy but yummy. Eggplant was awesome, perfectly cooked, and shrimp was very flavorful. Cheap and scrumptious dinner. Regular menu looked pretty pricy but some of the dishes might be worth the splurge. Will definitely be back. Great place."}
{"text":"I've been to Local dozens of times, but today stands out as one of the best service experiences I've had, not only at Local, but any place in recent months. They have it down!  Great place for good originally styled food and wine."}
{"text":"I wanted to try something new so I went on local dines and found a deal for Local Bistro. The good news is that I would have been happy here even without the deal but it is always nice to have one to try a new place! Amazing selection of wines. The drunken bread was my favorite part. It was very tasty and I will go back just to have it again! The pizza was good, a little on the salty side for my taste but decent. The manhattan clam chowda was really good as well. I really liked the environment and the patio looked really nice for this fall. Great service as well."}
{"text":"We arrived with a reservation and table was not our favorite spot, Brandon changed our table, happily, we loved our time there I had some friends visiting Scottsdale and they were thoroughly impressed, Eric our Server was very efficient and knowledgeable about menu. Brandon checked in on us regularly to make sure everything was perfect. Our meals were fantastic, the chefs that night did a first class job of preparing everything to perfection. 
Atmosphere was buzzing. We loved everything about the restaurant. Thanks for a memorable evening.

{"text":"Local was the first exceptional culinary experiences my hubby and I shared in AZ.  Situated right near our condo, Bistro offered consistently good service and food.  After a couple of visits, we officially made it our \"go to\" place for happy hour and brunch.

But our last two visits were disappointing.  The food appears to be on a downward trajectory:  salty and hastily prepared.

The steak tartare shrunk from a hearty, delicious \"eyes rolling back\" portion to a spoonful of tartare upon which many potatoes sticks are topped.  The Caesar salad, another one of my favorites, has become \"hit or miss\", sometimes dressed and other times a buck-naked bunch of romaine.  And the pizza Margherita was both salty and skimpy, an intolerable combination.  

On a positive note, unlimited bloody Mary's and mimosas saved our most recent brunch experience, as the food again, was not up to their usual high standard.

I write this review in part because I'm sad.  And while I've brought this unfortunate demise to the attention of management, there's been no improvement...  Perhaps there's a new chef who isn't executing the vision and excellence of his/her predecessor?  Or has this restaurant peaked?  

I, for one, may never find out."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! The staff was so helpful and courteous it really made our night special.  We had a group of 7 people so we got a good mix of everything, and let's just say no bad reviews all around.  See pictures for a few meals we had.  Must try, you won't regret!"}
{"text":"Over the top loud compounded by drunken idiots shouting across the restaurant.  Once notified, manager unable to control situation but did have time to be unapologetic to my complaint.  As to food, highly touted salmon was just ok; shaved vegetables piled three inches on top served no purpose! Pasta entree was very good, however.. Sit outside if you want to have a conversation!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to give Local Bistro a try after seeing the good reviews on Yelp. We were both happy with the food, service and atmosphere and will be coming back. The cuisine is an odd mish-mash of French and Italian, but that's their thing, and it works. I had the Steak Frites, and my wife had the Pork Tenderloin. Both were delicious."}
{"text":"Incredibly delicious menu, many choices from gourmet burgers to seafood, pasta and salads.  Something for everyone. Extensive wine list & signature cocktails.  Exceptional atmosphere, indoor outdoor seating.  Highly recommend whether a special occasion or just looking for a great place to dine and socialize!"}
{"text":"Never thought a place with such an unimaginative name could be that good. But it's reasonably close by, so we decided to give it a try when we got a LocalDines coupon. Turns out, both service and chow are quite good! We rolled in early, without a reservation, and were able to snag a table on the patio -- perfect weather made that an especially good choice because it was already pretty loud inside. Menu is standard bistro fare -- we would have like to see more creativity, but what they do, they do well and they were very good sports about accommodating hubby's special requests. It's on our list!"}
{"text":"Went to local bistro for Easter brunch, and the food, and service were great from start to finish. They have a diverse brunch menu and my group enjoyed eggs benedict, pizza, and the hamburger. The ingredients on everything tasted fresh, and everyone walked away satisfied from the meal. They have a bottomless mimosa deal during brunch, and our waitress kept them flowing and plentiful, which was extremely appreciated. There were even little details like allowing us to pick which citrus fruit we wanted in our water. This restaurant clearly cares about their customers, and the quality of their food. I will be back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"4.5 Stars All Day Long. And who wouldn't want a Spiced Calvados Sidecar to help kickstart the holidays? I know I did. Although contrary to the azcentral article (http://tinyurl.com/2fy6m5w) \"Best holiday drinks around the Northeast Valley\", the rim was not frozen and in fact, the bartender had no idea what I was talking about when I asked for the cocktail. But in all fairness, they've been open just over a week. After a few minutes of asking around - she quickly corrected herself and not only apologized but bought my first drink! Whew! I knew I had done my homework. And the drink was amazing.

We went for the full dining experience at Local Bistro. Started out with the Beef Carpaccio which was topped with arugula, parmiggiano, fried caper berries and drizzled with truffle oil. First time EVER even hearing about a caperberry. Basically, \"capers\" are young buds of the caper bush. If they grow large enough, they become caperberries which when fried, reminded me of okra, with a hint of tartness like olives, larger pearl like seeds...inside with a slight sticky texture. Interesting! I love parmigiano so that was a no brainer but the arugula was fresh, delicious, and paired nicely with the carpaccio.

For an entree - how about some pan seared sea bass with seasonal veggies topped with a vanilla beurre blanc? Killer. Added a side of Spinach which was sauteed in olive oil with garlic and granada padano...the infamous italian cheese that is similar to parmiggiano with a few different distinct qualities. Great flavor, prepared nicely. Well done and priced at $24.

I couldn't leave without trying dessert. They had I \"I want them all\" for $40 which would give you all the desserts...but I chose from the list the most unique which happened to be the Nutella Calzone. It was wood-fired, stuffed with nutella, served with berries and I think it was supposed to be topped with vanilla gelato, although ours was served without? And I don't remember the name of the cocktail but I had a dessert cocktail which included a biscotti liquor. Delish. Still my favorite was the spiced sidecar....well worth the venture up north.

It was completely out of my hood but I am determined to try all the 10 hot spots for unique holiday cocktails. If I'm ever in the area I'll definitely be back and I would highly recommend for anyone in the neighborhood. I'd be there often!!!"}
{"text":"My first time at LB.  Although my wife has enjoyed each of her previous visits.  Sunday brunch was busy with, what appeared to be, a full house.  And we really enjoyed the atmosphere and our fellow patrons.  Everyone appeared to be having a wonderful time on a beautiful morning.

Found the brunch menu to be traditional. Covering all the breakfast /lunch bases.  My wife had the Spanish Skillet and I the Eggs Benedict.   All in all, an OK meal.  My portion was very small and my wife's Skillet was sizable but short on everything except potatoes. We also found the service attentive albeit slow.  However, the waitstaff did a good job of keeping our  Mimosa and other drinks topped-off. Two meals arrived after several minutes; two others arrived several minutes later.

According to our guests our less-than-impressive effort was an exception.  We'll give it another try for dinner later in the Spring."}
{"text":"We dine here, maybe a couple of times a year, but they never fail to please.

The service is extraordinary. The servers are left to handle the customers, while other staff bus tables and perform food delivery. Servers do not hover, but always seem to be available, when needed.

Good cocktails. Affordable wines.

The pasta always arrives aldente. The steaks are cooked as requested. Some of the sides even out shine the mains.

This is a neighborhood gem."}
{"text":"Very nice, local restaurant, with tasty food. I find the waitstaff to be so nice and friendly every time. Sometimes the service is a little slow, but not typically. Now that the space has been remodeled, it is much nicer and can accommodate more people. However, this is not a place that I would take someone to have a great meal, but it is local and it is good."}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp for helping me to find this place. As good as the reviews were, it exceed my expectations. The service, food, atmosphere, and ambience were outstanding. Normally locals when the find a special place to dine, they keep the information to themselves, for fear of the tourists taking it over, but the rule should not apply here. Sam the floor manager was special, as was a new waitress name Erin.
We ate like we had not eaten for a week, but came home with another meal for tomorrow. It was a Wednesday night, but at 7:00 there were people waiting in line.
Naturally a newbie has to try the Drunk bread, but check out the menu on their website. Their calling card says  \"Pizza, Pasta, Steak, Wine\" which is a big understatement for this elegant restaurant in North Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I have been to many restaurants and have asked for lemon wedges to squeeze over my food. 98% percent of them bring thin lemon slices that will get you 2-3 drops, The ones that are used for your drink rim. This place not only gives you a lemon cut in half they put them in lemon seed filter baggies. Love this place already!"}
{"text":"The food has always been good and service by our waiter and the the manager Brandon was fantastic. The blonde hostess was extremely rude and snotty. On top of that she made us wait 30 minutes past our reservation time to be seated. When I asked how long it would be she said they were clearing the table in a condescending tone. 10 minutes after that I went up there again and basically had to force her to seat us. She needs to be fired. Her attitude looks badly on everybody else that is working very hard to keep customers happy. She is the only reason I'm not giving a 5 star review."}
{"text":"This was my first trip to Local.  I was unimpressed.  My wife's potato soup tasted like raw flour.  The bread with cheese appetizer was OK but nothing special.  The pappardelle was nice.  My wifes risotto was not cooked properly (although tasty), some of the rice was still hard. It was obvious the exec chef was not in the house.   Now when I ask for Iced I expect iced tea not funky tea.  The wait staff needs to let people know what kind it is.  The wait staff was very good.   One of the wines Dona Paula Estate Malbec from Argentina was listed for $69. It can be found at Costco for +-$12.  Now that is an outrageous markup.  Even wine.com has it for $14.99.  Remember restaurants buy it for wholesale which was most likely +-$11.00   Now this is gauging    (+-620% markup) to the max.   Now dont get me wrong i have paid $400 for a bottle of wine in a 4* restaurant ( Sanctuary, Bourbon Steak, Jean George NYC, Valentino )  but then again I know what I am buying .  ALSO being a wine guy I noticed some of the 
wine was 18 feet off the floor, now in AZ this is a NO NO. Wine spoils at 80 degrees.

BOTTOM LINE: The food got barely a 3* only because of the pappardelle (was very good), the risotto, is difficult to cook quickly (a Pass), the potato soup ( someone needs training) the wine gouging go ZERO stars I was very generous with the 2 stars overall, mainly because of the wine scenario.  

Will I go back? maybe,  because of some of the other recommendations on YELP.  the menu is interesting but definitely not at lunch.  Management needs to do some soul searching teach  better techniques, teach the cook staff and make adjustments."}
{"text":"Update - after we went back!  

Went back to Local Bistro with some friends because I really want to love this place. And now I do! Their wine list is seriously the best I have seen in the valley. The four of us managed to polish off two different wines (one with appetizers and one with dinner) during our 2 hour visit. First and foremost we made sure it was okay to stay that long (it was a week night and in the summer so we were cool).

To start we shared roasted beets and calimari but I couldn't eat the calimari because I am gluten free. For dinner I had an amazing caesar salad with salmon that was so good I could eat it every day! One other of us had the chicken and wild mushrooms and two had the special fish of the day. All the dishes were amazing (according to everyone's mmmmm'ing) and our service was fabulous! Because it was summer, we even had a chance to banter with our server and he shared his background with us, which just made our outing even more fun! 

So glad we went back here! This place is on our short list of favorites in the east valley! You really gotta go....great wine...super freshly prepared food....gorgeous atmosphere...it's a winner!!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what is preventing me from giving it 5 stars, but I probably should.

Great restaurant, great service, great food, great wine, great ambiance.  I went here with a colleague based on Yelp reviews and were not disappointed!  We had a fantastic meal and the service was outstanding. 

The noise level was a little high, but I'm guessing that is due to the fact that it was very, very busy and it has high ceilings that most likely do not allow for any noise absorption.

Overall, I give it two thumbs up and will definitely go back next time I'm in town/in the area."}
{"text":"Local bistro in Scottsdale was a nice welcoming change to your franchise Italian Restuarant. It is $$ on the prices but you get good service and wonderful meals. 

My wife ordered the French Onion soup. It had a wonderful balance of broth and onions as well as a heaping layer of gruyere cheese which toppled over edges of the bowl. Great way to enjoy some cheesy goodness. Croutons were a nice addition.  - -4 stars 

Also, if you don't a want the large portion of the steak and salad, get the side salad and add the sirloin steak (additional cost) and you have a balance meal and full filling meal with the French Onion Soup. - Steak comes made to order so make sure the server knows how you like your steak. 3 1/2 stars.

I had the TAGLIATELLE Bolognese sauce (beef, veal and pork). It was wonderful. The three meats had a nice balance. You can taste the meat but it's not over powering the other meats. The deep red tomato sauce was perfect and the hand made noodles were wide and al dente. Perfectly cooked and the noodles soaked up the sauce. - 5 stars

Dessert was the \"espresso\". Homemade Tiramisu layered in dish that can shared by two people or if you are \"glutton\" for punishment, eaten by one. Dessert was more custard like and we expected a more traditional tiramisu. It was little too sweet and almost too creamy custard like. Yummy but only 3 1/2 stars.

Note: Noodles are gluten free

Service - 4 stars
Our server was attentive but at times we had to wait a little bit longer to ask for something. Not his fault because we went on a Thursday and the NBA Finals were on at the bar - so it was really busy. He did tell us the kitchen was \"backed up\" so it might take a little bit longer for our food.  Server was knowledgeable about the menu and the drinks (nice wine and liquor selection).  

Not all wines are single servings so the selection was limited. Glass servings are marked as \"red\".  Whiskey selections were nice.

Beer selection, not so much.

Environment:

We thought 7:30 was a good time but it was not due to NBA Finals.  The inside of the Restuarant was loud and sound echoed so we opted to sit outside. I would definitely recommend that option. Water misters were on and it felt cooler and quiet. A better environment to enjoy the company and meal.  Ambience was a little bit dark with the lighting but the talks trees and plants felt like you were in a secluded garden. - 5 stars for the outside garden area and 3 stars for inside area (has an echo effect).


No pictures this time but check their menu. http://localbistroaz.com/


Overall - 4 stars -"}
{"text":"I am giving 2 stars not necessarily for the food, because the mussels were amazing and I highly recommend the Spanish risotto as well.  the reason I am writing is because my dining guest got FOOD POISONING from the Black Linguine Pasta with seafood.. (I assume it was squid ink pasta?) Either way, this wasn't just 24 hours of hell, but it has continued for 2 days now.... cannot keep anything down, doctor required!  I wrote Local Bistro to tell them about the possible dangers with Friday (1-20) dinner, but I never even heard a response back with shows lack of care and overall no concern for their guests...

We cannot even go there anymore because of this incident.... sadly they didn't even say \"I am sorry\""}
{"text":"We ate here in the summer of 17 and it was very good.  Unfortunately, the only thing good about our experience last night 12/28 was the service, beer and gelato.  I was hoping to show my mother a great dining experience however her sea bass was over cooked and had that nasty fishy smell (obviously was past its prime).  The steak in my salad was chewy and full of gristles. My wife who never complains commented that her chicken parm was dry and not as good as before.  Perhaps the chef or manager changed but its unlikely that we will be back.

{"text":"We have been twice and both times we were impressed. The staff is very friendly and professional. They are clearly very well trained. Downside, happy hour is only at the bar. Upside, everything we have tried was really good. They have this pasta with corn in it, and it is awesome!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is amazing. Service is great. So glad to have another great place in Grayhawk.  I love that the sandwiches are served on a cutting board..something unique, and fun.  I ordered take-out one day, I was expecting the normal \"take out\" type presentation.  Cold food, warm salad...you know.  I was blown away!!  I opened my food, and aside from the cutting board, I felt like I had been served in the restaurant.  I have not had anything there that I wouldn't order again...wonderful food, great service...all around great!!  One of my new favorites!"}

The wine selection is phenomenal with faves such as Prisoner, Justin, Caymus and A to Z.  Bottles are very reasonably priced too!
 

Good spot for HH, lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere!  Shrimp Santa Lucia and Steak Frites!  If you are a a crab cake snob then you must order their crab cake! A presentation of heaven and the added avocado is a nice surprise!"}
{"text":"This review is based off of my 2 visits to this establishment. Once during lunch and once yesterday for brunch. 

During my first visit, it was a pretty empty restaurant which was a bit shocking to me because I thought there would be a lunch rush. There may have been a few other tables during our time there. Our server was a bit of a bore - no warm welcome, no smiles, not a bit friendly. He had the personality of a guard at Buckingham Palace. During that visit, I ordered the Day Boat Scallop risotto. It was nicely plated and pretty good but not a dish I would need to order again. For desserts, we had the zeppoli and tiramisu. 

I was intrigued by the unlimited mimosas on the online menu so I convinced my friends to come here for their birthday brunch. By the way, while mimosas, bloody marys and moscow mules are \"unlimited,\" you are charged one cent per refill and I believe the moscow mules have a limit of 3. So it technically isn't unlimited.

In honor of Cinco de Mayo weekend, I chose the Drunken Enchiladas as my meal. It cam recommended by our server. I thought it was just okay so if we come back, I'll have to try something else. My fiance went with the short rib omelette and seemed to enjoy it. 

One of the birthday girls decided on the Wild Mushroom Fritatta and I managed to get a bite of it. That was what I should have ordered. 

Not sure if the server forgot or if they don't do anything but there weren't any birthday desserts offered. Somewhat disappointing because this restaurant was my suggestion for their birthday brunch.

For unlimited mimosas for 2, short rib omelette, and the drunken enchiladas, our total came out to be $59.37 + tip. Our server was really nice this time and the live music was fun so it made this visit much more enjoyable."}
{"text":"Dishes are hit or miss. To much hype for nothing special. Tons O butter anyone? Generic food at a so so price. I'll pass."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots. Place looks great, staff is great.
Everything was delicious....the drinks...the wine...saffron linguini...carpaccio...walnut chocolate cake is to die for, rich, creamy, decadent! All except the cream that came with the cake: a horrible, unsweetened, deflated, mushy thingy that doesn't belong anywhere near my plate. Please give me airy, sweet, homemade whipped cream!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were visting from NoVA and found this great place after having arrived very late into PHX airport.  Very very good wine list (by the glass as well!). I had the risotto with smoked duck breast - one of the best risotto's I have ever had! My wife tried the homemade carbonara spaghetti - outstanding as she is a pasta connoisseur!
This place is worth a special trip or going out of your way."}
{"text":"Amazing birthday dinner on Friday night for my husband!

Start to finish. And what a finish (see pics ) with a talented very inherently kind genuine and professional server Scott! As we understood from our hostess it was his first night. Congrats Scott on first class service. We never would have known. He is a keeper!!! 

Him being new and seasoned patrons, how amazing was it he introduced us to a great new wine selection that we both enjoyed. Also ensured my cocktails had my request of sliced orange every time (cough cough-YES! more than one)  it was a celebration people

I decided to do a different meal this night from what I always choose. The chicken parmigiana defies imagination or any salad, handmade burrata YUM!! Tuna tartare  calamari fritti, or angel hair pomodoro.
Craving a steak but didn't want a heavy stomach- Steak frites was the answer, it is AlWAYS so consistently good simple yet perfect and left me satisfied. 

My husband tried and true favorites.... the arugula salad which is SO much more than the title suggests. TRY IT! Gorgeous and delicious, 
along with his favorite dinner of all time, Tagliatelle Bolognese. He disappoints himself if we go elsewhere for dinner, ordering this plate, thinking he is at bistro, with their version the best we have experienced. 

Their panna cottta desert special in indeed special. Light seemingly simple but always a perfect custard. Birthday treats sent from kitchen were fresh small glasses of limoncello. I forgot how good they make it!! Wow! Like visiting my Italian friends back east. 
Surprise Zeppoli. Remind me of home, my Italian neighbor, neighborhood Italian feasts in the streets with knock your socks of fresh food . 
Listen if warm pillows of fresh dough lightly fried sprinkled in sugar accompanied by special dipping sauces doesn't make a person happy there is no help for any of us.

We can't thank the team here enough for the great night.!!

Brandon!!!!!! our favorite manager, in town, is always present, talking with customers, bringing orders out, getting drinks to the right tables, discreetly checking in or stopping by for a longer hello if he can. I'm so impressed with his care and regard for us and all his customers. Thank you Brandon. You are wonderful. 
NOW it's my secret wish (that I share with the world wide internet ?) that when I come by I WON'T see you --as you will be off on a wonderful exciting tasty vacation to fill you right up for the busy season.  Dedication and passion needs time away for reflection ;) 

Much love and thanks~ lolita and dante"}
{"text":"Went tonight since the remodel and our dinner was excellent.  Rather than complain about our lost order, let me say that Dave Keyser, MGR, did everything possible to make things right.  The food was outstanding and the drinks were generous.

If being in the restaurant business was easy, everyone would be in it.  Tonight was \"one of those things\" that happen to EVERY restaurant.

The only thing a patron wants is to be acknowledged when things get delayed.  Tonight, I believe the management was sincerely sorry our order got 'delayed.'

Can;t wait to go back.  A great spot.
Larry"}
{"text":"Really nice space, friendly service, reasonable prices on food and wine and very good food.  It was also in close proximity to where I was staying.

While in town recently, I had the pleasure of eating here twice.  Both times, I had their arugula salad with roasted pear, goat cheese and Marcona almonds with a lemon oil dressing.  I also had their mussels and fried calamari.  Both of the sea creatures appetizers were very tasty and fresh."}
{"text":"Solid meal, great service, reasonable price, cool spot.  Very safe bet for a date or quiet dinner out."}
{"text":"Excellent food, wine, and service. The GM, Brandon, is a great host and makes fantastic recommendations. Nicole is one of our favorite servers and we have never been disappointed with any of our servers. The handmade burrata, first introduced to us by Brandon, is absolutely delightful and a must try."}
{"text":"My wife and I, whom live in Grayhawk, visited the Local Bistro last night.  We ordered the Caprese Salad, Beef Carpaccio, Steak Frites, and a Chicken Parmesan Cobb Salad.  Once we placed our order we were notified that the Caprese Salad was sold out.

**If you like thick, chewy roast beef, get the Beef Carpaccio.  I can't say enough bad things about it.

**If you want even chewier meat that is impossible to swallow, get the Steak Frites.

**If you want an unpalatable Chicken Parmesan Cobb Salad, this is definitely the place to go.

To further my anguish, Local Bistro does not have toothpicks, so you can't even get the chewy meat out of your teeth.

There were a few good points to the restaurant, the wait staff seemed friendly and the inside of the restaurant is clean and neat.

Unfortunately for Local Bistro, my $51.00 check was way over priced.  I don't mind paying a pretty penny for good food, but being that I chose not to eat my entire meal, I left hungry.  I feel that Local Bistro will have the same future as Eddie Chan's (who had way better food) which was the last restaurant that occupied that space.

If you feel like spending $50 on a meal for two people without drinks, there are many better options within a mile radius."}
{"text":"Hurry and change the name, LOCO BISTRO .... you must be crazy to wait for this food, the flavor of the seafood linguini was lost in the kitchen, also had the tuna tartare, drunk bread and calimari all of which are okay. maybe they should just serve  appetizers"}
{"text":"I've been here over five times and  haven't had a bad meal here. I highly recommend the vodka pasta and angel hair pomadoro. The service is great!  The bread they bring to the table is delicious. They also bring a variety of citrus for your water which is very refreshing!"}
{"text":"Yummy food, good crowd, nice happy hour, great outside patio and their menu is wonderful. Staff is excellent!"}
{"text":"Wow oh wow. Do I get a warm greeting when I walk in? Usually, no. I have yet to eat or drink something here that didn't amaze me. This is my 3rd time and the mussels dijonaise are the best mussels ever. I wanted a straw to drink up the rest of the sauce. Other notables: great wine list, house made limoncello, smoked salmon avocado toast, the burrata appetizer, the bleeping gnocchi (treat yo self!) and the super trendy decor. I wish I lived closer so it would be a cheap uber ride home. Do yourself a favor. Come here. Tell them I sent you. Haha."}
{"text":"Visiting from PA and was told this place was good.  They are lucky they are not in Pittsburgh or Savannah GA because the food was less than memorable. Their Wood fired pizza tasted very plain and certainly had no flavor of wood fire cooking. Bland sauce made us unable to finish it. Salad was drowned in dressing and again did not live up to the menu description. Service was very good but I would not go here again 
or recommend this food."}
{"text":"Very nice place, really liked the environment. The waiters were great. All the food was great, salmon is excellent! The bread that they serve in the beginning and the breadsticks were really hard, all our jaws were sore after trying to eat it. If it wasn't for the bread this would have been rated 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I'll start by saying we have visited local bistro many times over the past 5 years and this was by far our worst experience. We went for the Sunday brunch and everything started off well but our food was less than spectacular. Each of us had items on our plate that were not hot and our waiter seemed overwhelmed with the number of tables he had to work and missed a few opportunities to refill our drinks. The bloody marys were awful.  No flavor at all.  They must use a less than top of the line mix due to the bruch special. Had we not been so hungry and in such a rush we would have brought the problems to their attention which I know they would have corrected but we've always expected better food quality from Local. Will be back but hopefully this was just a one time hiccup."}
{"text":"I've recently been exploring this whole area north of the 101, as I recently moved nearby. I must say this has been one of the highlights of my culinary findings. My fiance and I went for dinner, and I returned with my parents a few days later. Both experiences were very good. 

For dinner, the music is fairly loud and almost has a nightclub feel to it. The crowd is certainly on the older side though, a lot of cougars and grey haired heads in the building. The food is excellent and massive in their portions without being overwhelming. We had a lot of leftovers the next day. The only item that I didn't love was the burrata dish. It tasted very good, but the burrata was hard as a rock, not the creamy, soft or squishy delight it should have been. The dish itself was tastey but it shouldn't be sold as burrata. The scallop risotto was incredible, as was the chicken and artichoke dish. 

For lunch, the vibe is much more relaxed and the club music wasn't blasting. I think I prefer this spot for lunch solely based upon this fact. The menu is much the same with a few more \"lunch\" items included: such as more sandwiches/salads. I had a salad this time and it was truly excellent, one of the best salads I've had in some time. 

The venue is very modern, large and airy feeling with great service from the staff. The price is very reasonable for what they offer as well."}
{"text":"I am usually not one to follow the masses, but I will agree with my fellow Yelpers on this spot. You really can't go wrong with a place when the instant you walk in, people are ushering in smiles and attention to accommodate your dining needs. The bar is a great spot to rest your bum but I wanted to soak up the beautiful monsoon season on the patio. Blame the moscow mule because I cannot recall my server's name, but Miss New Jersey was someone I seriously could kidnap to go explore the menu with! Personable, attentive but never intrusive and certainly she has great taste in food.

I started with the burrata appetizer and I never realized how cheese and peaches could take your smile to such heights. The steak salad is incredible generous with the meat portion, and I was an appreciative audience! I loved how they did use peaches to make the salad refreshing. And finally, you cannot eat here without having the white chocolate bread pudding. To die for. It is now my second favorite version next to red velvet bread pudding."}
{"text":"Returned for Dinner and had a delicious meal. Both the hostess and server went out of their way to accommodate us. This time was an absolute five star experience."}
{"text":"The local cheeseburger on the menu was good. Went for late Sunday brunch (1:30pm) with a girlfriend looking for a pleasant friendly outing. Unfortunately, our table was next to a foursome that were less than pleasant. They were drunk when we got there and we're still being obnoxious when we left. (Arguing and disputing and trying to involve the table around.) Paid our bill and left. Apparently management ok with this behaviors."}
{"text":"A pretty good place...nice ambiance, very good service and tasty food. The herbed bread was amazing as was the Thyme infused strawberry mule. Their mule was actually one of two best I've had in the valley. The other one was at the JW Marriott. 

The skirt steak was a little more chewy than I'd like but since it was a less expensive cut of meat it wasn't a big deal. The olives were tasty but I prefer the mix of colors and sizes at Postino or The Living Room. 

Someone gave me a gift card for $25, which is why we went. I'd probably go back for an appetizer or happy Hour but for the price prefer restaurants with larger portions. 

I have to give them a high rating though because the bread, bernaise sauce and mule were amazing. I'm a picky eater and don't like sauces or gravy...but the bread dipped in the bernaise sauce was heaven!

Note: we were seated on a bench seat with two small tables pushed together. The floor was so slippery, the table pushed out when you leaned against it. If I was with an older person, I'd definitely watch out for this...if someone held onto the table to get up, they might slip."}
{"text":"Cute place. Great patio.  Get the bolognese it was delicious! Great for brunch!  Just expect a slow service."}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday night and the place was crowded.  It took about 10 minutes to get water, and for that we had to hail a passing waiter.  We waited longer, and it turned out that our waitress had gone missing.  The guy who got our water took over and he was very good.  I got the French onion soup, which was excellent.  The drunken bread was great.  The crab cake was so-so.  Cucumber mule cocktail was great.  

This place is really really noisy, though.  It seems one of those places designed to maximize noise to make it seem \"happening.\"  It was also kind of dark, so much so that I had to pull out my phone to read the menu.  To me that is a bit pretentious."}
{"text":"Went back to Local Bistro this week.....still a great experience! Nice gazpacho was a surprise for me....I love that stuff, and theirs is tasty and fresh. Friends had the gorgeous pappardelle with rich meat sauce...also linguine with seafood...my husband had a bite of a scallop and he told me it was divine! I did not like the drunk bread, because I felt that the wine made the bread soggy. Desserts were tasty, with Nutella cheesecake a fun treat. Always think of L.B. if you want great food and proper service."}
{"text":"The place is great, love it every time we go. Great food and value. A little loud but not too bad. I'm a regular for sure!"}
{"text":"If you don't want to have actual conversations with the people at your table, than this is the place for you!  Due to the band that was there for Father's Day brunch, we couldn't even talk to each other because the music was so loud in there. Singers or a band might be great for a late night dinner, but for brunch?  Not so much!  Although we did love the food, the atmosphere really ruined it for us."}
{"text":"A true neighborhood gem.  The owner really has gotten it right.  From the beautiful simple decor to the flawless execution.  The staff is always extremely friendly and attentive. This restaurant is a must visit every time we come to town.  

This has become a favorite spot for everyone we have brought here!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed my lunch here immensely! This is the former Eddie Chan's location in the Fry's Shopping center. So I will say that since this is so close to home....makes me even happier!
Upon first glance at the menu....its one of those restaurants that list so many of my favorite flavors of salads to pizza and many other yummy entrees....that I have a hard time deciding.....don't you LOVE that?!
The decor is very pleasing - rustic modern and everyone was very friendly."}
{"text":"Love this place 
Steak frites is amazing 
Expansive wine list 
Very knowledgeable staff
Great local place to go
One of my faves"}
{"text":"I went to Local Bistro with my mom two weeks ago. She has some trouble seeing and knocked a glass off the table and it shattered everywhere.  Brandon, the assistant manager, was so nice to my mom about the accident, brushed it off with a smile.  Our waitstaff Christine did not miss a beat, she was fabulous. To top everything off, the food was delicious. So if are looking for a place that works on all levels, I highly recommend going to Local Bistro. I know we will be back on a regular basis.
Sandra D."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday with my husband for the first time.  We were waited on and placed our order.  The menu was hard to choose from since alot of their dishes were MKT prices.  There are other North Scottsdale restaurants that are much better for the same prices that Local Bistro charges.  The waitress came with our water with no ice.  There was no bread and butter while you wait.   Another restaurant crossed off the list."}
{"text":"We won't be back. Sat on outside patio & were then soaked by the musters. When we told the waiter we were getting drenched, we had NO response. 20 minutes later, as we were finishing up, the wait staff comes by to say someone complained  about the misters & they were turning them off. Really?"}
{"text":"Oh dear I just had the most amazing pumpkin filled, hand made pockets of love - called ravioli. How did something like this happen?  I'll tell you - Lots of love from the chef at this lovely establishment. 

My friend invited me out when he discovered they had fresh pumpkin related anything. So I raced over to see a beautiful bowl of hand made pasta pockets filled with the creamiest most amazing pumpkin yumminess that I have ever eaten. It had fresh fried sage leaves and an amazing sage and nutmeg butter. Parmesan cheese on top. Heaven in a bowl. Wow!!! 

My cocktail was freshly muddled cucumbers and lemon with my favorite Hendricks gin.  Life cannot get much better than this moment. 

The bartenders were extremely attentive and I was extremely pleased with the energy that flowed around the whole restaurant. 

I will definitely dine again!!"}
{"text":"Nice new restaurant addition to North Scottsdale!  I thoroughly enjoyed my spinach salad with walnuts, strawberries and goat cheese. It was entirely too big, but very good all the same.  The atmosphere was very nice and the service was good."}
{"text":"After visiting this bistro twice, I can say the food is good and their wine/alcohol selection is nice but the ticket time is horrendous. On each occasion it has taken upwards of 45 minutes to get our food! That is insane considering most restaurants have entrees on the table in less than 20 minutes. The food was good, but not worth the wait."}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere, decor and patio, but if you want to have a more quiet dinner this isn't the place. The open table concept creates a a louder environment. Louder did I say?!

We came for happy hour and had appetizers. Tried the ahi tuna tartare and the Kanger Sampler which had a great variety for the table to pick from. Tartare was good, a little bland for my tasting. 

Service was okay, a little slow on the water fill up. Would try this place again for dinner. Always a constant flow of people at Local bistro. Great place to have near you."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar tonight and as an industry professional I have to say, great experience! Courtney was training behind the bar and I asked her to tell us her favorite between the mussels or the crab cake. She said, although both are great she really liked the crab cake. We went with it. Fantastic! Nice acidity in the sauce and we liked the change from the usual creamy, dijon remoulade found at most places. My friend had the salmon entree and it was fantastic. Love the pesto mash plating. I love the saffron linguini and clams and came in craving that dish. It came out and was not the memory of flavor I remembered. Bland and watered down with only the red pepper coming through I let Courtney know it just wasn't right. She was quite polite and got the manager involved. He listened and with sincerity quickly addressed it. He remade the dish and delivered it back within a reasonable time and it was worth tbe wait. Perfection!!! So happy. We finished with Tiramisu which was just a great ending and a treat since we typically don't order dessert. Nicely done. As a side note I felt the trainer helping Courtney was really great. We could see her taking her time and showing her as well as allowing her to take the lead. Nice job ladies!!"}
{"text":"Went for brunch today.  Really nice bottomless bloody marys!  Also loved the Spanish skillet.  The wife had a nice chicken salad which had really nice flavor.  Paired perfectly with her glass of sauv blanc.  We also shared some pancakes which were nice and fluffy.  My dad had a steak and eggs which was cooked to a perfect medium rare with 2 sunny side up eggs, and my mom had the bolognese.  The only piece of advice that I can suggest is that the Spanish skillet should come with some toast for sopping up the sauce.  Other than that it was a perfect brunch!"}
{"text":"Went as a group of 4 for the Sunday brunch this past Sunday. The atmosphere was great; they do a good job keeping the live music to a reasonable level so you can actually hear the people next to you. Their menu is a little confusing in that the bottomless mimosas and Blood Mary's are in the same line item on the menu, but our waitress told us the price doesn't include both types of drinks, you have to pick one. The mimosas were what you expect, but our friends stated that the Bloody Mary's were extremely inconsistent in flavor. All the food looked great when it came out, but I personally think the lunch section of the menu could be expanded upon a little, as I personally tend to lean that way during brunch. I had the Salmon Ceaser Salad, which came exactly as expected. Overall just seemed like an average brunch location - nothing overly special about it to get me to come back."}
{"text":"Stopped in for impromptu anniversary dinner on a Wednesday night. There was a good crowd dining inside, outside and at the bar. We were still able to walk in and be seated immediately.

It's a noisy atmosphere but if you can understand, it's \"lively\" instead of annoying.  It felt like we were downtown but we didn't have to drive all the way down and deal with downtown hassles.

We started with calamari. It was interesting preparation. Rather than typical lightly fried in batter with red sauce, this was a spicier version served with different peppers and a chili aioli. It was really delicious. If you are afraid of spice, don't worry, it was only like a 3 out of 10.

They also served some house bread before the calamari came out, it was really good. I think there was rosemary in it.

We each had a signature cocktail. I had the Rosemary Cosmo- very delicious. My partner had the Peach Mule which he said was also great.

Before we even arrived, we knew we wanted steak for entree. I was going to get skirt steak but they ran out. We both got the NY strip. We are not high-rollers in the least, so dropping $39 per steak, it had better be good. Well let me tell you, these steaks were worth every penny. Hands down best steak I can ever recall having. We both had ours done medium. I personally don't know why you would ruin a steak cooking it any longer. The steaks were big. Our knives sliced through them like warm butter. The brandy cream sauce was delicious. They were topped with fried onions and accompanied by thinly sliced potatoes and small onions. I am a bottomless pit, but I wanted to save room for dessert so I actually had to take a piece home. (which didn't survive the night, haha).

For dessert we both had the tiramisu. Again, top-notch, delicious, I don't know what else to say.

The next time I am craving a steak, I know where I will be going."}
{"text":"Really great place. The food is excellent, hip bar scene, great daily specials. I had the risotto last visit which was excellent. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to try this place for brunch. The reviews looked great. I don't know if it was an off-day but it wasn't a great experience. The server was a [use your imagination]. Maybe he was hung over? It was Sunday morning. Our food arrived 45 minutes after we sat down. Food was cold. It was reasonably tasty but much too salty. We eat out a lot. I know when it's there's too much salt - even for restaurant food. Just to end the day on a high-note, the last gulp of coffee my wife took was all coffee grounds. The company was great and it was a nice morning but I expected MUCH better from this restaurant."}
{"text":"Awesome place now that it has been remodeled. Great wine!  Best mussels!  My favorite place in the area!"}
{"text":"Cons.... Need reservation in advance.
Pros...... Every single item on the menu. I know, we have had them all. This is my favorite place to eat. Just when I thought it couldn't get any better, Sunday Brunch. They have an Italian toast that is dipped in custard, served with fresh fruit. So long French toast.... I'm now a Italian morning person:) add any meat product if you like, they are all yummy!"}
{"text":"I have been here on multiple occasions and will be back for sure. All the food is great from the risotto to the steak frites(my favorite) they also have lots of good beers and a pretty decent wine list.

There is usually some good people watching as well.

I'm craving the drunken bread right now."}
{"text":"Delicious! I had the Sweet Corn & Shrimp Pasta and my husband had the chopped bacon/avocado/grilled chicken salad with a side of their delicious bread. All of our food was five star and our waitress was friendly and knowledgeable. (I was concerned about the pasta being spicy bc the menu mentioned Thai peppers in the sauce but she assured me the pasta was not spicy and she was right. The pasta sauce was the perfect combination for the sweet corn and shrimp.)"}
{"text":"Pretty nice place, very open  seating area and large covered outdoor patio.  Colin our Waiter took good care of us.  Decent wine list we had a Bergstrom pinot noir from Oregon that was very nice.   The herb bread and butter was very fresh and tasty. We shared the shrimp appetizer which had a nice sauce, very mild and crunchy bread.  The drunken bread looked good but we were not that hungry.  We had the Caesar salad and the arugula salad.  My husband does not care for beets but I enjoyed the arugula salad with beets, goat cheese and pine nuts.  The dressing was nice and light.  Looks like a nice bar area for happy hour.  I would go back and get a bigger meal next time!"}
{"text":"I live in Los Angeles, and everytime I go to Scottsdale, I have to make a couple of stops to Local Bistro!  The food is amazing!  The ambience is hip, sexy and fun, and you can't beat the price for the calibre of food that you get.  I have had many of their appetizers and entrees.  The drunk bread and beef carpaccio as appetizers are phenomenal! Their parpadella bolognese is to die for, their salmon is delicious, and the grilled shrimp is fantastic!  Like my husband says, \"it's damn good food!\"  The service is wonderful, their wine list and drinks are superb and we always feel welcome!  I just wish they would open a Local Bistro here in LA!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time recently. 

The food was great. Excellent appetizer with three dips. Our meals came out quickly and we loved them. I got a kale salad and it was delightful. 

Drinks were okay. The sangria was very bitter and not my favorite. 

The environment was dark and a little noisy which made it difficult to talk to each other. 

But the food is worth a try. I'd go back for that salad anytime."}
{"text":"Food deserves 4 to 5 stars but service was at that of a Denny's. We sat for at least 5 minutes before someone came for us to order drinks. We sat another 10 minutes before they came back for us to order. It wasn't even busy! To top it off the server misheard my husbands order, so the wrong food was brought to the table. My husband sent it away and they did bring the correct pancakes. We received the bill, server explained she swiped our card with two sets of pancakes then swiped our card with one set. First, I think the difference of price should be taken care of by the restaurant not us because my husband had to watch us eat for 5 minutes before his correct order came out, and to swipe our card twice? Honestly, good food, but we won't be back. And $6.00 for a small fresh squeezed OJ, I don't think so."}
{"text":"Although the wait was a little longer than desired the food and service was worth the wait.  The atmosphere was open and inviting and hopefully next time they'll have something on the patio available.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great food, very sweet staff, fantastic wine list.
Try the mussels, ask for extra bread for dipping.
I plan on putting this place on my monthly rotation."}
{"text":"We go here every few months and really enjoy ourselves. Food is exceptional and never disappoints. We like to sit at the bar because the tables are very close to each other. The bar area is very nice but the bartenders aren't the friendliest you will find. After going here at least a half dozen times I expect a bartender to at least pretend to notice that we are regulars and at least say something other than \"do you know what you want to drink\". The bartenders do find the time to chit chat with each which is rather rude."}
{"text":"Having recently dined at Central Bistro, we decided to give this North Scottsdale favorite a try.  Unfortunately that night, the restaurant fell short of its reviews.  When we first got there, we anticipated a wait and were going to sit at the bar but the hostess suggested the patio.  It was a warm-ish night and the hostess sat  us at a two top next to the parking lot.  The mister dripped all over us and cars pulling in and out blinded us with their headlights.  When we asked to be moved, the hosted could only think of moving us to another two top with the same conditions.  Frustrated, we walked by her back into the main room and told her we would wait.
Papardelle Bolognese when I heard the pasta was fresh made in house.  While we waited for our entrees, we attempted to break bread, then tried to cut it with a knife.  The bread was so , it was not a chewy crust but a hard shell.  We never did eat the bread and were never asked what was wrong.  Soon thereafter, our entrees appeared and my wife relished her choice.  The salmon was cooked perfectly and seasoned just right without some citrus-y sweet goo that many restaurants use to cover the fish.  her fingerling potatoes and vegetables were cooked to a firm perfection.  Next, I dug into my long anticipated pasta only to be disappointed in a thick, super wide tasteless pasta that wan not chewable.  The sauce was a tasty melange of meat and tomatoes but was not enough to overcome the pasta's shortcomings.  I set that aside and our waitress came by and said, \"Is there anything wrong?\"  It was obvious and she said she would get the manager.  He came over and I explained my disappointment and offered to replace it.  I have a policy not to order again because when you return food, the staff is upset.  They care less about the customer than their work.  Due to the late hour and my hunger pangs I ordered a cheeseburger and fries to make it quick and easy.  Again, within a few minutes, the manager appeared with my replacement order.  I cut the burger in half and noticed it was cooked a perfect medium rare.  I took a bite and savored the charcoal grilled flavor.  In my second bite, the flavor changed to a heavy salt flavor so i opened the burger and found clumps of salt and clumps of seasoning.  Rather than return a second meal, I scraped the salt and seasoning off the top and finished it.  I could not eat the fries because of the heavy dose of salt.  When the waitress and manager came back, I told them, it was cooked perfectly to temperature and asked for our check.  We paid and left right away.  No offer for a comp desert or anything but no loss.  We were glad to get out of there.   There may not be another visit in our future."}
{"text":"Best. Brunch. Ever. 

I had the eggs Benedict Oscar style and was in complete heaven. The mimosas were perfection. They bring the champagne in one glass and you can add your own juice at your leisure. Finally! Someone knows how to serve a mimosa! Their champagne was dry, and not overly sweet. Which is exactly how I like it. The waitstaff was top notch and super attentive. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Good date night spot. Cocktails are well made, service at the bar is great. Service that evening in the dining room - so so. The food is really good. We started with the mussels and they were excellent. My fiancé had the steak and frites (he loved it), I had the butternut squash pasta. I still dream about it. It was fantastic. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Previously, I would have given Local Bistro 5 stars, but the owner, German, and GM, Hudson, are firing staff and paring down the menu which has significantly lowered my evaluation. The atmosphere has changed radically in the last month (November 2014.) Gone are many of the friendly and professional bartenders, wait staff, and hostesses that made Local Bistro such a pleasure to dine on a frequent basis. (We hope they never let the bartenders J & S go.) This used to be the go-to restaurant for locals to enjoy happy hour and good conversation. What they don't realize is that most of their regulars are now disenchanted, vocalizing complaints, and are leaving for other restaurants in the area (There is plenty of competition in the area and Pure Sushi, Soul Cafe, Isabella's & Herb Box all are more welcoming.) It's turned into a hostile working environment for the remaining employees, afraid for their jobs... 
The winter menu is greatly reduced, full of carbs, and lacks the favorites of the past (e.g. meatballs, simple mussels.)
The management team doesn't seem to realize the importance of the relationship of the staff with the customer. It might as well be a franchise...

{"text":"Ready, Cool modern casual room. Great drinks( some basil gimlet thing). Food, all homemade pastas. Wife had squid ink seafood pasta and I had chicken parm the size of my head. Both I think $19 and great. Service was perfect. They were happy to see us. It felt good to be there. It was our first time. Great sat night meal out, under $100."}
{"text":"Tucked away not so far off of the 101 and Hayden, Local Bistro remains a popular eatery and brags an inviting but crowded bar on a Friday evening. This contemporary setting is sleek but the Edison hanging pendant lights in the back warm the environment. I love that the outside of the restaurant even says: \"Pasta. Pizza. Steak. Wine.\" This is reinforced on the menu heading. They are great at exactly what they advertise.

Appetizer:
Drunk Bread - Swiss fondue, white wine, and crusty bread. I asked if they could top the crusty bread with prosciutto and my wish was granted. So awesome!!!

Calamari - the chili aioli really set this crispy but tender not chewy at all calamari off! Don't forget to order this popular fav! 

Dinner: 
Spanish Risotto - seafood, chorizo, saffron, pimentón de la vera. This reminded me of a delicious paella! 

Double cut pork chop - served with truffled polenta, bacon, escarole, port wine reduction. Rich, decadent tender love... Basically everything you'd want it to be reading the description. 

Seafood linguini - black linguini, mkt seafood, lobster bisque.  My mother in law really enjoyed this dish! She loved how there were equal parts of linguini and seafood bc most restaurants give heaps of pasta and little seafood but Local Bistro makes sure the focus is on its flavorful fresh seafood, not to out stage the intriguing black linguini

Desserts:
Zeppoli - warm donuts with trio of sauces. This will take care of your sweet fix for sure!

I am so glad that my hubby and I took my mother in law here for her birthday! The setting was beautiful, the service was great, and it boasts a lovely atmosphere! Definitely make reservations though on weekends. It gets pretty crowded."}
{"text":"The food here is exceptional, as is the service. Even though this is quite upscale, and more for adults, they were very welcoming and accommodating to our little family. The waitresses were attentive, without being pushy, and we all left feeling very content, even the little one! We also love that it is so close to our place in Grayhawk."}
{"text":"Local has a pretty good happy hour, but just as a note, the well drinks advertise as $5.00 but depending on your mixer it could be as much as $7.00."}
{"text":"I will not be back. This jam jar, bad boy, just screwed up my lunch with his \"kiss my butt\"  attitude. I sensed a raised level of testosterone from the point that I hit the bar. 

I never got offered condiments, I felt like I was imposing to order and he never smiled. FN, take a happy pill. This is a service industry! Go back to the MMA or wrestling alligators. 

I normally like the place and the vibe but GI Joe killed it for me. I won't be back with my friends. That is a promise! I'll ship over some lavender bath though. It may help someones attitude... Oh, I almost forgot, he NEVER asked me how my food was or if I needed anything until I was ringing out. Ugh... Too bad, I love the Drive Thru Burger.

{"text":"The restaurant features a menu with items from France, Spain and Italy, so there's a little something for everyone. The decor was cute, with brick walls, stacks of wood lining the entry way and a big wine display next to the bar (which features television.)

It's not really romantic, especially given the fact the radio plays pop music-it's more of a high-energy spot great for groups, with some upscale touches such as linen napkins and professional-looking servers.

One of my favorite parts of the meal was the cocktails. I first tried a Basil Gimlet ($10), which was so fragrant because of the fresh basil leaf in the drink. It was strong but so refreshing and contained Hendricks gin, basil, lime and agave. I loved it, and my companion got two of them, they were so good

I also tried a Cucumber \"Collins\" ($10) which, like the Basil Gimlet, had fresh produce, cucumber slices, in the drink. It also contained Square One Cucumber, lemon, sugar and mint and was very refreshing as well. Both drinks were light, but I felt the effects of the alcohol-perfect cocktails!

For my meal, I started with a Farm Salad ($5), with mixed greens, tomato, shaved carrots, toasted walnuts, rustic croutons (soooo good!) and a dijon vinaigrette. It was pretty much the perfect salad. It was pretty and colorful, it had really fresh veggies, and the dressing was really tasty.

My companion started with the Soup of the Moment ($5), which had garbanzo, pancetta, fresh herbs, roasted garlic, truffle oil and focaccia croutons. He said the soup was really salty, which overpowered anything else he may have enjoyed about it.

For my meal, I got a Wild Mushroom pizza ($14), with wild mushrooms, fontina, truffle oil and arugula. The pizza was huge (I had to take half of it home), and it was generously topped. I really liked the soft, chewy dough, and the combination of ingredients really worked.

My pal got Salmon en Pappillotte ($18), with seasonal veggies and mashed potatoes. He didn't specify how he wanted it cooked and later complained it was too well done. Personally, if I was to eat meat, I would get it cooked as well as possible, so the salmon might have been great if he had just specified his preference.

Our dessert was pretty interesting. It was chilled cream that looked and tasted like flan. I hate flan, so the texture sort of creeped me out, but the taste was good, and I loved the homemade strawberry compote it was served with. I could have eaten just that for dessert and been happy. The dessert was a special for the night.

I would definitely go back to try some of their other options.  They have a ton of pasta dishes, including a mac n' cheese meal that sounds so good. Plus, the prices are affordable, and the atmosphere is cozy."}
{"text":"We have been regular customers of Local Bistro for a long time. It has always had a great atmosphere and the service staff is simply amazing. However, we visited Local Bistro this past Sunday after their long awaited remodeling, and were totally disappointed in the new Brunch Menu.  The space looks fabulous and the staff are still fantastic but the menu is just so sad. All of the favorites my husband and I used to order for brunch have been removed and replaced by things such as \"Root Beer Waffle\"?  You cannot order simply scrambled eggs - there are only benny's and omelettes.  I ended up ordering the \"Lemon Ricotta Pancakes\" - topped with a  blueberry compote instead of fresh berries - to say the least, it was not good. The two women sitting next to us ordered the same thing and had the same response.  It seems the restaurant has gone to the dark side with this menu and are trying to be so \"out of the box\" that nothing is appealing. I am vegetarian and have always been able to find tasty items on their menu, but not this time.  We love going there and just hate that this has happened."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful evening last night. Suzie, our server was courteous, professional and attentive throughout. She was great with suggestions for our 16 month old who lapped up every course she presented. The food was excellent. The Wild Mushroom soup and Scallops were particularly good. The wine list was pretty extensive and good value overall. The place was busy and buzzing with atmosphere and we look forward to returning in the near future."}
{"text":"When you enter a place with a sign that reads \"Pizza. Pasta. Steak. Wine.\", you'd expect to actually be able to order some of those things. Well, apparently not. According to the waitress, it's only a slogan and only on specific days at specific times can you order any of those listed foods. When we finally settled and ordered from a very limited menu our food was disappointing to say the least. The Local Cheeseburger and Drunken Enchilada were decent, but nothing one would consider special enough to talk about. However the Summer Peach Salad that I ordered really should've been named the Summer Feet Salad. Not that I would know what foot sweat would taste like, but if I had to take a wild guess, I'd say that combination of vaguely sweet and uncomfortably salty would nail it. The cherry to this crap sundae was when the waitress noticed the feet salad went untouched, but failed to ask if everything tasted okay or if there was anything she could do to correct the order. The only thing she did ask was if she could bring me a box. The only box that was needed was a pine box to bury the feet salad and put it out of its misery.   3 out 10 would not recommend!"}
{"text":"Opened late last year, Local Bistro seems to be hitting the sweet spot in North Scottsdale with well priced food, drinks and a snazzy yet comfortable atmosphere. Heading the kitchen up is chef Andrea Volpi, who brings a fresh approach by sourcing many of their ingredients from local purveyors. 

Showcasing his talents was apparent from the first taste of his heavenly Prosciutto Pizza ($12). The house made mozzarella was delightfully meaty with just the right amounts of peppery arugula and salty prosciutto. Even fry basket basics like Calamari ($9) were light, crisp and tender without an ounce of excess oil.

The menu is pretty straight forward with plenty of mass appeal including pizza, pasta, steaks and fish. I usually have a rule about eating fish in a land locked state, how fresh can it be right? Defying my own rule I went ahead and ordered LB's Ahi Tuna Tartar ($10), good thing too because it was as fresh as it could be. Mixed with avocado and atop a bed of citrus creme, the texture was akin to butter with notes of lemon which only added to the lightness of this starter. I preferred slathering the mixture onto the pillowy moist crumb of LB's house bread in lieu of the accompanied crostini.

I'm thinking Drunk Bread ($12) is more about texture than taste. They take thick cut bread, soak it in white wine, mount it with Gruyere cheese and then it goes for a quick sun tan in the broiler. The result wasn't exactly bursting with flavor but the luscious character was pleasant though not entirely satisfying.

These days every place has some sort of hamburger on the menu. With more burgers come a higher standard and the question, which has the best? Let me tell you that LB's Angus Burger ($12) ranks pretty high. All the standards are intact with some delicious variations including grill tomato, asiago cheese and zinfandel braised onions. Smokey, sweet, tender and juicy this burger was so happening that in future visits I would be hard pressed to order anything else. 

Chicken Parmesano ($16) wasn't exactly what one might expect. A large organic chicken breast was pounded out, breaded, fried and served only with a layer of parmigiano cheese on top, sans red sauce. This combination was well balanced with a lightly dressed salad of cherry tomatoes and arugula, sauce on the side.

As I sit here writing about how well their food prepared I'm still haunted by the mediocre service we received. It got so bad at one point that we actually got up out of our table to find basics like salt and pepper. After that our server was more attentive but I still had a stick in my craw. I ordered a Basil Gimlet ($9) which arrived in a standard martini glass that was only half full, or was it half empty? Metaphor's aside, I called our server on it in which I got a shrug, \"that's how we serve it\". It's not a deal breaker but come on, stingy and bitchy, really? While there wasn't much in the glass, it was a tasty drink leaving me wanting another. 

Aside from the service problem, the food was spot on. Now this makes the glass half full, right?"}
{"text":"First time here and with all the good reviews thought we couldn't lose.  Ordered a Caesar salad, fresh romaine but no other flavor to speak of.  

Entree had the mushroom taglattlla?  It was also very bland.  Wife had another pasta dish that had noodles that where way to big for the dish I thought it did have a better flavor than my dish.. 

A lot a wine choices, and a constant flow of people.

Happy hour only at bar or in lounge.


Probably will not return"}
{"text":"Best brunch I have had visiting Scottsdale - service was spot on - I had the chicken - waffle and egg - very filling and delicious- bottomless mimosa is always a good idea-will come back again"}
{"text":"Must of been a really off night!  After closing for a bit to remodel the food seemed sub par.  Fries were soggy, soup came out \"not hot\" and there was an error in our order and it had to be remade.  A manager came over and said he had comped some food however when we got the bill it was never adjusted.  Awkward.  

They have added gluten free pizza to the menu however we added chicken and a very small pizza became $28!!!!!

There is some new staff and our wait gal was great."}
{"text":"This place is the worst!  Terrible service and food.  I heard such good things about this place but the food was bland and over priced.  The worst part was that I found a hair in my food!  The waitress said it was probably mine, but my hair is only a quarter inch long.  Avoid at all cost!!!  They think they are an exclusive place, but just a string mall type restaurant with a bad attitude."}
{"text":"Came here Monday night for a sibling reunion. We started with a $24 appetizer plate that was excellent in taste but lacking in quantity - especially for 24 bucks. 

My sister ordered the Angus Burger - Delicious and well priced.
Her girlfriend and my husband both ordered the Seafood Linguine - Very good, a little pricey, could have done with more shrimp and less clams.
My brother and I decided to share the \"BIG\" plate (that's what it stated on the menu) of grilled shrimp. We were both under the impression that this meal would be big enough to feed the both of us - and considering it was a whopping $18 I really thought I'd be asking to take home a doggy bag had I ordered it for just myself.
To be honest, when the guy brought out our meal to share, I thought it was a total joke. My brother and I couldn't believe how little was on this BIG plate...Four shrimps and about 1/4 cup of risotto. 
I wound up eating half my sister's fries, taking two bites of her burger and sharing my husband's linguine just to make up for what I lacked off my BIG plate. 

I should also say that I loved the music they played at this restaurant. It was very ambient electronica and fit the place perfectly.

Aside from mine and my brother's measly dinner costing a ridiculous $18, from what I could tell everything else was \"A-OK.\"
I'd eat here again, just order something other than the Grilled Shrimp."}
{"text":"Hello carb heaven! 

Prepping for a race? Love pizza? Looking for great wine? Come to local bistro! 

They've revamped the place and it's trendy, sleek and yummy.

We had drunk bread to start... Awesome. Just get it, you won't be disappointed. Follow by a pizza which was equally as tasty. Their beet dish is amazing and burrata is to die for.

They have a great wine list, as well homemade Signature cocktails. I opted for the skinny margarita with had muddled blueberries and homemade mix. 

Some of my happy hour companions had the Makers Mark slushy and raved about it. We even had a peggo in tow, and the server went out of their way to have the bartender make a virgin mojito for her!

All around good vibe and great food. Definitely a nice, and reasonably priced place if you are in the DC Ranch/Greyhawk area! 

Kudos to the restaurant group on another fantastic restaurant!"}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend here for his birthday dinner on a Sunday night.  I had been a few times (once for brunch and once years ago).  It was busy, but not chaotic.  The set up allows for a quiet conversation w/o having to scream to hear each other over the other patrons.  I like that.

We ordered the burrata appetizer-- TO DIE FOR!  The burrata was decadent, and the tear drop tomatoes were perfect, not overripe, not bitter-- just right.  We also had the calamari app, which was great.  Not heavily battered, which is best.

I had the skirt steak with herb butter-- heavenly.  The herb butter was a great compliment and I could still taste the grilled meat.

My boyfriend ordered the seafood linguine (black linguine- nice touch) and it was super yummy, he ate EVERY bite.  It had a rich tomato sauce and plenty of great fish: scallops, mussels, clams, shrimp and calamari.  Very very tasty.

I told our server it was my boyf bday, he brought us a complimentary panna cotta dessert  with a candle that topped the night off just right.  I had never eaten panna cotta before and I was pleasantly surprised!

For the amazing meal we had plus an alcoholic beverage for each of us, the price was right.  Under $100.00 for appetizers, two meals and drinks.  :-)

We will be back time and time again!"}
{"text":"Jonathan was our waiter. He was super friendly and attentive.

I ordered the Trout Amandine and it was great.  My husband had the ribeye and loved it!

Good wine selection and generous pours.  All around great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and really enjoyed dishes made from local fresh ingredients. Service was friendly and I really liked the way the server presented lemon plate when I asked a slice of lemon for my water. 

For appetizer, I ordered tuna tartare - avocado, crème fraîche, jalapeño pesto, sesame crisp.  Tuna was fresh and went well with avocado paste. Great appetizer to share, I thought it would be nice to have before start drinking (tuna and avocado help)

I ordered pasta bolognese - beef, pork, veal, tomato ragú for my lunch. I asked them to boil pasta al dente and they actually delivered pasta al dente. Sauce was very meaty, I became full a half way through my lunch. Very flavorful sauce indeed.

My friend ordered seafood salad - crab salad, marinated squid, shrimp, orange vinaigrette, after I saw the salad and I smelled nice squid, I secretly wished I was the one ordered the salad. I had a bite of squid and it was so tender and flavorful, would have enjoyed eating the whole salad myself. Perhaps next time I will order this salad for me.

For desert, I ordered tiramisu. I knew I was going to do exercise a lot that weekend, I truly enjoyed my tiramisu guilt free. Love the texture of mascarpone cheese and coffee flavor.  Did you know tiramisu has a meaning \"pick me up\" and \"cheer me up\"?  No wonder why I am always happy after eating tiramisu.... Must be the chocolate/cocoa.  And YES, their tiramisu was soooooo gooooood."}
{"text":"This place is pretty fabulous. Awesome food, great decor/atmosphere and excellent service - they even bring you a tray of citrus to add to your water... LOVE! Plus, you can't go wrong with bottomless bloody mary's & mimosas on Saturday & Sunday. Yes, please! I've only had brunch & lunch there but want to check out Happy Hour soon!"}
{"text":"Stopped in this restaurant for a late lunch and waited about 5 minutes before anyone acknowledged we were there.  Manager came by and he could not have been more rude and pompous.  We left without sitting down.  Might need to look for people who are a little more focused on customer service."}

I had the pasta bolognese which was pretty good.  Large serving and plenty of meat sauce.  My friend had the monkey bread for brunch and liked it.

The bottomless mimosas on the weekends are a nice touch.  Service was a little slow but I would come back here again."}
{"text":"As a past local favorite I wish I could offer more stars; however, our recent experience reflects poor management and we all know how it starts at the top.
This post has NOTHING to do with the food experience whatsoever - the kitchen does an amazing job.

It has to do with our server not \"getting it\" along with presenting an attitude of \"I wish I didn't have to be here and his lack of a service attitude\"

Side note - I live locally and have been to Local Bistro many times over the years.  I have even had this server in the past.

The hand-written  \"Steals and Deals\" paper sign on the wall offers  current wine specials is the cause for this negative post.  We were advised that our first selection off this list was sold out and although disappointed, we selected  another option from the the written list on the paper wall display. 
Having enjoyed that bottle, and just 6pm no less, we asked for a second for our party and was told there is no more of that selection either and we could order a similar wine not on the list. We asked the price difference and were told just $3.00. I then asked the server if the manager would pick up the $3.00 difference due to them being out of now two of our selections and before I could finish my sentence he was shaking his head no. We chose the new option that was available. We did ask the server why they couldn't simply draw a line through the options on the paper wall menu so guests are aware that certain wines were no longer available-  he shrugged and walked away. My husband asked the manager on duty about this and was told - it takes a long time to write this menu and there are tables in the way and still more reasons why simply crossing out the sold out wines was not an option. My husband felt the same \"I don't care attitude\" from the manager .  She did listen but offered no solution. Understand, any employee (or even myself )  could have easily reached this paper wall menu (with no ladder) to simply update current wine availability as of 6pm on a Monday night.

As local year-round residents, we are aware of the numerous dining options in our area and although we truly appreciate the food - the less then stellar operations and service will send us to one of Local Bistros many competitors.

This is a principle thing - a service industry principle....."}

{"text":"Wow bad bad bad. We arrive for a 7:30 pm reservation, completed by the concierge at Sheraton Desert oasis.  We were seated and waited and waited. Ordered drinks, waited and waited. Ordered an appetizer that was to be on the house for we were staying at the Sheraton and the concierge booked a reservation. Order the linguine and clams and pork tenderloin.  Waited and and waited some more.  There was a total of 36 customers in the resturant, sadly lots of time to count.  The pork tenderloin was wrapped in completely burnt black bacon and pork tenderloin was so well done, I could have ate my shoe leather and it would have been much more tender.  The waiter offered to get us dessert but the dinner was such a disaster we just wanted to get out of there.  Sadly,  this was recommended by the concierge at Sheraton and was very poor service and execution. Clearly, no one was supervising the food that leaves the kitchen. We will not recommend anyone to eat here.

So now the Resturant emails and states they gave a credit for the un-edible burnt entrée and I should reconsider my review.  Sorry, the Resturant was not busy, multiple levels of mistakes shows 1. the chef did not give a shit by plating burnt over cooked food, 2. the expediter allowed burnt over cooked food to go to the waiter, and 3. the waiter agreed to serve burnt over cooked food.  Additionally, the reservation was made by the concierge from the Sheraton Desert oasis which was to include a free appetizer and the restaurant did not even honor the free appetizer."}

I'm only giving 2 stars because our food (crab omelet and short rib omelet) was good, otherwise I would have chosen 1 star.  The service was the worst I've had at any restaurant in the past 10 years.  We were sat immediately (Sunday 10:28a) and given water by the hostess.  Our server (if you really want to call him that), Izaiah, greeted us and took our drink orders.  11 minutes later our mimosa and Bloody Mary were served.  He took our orders and left.  I was out of water at this point and not offered any by any of the other servers that passed by our table including the manager.   As we watched all of the other tables get refills, food and such, we sat patiently.  A different server finally brought our meals.  My girlfriend ordered potatoes as a side and an English muffin.  I ordered bacon as a side.  She got fruit and no English muffin.  I got no bacon, just some cold toast.  We told this gentlemen this, and that we hadn't seen our server since he took our order.  He took our food back added my bacon and switched the fruit for the potatoes.  The manager then came over and asked how things were. I said we were still waiting on the English muffin and I would like a refill on water and our bottomless bloody Mary's and mimosas.  He made that happen.  The manager (English/Australian accent) has the personality of a doorknob, he said \"my apologies\" about the English muffin, but didn't ask if we needed anything else or if the food was good.  He waited on us more than our server, Izaiah, who seemed to brush us off after we mentioned we hadn't seen him since he took our order.  

Not sure why I even left a 16+% tip (I'm usually a 25% tipper), I truly contemplated leaving nothing, after discussing getting up and leaving before he ever came to take our food order.  

We really enjoyed this place before, but it seems to be going downhill.  We were here a month ago 2 times in a matter of 5 days and the bathrooms were out and we were told we had to go to Tavern Americana across the parking lot to use the restroom.  Not even sure a restaurant is legally able to operate without a functioning restroom.  

Too bad, the food can be good.  Very disappointing and directly reflects on the management of this restaurant in my opinion.  Not sure we will be back."}

{"text":"Best eating experience I've had in a long time! The staff members were all super friendly, and our waiter was really attentive--our glasses of water were always full. Portions are pretty large, and the food is great.  The \"drunk bread\" is amazing--definitely an appetizer worth trying!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here with friends and must say the place looked really great. There are two areas of outside seating, both of which are very attractive. I had my usual before dinner drink, well Scotch and water which I enjoyed very much. I was unpleasantly surprised, however, when the bill came I was charged $10 for Johnny Walker Black. Well Scotch, Walker Black...really!! I did not complain since we were with friends, but I will the next time I am there. The food, though, was another story. It was wonderful! Hubby and I had the Sunday roast chicken which was huge! One order would have been enough for an entire family. I never saw such a large chicken. I did not think they made them that big! The service was good but the server did not know a well Scotch from Walker Black. Won't sit at her table again!"}

Brunch: The eggs benedict was fabulous and came with a side of fruit and potatoes. They have a bottomless Bloody Mary & Mimosa deal - can't recall what it was, though.

Dinner: Get the drunk bread. You can taste the wine and the melted gruyère is the perfect touch. For an entree, I don't think I'll ever order anything besides the bolognese. Not a huge portion (I doubt you'll have leftovers), but absolutely amazing, you'll want to order another plate of it."}
{"text":"I am trying to be a better Yelper and my review of Local Bistro is long over due.  This is one of my favorite dining spots in the entire Valley.  In fact, my fiance and I literally fell in love with one another at this place about a year ago.  

Typically, we sit at the bar because we like the casual and efficient service.  The bartender will have our bottle of Malbec ready to serve when she sees us coming through the door.

My favorite dishes:

 #1 Drunk bread:  Ummm to DIE for delish!  A huge slab of ciabatta bread is soaked in white wine and baked with Gruyère cheese in a hot iron skillet.  It comes out bubbling and creamy.  If I didn't give 2 cents about the circumference of my thighs I would eat it ALL the time!

#2 Tuna Nicoise Salad.  It's healthy, fabulous, and filling.  Great as an entree or splitting as an appetizer.

#3 Chicken Parm: A huge portion of pounded chicken that is lightly battered.  It is big enough to share if your appetite is light or watching your portion size.  When sharing, we order extra arugula and marinara sauce.  Perfecto!

#4 Spanish Risotto:  WOW!  It's a phenomenon! A treasure of seafood surprises await your tastebuds with this risotto.

*TIP from a regular* - if you LOVE spicy then be sure to ask for the hot sauce called Mi Salsa.  I am a hot sauce ho and very critical.  This is one of the BEST I have ever had in my life.  

The owner ALWAYS comes by to welcome us.  There are plenty of \"good\" restaurants but the level of personalized service really keeps me coming back again and again. Local Bistro put a happy face on my heart and tummy."}

He is kind, professional, helpful and there when you need him. Answered my many questions as it was our first time there and he was patient with us. Great person.

Kids had pancakes, I stole a bite. They were the BEST I have ever had. Kids happily gobbled them up. Nice kids menu. 

The bolognese was divine and truly Italian with handmade pasta. My husband liked his omelette very much. 

We will be back for sure. 

The panacotta dessert was out of this world delicious. 

Nice atmosphere. Great find thanks to a friends recommendation.  I am already planning what I will have next. So many wonderful choices ..."}
{"text":"Service was AMAZING. Jonathan was very knowledgeable of the menu and recommended the truffle risotto with scallops that was incredible. Can't wait to come back and try some more entrees. We will be back. The Conundrum by Caymus is the best wine by the glass if your looking for a red."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.... this is our neighborhood Italian restaurant and the food has been very spotty and inconsistent.  On Friday we took an out of town friend and talked it up. My wife had the roasted chicken, a speciality of the house... it was over cooked and bone dry almost uneatable,  I had the chicken parm also over cooked, our guest had the meat pizza... undercooked and soggy.  We were a little embarrassed and did not want to complain or wait for another entre.We have had some very good meals here but there were 2 other occasions over the past 2 years that we were compt because the food was not up to par."}
{"text":"Amazing!!   Went for dinner last night for a birthday celebration and it was wonderful.  It has a great mix and variety of food from France, Spain and Italy (YUM!) as well as a great selection of wines (YUM! YUM!).  Our server was fantastic!  He and the entire staff were extremely attentive, friendly and personable.  He brought us an amazing vanilla panna cotta with caramel that was absolutely delicious for our celebration.  

They have a great happy hour that I have been to before and plan on going back to.  This one is a MUST try if you are in the area and worth the drive if you're not.  Buon Appetito!"}
{"text":"Went for an early supper with 2 companions. I live in San Francisco surrounded by celebrity chefs and excellent restaurants so I was astonished that the chef would allow an obviously over-cooked chicken breast topping my truffle risotto to leave the kitchen. The risotto was good, however. My companions split a pasta dish, though, that was too salty. The credit card software was down, so there was an interminable wait when we wanted to leave. These things happen, but I didn't need to receive an email from Open Table when I got home asking me, basically, to prove I was there, because we weren't checked in properly when we arrived. I visit Scottsdale often, but likely won't be back to this restaurant the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Visited Local Bistro for restaurant week and really enjoyed it!  My main entree was quite good. Their bread course was also delicious as well as unique.  I started with the frito misto which was good. My main selection was seared salmon served over cauliflower rice which was creamy and risotto-like along with some rainbow beets and fresh snap peas - crisp, sweet and delish! It was a generous and wonderful plate of food.  The salmon was cooked perfectly.

The desserts didn't hit the spot for me, but the rest of the meal was great and I enjoyed the space and the service."}
{"text":"Good food but outrageously over priced. A bistro is supposed to be a local neighborhood restaurant with reasonable prices not 5 star prices. The owners should look up the definition of Bistro.They have the nerve to list sea bass, filet mignon and steak at Market price. Never seen such a thing these items are standard menu offerings in any restaurant. $14 for fried calamari when most restaurants offer it between $9-$11. There are other restaurants Scottsdale with far better ambience for the same prices."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here last weekend and the food was great! The best part is the .1cent mimosa's after the first one is ordered! Great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Do you like a restaurant that is so loud you fear for your health? Do you like missing 1/2 of the conversation and sitting around like a dummy pretending you know what everyones talking about- maybe you know sign language? 
The food was pretty good but the service was super slow, we asked for bread and waited forever, we couldn't even get drunk- drinks too slow. the bill was $95.00 for a very simple dinner per couple, one drinnk each and one coffee each- no dessert.
So overall- I will only go back back if I get patio seating. The patio is not glamous at all, it is overlooking the parking lot so you get nice bright headlights in your face every 5 minutes. Its too hot to sit outside for the next three months. Overall I say pass. 
Or, better yet, redocorate to have noise reduction. 
It is crazy crazy loud- I cannot stress enough how freakin loud it was."}
{"text":"In spite of their recent less than perfect health grade, I'm still a huge fan of Local Bistro. I love the bar with the open window. The social hour menu is amazing. The brunch is also amazing, but their bloody mary's and mimosa's are worth passing on - no matter how tempting bottomless sounds. At any rate, the food is good and the service is top notch. I'll be returning over and over."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots... Really really cool happy hour great food great atmosphere and great location... As a matter fact I need to get back there ASAP! The Bolognese what is the most amazing dish and they also have a couple salads that I love... The strawberry mozzarella is the one I recall... Looks like I might be seeing you guys tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance, excellent wait staff and the food was amazing.  I got the chicken and the portion was huge.  I think it was an entire half chicken.  I will say that the ratio of veggies and potatoes to chicken was a little low.  My party and I had a great experience overall."}
{"text":"I've never ordered anything off the menu that I haven't liked! The atmosphere is cool and relaxing and the staff is very genuine and helpful. As a pasta lover, I was pleased to find they had plenty of options. Also the dessert berries are delicious!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a nice evening out with the family. Two kids under 10, great menu options even for them. Nice atmosphere for all. Service was exceptional. We will be going back."}
{"text":"We were looking for a nice place for my daughter's birthday dinner so we turned to Yelp and found this place and decided to give it a try based on the reviews.
I couldn't book it online through Open Table for some reason so I called to make a reservation which was not a big deal and the girl who took the reservation asked if this was a special occasion so I told her. 
We were seated right away. Our server meant well but he was not the best. And it took quite awhile for our orders to be taken. We waited for what seemed to be a long time for our food to the point where I saw people who came in after us had their meal. 
And we were not impressed with the food although the restaurant is very nice.  At the end, the \"special occasion\" was not brought up and we didn't really care but what was the point of asking at the time of reservation if nothing was going to be done?"}
{"text":"They have a mew menu and it is really fantastic 
Their new selections for steaks including the Manhattan Cut NY strip is excellent 
They offered a whiskey peppercorn sauce with it and it was really great
We shared a chicken liver pate that was absolutely fabulous 
The restaurant continues to get better all the Time and their wait staff are very friendly"}
{"text":"Amazing Sunday brunch! The patio has a great feel to it. The bottomless mimosas and bloody marys were good. I had the drunken enchiladas and they were a good amount of spicey. They bring you out water and offer you lime, lemon, orange wedges on a platter. Oh, & the french onion soup was just as good as can be. The menu had such attractive options on it. I wanted to try some of the sweet options, just wish they were small sides. 

I would love to come back during their \"social hour\" (a classier name for happy hour)."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for date night this evening after a friend recommended it.  Initially they could not find our reservation but assured us that they could seat us and apologized several times.  It turns out that when I called, they put it in for the following night and again, the manager came over to apologize and later brought us a complimentary dessert, which was appreciated, but completely unnecessary as they did seat us is a timely manner.  

We each had a drink, and were impressed with the extensive wine list and choice of beers for him.  The ambiance was great, and both inside and outside seating areas are very cute.

We started with the Drunk Bread, which was probably the best appetizer that we have ever had.  What is not to love about a thick piece of bread, soaked in white wine, with hot bubbly Gruyere cheese and prosciutto on top.  We happily  ate the entire thing and scrapped the cheese from the bottom.  My boyfriend ordered a Cesar salad, which he thought was very good and was of good size.

For entrees I ordered the special homemade pasta which was turkey and blue cheese ravioli with walnut cream sauce, which I very much enjoyed and will happily finish the left overs for lunch tomorrow as the portion size is fairly large!  My boyfriend ordered the Spanish Risotto which came with mussels, clams, calamari,  scallops, shrimp, and crab.  The amount of seafood was more than adequate and the risotto was fantastic!  To end the evening, they brought us complimentary dessert which was a wonderful surprise!  My boyfriend does not usually eat dessert, but tried it and ended up eating half of it because it was so tasty!

The services was fantastic, and the wait staff was nice and helpful and very attentive without being disruptive.  The manager came over multiple times to make sure things were ok while we were there, and even walked us out of the restaurant and asked us more about ourselves and thanked us for coming in. Our waiter, Shawn, was great.  He was helpful, happy, funny and helped answer all of my questions. 

This is definitely a place that we will return to and share with friends!"}
{"text":"After reading all the yelp reviews on Local Bistro my standing Thursday Lunch with a friend found us there.

Well we were disappointed!  It was not overly busy, and the service was marginal at best.  3 servers, 2 managers + bus staff covered the dining area.  Not too bad for the size.  We were sat at our table and it took about 10 minutes to be greeted by our server.  Okay, but then it was tedious at best from there.

We ordered a cup of the 'soup of the moment', Lobster Bisque w/Crab.  It was delicious...so we thought, will if the food is this good we could get over the service pretty darn quick!

My dining partner ordered the Chicken Panini w/side salad.  I had the Mushroom Swiss Panini w/frys.  These were served on a wooden cutting board, quaint and yet unappealing.  My friend notice large cracks in her board and was concerned how sanitary it was to eat off of.  How do they sanitize wooden boards?  I suspect they put them through the dishwasher, hence the large cracking we observed.  Never the less, it's a novel way to serve the sandwiches.  My mushroom panini was good, not great.  Actually somewhat dry.  Maybe due to there being over 50% of the sandwich containing bread.  The frys were grea,t when they were warm, as they cooled they became very paste like in flavor.  My compainions chicken sandwich contained an unoridinate amout of yellow peppers.  Once she removed them, the sandwich tasted better to her.  Once finished with 1/2 of her sandwich, she decided she'd had enough bread and pulled out the chicken to eat alone.  Well she couldn't eat it.  It was sooooo dry once you took all the condiments and goop off of it she could not eat it.  In fact she remarked that she needed her razor teeth to eat it. But, she loved the side salad. Water was not filled unless asked, we had to ask to pay our bill, etc....

So I don't know if I'd go back or not. MMMMMM  On the fence with that.  Maybe dinner would be better???  Very inconsistent was the experience."}
{"text":"It has been a bit over a year since I have Yelped this place...and happy to report that things are still wonderfully consistent and a delight. Our wedding anniversary is this week and we invited some dear friends to join us at Local last night to help us begin the early celebration, The service and food, once again, was stellar!  Matthew was our server and he was excellent...helpful but not gratuitous..nearby but not hovering. The calamari and drunken bread apps were wonderful..and new (to us) burrata app with fig was veryy tasty! Peg loved the duck risotto, and my pork tenderloin (polenta, brussel sprouts) Our guests had the lasagna and pork spare ribs...both incredibly tasty. I think I have sung the praises of the tiramisu before..but OMG...it is worth the carb count.  In  the midst of the craziness of a Saturday evening, two flutes of champagne arrived in the spirit of the occasion. The attention to detail is always very impressive here. So...if you have an opening for a place that will give you a great experience....I would encourage you to go Local!  Dr. B"}
{"text":"Good place, make sure to try the chipotle shrimp.  It can be quiet during the day.. only problems is with the Internet"}
{"text":"I guess I'm a little biased as my little sister used to work here and my family has said such good things about this place.  Finally got to try it yesterday for dinner before heading back to Vegas.  Very good food, great service.  I can see why everyone's so into it.  Wish I was around to have their all you can drink bloody mary & mimosas on Sundays ($12 I think).  Sweet!"}
{"text":"This is a great local restaurant - walking/biking distance from home. The service, food/drinks, and ambiance make it the perfect spot for meeting a group of friends to a nice date night. My only wish is that they would be open later...just in case we need food anywhere in Grayhawk after 10."}
{"text":"Over all it wasn't a very good experience. It's a very noisy place. The service was extremely slow. The waiter obviously didn't want to be there. The \"drunken bread\" was decent and different. But the salad had no taste. The chicken Parmesan was over cooked. It was a desert chicken-very dry. Cream brûlée doesn't have the silky texture. It's very dense and thick."}
{"text":"Came for the first time on a Friday night - booked on open table and requested a patio table. Was not offered a patio table - no problem.

Ambiance is nice and decor is fresh and fun, however, the booth seating is rather straight up and not overly comfortable.

The olive and rosemary appetizer was amazing sounding but it was lacking any form of olive flavor. The olives were extremely hot initially and lacked olive flavor as a result. Once cooled down I had no olive flavor and mostly rosemary flavor, not necessarily a good thing as the two flavors combined aren't overly complimentary.

Had the tuna tartare appetizer - girlfriend is gluten free and couldn't try the sweetened sesame crisp that produced some complimenting flavor with the tartare. The tartare itself was lacking in flavor. The creme fraud he was so mild in taste you needed more than was offered with the plate to really taste it. Jalapeño pesto had some flavor but again needed a bit more than was available.

The French onion soup was good, however, the cheese balled up in to a giant cheese wad and i couldn't get it to melt apart very well so I had bites of only cheese and then sips of only soup. Maybe a wider mouth bowl would enable better ability to avoid the issue I faced but flavor was good nonetheless.

Seafood linguine - split the dish as a gluten free pasta option. The sauce was ok, again very light on flavor. The seafood that was in the dish taste nice and fresh but would have appreciated a bit sharper flavor from the dish. 

Pizza - ordered the salumeria gluten free pizza and it tasted decent given that gluten free crust isn't the easiest to make taste amazing. This item was ordered to go and not eaten until later.

Overall the price point seems a bit high for the quality of food experienced. I recognize that the price point is aligned to the area the restaurant is located but I would tell anyone seeking an Italian option to seek other restaurant choices like mora Italian, north at kierland, etc"}
{"text":"Service started off quite good - but when they got crowded - on a Tuesday night, service was too slow.  Manager apologized and bought us dessert though.  That was nice.  Food was very good - smaller size portions for Italian restaurant. The prices were above average I thought. For that price, I want to take leftovers home for another meal!  Nice place tho!"}
{"text":"Need  a new manager at Local Bistro the current one is an overpriced water boy. Without going into all the details, we asked to speak to the manager. Our waiter Tim assured us twice he had told him we wanted to speak with him., He never acknowledged us as we sat and watched him stand next to our table and putz  around with water pitchers. He literally took the time to rearrange water pitchers on a table;  then made the rounds at two tables making sure the guests had water when there was an abled bodied server willing to do the job. We waited 5 more minutes and watched him disappear into the back after filling up water glasses.  Never stopped by our table. We ended up getting our food boxed up to go, paid our $100 bill and left. By the time we got home our food was cold and basically tasteless.  If eating out with children, go elsewhere for brunch. Even if you don't have children, go elsewhere. So many other great food options with great service within the Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"I had a rocky experience with this restaurant a while ago, but they've changed management and every meal I've had since has been stellar. Great presentation, high energy crowd, awesome cocktails. I highly recommend this restaurant for its hip atmosphere and delicious food"}
{"text":"Good meal and service. Love the remodeled interior with the folding walls bringing the outside in. We had the beet and arugula salad, the onion soup, the ricotta gnocchi, the steak and frites and the dessert special, the ricotta cheesecake. Would have been a five star experience but my steak was cooked several degrees more than ordered."}
{"text":"I love Italian food and this is by far the best Italian food I've ever had. Ive been here twice so far and I LOVE their Rigatoni Alla Vodka!! I ordered it twice so far but I think it tasted better the first time. The second time it wasn't as spicy and I think that might have been why I liked it better the first time. My husband got the ribeye steak with peppercorn sauce and he loved it! It was cooked perfectly and had great flavor. I ordered the kids steak for my son and he really enjoyed it. (If you order the kids pizza for your child, its the same size as the appetizer pizza, my son could barely finish it (he had the kids pizza on our first visit). Their pizza is AMAZING (we had the one with all the meats on it and OMG the sausage is delicious!You have to try it). My son also liked the Italian donuts, me personally, its not my thing. During our second visit, there was an issue with the side of veggies I ordered. I had the lemon parm broccolini and it came out basically as blanched/steamed broccolini, we sent it back and it was fixed immediately (it has more of a fresh taste to it so if you don't like that, then I don't recommend it). The service here is great as well! Johnathon was our waiter and he was great! He even recommended a great wine for my husband called Conundrum. Sorry if this review is a bit jumbled. I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to come and to recommend. Never disappoints, so much care put into every dish.  Hand made burrata on eggplant is by far my fave dish anywhere ever .  My husband LOVES the risotto. We have our tried and true faves that are consistent but every time we try something new from the menu we are blown away by the quality and creativity and of course the taste."}
{"text":"Love this neighborhood spot! A few of my faves: roasted beets, Tuscan chopped salad, the roasted chicken on Sundays only and usually sell out so go early.  They have an awesome bar with flat screens, great happy hour too! Love that they have reverse happy hour too. Many late nights we have devoured the drunk bread (insanely good) and the drive-thru burger which is the best burger I have had! Excellent service! the brunch on the patio is perfect. Unlimited bloodys or mimosas and even Moscow mules! Try \"The Elvis\".. mascarpone stuffed French toast, pb, maple syrup, caramelized bananas & bacon"}
{"text":"The menu is great, and the portions are generous. It seems that no matter what time you go, the bar is already full - which means, to me, that this place is \"happening\".
Interesting cocktails and helpful, attentive staff - except the one time it was important! (We couldn't seem to get our waiter' attention.)
It's a bit loud in there, but if you can deal with that, it's a great, mid-priced, consistent spot to have dinner. 
I go even if I'm alone, because I love their pasta.
Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Just down for the weekend and we wanted a place with endless mimosa! This place is amazing! The food is reasonably priced and you can't beat $12 endless mimosa. The food and service is also top notch. The owner even came out and was talking to us and making sure we were doing well. I highly recommend this place! If Tim is working I would recommend him, he is very attentive and friendly!"}
{"text":"ood is decent but management attitude is atrocious. They feel they are doing you a favor by allowing you to eat here. Close friends who live nearby and visited at least weekly were told they had to leave in 45 minutes because they were seated at a 4 top after asking to be moved from a cold and drafty 2 top. Hostess and Manager told them they'd have to leave because they \"rejected\" first table. Appalling lack of customer service. They won't be around long with this type of attitude. Unfortunate because food is decent. One other negative : extremely noisy atmosphere."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite places. Food is great, atmosphere is wonderful. I went last week for happy hour and it was packed as usual. They don't allow carry out happy hour pricing, so I decided to stand and eat as I was in a hurry anyways. I went to pay and they wanted to charge me over double the pricing stated in the happy hour pricing. I simply asked the bartender to update the price and after talking to his co worker mentioned that the item was not on happy hour after I was half way through my salad."}
{"text":"Like I said previously.... I wish I didn't have to give a 1 star review again, but they legitimately don't care about the customer here. Pretty sad."}
{"text":"Here's the positives:
*Great wine selection, and reasonably priced.  They offer some unique wines, along with daily specials and don't have the 100%+ mark-up of most restaurants.  (Making dinner for two - appetizer/salad, and pasta, entree and a bottle of wine around $75.00 plus tip.)  So an affordable, nice \"date night\".
*very good food - particularly their specialties - i.e. Chicken parm is one of the BEST.  We also like the beef Carpaccio with Arugula; I saw some negative comments about it below, but my husband is a CIA trained Chef and rates this one pretty high.  Pasta dishes have always been very good.
So why 4 Stars and not 5?  Service.  While bar service is only good when management is present.  If not - you have to ask/remind the server for everything - from bread, to utensils, etc.  They never give you clean utensils for the next course, etc.  If you are going to serve the full menu at the bar, make sure your servers are trained."}
{"text":"Local Bistro isn't a new haunt for us... we go again and again, but tonight it felt like a new destination, I always judge a restaurant by the bread, and Local Bistro's bread is clearly a sign of things to come. The food is always steady here... great pizza, great steak and burgers and whoa, really amazing duck risotto.

 If you're not worried about calories or carbs, you need to have the drunken bread. It's the perfect combination of great bread, great cheese and wine...they also added an arancini appetizer with a fresh marinara, smoked mozzarella and pesto. That said, there are always a couple of really healthy fish specials. Honestly, I've never had anything here that I didn't want more of.  (Yeah, sentence ended with preposition, sorry).

The atmosphere is super cool, it's noisy in a really good way (I honestly do not want to hear what the people next to me have to say) and the clientele is sophisticated and polite. Isiah wasa  terrific server. He was gracious and  has an amazing sense of timing.

After dinner, we were visited by the chef and by Benjamin, the manager who spent a great deal of time with us, explaining the restaurant's mission.... 

If you're near Grayhawk, and you're hungry, you can't go wrong. Oh, and by the way, they make a terrific martini and the wine is very, very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"This place is eh, meh.  It's just OK.  The servers are a little snobby (I'm not sure why since yes, it's Scottsdale, but you're in a strip mall), the food is just OK, mushroom pizza was not as crispy crust as it should be, the burrata was firmer than it should be, but the mussels were flavorful.  Everything I tried, I've had better elsewhere.  I wouldn't go back.  
Tip:  Try their sister restaurant, Central Bistro in Phoenix by Camelback & 32nd St, for much, much better food and service.  This is still in a strip mall location but a better spot if you're all about delicious food.  They also do the bottomless mimosas on Sundays and a better daily happy hour from 2-6pm.  Or try Sumo Maya on Scottsdale Rd, another sister restaurant from the same owner, if you're all about the trendy scene and don't want to compromise on the food quality.  That one has Japanese & Latin fusion tapas that are delicious and a large patio + great people watching.  After having been to both of the other restaurants multiple times, I was really disappointed in Local Bistro.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that is clearly trying WAY too hard. The menu wants to cater to foodies but they can't even properly season a pork chop.  The pizza was drenched in grease and burned.  The bar lacks consistency - the margaritas were weak while other cocktails were pure alcohol. And don't even bother trying to have a conversation, it's so incredibly loud I'm impressed the waiter was able to get the orders right."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I've never ordered anything here that I didn't like. I'd suggest anything with clams, just make sure if you get takeout that they are all there. I've gotten home before & didn't have clams'"}
{"text":"I've had dinner a few times in the past year or so, and every meal has been really good and the bar area is really a must for a drink.
Today I stopped by for breakfast and while I only had a side of two poached eggs and toast, they were really good. 
Great service, unique atmosphere and really good food. Even my simple breakfast today was way above average. If I could give it more than 5 stars I would!"}
{"text":"Been here for a month, and have dined out 6-8 times.  Best dinner yet. 
Service was good.  Wine list is ample and not a wallet-shredder on price.  Stuff across the board and a decent captain's list.  

Carpaccio and burrata appetizers were good.  Beware, the burrata is served with a hot chili sauce.  My wife ordered it and I had not read the description on the menu, so the heat caught me by surprise.  Having said that, it was very good. 

Entrees.  I had the  . . . 
Biggest.
Chicken.
Portion.
Ever.  
And it was very tasty.  Wife had the bolognese -- solid but not spectacular.  This is really only about a 4.5 star review, and the bolognese is probably what dropped it a bit, but to be candid, compared to our other dining experiences up here in North Scottsdale, this is 5 stars by comparison all day. 

Sorry -- no room for dessert.  Perhaps it was the loaf of yummy bread that they brought us out with our waters that filled me up. 

We have found our favorite place in North Scottsdale.  At least until we find our new favorite place."}
{"text":"I think I found my new favorite restaurant. I have been craving French food lately and after a quick Yelp search, I found a few restaurants nearby. Local Bistro was the closest, so my husband and I decided to give it a try. Local Bistro is located at Hayden/Thompson Peak in a shopping plaza that houses a few other restaurants so finding parking wasn't a difficult feat. As we walked up, we knew we wanted to sit on the patio which is on the small side but feels intimate and relaxing. 

Our waiter was quick to take our drink orders and bring some bread and olive oil. We took our time looking at the menu which seems extensive and filled with numerous delicious sounding options. It was hard to make a decision - I really wanted the French onion soup or a risotto or the fish of the day but in the end I chose the seafood linguini and I was not disappointed. The dish is black linguini with market seafood and a lobster bisque jus. It was heaven in a dish and I did not want to share. The shrimp was tasty, the scallops melted in my mouth, and the sauce - oh, the sauce made everything better. My husband ordered the steak frites which is a skirt steak with herb butter, fries, and a side salad. I tried a few bites of his steak in exchange for a few bites of my dish and found the steak was super tender and juicy. 

After such a wonderful meal, we decided to try the cheesecake of the day - blueberry. I wish this cheesecake was on the menu every day. It was a delicate cheesecake with blueberries baked in, fresh whipped cream and whole blueberries on top and a bit of blueberry sauce/compote on the side. It was so delicious, I can't wait to come back and try more desserts. 

Overall, I was highly impressed by not only the food (which was amazing) but the wait staff was super friendly and the service was great. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Big fan of this place. There's is so much to say and brag about this place. To keep it short.  For morning starters, in my opinion they have by far the best pancakes in town. They come in 3's and are huge. Again, they are unbelievably good. Favorite drink here is their frozen sangria(pre-made). They once had a frozen Margarita/Sangria drink but is no longer made. Favorite pizza is the meaty salumeria. Ingredients and flavors are second to none. They also have live music on Sunday."}
{"text":"I LOVE Local Bistro. I've been here twice now and both times have been pleasantly surprised with food,   cocktails, and especially the service! Each time I have had Michael as a waiter and he is phenomenal! Very attentive, welcoming, and friendly he is a wonderful addition to the experience.

The brunch options are delicious as well as their lunch items. Yummy Lobster Mac and Cheese, pizzas are great, and I love their grilled cheese! They even offer a choice of citrus with your water! I love this place!"}
{"text":"Disappointing. My wife and I went yesterday for dinner with another couple. I informed the restaurant when making the reservation through opentable that we were there to celebrate my wife's birthday. They sat us right away but there was an attitude and a sense of negativity from our server the entire night. It started with her requesting that we order the appetizer and main course at the same time. She agreed that she would manage the timing, and she did, but I thought it was an odd request. Next I ordered a beer. When she brought it to the table she said in a nasty tone, \"do you NEED me to pour it in your glass for you\". I did request the glass but I told her I would be more than happy to pour it myself. She just made us feel that she had something more important to do every time she came by. I think the final straw was when the main course was served and mine was missing. Close to 5 minutes later she brought it out and simply placed it in front of me and walked away. An apology would have been nice. I understand we all have bad days and it's quite possible she was simply having one of those. I just expected more from a place with such wonderful reviews. Oh and we didn't need a song or free dessert but a simple gesture of a birthday wish would have been nice knowing that was the reason we came in that night."}
{"text":"I want to like this place, really I do. But it has some hurdles to overcome to get that bump up to the 4th star. Went on a busy Saturday evening, had a reservation and had to wait about 20 min for our table. I give them thumbs up for handling the delay well as they offered my party wine to pass the time. I'm really mixed on the environment. Love the casual atmosphere with large industrial grade wine shelves surrounding the room and the updated blackboard specials. Did not really love high noise levels precluding normal conversation or the fact that practically everyone in the place looks like they have had plastic surgery. I might consider renaming the place the Botox Bistro. 

Wine list has plenty of options and most are affordable. Also, most are not marked up the typical 100% of other restaurants so they do get a thumbs up for making good wine accessible to the consumer. The menu is great in concept with lots of good choices for mains. The reality is that they had run out of the blackboard special by 7 pm and many of the items were heavy-handed on the salt. Tasty but with some basic flaws. 

I have to drop it down a star for the service. Our server was aloof, walked by our table numerous times without making eye contact to the point where finally we had to raise our hands and yell at him to get him to stop and take our order. There was no water refill and nonexistent wine service after the initial bringing of the bottle to the table. Yep, they were busy and it was crowded but this is the restaurant business and it was a Saturday night. Had they planned accordingly, they would have the 4 th star. Maybe next time."}
{"text":"My all time favorite spot. From drinks with friends to brunch, lunch, dinner and and dessert..."}
{"text":"I come here for happy hour few times a month-- not bad drink menu and appetizers. Have interesting pizzas to choose. Wine per glass may be a little more expensive (though there is a wine bar in the same complex in Frys that has some great wines as well). I like to sit at the bar. The bartenders are very knowledgable on drinks and mixology :) love the drunk  monkey bread!"}
{"text":"The inside is renovated with a nice dining area, patio, bar with lots of tvs. The quality goes down from here. The food is decent, and the customer service is not very good. They are often out of menu items, and they wouldn't let us sit at our reserved table 30 min early even though the dining area was one third empty. Retarded."}
{"text":"Look at me heading up to way North Scottsdale!  How very out of the box. ;)  

I came here with a friend who was checking the place out and lo and behold, I fell in love.  The menu here is very diverse offering items from  pizzas, to pastas, to larger entrees, salads, you name it.

We started with the arancini.  What's not to love about pesto and smoked mozzera deep fried and sitting in a delicious sauce?  

I opted for the pork tenderloin entrée served with a side of gorgonzola polenta. They had me at gorgonzola polenta, not gonna lie.  HOwveer it was the insanely rich sauce served with the perfectly cooked pork. Wow.  So rich.  It also came with green beans, and while they were cooked perfectly.. they are green beans on a plate with polenta and pork tenderloin covered n nectar from the gods.. let's be honest.  I ignored those beans.

My dining partner got the butternut squash ravioli with sage butter and hazelnuts.  That too was over the top declious.  I only got a teeny bite.  We were both pretty stingy and didn't really share. ;)

We had plans to order some gelato, but the manager came and offered us pannacotta.  I graciously thanked him, but my inner dialogue was cringing. I don't like pannacotta. But I tried it.  So, I like THAT pannacotta.  Most times it's this weird gelatinous blob.  this was rich adn creamy and covered with raspberries and a sauce.  Super sweet.  

We still got the gelato.  I've been to Italy. This was disappointing.  It honestly tasted like store bought hard ice cream rather than creamy rich gelato.  

One word if anyone is reading this from there.  Turn on the AC please. it was hot in there!! We were sticking to our seats.

The service was great and they also have happy hour food/drink specials.   I\"ll be returning!  EVen way up North!"}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant near Grayhawk.  How could food and service be so great after just one week.  Amazing value!  Staff is superb.  German, who owns the place, walks around and genuinely engages with his customers not in the usually patronizing or obilgatory way.  Wait staff is actually enjoyable to talk with.  This place has really figured out how to make you feel welcome.  And the food was amazing.  My only fear is that we may be going so often that we'll get burned out.  But if so, it will take a long time.  A fabulous experience in every respect.  Welcome to our neighborhood, Local Bistro.  Please stay for a long, long time."}
{"text":"This review is based on the fact that I just had dental surgery, and I am limited to eating soft foods. I was able to convince my family to go out for dinner to a place where there was good that it looked like I could eat. Fortunately, we picked well! The waiter also understood my dilemma since he knew someone who just had dental surgery. He made good recommendations for the rest of my family who could eat like normal, and for me, if I asked about a dish that looked like it might be soft, he would confirm or let me know that some parts might be difficult to eat.

We started with the handmade burrata which came with fried eggplant and a spicy tomato sauce. (I could eat this, and it was amazing). I also had the French onion soup which was very good. For dinner, I had the gnocchi. Normally, I like gnocchi in small quantities because it is so soft, but tonight it was amazing --b some of the best gnocchi I've had with truffle sauce and garlic chops (maybe the best because it wasn't yogurt or hot cereal), but it was excellent!

I plan on coming back here once I can eat normally again. There were several items I wanted to try."}
{"text":"This is one of those restaurants that every one in the valley should give at least one try.  An excellent locally owned spot, with a good modern vibe, and serves up great and fresh food.  And if you want to save some cash, there's a great $30 for $15 deal on Local Dines (https://www.localdines.com/phoenix?ref=19485).

I had the Chicken Parmigiano.  I love that Local Bistro has its own spin on such a common dish.  The chicken is flattened and breaded more like a schnitzel, covered with gruyere cheese, and a tomato ragu is served on the side.  Not only is it a tasty dish, but its nothing like the Chicken Parm you can order in any other restaurant.

The only thing that I didn't appreciate was the noise.  Wow, it is loud inside.   The tables are also a little uncomfortably close together, but you won't have to worry about any eavesdropping on you.  In fact, you'll barely be able to hear the people you're trying to listen to."}
{"text":"Back for the chicken parm. Yelp reads this enter is 21.00 but the menu now shows $24.00. 3$$ does not break the bank, but they need to update their info."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I frequently eat at Local Bistro. It is the perfect compromise for us: we always sit at the bar (where the full menu is available), he gets to watch sports in the bar area and I get to eat good food. We live in the neighborhood and it is our favorite place to stop in and have a drink close to home. The service is always great and I haven't eaten anything on the brunch or dinner menu that I have not enjoyed. See you again soon Local Bistro!"}
{"text":"We tried to have happy hour there tonight. 

Was greeted by a hostess who looked like she was afraid of her own shadow. She told us happy hour was everywhere in the restaurant, so we asked for a table. A server then had to tell the hostess that no the happy hour was only at the bar. So we said we would see if anything opened up at the bar and two seats did. Yay! We went to go sit down and the bartender wouldn't let us because a woman ALREADY sitting at the bar was  reserving these two seats which weren't even near hers. We were astonished that the bartender wouldn't let us sit down at two empty seats, that people had just gotten up from. 

We never got to eat here after being really excited to....

Has a nice atmosphere, but seems like service needs A LOT more training and could possibly ruin your meal."}
{"text":"I'm a local in the area. We spend a lot of money there as locals. Now Bill has made it clear that one of our friends cannot go there. He will lose all the locals. Sorry Bill as you are in vacation in Maui."}
{"text":"Three charming young hostesses whose combined cleavage was tantamount to the nose cone on space shuttle Atlantis, lent to the sneaking suspicion this place was going to be good. It was. 

Still reeling from titty overload after being seated, I was unable to process the menu, let alone speak to my date. Whenever this happens, I typically go hard with steak and beer...my primal resort. 
Good call. 
The steak was a NY strip smothered in a delicate peppercorn au jus gravy. It was twenty nine bucks and worth every cent. I had two IPA's and some frites to round it out.

My date, the person I can't recall being with throughout dinner, had a pasta dinner of some sort...who cares. I have a feeling her experience here was substantially different than mine.

I woke up this morning visualizing the platter of steak and gravy and NOT the titties. 
I must be getting old.
Between the tits and the steak, I've got seven reasons to go back. Eight, if my wife stays put at home."}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday dinner and loved it! The server (Anna) was great and the food/cocktails were delicious..we got a round of limoncello and Zeppoli (warm Doughnuts) for dessert and it was the perfect way to end the evening. Great atmosphere and the manager even stopped by to make sure all was well..Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Best chicken parmigiana anywhere. Nice outside seating where you can hear your groups conversation. Inside can be really loud."}
{"text":"Local has a very nice wine selection at very attractive prices."}
{"text":"Returned there a week or so ago after their recent renovation.  With the exception of the expanded patio, some design decisions seems ill-advised. Restaurant had a warmer, cozier vibe before the reno and the expanded bar area just makes it even more difficult to have a conversation without shouting.  Plus, to get to the restrooms, one has to squeeze through a very narrow aisle between the seated bar patrons and a wall...a truly idiotic design.  Neither I nor my 3 guests were too happy about the communal sink outside the unisex restrooms, either.  

Food was great...just like always!  Bolognese is the best!  Service knowledgable & friendly.  Hostesses seemed overwhelmed, but pleasant:)  

Looking forward to sitting on the new patio come cooler weather!"}
{"text":"Let me start off this review by saying this is the first time I have bothered taking the time to write a restaurant review but was so disappointed in how management handled us as regular customers that I decided to make the time.
We have been regulars at the Local Bistro since they opened. Suggesting to different friends and family that we meet regularly there for dinner and drinks. I loved the restaurant when they first opened and the staff was great. And while service had dropped off a fair bit since the renovations were done I thought we would hang in there in hopes that new staff just needed further experience.
We arrived at our reservation 25 minutes early last night. I didn't think this would be an issue that we were ahead of the rest of our group as I could see plenty of open tables in the restaurant. The hostess informed us that, No, that went against their policy to seat customers before the reservations and that would overstress the kitchen.  I told her we would happily sit at the bar just have to drink before the other couple arrived but all seats were taken and there is not very much standing room area. I added to her that I was having an issue with my back, unfortunately, I would not be able to stand for the entire 25 minutes until our reservation but if she could ask the manager if we could be seated early. I said I promise we will not order any food before our reservation time but just a drink which would've been made by the bartenders at the bar if we had stood over there anyway. 
I saw the hostess conversing with Brandon at length and he finally came over to us and said again that it was against policy to seat us early. I said I could understand that if there weren't all those empty tables there or if we didn't have a reservation but it didn't make any sense to keep us standing when I was uncomfortable and there was at least seven tables open including the one that was being kept open for our reservation. He said he would keep us in mind, that we are at the top of his \"list\" and would get us seated as soon as he was able. Five-minute stretches would go by without any new customers coming in so, again, it's not like they were having to deal with the flood of people coming in and that is why they put us on the back burner.  After 20 minutes of standing there in discomfort we left.  I told the hostess I was very disappointed in how they treated us as customers, let alone regular loyal customers
We went to another restaurant where we were treated much more graciously even though they had full tables and we didn't even have a reservation with them. When I got home and called Brandon for the email address of the owner as I thought he should know what transpired that evening, he got defensive, talked over me, and tried to say it was just a misunderstanding. He gave me the email address, giving a dramatic sigh and an Oh My Gosh! When I asked him to repeat it as I thought it sounded incorrect. I repeated the email address back to him and he gave me a curt yes. When I sent an email to that address it was returned incorrect address. Need I say more?  We will no longer be customers at the Local Bistro"}
{"text":"Finally, a fun place with great food in our Grayhawk neighborhood.  The Chef is Italian and the owner (German) is friendly and always there.  Ever since my husband and I found this place, we've become regulars, eating there twice to three times a week. 
My favorites are the two fresh pastas, but also tried one of their pizzas which is amazing.  The Mac & Cheese is also among the best in the valley.
My husband really likes the pork chop and I would also recommend their salmon.  They have several pastas, but my favorite is the fresh mushroom (I have them add chicken) in a creamy sauce.
The bartenders (Ryan & Natalie) are friendly and efficient.  
In a short 6 weeks, this place has managed a good crowd and there was a bit of wait (which I don't mind for good food) on Friday night.  Boy, I guess we'll have to start making reservations.
Last but not least, it is reasonably priced -- check out their Saturday/Sunday drink specials ;)"}
{"text":"Absolutely Fabulous! 
Amazing fresh food. 
Favorite local restaurant.
Great wines and cocktails"}
{"text":"Not rating 5 only because of noise. Food was awesome. Party of four and we had 1-Spaghetti and huge meatballs, Chicken Parm w side of spaghetti, Lobster Mac N Cheese and Prosciutto Wood fired pizza.  All dishes were Devine.  I will come again but try to around the busy hours."}
{"text":"Remodel was a great success, congrats.
Also, happy hour seating and menu greatly improved with many more menu items added. Food awesome as always!"}
{"text":"The food and service are excellent. We loved the fresh pasta dishes, especially their pasta pomodoro with shrimp. My daughter and I also liked their baked clams. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Easter Sunday after church is such a head ache. People, lines, bad service and everyone all dressed in their Sunday best  trying to be polite, uh! But this year, Local Bistro had it going on! Fantastic service, great prices, great mimosas and we were all surprised at how good the food was. Great menu, will def be back. Our entire party was very impressed.  Great job Local B!"}
{"text":"LOVE this restaurant! Great service and the food is phenomenal!! We went as a group for dinner back in March and we were treated very well by the staff and the owners (since we are concierge they wanted to make sure we trie a lot of the menu so we are able to send our guests there.) Everything from the appetizers to the main course to the desserts and wine/alcohol menu was amazing! I would definitely go back! Even though I am super picky, I would still go and eat here because the food was that good!!"}
{"text":"Brandon is a solid host, Varina excellent handling all our requests. Food top shelf. Now we need to split our PHX dinners between Central Bistro and Local Bistro."}
{"text":"A couple of coworkers took me out for lunch for my birthday and LB had good reviews so I picked this as the local. It's a very cute restaurant and we were immediately seated. Everything on their menu looked fantastic, as did their specials. We shared an order of the drunken bread which was bomb. I had the chicken ranch blt sandwich with fries, others at my table had the special salad, cobb salad, and french dip. Everyone seemed to enjoy their meals, myself included. My sandwich came with a ton of fries, I may dare to say maybe too much? But everything tasted great. One of my coworkers mentioned it was my birthday and they brought out a plate of vanilla ricotta with whipped cream which was a nice surprise. I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"The service was better on our last visit, even though the place was busy.  The expanded patio area is pleasant if a bit cramped.  No one in our group of 7 had a complaint.  Prices are typical of the North Scottsdale area.  Still a shopping mall restaurant, with no visual character or 'views' of anything, but a good choice."}
{"text":"Wow you should all know what a fantastic place this is to eat the food is unbelievable. And the waitstaff is even better than the food. If you can believe that it's true the food is absolutely fantastic I have never in my life enjoyed a dinner as much as I have for my birthday. Everyone there was so kind and wonderful I can assure you that I would always come to this place for my birthday dinner for the rest of my life."}
{"text":"Took the wife and twins for our Anniversary dinner; had heard uneven reports of the food and service, but it is nearby the house, so we decided to try it.  Started with a crisp Caesar salad, competently done but would have liked a little more of their tangy dressing. 

Then the twins got their mini-pizza with fresh mushrooms and it was excellent!  My bride had the tender filet Diane, with fresh mushroom gravy, perfect fries and yummy green beans. The steak was just perfect; it wound up in many tiny slices which were devoured by all of us.

I had the lasagna, which was the best version I'd tried in many moons. The melding of rich red and Bechamel sauces, the mixture of veal, chicken & ground beef layered in perfect pasta- oh, Yes!  The charming server brought us a chocolate lava cake with large scoop of superb natural vanilla ice cream, and two glasses of delicate champagne in honor of our celebration.

Better than we'd expected; all in all a wonderful dining experience. A special occasion kind of place. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate their last night for dinner.    This is one restaurant you can always count on for great service and great food.  Our server was Kelly and she was phenomenal, made great recommendations and was as pleasant as could be.   Nice touch when the Manager stopped by to ensure we were having a great time.   I mentioned that this was our last dinner in Phoenix due to a relo, and they brought us a free desert to say good luck..... Nice touch!

Great restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Every time we have guests in town we bring them to this restaurant.  I have brought exactly 7 different people there in the last 2 weeks.  Usually the food is delicious and today was no exception.  The problem today is that my husbands salmon plate had about 2-3 long black hairs sitting right on top of the risotto.  I understand that things like this happen but I would have expectected an apology, a glass of wine, a desert....anything to show that they were sorry for the fact that he returned his plate and I ended up sharing my pizza with him so he could eat with the rest of the group.  As a regular customer, I am disappointed."}
{"text":"Loved the decor and atmosphere. Disappointed with the food. Service was marginal. 3 of us had lunch and spent close to $100. The recommended spicy chicken sandwich was extremely dry and tasteless. The grilled ham and cheese sandwich was mostly cheese and little ham. The soup was luke warm at best. The food and service did not match the decor or the tab. Too bad."}
{"text":"Such a great place! Cute, cute restaurant, great music being played, all of our dishes were delicious and filling and our server Taylor was the absolute best and I will always ask for her when I go back (which I have already made a reservation for this upcoming Sunday). :)"}
{"text":"A little loud for my regular night out but enjoy the food, service and people watching! Their Rigatoni with Italian Sausage which was simply Devine! 

UPDATE: Ok returned many times since that first visit. And, I must say this is one of my favorite go-to's. Brandon the GM is always amazing; he greets us, welcomes us every time and makes us feel special! The hostesses have been spot on and very personable. I highly recommend the Handmade Burrata which is actually their crispy eggplant (yea yuck, right?! NO) which is to die for!!! Today our server is Nicole, a cutie with a slight Jersey accent, personable and an excellent server."}
{"text":"Wow!  We've been at the Local Bistro a few times now and have been very impressed.  The owner is very personable and often chats with his patrons.  They tend to be very busy, but we've been offered complimentary wine during our wait on more than one occasion.  My favorites are the drunken bread and the filet mignon.  It's great to be able to have a great meal and wine without trekking further south into Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Impeccable service, delectable food, sophisticated ambiance -- I love this place.

The ambiance was cool and didn't feel too trendy.  The giant chalk board behind the bar offers up a bit of personality (and informative, too!)

Alex was our server and did a great job.  He was able to give perfect reccomendations on all the wines & dishes we asked about.  We received just enough attention and never felt pestered (don't you hate those waiters who cut in during your conversations?)

The food was fantastic.  Our table started wiith the oven trio (um... can we get this in massive quantities? Delievered?  On a weekly basis?  Forever?!)  Next up, the seafood salad, chicken parmigiano and the grilled wild salmon with asparagus -- All absolutely lovely... And they aren't kidding, the \"big plates\" are BIG.
I wish  could remember what two wines my two friends had, but I was too enamored with my french martini (rasberry liquer & pinapple juice - c'est parfait!)

And finally... Oh man... Wow... The chocolate chip cookie, vanilla gelato ice cream sandwich... Served with a warm bowl of caramel, a warm bowl of chocolate and fresh cut strawberries sprinkled with powdered sugar.  I died.  HEAVENLY.  Probably the only short moments we were silent the whole evening!

All in all, everything was splendid... We can't wait for Sunday morning!!!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner.  Got seated right away.  Food was fantastic.  Home-made pasta was great. Very fresh.  A little loud cause of high ceilings but otherwise great"}
{"text":"We were looking for a great meal and read reviews and though we would try this out.  We ordered the lobster macaroni and cheese which for $28 better be amazing.  We don't have complaints, we just would not go out of our way to eat there.  I want a meal which my mouth melts thinking about eating there.  This was not that for me.  Oh well, on to another meal :)"}
{"text":"Local Bistro is a favorite. We've been eating here about once a week. The food is always fresh and excellent. Same with the service. You won't be disappointed. 

Well, last Sunday we ate at LB and there was a screw up with our food order. I always say that you can tell how great a restaurant is by how they treat you when there's a minor screw-up. Chelsea Lee is awesome. She stopped by, took care of us and we are now even bigger fans of this restaurant.  Thanks Chelsea.

Some of our favorites are:
- Crab gazpacho
- Arugula / beet salad
- Cesar salad
(salads are big)

For your entree you can't go wrong with:
- Chicken Parmigiano
- Steak Frites
- Salmon

The feature a Clark & Telephone Pinot Noir and it's not what you would expect - it's delicious.

Visit Local Bistro, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Solid restaurant.  Lots of interesting things on the menu.  Been here about three times and hadn't really had a bad dish or drink  . . . until this last time.

They have a great cocktail menu and there are a lot of good food options (the burrata and pork tenderloin standout).  Last time I went they were out of the baby back ribs so I went with the steak au poivre.  This is going to sound nuts, but the steak was way too, uh, au poivre.  Way too much pepper action.

That being said, it's a great dinner option in the area (where you don't have to break the bank).  Also, every time I've been there I haven't seen an empty table.  Be sure to make a rezzie."}
{"text":"Our favorite place by far!  Local is a North Scottsdale gem!  We eat here at least once a week of not twice.  They never disappoint."}
{"text":"I love the social hour here. I get the steak tartar with frites, flatbread, calamari, beets, drunken bread and really anything on the menu.
The martini's are fantastic and perfectly made. The service is wonderful and the bar area is large and an outside feel. 
They have a patio area to dine on the full menu. 
A great place to eat/drink before going home."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very nice and upscale urban. The wait staff was extremely friendly, knowledgeable of their menu and didn't blink with a special request. The drunk bread started us out in the right direction. The beef carpaccio was delicious but needs more parmesan crisps. The chicken parmigiano was prepared in such a way that it melted in my mouth. The fettuccine alfredo was good although somewhat generic. The arugula salad was fresh and crisp. They have a nice wine cellar. Prices weren't that bad. I will be back for more!"}
{"text":"First time dining at Local Bistro. Beautiful decor! Enjoyed Eggs Benedict for Sunday Brunch. Hard to choose which one but decided on traditional. Delicious! My friend had crab omelette and loved it as well. Mimosas were $12 with $.01 refills! Yay! Our server was very nice. Can't wait to go back for lunch or dinner :)"}
{"text":"Food is above average. Bartenders lack personality it's all about pushing drinks. They are faux friendly and can't wait for closing. Owner is wonderful staff not so much."}
{"text":"We went to Local Bistro on a Friday night. We were sat in the patio section. Service is very, very slow so be prepared for a long dinner. A member of our party sat on a chair and got gum on her pants. The manager or the server wasn't much help in assisting with the gum removal nor did they offer any type of comp item. The food was good but would probably go somewhere else the next time I am in that area."}
{"text":"I thought the food was very good. I had the burrata and it was very tasty.  While I am betting the rest of the food is excellent the jury is still out for me on the service.  I will check back in to update!"}
{"text":"Normally,  love this place when we sit at a table. The servers are great. Today we sat at the bar and, every time we sit at the bar, the bartenders are very snobby. Every other place in town, the bartenders introduce themselves and are actually nice. Here, the bartenders act like you are putting them out when you order a drink. They are very rude and condescending in their attitude. The only time they actually talk to you is when they bring your check and are working on their tip."}
{"text":"Local Bistro is a fun place to eat if you don't mind a few discordant notes.  I kept going back and forth between three and four stars when writing this review.  First, the atmosphere - Local is new, clean, open, and comfortable with a large outside dining area that is less noisy than inside.  If the weather allows, try to sit here.  But the outside is dark - virtually unlit.  Everyone was using cell phone flashlights.  Come on guys!  This is an obvious problem that you can easily fix.

The service was uniformly good, and the menu had plenty of choices including small plates/salads, which were it's strong points, but also entrees if you prefer that route.  But even in the small selection of dishes that we tried, there was one miss and one BIG MISS.  The lesser issue was the trout, which was virtually unseasoned and with a narrow burnt strip where it evidently had rested on the grill too long.  We had to ask for lemon to make it moist and tasty, but that did the trick.  The larger issue were the green beans almondine, which were raw -- not lightly cooked mind you but entirely raw.  Was this a recipe flaw or an execution mistake?  Either way, not pleasant, at least for me.

Between these issues and a pet peave of mine - Internet menus without prices - it looked like 3 stars for Local Bistro.  But then came the dessert, a surprisingly good Nutella Budino, and I leaned towards four again.  The final decisive issue was the portion size.  Local Bistro gets it right, not too small so you feel cheated, but not huge like too many restaurants today so that you eat more than you need, or even want.  Thank you for that courtesy!

I guess I'll go back.  And bring a larger flashlight."}
{"text":"Love the Happy Hour! My fav salad is the Tuscan Chicken! And that burger on HH, is to die for! Love it! Oh and I have to mention the bar tenders, they are great!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing! 
Josh was our waiter and was so courteous and attentive. We appreciated his knowledge of the menu and the drinks available. He was very kind and welcoming as well. As we were leaving we were met at the door by the manager or owner, we mentioned how great the food was and how wonderful Josh was... come to find out, it was Josh's first night working there! Seriously?! Ask for him by name. We enjoyed our experience even more because he made it great. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place and their food. Went in on a Sunday at 10:30 for my wife's birthday and the restaurant was essentially empty. The hostess said that because there were 3 parties coming in that they could not accommodate a party of 4 adults and 2 children. Pretty disappointed when we were pretty much told that we just couldn't be seated at all."}
{"text":"Chanced in to this place with some friends from out of town and it was a very happy accident (the place we were going was closed for the day). We arrived in the early afternoon and started with the bottomless Mimosas. Brilliant! Problem was we ordered a little before 2:00 as our waiter sold us on the promise of bottomless mimosas (it was a tough sell...) but then before we were even finished with our first round he returned to say they were transitioning to lunch/ happy hour/ whatever. He brought out one refill and that was the end of not-so \"bottomless\" mimosas. Not the best start. 

From there things got better. We ordered several appetizers off the now accessible happy hour menu and loved the drunk bread and beef carpaccio. The gazpacho was less successful. For entrees our friends ordered the Spanish Risotto and even the foodies they are declared it to be the best risotto they had ever had. It was pretty amazing. my fiancee and I split the Croque Monsieur which we were expecting to be basically a grilled ham and cheese - it turned out to be a second order of Drunk Bread with ham stuffed in the center. It would have been nice if the waiter had alerted us to this while we ordered as it was simply too much grease, cheese and bread - delicious as it may be. 

At the end of the day we really enjoyed ourselves, enjoyed the food and had a great time. Hard to beat that really. Further, the two big flaws in our experience stemmed from the waiter and not the establishment. We enjoyed a couple bottles of wine (great selection btw) with our meal and it came to a little over $220 for the four of us ($60 for \"bottomless\" mimosas) - not terrible but true bottomless mimosa's would have made huge strides towards making that number sit better. 

Take away: An upscale atmosphere with some truly great food and somewhat lacking wait staff (based on one visit)."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for happy hour recently. The happy hour is a fantastic deal, but it ends at 6:00pm. We ordered mussels, calamari, burrata cheese, and some drinks.  The portion sizes were very generous. For $6 we got about 2 dozen mussels.  The mussels were awesome, the cheese fabulous, I've had better calamari though. We sat at the bar and were there early, but by the time we were leaving the place was packed, with people waiting for tables. Local Bistro offers great ambiance, attentive service, great fresh food and fabulous happy hour value. My only complaint is that when we got our bill, they charged us the full price for 2 of our happy hour items, which we had to have them correct.  Overall, we had a really enjoyable experience - just check your bill carefully!"}
{"text":"Went here for happy hour (it's only in the bar and on the patio). They have half off their pizzas during hh (2:00pm-6:00pm everyday).  Pizza was great.  The strawberry Moscow mule I ordered was great too. We also got this caprese salad with peaches, it was fabulous. The owner was very friendly as well. I will be going back.  There was lots of old people there. So if you are 50 & under expect to be the youngest there."}
{"text":"On of my favorite places - love the staff - the recent remodel is great - we enjoy the bar and the food is fantastic - I have so many favorite dishes I could go every day for a week and have something different that's Delicious!  It's a local favorite and not to be missed - the Bolognese is to die for - really!"}
{"text":"I went here to have some lunch.  What I got was more than just Sunday brunch.  Great atmosphere, staff was vary courteous and attentive!  I will make it a point to return soon!"}
{"text":"Very impressed, short wait time. Nice intimate seating. Steak salad was my order steak was one of the best I every tasted or maybe body was craving protein after my workout. Wifey chicken Parma was delicious and rich to me, wifey rated it a 3.5. Soup was good would not have ordered it until our great waitress Christina brought me a sample. Great service. The waiter/ manager brought me a sample of all of the salad dressing which was a great service. Wifey ordered the dessert the gelato and cookies it was huge and on top of that the waitress took care of the dessert. We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Just finished dinner here and we were so compelled to write an immediate review. We were only staying here in Scottsdale for the weekend and only had one night to try a restaurant nearby. We ended up choosing the Local Bistro and we're so glad we did. 

When we first arrived the hostess opened the door for us which was a great way to start the evening. From the start, the service was absolutely on point and our waitress Christine with one of the best we ever had. She was super attentive, very sweet and had impeccable timing. We had great cocktails, a glass of wine and a delicious dinner. The manager even came by to see how our meal was going and brought us a free panna cotta dessert when she found out it was our first time there. 

The entire experience was wonderful and we would love to go back on our next trip. Thank you to the whole staff here for a great evening!!"}
{"text":"Yum! Definitely start with the drunk bread.  The burrata is also delicious - it was unlike anything I've ever tasted before.  I had the pork tenderloin and it was tender and flavorful. However, the potatoes and broccolini was bland. Great service!"}
{"text":"We have been twice. Both times the food has been excellent and tasty, with fresh ingredients. I have had seafood both times and been very pleased with the quality and preparation. (cioppino is very good) Reasonably friendly staff with decent service. My only complaint was that the waitress this last time really had no knowledge of the wine list and that was really a bummer."}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere... awesome food! 
Saturday and Sunday they have bottomless pit Mimosas and Bloody Mary's which just adds to the fantastic atmosphere and peaceful surroundings. The staff is nice, and dressed cute. Love that they use Tom's shoes ( proceeds from Tom's shoes go to charity).

Try the food, definitely sit outside at least once because you will see the gorgeous Arizona atmosphere, and live real life perfect weather. 

A definite gotta check this place out!"}
{"text":"Local is our go to place at work when we want a sit down lunch (aka there's an excuse to expense lunch). Food and atmosphere are great! Service is pretty meh.

I'm a creature of habit. I've only had three items here, but they're all delicious- tuna tartare, grilled cheese and the drunk bread. What's drunk bread? It's a chunk of bread served in a skillet with white wine and melted Gruyere. Carbs + melted cheese + alcohol= win. The tuna tartare is also insanely good. It super fresh tasting and comes with a slightly sweet sesame chip. Everyone else has always been happy with their meal choices at lunch. I haven't had it, but the steak frites looks amazing and gets great reviews from my co workers.

Unfortunately because I've only been here for work lunch, I've never been able to enjoy an adult beverage, but the wine selection is huge! When the weather is nice, they open up the windows to the patio bringing a bit of the outdoors in. It would be the perfect place to enjoy a drink on a lazy Sunday afternoon.

Service is kind of lacking. Last week we made a reservation and still had to wait 10 minutes to be seated. We weren't the only ones either. There were several other parties waiting when they were plenty of tables open. The wait staff is okay. Not particularly bad, but also not anything to rave about. I do like that they bring you a tray of citrus in case you want to add lemon, lime, or orange to your water. So bougy."}
{"text":"This is very weird.  When I went to find my old review tonight, so that I could update it, it had disappeared.  Has anyone else ever had a review disappear?  It was not a great one, so I wonder if they have some way to remove them, if they don't like them.  Has anyone ever experienced this before?  I am quite shocked it is gone, I can even remember everything I said.  

Anyway, on to the new review.  I will make it quick, so if it disappears again, I won't have wasted too much time.  I gave this place another chance, as it was disappointing the last time around, but it had so much potential.  Tonight at least the food was much better.  The buratta starter was amazing and huge.  A little less arugula would have been ok too.  Cheap way to make the portion look larger.  The child's size pasta was very good, and the steak frites was good as always, other than the frites, which when I always ask if they are fresh, they say yes, when in fact they are frozen.  They have some story about them being cut fresh, then frozen, but heck, isn't every potato cut fresh everywhere, even at Ore-Ida's, and then frozen?  Not sure why they think theirs are special or different, but they are not.  Frozen is frozen and they should teach the wait staff to have the correct answer.  The one snarky waiter I had last time looks like he's been promoted to manager.  He's still snarky, sarcastic and arrogant.  He may be efficient, hence his promotion, but what good is it if he has no customer service skills?  The more I think of it, his responses and attitude are disgusting.  Anyway, overall the food is good, but I think the prices are way too high for what it is.  This place is not really worthy of $12 appetizers, $18 pastas and $22-$28 mains.  There are much better places with much better service, ambience and food that are the same, or not much more, some even being less.  BUT, the biggest disappointment here every time I have come, (which is now my last) is the service.  While our waitress was very nice and knowledgeable, she was slammed and our service was extremely slow.  She had tables inside in the front, the back and on the patio.  She was running around like a chicken without a head.  The 2 bussers I saw did nothing.  And I mean nothing.  Our plates sat dirty and were not removed for what seemed like forever.  Food took a long time to arrive; even tho I asked for it to be as quick as possible and told them it was okay to bring it all at once.   We were not greeted at our table for a good 6-7 minutes, and every time she came to our table, it felt as tho we needed to speak very quickly as she was gone before we finished our sentence.  Very bad service overall.  Very short staffed it seemed.  This will be last time, even tho the food is better than I remember, but I won't accept this sort of service anymore and especially won't accept the mouth of the \"manager\", who still is nothing more than a waiter with a different shirt on."}
{"text":"We just discovered this place a few weeks ago been there a few times since and each time everything was great!  I would definitely recommend the Local Bistro for a nice dinner and cocktail!"}
{"text":"Wow! Food was awesome! Ribs were so tender! Very tough dish to get just right.. Well done chef! Rainbow trout was perfect! Thin but not dry. Our waitress was a local sweet girl who took great care of us with the most pleasant disposition! Wine list was very nice and pours were generous. Highly recommend! Also has out door seating with heaters. Lots of windows . Only down fall is..its a bit loud."}
{"text":"Quite possibly my favorite restaurant in North Scottsdale!  The decor is warm and inviting, the food is constantly delicious, the staff is friendly, and they have a decent cocktail list.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Everything I've had here is great. The service, the bread, the scallops. It's all a good choice. Go here."}
{"text":"Local Bistro definitely has a \"cool\" vibe, but luckily zero \"too cool for you\" attitude. With an accessible menu of French, Italian, and Spanish dishes, there is something for just about any palate or diet. 

*Sexy, inviting, open dining area
*Reasonable prices
*Fantastic wine, beer, and cocktail options
*Menu has a few surprises (a gorgeous bouillabaisse, pork chop in a pineapple port reduction) 
*High-quality ingredients
*Accommodating, friendly service

If I had to concoct a few criticisms (oh, such a stretch for me!), among them would be the noise level when the dining area is full, and perhaps a lack of innovation in the menu, especially in the Big Plates. That being said, if your standout is simple dishes, you'd better prepare them expertly. 

And Local Bistro, largely, does."}
{"text":"Wow, that was a great restaurant experience.  The food here is fresh and very tasty. The service was very helpful and fast... I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a great place to enjoy dinner with friends, this is the place.  Great Food, incredible service and we just had a wonderful time.  Our server, Daniel was great and took the time to understand us as friends catching up.  I will be back.  Thanks for a great time."}
{"text":"1st pizza was a salt mine.  The 2ed had no cheese or sauce and needed a steak knife to cut.  Chicken parm was so-so.  Five stars for the staff who tried to make up for the kitchens's shortcomings.  Maybe 2.5 at best.  Also small pours of wine."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here a week ago and found the food to be very good with a high degree of customer service.  The quantity of food was very large and we left full.

I knock it down from 5 stars to 4 stars because they play the music way too loud which causes everyone to have their conversations at a higher decibel level.  It's a very noisy atmosphere, although it would be a nicer place to eat if it was a little less noisy."}
{"text":"Excellent!  The service is fabulous and the food is excellent.  I had a steak that melted in my mouth.  The value was totally there along with a wonderful ambience.  I would definitely return.  Also, the Sunday brunch is great with the 1 cent mimosas!   This place will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Local Bistro had been on my list of bookmark's for a while now and I'm glad we finally remembered to check them out. 

Since I'm a points whore we made an Open Table reservation for a weekday lunch knowing fully well we probably didn't need the reservation. We arrived right on time and while the restaurant wasn't packed, it was certainly busy for a Monday at 12:45 PM.

One of the servers greeted us as we entered the restaurant and showed us to a table. Unfortunately he forgot to clear our reservation and now Open Table has us as a \"No Show\".

Our server came right by and took drink orders and told us about a couple specials and the soup of the day. We both decided on Iced Tea, my partner ordered Chicken Parmesan with a side of spaghetti and I had the Croque Monsieur with fries. The spaghetti was an upsell by the server but really wasn't necessary. The Chicken Parmesan was a double breast pounded, breaded served with a nice side of Arugula Salad. My Sandwich was pretty good, although not a true Croque Monsieur. But wait, I'm getting ahead of myself. 

At this point you may be thinking, why the three-star review? Between the reservation not being cleared, the extremely S-L-O-W service (it took at least 30 minutes for the food to come out of the kitchen) and the cold fries that came with my meal we were somewhat disappointed. Even my partner, who is very forgiving said he would just give them a three star rating. For what we spent for lunch, close to $50 with tax and tip the service and food should have been amazing, not just average.

In the end we may be back. They have a nice wine selection, the atmosphere is really cool and the location is convenient."}
{"text":"It's hard for me to really say what's wrong with local now... Its hard because one year ago this wasn't a bad place. The owner has cut corners big time and the business is suffering. 

With Spiga so close and North killing the game, don't waste your time here. Local's quality has gone down big time and the staff turnover is unbelievable. 

Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I'm from the Bay Area where restaurants are plentiful.  Surprisingly they made the best squid ink pasta I've ever had.  My brother loved their Steak & Frites which was cooked just right.

To top it off, they gave me my favorite dessert (Panna Cotta) complimentary since it was our 1st time.  Hands down the best restaurant in this plaza and we tried a few."}
{"text":"Really good spot..solid food, great staff and very cool vibe. I've had about everything on their menu and you can't go wrong. Their staple is definitely the Bolognese."}
{"text":"It was my first time there last weekend for brunch and it was pretty great! I've always heard good things about local bistro so it was nice to finally visit! The interior is beautiful, modern and clean. We sat inside but the patio looked really cute too. Our server was friendly, knowledgeable and had a good sense of humor! The menu was frustrating because there were SO many items I wanted to try! I got the \"elvis\" and it was DELICIOUS! I will definitely be back!! Thanks local bistro!"}
{"text":"Amazing food.  This is one place I truly look forward to going back to and trying something new.  I've had 3 evening meals here and everyone of them has been delicious.  Its a nice place.  Excellent service, really professional waiting staff.  Fair prices.  Tagliatelle Bolognese is amazing.  This is my experience so far."}
{"text":"Best mac and cheese I have ever had! Great place, highly recommend."}
{"text":"Taylor is awesome! Sit at the bar for amazing food, endless mimosas with fantabulous service! Seriously don't know what the bottom half of a mimosa tastes like, ha! Live music that rocks, all genres! Football, food, fantastic!"}
{"text":"I would definitiely return to this place, Monday was my first time there and the food was very good, however our service is what made it. We had a server named Danielle, she was very attentive to us, and just such a pleasant to be around with that beautiful smile. We will definitely be back again soon, keep it up :)"}
{"text":"My wife just said.... \"That's how you treat people.\"

I agree. This was our first venture to Local Bistro (LB) and we'll be back.

Great atmosphere; impeccable service from Matt and his band of teammates, to the manager who made sure we were comfortable; outstanding food.

Our 4yo had Mac and cheese + fresh berries. Extra good. My wife, mother-in-law, and I had the dip trio (the pesto made with spinach and the pequillo were delicious along with warm crispy flatbread)  to start.

Matt (our server) helped us make appropriate wine choices and never once pretended to know it all. He went for help when he didn't know everything about a wine and let us taste some wines before picking a favorite).

The wife's fish was excellent, the mil's pasta was homemade and delicious, and my pizza was warm. 

It took a bit before our food arrived.... Turns out that the fish was not cooked right so they let us know that they were remaking all of our meals to ensure freshness. We were fine with that. NOTE TO OTHER RESTAURANTS: acknowledge when something goes sideways and be honest about how you'll make up for it. Extra points.

To round out the meal they brought us 2 desserts for being first time guests and as an apology for the delay.

It is always a good feeling to have 6-star service at a 3-star price. We will be going back!"}
{"text":"Monkey bread French toast...delightfully delicious and highly recommended. Side of fruit could be improved and a little bit more colorful especially when charged $ 4.00 for it. Service was slow and just plain aloof today although we were not in a rush. However they were real busy and we just were very understanding!"}
{"text":"Went last night for a last minute Valentine's Day dinner. They were booked, but they saved us two spots at the bar. They have an extensive menu with a wide selection of pastas, pizzas, and entree items. We shared the dip trio: romesco (yum!), pesto, and a kalamata tapenade. It came with warm flat bread brushed with olive oil. We split the farm salad which was fresh and perfectly lightly dressed. At the bartender's recommendation, we shared the pappardella bolognese (housemade pasta, tomato ragu, and meat). All very good. 

We stuck to wine (had a good cab, but I can't remember which one it was), but the drink menu looked like it had some interesting concoctions. They also have brunch on weekends and for $10 you can order unlimited mimosas and bloody marys. 

The staff all seemed very friendly. We waited a while for our appetizer, but once that came, everything else had good timing. I liked the decor - huge chalkboard at the bar, brick wall, cool light fixtures. The patio also looks really nice, but they don't have heat lamps. 

I'll be back to try more!"}
{"text":"Hopped in around 4 to enjoy happy hour... The bar was full so we opted for a table in the dining room.... I dislike when happy hour is offered only at the bar. Our server Tim was nice, knowledgeable & attentive. Wines were very reasonably priced. Atmosphere was clean & approachable... Music was odd & didn't really fit with the aesthetics. Mussels, pizza, bread, local olive oil... All delicious. Overall, great experience we will be back."}
{"text":"Great little touches, including the selection of fresh fruit for your water.  Caesar salad ranked in top 3 of all time.  Nice atmosphere and great wine/cocktail menu.  Server was excellent, as well as each of our menu choices."}
{"text":"I have  been here multiple times for dinner and have enjoyed each experience. Their pizzas and pastas are outstanding.  Today I went for brunch and it was fabulous - the monkey bread french toast was delicious, and very filling!  Husband had the chicken and waffles and enjoyed it as well.  Bottomless mimosas and bloody marys (1 cent refills) are the way to go during Sunday brunch.  We brought our children, but would caution that the breakfast menu for children is non-existent (we ended up getting a belgian waffle and splitting it between the two kids).  Otherwise, a great place for dining."}
{"text":"Field goal kick...and it's good!

Came here for a low key lunch and ordered the shrimp risotto.  It wasn't extremely thick or cheesy which is good.  I'd return again to try more of their dishes!"}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed at this place. After a long drive back from the Grand Canyon, My party of 4 decided to come here for dinner after reading these great reviews. We were thirsty and starving. We should have just went to jack in the box. Let's start off with the service. We came at 8:30 and the dining room was pretty empty because it was almost closing time. You would think that because it's empty, service will be great but that was not the case. We sat down and 15 minutes passed, no waiter came by to give us water. I finally saw the host going to the kitchen and pointing at our table and our waiter finally came over 5 mins later. 

So we ordered our food and when it came, our water glass was empty but it was never refilled again. My seafood linguine was good but it didn't have any mussels in there. There was 3 clams, 2 shrimps, 1 scallops and some calarami (yes I counted them) and the portion was small. I was still hungry afterward. What pissed me off was that our waiter never came once to check on us and ask us how our food was or to give us water. We finally asked for our check and just left. 

My friend lives 5 mins away from this restaurant but I'm Not sure if I'll give this place another chance or even recommend it to her."}
{"text":"Alright, so here's how it went the first time I tried this place a few days ago: I sat at the bar, ordered the steak salad (which was VERY GOOD), then proceeded to wait AT LEAST 25 minutes. It's not like they were busy, just slow. The salad was good enough that I went back he next day and guess what? Not only did I wait another 25 minutes, but it came out wrong, so I had to wait again. Okay, I was craving a salad and was near there tonight and so I decided to pop in, watch the game and eat the steak salad - HOPING it wouldn't take forever, but nope - I waited 20 minutes before I said screw it and I cancelled the salad and walked out. I don't get it, why does it take 20+ minutes to get a salad? The only thing they're cooking on it is the steak and that takes like 5 minutes! Tonight they were a tad busier, but nothing extreme. I did see the manager apologize to the people sitting next to me for the delay on their pizza. Perhaps making people wait is part of their \"thing\",  but it's not cool. The service here is sloooow, inattentive and a couple employees I interacted with didn't seem like they wanted to be there. It's unfortunate because I do like the Osio groups restaurants, but I probably won't return to this one and if I do, I may have to call in my order the day before so it's ready on time."}
{"text":"My mother and I first went here last year and had a great time.  The food was good, and the atmosphere was appealing.

We went back tonight when she was in town and had a completely different experience.  Our server, Lexi, was great!  She was friendly and very attentive, but we were charged incorrectly for multiple items on our receipt.

My mother had the chicken added to the angel hair pomodoro but was charged an additional $2 on top of the $3 up charge due to having it be chicken breast (instead of chicken as listed on the menu).

I asked for the big classic martini (priced at $10) but requested that it be extra dirty.  I got charged an additional $5 for a Grey Goose martini when I never specified what kind of vodka I wanted.

They took the additional charges off of the bill, but this was after we asked and told them we would report the situation to the bank.  They were definitely shady about the up charges and not upfront at all.  Be sure to check your bill prior to paying."}
{"text":"Food is awesome but the last 3 times I've been in, the service has been lackluster. Seems to be a problem with front of house, kitchen & service. Waiting more than 10 mins for water after being seated is poor. Hot foods being served at all different times makes eating a meal with family or friends awkward. Who serves a pancake & doesn't bring the syrup or bacon that was ordered with??? Seriously. Management needs to take notice."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to this attractive restaurant. The first resulted in long wait, poor customer service but good food.  We went back today and it was such a disappointment.  We arrived to a virtually empty restaurant although it was 2pm.  The hostess sat us at a small two top.  We got our beverages quickly but no refills on water, no requested lemon and after 25 minutes with no sandwich, we inquired about our order. The waitress who never smiled said it was coming out...I replied it was almost 30 minutes...she gave me a rude look with rolling eyes and said \"it will be here\". We left $5 for the iced tea and left - she yelled \"have a good day ladies\" when we left.  No training in this place for customer service.  Expensive and yet absolutely no idea how to treat customers.  Won't be back!"}
{"text":"Me my wife and mother In law went here for Mother's Day and had a wonderful dinner. We got there early and sat at the bar. Chris, the bartender is awesome. Funny, great service and knows your name. They also have Kiltlifter witch is hard to find at most places. We started off with the Bruschetta witch was great as well. I had the roasted chicken and my wide and mother in law had the salmon witch was all great. To top it all off he included a cheese cake for my mother in law for Mother's Day witch was a nice touch. The ambiance and lighting are always great and like all the locals that frequent the place regularly. Very happy that this place is in my neighborhood and recommend this place all of the time."}
{"text":"Always have a great meal here. Drunken bread is very decadent but I like knowing it's there if I want it! Chopped salad was crisp and refreshing.  Patio can be hot during lunch so be mindful of the suns location. Nice wine list, attentive staff. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Spectacular service, great atmosphere, and a wonderful menu.  Servers, by and large, are well trained and near sommelier-like with their wine pairing abilities.  If you order an appetizer with your cocktail or meal the Drunk Bread, with or without prosciutto, is a hidden gem: simple ingredients combined together perfectly, each enhancing the other.  Thus far all entrees that have been tried are delicious, from the pork loin (a pineapple port glaze that has to be tasted to be believed) to the Spanish risotto (a truly staggering variety of seafood is involved).  Top that off with a complimentary homemade panacotta for first time guests and one of the delectable cocktails put together by the house mixologist and you have the perfect recipe for an evening with friends or a romantic assignation."}
{"text":"Fantastic experience!!  Thank you Dave, Brittani, and  our attentive blonde waitress who has worked at Local Bistro for almost two years ( apologies for not getting her name) for making this a great meal!!  The cocktails were well balanced!  The drunk bread was a unique appetizer.  We loved the grilled peach salad with prosciutto.  The wine list was varied and reasonable.  All recommendations were spot on.  The New York strip was generously portioned and seasoned to perfection.  Great dinner. In a fun atmosphere.  We will be back!!"}
{"text":"What a joy it was to dine here. The mix of casual-trendy atmosphere, perfect lighting, cordial service and spectacular menu makes this restaurant one of my favorites in Scottsdale. To do this place justice, I have to break down my meal:

Appetizer: Two words: \"drunken bread\". My work colleagues were raving about it even before we sat at our table. And they were right. A piece of bread soaked in wine and topped with melted gruyere cheese. Order many, you'll be fighting over them.

Main: Decided to go classic and order the chicken parmigiana with a side of roasted vegetables. I was shocked by the amount of food I got. Literally the largest (see photo), juiciest and most fulfilling piece of poultry I have had in recent memory. Definitely in Yelp memory.

Dessert: Chocolate lava cake met our expectations. But the tiramisu far exceeded them. It was as creamy and as layer-y as your heart desires.

Distinguishing factor: the drunken bread for sure. And the portions."}
{"text":"We had a nice evening. I had a burger, my friends had pasta dishes. The food and drinks were prepared well. The restaurant was busy but not crowded. Noise level is loud. Atmosphere is comfortable. This appears to be a very popular local restaurant. I would come back for the food."}
{"text":"First, I will start by stating that the pizza (to go) was actually good.  Unfortunately, it was quite the wait and when I went for a slice on the way home, I realized it was cold and must have been sitting for a while before they brought it out.  Nevertheless, the wait was amusing, as I probably watched at least 3 different table drill into the manager for poor service/food.  That guy took a beating!  Good atmosphere,  just looked poorly staffed/managed."}
{"text":"Excellent food, drinks, service, and ambience. I have not been let down by a dish yet. If you've never been here, I'd highly recommend that you try it. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Came on a busy Friday night. All the extras were great: the waitress, the focaccia bread with flavored butter, good drinks, free DD drink, seated within manageable amount of time, and great atmosphere. 
The app we got drunk bread was relish and the desserts were amazing: Nutella mousse, pan a cotta, & tiramisu! 
Sadly, the entrees were not worth it. I had the such heavy dressing on my salad it was limp lettuce steak salad. Friends had the pork entre which was the best. Other friend had Bolognese and the meatball was the only good part of the homemade yet undercooked pasta dish. Last friend got pork rigatoni and it was tasty but overly salty.  

I say skip the entrees. you can't nail salad and pasta as a chef?
 you only can eat here if you're willing to shell out $30 a plate for the fancy entree."}
{"text":"The chef here makes great dishes. Everything here is ultra-mega-awesome.

The food has so much flavor and inspiration I want to go back but I live sooo faaar awaaay."}
{"text":"I took my friend here for brunch for her birthday. Plus they had unlimited mimosas. Lol

I ordered the wild mushroom omelette. This comes with mushrooms, white wine cream sauce, Gruyere and a side of potatoes. They weren't kidding about wild mushrooms. Because this was smothered in mushrooms. I think they went overboard with it and should've added more veggies. However it white wine cream sauce was excellent. The unlimited mimosas is quite a steal. $12 on Sundays with penny refills. Unfortunately I only made it to three. Lol

Our waitress was very attentive and always made sure we were taken care of. I loved the ambience of the restaurant. I felt like I wasn't even in Arizona. It felt like a restaurant I would find in la. I'd like to come back to try their dinner menu but it's quite a drive for me."}
{"text":"Their wine list is very reasonable and they even have a \"sale\" board which changes based off inventory.  They are a 90% from scratch kitchen and you could really taste that \"just made\" quality in the food.  We ordered a side of the saffron risotto as an appetizer and it was perfectly cooked - creamy and delicious.  I ordered the chicken parmesean with the chicken grilled as opposed to fried.  It arrived perfectly cooked, moist and delicious with a wonderful maranara sauce on the side and an arugula salad.  Yum!  My husband ordered the pork chop which again was wonderfully prepared with the exception of the sauce which was too sweet for me and had a slight burnt taste.  Great experience overall for food and service. We'll go back for sure"}
{"text":"We love going to Local Bistro every time we're in town. The food is delicious. My favorite is the salmon however, my coworkers got the strip that was aged for fifty days and said it was unreal. It's not on the menu but the meat and cheese platter is phenomenal."}
{"text":"Ok this local bistro is really local for me, about a block from my house.  I had been there once before for lunch a year ago and it was ok---never went back until today for lunch with my same friend.  We both ordered the chicken club pannini with fries..it was 10 bucks!!  I knew I was going to bring home half for my husband for dinner so ordered it.  The sandwich was huge---a very big piece of grilled chicken, bacon delish, french fries awesome,....only ate 6 or so....maybe a few more, the portions were huge.  Anyway really appreciated the value because last week went to Delux and the sandwiches are around 10 but the fries are extra.  Staff was very friendly and courteous---will be trying dinner soon and of course as soon as it is lighter later will be going to happy hour when it is safe to walk home!"}
{"text":"We were at Local Bistro last night.  Yes very good.  We found it very reasonably priced for the quality of food. We will surely return. Excellent carppachio.
Eric or waiter was on top of things and made my experience better.  I had him pick my entrée and he chose the double pork chop. I was not at all disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!!
had my best omelet ever!!!! eggs on skillets are even better! bottomless Bloody Mary and Mimosas!
highly recommend!!! yummy !!!"}
{"text":"Fabulous food! Every time we go there the food has been nothing short of perfection. My favorite is the chicken. Not sure how they get the skin crispy like that but it's magic in my mouth. 

They also bring a little tray of limes, oranges and lemons to add to your glass of water. NICE TOUCH!

The owner is also very knowledgeable about the wines."}
{"text":"Really love this restaurant each time more.  Thank goodness it's in the neighborhood. Wine list is fabulous too.   I didn't \"love\" my choice today for dinner but it's a solid appetizer. I just wasn't paying attention it had chorizo in it and I didn't feel like that with my shrimp.  However for the description I believe it was excellent.  Service was fabulous and very welcoming group of staff. Definitely try it out."}
{"text":"We recently held an event at Local Bistro and having lived in Arizona since 1988 I have come across very few spots where the owner and the employees were as gracious and as generous as the folks here.  The food and wine were wonderful and the service was excellent! They have an extensive well thought out wine selection in a cool laid back style.  Go for the food but know the people here are amazing!"}
{"text":"Great spot with interesting food drinks very attentive friendly staff. They have a great happy hour and the chef and bartenders really know what they are doing. Nice atmosphere relaxing in a nice shopping center with other places to see."}
{"text":"Took my mother here for her birthday dinner and it was great. Food, atmosphere, drinks, all good! A little noisey at peak time but still very good. Loved it when they opened the doors from the dining room onto the outside seating area. Can wait to go back again."}
{"text":"The food is never disappointing. From the calamari, to the brunch omelets, to the drunk bread, to beef carpaccio, to the risotto, to the pizzas...such a great place. Happy Hour is great. The staff is friendly. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The first time I went here, it was a solid four-star experience. We've been a handful of times since then and it's progressively gone down hill. 

The things that made it four-star the first time around: service and quality of food. 

Things that have not gone so well since then: 
Tried brunch- service was terrible and it wasn't busy. Coffees and waters went empty for a long time and the food took forever to arrive. When it finally did, two of the five dishes were ice cold. Ice cold eggs benedict is pretty disgusting. We sent them back, which I'm not a fan of doing, but cold, jiggly food gets my gag reflex. They basically made new benedict and threw the old potatoes back on...because they were now cold. 
Tried dinner two more times: service definitely better than brunch, quality of food still not up to par. Everything was served warm enough, it just didn't have near the flavors of our first experience. Feels like the quality of ingredients has dropped and they've changed some items on the menu that we loved and replaced them with dishes that are more on par with typical bar food. 

Bottom line- too many great restaurants up here. Probably going to be a while before we try it again."}
{"text":"I am giving a 4 star to the food. If it was based on service, it would be anything from a 1 star to a 3 star depending on which time I went.

I am obsessed with their chicken club sandwich, it is so good! I only wish it was on their dinner menu so I could get it more often. I have been here quite a few times for lunch and only once for dinner. Good selection on both. I want to go back to try some more of their pasta options for dinner, there were so many that sounded good I wanted to get a whole buffet!

They have brunch on the weekend, I am not crazy about their breakfast foods - they sound great, but I haven't been overly impressed. But it is a brunch menu so you can get some of their lunch items as well. Plus they have bottomless mimosas which are always a bonus!

It's a pretty cool atmosphere, all the walls are lined with their wine selection and chalk boards featuring specials."}
{"text":"I am usually a 5 or 1 star yelper!
I truly was irritated by the wait and lack of food I was able to order and not order because I got there around 1:45 they have just started to run out of options. 

The server put her strongest effort, I was very happy with her and her effort of trying to make the situation better. 

Toward the end I about had it with not being able to keep the patients due to being accompanied by my 3 -5 year old children, I had walked up to the front and stood there for at least ten minutes. 

The server came out with our last order, she automatically knew I was at my limit when she walked out and I asked her if I can get it wrapped up , she sent the manager out the manager was a gentleman he came out he was very professional he handled the situation appropriately, once he came out with my items to go I asked him who was all standing by the bar? Since I was waiting for ten minutes I wanted him to know I was unhappy nobody came up to the front to assist me, 
 I thought the girl in the blue was just a hostess but i came to find out she was one of the evening managers, he said  lthe manager and a few servers were standing by the bar as I was stNding at the front, I told him it was absolutely unfair unappropriate that I stud there for a good 10 minutes without the other manager or servers noticing I was standing there waiting to be helped!

The gentleman who was the manager on duty  that unfortunately had to deal with this busy day did a wonderful job,  he made the situation better but I did give him a lot of advice of what I noticed as another business owner and that things he can bring up in a situation when they have a team meeting!

At the end of the situation I'm happy with how hard the server tried to make the service 100% and how the manager handled the situation,
 however I do feel bad that everybody suffered at the restaurant due to lack of ordering or preparation for the day! 

I hope she got the $20 tip I left her, I will be back bc this is my first unpleasant situation. I live in the neighborhood and I'm always looking for a good spot to have a good brunch. 

I only hope that this post helps the managers and owners put in a good team effort for the whole restaurant!"}
{"text":"Great Sunday brunch! m?Many options including bottomless mimosas or bloody Mary's. Loved the atmosphere and live music!"}
{"text":"I had brunch hear to start with a couple of months ago and boy was I impressed. I had the Crouque Madame , the bread was crunchy and stuffed with lots of ham and bubbling  gruyere cheese served in a piping hot cast iron skillet. It was a bit heavy, but its a must try. I do suggest sharing. My husband had the burger, he said it was in his top 5....pretty darn close to a Fleming's  burger. The burger was served on a toasted brioche bun and was perfectly seasoned. The burger came with fresh cut bistro frites or fries. Ketchup isn't nesassary. The all you can drink mimosas and food was so yummy we can't wait to take more people."}
{"text":"This was a lucky find from Yelp. We were visiting from out of town and wanted an Italian place that wasn't too pricey.

We lucked out with friendly staff and tasty food. Happy plates all around.

Luckily, we had a reservation as waits were 30-45 minutes. We were seated on time and were greeted by the manager and the servers. Service was professional and timely.

We had the fried calamari and two salads (Caesar and arugula) . The calamari was not rubbery and the dipping sauce was great.

For meals, we had the trout special, bolognese pasta, and a pizza. Everyone enjoyed their dishes.

Worth going to next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"This is our first time here. Absolutely awesome. Verianna is great. Linguine & clams traditional white wine sauce is phenomenonal. Brandon,  the manager comes to every table to say hi. Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"Local Bistro: Shamelessly our Sunday Spot every week!

Bottomless Mimosas for $12, outstanding Eggs Benedict and great Service. We sit in Tim's section every time and the entire staff knows us and is very welcoming. We have celebrated multiple Birthdays, Mothers Day, Easter, and Sunday Brunch here dozens and dozens of times. 
Never even tried the lunch or dinner menu due to being so in love with the Brunch menu, but intend to... From the Monkey Bread Toast, Eggs Benedict, Omelettes and Italian Toast- we've tried it all and love every dish. 
Cute modern decor, happy atmosphere and easy to find location. We highly recommend Local Bistro!"}
{"text":"This place was great! Friendly staff, good food, nice atmosphere & well put together menu. Came for brunch but will definitely be back for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had a reservation for this restaurant on a Thursday night. When we arrived we got our requested table on the patio. We were glad that we had a reservation because the place was packed. Food and wine were very good. The service was attentive. 
If you are not familiar with the area the restaurant is not that easy to find. The car navigation system as well as Google Maps point you into the general vicinity, but not directly to the place. We also did not like that they allowed a dog into the restaurant (indoors) that was laying under the table and was fed by its owners. It was not a service dog."}
{"text":"Brunch on Sunday with my friends......amazing.  Food was delicious and the bottomless mimosas......yummy.  Service was great.  Going back next month."}
{"text":"This is one of the most service oriented restaurants I've been to! We got to the restaurant for an 8 o'clock reservation and they were packed. We still only had to wait about ten minutes, but the manager and our server came by just as we were seated and apologized for the wait with a round of drinks. Our server was Alexia, and she was a rockstar! She had some great recommendations and even offered some accommodations to diet restrictions. The food was incredible! I'm just sad I couldn't eat more. Next time we're in Scottsdale, we will definitely be back!"}
