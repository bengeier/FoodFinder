{"text":"Attentive staff, quick service, tasty food, interesting menu options, reasonably priced.  Could be more authentically flavored.  I would return."}
{"text":"Really enjoy their chicken biryani, butter chicken and naan.  Portions arn't that big, but the taste is great.  My wife and I enjoy indian food at home, so we don't eat out at Indian restaurants since we find our home made food to be better, however in the Yonge and Sheppard area, this place makes great Indian food.  I would recommend to everyone, including those that eat indian food often at home!"}
{"text":"This place has great specials. I came here once for a regular meal, and a second time for the Thursday night special - $4 beer + $0.50 indian-style wings. The wings were tasty - meaty with great flavour. I prefer more spice when eating Indian and asked for hot sauce on the side. It was flavourful but still didn't provide me with the extra kick i was looking for. The other dishes are flavourful and the meat is tender. The service was great -- if you live around the area you should definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"I have walked past this place a few times since I work close by, a friend and I decided we would give the place a try. Atmosphere is quite nice when you walk in, the dinning area larger than expected. They also have a few TVs around the room playing the game, which is nice if you're a hockey fan like I am.

The food was amazing!! I'm usually quite picky about my indian food and a lot of places don't seem to get it right, but this place had great food! We ordered the lamb sliders after reading the all the good reviews about it and it did not disappoint! It was delicious lamb meat wrapped up in a naan, makes me hungry just thinking about it! We also got the butter chicken poutine, which was alright, but I probably wouldn't order it again since there were so many better things on the menu. Also got the grilled jumbo shrimp special which was $1 each with the purchase of a drink. Man those were some good shrimp! The spices on them were quite delicious, something I would definitely go back for.

We also ordered the chicken biryani, chicken tikka masala with naans and the seekh kebobs, all of them exceeded our expectations. In the end our bill was quite reasonable for all the food we ordered. The service was a bit slow at first, but got better throughout our meal.

I really liked this place and would definitely recommend it! I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, a bit of a wait but worth the wait. Very friendly staff. Recommend the masala fish and chips, chicken tikka masala, lamb chops, garlic balls, grilled food, chicken biriyani because that's all I've tasted so far. Delicious! Can't wait to go back and try the rest!"}
{"text":"The food here is very much laughable compared to numerous of other Indian restaurants in the city. Sure inside is very modern, but no one's there for the decor. People who are not used to indian food could find this place good, but those who know indian food won't step feet inside. They also include gratuity themselves for 4 people - what. the. heck. 
Will not come back unless the city ever goes blackout and by some miracle this is the only restaurant in ontario that has lights."}
{"text":"Their $1 shrimp is a joke. I went there once and I'll not return again. Me and a few of my friends were looking for indian food in the area and it came up. This place is so overrated.  We went to their $1 shrimp day and oh my... it was so tiny there's no difference from the frozen shrimp i can get from walmart and they were so salty. The food portion was small too. Not impressed."}
{"text":"Love the interior. Very clean and modern. Food portions were wonderful and flavourful. The staff was attentive and discreet. The owner even came by our table to make sure that all was fine. Enjoyed my meal and would go back again. My recommendations are the garlic balls and chicken vindaloo."}
{"text":"Garlic balls,bombay chicken,saffron chicken even yhe garlic naan was fresh n out of the world...we love going there...5 star n more for service too :)"}
{"text":"Food was very tasty, but service was awful. I had to go into the kitchen to find the chit-chatting waiters, and get them to bring us more water and the rice that we had ordered but hadn't come with the mains. I may try take-out next time."}
{"text":"Good food, great service, don't understand why it's always empty. Must try the butter garlic Naan and butter chicken. The Tikka Masala was also very good..."}
{"text":"Not upto the mark. To put in one word, average food, arrogant servers. Not going here anymore :-0"}
{"text":"The butter chicken is one of the best in the GTA. The staff are friendly and fast. They could definitely add more options. But overall it's a great Indian restaurant to depend on."}
{"text":"We went on Saturday night, after reading reviews on Yelp and in the Toronto Star.  We ordered the garlic balls, dal, chana masala, and chicken tikka masala.  The garlic balls were amazing.  They tasted kind of like a pakora that had been rolled in a delicious sauce.  The dal and chana were very well seasoned, and pleasantly spicy (nice heat, but you could still taste the flavours).  I did not try the chicken, but my husband felt that the chicken was fine, but that the vegetarian dishes were standouts.

Service was very attentive, and very friendly.  We had a ton of food, and took home enough leftovers fro two big lunches, and the bill was less than $50.  We will definetly be returning!"}
{"text":"Excellent butter chicken. Have been here with one guest and have also brought many for a birthday gathering. In all cases the food had been delicious and everyone had enjoyed it.  Service is variable and it has been cold on a few occasions so we're trying takeout today.  I did do a survey on one visit so I'm optimistic that they'll work out some of the issues.

P.S.  takeout was yummy!"}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely amazing! Second time I've been here. I love Indian food, and they make amazing dishes. Ordered the Tikka Masala and it was incredible! The only downside with this place both times I've been here is the service. There is a lot to be desired, especially if you're not in the mood to linger foreeevver! But the food is incredible."}
{"text":"The food was tasty but average. That said it was more than we expected for Yonge & Sheppard on the foodie meter lol. We had the garlic naan bread(good), coconut curry chicken (delicious!), butter chicken (good), the mojito (not so good but ok. Tasted more like a vodka tonic) and Hakka noodles ( bad - smooshy and lacking in flavour. Do not get the Hakka noodles). The owner alfie (or we're assuming he's the owner) was super nice and gave us a complimentary drink the next time we come back. DJ on thurs nights and free poutine with a beer or something like that :)"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and absolutely delicious food. We loved the mixed grill sizzler and the garlic balls. Lovely ambience, very relaxed. The service was a little slow, so I would come here if I had an evening where I wanted to enjoy with friends and eat amazing delicious cuisine!"}
{"text":"Good food. Naan bread could be old but they make a new one IF asked.

Average service. Not very customer oriented management. Glasses can be dirty, they change it IF asked.

Songs are very loud. Need to change some decoration.

If you are just looking for good indian food and not so concerned about service, I should say Nawab would be a good place."}
{"text":"I can't believe this place is back! Some of you may have loved their previous locations in Streetsville and Thornhill which closed a while back. 

Loved all the dishes we ordered but would highly recommend their Saffron sauce dishes. This is hands down one of the best Indian dishes ever!

Service was a bit slow tonight but the staff was apologetic. BUT it's absolutely worth the wait!!!!"}
{"text":"Great takeout curries - try a vindaloo or masala with rice to go.  Good quantity and substantial flavour, although a bit pricey!"}
{"text":"Very tasty food, good sized portion at a reasonable price for Indian Food.  The service was excellent as well."}
{"text":"I had this place on my bookmarks for quite some time before I stumbled across its location on a sunday afternoon walk.

From recommendations we chose a couple of dishes and to share everything (my boyfriend and I) We had the poutine, lamb sliders and byriani, everything was lovely although we were slightly dissapointed as everything came at different times, our byriani arrived some 20 mins after everything else so we were to full and took it home as a doggy bag.

Staff are friendly enough but nothing special. 

Its worth a visit to try the fusion take on things but I dont think I will return in a hurry."}
{"text":"Ok,

So, I felt like playing ping pong, drove to Estrella (the old Smokey Joe's) near Yonge and Sheppard...and I wanted to eat something.

I used to live in the area for 2 years, and know for an emprical fact you have good people and things to do in the area.....but every single restaurant in the area - sucks

So, after playing ping pong, I walk in here.

It is EMPTY.  Not a single person in the whole restaurant, except the owner.  Bad sign.

Nothing to lose (nothing in the area that is worth eating, I lived here and checked under every rock), so I sit down, and order.

The food comes out actually very good.  There are some fake pseudo names to foods to make foreign food easier to understand.   Pakoras are now named \"Poppers\", Daal is explained as Lentils, and Chana Masala is now flavoured chick peas.  But if you know what you are doing, you can work backwards and order what you need :) 

Ate the Bombay Curry (which tasted exactly like a good Karaih Curry), and shish kebabs which was pretty good too.

Overall, I remember NOT writing about Bombay Grill (because I used to have to get takeout somewhere) and you can't write bad about somewhere you eat!  

So, I would say give it a shot if you are in the area.  You have no other choices unfortunately :( 

The person who served me Ali (I think) was outstanding customer service.  I had to personally tell him to keep his business going.  People will come.

Should be a solid 4 star, but gave it a 5.  It defies all logic of Yonge and Shep and actually gives you a decent meal.

Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"*Takeout Food Only*

I have not dined in so can't comment on the service, but the food...OH MY THE FOOD!

So, as a caveat, the types of food I love aren't very \"traditional\" but whatevs, because those Garlic Balls are AMAZING! It's got the crisp outer layer with a soft interior and before I knew it, I had 6 of them! My husband and I usually order two plates of these because on our walk home, we always finish one on the way!

The Mumbai wings were also really good too; the meat was perfectly fried.

The Nawab Saag is great with rice (Spinach) as well as the Chicken Tika Masala with that rich tomato sauce. 

If you ever feel like not cooking and having a totally satisfying meal, I would recommend all the dishes above. We always finish between 2 people.

It doesn't take long to get your food...we placed an order then went grocery shopping...the food was done within 20 minutes.

I would love to dine in one time, but the place is kind of dark. Because we live so close, we always do take out...4 times already!"}
{"text":"I was fortunate enough to be invited to their grand opening several months ago, and then when Imran N planned a UYE here back in October I got to re-sample a large portion of their menu to be 100% on my thoughts. Overall pretty good, with a few mishaps but overall worth the visit if you've never had Indian Fusion cuisine before.

It's a smaller location, but well laid out, near the Shepperd and Yonge area in North York. This location is the relaunch of this international brand after two previously mismanaged locations in Thornhill and Mississauga failed. The true visionary (Alfie) behind bringing Nawab back to Toronto is a generous and kind business man who knows exactly what it takes to make this business work. 

Here is a run down of what we got to eat and my thoughts on each as we tried them:

- Nawab Garlic Balls - pretty good, very nice flavour

- Mumbai Lollipop - very similar to a chicken wing with Indian flavour

- Green Poutine - Not very good, this dish is Indian trying too hard to be North American cusiine, the general concensus with our group was that this dish was lost on us, not a real fit

- Pulled Lamb Slider - it was mostly bread and is less a slider and more a pulled lamb naan sandwich. Good taste overall.

- Seekh Kabob Beef - this dish was a major fail, it needs to be reworked. Extremely dry and over cooked

- Channa Masala - this was a good dish, I enjoyed the flavour on this

- Saffron Chicken - This was their signature dish that they pride themselves on, it's similar to butter chicken but with a healthier take. I enjoy this, would definitely come back for this

- Gulub Jamun - a very sweet dessert but most folks in our group loved this, I could eat one but more than that and I'd be in a sugar come ha ha

I'll likely return when in the area and perhaps with a larger portion I'll be able to properly rate/improve their review rating. 

Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"Considering I've never sat down for a traditional Indian meal, I was very impressed with all the flavours. The garlic balls were awesome, the wife and I REALLY enjoyed the lollipop chicken could not stay on the plate long enough and the saffron chicken/masala w. rice were the straw that broke the camels back. In regards to assuring that you are not leaving this quaint and personable restaurant REMOTELY hungry. My wife and I will definitely be back with the family and will highly recommend this place to all who wish a tastey yet traditional twist of Indian food. Oh! by the way come hungry!"}
{"text":"Met up with my girls for lunch on a beautiful Thursday.  For the busy area they had a few parking spots behind the restaurant for free (score)! There wasn't many people inside but didn't bother me. We were sat by the window on a high table. By checking in on yelp we got a free butter chicken poutine. It was great. They even gave extra sauce on the side to put on your fries. We ordered the bollywood Blitz sangria and it was nice and tangy. Would recommend that for sure. We all ordered the lunch special. It came with a creamy tomato sauce with poppadoms inside. Perfect level of cream and not overly rich. The meal comes in a cute bento box. I upgraded my samosa to the garlic balls for an extra dollar. It was very moist. It had an interesting taste. Not something I loved or hated. I got the Bombay chicken which is a bit more spicy. It had a good level of spice and not too creamy. I tried my friend's saffron chicken and I liked that more. It also comes with a salad, white rice, naan, and a couple pieces of mango. I think next time I'll upgrade to the garlic naan. It was a great meal. The service was a little slow for the amount of people in there but they were very nice. I would come back again for sure."}
{"text":"This place is really good.
For starter's we had the Nawab Garlic Balls. looks like meat ball, and i thought it's gonna be something like a falafel, turns out to be a ball of mixture of vegetables. taste pretty good and really moist, completely different from it's look.
The Chicken wings lollipops was really crispy, the lamb sliders was really great too. 

the NAAN is the best. 

Check out their menu and hours on their website!
(as their lunch hours are short and the lunch menu is more extensive.)

oh oh oh, don't forget their dessert, it's sooo good that I had two. (someone had three...)"}
{"text":"I personally don't like giving a one star rating but I think this place is overrated and my experience was not good in all areas. I was in the area so I decided to give this place a try since the rating was not that bad. First, my impression of the place when I first walked in was that it looked like a grungy bar in the west end (no offense). I was expecting bikers to walk in at any point in time, so no points for decor. They sat us down right away in a dark corner. We looked at the menu for a few minutes and wanted to order and we had a few questions. We were just here to eat and leave and weren't here to socialize with our friends, but no one came to our table and didn't seem to acknowledge our existence. We finally got someone's attention where we had to literally scream at someone to get some service, cause they all seem to be running away from us, perhaps they were busy and understaffed? No excuses! 

We ordered the meal for two people and I highly don't reccommend it because it's not really the deal that you think it is. Our waiter was not knowledgable and was constantly confused about their restaurant menu. He didn't know what the chef's appetizer was today. But we were fine and just wanted our food. The meal makes you order a chicken entree and a veggie entree. So we ordered butter chicken and saffron vegetables. The saffron sounded really good because it said it had cashews in the sauce. 

So when our appetizers came, we had already waited for more than 20 mins since we ordered. They were these four tiny triangles (samosas) and the skin didn't have the consistency that I was used to. Maybe they were more healthy but at that point I didn't care, I was HUNGRY!!!. We had to wait another 20 minutes for our entrees to come, seriously? Do I really think that they were making our food from scratch? Because it would have taken the same amount of time. So our two entrees came with rice and naan. The rice was fine nothing special just plain rice. The naan came cold! I thought this stuff was supposed to be fresh. The butter chicken was okay, tasted more like tomato sauce chicken, no butter. The saffron vegetables was a big disappointment, it was full of the what looked like frozen vegetables, beans, peas, corn and the little bits of carrots. There might have been one piece of paneer in there. The saffron sauce didn't taste like it had much cashews in it, it didn't have the nutty taste or the gritty consistency. It was terrible even the generic Compliments butter chicken sauce you get in a jar at Metro tastes better. I had a hard time scoffing it down with some cold naan. At this point, when I thought there was only two waiters working their butts off the \"owner\" came and asked us how our food was and proceeded to tell us how they use this healthy style of cooking to make their foods. If this style consists of removing the main ingredients of your dishes like butter and cashews then you have succeeded! He was being all fake and all and I hated it, I'm like no BS pls. Where were you when we were waiting for our waiter and our food? You could have made yourself useful and made some samosas or something, (or maybe he was, if so I apologize but still one star). 

Overall it was a bad experience for me, if what they meant by fusion is to take out good quality ingredients and replace with bland foods then I am not okay with that."}
{"text":"A great variety on the menu, the portions were a good size and had some great flavor. 
We tried several items (and ended up having way too much!) And we plan on going back for more... 

The service did leave a little to be desired. Not bad service,  But certainly not the friendliest."}
{"text":"Trying not to die from diabetic shock from the many... Syrup dough ball desserts I had. 

Food was amazing, the service was even better. We came for Imran's UYE and had an incredible meal for a great price. Highlights were the garlic balls, chicken lollipops, the vegan channa masala made for my lacto-intolerant face and the desserts, which were heavenly. 

Everything was wonderfully flavoured and incredibly textured. What was supposed to be crispy was crispy, what was supposed to be soft was soft. Nothing was chewy, soggy or bland. The beef kebabs were a but dry, but everything else was perfect. Can't wait to go back!! 

Also, Team Imran and Abbas need to throw more UYEs."}
{"text":"Not too say that i was dissatisfied with this place; as food was ok. However I feel that it was bland in comparison to a lot of indian chains.

They never had some of the beer on tap; excusable but then their domestic beer tasted watered down. I ordered the mixed grill (surf and turf); which had chicken/beef kebabs ; tandoori chicken , and lamb chops. The highlight was definitely the Tandoori Lamb chops; if I do ever go back, it would be for the that. Everything else was pretty generic. 

Ordered the cheese naan for $4 ; felt let down as the item did not have the value. Thin naan with cheese in between. There are several other indian places in the neighbourhood with a lot more flavor. 

Strange that fellow Yelpers are so amazed with this place. They probably never got food in gerrard or even silver spoon."}
{"text":"In terms of quality, this place is above average. I came here for dinner. I usually get Indian food for lunch because they have lunch specials/buffets. My experience with Indian food is that their lunch prices are highly reasonable, but their dinner prices can be steep. But it makes sense that their dinner quality is higher. 

We had the choose your plate dinner thing. We got a chicken and a calamari, both with sauces whose names always escape me. One was spicy and one was savory. The food took a while to cook but this is how I know it's being made rather than just being picked and heated from left over lunch buffets like some other restuarants I've tried. 

I think Indian restaurants generally make great date places with their exotic interior and unique music in the background. Nawab is also fairly exotic but it seems more geared towards young people. 

My only real complaint are the prices. Yonge/Sheppard area isn't cheap I know...but I don't think it's too much to ask to have rice/noodle/pita included when your main courses are around $12-15. We had plain noodles and they cost an additional $5. Not worth it imo. I'm used to ordering an extra bowl of rice for $1.5-$2 at most. My experiences with Indian food is that you MUST order rice or noodle as it's the only reasonable way to enjoy it. There is a lot of sauce and you need the rice/noodles/pita to soak up the sauce. 

Overall a good meal but I think I can find less pricey options for the same quality."}
{"text":"I went here for an \"Unofficial Yelp event\", which is basically just a bunch of people (30+) getting together for a meal at a slightly discounted price.  This place is conveniently located across from the North York Civic Centre and the interior has a nice urban vibe to it with a couple of large tv's.   It is more an \"pub feel\" to Indian food.  

Appetizers: 
a)Nawab Veg balls: these were delicious.  There were lots of nice herbs in there.
b)Green Poutine: I'm not a big fan of fries, but they were nice and crispy with good flavour.
c) Lolipop Chicken: this was probably my favourite of the night.  The chicken was very tender and it was like a mix of tandoori and chilli chicken (but a lot less spicy) on a little skewer
d)Beef Seekh kebob: To be perfectly honest, while I know the chef tried hard to cook well for 30 people, I think he tried too hard and over-cooked these. The meat was kind of tough.  

However, I thought most of the apps were delicious - so for the apps, probably 4/5. 

Dinner: 
a)Saffron Chicken - like a sweet butter chicken.  It was white meat and some of tablemates didn't like it that much, but I thought it was pretty good.  
b)Lamb Slider - the lamb inside was very well cooked, however I think the naan bread needed a bit of work.  I'm not sure but it wasn't as \"hot\" as I like it.
c)Channa Masala - this was actually my favourite entree. Thought this was amazing channa.  
d) Rice - very fragrant
e)Plain and whole wheat naan - naan was okay, but I've had better.

So for entrees I would give this place a 3/5

So in essence, this gives the place a score of 3.5/5.  However, I'll round up to 4 stars because the owner and servers are all very pleasant and accommodating.  

Oh yeah, and I had a fresh lime juice.  MY GAWD! this was off the hook (yes I know, no one says that anymore, sue me).  It basically tasted like a mojito but virgin.  SUPERB!


If you work or live in the area, I would say this is a great place to have business lunches or drinks and apps after work."}
{"text":"We visited this restaurant yesterday and ate Paneer tikka masala, Vegetarian Biryani with Naan and whole wheat roti, it tasted good. The owner an ismaili whose parents are from Dar-es-Salaam was very warm and welcoming, although the ambiance of the restaurant needed to be upgraded, but still worth recommending a visit for tasty food."}
{"text":"From my only visit...
Pross first: The place is clean and waiters are polite... polite but not professional! 
Cons: we were a group of 20 colleagues went to Nawab for a leaving lunch do. reservation was made days in advance, so they must have been expecting a large group. The food arrived at our table after approximately 50 solid minutes of wait. nothing was offered in compensation. we had to ask to be compensated. My dish was extremely salty. I got few other colleagues to taste it to make sure it's not just me tasting so much salt in this food! they all agreed, so I sent the food back. I did not ask for a replacement but i was \"offered\" another dish, and as we were already very late to get back to work the waiter offered to have it boxed to take away with me. Once we asked for the bill i was surprised to see that I was charged for what normally would be offered as free food, as a sign of apologies for their disastrous service. I refused to pay and they kindly accepted it, but I shall never go back to this place. 
NOT RECOMMENDED!"}
{"text":"We have been here a few times and love their vegetarian menu. Veg tikka masala, baingan bharta and daal are extremely delicious. Also love their naans. Food prices are quite reasonable. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Sorry it took so long for my review, but here goes...

I LOVED Nawab. My brother and I hosted a UYE here way way back in October for about 40 lucky people, and boy was it a blast!

Its located right next to North York Centre, or across from Mel Lastman Square, so the location is pretty great!

(I'd come here if I was all businessing it up in the area, I hear they have great lunch specials!)

(Yes, I just made up the word businessing. #DealWithIt yo)

The restaurant was a lot bigger than I though it would be, which was pretty awesome. There is two seating areas with different levels, which I really thought was cool.

The owner Alfie was super nice, and did a great job hosting us!

So on to the food, which we did sharing stylezz

Apps:

1. Nawab Veg Balls- these were awesome. I didn't think I could like veg ballz so much, but damn, it was good. The sauce they were dipped in was so creamy and nutty, it was amazing. These are a DEFINITE must HAVE. :)

2. The Chicken Lollipops were FANTASTIC. They tasted just like how I used to love them growing up...how come we don't see them around that much at other restaurants? Its basically an indian chicken wing, but they prep it so its like a little drumette lollipop. Delicious.

3. The Green Poutine : I actually missed this one because I was too busy walking around..

4. The Seekh Kebab : A lot of people though this was dry, but I reall enjoyed it. I just guess I ain't never met a seekhie I didn't like!


Mains:

1. DAT LAMB SLIDERZ THOUGH. Pulled lamb wrapped up in a crispy naan..this is what I was waiting for before coming here. I LOVED IT. Sidenote: I actually missed this one, but Alfie was super gracious enough to make me one seperately during the end. LOVED IT + Worth the wait.

2. The Saffron Chicken : This was awesome. It's like a creamier, less tomatoey version of Butter Chicken, and I really liked it. It's an interesting take, and I'd love to try that again.

3. Channa Masala - it was pretty standard fare, I didn't have more than a bite b/c man's didn't wanna get too gassy/also I was pretty stuffed by this point!


Desert :

Gulab Jamun - yummy and fresh and hot and yummy and gulaby :)

(gulab means rose, so..rosey)


Drinks:

I got to try the Paan Mojito which sounded great in theorry, but could've used mint + paan leaves, instead of just the paan.

Also had the drink with rose syrup, tonic and gin I think, that was AMAZING. Like a classier Rooh Afza, if you know what that is :)


I love this place! Thank you to Nawab for hosting us, and I will defo be back soon!"}
{"text":"After reading good recommendation from Yelp, off we go to Nawab!. We arrived relatively early on Friday evening and restaurant was relatively quiet. Service was prompt, friendly and helpful.

So why the two stars? Value and food. My benchmark to any ala-carte Indian restaurant would be if it's any better than buffet Indian restaurant (in which you're paying a lot less for more) and the answer for Nawab is no. I found that the food is just average and all of the dishes we ordered (Vindaloo lamb, Rogan Josh lamb, tomato chicken?) was lacking of kick/texture and the amount of meat contained is surprisingly scarce. The garlic naan we ordered was also slightly burnt (Although was enjoyable overall). 

Overall we spent $60+ for 3 meat dishes, 1 appetizer and 3 garlic naan which I found to be on the expensive spectrum and a terrible value for the food quality they serve."}
{"text":"Love the Butter Chicken Poutine. Amazing food & nice people. Free Parking is a nice touch considering it's location. I had been to the old location in Thornhill and looks like they have all those specialties and more fusion dishes. I definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Just went there last week with wifey...

A very tasty variation on Indian cuisine. All dishes we tried were bold and flavourful. Portions were generous. Spiciness level was perfect. Everything was fresh and each bite was heavenly.

The cocktails were also unique, refreshing and reasonably priced.

Servers were friendly and knowledgeable.  Service was prompt.

There are many Indian restaurants that are worth a visit. Believe me when I say, I have visited many since 1993. Nawab is definitely worthy of many more visits.

Only critique was that the outdoor area and entry needed a little TLC. Other than that, a 5-star experience. Oh! wifey agrees..."}
{"text":"Four of us plus a toddler went to Nawab a few weeks ago. It is nice that they have their own parking lot around back (maybe 6 spots) and they let us leave out the back door (instead of walking all the way around from the front) because it was a freezing cold night. The music they were playing was good and the waiters were very patient with our group, which was great.

The place is kinda dark and has a black decor which is ok. They have several TVs showing sports (not good in my books) so I'm not sure what they are going for, are they an Indian fusion sports bar? The food was good overall, even the poutine, we thought it was tasty. Our friends said the food wasn't as good as the Thornhill (?) location, which I understand is closed.  The service was definitely sincere and quick. The restaurant isn't very cozy so I don't think I would go back given the other options available in the area."}
{"text":"We came here with my wife's old co-worker Faisal and his wife Corinne a while back and it was a great experience.  We decided to meet my cousin and his wife because they wanted to try out the restaurant.

I had made reservations for 7 PM over the phone.  When we got there, it was half empty and we were seated inside.  Our waitress was very helpful, nice and easy to deal with.  We went through the extensive menu and they had a lot of choices.  Famished we ordered a slew of grub.  Check out the photos!  Garlic Balls, Bombay Lollipops, Chicken Biryani, Butter Chicken, Garlic Naan and not pictured, Lamb Rogan Josh.

The Garlic Balls were incredible and we had to order a second.  They were moist, crispy, soft, all in one shot, an ultimate combination.  Yummy balls!  The Bombay Lollipops were delicious.  They were also crispy, fun to eat and had excellent flavour.  Take the foiled up bone and just rotate it through your teeth and chow down on the meat.  Awesomeness!

The biryani, butter chicken, naan and lamb were pretty good.  Loved all the fixings and went really well together.  I couldn't get enough of it.  It was great to have a variety of dry and saucy to mix together.

I would definitely return to this restaurant.  I know that the place itself had a conditional pass in previous months and is a bit pricey but it's okay once in a while.  We enjoyed ourselves and loved the variety.  We also had left-overs which was great too.  Superb!"}

{"text":"They serve the best Gulab jamun I've ever had. Maybe it's simply that I've never had it served warm before, but Nawab is on to something with these syrup-covered dumplings of delight. I had three so I should know.

Other highlights were the buttery garlic naan bread, Newab garlic balls (could have eaten a meal of these) and the saffron chicken. All excellent! Service was great considering the crowd and I plan to return soon!"}
{"text":"I reviewed the dishes in the individual pictures. The rating it has is I feel accurate. The place itself is classy but cold by the windows in the winter. The music wasn't too loud and the service was pretty good. The poutine was mediocre even though it sounded awesome. The lamb was good but it was pretty fatty. The chicken was decent but nothing crazy. 
It's a bit pricey but a decent meal, don't expect to have your socks blown off."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre. However, for a party of 2 they cheat people by adding gratuity on the bill. Nothing on the website or the menu says that they'd charge gratuity. I will never go back there again because they pulled this cheap stunt on me."}
{"text":"Came here for an opening party and loved all the food. It's in the old space of Bombay Behl and I personally welcome this place over the BB. The restaurant is a chain with previous locations in miss and thornhill. The concept originates from dubai with another store in uganda. 

Got to try various dishes like vindaloo lamb sliders, tikka paneer, chicken lollipops, etc. I only have compliments about their food. Their drinks were excellent too - their bombay mojito is genius - paan leaves instead of mint leaves. So smart!

I will definitely be coming back here again (and maybe again) and will post a review when i go in as an actual guest."}
{"text":"Great food, great staff. Grilled calamari is amazing. Weird indian tab beer but worth the try. Recommend to anyone who like indian or not actually."}
{"text":"I thought it was going to be an underwhelming experience but if it was pretty good. 
If you go, you must eat the Garlic Balls. I'm still thinking about them."}
{"text":"Food is good, staff are really nice. Portions are pretty big, maybe even hard to finish.

Few times I've been there, the service was pretty slow. It takes more than 20 minutes to get your food. But the quality evens that out. So if you are not too much in rush, give it a try."}
{"text":"After I checked in on Yelp, I was offered one free app when I purchase one app. However, the store owner said it's only applicable to drinks and not an app (quite confused).

Second of all, on every table they had a Halloween prix fixe menu. But apparently it's only available on Oct 30th and 31st, but the date is not mentioned on the special menu. Why even have it on the table if it's not available...beats me!

Overall, the garlic balls we got we're flavorful and delicious, especially the chutney that came with it. The fish and chips was alright, but I wouldn't order it again. The saffron chicken was quite good with tender white meats but lacked saffron. The plain rice was pillowy and the plain naan had a great flakey exterior and soft interior.

I might come back, even though there were rough patches to the service/offers."}
{"text":"I think the word \"Fusion\" in their name might be referring to the food being dulled down to the 'white' palate. You go in expecting Indian food but you find half Indian, half Jack Astor's. I didn't like the poutines at all. The channa masala and saffron chicken were ok but again both lacked flavour. There were a couple of positives among items I sampled though. For example, the lollipop chicken wings were pretty darn good. The mango lassi and the rose water cocktail were awesome. If I'm around this place, I might walk in just for those drinks. And the gulab jamun was one of my favourites."}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to try out a quite a few of Nawab Fusion Grill's offerings.

If you are looking for authentic Indian food, you might be disappointed but if you just want to have \"fusion\" Indian food, Nawab is not a bad option.

Nawab Garlic Balls - good
Mumbai Lollipop - good, great pub food
Green Poutine - ok
Pulled Lamb Slider - meh, a small spoon of lamb sandwich between 2 burnt naan bread
Seekh Kabob Beef - super dry and crumbly
Chana Malsa (curried chickpea) - good
Saffron Chicken - meh, not much flavour and super dry
Gulab jamun - good

Nawab trying to be a \"Gastropub\" really have to work on it's drink menu and add a little more \"spice\" and \"flavour\" to their food. It does have potential to be a great place for a drink and a snack after work!

{"text":"Great spot for lunch with good portions and yummy food. Lots of space, courteous staff, and quick service make this a solid option."}
