{"text":"My friends order takeout from this place regularly, and I'm never disappointed. I especially like the tofu with spicy salt, the spinach and garlic ha gow, the steamed bean curd skin with seaweed, the vegetable dumplings, and the radish cakes. If you order nothing else, order those radish cakes. They're like little pan-fried squares of stuffing. So good.   The food is a little oily, but no moreso than what you'd get at other dim sum places. If oil irritates you, though, keep that in mind."}
{"text":"As far as delivery dim sum goes, this place rocks!  I ordered the har gow, steamed bean curd wrap, sticky rice in lotus leaf, hot & sour soup, stuffed mashed taro and curry chicken, and spicy salt fried squid.  Everything came up to about $28 + tips. The food is really yummy, fresh and excellent value for what you pay. The service was super friendly and quick. Their menu is a welcomed addition to our delivery drawer."}
{"text":"Needed a quick lunch in the area so I tried this place.  Really not impressed.  What I ordered was about as basic as you could get, BBQ pork egg foo yung on rice.  But there are way too many onions, and why would you put carrots into the egg?  All the flavours were wrong, the rice was soggy, there was very little BBQ pork, and the egg had too much salt in it."}
{"text":"We ordered some take out for a family get together and were pleased with the service.  Did not take very long.  Store is very clean. Staff was friendly, and helpful,  explained some menu items to us. Food was very good, portion sizes were okay too.  The ha gow was superb.  The chef must be experienced and seems to know what he's doing. Rice cooked perfectly for our taste.  We also tried the ribs and shrimp  and they were pretty tasty. The seasoning was right on, not crazy salty.  It's a welcome addition to the neighbourhood, adding to the variety of foods in the area.  Found the prices to be pretty reasonable."}
{"text":"What a fantastic dim sum experience on the East Side of Toronto. This ain't Chinatown but for it to be open on New Year's Day, I certainly won't complain.  I am not as well versed in Chinese food, generally because I often don't seek it. Coming to Ha Gow has influenced me to make Chinese a more sought after cuisine type and I look forward to finding some great dim sum in Chicago and in New York.  As far as the restaurant, it's kind of a divey spot and a little cramped. The waitress will bring you a menu and a card so you can write down which types of dim sum you plan on ordering. Specials can be found on either the placard above the counter where you pay or along the walls.  Tempted by the pan fried beef short ribs at a cheap price point of $4.95, I ordered a small order of that, followed by a sampler of dim sum which was well priced at $12.95 for four different varieties. Everything was absolutely delicious. The banana leaf-wrapped rice and shrimp was a nice contrast to the salty and fatty pork and beef focused dim sum.  If you're in the Danforth area, you will have plenty of options to seek (Greek, Yemeni, Italian, etc.) but this spot is great if you're looking to eat a lot for a little."}
{"text":"I read the reviews on this place and was reluctant to visit.  Knowing there's not too many places in Toronto that offer dim sum all day, and this restaurant was the only dim sum place near my house, I was hoping my visit here would not be in vain. And they did not disappoint! I found the food to be extremely fresh even though we arrived 40 minutes before closing.  We ordered almost 1/2 the menu so we could taste test everything and we enjoyed every single dish.  The staff was courteous, and cared about our opinion of the food, asking us multiple times if we were enjoying our dinner.  Prices were very reasonable.  We had a great experience and I would not hesitate to go back to Har Gow!"}
{"text":"Our monthly dim sum group visited here in August.  Ha Gow turned out to be a very good dim sum place. Small, diner-ish atmosphere, very casual. It is clearly a neighbourhood favourite. We had: - steamed pork sui mai (though it has shrimp, which was not stated on the menu) - good; - steamed spinach shrimp and garlic dumplings (very good); - deep fried taro with curry (the \"birds nest\" looking dumpling, the curry was flavourful without being biting spicy) - good; - steamed pork buns - good; - pan fried bean curd roll with veggies - very good, veggies were crispy and abundant.  The two disappointments were: - pan fried green onion pancake - thick, greasy, tough, not like the yummy pancakes we've had at other dim sum restos. - they didn't have any mango pudding that day [[sad face]]  - the red bean sesame balls got a split decision - some liked them (crunchy shell with flavourful paste inside), one thought the crunchy outer shell was too tough.  We came away full but not stuffed at $11/person. So conveniently located, it is well worth another visit."}
{"text":"One of our 'go-to' take out spots in Riverdale.  Although I have to say that their ginger beef has changed, or I've become so used to the spectacular stuff at Danforth Dragon that I no longer appreciate Ha Gow's.  Anyway, their eggplant in spicy sauce and spinach shrimp dumplings are my favorite.  We really, really like this place.  A lot."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite Chinese restaurants in town. Simple, yummy and dependable. Love the dumplings, shrimp balls, fried rice, noodles, broccoli... Very basic eat in vibe. Self serve tea. The people working there are always nice although it is pretty minimal.  This place is a regular for our family."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Excellent dim sum.  Fresh and perfectly cooked.  Owners are fantastic and friendly.  My dishes were excellent and came quickly.  You order at the counter or at your table, fill in the menu, and voila... you are served delicious morsels of perfection.  I loved the har gow, the pan fried pork dumplings and the radish cakes.  All their sauces are excellent as well as they are all made in house as well.  It is cheap too.  I cannot find a thing wrong with this place.  You can call ahead and pick up and they will also deliver.  It is a Cash Only spot so come prepared."}
{"text":"Great authentic dim sum place. They have a good moderate selection of traditional dim sum fare."}
{"text":"This is place is great for basic dim sum items. Large portions. Best pork Sui mei on the street! I love the lotus leaf meat sticky rice!"}
{"text":"Delicious. Probably the best dim sum and fried wontons I have ever had. I order from them on a weekly basis it's that good."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to give this place a try for lunch since it was nearby. An impromptu lunch with our two infants and two strollers - Aaaah..that is the life. Surprisingly, there was enough space in this resto for two strollers and the owner/staff did not appear annoyed that we took over half of the restaurant for two customers.   For drinks, they have a self serve water/tea station which is great. No waiting. Just do it yourself.  We ordered a couple of the standard dim sum dishes: Har Gow (steamed shrimp dumplings, Siew Mai (steamed pork dumplings), steamed beef tripe, and curry octopus.  Although this place is by no means the best dim sum that we have ever had in our life, it was tasty and good.  The price was also reasonable (approx. $10 per person).   As others have said, service is fast and friendly and it is a small family run resto.  We would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Found a bug in my hot and sour soup from here the other day.  It was some kind of caterpillar/larvae thing, about an inch long.  I know it probably happens all the time with restaurants,  but I don't think I could eat their food again without gagging at the memory of fishing that bug out of my soup, knowing I'd already eaten most of the meal... bleh."}
{"text":"Like all other Chinese restaurants, i won't count on the service and environment. But their food quality Is far below average. Ordered 4dishes. I mean even a kitchen beginner can do this.  The outer of green dumpling is too sticky. They steamed it for too long. For The sticky chicken(?), just a mix of sticky rice and chicken.  The eggplant, I didn't even finish.  The bean curd. all I feel is starch."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic place to get veggie dim sum on the Danforth! The pan fried veggie dumplings, broccoli and saut√©ed eggplant are my go-tos!"}
{"text":"As some people may have pointed out this is not 5-Star rave about how good the food is kinda restaurant. It good to decent Cantonese food.   I respect the fact that everything is made fresh and in house, even the most of the sauces. I love the helpful of the staff and the flexibility of the chef to accommodate individual customer's food quirks (no MSG, only veggies, noodle soups with no soup? 3x the normal spice) while not giving in to the ridiculous demands of other customers (half and half rice/noodles on an already low priced lunch special).   I may not like everything they have to offer but I like that the chef refuses to sell me items based on the fact that he can't find quality produce to make that certain item (taro or even rice noodles sometimes).   There are some flaws like how they run out of sauces sometimes (plum, chili oil, and hot mustard). Or that they forget stuff in orders. Which I can't blame them when sometimes they seem very overworked for a group of 4-5 and I can see 5-6 tickets full or food orders. They always make the effort to right their wrong by offering free w/e you missed out on last time.   I like that fact that they walk over to the Only One Cafe and Bar to deliver food for patrons not eating in.   In summary I think this place is great not for the food which don't get me wrong is still pretty good but for the attitude to welcome customers and make them feel welcomed. They are helpful and relatively quick. So for a lowish cost and a quick bite this is the place to go. Enjoy the free tea and the great staff especially the guy who works Tues-Friday mornings."}
{"text":"Came across this place by chance. The food was quite good. The BBQ pork buns were very good and the baby bok Choy. Loved the sesame balls and the siu Mai. No ambiance at all but the food was tasty."}
{"text":"I just need to write this update and rave about this place, because I hope they do well so I never have to find another quality dim sum place in Toronto again. This is the only place in Toronto that my husband and I will come for dim sum now, even though it is out of the way for us to come here. The har gows and sticky rices are always consistently good, so fresh , so hot. Also, the owners are super nice, my husband and I cycle a lot and some times we come here after our cycling sessions, we obviously would not be carrying our bike locks and they are always super accommodating by letting us keep our bikes in the store, so we can eat in peace.   The food always comes out pipping hot, which I love, lukewarm dim sum is a a huge pet peeve of mine. They steam everything to order. I don't mind that I have to get my own tea and napkins infront, I actually prefer it some times, because I drink so much tea that waiting for a refill is a pain in most places. Also you have to drop your order form off infront, which again I don't mind because the prices they charge are soo reasonable for the quality of food.  Stand out dishes for me here are:  Har Gows: The skin is not too thick and has elasticity (hate mushy har gow skins). you can see the shrimp through the skin, which is basically a mark of quality and skill. The shrimp is always clean and well seasoned.  Sticky Rice : The sticky rice in lotus leaves actually has a alot of meat and is moist.  Spinach and garlic Har Gow: OMG I love this dish, it is bigger than the standard har gows and wrapped differently but soooo good, the skin has spinach leaves in it too. I love garlicy things and this definitely has ample garlic.  All the other dishes are great too but those 3 stand out and we always order them, my husband loves the fried tofu with spicy salt and the steamed bean curd with meat rolls.  Anyways, love this place, keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner today after reading about it in the comments on a post on BlogTo. Did not disappoint! Service was fast and friendly and the food was delicious! We ordered several different varieties of dim sum including the shrimp har gow, beef sui mai, mushroom stuffed with shrimp as well as the beef short ribs and fried wontons. The food arrived quickly and tasted super fresh! Overall a great experience and will definitely be back. Just a note, it's a cash only place but please don't let that stop you from trying out this great place!"}
{"text":"How unexpected, when it was suggested to me we go for Dim Sum on the Danforth I thought people were crazy.  I have to say I was very pleasantly surprised. The setting while very, very low key was a very familiar look. Melamine tabletops, very little in d√©cor, captain's galley kitchen. I'm sure it sounds odd but the sterile space was somewhat reassuring. My first thought was the food must really speak..  It did!!  The food was fabulous, much on par and considerably better than most in old Chinatown. I would consider starting with the fried shrimp ball... fantastic."}
{"text":"Wow! And to think we were the only people in the joint on a Saturday morning.  Well, lucky us, because everything (and I mean everything) was awesome.  Staff were friendly, food was fresh to order and delicious.  All of the staples were there and I couldn't ask for a better experience at this price and location."}
{"text":"So amazing.  The food is made fresh to order and is so so good.  I especially love the pan fried dumplings, spinach and garlic dumpling and hor fun."}
{"text":"What a treat it was to find this genuine diamond of dim sum...You will enjoy it as much as I enjoyed posting this stellar review.  The sweet lady that serves and the gentlemen that prepare the dishes are a fine example of what culinary arts means..."}
{"text":"Wow, what a surprise! Who would have thought that such tasty Chinese treats could be found along The Danforth? Great dumplings and noodles at very reasonable prices. Who needs the crowds of Chinatown?!"}
{"text":"I didn't expect too much from the look of the restaurant, but OMG the food here is amazing. We ordered maybe a dozen or so different dishes for 4 of us and everything was delicious. Shrimp ha gow and shrimp and spinach dumplings were exceptional. Fresh, juicy and plump. I really liked deep fried tofu that was perfectly crispy outside and moist inside. Price is reasonable. Glad we don't have to travel all the way to Markham for good dim sum. Just became my favourite place for dim sum in Toronto! I took off one star because it's cash only (7 eleven with Scotia ATM across the street) and the service and the decor can be improved."}
{"text":"Ha gow has slipped into that abyss where they used to be great and now just don't care and hope u don't notice.    Ha gow.  Small tiny shrimp paste together with too thick noodle   Sticky rice under cooked tasted like glue rice  Bean curd roll. Very off. Too much bamboo shoots that gives u that poo taste.   Cantonese chow mein. Ok noodles crispy. But then 2 small cocktail shrimp. No scallops. 2 pieces of rubbery calamari, one piece of slice roast pork.  Then a smattering of carrots onions and broccoli. (Where's the bloody Chinese broccoli). Not good. No taste.  And a quarter of mushroom ?   Won ton soup.  Bland and noodles in it 3 won tons. Had to add soya and ginger at home to give it life.   What happened?   And I didn't review everything.  Back to china town.   Get it together.  Stop delivering and concentrate on ur food."}
{"text":"Dim Sum is definitely 4.5, excellent taste and I highly recommend the Steamed Bean Curd Skin Roll/Meat with Japanese mushroom and the steamed spare ribs. The reason why I have not rated it a 5 Star is because of the ambiance. It's a little small and a cash only establishment. Otherwise, you can't go wrong with the food."}
{"text":"This is the only dim sum place on the Danforth as far as I know so no competition for them to excel in what they provide and can charge $1-2 more than average. The dim sum was unremarkable and service was what you would expect from an asian restaurant. I still prefer going to Chinatown for a better selection and a little cheaper for the same quality. Also what peeved me was they didn't have certain items ready when they first opened (e.g. steamed rice rolls or radish cake). Either inform the guests before they order or come in earlier to prepare so everything is available when the doors open. It's just common sense which they are lacking.  If you ever have to wait for a table, it's not worth your time."}
{"text":"Found this place in Yelp and it  was awesome!!!  S5 spicy shrimp with salt excellent.  Dim sum all very fresh, fast, and cheap.  Went again today but they are closed Monday's.  Bummer.  Leaving toronto today and hitting ktown on the way out."}
{"text":"had the ha gow, lotus leaf rice and steamed bbq pork buns. agreed with others, definitely no frills. good for a quick dim sum fix without going to Chinatown. definitely will try their non dim sum dishes in the future"}
{"text":"Speaking as a mere gweilo, this has got to be the best dim sum in town! The honest but cheerful cafeteria ambience (tea on tap!) lets the food speak for itself. And speak it does, in connoisseur-cantonese. Steam rising off the signature har gow is the curtain rising on a cast of dim sum characters, that enter stage right, in deliciously familiar clouds of moist heat. Taro chicken, shiu mai, shao mai, pai gwat, chun guun and so much more. Yum sing I say to you! Yum yum!"}
{"text":"A good friend suggested this place for Dim Sum close to her office so I agreed to go. Despite it being in the Danforth and couldn't possibly compare to the places in Chinatown, right? Boy was I wrong! Sure, you have to hand in your order form and get your tea and hot sauce yourself (bonus, each table has spicy hot mustard, a must for dim sum if you ask me) but it was well worth it.  Har Gow - the skin was slightly thicker than I'm used to but the filling was generous and spot on, not too much filler. The skin has just the right amount of chew and wasn't mushy. Which is great.  Shu Mai - tasty. And pretty perfect  Black bean steamed pork ribs - not too fatty and had the perfect blend of bone to meat.   Cantonese Chow Mein - the only miss. The noodles were not cooked well and the veggie/meat mix was bland and just blah. Not worth it and will not order again.  All in all, a nice experience and is quite closer to my office than Chinatown is for a quick pop in for lunch."}
{"text":"If you are looking for piping hot Dim Sum with fast service this is the place.  It is super low frills, so if you want decor and ambiance, this is not the place for you.  There is a bit of self serve with the condiments and tea as well which is why I only gave 4 stars.  It certainly gets 5 for the Dim Sum.  I will certainly eat here again."}
{"text":"Not authentic dim sum but the food taste was okay. Some of the dishes were oily. The customer service was good and the atmosphere was okay."}
{"text":"Everything is made to order and everythign tasted great. The pan fried turnip cake is amazing so is the steam rice noodle. Service was friendly. Came all the way here to have dim sum and it did not disappoint, dimsum in this place is way better than nyc."}
{"text":"Great place - CASH ONLY. We have loved coming here since we moved into the neighbourhood ( or ordering take out / delivery ).  Try the usual... Our favourite steamed tofu skin rolls, peppered beef, Shiu Mai and Har Gow.   The owner or manager on site is super friendly."}
{"text":"this place is a HOT MESS, seriously I don't think they know how to function properly unless you're just ordering off just-eat  We placed an order over the phone which was very difficult as the person was clearly new (not blaming her for anything) it took many times repeating the same thing over and over while she looked it up on the menu.   Eventually, we went over to pick it up, and this is where the real issue was. The little guy there with an attitude problem was super confused and asked for my name (which I never gave or was asked when ordering) when I said I never left a name he rudely asked what my order was ( I ordered about 10 items which i cant recall off the top of my head) Any ways, he was just rude about everything   here is the best part  THEY DON'T HAVE A DEBIT OR CREDIT MACHINE  I asked If i could use a visa and he just pointed to a sign that said CASH ONLY, he then told me to go to 7/11 to use an ATM....great like I want to pay a $3.00 ATM service fee .....  so I left, and we were just going to ditch the whole order and go to mcdonalds but It was closed so we ended up going back  My bf went in this time, because I was stressed out over the way we were treated and what not...He then came out of the place AS STRESSED OUT AS I WAS  the little guy at the front seriously has no business working with the public and has no idea what customer service is all about, saying your so busy isn't really a good excuse and maybe its not the best time to be training someone on a Saturday evening during dinner rush,   I suggest you avoid this hot mess restaurant with bad customer service and 1920's payment system  If you order then do it over just eat which is clearly the only way they know how to do any business"}
{"text":"Dim Sum is divine.  But sometimes, you just don't have time for the crowds and the carts and the schlepping off to the nearest Chinatown.  Enter Ha Gow - the quickest way to get your Ha Gow fix without leaving the Danforth.   The food isn't great.  Deep fried things are less artfully preprared than in your average dim sum place.  But the ha gow is decent and the fact that you can get it in the time it takes to order a pizza slice makes it a nice quick-fix alternative.    I think they should move the counter in the window back a few feet so feet can fit better over these appealing window seats."}
{"text":"Cheap and cheerful I found the service and the food pleasant and good. Its casual, prompt, self-serve tea (which I like) I liked everything I had, and not the best Dim Sum I've had in Toronto, I found this a really good experience.   I would come back here, and this is my regular Dim Sum place now."}
{"text":"This place is so authentic and deliciously good !!!!!! Found it by accident on yelp, bc I was getting sick of American/Canadian food. What a hidden gem !!! Highly recommend  driving or of the busy city and eat here ! Service is great ! Small place, but trust me !!! The dim sum comes out so fresh and hot !!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went to this place by accident and was pleasantly surprised.  It is a hole in a wall and it is at not-so-impressive part of Danforth, but all the dishes I got were extremely good.  I plan to go back and try everything else! (they don't just have dim sum)  I am quite picky with dim sum and i find a lot of places either put too much MSG or the quality of food is just general bad. But at Ha Gow Dim Sum House, this tiny restaurant, first i was surprised to see the extensive selections of dim sum, and every item was really well made (and home made). Better than a lot of restaurants I have tried and some of them are considered high standard.  Prices are fantastic. I ordered 7-9 dim sum and it was a little more than $20."}
{"text":"Awesome place! I asked the young guy at the counter, who served me as well, what his favourite ones were. He was very friendly and helpful and suggested a few. I ordered the fried squid - best I ever had, the seasoning is sooo yummy - the shrimp with spinach and garlic which was marvellous, and the sticky rice with shrimp and cashew, which was also great. Price is great, food is great, service is great. I'll definitely come back!"}
{"text":"My favourite dim sum place in Toronto. Reasonable price, great dishes. Only concern is the room temperature during winter. If your seat is close to entrance, it can be very cold at everytime someone comes and goes."}
{"text":"Dim sum wasn't bad. I actually preferred this over the downtown China Town dim sum, but markham was better. But if don't feel like a drive thru traffic, not a bad second choice.  Ignore the decor or I think if they rearranged some stuff it would look good.   Service was attentive but only one server who did everything so be patient. Other reviewers did mention they were out of certain items...which if they were, they should inform us and not have it on the board.  Will go back..."}
{"text":"Love the dim sum here. I run a nearby restaurant in the area, and always come here when I'm craving dim sum! Their dim sum always tastes fresh and yummy. The owner, a young gentleman, is always pleasant & friendly. The other staff are pretty friendly & helpful too. Overall I much prefer the dim sum here vs chinatown when I'm grabbing take out."}
{"text":"Pretty good! Don't expect cheap Chinatown prices, but quality and freshness make up for that. We didn't know what to expect since we were dining in while many came and went for take out. We enjoyed a wide variety of Dim Sum and I can't negatively comment on any of our selections, all tasty (and I've had Dim Sum many times elsewhere where it was not great, just ok). Staff was friendly. Seems family run, pleasant neighbourhood business."}
{"text":"Its not the nicest ambience, sure, but the dim sum here is sooooo good. Well worth the trek for anyone downtown or West!"}
{"text":"Hrmm...   Ever get into that situation where you want to like something SO BADLY that you give it a try again to only be disappointed a second time around? That's how I felt about Ha Gow - only twice in the same DAY.   I don't know what made me do it...wait, yes I do, it was the hubs seething jealousy over me having a dim sum lunch and not saving any for him. I told him the dishes I had were mundane at best: the spareribs were too salty, the shumai over steamed and the pork buns (the filling its only saving grace) were really chewy.   But noooo, he just had to order dinner from there too - but we had to pick it up despite ALL of their flyers and their signage in store saying that they deliver.  Don't get the $8 spicy squid unless you are okay with paying $1 a piece for them. Rip off.   I'm super pumped to have this restaurant in my area, and I would try them again in hopes that as they get older their food becomes better. But as for my \"Little Bit of Heart\" (that's what Dim Sum means, I just learned you something bitch!) I'm not in a rush to dine there again."}
{"text":"Food was hot,  fresh and delicious!!   Tea cups smelt like bleach.  Coming back soon."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. And the lady working here was so happy that someone speaking Cantonese with her. So cute It's very local dim sum place just similar HK style  I used to eat every weekend for dim sum when I was living in HK. So I miss it so much!! Their material and ingredients are very fresh and great deal for the price :) deff going again soonnnnnn!!! Love it here!"}
{"text":"I felt that after reading such raving reviews about this restaurant I went in having higher expectations than usual. Yes for the area it's a good addition, for the cuisine I felt that it could be a lot better. It was bizarre going in and having to grab our cups, utensils and go up to grab the menu/order slip too. I am usually not a service snob however if I am paying extra to dine in, I'm doing most of the work here... Onto the food selection, it is very limited, not used to having such a small selection. Some items weren't even available, and I didn't even know until I went up to hand in the order slip. Only to be told this item wasn't available and then having to go back sit down and reselect. Back and forth I am going to hand in more order slips, why are we wasting so much paper to only order 1 extra item? Just take my order at the counter then, don't waste my energy. Prices were average, not extremely high and not super cheap either. Overall, I would skip this but if you are craving dim sum in the area then I suppose this would be a good option but definitely not my first choice."}
{"text":"It gets better. The food was awesome the 2nd time and the old lady who works there with the pink/purple jumper is super nice.  Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Went on a whim after a day of house cleaning. Great food ( hot and sour soup, wonton soup, shrimp dumplings (had both steamed and fried versions ) fried pork dumplings, scallop and seafood dumplings, and the grilled short rib special. All were outstanding. I can't even pick a favorite ! Fast and friendly service in a bright clean environment. Try this place. You won't be disappointed. Oh and the price ( 3 ppl only one pop but we did order multiplies of some dishes because they were just that good came to 43$ w 20 percent tip ). We will be back. Soon."}
{"text":"I was craving for Dim sum on Sunday morning, and I stumbled upon this place on Yelp while I was searching for a good Dim sum place in the east side of Toronto.   It is a tiny place on Danforth. When we arrived, we thought it was closed from the outside because the sign on the door said \"closed\" and it was SO dark inside!! We had to literally push our faces against the window to check if there was anyone inside. Indeed there were people eating. Rough start.   As I mentioned, this place is dark and small... not the greatest atmosphere at all. About six to seven tables. I get it is a small, family-owned restaurant that gives \"homey\" feel to it, but seriously, please at least keep the place look like it is well-maintained.   Food was okay, nothing special about them. They were warm as they came straight out from the kitchen. But I would rather go further to have better Dim sum in better atmosphere.  Overall, if you are near this area and craving for Dim sum so much that you need to eat in five minutes, this place will do."}
{"text":"I have ordered delivery from here twice now and I'm definitely going to come back.  We ordered a bunch of dim sum plates and they were cheap and tasty.  If you haven't been try it out."}
{"text":"Outside: giant eyecatching sign that screams HA GOW, as in those lovable shrimp dumplings.   Inside however: total no-frills dingy and basic casual Chinese diner like you'd might find in any small town or neighbourhood strip. The folks here are kind, but minimal service though--pick your own condiments and fill your own tea at the front counter, boy. When it is not busy, there is a habit of leaving tables uncleaned for a long while, which may leave a grimy impression for anyone just walking in (ding a point). It's not quality dining, but hey, they do take-out.  Sweet pickings off the a-la-carte order sheet, all the dim sum items are cheap cheap and quickly prepared-$3 per item, and a tad more if you order noodles or soups. A place that calls itself Ha Gow better make some decent ha gow, and indeed they do make pretty delicious ones. Same goes for their siu mai and many other dumplings and rice dishes, which gets you going enough. Heck, I would go for nothing but their ha gow/siu mai and the like. Not a fan of their steam bean curd rolls, though.  It's possible to eat for around $10-15/person at this humble Danforth joint, and is a decent choice if you want something cheap and be on the way elsewhere in the area. But eh, they also do local delivery.  {TTC: around the corner from Donlands subway station, boy.}"}
{"text":"They were closing early and still served us. Really great and friendly service. So good. So affordable! So happy to have this gem in the east end. The ha gow, pork pan dumplings, spring rolls, and yung chow were awesome. Great value. Under 20$ for two. Will be coming back. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Worst Chinese food ever. It's places like this that give Chinese food a bad name. Threw out 75% of our order.   Ordered what I thought would be staple Cantonese dishes that any decent place would find hard to screw up. Well guess what, Ha Gow managed to do just that. The seafood fried noodles were capital B bland - would it have hurt them to put even one drop of soy sauce? They also used cheap shrimp and squid that had no flavour. We also ordered the fried shrimp with spicy salt. This is honestly the most basic Cantonese dish (equivalent to fries for a Canadian restaurant). Well what came were those cheap shrimps they used for the noodles but smothered in a thick batter (they looked like balls of grease). Each bite oozed with grease and didn't taste like shrimp at all.  The other dishes ordered were equally bad. Seafood dumpling (all it tasted of was MSG), steamed squid in ginger and onion (think rubber bands laced with MSG), and shrimp rolls (no flavour). The spinach & shrimp dumpling was the only thing decent item.   Avoid, avoid, avoid."}
{"text":"I had read the great reviews so I thought it would be an appropriate place to take my family here for Mother's Day. Not going to lie, but I wasn't really sure what to expect - what the best time to go was, whether or not we would have to wait on a weekend, but just hoping for good quality dim sum.  Just after 12:00pm, I walked into a restaurant on a Mother's Day Sunday that was practically empty - very surprised and relieved that there was no lineup. The restaurant is SMALL - 6 tables tops, and a counter by the front. I think you can make reservations because we were told one of them was saved for someone else. Two ladies ran the front of house and I saw a few others cooking in the back, but while it was quite empty at this time, there was lots happening and the ladies could not keep up. I was pleasantly surprised to see all the interesting variations of our usual staples - including: - spinach and garlic shrimp dumpings - steamed scallop shrimp dumping - deep dried mashed taro crisps with curried chicken ...+ the usuals like steamed pork BBQ buns, steamed pork dumplings, shrimp rolls etc.  Everything came out at a fairly reasonable time, and was made fresh to order so all the food was hot and tasty.  The only things I was a little disappointed with was 1. They were out of rice noodle rolls - when it is advertised heavily on their board, I would wish they had enough supply 2. The service ended up being very slow. We tried to get the attention of the ladies time and time again but in the end, we ended up getting our own tea, and going to the front counter several times requesting for utensils etc.  Glad to see I can grab take out from this place because I'd give it a shot in the future. The bill was on par and as we were leaving, shortly after 1, the place was completely full, so you know this place is legit.  Oh - CASH ONLY, not debit machine."}
{"text":"Good place for dimsum and congee,cash only,little space for customers,self service in condiments..... Anyway overall good"}
{"text":"There's been a lot of mixed reviews from Yelpers for this place but mostly positive I would say. I can't speak for those who claim that the food is \"stale\", \"rotten\"...etc. As for my experience, it was absolutely nothing short of amazing!  This is a tiny dim sum place with minimal seating. You can look over the cash counter and see the dim sum chefs working away tirelessly making those tiny and delicate little morsels of goodness. This is by far the freshest, most delicious dim sum I have ever tasted in this city. This is on par and even exceed some of the elite dim sum places I have been to in Hong Kong -- I kid you not.  The selection is minimal, you have your basics with a few twists here and there but you won't find fine dining level dim sum here. There's no abalone, shark fin, bird's nest(bird's saliva stuff)..etc. Whatever few items they have, they do a phenomenal job with it. The only glaring thing missing is the egg tart. :(  It's a shame I live so far north of the city(where there's an abundance of dim sum restaurants) otherwise, I would be here every other day(come to think of it... it might not be such a bad thing).   This place is definitely the gold standard for dim sum in my books from here on. So go ahead, order a dozen of these at least and feast!"}
{"text":"I have eaten dim sum many times. Came here today after seeing a nice score on yelp with a friend. Ordered the very typical dim sum food, ha gow, siu Mai, chicken feet, curry cuttlefish, and beef ho fun stir fried. Unfortunately, nothing appeared to be amazing. Everything seemed to taste off and actually not authentic even though made by asians.  The chicken feet had a soapy after taste and the cuttlefish had no flavour, just super fishy and smelt like bleach. The worst part was that the beef ho fun was SO BURNT. Took two bites and left it there. The old lady waiter asked us if we wanted a takeout box but it was so unedible we said no. We didn't want to cause any trouble since she was so nice from the beginning. However she asked if it tasted okay, and we told her it was burnt after we paid. She told the male chef that we said it was burnt, and he said outloud \"IT'S NOT BURNT IT'S GOLDEN\". Little did he know we speak Cantonese and it was BLACK. By all means if you want to eat golden go ahead. I don't want to risk my life eating carcinogenic burnt food.   Forgot to take pics of the food for the gram but after eating it good thing I didn't. I'd rather travel farther to get real dim sum."}
{"text":"I'll say right up front that Ha Gow certainly doesn't serve up the most delicious dim sum I've ever had in the city, but the friendly service (family-run business yo) and a handful of their dishes that I find particularly tasty keep me coming back. Doesn't hurt that they also deliver, which is generally my preference over dining in their cheery but no-frills restaurant.    My favourites include the steamed shrimp dumplings, the spinach, garlic, shrimp dumplings, and the sticky rice. I just noticed that someone else listed those as their faves as well, so you probably can't go wrong with those selections."}
{"text":"A great place for weekend dim sum in the heart of East York. A wide selection of foods with a low-key atmosphere. You order using the forms from the counter and the waiter will bring your food as it's ready. Tea is available in an urn at the counter -- just walk up for a refill. Only about six tables, so the place feels quite homey and relaxed. I will definitely be going back for a Sunday brunch soon."}
{"text":"This is the best dim sum place in east York. Even the Chinatown east at Gerard and Broadview does not have as good dim sum.   The dim sum is divided in small, medium and large dishes which are 2.50, 2.90 and 3.50 per portion.  There's a combo for $9.75 which seems like a pretty good deal and I ordered it with the deep fried meatballs small dim sum.  It was very good, but the only reason I am not giving it 5* is that it is done in a very traditional way, which means A LOT of oil and grease.    I prefer the newer types of dim sum, cooked with minimal oil and grease and thus healthier."}
{"text":"Get the spinach dumplings! Would recommend & definitely come back here again. Mix your own sauce which is great with sweet vinegar!"}
{"text":"Really tasty dim sum, decor could be a lot better but that's offset by the good prices."}
{"text":"Good dim sum is a rarity south of the 401, and especially in the east end of downtown. Even with old Chinatown, it's hard to find a decent place. When Ha Gow recently opened on Danforth & Donlands, showing some promise with its cute signage and welcoming discounts (15% off if you pay with cash), I half-heartedly hoped it would change the tides of a very culinarily disjointed neighbourhood.  The premise of my review was purely for their all-day dim sum, since cheap Chinese food can be found everywhere in the area. I ordered traditional items: ha gow, siu mai, lo bak go (turnip cake, or otherwise known as my litmus test for good dim sum) and steamed spare ribs with black bean sauce. I was slightly disappointed at the lack of chung feng (steamed rice sheets rolled with shrimp or pork or beef) as it's one of my favourites, but it's a difficult item to make so that may be the reason for its omission. Prices range from $2.70 - $3.30 (small, med, large dishes) which is average and there is a dim sum combo for $8.99.   Dim sum aside, they also offer a full typical Chinese menu and lunch specials (shanghai noodles, chicken sticky rice bun, braised beef noodle) that include a spring roll and pop, and are available from 11am - 3pm.   The taste of the food was mediocre, on par with greasy Markham foodcourts. I did like the ha gow, because there was a subtle hint of white pepper. On second thought, that may have been used to mask shrimp that was not exceedingly fresh. Siu mai was kind of rubbery and they overcooked the lo bak go to the point that it seemed fried. I had to drink an excess of tea to wash everything down.  Everything also came in a styrofoam take-out container despite my plea that I was eating in, which peeved me slightly. There is complimentary self-serve jasmine tea and an assortment of soy sauce, sweet and sour sauce and chili oil packaged in tiny take-out plastic containers. No mustard was available though.   The generous space is only populated by a window bar and three 4-person tables with a lonely table of 2 along the other wall. It would seem that the owners intended to cater to the take-out crowd, rather than a nice dim sum atmosphere with loud conversations and elbow rubbing seating. That would probably be too much of a culture shock for people around these parts. The restaurant was definitely generating a buzz for those unfamiliar with dim sum, or Chinese food in general, so that made me smile. I must have heard sticky rice explained three times, each time met with curiosity and healthy appreciation.   Check it out if you are in the area and need of a serious dim sum fix, but don't expect too much. If you've never tried dim sum or want to get to know the dishes better, I would recommend going in. The owners (family with two sons) are very friendly and would gladly help you out with the menu."}
{"text":"Always looking for good dim sum places in the east end.  This is a NO-FRILLS dim sum place, but the food is actually pretty good.  Think about the average chinese/dim sum place in Toronto, with its plastic table covers, chipped plates and sticky soy sauce dispensers.  Now take it down three notches - no actual dishware or silverware.  We're talking about styrofoam containers and plastic cutlery.    But the rice noodles are yummy, fried dumplings are tasty and the spicy/salty tofu is cough-inducing salty.  There are only 5 tables so don't be surprised there may be a wait involved.  Place your order at the counter and they'll bring your food to your table."}
{"text":"Best Dim Sum I have ever had. Really nice little family business. They really pay attention to the little details. Cash only, but still epic."}
{"text":"This is actually very decent dim sum for the price (and location).  Service was super friendly too."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: So while I haven't been to many Dim Sum places in Toronto (so I'm not sure if there's a specific style here), but I still have a decent sense for what Canadian Dim Sum tastes like.   So the interior of the place is... low key. Not all the chairs are quite the same, some tables have sauces while others don't (but you can self serve from their take out table[?]), and the decor is very simple. The garbage where they scrape off the leftovers from your plates are next to one of the tables. Needless to say, it's a casual place.  But if you're look for quick delicious food, this is the place to be at. My friend and I got Dim Sum Sunday lunch and the food was prepared quickly and was quite delicious. The steamed dumplings were delicious, the pork buns were tasty, and the spring rolls were pretty appetizing.   The service was quick, although I wouldn't expect any personal attention, but decent enough. And you really can't beat the price; for 22$ with tip we got 6 dishes.   So all and all, it's a pretty decent way to fill yourself for cheap!"}
{"text":"We ordered a wide variety from Ha Gow Dim Sum, and they did a great job. The food was portioned well, tasty and offered a unique take on some traditional items (Dim Sum). It is a good place with good value. Not going to blow your socks off, but won't disappoint. Have gone back, and will continue to revisit for Dim Sum."}
{"text":"The good:  The Ha Gow was decent for the price, not that flavourful but okay.  The black bean spareribs were okay as well, not the best, not the worst.  The bad:  The Siu Mai was tough and bland, the BBQ pork bun salty!  The ugly:  Ordered some Sweet and Sour Pork to go... The oil tasted rancid, the sauce salty not sweet and there was so much breading and so little pork that what little sauce there was got soaked up by the thick breading.  Threw this dish in the composter!  Will not be back... Maybe it is the best Dim Sum on the Danforth, but that doesn't mean it's good."}
{"text":"Their quality changes from week to week. When stuff was made fresh for that week, it's passable, but when we're eating stuff prepared the week before, it tastes stale and even rotten. ie: Sweet-n-Sour anything. The Sweet-n-Sourness comes from the sauce, not sweet sauce with sour meat. If the meat is sour, send it back.  Steamed meat balls when fresh are decent... missing bamboo shoots, but okay, when they are made the week before, don't order them. Poor handling and refrigeration and stuff tastes a bit vinegary... tall tale signs they were left out too long.   Eggplant isn't a favourite of mine but they should be steamed yet firm and cooked. If they look like they're shrivelled up in any way. It's been reheated/re-steamed and shouldn't be eaten as with many of their dishes.  Their lack of hygiene is suspicious and food quality is worse than Broadview China town. Some people rave about their food as if it were da bomb... well da bomb is how I'd describe this place as if a bomb went off. I felt like I was walking into a high school cafeteria after the busy lunch crowd passed. There were dirty tables everywhere we looked and the floor was no better.  Overall stuff looks like the ways they're suppose to, but taste wise it varies from week to week. If you want to authentic Chinese, this isn't it... it's a pale imitation of Chinese food from a home cooked perspective. If there was pride in their food, the kitchen wouldn't look so dirty. As for those people who think Chinese food/hospitality is suppose to look that way. I am offended as that is the North American lazy take-out restaurant mentality and in no way what actual full  Chinese service looks like."}
{"text":"The food was good. But i placed an order through the ubereats app for 2 siomai (4pcs each) and only one of them arrived. I called the restaurant to ask what happened and they blamed uber for it and not even offering anything to help. I'll never order from this place ever again"}
{"text":"I love dim sum. This is one of my favourite dim sum place as its in a convenient location (just a few steps from Donlands station) and pricing is reasonable. A plate of dim sum starts from $2.90. Depending what you order.  Its fresh, fast and affordable pricing with good portions. They also have dishes served apart from dim sum like long green bean str fry with black beans served with rice which is my favourite.  They have a self serve style which you order and pay at the counter and they will bring you the food. Chinese tea and water is situated at a corner for self replenishment. Its a quick, fuss-free self serve style of dim sum. Bonus is, they do delivery too."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for afternoon Dimsum today, and we were quite surprised by the quality.  We had their combo, which included deep fried wontons, shrimp rolls, a spring roll, two har gow, two Sui Mai, and two beef Sui Mai, one another type of dumpling, and lotus leaf wrapped sticky rice . We also ordered the deep fried taro with curry chicken, and spinach shrimp dumplings.  Overall the food was really good for what we can find within the GTA. Hands down, better than anything you find in the close-by Chinatown.   We highly recommend the lotus leaf sticky rice, it's awesome! Balanced flavours, and full of yummy fillings, they don't skimp!  The service was fine, and they have self-serve area full of condiments, extra utensils, hot tea, and napkins. So if you want extra of something, you can help yourself!  We will definitely be back, it will probably be our go-to place for Dimsum whenever we crave it!"}
{"text":"Just got dim sum from here and i just found it OK. I think it might be im just not a fan of steamed rubbery foods like steamed dim sum. I did like the pan fried dumpling a lot mmmmm.  I just thought i would give the steamed ones a shot since i wanted to look for something healthier. WELL steamed dim sum is just not for me. I guess ima keep eating sushi for my healthy asian takeout needs and splurge on some fried dim sum when i dont feel so fat."}
{"text":"Ok to be fair to them I am writing an update. Returned a few times for dine in and take out. Once you get over an often painful ordering process and slow wait time since it's all fresh, they give you splendid dim sum. It's delicious. Just be prepared for the annoyance before the dim sum."}
{"text":"We went here to avoid a long lineup at Mother's Dumplings. It turned out to be a decent alternative. I actually liked the super casual cafeteria atmosphere. Everything is very reasonably priced and comes to the table quickly. Of the things we ordered I really liked the pan fried green onion pancakes and the steamed spinach with shrimp and garlic dumplings. Next time, I will pass on the deep fried mash taro with curry chicken and the pineapple and ginger drink."}
{"text":"The number one dim sum and mom-and-pop shop in Toronto - hands down. The dim sum comes out steamy hot and the dishes are deliciously flavourful!   We ordered the ha how, siu mai, garlic squid, spinach dumpling, and a bunch of other dishes too. For 2 people, I suggest ordering at least  6 or 7 dishes (each are around $3-4). Our total came to $35 with tax and tip. This restaurant is a definitely among my top 10 places to eat in Toronto. I am in a dim sum nirvana just reminiscing about our dinner here. Only locals know about this place so it's almost never packed.  Pro tip: You need to order at the counter. So pick up an order slip, choose wisely on your fav dishes, and hand it back to the person behind the counter.   Prop tip 2: You'll need to \"self-serve\". So grab your plates, chopsticks, tea, etc. They only bring you the food. The food makes up for this so I don't care.  Prop tip 3: There's tables that seat up to 4, so don't come with a crowd of 10 or more.   Transit directions: Take the TTC to Donlands Station, walk towards Danforth (turn right when you exit the station entrance) and then when you're on Danforth, look straight across. It's a bit hidden, but well worth the find.  When we were here, there was a white dude working with the Chinese mom, dad, and uncle. We had speculated that he was adopted but didn't ask. Anyways, they were all super nice.   Pro tip 4: They deliver locally and have lunch specials.  I wish I lived nearby because I'd be here at least once a week. It's my dim sum secret place, more of an \"super elite spot\" in my books. In comparison, the food here is far superior than compared to any dim sum restaurant near Dundas and Spadina. I think it's their family recipes that are used and the fact that the owners really care about the art of dim sum making. A must eat!"}
{"text":"Went there last week, wow the food i had was great, just wish the P parking was a bit closer tho.  Had some dim sum (How Cow and sui my) and for a main had shrimps and lobster sauce with a bowl of steam rice and couple of spring rolls and a can of pop.  Will go back again even tho will be moving back to Scarborough soon, it will be worth the drive to come down."}
{"text":"First of all. Thanks to yelp. I found this place from u guys.   Just walk in, I noitce grand pa is cooking and I know that we r at right place.

{"text":"I love dim sum, but living in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania doesn't give me much variety. Ha Gow's food was flawlessly prepared, the staff was warm and helpful, and i enjoyed trying some new things."}
{"text":"This place has some tasty treats! I enjoyed a curry and onion dish with the most tender baby squid. So delicious! There were shrimp balls, steamed shrimp dumplings, beef balls with chive and plain. So good, but somehow we didn't order classic dim sum! Go figure.   The atmosphere was hole in the wallish (typically a good thing) and in this case it was a good thing indeed. Prices were fair and the fillings of the dishes were generous.   Seating was a bit uncomfortable, but the warm tea was nice. Friendly server as well. Rad sign out front too. I forgot to take a photo of it, but here are the photos I did grab!"}
{"text":"Yum! Really great dim sum, we obviously ordered way too much as usual and portion siZes were really good! Price is about the same as most dim sum places but service was really great and attentive! Restaurant was nice and clean and will definitely be returning!"}
