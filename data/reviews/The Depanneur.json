{"text":"I've been going to the Depanneur nearly once a week for a few months. They have a casual atmosphere, and are generally a good venue to find local food stuffs. Corner store by day, dinner establishment by (some) nights, it's really a great space.

The drop-in dinners are usually why we end up there once a week (or more) whenever they have a vegan one (which is on the regular.) It's always something different, but it has been consistently delicious. The chef stylings of Len (who I think is the owner) cooking something up every Tuesday, Emily Z, or Kalmplex (and many others) make this place just a total hidden gem (that I kind of don't want to tell anyone about, because I want to keep it to myself.)

As people have mentioned, sign up for the newsletter on their website (or connect with them on facebook/twitter) to keep up with the events they have going on, there is always something for everyone. 

The house made sodas are totally delicious (elderberry, blackcurrent, maple lemonade, just to name a few), they also have coffee/tea, apple cider, and soy milks. 

Packaged foods include local mushrooms, jams and jellies, ketchup made in house, and freshly baked buns and breads (often with gluten-free options as well), soups, milks, yogurts, and other small business produced products.

There is WiFi, there is table space, and the service is always friendly. It's like a home cooked meal in the best possible way.

Things to know: CASH ONLY (there is an ATM available at the convenience store across the street)"}
{"text":"Delicious food, fun atmosphere, friendly service and filling a bit of a breakfast/brunch void in this area.

It's a small place, with a corner store make-up matching it's name. This paired with a bright interior and fresh flowers on the communal tables (more solitary seating along the windows) this place is among the most whimsical places I've been to in a while. 

In winter the windows fog up and the condensation freezes ... literally frosted windows. It adds to the atmosphere. 

I don't think there could be a legitimate complaint about the food options - not tons of choices, but enough to choose from for people with any type of food preferences or requirements. I liked the French toast cubes with yoghurt and fruit sauce. The greens came with deliciously pickled cabbages strips. My vegan friend enjoyed the grits. I tried the drip coffee (which was fine), and I think they have some fancier coffee options as well. 

Despite all the thumbs up above, still no 5 stars, because: 
Maybe it's worse in winter, when the door stays closed, but I noticed a distinct grease smell in my hair and clothes after each of the two times I've been here recently

I have not tried their dinner options. Hopefully soon."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic dinner here last weekend.  It was part of the supper club night and so featured a guest chef who is a tea sommelier.  Had a good chat with owner Len also and loved his whole philosophy of bringing the love of food to everybody and at an affordable price.  
Highly recommended.  I know I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"My brain is still buzzing from the Turkish dessert of tahini halva and lemon October 1st!  Depanneur is brilliant."}
{"text":"This place was so unique and so yummy! We each ordered one of their specials that day which consisted of yummy pancakes with amazing toppings. 
Would definitely go back for their specials!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. 

Came here on a Sunday night for their Craft Beer Supper Club. The chef was having a whale of a time cooking up her favourite dishes. Oh, and the beer was awesome too.

This place just thrives and embodies the pure love of food. I cannot recommend it enough! The beer was great, the food was UNREAL, and the ambiance can't be beat (I kept saying it looks like my grandma's kitchen). GO NOW!"}
{"text":"Came for Sunday brunch. Ordered the \"Rusholme,\" which promised the following: \"Fresh fruit, crispy bacon, French-toasted bread pudding, mini pancakes, maple syrup, mini croissant, compound butter.\" Number one: What compound butter? There was no butter, period. Number two: What croissant? What we got was a dinner roll in the shape of a croissant. Three: When I ordered a double espresso, I got weak brewed coffee. After I took a sip, I let the waitress know it wasn't what I ordered, so she apologized and brought back....exactly the same thing. I gave up after that. Only thing I can say is the bread pudding was tasty and the bacon was indeed crispy. But with all the places in town offering far superior fare, I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Just an AWESOME experience, event, meal, and concept! A corner, neighborhood location with an 'open kitchen' that's right out of your home. Seats 23, and invites chefs-from local restaurants, across the Nation of Canada, around the world, across the street-literally!-epicureans who simply love. good. food. It's BYOB and the Sunday \"event\" was classic Boeuf Bourginon as the centerpiece of a four course meal. Best C$40 I spent the entire week I was in Toronto. Nine guests (and guests in the warmest sense of hospitality) gathered around, family style, white tablecloths, candlelight, pitchers of water, and the convivial nature such surroundings are designed to create, as a cold February night and flurries settled on the City outside. The Chefs responsible and the owner, Len, joined us as each course was served, with conversation naturally drifting across subjects, settings, and indeed even languages. A more welcoming, yet 'cosmopolitan' experience I cannot imagine. If The Depanneur suffers from one thing, it's that it escapes a 'quick description'. That said, how can you pass this up? You shan't, I advise, in the strongest and sincerest of terms. Truly, outstanding. Thank you so much for the experience! Warmest Regards from your most distant \"Sunday Dinner Club\" member down in Little Rock, Arkansas!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great brunch and great neighbourhood vibe. Their supper clubs are a great way to discover new food and new chefs!"}
{"text":"The \"Dep\" is an amazing restaurant. No two nights' menus are the same, but everything served is high quality and delicious.

Brunch is served every weekend. I recommend the French toast or the daily specials that they had (I just had house made sausage, bacon, fried egg, greens, and creme fraiche served on buckwheat pancakes - yum!).

Dinners vary every night depending on the chef. I've been over 6 times now and have never had a disappointing meal. They're typically accommodating to dietary restrictions - in fact one of my favourite meals here was a vegan \"meatloaf\"

I can't recommend this place enough! Just go!"}
{"text":"Coffee was nice they have almond milk which is great..  i ordered the vegan meal. Besides being disgusting looking the taste was even worse. My stomach hurts after only a couple bites because i simply couldnt eat it."}
{"text":"Amazing little place with sooo much going on. This owner is doing it right. Nothing else like it in Toronto. 
Different chief /food every night. Wed. Is vegan. There is an open night mic night. New.chiefs welcome. Too many things going on to.get on this review.  Just very very different then the stuffy expensive restaurants here in Toronto.  We went on Sunday and the owner popped in and sat with us and chatted the whole time. Told us what it was all about and what an amazing guy he is. Giving back to.the community threw his place. You just have.to.check this place out. A+"}
{"text":"Great foods, Excellent service, Nice and local ambiance.

Just dropped by on my first trip to Toronto and this places tops all the food I've had.

You must try Kimchi Waffle! This comes from a Korean."}
{"text":"Went for brunch. This place is a small charming little restaurant. Don't be fouled by the outside look of the place. Great ambiance and good food. Everything is done if front of you by one chef. Would definetly try again."}
{"text":"Stopped in for brunch, they were out of many of the menu items, the server did try to offer substitutions, but options were limited. It took almost an hour after we ordered to get our food. Food was just okay"}
{"text":"We dropped in again for weekend brunch! Not as impressed this time with the offerings....I guess their chefs and staff rotate seasonally and menus change often, not sure if we would come back for this menu which consists of mix and match breakfast items,  frittata and French toast. 

The chef was nice enough to take the French toast off the bill when I mentioned that it's a tad burned on the outside."}
{"text":"There are better brunch options around Toronto.   I failed to find anything unique in the menu.   The basics didn't taste to par (Hey,  competition is high!) 

Coffee and Americano was not what it was meant to be.   Grinds were expired.   

Eggs and Panelle -  meh

The space is interesting and has potential."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review out of nostalgia. I haven't been to The Dep for at least nine months. I may be in the nabe less, I may be trying to save money, but I know that they're having amazing pay what you can (after 10 pm, is it?) drop in dinners, and comforting delicious weekend brunches, so I need to get back here.

Scandinavian-style communal seating, so don't expect much privacy. On the other hand between the rustic tables, the steamed-up windows in winter and the bowls of steaming goodness, it's easy to imagine you're Sigrid Undset. 

Always vegetarian options, always fabulous food. One of those secrets that make me glad I live in TO."}
{"text":"So the food here is good, but the service is questionable. I don't really want to say anything bad about a place with good food, but the total for our bill was way higher than expected. When I asked for a receipt (so I could review the charges), all the waitress did was give me a slip of paper with a total on it. Eventually I had to tell her that the bill was way higher than expected and asked her to explain it to me. She reviewed the bill on her computer, and said she \"accidentally\" charged us for a THIRD meal (when we had ordered two). She refunded the difference and said it was an honest mistake, but really, I don't feel that was enough. Should we always be provided with an itemized receipt? That's what made me mad, and feeling that this place isn't as honest as it should be."}
{"text":"\"A place where interesting food things happen\". This is how the depanneur describes itself, and it's so very true. I have to give this place 5 stars because it stands for so much - in terms of involving the community in all things food, creating a community, and sharing of knowledge. There's something different going on here every day, and it brings people together to learn new things, from how to make vegan cheese, to discussions about the food movement and where it's at. I haven't come across another place in Toronto like this, and I really do have to admire Len Senator and his wife for creating this beautiful, magical space.

Not to mention, the food was delicious at the last event I attended. We had Moroccan tagine with couscous, lentil soup, carrot salad, orange yogurt dessert. It feels like you're in Len's home, and he's cooking for you. The food tastes so real and I appreciate how the food isn't overly seasoned."}
{"text":"I came here just after unknowingly getting a concussion and everyone was really nice to me despite my crabby attitude. (I'm sorry)
The food was really yummy and it was a fun experience to watch the chef doing their thing and even though he seemed juiced at times he didn't yell at anyone.
Plus everything was so reasonable! Overall the guest chef and drop in dinner is a really great idea and fun to participate in."}
{"text":"Such a simple menu but so well done. The service was very good and the chef was right on the other side of the counter putting everything together. 

Felt like I was eating at home with a lot of friends around"}
{"text":"I've returned twice this weekend for their amazing brunch. Delicious food. Free run eggs (important to me) lovely staff and cool atmosphere! I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great place for brunch. Local ingredients, Len the owner is super nice and the ambiance is very relaxed."}
{"text":"I was there tonight for the one-pot dinner. 9$ for green Thai curry, and a red curry with sweet potatoes. The second was amazing. I could have eaten seconds and thirds.
Len also made, on the spot, a maple lemonade that was a perfect sweet and tart counterpart to the spice.
At 6:15 it was getting busy. Maybe a little trendy but not pretentious in the least.
A great idea and lovely setting. He's done wonders with a space that looked like it should have been condemned. Now it's white and brick, clean, cheerful, eclectic. 
Will return for sure for the warm welcome and fantastic food.

("}
{"text":"Brunch here is awesome, and everyone here was super friendly. It was the best vibe to have a hungover brunch. They have a lot of variety on their mix and match menu. I got the frittata + baked beans and panelle and it was incredible. Plus when you check in on yelp you get a free coffee! All around great place and I'll definitely be back to try everything on their brunch menu."}
{"text":"Amazing concept, great food and super cheap for what you're getting. Glad I came across this place and can't wait to come again."}
{"text":"Came for the Thick Cut Brunch. They rent out The Depanneur on weekends to serve brunch for its customers. They have a Mix and Match option where you get to choose from a list of breakfast items that range from $3-5. I definitely recommend the thick cut bacon, which is their signature item. All the ingredients feel really fresh and homemade. Might be because they're making it right behind you as the kitchen is basically part of the seating area. The place is quite small, but has fun vibes. The service is very good too as everyone there is very friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"This is an amazing concept and I've loved every meal I've had there. For all those people who are amateur chefs who cook a few dishes really well, this is like an open-mic night in the kitchen. So far, as a consumer of food (to put it bluntly), I've been really impressed by the quality of the meals. Wednesday's is all veggie and most days there are veggie options. Compared to a normal restaurant the prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is very social. I've heard the cooking classes are also neat - I have yet to attend but I'm looking forward to it."}
{"text":"Cute spot. It's like hanging out in a friend's kitchen while they cook supper. V reasonable prices and lots of locals from the neighborhood."}
{"text":"From first appearances, the Depanneur is just another lovely place to buy coffee, cheese, eggs and baked goods. My friends who live nearby are lucky: they can visit this corner shop regularly and indulge. As for me, it's a small trek but each trip would be worthwhile especially if it's for one of the special dinner parties. Apart from being a local grocer, the Depanneur is also the home of the Rushholme Park Supper Club. 

Despite walking over there in the drizzling, cold rain, I was greeted to a welcoming atmosphere. It was cozy and warm, and the smell of food wafting in the air. White linens dressed two long tables that formed one long communal table. The kitchen is large and open to us; I felt like I was in someone's house rather than a grocery store. 

Each dinner at the Depanneur varies, and the night's food theme was black and white which meant all of the food served were in those two colours. For fun, each guest had to dress up in those colours too. 

It was three course dinner and because we were a small group, we had ample seconds. Here's a sampling of what we had: 

- White and Black bean soup, with fresh cheese & black garlic
- Squid-ink pasta with white truffle Alfredo sauce  
- Linguine with black trumpet mushrooms
- Black sesame and vanilla ice creams 
- Homemade Oreos with white chocolate ganache infused with espresso & cacao nibs

It was all delicious, and what a surprise to taste certain flavours that I didn't expect in each dish. Because we were a small group of approximately 10 guests, we had a chance to talk to the supperclub and store's owner and our chef for the evening, Len. He explained to us how he created each dish, as well as what his plans were for his store and supperclub. I loved his ideas so far!

His goal is to make the Depanneur is a place where great food events happen and most importantly, accessible to all. Supperclubs are a wonderful opportunity to try delicious food and mingle with wonderful like-minded people but a lot of them are expensive to join. But membership at this supperclub will set you back $40, which is steal. The one caveat is that it's valid for one night. If you want to attend another food event, you have to pay $40 for another membership that is valid for that night. See what I'm getting at?

It's a good idea to sign up for the newsletter so you don't miss on what's coming. That's how I learned about the dinner. The Depanneur also plays host to weekend brunches and Tuesday night drop-in dinners which cost you less than $20.  

Len also explained to us that the supperclub is open to anyone who wants to host a dinner. Apart from having dinner parties with guest chefs, you can host your own and have all of the right tools and equipment at your disposal. My friend Ashley is thinking of hosting one of these dinners; she's a great cook so I can't wait for that event to happen!

Thanks to my lovely experience last night, it's certain that I'll return. Nothing beats eating a great meal with old and new friends, and the Depanneur is doing a great job at becoming a neighbourhood favourite.

A point to remember: Cash only."}
{"text":"Super endroit !

Touristes pour une fin de semaine (1 personne de Montréal, 2 d'Espagne) J'ai trouvé ce resto grâce aux excellents avis sur Yelp. Nous avons été plus que charmés par l'endroit ! Le staff était super sympathique, la bouffe était délicieuse!
Mon ami espagnol a dit \"We can fell it's made out of love\" et je pense que ça résume très bien tout ce qui doit être dit !
Produits locaux, parfois bio !
les \"bines\" (fèves au lard) à l'ananas... quelle surprise de voir qu'elles étaient vegan, puisqu'elles étaient réellement succulentes !!!!
Semblerait que la fritata était délicieuse aussi...
Nous y sommes allés bruncher le dimanche ;)

On aime aussi le concept de garder \"l'essence\" du dépanneur qu'était le local autrefois !!!

Excellent ambiance !
Chouette décor !
Great staff!
Bonne bouffe!
Bons prix !
on a adoré !!!!

Lorsque je reviendrai à Toronto, je vais définitivement retourner à cet endroit !


Longue vie au Dépanneur!"}
{"text":"What a great brunch. A bit on the pricey side - we paid about CAD40 for two people - but well worth it. The omelette was three standard deviations better than the norm - which is surprising for a dish with such low variance on the delicious spectrum.

Also worth saying: the space itself is very cool. It's just a single room with an open kitchen in the back, a couple of long tables, and a counter by the front window. It kind of feels like you're in someone's house (not in a bad way)."}
{"text":"Came for the Goan drop in dinner. The veg curry meal was simple and good but was overpriced for what is was...a small bowl of vegetables in curry. Same for the dessert. Two meals and one split dessert came to $38.  I was also given the wrong amount of change (short changed).

Note there is very limited seating. And this place is very casual."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: This review is based solely on the guest chef dinners that they host.

Thanks to my generous and kind roommate, I have been to 3 of these amazing dinners. Two have been with Chef Daniel Henderson (Director of Culinary Operations at Bento Sushi) for a lovely exploration into fusion sushi and one with Chef Greg Couillard for enhanced traditional Mexican food.

Each and every time, The Depanneur experience is like going to an intimate dinner with 10 or so other people who are about to be your future friend for an evening. You can expect that the person next to you to be a fascinating stranger with interesting stories to share (ex. an actor at the local Broadway or an author). Typically I don't like having to sit next to anyone for my dinners (I'm not in a cafeteria) but this is type of relaxing family setting is likely to win anyone over. 

These dinners serve some of the most creative and tasty food you'll ever try (cornbread/bbq sushi, lobster infuse azteca soup, etc). This venue gives top chefs the chance to try out recipes they wouldn't normally have the chance to serve. They bring in fresh  meat & veg and prepare the food in front of you. If they can, they try to bring in local farmer's produce.  

I don't give 5 stars very often, but this place thoroughly deserves it. It's run by people who truly understand the importance of care and creativity in food and atmosphere while dining. So please, sign up on their website and try out one of these dinners!"}
{"text":"The Dep is so much more than just a cafe, grocery stop, and sometimes restaurant. It's also an inspiration and reminder to gather with loved ones, congregate with kindred spirited strangers, and let someone else do the cooking at least once in a while.

By day, the large windows of the corner cafe makes a great place to prop yourself up on one of the bar stools solo with a French press (they don't brew drip coffee to ensure that every cup is as fresh as can be) and a newspaper. Alternatively, you could also bring your friends and family and occupy one of the long tables in the middle. Guava cookies are baked in house weekly by a resident chef and are a must-try.

By night, depending on what night of the week it is, the Dep plays host to drop-in dinners; multi-course, prix fixe, BYOB family style glutton fests; and hands-on cooking classes. At one Rusholme Park Supper Club dinner over the summer, there was so much extra fried chicken, biscuits, and pie that everyone received a stuff-your-own doggy bag.

Sign up for their newsletter, open up to their endless ability to inspire you to try new things, drop in for a quiet cuppa, and make plans well in advance (many ticketed events sell out quickly) to join the Supper Club."}
{"text":"Ok so if you know the Depanneur you already know that they do things a little differently than your typical restaurant. Their tag line, \"A place where interesting food things happen\" is no lie. They are always hosting supper clubs, and workshops on how to make pickles or vegan cheese, and having speakers come in to talk about sustainable food practices or other such things. Check their website (https://thedepanneur.ca/) or Facebook for the constantly changing roster of food things and pick anything and it will probably be great.  

They are also known for doing a somewhat regular brunch. It has historically been your more \"traditional\" style - eggs, bacon, french toast, salad, etc. Somewhat simple but always very well prepared so that is still feels special. 

BUT right now, they are playing host to Mazeh, a Levantine (i.e. Middle Eastern) brunch \"pop up\" and OH MAN is it delicious. Open for a couple weeks as of this post, and planning to run every Saturday and Sunday until the summer, you would be fool to not check it out while you can. With a small but mighty menu of classic Iranian and Lebanese dishes with a little twist, my group of three at brunch today were nearly giddy over how tasty everything was. Two of us ordered the breakfast shawarma with eggs, cheese, caramelized onions, pomegranate seeds and smashed fava beans wrapped in a grilled pita. The third in our group ordered an zucchini and herb frittata with a side salad. Everything came with fresh made labneh. Everything was consumed down to its last morsel. 

We really wanted to order the cream cheese stuffed pancakes with orange blossom syrup and pistachios for dessert (because how could you not want that?) but agreed we were sadly too full. Reading our minds our server came over and asked if we wanted the pancakes, but modified to \"kid size.\" Yes of course we said. Thank you we said. It was an excellent decision because hello that pancake was perfect."}
{"text":"Still not clear on the relationship between thick cut brunch and le depanneur, but what a quaint little space. Felt like I was in my friends living room. Ordered the works--a pretty standard brunch option of eggs, bacon, potatoes and salad, but also got a side of the salmon belly. The salmon belly and the thick cut bacon were the standouts by a long shot. I plan to come back for one of their creative dinner programs or cooking classes!"}
