{"text":"We came here for Winterlicious and it was delicious! I had the smoked salmon salad, duck, and panna cotta for dessert. The duck was cooked just right with nice layer of crispy skin. And the panna cotta had a nice drizzle of vanilla bean sauce. Yummmmm"}
{"text":"Met friends after work for to share in the tail end of a birthday dinner surprise.   Upon entering the dining room, I was amazed by the design and décor.  It was a lovely restaurant - loved the mix of tables ( if you decide to go with a group, ask for one of the round tables)  Furniture is all mission furniture....reminding me of my parents dining room.  Cozy, lovely.   Felt lovely.   My bf decided to order the Winterlicious menu, and the service was quick and spot on.  Warm bread was served - apparently baked in house.  I cant eat it, but bf said it was delicious.    I had a glass of house Winterlicious wine and nibbled from his plates.  He had the smoked duck - very small portion, nothing fancy or to write further about.   Entrée was the scallops.   Small small small portion again.  Lots of seafood.  First bite was delicious but the rest lacked flavour.  blah.  blah  blah.    not top 11 winterlicious at all    - speed at which food came out could have been our first sign.   agh.   throughout this experience the server was pleasant, joking, and attentive.  this is important later.   The bill for my dinner with the bf came separately.  He paid & tipped appropriately.  Nothing was said.   The larger group - six people - typically an autograt is put onto it.   The group was a bit confused as 4 people were paying for six ppl's dinners.    it is always awkward to discuss money around others - esp when you are treating them to a dinner; while this is not an excuse the server's response was not ok.  She yelled at the table - ok, just want you let you know you left a xx tip on xxx.  It was shockingly low - esp for a table of people who have worked in the service industry.   The other tables around us heard and it was incredibly embarrassing. Discussed with manager - however, he said it was the second last night of Winterlicious - that is no excuse for having a server yell at a table.  She could have quietly given the cheque back and let us fix it.  I demanded an apology to the table and that was not given.  The server disappeared for the night & was not seen by any of us.   We would have loved ot have had the chance to correct what didn't go right the first time - thanking her for her service.  I don't plan to go to restaurant again.   if you can't deal with Winterlicious, book the time off or don't do it in your restaurant."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for the first evening of winterlicious this year. We both had the foie torchon, he had the pork for his main and I had the Bison. For dessert, he had their cheese plate and I had their dark chocolate cake. In addition to the winterlicious menu, we also ordered a mushroom purée soup, a glass of wine, and an apple cider.  The food was good, nothing bad, but at the same time, nothing really stood out either. If I had to pick out the best item we ate that evening, it would be the foie torchon for sure. I had ordered my bison rare, but it came out a medium rare instead, but it was still good and I didn't bother to send it back.   The service was ok as well, but again, seem to be missing the finer details. They missed details such as the server not introducing herself to us, no hello either, she went straight into \"our soup of the day is...\" And continued describing that evening's menu. I had also asked for a cup of hot water, which I got, but it didn't come with a slice of lemon (again, just minor details, but I think details do count in a restaurant such as this).  The ambience felt business casual, not overly formal. I don't think I would come here for a romantic anniversary occasion. For a business lunch or dinner, yes.  Overall, I feel their winterlicious menu was of great value ($35 set menu that included foie gras torchon and the food was good, but I am not sure if I would come back for their regular menu. A solid good, but nothing to call home about."}
{"text":"After hearing great things about this place, my boyfriend and I decided to venture here for Winterlicious. At $20 for lunch it seemed like a steal. While waiting for our first course we were served bread with the most amazing spread - beet butter! The beets added an intense magenta pink colour and a sweet and savoury flavour. Unfortunately we were only given two small pieces of bread each. To be fair I didn't ask for more bread, but isn't it the servers job to be on top of things like this? It's a good thing I didn't hold my breath, because no such offer was given.  For my first course I ordered the smoked duck and was disappointed by the very small portion that included 4 or 5 very thinly sliced pieces of duck. It was nevertheless delicious. The celeriac remoulade and lambs lettuce paired perfectly, but the dainty portion was so unsatisfying. I was looking forward to my entree, which was an ocean trout served with a soy glaze, baby bok choy, shiitake mushrooms, water chestnuts, red onion, and a lime caramel sauce. However, I was puzzled to see my trout served skin side up after seeing it plated skin side down for other guests. Whether this was intentional or not I do not know. Despite the presentation, my main course was very good. The fish was perfectly cooked and the flavours were clean and well-balanced. The portion again was a little on the small side, but after reminding myself that I'm getting 3 courses of quality food for only $20 the portion sizes didn't bother me as much. For dessert I had the pumpkin spice bread pudding. It was surprisingly bland. I expected much more after eating such flavourful food during my first two courses. I ended up swapping dessert with my boyfriend who ordered the maple-pecan tart. The tart was rich, sweet and buttery. It was a great way to end a light meal.  Overall, the food was a hit despite the portion sizes. Service on the other hand was absolutely horrible! Our server was excruciatingly slow and inattentive. We were seated for a good 10-15 minutes before our drink orders were taken and our food order wasn't promptly taken after dropping off our drinks. She made us wait another 10 minutes to order! It was unacceptable! I'm sorry to say that the exceptionally bad service overshadowed the exceptionally great food. With so many other great restaurants around the city, you can bet that I won't be coming back to Pangaea."}
{"text":"We have been to the restaurant a few years ago and it was better then as opposed to now.  This time we went to Pangaea for a Winterlicious dinner.  Even though we had reservations at 7 we were not seated until 7:30. My meal was butternut squash soup, bison striploin and pumpkin bread pudding. The soup was delicious. The bison was a major let down. Only 2 tiny slices stacked on mushrooms. The portion of the main was what I would consider a portion of an appetizer. A serious serious let down. Not just because of size but also it didnt taste like anything special. The pumpkin bread pudding was decent. I ate about half. It was very dense and tasted like a dense version of pumpkin pie. My boyfriend got the calamari to start, the bison striploin and the hot chocolate for dessert. He liked the calamari, scoffed at the striploin for the same reasons as I did and really loved his dessert. He said the hot chocolate was so delicious.   Overall the reason why I feel the place has downgraded is when we were here a few years back. There portions were more appropriate. A main course was the size of a main as opposed to an appetizer. I would rate my 3 courses, 2/5 and he would rate his 3.5/5."}
{"text":"I came here for summerlicious last year. I didn't like anything I ordered. The portions were unfathomably small and for such tiny portions I thought it would be jam packed with taste but unfortunately it was bland. I had some beef thing - god it was so tastless. They should serve what's on their regular menu and put effort into making even the summerlicious food taste good. I didnt' even enjoy the dessert!!"}
{"text":"Visited during Winterlicious with friends.  Total: 7 pax.  They were running a bit late.  Had to wait 20 mins so we were quite hungry by 8:40.   For the appetizer, we sampled the mushroom soup, beef carpaccio and pear and endive salad.  The soup was hot and enjoyable.  The carpaccio was also tasteful.  The pear was a mild disappointment, not much taste.  As for entrees, we had the duck breast, striplion and lamb. All delicious & delicately prepared but the portions are rather small.  We all had extra bread.  Desserts:  chocolate cake, crème bulee and lemon stick.  Both chocolate cake and crème bulee were good.  The lemon stick was just ordinary but nice presentation.  Overall a good experience but nothing that really strikes out."}
{"text":"Had an excellent meal.  I had a steak, my lady had lamb shank: both were cooked exactly as requested.  The server was gracious and warm, without being too talkative.  The sommelier came over to chat with us and recommended a wine to suit both of our entrees.    The decor was nice:  perhaps a shade darker would have made the restaurant more intimate for those on a romantic evening out (like we were) but still a wonderful overall experience.  Dinner for 2 plus wine was $350, so we won't be eating there every weekend, but for an occasional treat, you couldn't find better."}
{"text":"Fabulous food, exemplary service.  I am shocked that I had never been before.   We went as a large group for a private function, and secured a private dining room. I had a beet salad appetizer, a chicken main and a dessert selection. All was chosen by the organizers, and I am not sure if they are on the regular menu. Regardless the food was incredible. I ate every last bite of every course. Thoughtfully prepared, seasonal vegetables, everything fresh and delicious. We had wine selected for us by the restaurant which complemented perfectly. Very very impressed.  The servers were of the stealth variety. My glasses were filled and plates cleaned with barely any notice. Fantastic, and I wil return."}
{"text":"The food is good, and the service is nice. Winterlicious is coming, I can now save some money for going to this restaurant now, yeah!"}
{"text":"the waiter is soooooo rude!!!! we just sat down, ordered a round of water and he came over and said 'chop chop, time to order\" like are you kidding me?! it hasn't even been 5 minutes and he's pushing us to order. and he was really snobby, i never thought these type of people existed but apprently they do. he was really rude to my group of friends and I and I even ordered a $40 main course (wayy out of my price range) and he was still so rude to us. personally, the food wasn't that great to me but i'm not sure if it was because the rude/snobby waiter made me not like the food or if i just actually didn't like the food. yeah, i won't be coming here again, this is my first bad review and sorry for the rant but I just wanted to get that out there"}
{"text":"I went for Winterlicious 2013. It was the worst -licious dining event I've ever been to. The servers ranged from being curt to polite but it was likely because they were stressed. However, I came for the food too.  There are stereotypes of stingy customers who know little about fine dining and are too cheap to tip properly, but to be honest, if your restaurant is participating in these events, it's bound to happen. Either pull out of -licious events and deal with the otherwise decrease diners, or do your job and provide quality food and service that meets the restaurant's reputation. My complaint is not on the tiny portions or the slight decrease in quality that happens with these 'discounted' events, but the subpar standards the restaurant sets for its food.  First of all, I didn't order any wine or soda. I actually never have anything besides water with my meals, not because I'm too cheap-- I tend to fill up on beverages so I never drink anything besides water. The waiter respected that, and was polite to refill our water when it was empty. On food, I ordered the quail appetizer. It wasn't awful, but due to the way the quail was cooked, I thought I was eating chicken. I did think the salad it came with was pretty good though. The dessert was delicious, I ordered the pecan tart. My main complaint in the food was the entree.  I ordered the rib eye which came with vegetables. When we were ordering, we were told they were all made 'medium rare' unless we wanted it to be cooked more. Well okay, I understand that considering they're all premade to make it easier on the kitchen staff; however, I didn't understand the fact that it was more like rubber than beef. We asked the waiter for a steak knife and I still had trouble cutting through it. I never finished it, it was just too difficult to chew. I've had better Walmart steaks.  With my friends, one of the dessert unfortunately was missing a part to it, which is unexceptable for dishes which are suppose to be mass produced and prepared ahead of time. It took us quite a bit of time to flag down a waitress to fix that problem, and although she was unapologetic about it and curt in her attitude to sort it out, I'm sure she was just stressed.   I do take advantage of these -licious events to more or less \"test out\" their food without the heavy price tag behind them, and I understand that they will be below their usual quality; but however, these are also events for me to see whether they would be a place I'd like to return to another time outside of these -licious events. I tipped at least 10% because despite everything, the servers should not be responsible for the poor quality of food, nor the fact that they're being stressed out because of these events. Unfortunately, I left hungry because I never even made through half of my entree. I honestly think the portion sizes are acceptable and appropriate for a healthy dining experience, as well as the price tag, so I don't believe people should judge -licious events on that alone.  Sad to say, because of the quality of food, I would never go back."}
{"text":"We hit this place as part of Winterlicous. The ambiance inside the place is quite nice. Up scale. Staff were polite and courteous. They have a reasonable wine list including wines by the glass, half bottle and full bottles. There are wines in a number of the price ranges. We had the Bison Striploin which was good and well cooked. All ingredients were fresh, well prepared and nicely presented. Portions were a bit on the small side even for me and I am not a big eater. Even with Winterlicious prices this place is not cheap. With 2 glasses of wine we were over $130 with tip."}
{"text":"Came here on a night  that I was feeling pretty down and wow did this ever save me. Amazing food and attentive staff! Some of the top in yorkville thats for sure!"}
{"text":"FOOD POISONING! I got a horrible bout after eating off the winterlicious menu in January 2012.  The management did not deal accordingly with my complaint. Diners beware.."}
{"text":"We went to Pangaea on a Friday night for Summerlicious. We made reservations for 7 PM, four people. We were seated as soon as arriving and approached by our waitress not too long after sitting down. I'm not sure if she just had an \"off\" sense of humour or whether she was actually trying to be pretentious, but she noticed that I had been looking at their wine list and must have overheard my comment to my partner about a $400 bottle of wine. She started laughing and asked if we'd actually be getting the $400 bottle of wine, suggesting that they have even more expensive wine in the back if we'd prefer. It was snarky, uncalled for and rude. You don't know me, you don't know whether I'm the type who'd spend that much money on a bottle of wine. Keep your snide remarks to yourself, lady. Right off the bat, I wasn't pleased with her.   The rest of our party arrived. The waitress literally appeared out of nowhere, interrupted our conversation and started describing the day's soup and wine. Extremely rude. No greeting, no acknowledgement whatsoever. She just started spouting words out of no where. And when we were ready to order our food, she brought up the expensive wine again, with a little laugh and smirk, like, And no $400 wine for you tonight after all? Hehe.   Please, give me a break.   The food came. We ate. Bottom line is, it wasn't spectacular. The portions were tiny, and the food wasn't unique or tasty enough for them to be able to pull off that minimalist look on the plate. Things were underseasoned. There was just nothing special about anything I ate. I ordered the tuna tartare to start, then the lamb x 3 and finished off with the lemon bar. The lamb was okay. Nothing to write home about. The lemon bar was overpowering in flavour (not in a good way - way too lemony) and too frozen. The tuna was probably the highlight of the meal.   We were forgotten about for the rest of the night. No body came around to ask how our meals were. We waited for the waitress to come by so we could ask for the check and we probably sat around an extra hour all together because she was no where to be found. Our bill was tossed on to our table, and she disappeared again. Admittedly, it got pretty busy in there, but her behaviour was just careless.   I won't go back."}
{"text":"The most difficult thing to find during noon on a Saturday is a quiet lunch in Yorkville.   We needed a break. Navigating the departments at Holt's, riding the never-ending escalators of Harry Rosen, and roaming from store to store on Bloor while enduring that awful construction, yes, we needed a break. I decided whichever the first restaurant North on Bay would do, and that very quickly revealed itself to be Pangaea.  It was one O'clock, the place was virtually empty, and I never thought I'd be happy for it being so. Peace, at last! The bread arrived as soon as we took our seats. With spread, Thank God! \"I'll have the grilled capon breast with mashed potatoes, carrots, green beans, and black truffle jus.\"  \"Very well, Sir.\" Melanie order the Veal Osso Bucco. I don't think I've ever gotten food ordering over with so fast, carrying all those bags really worked up an appetite. We debated on a chardonnay, but that's as far as we ever gotten.  Something about the place gave off an Ocean Cruise liner vibe, if we hadn't taken the window seat, I would have thought I was on a ship. The chairs were actually more comfortable than it looked, everything was so...clean. The helping of bread was generous, so the wait for the food went unnoticed. Our waiter was very knowledgeable, 50 years old tops, the Man certainly had character. Melanie thought he was cute. I had to agree. We ate our entire meal in soothing silence. All of the jackhammering and vicious honking never for a second penetrated the glass of Pangaea.   The capon breast was very tender, and the vegetables were perfectly cooked. All praises from Melanie as well. It felt like we've unintentionally chosen a health-conscious eatery. That's what the food suggested.  The private dining room at the back keeps distracting me, and before we left, I asked for a walkabout into the area. We were the only ones there, so they were more than happy to cater to my curiosity.    An hour, that was all that it took for us to comfortably have our lunch. Can't complain! Refueled, re-energized. Time to tackle the rest of bourgeois Toronto."}
{"text":"Wonderful dinner at Pangaea during winterlicious.  Mushroom Soup w/Truffle Foam. 3/5. Like some of the other reviewers, I think it needed a bit of seasoning. Fois Gras Torchon. 5/5. A highlight. Silky smooth, rich, and beautifully paired with grape confit.  Scallops w/Pearl Barley Risotto. 4/5. Melt in your mouth scallops, good risotto, but the overall dish could have used a bit more 'oomph' to make it a 5/5. Bison. 5/5 A knockout dish that I could have gone back for seconds. Chocolate Cake. 4/5. Great icing, but didn't jump off our plate. Cheese Plate. 5/5. Beautiful cheeses, and great accompaniments.   Small portion sizes aside, a great dinner; and I'd happily come back on a non-Winterlicious night."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with my cousin on the recommendation of a friend. We did not have a reservation but we were able to be seated nonetheless. The decor was nice and cozy. It reminded me of someone's dining room rather than a restaurant.   We ordered the Lamb Shank and the Roast Beef Sandwich. The bread came with something called Beet Butter and it was really good. It was sweet but not too sweet and the texture was a bit thicker than butter. The Roast Beef Sandwich came with fries, which unfortunately was the best part of the meal. It was crunchy and seasoned with salt and basil. The sandwich itself was small and the bread was overly toasted and so hard that it was not edible.  The Lamb was also really small for $26 and not as flavored and tender as we had expected. It came with 2 pieces of asparagus.   Our bill came to a total of about $60 without wine and I had wanted to get dessert but I was so disappointed with the meal that we opted to go across the street and get Pusateri's instead."}
{"text":"Came here after work for Winterlicious.  Atmosphere was very nice and intimate. Definitely a good restaurant to come to for a date.  Crowd I would say is 26+.    Had the beef carpaccio, which consisted of parmesan cheese, lemon confit, compressed cucumbers and black olives. Very lovely starter appetizer, as I enjoyed the meat. For the main, I had beef strip loin and the Ontario cheese plate.   My friend had the lamb, which was oven roasted and served with barley, mustard seed, raisins, ginger and almonds.   Overall, I probably regretted picking my strip loin as it was not enough to fill me. The lamb was cooked perfectly and my friend enjoyed it. Ideally this is a restaurant where portions do not fill you. Ontario cheese plate was pretty generic but still good.   Nothing really stands out to me about this restaurant and the food was good but nothing too special."}
{"text":"Fantastic Food! above average service.  Since we were in Toronto for only 2 days we decided to see what the city had to offer in the area of fine dining.  We were recommended to try this place by a lady who was in charge of the cookbook store around the corner (who better to recommend than a person working at a cookbook store right).  The Chef makes all the cheese required for the dishes and has a tasting platter of the house made cheeses as well. We decided to start with the 6 Cheese platter.  The cheese portions were just right paired with some Fiji Apples, so tasty!!!!  Among the cheese, the chefs cow's milk blue was amazing (i couldn't believe i said blue cheese and amazing int he same line). The Beet salad with baked goat cheese for appetizer -delicious!!!.  I am a sucker for Mushroom Risotto, if I see it on the menu I have to have it which is exactly what I did here as well.  The Risotto was cooked to perfection, my only critic there could have been more mushrooms and little less of greens.  We almost skipped the dessert, but we changed our mind and ordered the Citrus Ricotta filled warm Doughnuts with Orange Cardamom Milk Shake to share.  I have never ever been so happy to have ordered dessert ever in my life.  The milkshake surprisingly was very light and the orange+cardamom was a perfect complement to the cinnamon sugar dusted doughnuts. .  The folks get extra points for splitting the milkshake 3 ways before serving.   All in all props to the chef for creating such wonderful dishes.  If I am ever back in Toronto, am definitely going here again."}
{"text":"Had a winterlicious lunch last week, sorry to update after winterlicious ended and couldn't stop those who went here to eat.  Atmosphere, ok. Service, alright. He refilled our waters, gave us enough time to order but after our main came and I had to return my dish, couldn't get him to come over for very long. (And it was around 3:30, only 2 other tables) Food, not what I expected for the price and the area of yorkville.  I don't know what was the cause (most likely my undercooked steamed trout) I had a very bad nausea and diarrhea after eating here, (I had nothing other than their food that day) and had to run to the emergency at night because I'm due in a month and it was life risking!   What made me sad is when we called our sever to come and asked about undercooked trout, he said \"it's supposed to be like that\" when it was sashimi raw. We were still concerned about it so asked to cook a little more and he did take it back, actually came back with a brand new dish (after my husband finished his main) which is nice, but said \"sorry it was actually a little undercooked\".  So,,,ok. If you don't know how the dish is \"supposed\" to look like, don't assume and deny when your customer finds it wrong or not right.   There are a lot better choice in this area, so we won't come back here to get another hard night in the washroom."}
{"text":"I came to Pangea with some friends and it was a really good experience.  First I have to say the restaurant did a great job at catering to my Lactose/Gluten free diet.  Second, our waiter was really attentive, which I think is uber important.  Our meals were all delicious and the ambiance was nice.  The portions were on the smaller side (expected of high end restaurants) but we all left satisfied.  I started with a cold melon soup which was really good.  I normally eat really healthy so it was something I could see myself enjoying as a dessert.  I highly recommend it if you would like to try something different and sweet.  Next I had the Halibut and Octopus dinner.  The halibut was plain and not too flavourful but the octopus definitely made up for this.  The Octopus was amazing and super delicious.  It had almost a butter flavour but it wasn't buttery.  It was just scrumptious!  For dessert I had three flavours of sorbet.  I could immediately tell that they were made from real fruit and were not store bought.  The sorbet was the perfect dessert to end my meal.  Some of my friends enjoyed the Tomato and Mozzarella Salad, Duck breast, Strawberry Shortcake (Out of this world but not gluten free), and the vegetarian risotto.  They all really enjoyed their dishes.  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"We love Pangaea. Had not been here in a number of years, and it was very busy because it was also Winterlicious. Regardless, the service and food remain exceptional. We love the feel here. It's a very upscale Yorkville restaurant, with a stunning interior, yet the service and attitude is comfortable and anything but stiff. Watching floor staff is like watching a symphony. Everyone knows their part to keep things moving. The food is so creative and fresh. Worth every cent. Especially for a special occasion, this is a wonderful place to be."}
{"text":"This second time around didn't quite live up the fantastic memories I had of the place, but we still quite enjoyed this restaurant for Winterlicious 2012.  Portions - tiny Food - oh-so-very-very rich  The paper thin slices of duck breast were ridiculous small to look at, but a very delicious, fatty, hefty and rich experience in the mouth.  It's definitely more substantial than it looked.  The seafood paella - oh-so-rich - and tasty - not that memorable though.  The weighty pumpkin spiced bread pudding completely filled out the corners left by the small portions of the previous courses.  While delicious, it was served lukewarm, and I'm not quite sure why.  Service - fantastic Atmosphere - a bit loud, but appropriately dark and refined  A good choice for a nice evening out to impress your date."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat. The presentation could be worked on a little. The food most of the time has a good collaboration of flavours, but sometimes they're a little off on certain dishes. The fish is delicious here, with a nice blend of veggies and delicious sauces.   I enjoy most the 1$ oysters on Wednesday and Thursday's !! And btw it is easy to park to eat here too."}
{"text":"My friends booked a table for 6 during Winterlicious and we were made to feel like less of customers because of this. We're regular foodies, so this was disappointing to us. Our portions were actually too small to be fulfilling, and I'm usually someone who only eats half my meal if that gives you an idea. We waited long periods for our server, he was short and rude, and he admitted that the portions were scaled back for Winterlicious (so you're not actually getting a good deal, just less food). My partner and I bought a $50 bottle of wine with our reduced meals, and we still felt a little less than the average customer. The food tasted good and that's what gave them two stars instead of one. Also, I awkwardly hung my coat on the back of my chair only to find out when I left that they were supposed to check my coat, so I had a big red coat hanging off my chair the whole time when no one else did. Service needs improvement. It may've been Winterlicious, but my partner and I still did spend $160 for the meal ($80 pp)."}
{"text":"I went here for winterlicious lunch with my friends because I remember it being pretty good few years back.   I ordered the pear/endive salad, chicken main, and cinnamon panna cotta. I liked the sound and idea of each dish but it didn't deliver as much as I hoped. They were all presented well and tasted okay but there wasn't anything outstanding. But I mean $23 for 3 dishes, I can't complain. My friends complained how the dishes didn't fill them enough as well.  It was a good experience overall with good service but I don't think I will back for the winterlicious menu!"}
{"text":"I was whisked away into this restaurant for a romantic dinner a deux.  The food was very sexy and the sommelier treated us so wonderfully well.  We had intention of starting the night with a bottle of champagne and then ending it with a bottle of red because we both chose meat entrees.  We had a tender amuse bouche of trout ceviche, which definitely Set the tone for the evening.  We shared the crab cakes as an appetizer, which perfectly complemented our drink.   They accompanied it with lovely avocado mash giving it a velvety texture.  We are meat eaters  so inspite of the fact that this place had lots of beautiful and responsibly sourced seafood, we still opted for the meat; I had the lamb chops and he had the rib eye steak.  They were classically well cooked.  The lamb was crusted with crispy bits of nuts and garlic and cooked to a perfect medium.  The ribeye steak was charred and smoky but cooked to liking inside.  At that point, we realized we have not finished the champagne so we asked for a glass of red each.  The sommelier brought us a great California Cab-Sauv that actually smelled like California at the first whiff.  California dreamin'.  As my boyfriend said, he always hesitates to order steak at a place that is not a steakhouse but Pangaea is not one of those places.  I ended our meal with dessert, which was called the Chocolate bar, a deconstructed Milky way.  It was rich and decadent and unfortunately too rich to finish.  Sated, full and a little tipsy, I was whisked away home with tender and delightful memories of Pangaea."}
{"text":"What better way to end my week of irresponsible Summerlicious-ing than with 20 of my dearest friends?  I want to thank each and every one of you for making my 25th so memorable.  I had called around to several restaurants prior to the official Summerlicious start date, and few restaurants had availability to accommodate a party of 20.  Pangaea was one of the few places that could meet this requirement.  I had previously dined at Pangaea during non-'licious time and had quite a good dining experience.  However, with Summerlicious it can sometimes be a hit and miss in terms of how the food and service reflect the norm.  After my experience this time, I wonder if Pangaea falls into that category...  Being a party of 25, it was not possible to seat everyone at the same table.  We were placed into what would be the private dining room which they inevitably opened up no doubt to accommodate a full house during this promotional period.  Our server was well-mannered and always provided smile with a service.  We weren't given a hard time even though I arrived 30 minutes past the reservation time.  We were not hurried.  A bread basket with Beet Butter was brought to our tables prior to the commencement of our meals.  When the bread was consumed, our server quickly refilled it.  I ordered a bottle of Riesling and it had hints of citrus in it without being too dry.  This rang in at $50.  For starters, I ordered the Beet & Goat Cheese Salad.  Although the description includes fried ginger and radish seedlings, I didn't taste either of these ingredients in the salad.  The goat cheese was presented as a circular disk, as were the beets.  The sweet flavour from the beets balanced out an otherwise salty goat's cheese.  It was nice and light.  Unfortunately I neglected to take a picture of my main, but I had the Venison which was served on a bed of bacon, Napa cabbage, mushrooms and apricot jus.  To me, the veggies were tastier than the actual meat. The food was only lukewarm, probably because they wanted to have all the dishes ready to serve and kept several dishes on warming plates.  I like my food piping hot. As for dessert, I ordered the Pavlova.  I am a fan of meringue, so I thought I would love the pavlova.  But again I was disappointed.  The pavlova was way too sweet and lacked in freshness.  Verdict:  The portion sizes are quite small at Pangaea when you compare them to other Summerlicious participants.  Although the service was good, the same cannot be said about the food.  This was a totally different dining experience from when I paid regular prices to dine at Pangaea."}
{"text":"Went to Pangaea for their Summerlicious dinner menu, and it was one of the best meals I've had in ages! I highly recommend it! Although this place would normally been a bit out of my price range, the $35 fixed price menu was a fabulous deal.   I got the squid ink linguine as my main, it was perfect! SOooooo good! Even the bread passed around before the meal was fresh and delicious. A very classy restaurant, the waiters seemed a little snarky at first (and I always feel a little bad for getting such a good Summerlicious deal) but they were still attentive and once we were friendly to them, they were more friendly to us.  Be aware, this is one of those fancy restaurants that serves small portions."}
{"text":"In town for business, I was looking for a restaurant that exhibited a consciousness about the food they served.  I prefer meat from animals that are raised properly on small farms; fish that is sustainably caught; and vegetables and fruit that is in season locally.  Luckily there are lots of places in Toronto that cater to PITAs like me.  I ran by this place and Earth after work that espoused environmental consciousness.  Since Pangaea was closer to my hotel and it was late, I went there.    Pangaea is associated with a conservation program called Ocean Wise  that helps chefs make environmentally responsible choices on ingredients and suppliers.  Although I've never heard of the organization, it's mentioned prominently on the menu.   Pangaea is a seafood place.  Meat makes a cameo appearance on the menu, but given the wide selection of and heavy emphasis on fish, I'm not sure why one would choose a meat dish unless you don't like fish and walked into the wrong place.  The by the glass wine menu looked good enough.  I  am surprised that I drink enough red wine to recognize labels and know if they're good (to me).  I dislike the Grayson cabernet so had a Finca Martha Malbec that was pretty good at C$11/glass.  The second glass was a much heavier pour than the first, which was already pretty good.  The menu lists small plates, starters and mains.  My server said that small plates were very small servings, which was perfect for me.  I had a tasty slice of scallop on a piece of pork belly.    My main was the Haddock special, served on green veggies and fingerling potatoes. The dish was served from the kitchen so quickly that I could taste the fresh heat of the pan on the potatoes; that really knocked me out. The serving wasn't huge, which I was thankful for, since I hate getting giant servings that I can't finish or have to take home.  The fish was flakey and perfectly done.  Without much effort, the waiter talked me into having a chocolate bar for dessert, which is a frozen chocolate mousse on a meringue cracker (sort of looked like a crispy Pop Tart) with a caramelized pear.  The pear itself was pretty awesome.  The frozen mousse was much creamier than a sorbet.  Downsides: It isn't the most expensive place I've been, but it ain't cheap.  The room was much larger than I expected - you can't really tell from outside - and the setting and ambiance of the room was more formal than I expected.  That doesn't really have much to do with the food or service, but the set up of the room, decor, etc. didn't really make me comfortable.   Service was outgoing, friendly and helpful, and knowledgeable about the menu.  If I was there for work, I'd certainly visit again."}
{"text":"I don't often write reviews of restaurants, however when restaurants consistently exceed expectations, I am compelled to. Also, I find it truly awful that the first reviews that come up are from Summer-vicious clientele. Foodies in Toronto don't go out during the \"licous\" seasons, they stay at home and say slient prayers for restaurant staff. It is not the appropriate time to review a restaurant. Having dined at Pangaea on numerous occasions, I can provide a more complete picture of what you can expect from this Toronto icon.   Pangaea is dedicated to sustainable fish; you'll find a thoughtful and well-executed array of ocean-wise seafood dishes. The Chef du Cuisine prepares the cheese for the cheese board in house. Some will understand what a significant achievement this is. This sums up the attitude of the kitchen- experimental and thoughtful preparation of sustainable products.  They have won awards for risotto. @Thomas R., servers in fine dining restaurants would never tell you the price if you don't ask. That would be seen as extremely rude. But I digress.   A friend took me to Pangaea last month for a birthday lunch. Service was warm and friendly. The mushroom risotto was, as always, delicious. Steamed Halibut with shaved truffles was perfectly executed, tender and moist. The crab cake is extremely flavourful and not to be missed. The daily selection of cheese was varied, and did not disappoint.   It really doesn't matter what you order here, it will be delicious. It doesn't matter who serves you, they will be knowledgable and attentive. If you have someone to impress, take them to Pangaea."}
{"text":"Cool name, splendid food, and rock-solid service. My drink? Scotch and soda this time. It seemed right on a warm summer day with oysters on the agenda. My dad had a decent Manhattan. As you may have heard, you can purchase the book \"Pangaea: Why It Tastes So Good\" on the premises. That's funny, and you have to admire their panache."}
{"text":"Came here for Winterlicious lunch and had a pleasant time. Food was great and nicely plated, and the server was attentive and very friendly. I ordered the beef carpaccio, mushroom risotto, and chocolate cake, while my bf ordered the pear and endive salad, lamb and creme brulee. I loved all but the cake; it was a little dense and hard."}
{"text":"Amazing food, fantastic ambience, and great service.  I went to Pangaea on Monday, Feb 7, 2011 for a Winterlicious dinner with three of my friends. Our server quickly greeted me upon arrival and gave me some bread that my party had already been munching on. There seemed to be a roasted red pepper spread in the middle of the table that was delicious, but I just wasn't sure what it was.  I ordered the trout gravlax, the mahi mahi, and the hot chocolate for my three courses. The trout was full of flavour and complemented perfectly with the potato rosti underneath it. The mahi mahi was sitting in this wonderful chowder full of delicious sea food and the mahi mahi itself was cooked perfectly. The hot chocolate was a perfect way to end the meal on a cold winter day, and the scone and vanilla bean marshmallows were great sidekicks for the hot chocolate.  As my party and I were getting ready to leave, Chef Martin came out and I introduced myself as the fellow who had a brief exchange with him on Twitter the week before. He asked if we were in a rush, and when we said we weren't, he came back with a bottle of 10 year old port and poured us each a glass. A personal touch that was a wonderful end to a great meal.  Thank you Chef Martin for making an amazing meal and an even better experience. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"The food was good, the servers were friendly and efficient.  Lovely presentation."}
{"text":"I am so glad I have an expense account and can afford lunch at Pangaea!  The owner/manager impressed us with a quality bottle of Sauvignon Blanc that I have never seen in an LCBO. The wine list is enormous, and we were lucky to have the personal recommendation of the owner. He was very friendly.  I started with a plate filled with thinly sliced beets topped with a large dollop of smooth and creamy goat's cheese. My entree was a serving of extra-large scallops mixed with green beans, mushrooms and spinach. It was truly delicious. That beet salad is huge and filling. I really didn't even need an entree after that!  The room is very big with high ceilings and comfortable tall chairs. The atmosphere is fairly formal but not stiff.  It is a big room and gets popular at lunch, but it never gets loud. I appreciate that as often I am there for business lunches, and like to hear my companions talk.  Another plus is you can make your reservations online through open table, which makes life easier sometimes.  I have eaten lunch at Pangaea (on expense account) time after time and have always thoroughly enjoyed the food. The service is also always impeccable. The servers are there when you need them and know their stuff.  All in all, a great place for lunch if you can afford it."}
{"text":"First time here with a group of 6 - three couples - for Summerlicious 2015, $35pp.  We all ordered different appetizers, mains, desserts... and ended up ordering almost the entire Summerlicious menu between 6 people so we tried everything. I don't think a single person was unhappy with anything. A pitcher of sangria was easily shared between 6 people.  Beautiful presentations, delicate balance of flavours with some creative ingredient offerings, perfect portion sizes to satisfy even the big eaters in the group. And plenty of local, sustainable ingredients. Could we ask for more?  Some of our group's favourite dishes (pics of all 5 below):  - Seafood salad appetizer - Duck main course - Trout main course - Panna cotta dessert (just order it and thank me later!) - Chocolate cake  We also need to commend the top-notch service. We dressed up a bit for a special evening, but I noticed even the customers who were more casually dressed we receiving equally attentive service.   VERY impressed. Would definitely come back for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Clean basic interior.  I ordered from the summerlicious menu.  My appetizer, Lamb Sausages: Grilled, on pearl barley with Stilton, grape tomato & wilted mustard greens. Taste, moisture levels were good, but portions was quite small.  The main, Speckled Trout: Amandine, broiled on long beans with almonds, steamed new potatoes, brown butter & lemon. My main was very tasty but my portions were so abysmally small.  For Dessert, Artisanal Cheese Selection: Three varieties of Local cheese with walnuts, amber honey & pear compote. The cheeses were alright & it was neat combining it with nuts & sweet petrified fruits. I liked the dessert  very much.   Overall service here was attentive & quick, but the portion sizes are quite depressingly small."}
{"text":"I'm sure taking advantage of SUMMERLICIOUS ALRIGHT! lol Conveniently across the Bay subway station on the North east corner of Bay and Bloor is Pangaea.  Though this place looks small and narrow outside, its definintely deceiving.  Beautiful contemporary decor, with a few sculpted fixtures, and paintings, its definitely a place to try.    Our server was knowlegably helpful in assisting us in recommendations, and we were satisfied. I ended up having the:   Hot Soup of the day: which was an asparagus puree soup 4.5/5, beautiful color and texture with a nice drop of cream in the center.  Great presentation!!  entree was Brined & Roasted Pork Loin 5/5 Smoked celeriac puree, stewed peppers, sweet & spicy golden raisins the celeriac puree helped diversify the flavor of the pork as it is a blander meat, and thankfully it was not a sweet puree which really complimented the sweet and spicy golden raisins, and brought an overal flavorful dish....  Dessert was the Raspberry Semifreddo  Shortbread cookie, raspberry compote, lime caramel, white chocolate curl.  The shortbread was very soft, which complimented the semifreddo that was topped off with with chocolate curl....perfect way to top off a perfect lunch."}
{"text":"Service was good, but the portions were laughably small, even for a summerlicious menu. I do not mind a conservative portion but the taste did not make up for it. Pretty to look at, but nothing overly flavourful. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Came to Pangaea for  lunch today to get in one last winterlicious meal before it ends. We were a group of 4 and the service was at the front door was warm and welcoming. Our waiter was attentive but not very friendly or warm. The restaurant atmosphere was quite nice.  For appetizer I had the daily soup which was mushroom soup with truffle foam on top. The soup was pretty good but could have done with some pepper. Which you have to ask for since salt and pepper are offered only on request.   For main I had the bison and it was my first time having bison. It was cooked medium rare, just how I like it. It was quite flavourful and presented very nicely. It came with a little pickled cabbage which was not that great but it was mild in taste which was good. The portion was rather small but enough for me. I didn't really care for the sauces that they had streaked over the plate and would have preferred a different side instead of the cabbage.  For dessert I had the Crème brulee which was delicious!! nice hard sugar on top and nice soft creamy filling in the middle!  It also came with a ginger snap biscotti which was ok but the cinnamon pear was gross. There was way too much cinnamon on the pair that it was spicy and overwhelming.   Would go back for winterlicious but not at regular price. Portions are quite small for the price you are paying. All in all the food was good and the place it nice."}
{"text":"Was super impressed this time. I went for summerlicious for the last two times and thought the food was ok only. But this time, we went for a full dinner and it was so much better. Based on the reviews below, I think the key to this place is to go for regular service and not during the summer/winterlicious events.   Appetizers we had the 100km salad, the risotto, and the grilled calamari. All were done perfectly and the table agreed that the risotto was the best we've ever had (right amount of creaminess and crunch).   Mains we had the trout, halibut, and pork loin. I thought the fish were better than the pork loin, and the presentations were gorgeous and the grilled veggies on the side were really great too.   Finished the meal off with mille feuille - perfect end to a meal! Oh and olive bread accompanies the meal at the beginning too : )"}
{"text":"Fancy-dancy from start to finish. The first thing I ate here was just bread and butter, but wow, way to set the bar with freaking roasted pear butter! Are you kidding, roasted pear butter?! I could have just eaten this like pudding and been happy as a clam. I need to learn how to make this magic butter.  Next was gravlax, which was very light and surprisingly I didn't mind the fennel at all, nicely done. I had artic char for my entree, it was alright but not really anything special. Now what I originally came here for: dessert. Doughnut holes filled with ricotta (and orange?) cream and served with some kind yum milkshake. Very satisfying.   Service was awesome, the place is a bit formal and business-y but that's ok.   Now all I need is more pear butter and \"crusty french\" bread."}
{"text":"Winterlicious lunch here was quite pleasant. One of my favourite places to go to in the city. Service was excellent and welcoming and we were seated right away.  Appetizer was beef carpaccio which had quite a bit going on. I had a hard time appreciating the flavours but the presentation was spectacular. Main course was the lamb which was quite disappointing. A very tough piece of meat, but I can still say that the seasoning was excellent.  Dessert was a very dense chocolate cake which I liked but my colleague didn't.   Overall, the ambience of Pangaea is wonderful and great for a nice lunch/dinner. I have had previous experience with this place and fantastic cuisine, but I have to say that this lunch was not as appealing as expected. Will still come back here knowing their full potential."}
{"text":"My second restaurant of Summerlicious 2010.  I went for lunch with about 6 of my friends on a Saturday.  I ordered the following:  - Chilled Fruit Puree - Grilled Sirloin Beef - White Chocolate Panna Cotta  The chilled fruit purre was an interesting started since it was sweet (yet had a little kick due to ginger).  However, I didn't really like it very much due to the sweetness to begin my lunch.  If I were to redo my lunch selections, I would've chosen the serrano ham as my starter.  As for the entrees.  It seems like the entrees were VERY small (but in the end, still quite filling).  The sirloin was much better than the lamb, in my opinion.  Not much, but it was still fairly good.  I think the dessert was our favourites.  No one got the cheese dish.  The panna cotta was absolutely delicious and well-presented.  I have no complaints with that.  Service was a bit slow that day.  We were there for quite a while.  Granted, it was quite busy, but I felt like the service could have been MUCH better.  Would I recommend this for Summerlicious/Winterlicious?  Not really."}
{"text":"On my way to an evening class, I decided to check out Pangaea as it was close it happened to be on the Summerlicious 2014 participating list.  I booked a 4:45PM to be sure I had a spot. But given it was a Tuesday, the restaurant would not be as busy at that time. As soon as I arrived a manager and some servers greeted me and noted my booking as well as request to be finished within an hour.  I was asked to choose between the lunch and dinner menu.  I decided on the dinner menu.    I got a seat by the window next to Bay St near the after work rush.  The restaurant itself had high ceilings and simple décor. A rare experience to view life in Yorkville.   The standard bread offering came first. The waiter made sure the glass was always full of water. He asked how the food was and was very courteous.  The dinner menu was a 3 course meal with about 4 options for each.  Within 10 minutes of ordering the Tomato and Mozzarella Salad with fresh basil, olives, onion, vincotta dressing had arrived. It was light with right amount of dressing and quite good.  The main course was duck with  carrot puree, and roasted root vegetables. The emphasis was on local ingredients. The duck was the best prepared part of the main course.  I was not totally sold on some of the vegetables.  Summerlicious dishes attempt to give a small taste of the offerings of restaurants.  The main course appeared to be a bit experimental in terms of taste.  The desert was a lemon bar - more like a cheese cake with raspberry sauce on the side and topped with lemon meringue. A bit sweet for my taste but well prepared.  All in all, a good experience at Pangaea .  Although a bit pricey - worth to try."}
{"text":"I've been to Pangaea three times, twice for Winterlicious and once for their regular menu.  First Winterlicious in 2013 impressed me a lot, I still remember the quail app which was deliciously tender.  This led me to try their regular menu afterwards, where I had the duck confit that was also extremely flavourful.  Unfortunately, the Winterlicious menu I had this year was a bit disappointing.  Starter - Beef Carpaccio; Parmesan cheese, lemon confit, compressed cucumber, black olives.  I'm sorry.. this combination was just weird.  You can call my taste buds unrefined but aside from my hate for black olives, the combination of cheese and lemon confit tasted rather strange with the beef carpaccio.  I think anything sweet with beef carpaccio is a little off, the combination of the lemon and parmesan just poked me in all the wrong ways.    Main - Roasted Leg of Lamb; On creamy gorgonzola and rosemary barley.  Hm... okay, this was pretty good.  The blackened part of the lamb in the photo tasted more flavour than the rest of the lamb.  It was not the best Winterlicious main I had by far, but definitely miles better than the starter.  Dessert - Ontario cheese plate.  Standard cheese plate with fruit compote and honey, cannot remember for the life of me the different types of cheese I had, but it was enjoyable, I'll leave it at that  Overall, four stars because my first two experiences were great and I feel like my Winterlicious experience this year was dampened too quickly by the strange starter.   Another worthy resto in Yorkville."}
{"text":"I came here with a group for my friend's birthday party. They were a bit late seating us which was fine because we were quite a large party.  We all went for the Summerlicious menu ($35). I got the tuna tartare (with shaved radish, coriander, Shibori yuzu gel, crisp shallots), three way lamb (oven roasted lamb loin, charred lamb sweetbreads, sous-vide lamb kidney on cous cous with mustard seed, raisins, ginger, almonds) and summer berry shortcake (marinated fresh berries, hot milk cake, vanilla whipped cream).  The tuna tartare tasted good and it was very standard to me. The presentation of the three way lamb was incredibly unappetizing. Good thing the actual food tasted better than it looked. My favourite part of the dish was the sweetbreads. The biggest disappointment was the shortcake. The cake was thickly cut and dry. The presentation was average and the amount of cake to berry was off.  Overall, the flavours of the dishes were above average but the presentation was below average. After this Summerlicious experience, I don't think I'll be coming back for their regular menu because the meal just didn't wow me."}
{"text":"The service was excellent, but I wasn't over the moon with Pangaea.  My striped bass was very bland, and they subbed out my fava bean puree for fennel. I LOVE FAVA BEANS and I HATE FENNEL. But it was a business lunch, so I didn't speak up.   The semifreddo desert with poached plums & cherries and a gluten-free meringue melted in my mouth...well, more like disintegrated in my mouth...in the most delightful way.  Again, the service was 5-star-- warm, personable, professional and thoughtful-- seamlessly. I really don't think our server realized the collateral damage caused by the fennel fiasco, and for that I forgive.   The place was a bit of a scene, but had some private \"nooks\" where we had a lingering 3 hour lunch without too much distraction.  Go for desert."}
{"text":"Went for winterlicious 2014 and were instantly overwhelmed by the great variety of menu items. I ended up going with the bison tenderloin option which was tasty, however portion size was lacking a little for the $35 price tag.  My group had a varied choice of dishes and the consensus was tasty food, though everything could have had a bit more seasoning, and tiny portions all around.   Service was quick and helpful, especially when dealing with a chipped wineglass. Overall good experience, but due to mildly seasoned food and elevated prices I'll probably try many other restaurants before circling back to this one."}
{"text":"I've been going to Pangaea for at least 15 years now, very sporadically.  It's a good place to take out-of-town acquaintances for something formal where you can actually have a conversation without yelling.  It just doesn't ever live up to the expectations it sets up.  Yes, the food is fancy and has depth, but there is always something \"meh\" about one of the dimensions. And always one sprig of something too many. They are toying with pretentious and get burnt sometimes.  The service WANTS to be high-end, but it's always that overly-self-conscious \"we are supposed to be high-end\". It doesn't come naturally, as it does at Opus, or as it did at BoBa. And then there's that really obnoxious French waiter who confirms the horrible preconception about all French waiters. If I wanted someone to tell me what I will enjoy today I would ask someone who actually knows me.  And in case you were wondering why I keep going back... I _really_ like the concept they are trying to live up to. And I have a really lousy memory for negatives."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now - no doubt, it's a popular place and i appreciate the size of the restaurant (helps alleviate wait times a little). But i really think the size is the place's shortfall.  The food is nice - on the upside of good cuisine but It just always seems like the restaurant, food and service is just not at its full potential. It's almost like it's just missing the mark on being food that you remember and service that you appreciate by just  a couple of points.   Needless to say, this is a good place for groups if you need a nice restaurant to get together for a birthday or something that is casual but still somewhat upscale."}
{"text":"Unlike others, I was here for the buck-a-shuck oyster deal. The deal is on every Wednesday and Thursday, starting at 4pm.  So I reserved a table for 8 and 3 of us were there first. I was very impressive with the service, very welcoming and friendly. We dressed in jeans and tees, with backpacks and messy hair. We didn't dress formal enough compare to other customers around (some restaurants will treat you differently if you don't dress nice). However, they still asked if we want to check our coats. Then he showed us to our table at the bar section. Since it's the bar section, the decor is more relaxing, not as formal and fancy as the dining room.  While waiting for the other 5, the waitress kept coming back to make sure our glasses of water are always full and to check if we want to order another beer.  We ordered a dozen each. Its oysters were fresh, and they are bigger than other places who have the same deal. I was a bit sad because they don't have a variety of sauces for oysters like Nome.   Since we ordered a dozen each ( 96 oysters in total), they only brought us 72 on the first round and forgot the second round. We reminded the waitress and she apologized right away. She brought us the rest and said the chef wanted to apologize as well. It was worth the wait for the oysters.  Excellent service, good deal for oysters, and they are all fresh and yummy. I will definitely come back here. If you're looking for oyster deals, Pangea is one of the great choices."}
{"text":"Outstanding find at every level. We are New Yorkers and my wife and I had some work at the TD Canada Trust bank on Bloor street before we had to take an afternoon flight back home. We called the restaurant at 11:20 (they open at 11:30 am) saying we were pressed for time and they let us in and seated us promptly (we had no reservations of course).  My wife is vegetarian so they put together a wonderful pasta dish with veggies in a tomato based sauce that was simply outstanding. I ordered their cod entree which too was superb.  The food arrived within 10-12 minutes of our ordering.    The staff deserve an A+ for service and the chef for the quality of food.   The decor is understated with a nice local touch - there are three photographs mounted on the wall across from the bar which were taken by a local photographer and depicted wintry scenes and are changed based on the season.   Definitely worth a second visit on our next trip to Toronto."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner on a whim, and oh what a delicious whim it proved to be!   For an appetizer, I had the chilled melon soup which was perfect on a warm evening in September & my husband raves over the grilled calamari. I selected the mushroom risotto for my main, which was delightfully creamy but still light with shaved green beans and cherry tomatoes garnishing the brothy risotto. My husband had the homemade gnocchi which literally melted in his mouth. For dessert, I sampled the coconut and banana tart while he had the fresh berries with light flaky pastry. This meal was great from start to finish.   I did not provide 5 stars because our waiter was lacking in charm and personality. He acted as if he didn't really care. However, the servers and maître'd were extremely attentive, so I may chalk this up to a bad night for him."}
{"text":"Pangaea is located just north of Bloor and Bay in the downtown of the city. In celebration of Father's Day, my family came here for dinner on a Saturday evening at about 6:30. After seeing reviews online of this place, I was really wary of it but since my brother suggested it and he and my dad had both been here, I went along.  We arrived a bit early and were surprised to find the restaurant completely empty. Usually not a good sign but we pressed on. I ended up ordering the grilled calamari for an appetizer, the steak for my main and banana coconut tart for dessert.   We were served some fresh bread with beet butter, which was interesting, very sweet, but the bread was quite tasty and freshly made. They did make a point of coming back a second time to offer us another roll so I tried the white and the whole wheat  and the whole wheat was excellent.  My calamari arrived and I was stunned at the portion size. HUGE! The entire calamari, nicely ringed and still connected at the bottom. Served with a light sauce, capers, heirloom tomatoes and olives, probably one of the best dishes of the evening. I've never had calamari that tender and perfectly cooked. Couldn't have asked for anything better. Note that this was the largest appetizer at the table and it did fill me up quite a bit.  My steak arrived and looked excellent. Sitting on a bed of cabbage with sauce, next fingering potatoes and then the steak, sliced once vertically perched on top of that, it was a beautiful plate. My only issue was that it got really salty as I ate it but altogether, still a wonderfully tasty dish. I had a hard time finishing it because my portion was again, very large.  A bit of a bump here; I was ready to order dessert and the rest of my family wanted wine and a cheese selection. They went back and forth regarding the types of cheeses (this is after a waiter had dropped off the menus) and after much deliberation decided on three cheeses. Only to find out that they only had about 5 or 6 cheeses actually available, only one of them the one that my family wanted. Our waitress kept having to check on what they had - they really shouldn't list the full cheese menu if they don't carry it at all times. This was also true of the menu online; the online menu had a number of items listed that I was interested in trying and none of them were on the menu. Disappointing!  My dessert arrived and looked fantastic but wasn't quite what I was expecting. I felt that the banana and white chocolate and coconut just didn't mesh well into a cohesive dessert. It was tasty but not the best dessert I've had; I'd recommend trying something else. However, i did order a pot of the masala chai tea and it was delicious, a perfect ending to the meal with my dessert.  Our server was clearly skittish, either she was new or she was just a bad waitress because she didn't seem to know the menu very well and kept having to \"check\" on things. She did an okay job but really shouldn't have been serving if she wasn't up to speed on the menu and what menu items are in stock.  Overall, great food at a good restaurant. The service in general could be a lot friendlier from the regular staff. If our server had been a bit warmer and a bit nicer, it would have really made the experience much better. The food here is excellent, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The food is good but expensive. The service is pretty decent, but depending on who's working, can be somewhat pretentious, especially the wine guy. The first time I went their wine was delicious, then the second time I tried to get the same wine but couldn't. We ended up settling for a bottle that wasn't as good as the first time we went. He kept bringing new ones out, which shows great customer service, but they'd keep dropping in quality, as if we don't like nice wine. The chocolate dessert is absolutely delicious. I'd say this place is a solid 4 stars. It's not the best value, but the food is really good (what I had anyhow). I like when restaurants serve game meat. Bison, pretty good red wine, nice rich chocolate dessert and a pretty good selection of high quality loose leaf teas makes this a great place to go if price isn't an option."}
{"text":"Server and food are amazing. Our server was very courteous and knowledgable - knows his wine selection and ready to make recommendations. This is a place to bring a date if you want to make a good impression or take your clients out. Be prepared to spend, however.   i tried the duck breast and it came well prepared. Presentation was also appetizing. Yum. They score points just for presentation alone.   I remember the place being too quiet though which can be awkward. I did not know the person i was with that well (whom I hope is not reading this) so there were lots of awkward moments and silences. The lack of funny characters you'll find in some restaurants leaves you nothing to talk about.  I do not drink so the \"fine wine\" selection was unappealing.   I will come back for business reasons but this will not be my first choice if I am looking for a good restaurant in downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"The oysters, pasta of the evening, duck, and buttermilk panna cota were all fine though nothing special.  The Niagara stone fruit was excellent.  The restaurant is attractive and the staff is pleasant.   The service was way too slow, there was about a 30 minute wait from ordering to receiving our oysters -- how long does it take to open some oysters.  There were similar delays between our other courses.  When we wanted our water glasses refilled we had to flag our waiter.          At the time we ate the restaurant was only about a quarter filled."}
{"text":"I really liked/loved the food, which is creative, very tasty, served in good proportion. Perfect combinations of tastes, textures. Everything was perfectly cooked and presented. Really great! Was a fabulous dinner.  Not good (at all) for such a good meal in a relatively classy place (impressed by the high ceiling design but not by washrooms) was the service. Why the heck is the waiter trying to make cynical jokes, wearing an ugly blue open-collared shirt and paying so little attention to customers? I want my waiter (for the price of the dinner; around CAD 170 for 2) to be served by a tied, nice and courteous (at least trying to be or faking) guy/staff (sommelier was ok, nicer and polite). Being taken care of should be part of the experience and they should fix that. That really spoiled the experience and only because of this can I not conclude that I want to go back right away (otherwise for the food I would!)."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with some colleauges.  We made reservations and were seated immediately.  We all had the prix-fix Winterlicious deal, which was about $25.  I ordered the duck, and it was great - they get 1 point for food quality!    The service was also decent, it was quick, and they were friendly, and they didn't screw up our orders, what more can you ask for?  Overall, there are better places in Toronto to eat at, and that's what prevents this place from getting a 5/5 rating.  There is no real WOW factor here.  But you will have an enjoyable evening here."}
{"text":"I came here with some friends and had a great experience. The service was great, we were seated promptly and the waiter was super friendly and knowledgeable. The restaurant was really elegant and understated which I liked.   I had the steak which was cooked perfectly. It was absolutely delicious and I am really picky about steak! Everyone in our party was pleased with their food which is rare and definitely a good sign. The only thing that came up was we thought the portions were too small and I would agree that it was smaller than most other comparable restaurants.   For dessert I had the lemon tart which was so good I didn't want to share (I did of course but it was THAT good :)).   This is a great restaurant for a nice lunch with friends, I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This review is based on my lunch experience ($20) at Pangaea during Summerlicious 2012.  Hungry.. Hungry.. my lunch date kept telling me she is hungry.  Portion definitely is small.. Please stop looking at me with hungry eyes...  We ordered:  Appetizers: Shrimp Salad Jamón Ibérico \"Bellota\" Salad  Main: Beef Tenderloin Speckled Trout  Dessert: Buttermilk Panna Cotta Flourless Chocolate Torte  All the food here is nicely prepared, plated and delicious. Mini sized aside from the dessert. Pangaea must believe that dessert is the most important part of the meal?!  When we were leaving Pangaea, my friend asked \"What's for lunch!\" I guess she still hungry..."}
{"text":"Food was good but weird....they took my credit card to charge it instead bringing the mobile reader, that they used at the adjacent table, they took my cc and charged it then brought it back.. I didn't like that at all.  Service was okay but had to constantly ask for water service which was a but tedious .  MIght give it another try"}
{"text":"Great service and nice atmosphere. Portions are rather small thus the pricing is high for what you get (downside) but on the upside I was happy to have a lunch and leave satisfied but not regretting being overstuffed.  Having the fish and chips I wondered a little bit how this dish fit into the somewhat fancier menu items around it. Well, the presentation does fit in and I think my only complaint is the fish pieces are small enough where there might be too much breading around them for perfection of taste rather than presentation."}
{"text":"Underwhelmed  Went for winterlicious, had higher expectations of the service & food. Especially for Yorkville area. the best item on my prix fixed dinner was the appi, which was the beef carpaccio; my lamb entre was 75% lamb fat then meat. The dessert was more biscotti then creme Brûlé. Which was disappointing. I had been very specific in my reservation in stating that one of the ppl attending had a very very high sensitivity to nuts, and when i told them who had the allergy it seems to be forgotten as she got served nuts on her dessert on the top. EpiPen should be brought as they are not sensitive to allergies"}
{"text":"I must have eaten here 15 times 10 years ago but on a recent visit to Toronto I visited this restaurant twice. Both times the experience was a disappointment.  On one visit I had the white truffle risotto - price listed on the menu as \"market\" - the appetizer turned out to be $45 for the small dish. The risotto was delicious as it should be for $45 but any restaurant that serves a $45 appetizer should have the means to print daily menus with prices if indeed \"market\" value on a truffle is unpredictable. Or the server should indicate that information. The halibut dish was very bland with awkwardly shaped and cooked garnish. The beets and potatoes were mushy and the skins were falling off the clumsily sliced potatoes in the pool of flavorless broth like small band-aids in water. A really poorly conceived dish, and for $38 the worst restaurant value in my recent memory. The calamari appetizer had a weird consistency and tasted only like char from the grill but was very mushy overall with the garnish. Same for the lobster gnocchi - half a lobster seemed more like 1/4. Is there something in the Canadian exchange rate that makes the portion so small? Overall the dish tasted nice but it was a mushy appetizer portion. All this leads me to wonder if Pangaea's clientele is mostly old women with bad teeth or no teeth, afraid of large portions that threaten their waistline, yet have endless money. No deal guys."}
