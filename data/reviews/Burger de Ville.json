{"text":"2nd time here, burgers are always tasty and made from fresh beef. That they claim and I believe it is true; You will taste the difference."}
{"text":"I went in at 830 on a Saturday and got a burger to go.  The fries were good but the burger was probably the worst I have ever had.  I could not taste the meat because it was overpowered completely by a black charcoal burnt flavour that was disgusting.  Maybe the grill was dirty after a long day, but it was the worst.   

To be honest, and this may be paranoia.... I noticed the young guys at the grill kept looking over at me while they were making it, and I think they gave me a gross burger just to f@@@ with me.  I say this because, when I took the burger apart to inspect the insides to see why it was so bad,  there was a very small red hot pepper That I Did NOT order, hidden Under the burger.  

Gross burger that I feel they made badly just for me!  Thanks for nothing"}
{"text":"Mmmmm, Burger De Ville, where do I start..... This isn't a joint for those who squirm about a good pound of meat in a single burger. They serve it up with all the trimmings, including a decent sized slice of pickle, and the poutine is delicious, good gravy and a plethora of cheese kurds. If you're looking for a delicious, reasonably priced burger this is the place for you. It lacks the fancier MGR Burger kobe meat but it's also almost as good for less than half the price. This place is aces anywhere, and when it comes to the slim pickings us Montreal West residents have to choose from, it's the best restaurant in the area, hands down"}
{"text":"Delightful eating experience at Burger De Ville this weekend!

This small, charming and mainly English-speaking neighborhood in Montreal Ouest holds the tastiest, juiciest, most well-constructed burger I've had in years, bro. Great way to toast au revoir to the unofficial end of summer. Get the spicy fries! I'm a bitch when it comes to heat, but the fries I handled. No sweat. Also, FREE REFILLS when you purchase a fountain drink.

The set-up is actually pretty efficient in my opinion. You walk in, decide then and there what you'd like to eat, order and pay up front to the cashier - all before putting ass to seat. I only wish I knew about that before I waited 5 minutes to be seated. 

Absolutely no doubt about it, this burger joint is yet another reason for me to return to this beautiful city I've come to crush on.


Go Bruins!

{"text":"OK, the burgers are very good.  Yup, they're yummy alright.  But the place is expensive!  The other reviews have 5-6 bucks listed as a price, but it seems to me that the prices are twice that.  It may be because it's a chain and the one I've gone to is in Montreal West, which is kind of a ritzy neighbourhood.  Anyway, price aside, the reason I just can't dig this place is the service.  I've gone 3 times (didn't want to judge service based on one potentially bad day) and all three times I had to wait between 30 and 40 minutes.  For a burger and fries.  One of those times was during the dinner rush, so, ok ... but the other 2 times, there weren't that many people.  And all 3 times, they messed up my order.  Even the third time, when I explained that the previous 2 times, my order got confused, they managed to make the same mistake.  I had a better experience in the one on St Laurent... but I will not be visiting the one on Westminster again."}
{"text":"I would really like to rate this place 5/5, they make some of the best burgers I've had. However, I've been there twice and the fries were cold both times. 4$ for fries, you expect them to be made fresh. Also, my friend had a poutine and drink for 10$, the fries were cold. The poutine gravy is hand made so its good, but not with cold fries."}
{"text":"The only discrepancy I had with the burger was with the \"lettuce\" - they use mesclun - little dainty baby salad leaves nestled atop a big fat burger is totally wrong. Albeit, it's not a big deal, when you're grunting and eating meat cooked over fire, the only kind of vegetables that should be involved is scenario is ketchup and bacon. Burger deVille is a palce for solid burgers, the kind your fat uncle makes for the family barbeque in the summer. Nothing fancy, you go here cos you want a burger, a good burger, a good burger made the way you like it."}
{"text":"Probably the best place to eat in St. Leonard. 

As my friends and I entered through the doors, we were greeted by the cashier and he gave us a run down of the menu and specials. 

A couple of my friends have been there before and told me the steak was unreal. I had a tough time choosing between the burger and the steak, so I ordered both. YOLO.

The burger was 6 bucks, and dressed any way you like it, cooked to the way you want it too.
It was fantastic, think of a Five Guys burger, but better and more value. 

The steak was 14oz, asked for medium rare but it came out as rare, didn't bother me since I can handle it. Marbling on the steak was crazy, so much flavour! Steak comes with a side of your choice.

All in all my meal came out to 30 dollars, it was so good I left nothing on the plate. 
I'd definitely come back and recommend this place to anyone who likes burgers and/or steak.

FYI: Free refills on the soft drinks."}
{"text":"I absolutely love burger de ville. When I'm craving a good burger this is the place to be. You have a huge selection of toppings to put on your burger so the sky is the limit. My faves are the caramelized onions, harissa mayo and jalapeños. They also have an amazing poutine sauce which is made from scratch using real veal meat. Its affordable good food and the service is always friendly. Highly recommend"}

LA poutine par contre était délicieuse

Si je suis dans les environ possiblement que je tenterai ma chance une autre fois  mais pour le moment ca ne vaut pas le détour"}
{"text":"Excellent burger. La qualité de la viande est superbe et les ingrédients bien travaillés. je recommande le bleu avec ses oignons caramelisés!!"}
{"text":"This place has really gone down over the years. This is the last time I'm going back over there. Asked for a medium burger and it came out raw. I asked them to redo it and they just retired the same burger which was burnt when he gave it back, which the cook didn't seem to agree as he was condescending and arrogant about it. He made another burger and said if this isn't good than I can't help you. That burger was raw as well. The cook over there doesn't know how to cook if he can look at a raw burger and tell me that it's medium. The meat was so raw that the inside was cold, wet and bleeding all over the plate. Extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"I loved this place when it first opened but nowadays, they seem incapable of getting a take out order right. The last 4-5 times we've ordered, they've messed up the toppings on the burgers and put in the wrong fries. It's probably not a coincidence that there seems to be a new employee taking the orders every time we've gone. Anyway, they need to get their act together because opening the bag at home and finding every burger sporting the wrong toppings because of careless service has become really frustrating (to the point where we've decided to take a pass on BdV for the rest of 2012). How hard is it to get 2 toppings right?!?"}
{"text":"Best burger ever. I always take the same thing! Goat cheese carm onions mushrooms and pickles! Craxy mix but so delishhhh its my sunday night treat with my boyfreind!  I tried recently the Cesar salad and its so saucy and good! The deville salad is also one of a kind , I like to take my meal to go obly because of how the burger is perfectly perfect wrapped up! Its a cool place its almost like an open kitchen concept only its the grill wich is great! Smells like bbq as soon as you walk in , deff a must try on your list!"}
{"text":"Seriously the best burger in Montreal. The service is fast and the staff is friendly. The high quality  beef is freshly ground daily and cooked to your specifications. Everytime I eat a burger here I'm always blown away by how great it is. I had the cheese and bacon burger with caramelized onions with spicy mayo and jalapeño peppers (cooked medium) and a small poutine with a sprite for $17.50. Plenty of food to appease my huge appetite at an unbeatable price for the quality. Highly recommend the Burger de Ville on 7093 Jarry east street. Wherever you live, it's worth the detour. Stop reading and head over there now."}
{"text":"Bored on a weekend we decided finding it as a top burger spot in Montreal. It was absolutely amazing. Best burger I've had in years. 

I had a cheeseburger and a poutine. Their fries and gravy sauce was top notch.

We walked in not knowing if we have to sit or order upfront. It was a bit slow too. Can't blame them though, it was a Friday. Besides that the service was excellent.

Will be going again as soon as I can."}
{"text":"I had salad De Ville. Yes I ordered a salad at a burger joint. But it was delicious! Topped with loads of goat cheese, pecans, and cramberries. Homemade dressing was yummy. Very well priced.
Great service!"}
{"text":"Look, I'll be honest: I'm a vegetarian. Am I a heretic for reviewing a burger joint? Maybe. What I'm really here for is to point vegetarians toward Burger De Ville's portobello mushroom burger. And by that, I mean you can order any burger on the menu, and replace it with a big hunk of meaty non-meat. I ordered the Noir & Bleu, which featured a slab of grilled blue cheese smouldering over a savoury mushroom. That's the thing with being a vegetarian, we don't necessarily all want to be eating chick peas at every hour of the day. Sometimes I want a juicy, dirty good burger! And I want fries with that too! Luckily, Burger de Ville have some solid taters."}
{"text":"Staff was super friendly, and burger was decent (although a bit dry). Friend's poutine was also a bit disappointing. Would scratch the burger itch, but not a place I would crave or plan to go to. Friend felt that the other location (in the plateau) was better taste-wise."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for several years, and the food is always consistently great.  The burgers are fantastic, with tons of options.  They are a bit messy to eat, with all the toppings I put on, but delicious.  The poutine is pretty good, too.  And the price cannot be beat."}
{"text":"Super hamburger mais le service est à la peine."}
{"text":"Je les préfèrent à ceux de Five Guys! Ambiance pas top. Le personnel est gentil. Je vous suggère le Saint Burger. La Poutine est bonne mais manque de fromage. Enfants friendly. Attention, cuisson inconstante, n'hésitez pas a redemander si trop cuit."}
{"text":"Real and juicy patties, cooked just right.
I had the Saint-Paulin burger : a bit on the stale side though.
In my opinion, this place lacks that little something special compared to Mr. Steer's burgers."}
{"text":"« Rappel : Consommer de la volaille ou de la viande crue ou pas assez cuite peut augmenter le risque de maladies d'origine alimentaire. » C'est la notice qui apparaît tout au bas de l'immense tableau-menu du restaurant. Vous aurez été prévenus! Au moins l'on s'assume! Burger de Ville se targue de ne vendre que du buf 100% canadien, frais et jamais congelé. Les frites quant à elle sont cuites dans l'huile d'arachide et contiennent 0% de cholestérol. Un restaurant santé? Je ne suis pas prêt à affirmer cela. Un restaurant certes, où vous mangerez un burger de qualité, mais ne faites par la gaffe de le prendre tout garni, car vous vous retrouverez avec une sorte de grosse boule noyée dans son jus multicolore. C'est que la liste des condiments est assez exhaustive, allant de la relish à la sauce HP, passant par les oignons caramélisés, la moutarde dijon, l'harissa, et les cornichons. Cette liste ne vous coûtera rien en extra, et je plains le téméraire qui ose inclure les 17 condiments gratuits...  Cependant, et cela va de soi, vous devrez cracher quelques dollars en surplus si vous désirez un burger un peu plus raffiné : fromage de chèvre, Saint-Paulin, bleu, légumes grillés...

Le restaurant est hyper populaire. Des clients entrent à chaque instant et se dirigent vers l'un des deux comptoirs respectifs : manger ici / emporter. Peu importe votre choix, l'on vous donnera un petit numéro en plastique et vous invitera à vous attabler. L'on peut se servir de l'eau fraîche au pichet. Le temps venu, quelqu'un vous livrera la marchandise dans une assiette ou dans un sac. Burgers, poutines, salades repas, steaks, frites épicées...

J'ai impunément englouti mon cheeseburger. Il faut avouer qu'il se mangeait tout seul. La boulette était partiellement cuite, ce dont je ne suis pas habitué. Précisez si vous le voulez bien cuit; autrement, il sera servi selon le credo... N'empêche que la boulette était très tendre, rosée et juteuse... C'était de bon goût!.."}

{"text":"This is one of the most unique fast casual fast food burger joints I have ever walked into, in the trendy Saint-Laurent Boulevard corridor.  A league apart from the five guys and other chain burger upstarts.

You walk into a fast casual bistro, pick your fresh burger or steak from the refrigerated front counter display and they flame broil it right there on the spot.  The choice of burger, steak, salad, chicken etc are excellent and so is the modest wine selection.  I was shocked to see a full wine cellar on the way to the basement.

You pick your toppings and everything is made to order.  Ordered hamburger and side salad with flame broiled chicken and a diet coke;  the portions are a HUGE, hit the spot and very very very very yummy; will definitely come back! #YULBURGERADVENTURES"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday evening, we were expecting table service, but instead you go to the counter, order, pay and they give you a number and deliver to your table. While they display meat in a counter, they never ask you how you want your burger done, which suggests that they are using pre-ground meat, and can therefore only serve it well done... or as I call it, over done. The burger was too thick for my liking, personally. The poutine was nice, but definitely not a generous portion, even considering that we ordered the large.

I understand the understated delivery system during the daytime, but maybe one side of the dining room should offer table service in the evening?"}
{"text":"I'd heard good things from my bro-in-law and a co-worker; so on Saturday I went for a late lunch there.

I had the Hamburger Steak with fries, grilled veggies and sauce. Good size portions; and the taste more importantly was good too. I'm not a sauce fan but ate 2/3 of the cup served with the steak. The fries were nice dry and crispy, well-drained. The small poutine was not really small. I'm sure the large poutine is all one could eat as a meal.

My steak actually arrived cooked medium, most places I order medium rare and end up with medium well or well done.

Not being in the downtown core, the space was a treat.

The concept of ordering at the counter then sitting at the table to await your meal makes this place half way between a fast food and table service restaurant. No problem for me.

Great value, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Pros and cons of the place
I think they may a really good burger and fries. And honestly the service is perfect when served by (what I think is) the owner. 
Unfortunately if you stray away from the burger and fries it's not the best. I tried their chili and really not in the top 10. 
Decor is drab but place is spotless."}
{"text":"Best burger in Montreal IMHO. Fries also excellent AND if your not feeling up for a burger you can have a reasonably priced steak..."}
{"text":"Fast good + faux-filet.semblent utiliser de la vraie viande.personnel aimable,bière et vin.frites insignifiantes.utile,mais sans charme particulier.le local a déjà héberge le citrus"}
{"text":"i'll be honest: i'm a carnivore. they grind fresh beef and hand-form the patties here and burgers are 4.50. this is why i frequent burger de ville. the quality to price ratio is very high - one of the truly cheap and good restos in the city. go all out: bacon cheese burger. you ask for it cooked medium - it comes served medium. much better than other 'gourmet' burger places who charge more."}
{"text":"Solid burgers and even better ribs! 

The price point is also VERY friendly and there's a huge area where you can sit down and enjoy your food. I'm really glad we stopped by this place when we were on Mile End! 

Worth checking this place out :)"}
{"text":"Burgers, chicken caesar and steaks very good for the price. Extremely generous discount for police/EMS/military in uniform. Unlimited tap soda refills. Burgers are definitely the best for the price in the city. Avoid peek meal times as lines get big and very very long (only real big downside)."}
{"text":"Got a quality, good quantity, good consistency, and great burgers! We don't eat there, as it can be a zoo, but other than that, nothing but good things to say about this little gem."}
{"text":"These guys are burger architects. Their compilations are the perfect balance of meatiness and juiciness, especially the black and blue burger that they will with all confidence cook to your preference.  You want the patty done rare? Done! You want it cooked well done? They'll do that too, but the kitchen buzz will suffer from the insult. But I digress... 

The black & blue burger consists of this aforementioned deliciously cooked all-beef, never frozen, All-Canadian patty nestled on a layer of caramelized onions and crowned with a halo of crushed blacked pepper and a slab of blue cheese.  Sliced tomatoes and some greens complete the masterpiece. 

You want more toppings than that? No worries, they've got a tonne of toppings- all free. And, speaking of free... they refill your fountain sodas for free.

All this and a great \"small town\" vibe makes Burger de Ville a five-star burger joint."}
{"text":"At the Original Montreal West - Westminster N. Ave. location.
Imagine this: A thick fresh hunk of lean Canadian ground beef, crusted with crushed black peppercorns cooked to perfection (for me this is Medium Rare but you can have it your way, too) and topped with a generous slab of blue cheese along with all the fixings. Everything is home-style fresh, from the tomatoes to the caramelized onions made, I think, onsite All this is assembled into a picture perfect burger, with fresh black poppy-seed buns to contain it all.  Sink your teeth into the jaw popping sandwich and happiness wash over you wave after delicious wave.
Then, have a peanut oil deep-fried french fry and flutter into the bliss of blisses.

Fountain soda refills are free, service is small-town friendly. Absolutely wonderful place to grab a hearty and nostalgic burger!"}
{"text":"Absolutely one of the best burgers I have ever had! The food is fresh and delicious . Tried the spicy fries, and enjoyed some chilli as well...the service was exceptional! I highly recommend Burger de Ville on Jarry street in Montreal !"}
{"text":"I just got a super tasty meal from Burger de Ville! Cheeseburger with caesar sald to go. The burger was 9/10, very good stuff. The toppings are amazing (excellent pickles). The side caesar was tasty too! All around, my stomach is very very happy."}
{"text":"Went in at the hart of lunch time.
Thought it would be busy. 
There  was only  6 people in the place . 
I ordered a simple burger .
It was good but nothing extraordinary .
Sitting waiting 15 min for my burger to be brought to table gave me time to  notice the holes in the floor  that could be easily be  covered with a little cement..  led me to beleive there's no attention to detail 
but tables were clean and  staff was friendly with typical classic rock music playing at reasonable level.  
all n all  it's  OK but wouldn't go out of my way for it."}

I've had to wait 40 mins to be served- not good with young kids. However, you won't be disappointed with the food- the burgers, the salads, kid portions too (at a fair price).  The decor needs a little help from a friendly designer- and the bathroom should get cleaned up-"}
{"text":"Really good burgers with all the toppings you want for only like $7. And they're pretty big too.

My only issue is that their fries are great too but they don't do like a side of fries. Their fry orders are huge. 

Their poutine is also good both regular and tex mex. I often get that alone as a meal. The tex mex isn't too spicy either. I've heard mixed things about their ribs. I also have not tried their steaks but they look good and a decent size. 

Great milkshakes too and their drink selection has some variety. Beer too. 

During lunch hours it's sometimes a super long line upwards of 30 minutes. Kind of annoying when trying to get back to the office quick so you need to be there before 11:30"}
{"text":"Awesome taste with perfect service..... goût impressionnant avec un service parfait :)"}
{"text":"The owners of this franchise genuinely care about delivering a good product.

This is quite simply one of the best hamburgers you can get in Montreal. While unlimited toppings are included in every burger, the meat is always the star of the show. This is so important and often lacking in so many designer burger joints.The patty is thick and has that genuine grilled on the bbq taste. What's more, they will cook a burger medium or medium rare if you request it. I cannot understand people who eat meat cooked above a medium. You might as well just become vegetarian if chewing on a piece of charcoal is your idea of a good time.

Fries and poutines are also excellent. My wife and I have been going here for years. We always get small Ceasar salads to start. Finally, the price point is extremely reasonable for this level of consistency. Please trust me. The world needs more Burger de Villes."}
{"text":"This place was clean, spacious, and cheap. Burgers were yummy and came with a variety of unique complimentary toppings that you can select. The fries were great, especially dipped in spicy mayo. They even had great deals on ribs when I came. Overall a great alternative to Mcdonalds."}
{"text":"Get the tapenade burger while it lasts. Add some caramelized onions to perfectly balance the thick slice of creamy goat cheese. The black olive tapenade is a little too salty and overpowers the rest of the burger so I would put half of it aside on the plate. In terms of texture and taste, this is by far the most satisfying burger under $12 in Montreal. If you're taking fries, I suggest taking spicy fries with no salt (the cajun spice is already quite salty).

I order my burgers medium nowadays at BDV. Medium-rare tends to be too rare and lacks texture. It's less char than I remember way back then but still excellent value.

Topping pairing matters. Don't blame poor combination on the house."}
{"text":"Very good inexpensive burger that is guaranteed to fill you up. Free unlimited toppings and there's a lot to chose from. 
Try their soups they are delicious and a good way to jeep you warm in the winter. There is a black waiter there he gives very good service always making sure you are satisfied and din't need anything. The cooks are really good also. Only negative point about this place is the girls who work there they got a lot of attitude for nothing not the friendliest waitresses out there.  Still worth going though especially if you haven't tried it before!"}
{"text":"Really good and fresh burger with McDonald prices. I have brought so many friends to this place, they are all like it."}
{"text":"Was passing through the neighborhood and decided to drop in.

From the cozy decor that contrasts somewhat with the open wall kitchen

I ordered the Suisse Pleurote Burger with a big fried oyster mushroom, swiss cheese, dijonnaise and a home-made beef patty fried the way you like it (I opted for medium). Talk about having it your way (Sorry Burger King), for only $9.00. The burger is served open so you can add extra toppings before you close it. It's so tall, I had a little trouble pressing down to bite into it but no trouble savoring it.

For an extra $2.00 you get a generous portion of fries, which I tried with their peppercorn mayonnaise.

Definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"A burger is supposed to be just a burger. But until you've had one from burger de ville you don't realize really how wrong that affirmation is. What can start as a simple burger can quickly become a tower of goodness. Having the possibilities to chose so many free toppings is incredible.  Of course there's your usual toppings... lettuce, tomato, pickle, relish and ketchup. But then you fall in the less traditional toppings (and these are still free): caramelized onions and champignons sautés. The biggest challenge with the burger is how to open your mouth big enough to take a bite of what is now a mountain of a burger.

And the taste of the burger becomes something incredible. The nice part is that you can go there often and always have a different burger...just mix the topping around. 

After having been there once you'll probably be like me and start to make a list of things to try in the future: burger st-paulin, burger bleu et noir, poutine de ville (goat cheese!)"}
{"text":"An overall good experience.  It was not too crowded at the time my husband and I went. I ordered the steak with a side salad, and my husband ordered a bacon cheeseburger with a side of fries.  Because we are on holiday, we also ordered the baby back rib combo just to taste it.  My husband and thoroughly enjoyed his burger.  The steak was OK.  It was a little to charred for medium well which took away some of the flavor of the meat. But, we would still visit again."}
{"text":"I've heard great stuff about this place for over a year, so it was on my \"have to try\" list.

I went with a friend today for lunch - extremely slow service for what is basically a hockey rink cantine that just serves burgers with seating for about 25 people or so.

I ordered my burger medium, got well done.     It took so long to get it, I wasn't going to ask for another one.
My $8.50 Black & Blue burger (fries are an extra $3) was a small, dry little hockey puck on a gigantic bun that was full of sauce and therefore extremely messy to eat.    You only get one napkin, so you'd better bring your own from home - there are no actual waiters or waitresses milling around to ask.    The piece of blue cheese on the burger was good, however.

My friend had the same experience with her burger - dry little hockey puck.   She said the best part was the piece of feta cheese on hers.   

As most of the reviews are very positive about this place, I'm going to guess that I was there on an off day."}
{"text":"Five Guys Burgers & Fries, I've met your match!  In fact, in my opinion this burger joint is better! The grilled veggies, spicy fries & burgers were amazing. 

I had a basic Bacon Cheese Burger but loaded it with lettuce, tomato, black pepper mayo, onions, sautéed mushrooms and jalapeño sauce... 

My friend had the Black & Blue Burger and added sautéed mushrooms. We both agreed that the patties must have been freshly prepared and grilled perfectly to maintain its juiciness. The toppings were  extremely fresh also. 

When you order a burger, for $2 more you get an individual fries. We (2 of us) decided to each order a burger and pay $3 for a dish of spicy fries suitable for two people. We also shared a plate of grilled veggies which included a red pepper, yellow pepper, onion, eggplant and a zucchini pieces. 

By the time we were finished eating, she was \"so full\" and I felt it was a perfect amount of food for the two of us. As for the staff, I found all three of the counter front ladies were friendly & helpful. Considering how hungry we were & our eagerness to eat, the preparation time was quick. Faster than we were expecting. 

Great work Burger de Ville. I know why you guys are award winning!"}

{"text":"One of my favorite spots along with the other location on Westminster. 10.25 for a burger with a milkshake..the burger itself is 4.50 to 5.50 if you wanna add cheese and bacon. Fries are also good and a full meal for a person costs around 9-14 dollars depending if you wanna have a regular drink, milkshake or fries. Also the burgers have unlimited toppings, of which there is 19 to choose from. 

I also tried the steak for 15 dollars and it was great, it comes with a side. I chose a caesar salad that usually costs 5 dollars so if you think about it the steak itself is around 10 dollars and for that price it can't be beat.

The service is good."}

The prices are horrible, I had to send my burger back 2 times... it was practically  mooing at me it was so undercooked,  it was dangerous. I'm not joking.

Service was horrendous because the owner (I think) was very rude to my friends and I. We wanted separate bills, and yes there was 9 of us but so what? The \"owner\" then in an exasperated voice, complained that it's slow to do it individually. He changed his mind and agreed saying it was going to be slower that way. He was also rushing us when we ordered and seemed to be stressed....this guy had no control over his emotions whatsoever. Always complaining to the customers...

My burger was huge, which is fine, but it tasted nothing special. I think I prefer burgers at Mcdonald's to be honest.

Atmosphere was supposed to be a \"classier\" feel to it...more upscale than a typical burger place. But it was just weird for me...probably because the service totally warped my perception on the ambiance.

Never. Again."}
{"text":"Il y a quelques temps j'ai essayé cet endroit grâce à Yelp Ohh mon dieu c divinement bon leur burger champignons et ognons . Les prix sont raisonnables. La serveuse est super sympathique c'était une bonne expérience à refaire c sûre"}
{"text":"Passed by this place so often that I was bound to stop and go in some day and this day has come.
There is the smell of welcoming grease as you come in, telling you \"come and eat fattening food, you will only regret it later\". As always, I listened to the voices and made my way to the counter. We tried the tombé d'in pommes burger (with apple fritters), it was quite good and surprising, but then I love any sugary-salty mix. The meat is very good and fresh. The burgers are a bit small for my taste (hey, if I'm eating fattening food, I might as well get a huge dose of it!) and the fried were a bit soggy but it was good nonetheless.
The place could definitely use a decor freshening though!"}
{"text":"I happened to be in that area and i just walked in, after briefly reading a few reviews on yelp. I had a portobello burger (vegetarian) and it was pretty good! Their beef is also 100% Canadian (if you care...you should!). They also have a huge list of toppings, including caramelized onions and a sauce called harissa harissa and mayo harissa; it's a slightly spicy sauce, a little sweet too. The staff is extremely nice, very welcoming and super patient. There were a few pieces of dirt (i think) in my ice tea though, probably directly from the machine, but it was no biggie..hence the 4* rating. Would definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"Swiss Oyster Mushroom Burger and The Black and Blue are great. No need to add ketchup or mustard.

The medium cook beef allows you to really  enjoy all the flavor of theses juicy creation.

Basic decor but trust me you won't mind. On the flip side this is not the place to eat a poutine.

Overall I give it a 4."}
{"text":"Having visited there on numerous occasions,  my expectations were already high. Burger Deville did not disappoint. Ordinarily,  I would go ahead with a customized burger but this time I opted for the Cantina Burger. For $11, you recieve the highest quality ground beef with smoked mozzarella,  pancetta,  bruscetta,  pesto!, a pepper mayo dressing - along with your choice of spicy or regular fries (I opted for the regular). Simply amazing. I had it cooked medium and the burger was done to perfection. After enjoying my meal,  I chatted with the owner and it was very evident how passionate he is about his food.... And it is evident in the product. Highly recommended

Next time,  I will surely try the steak as I am told by friends that it is amazing - and it is only $18!!!"}
{"text":"Bad experience here tonight. Three of us ordered burgers all cooked the same - medium. Mine came late and after I got one bite in, I saw burger was raw on inside. I sent it back. Rather than cook a new one they put the raw one back on grill, seared the edges and brought it back. They literally threw it on the table and quickly left table. After a bite, I saw it was still raw at center. I couldn't get anyone's attention and my guests were almost finished. Staff avoided checking with me again. Bad"}
{"text":"Burgers. 
Am I right? 

Haha this is a place where I will always remember the first time being there. Being 19 and wondering what it was and then being completely mind blown on how good it was.
Custom made burgers are i find the best ever. You choose what you want and know one can judge you. I love the bacon burger with jalipinos.. it's a way of spoiling myself after doing something good. Haha

But I highly recommend you coming here. Even if it's for a hangout or showing someone the town... This place won't let you down.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"On a business trip, went here because of the yelp reviews. Order at the counter and a waitress brings your food. There were only 3 tables occupied including mine. Food took awhile and I got serviced after a 3 person table that came after I did. Anywho, the burger was ok. I've had much better (Fukuburger in las Vegas for one). I ordered the regular burger with cheese and spicy fries. I didn't get the spice on my fries. I told the server, and she brought out a cup of seasoning and sprinkled some on. That kindof took the magic out of it. Just ok burger."}
{"text":"They have plenty free toppings including caramelized onion. I often go there to grab a quick lunch. The burger is fresh. However,their dining room might not be the cleanest. Last time when I went, they had some problems with the air conditioning machine,and staff did not mention so water drops on my head. Apart of that, their foods are worth the price."}
{"text":"On yet another visit to Montreal I heard this place served one of the better burgers in the city.  I had to try it. They claim that the burgers are 100% Canadian beef, fresh never frozen. The price is $5-6 per burger with unlimited free toppings. By far one of the cheapest things I've seen in this expensive city! The poutine \"de Ville\" is a must try as well, it's regular poutine with a black peppercorn sause that gives it a little kick. VERY good. A large portion which most people couldn't down themselves is only $7.50. A quiet place on the off hours, it was worth the 15 minute drive from our downtown hotel."}
{"text":"\"Best Burger in Town\" is not an exaggeration. It's the best. The salad and chilli are also great!"}
{"text":"Great burgers! There's no other way to say it. They make hamburgers, and they make them well. 

Fun experience!"}
{"text":"Burger de Ville has a number of locations in Montreal. It came highly recommended by friends as a great restaurant for burgers. I visited the establishment at 59 Westminster North in Montreal West on a Saturday evening with a party of five others. While there was no wait for us, the restaurant was full and there seemed to be a lengthy wait for people who entered after our group. We all ordered at the cash, paid our bills and were then seated at a table. It would appear that this is the process for all diners at this establishment.

I ordered a regular hamburger, well done, garnished with mustard, red onions, tomatoes and hot pimento peppers. They offer all kinds of garnishing's for your burgers that are clearly posted on the wall as you pay. The hamburger beef at Burger de Ville is 100 % Alberta beef a good selling point in my books. They state the beef is fresh and never frozen. I also had an order of French Fries and a Coke. All soft drinks from the fountain were refillable at no extra charge (another good selling point). I found the burger to be good but on the dry side. Perhaps this was because I ordered it well done. The fries were golden brown and very good. The price for this meal including tip was approximately $15. I enjoyed the meal and the burger was a cut above most burgers I have eaten in Montreal.

I would have given a higher rating to Burger de Ville but there were a couple of things I disliked about this particular location. First, the bathroom was dirty. As I wash prior to eating all my meals, I found this may have affected my dining experience. Secondly, I found the staff particularly the cashier to be a tad rude. I was left with the impression that when I asked about certain menu options I should have known the answer to these questions. Finally, I found this particular location to be very small and cramped, space wise."}
{"text":"Great burgers, great selection of toppings, great selection of sides. Everything is fresh and prepared on the spot: yes, this does increase the wait time and isn't what people expect when they think \"fast food,\" but this is a gourmet burger prepared like you would at home.  Better than you would at home, they grind the delicious looking chunk of beef right there in front of you!

The spicy fries (with the spicy mayo) are a great side if you like food with a bit of kick."}
{"text":"C'est ma deuxième visite il faut en entrant payer à la caisse et commander ensuite on nous donne un numéro et on se prends  une table la déco est très ordinaire mais on y va pour les Burgers"}
{"text":"Could be great but they don't even ask for a cooking point! Instead they serve you actually great meat as a piece of charcoal in such a speed that you can only be sure that it has been cooked already before you  have arrived... Shame, cause as I said nothing can be said against the quality of the meat and they have a creative variety of tasty flavors to go with the burgers which is as true for their toppings as for their sides!"}
{"text":"I understand the haters' objections (overpriced, inconsistent service), but I've always gotten a kick out of this place. Great food, and going during the lunchtime rush is kind of fun rather than an ordeal; it's got a nice, almost neighborhood-institution feel, and it seems like there are a lot of regulars."}
{"text":"Best burger I had in life, end of the story

I had the blue cheese burger and it tasted so good. The spicy french fries are also delicious.

You must try this restaurant if you like burgers"}
{"text":"I had been looking forward to eating here for a long time as I  love hamburgers.

I started with an onion soup that tasted like very salty dishwater, followed by an overcooked, dry hamburger patty garnished with a miniscule amount of lettuce and off tasting pickle.

However, at least it was cheap.

Overall, I have been happier with a Wendy's Big Bacon Classic, which are more tasty."}
{"text":"Great location.  Quick service and MASSIVE burger.  We ate 2 burgers and shared a poutine, had 2 drinks all for $22.
I like the ability to custom design the burger.
It was busy but we still had space.
Not my first time here, but this was my best experience so far."}
{"text":"Outstanding burgers, including a pepper-crusted blue-cheese burger that is sinfully good. And for non-carnivores,  good soups and tasty, generous-sized salads. It's easy to eat for $10 or less. Service is generally friendly and helpful. Decor is plain, but the atmosphere is pleasant."}
{"text":"I have been to this place 3 times. The first time the burger was under cooked. I figured that since it was the first week they were open, I would give them another chance. The second visit it was great. The third visit the burger was not just under cooked, it was nearly raw. I mean RAW! I sent it back and they just threw it back on the grill until the outside was like a rock and the inside was ok, and the bun was soggy. 

I am not going back."}
{"text":"Tried it because of the reviews & was not disappointed. You get to choose how you want it cooked and all of your toppings to. It's the real McCoy when it comes to the meat. Well seasoned and thick. The Demi glacé sauce for the poutine is also very tasty! A definite must try if you like burgers. Also the service was great."}
{"text":"The place was middle-of-the-pack. We got 2 burgers and a side of fries to split. You order at the counter but someone brings it over to you, honestly the bus boy was far more amicable that the cashier. The burgers were a little over priced at $10 with no sides when the patties themselves were much more \"tall\" than \"round\" if you know what I mean. The value was there in the toppings but the place didn't live up to the hype. If they were to try and update their service more and focus on upping the price/quality ratio then I could see a very succcessful place."}
{"text":"This burger joint serves up some high quality burgers with all the toppings you could ask for.  The restaurant is clean and spacious and has 2 sections.  The first section doesn't have any tv's to make it a meal without any distractions and the second section includes 2 tv's to allow you to watch the Habs games if that is your thing.  I personally love the steaks here.  They are never frozen, fresh steaks with your choice of a side for 20$.  The steak is great, don't forget to ask for the garlic and spices to add a great taste.  Free drink refills as well.  To sum it all up, great value and great quality."}
{"text":"I went with a friend and she told me it was THE spot for Ubisoft techies at lunchtime. I was a bit skeptical.. but wow! what a nice discovery. I'm veggie and there portebello burger is awesome, there fries spicy enough and the price, forget it! You'll have plenty of $$ to party after:)"}
{"text":"I walked by this place for years and never considered walking in. It seemed generic, especially considering its perch in the 5000s on St Laurent, and it is always mostly empty. It took a sudden burger craving to push me in the door. Unlike most places, they will cook a burger to order (and something less than well done will actually emerge that way). The rich brown peppercorn sauce on their black & blue burgers is killer. Eggy, mildly sweet burger rolls. Very affordable. Good for takeout."}
{"text":"Pas mal pour des burgers, les quantités sont énormes mais juste assez pour les gourmands  les prix sont très abordables, un large choix et le service est excellent... À recommander"}
{"text":"3* for the food
5* for the service

A friend brought me to this joint to try their burgers which are apparently out of this world.

They certainly do have a vast selection at affordable prices. You can get your regular burger and add up to 16 (I think) free toppings! That's crazy...a place that doesn't charge you extra for toppings. You can also tell them how you want your burger to be cooked...you won't get that at McDonalds.

We took the black & blue burger and another one that was advertised as a specialty with king mushrooms (I don't remember the name).

The burger with king mushrooms was a bit blend but the quality of the ingredients was there. I would have added ketchup but my friend told me that I should eat it as is...I'm sure I would have enjoyed it much more with the ketchup.

The black & blue was actually a lot tastier...I love blue cheese so the pungent taste was very much appreciated!

Took a poutine with spicy fries. Skip the poutine, not good at all. They just added some spicy seasoning on top of the fries.

I must say that service was fantastic. The staff was very helpful when I said it was my first time coming and they came to check on us many times...almost way too many times. 

A way better alternative to the McDonald and Burger King fake crap you get for similar pricing."}
{"text":"french fries and burgers ok, nothing of particular but cheap for sure."}
{"text":"While they have 3 locations, I am very lucky to live a 5 minute walk away from the location in NDG.  

Their burgers are absolutely delicious.  Between myself and my friends, we have tried quite an assortment of dishes and we have never been disappointed. Their portion sizes are amazing for the price.  I remember I ordered a Caesar Salad once- it took three sittings to eat the whole thing and it was only $7.  

I have to mention- the Cantina Burger.  Oh my GOSH.  It is made with smoked mozzarella, pancetta, pesto, Mayo, Bruschetta and it is only $9,50.  It is my absolute FAVORITE burger.  I don't know if they will be adding it to the permanent menu or not but as special- it is a must try!  As always, you can add fries to any meal for only $2!

Their location in NDG is cute- it is a bit on the small-medium side for seating but as soon as you walk in, you see the 100% Canadian Beef - graded AAA and never frozen displayed along with the ribs and veggies.  You also see awards they have won on the wall including Montreal's Best Burger from CTV.  I always order for take away since I live so close but it does have a nice atmosphere if you would like to sit and eat.  Even while I was waiting for my meal, I saw the staff speaking to their customers as though they were all regulars.

Overall, it is a must try!  They have vegetarian options too- portobello mushrooms and grilled veggie sandwiches.  Ribs, steaks, poutines, milkshakes, chili, soup of the day, gourmet burgers with several free toppings... they have something for everyone!"}
{"text":"Love the food but the waiters got mad attitude and tells you where you can and cannot sit! Not acceptable as a paying customer I should be allowed to sit where I like. I also think they changed the salad size to go but they denied it . They really need to value their customers more and provide friendlier service."}
{"text":"If only I could leave no star,

Had the greatest raw meat in town.
Disgusting and dangerous.

Bought a cheese burger with bacon to take out. Once home the patty burger was raw, red in the middle.

Won't be coming back here.

Beware!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The hamburgers are delicious, as are the fries!  Large selection of drinks and food. Friendly service."}
{"text":"My brother brought a burger and poutine de Ville back home from work one day and I was intrigued after trying a little of the poutine. I finally decided to try some myself so I went and got a burger. It was definitely a great burger at a great price. I mean, $5 for a fresh burger with unlimited free toppings (they have a number to choose from with the usual suspects like tomato and relish but also harissa mayo, carmelized onions, mushrooms, and spring salad)! That's awesome! Usually, there is a limit on the free toppings or they charge you per topping. My brother and I went a week later and we each had a burger and shared a poutine de Ville and chili...those were super yum too! They make their gravy for the poutine from scratch with duck(?) which makes for a very flavorful poutine. Add the black pepper that comes with the poutine de Ville and it's a delicious take on a classic Quebecois dish. 

Overall, this place was a great value for a gourmet burger and poutine. I mean, you could spend the same amount at McD's these days so this place is totally worth it. This place takes cards. There is street parking at this location."}
{"text":"We walked int this place on a Saturday night around 6 PM only to find the place completely dead, with a few mere clients sitting down and the counter available to order. So we proceeded to order right away. 

I'll quickly admit however that I'm not a fan of the way the order process works... where you order at the counter, get given a number and have to find your table \"available\".

And when I mean by a table \"available\", I mean not used by other clients, being actually clean, without previous client leftovers or not missing chairs.

The service was not up to par to clean them and we clearly experience it during our visit with our milkshakes being brought to us almost a full 20 minutes after we ordered. The burgers arriving close to the 30 minute mark after we ordered at the counter.

But there was only a few clients ordering... so what exactly is going on?

I also got nervous when I realized that they never asked us how we liked our burgers and being not a fan of \"well done\", I dreaded getting my food.

Eventually, we got out burgers and they were quite tasty. The meat was medium and my toppings were there. 

The milkshake was very good but not the best I've gotten my hands on.

The cost isn't where it needs to be and I think it's a bit more expensive than it should be. 

However, Burger de Ville is a solid burger joint in my book. The meat is fresh and they have a huge selection of toppings to choose from.

Drinks are large and the refills are free for those who wish to know."}
{"text":"Burger De Ville is a bustling neighbourhood joint in Montreal Ouest. 

When we first walked in, I was a fan of seeing the fresh beef patties in their fridge as well as their steaks and ribs. The cheeseburger definitely lived up to my expectations. They have plenty of FREE toppings to choose from including some less conventional ones like caramelized onions and black pepper mayo. The spicy fries on the side were spicier than expected but I liked the kick especially with plain mayo for dipping. 

Recommended for a casual, quick and satisfying dinner!"}
{"text":"We were referred by a friend and decided to finally try it out and all and all the food was great. I'm veggie so they have the option to change your patty for a portobello which I had some reservations because sometimes the portobello is way too thick and your burger becomes very chewy. It came out great! Well cooked and thin. My boyfriend had a regular burger and extra ribs for 6$ and he was plenty satisfied. The only thing I would complain about is the lack of music. It ruins the atmosphere completely."}
{"text":"This is in my top 3 favourite burgers in the city. You can see them making your burger from fresh ground beef. The burgers are always fresh , juicy and made to order with lots of toppings to choose from (lots of free ones too!), they also make a solid poutine ! I tend to prefer to do takeout as there is limited room for seating.  I highly recommend this restaurant to all burger lovers !"}
{"text":"decent service (certain cashiers can be very friendly and nice while others not so much)
pretty good food, definitely the best quality you can get for a 5$ burger (in my opinion of course)
they have student specials if you're a student, which is smart for the two surrounding schools Loyola and RWA
the food can take a long time to cook (once had to wait 25 minutes during my school lunch break to get my order for takeout) 
because of that I only give 3 stars, because while the food is good, the atmosphere isn't great (it's often crowded with immature children lol) and it's difficult to eat there when you're on a short lunch break
also, the fries are sometimes undercooked or not cooked well at all
the other food on the menu isn't that good, their burgers are what you go for (their poutine is weird and their franks are subpar for small portions)
go for the burgers, they'll satisfy you"}
{"text":"Effectivement, bon burger ! Très abordable, viande de qualité, grosses portions, beaucoup de choix de garnitures gratuites (oignons grillés, champignons, moutarde de dijon,..) de plus les à côtés comme les frites épicées ou encore la salade césar sont quand même assez gros. Donc, si vous voulez, un délicieux burger de qualité, c'est la place à mon avis !"}
{"text":"Of so many burger restaurants in town, this is my husband's favorite burger place! He likes his patty barely cooked ('blue'), so he was so happy to find a burger place that does it. There are ample toppings to choose from at no extra charge, good buns, good sauce and the spicy fries are yummy. The restaurant is clean too, although the decor is a bit old fashioned - it looks like a very large version of your grandparents' dining room. I'm also not a big fan of dine-in restaurants that have tile floors. Makes me feel like I'm eating next to the bath tub. In any case I was won over by the man serving at the counter (he seemed like the owner or manager); when I was ordering my fries, he said the single serving was big enough for two people, so we just needed to order one. That was very kind of him!"}
{"text":"If you want the essence of a burger, this is the place you're looking for!!!! This is a mouth-watering restaurant that makes awesome burgers for a really reasonable price. Their meat is the best when it's medium rare!!! Fries are homemade! Free refills! You can also customize your own burger! Add anything you'd like to have in your burger! Simply delicious! Best place for a burger!!!!!"}
{"text":"I usually get the grilled chicken on caesar salad, great place a good prices. Just wish they had dessert to finish with. Great place"}
{"text":"Très bon burger fait avec soin. Nous avons le choix des ingrédients, de la base et de la sauce et c'est très appréciable. La viande est de qualité (fraîche et non congelée) et cela rend le burger très très bon. Les boissons sont à volontés et les Milkshakes sont excellents. Le service est comparable à un fast-food classique et l'endroit est très calme et simpliste. Les prix sont tout à fait correct pour la qualité et la quantité (moins cher qu'une grande franchise de burger...). Petit bémol sur les frites, qui, malgré cuites dans l'huile d'arachide ce qui rehausse le goût, étaient un peu trop dur pour moi. Je reviendrais sans hésité et je vous conseille d'aller vous faire une opinion par vous même!"}
{"text":"In Montreal on business, this was recommended by friends who know I like burgers. WOW! They grind their own meat, which means you can have a medium rare burger, something I have only had in Europe. If you are in the area of one of their current 3 locations in Montreal, and you like the simple pleasure of a great burger- I would say this is somewhere you have to check out. 

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Scary how bad this place has gone down hill!  Went back after a few months, an order for five came out one plate at a time, over cooked and dry. The fries showed up after we finished."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of the black and bleu, medium rare. I still cannot believe how inexpensive and incredibly delicious this place is."}
