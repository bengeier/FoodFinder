{"text":"We stopped by for some gas and ended up eating there as the store front was very clean and the people were great."}
{"text":"I tried them when they first opened and it wasn't good.  Everything is frozen and reheated/microwaved.  That includes the mac and cheese.  It's Stouffer's - straight outta the box from Costco."}
{"text":"If you love Fried Chicken, then this is a great place to stop by for a 3 piece and wedges. I have eaten lunch at the Deli a number of times and can't find one compliant. The service is excellent, the portions are excellent, the food is fresh and tasteful. The best thing about the Yorkmont Deli is the pricing, when you can eat a big lunch and not spend over $7 with a drink included, it makes you think twice about packing a lunch...."}
{"text":"I went in on a whim because the line for Subway was so long and the prices looked so good. I ordered a hamburger with potato wedges and a drink. Everything was less than $5 with tax, fantastic!

That said, when I got my food, I was less than impressed. The potato wedges were okay, not really my style, I prefer fries, and if there are wedges, I prefer smaller ones - these were giant - but they were pretty decent for what they were.

The burger though, was GROSS. The patty was clearly a frozen patty that was cooked at some point - I'm 99% sure it wasn't right before I ate it though because it tasted and had the consistency of something sitting under a heat warmer forever.

The staff was polite, but I will probably not be back to give it a second chance - even at these prices. I'd rather pay a little more and get real food."}
{"text":"Chicken tasted like it had set out overnight - stale, no flavor, barely warm. Also, no biscuits at 9:30 am and was rudely told that biscuits were only for lunch - despite \"breakfast biscuits\" being clearly advertised on the menu."}
{"text":"I heard from a buddy that place has amazing fried chicken. So I came in, ordered a three-piece meal, with a side of mac n' cheese and potato wedges. I must say, these guys have fried chicken covered. It was delicious!

My friend ordered a pizza, which was a tasty and valuable choice only because all toppings are complimentary. However, the juicy fried breast, thigh, and leg that I managed to eat all in one sitting were nothing short of amazing, particularly with their homemade gravy! Their sweet tea is very sweet, which I think works only in the South, haha.

The workers here are very friendly and polite. The owner of this restaurant is a sweet man, and is extremely approachable. The service is top notch!
I will definitely come back again."}
