{"text":"I retract my statement that Superior Pho is the best in Cleveland.  Flavorful, rich, lots o'meat, and not too expensive @ $8/bowl (I think).  Beats the nearby Vietnamese place for sure.  Definitely a no-frills place but the pho was great."}
{"text":"This family-operated Vietnamese restaurant is in the space formerly occupied by Long Phung. The service is wonderful. Our server was sweet, patient, and very informative. She explained menu items clearly while ordering, and again when the food arrived.  I had the Beef Pho, which was delicious. My table just loved the avocado shake."}
{"text":"This place was great. The food was great and very cheap and the noodle soup was yummy! The menu was a little overwhelming, but the waitress was perfectly happy to explain what everything was. Will be visiting again for lunch!"}
