{"text":"I am new to the idea of Sushi Burrito Bowl.  This place is very clean and neat. Would be nice to have a bit of background music nothing to loud.  There was only one person helping and seemed he was overwhelmed but he was very polite and I did not mind waiting.  I ordered the Crunch Salad I did not know what to expect but its not a dish that will take on my top 5 but that's my personal opinion.   I honestly will give them a try again with a different dish."}
{"text":"Glad they are finally open. Stopped in to see what they have, lots of fresh options. Got the surimi crab burrito and it was delicious. Also got a side of miso soup and enjoyed it as well. The place is super clean and employees were very friendly and helped answer my questions. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Being a health conscious guy I love protein and little carbs.. the exact opposite is what I got at California sushi burrito.. a ton of rice with a smidgen of protein wrapped in a commercial seaweed.. no fresh sauces, pony,soy.. and no wasabi.. again no fresh wasabi..no wasabi.. disappointing.."}
{"text":"My roommate and I decided to order two custom Sushi Burritos and both of us were quite pleased. While the contents of the burritos could have been more evenly distributed and the tempura wasn't actually crunchy (A detail pointed out in many negative reviews), the overall quality of the fish and flavor of the burrito was fantastic."}
{"text":"I stopped by here today after passing this location several times throughout the month. I saw one of their sign holder's coming up Sahara so I figured why not. The business wasn't that busy just a few customers. They have a basic menu. I decided to try the Salmon crush burrito As well as the seaweed salad. Both had very good taste nothing was offputting whatsoever. It's seem to be a reasonable meal for a reasonable price. The set up that they had was very similar to Subway sandwich store. Will definitely give this place another try."}
{"text":"Been here twice now, and the 1st time was fantastic, but the 2nd as good because the server and cook were different, the girl serving took my order 3 times and still got it wrong.. hard work to order with her. but the two guys that were on shift on my 1st visit were great. I will be eating here again. nice food."}
{"text":"Really good and fresh sushi here with food customer service. They have great mochi ice cream as well!"}
{"text":"Honestly the food is okay. The fish tastes fine, the brown rice was ridiculously hard which is just bad for a sushi restaurant. The worst thing about it is the serving size is atrocious. It's a bit sad when the Chipotle people across the street are scooping more than them. It's honesty laughable. It's impossible to find a good poke bowl place in this city where the serving size matches the price comparably to places in California. I really wouldn't recommend coming here with if you're looking for an all around good poke bowl."}
{"text":"I've had a lot of poke bowls and was intrigued by the sushi burrito concept. I had the original burrito (tuna, yellowtail and salmon) in a tortilla. Fish was fresh. Portions ample (at least by CA standards - they can be stingy with fish here).  The burrito was poorly wrapped, however. That does need a little work. My daughter had a bowl and was pleased with it. Service was fast and friendly. The only criticisms I have are that sides are pricey for what you get - $2.95 for a teeny tiny bowl of edamame! -that they need to filter the water in their ice machine - it was awful!  Had to dump our drinks and refill sans ice.  It's a new establishment. Hopefully they'll take Yelp reviews to heart and use them to improve. If so, I think the business will do well and I'll stop in again on my next visit to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"For being a new establishment ill give them the benefit of the doubt .. but hopefully they show some consistency because they seem a little unorganized and do not work timely. I have seen ppl walk in & right back out because they take too long. I had also mentioned that i did not want avocado in my burrito because of course its an extra charge. She made a mistake of putting it on, i mentioned it to her & told her its fine to leave it.. you would think that if a person mentioned they originally didn't want a certain item, they would put less of it...? Nope. Kept piling it on, i had to tell her it was more than enough. Overall, id say my order was decent. Nothing more, nothing less."}
{"text":"Very good food !! Best sushi in the area. First choice for a real treat! Nice portions, great staff."}
{"text":"Small portions of protein, about half the size of other sushi bowl/burrito restaurants. Stay away from the shrimp tempura or soft shell crabs, hard to say long ago they were fried. Overall sauces and flavors are bland and boring. Not worth a repeat visit."}
{"text":"\"Meh, I've experienced better,\" perfectly captures my feelings. SBB recently opened and they have lots of room for improvement. Prices seemed a touch high for what I got (the #1 bowl), not on par with the portion, quality, or competition. The bowl I received, while fresh, was skimpy (barely half-full for $11) and the flavors did not go well together. The sauce in particular was off-putting and artificial-tasting. I took my order to go, or else I would have asked for it to be remade.   Those who prefer to build their own bowls might be disappointed here, as the available ingredients are more limited than other places. The staff were friendly and the location is clean and modern, reminiscent of a froyo shop. They also offer a 10% Yelp check-in discount, but I am not sure I'll be coming back to redeem mine any time soon."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly and the food was pretty good for the price. They can make burritos without rice, which is awesome if you're counting macros. Great for a quick meal"}
{"text":"Been waiting for this place to open for a while. Finally went in and got a few burritos for the family. Place is immaculate and very clean. Staff was friendly and liked how they put a fresh pair of gloves on for each customer. The food was great and fresh. Got the seaweed salad side and some moche for desert. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"After a long day at work, I decided to grab a healthy bite since I'm too tired to go home and cook. First time here and it was very pleasant to the eyes. VERY clean. Food was very fresh. Had the REAL DEAL sushi burrito and it was exactly that... the REAL DEAL. Followed up with a side of guacamole and tortilla chips. Reasonably priced. My Tuesday evening just got better. Highly recommended for raw fish lovers. I'm glad I came. Will definitely be back on the weekend."}
{"text":"They are clean and so kind. I think I am going to visit them again:) I ordered happy tuna and it looks so delicious"}
{"text":"Wow what an amazing lunch today at Sushi Burrito Bowl! I'm so surprised. I drive by quite often and always see the bright white sign. I finally wanted to try the concept and I'm blown away. There is such a wonderful modern twist! You get a very fresh green healthy vibe with amazing and unique flavors. The servers here are amazing and help you customize any type of meal you might be interest in inventing on the spot!"}
{"text":"I picked this place because there was nothing else open at the time and I didn't feel like making a mess at the house. It was okay! Nothing more nothing less. I was kind of skeptical about eating at this place because I don't know how long the main ingredients (fish) sat in the containers so I went with a tempura styled burrito. The place was clean which is always a plus. The location is in a decent area. The food is reasonably priced nothing to crazy. I will not try this place again just because it was not something that I'd try again."}
{"text":"This is my first sushi burrito experience and I'm happy I stopped in for lunch! I got the number 4 (apparently 1, 2 and 4 are the popular ones) it had the Tempura shrimp and spicy surimi crab with the vegetables. Great size for price when comparing it to most any rolls out there at any other locations and very quick! The location may hurt them but when they pick up speed I think they'll be very busy! Almost forgot to mention the military/police/fireman discount, its 10%! Thanks guys, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"So far so good. I came over to this plaza for something else and decided to grab a little snack. Service has been great.  Food looks decent. Now here goes nothing....STANDBY FOR TASTING...very interesting concept. Sushi Burrito. Basically an oversized hand roll. Lol. Soooo... It was pretty good. Not expensive and curbed my appetite (that's hard to do). Bravo. Nice job. I'd come back."}
{"text":"Despite some negative reviews, I have to say my experience was quite delightful! The establishment was very clean and bright, staff was friendly and attentive, my fish proportions were perfect. I ordered the #2 burrito on soy paper with the addition of spicy poke sauce. So good and it's close to home! I will be back!"}
{"text":"The online ordering makes it really easy to create the order, have time to contemplate what you want and then pick it up! I've ate here twice now and it was consistently yummy. My burrito ends up being cheaper than any other place I've gone to. I also prefer the way they make it here, they're a bit longer and more compact as opposed to short, fat and spilling all over the place. Here's what I get: salmon, yellowtail, avocado, cream cheese, garlic ponzu, wasabi mayo, green and red onions, tempura crunch. Mmm! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Awesome burrito!! Owner is awesome and chef makes vegan black bean party from scratch.  Seriously delicious and great customer service! This will be our new favorite place. My hubby had the number 2, spicy tuna and crab and said it was awesome!"}
{"text":"I've heard good things about sushi burritos and couldn't wait for this place to open so I can try them out . I tried the #4 and I have to say I'm very pleased with the choice I made . The service was fast and friendly . I think I'll try the spicy tuna next ."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting!!  There is a terrible sewage smell that overwhelms the dining experience. The food was less than mediocre, and the workers were rude and acted like They were doing me a favor giving me food.  I didnt even finish my meal, and got up and left.  I will Never go back there."}
{"text":"Truthfully one star is being nice. The burrito was a mess and smelt fishy. The tempura was pre-made, so no crunch. You're better off going to any sushi bar or grocery store for that matter and ordering a roll of your choosing. Nothing to write home about.... Huge disappointment!"}
{"text":"Excellent. I was craving sushi and googled this place and it's minutes away from home. The staff is friendly and the food was fantastic. I ordered a burrito bowl, custom made and EVERYTHING was fresh. Ohh and the price point is ON POINT. #Yas  Try it out for yourself. I guarantee you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The only thing that was really good about this place was the inside was clean and bright. There's only two people working behind the counter. One was preparing the food and the other was a cashier. There was only two people in front of us and we still waited in line for a good 20 minutes.  The food was just OK. My burrito fell apart as soon as I opened it.  There was a lot of sauce making everything a mushy mess. I tried a piece of my wife's shrimp tempura and it was way too soft and too mushy.  I doubt that we will be coming back"}
{"text":"I came here every day for a week. It's so delicious. I create my own burrito. I first came here months ago and made my own burrito but the things I had them put into it just didn't taste good. Once I figured out what is good for me I became hooked. Try one of their signature burritos if you are clueless on what to put in your burrito like I was. You can sample any sauces or ingredients too.  Very clean. Very friendly service. Once I had to wait for the rice to be done cooking so they gave me a free soup while I waited. Great customer service. Again, very clean."}
{"text":"My pops and I were lookin for somethin on the healthier side for lunch today, and I happened to find this place on yelp. I was feenin for a poke bowl, and this place was nearest to work so I decided to give it a try.  However, I should have trusted the fellow yelpers and avoided this place.   The workers were really nice and courteous, but they acted as if they've never heard of tuna poke. I told them that I wanted a tuna poke bowl, and then they asked me how I wanted my tuna seasoned. I referred them to the picture of the tuna poke on the menu, and they said that they have to mix the tuna in a bowl to make it look like that lol. Sure enough, the tuna turned out looking nothing nor tasting like tuna poke.   Unfortunately, this place just didn't do it for me. It's dead silent with no music playing, and the food is as mundane as the restaurant's name. Although the ingredients were pretty fresh, the portions were small. We left unsatisfied, and I don't know if we'll ever be back."}
{"text":"This is probably the best Sushi Burrito place in the Town !! We ordered for Delivery  and i was surprised how fast the food was delivered - exactly 19 minutes !!! Great job Sushi Burrito !!!!"}
{"text":"Why do I stinkin love this place so much?? Oh ya, because it's PERFECT!   Parking is awesome , plenty of space :) - I live that. The restaurant is immaculately CLEAN! Spotless I would even say. The staff clean , professional and very knowledgeable about being vegan. They even have a vegan option sushi bowl! Awesome!!!!!   Food is AWESOME!!!! Go there right now!!! Amazing !!!"}
{"text":"At first glance, Sushi Burrito Bowl looks like a welcoming and clean environment. The clean part is right, but it's not very welcoming. The staff aren't very friendly or helpful. There was no music playing which I didn't like. It was strange the staff didn't seem trained on how to interact when customers walk through the door. No smiles, not asking us what we wanted to order. Just stares.  The items on the menu were laid out but they didn't mention that they serve tofu which was a very exciting surprise. They also offer a vegan patty and have the vegan sauces clearly labeled. After creating your burrito they roll it with their hands and not a mat, so the burrito isn't very tight. I don't eat fish but it definitely didn't look like great quality. The food was alright but the options were limited and I hope they expand and try out different toppings."}
{"text":"Overall, this place deserves 3.5 stars for being decent. It's a little sushi bowl spot that will satisfy your basic craving. I was looking for a quick lunch for take out and drove by this place, decided to give it a shot.  I was greeted right when I walked in, not busy yet since they had just opened at 11am. The storefront is nice and clean, only one table was occupied by the manager and his family I think. The girl behind the counter (Shayla?) was friendly enough, she made sure to make eye contact and smile. She patiently waited while I browsed the menu. I wish she was a little more engaging. Usually other establishments try some anticipatory question or remark to help the customer. It would have been nice if she tried a little, maybe inquire if I had questions, or if it was my first time here. Especially since it was slow business time. However, she was attentive enough while I placed my order.  I ordered the custom bowl with salad as the base, salmon and yellowtail as my proteins, then seaweed salad and edamame as toppings. The bowl was complete with the garlic ponzu sauce. Quality of the fish was good, and the flavor of the sauce complimented the ingredients. I do think the portions are a little small, which is why I added the salmon after I saw what the yellowtail scoops were. The toppings available left more to be desired. Did I miss the masago (smelt egg)? That's my favorite topping! Price was decent, about $11 for what I ordered.  Would this be my go-to spot for a sushi bowl? Probably not. Everything was ok, nothing more or less and I've experienced better in town. Would I come back to try it again? Absolutely, because at least they have room to make small adjustments for better results."}
{"text":"So this was not my fist sushi experience but it was my first sushi burrito experience. Seriously delicious. Love the fresh salmon and tuna with Ponzu... The staff was friendly and service was quick. Will definitely be back here to quench my quick sushi fix."}
{"text":"I walked in and it was my first time. The place was super clean and the workers were very nice. I love sushi burritos and decided to give this place a try! I ordered the #2 which was the spicy tuna and it was amazing! I loved it a lot and the sushi was nice and fresh. Defiantly going to come back again :)"}
{"text":"The burritos were not properly wrapped and a lot of the ingredients came out. One burrito had no sauce one had too much sauce. Otherwise the burritos had an above average amount of protein and a solid flavor. Too many jalapenos in the #1 but still good. The ceviche surprised me by being excellent. A healthy amount of shrimp and for the price was the best part of the meal."}
{"text":"Never again. I would say that I'm pretty knowledgeable about sushi burritos and poke. I've been to multiple places and had my fair share of great experiences. I decided to go here since it just opened I was hoping for an above average experience. First off the presentation was not that great the employees said hi and basically that's it. They didn't explain the menu or anything. They also didn't really seem like they wanted to be there making me feel the same way. I ordered just a standard salmon burrito with seaweed salad. And my friend ordered yellow tail. The burrito was poorly wrapped and began to fall apart upon eating. Not only that, the seaweed salad in the burrito was hard and I mean hard. I always eat seaweed salad and I couldn't even bite into it and had to take it out of my mouth multiple times. I pushed that aside and continued to eat. Here's where it takes a turn for the worst. My friend took a bite and what happens?? A piece of hair! That's unacceptable especially being a brand new place! I never write reviews this long but the fact that I always eat sushi burritos. This is very disappointing. If you've never had a sushi burrito before than by all means try this place out, however, if you like sushi burritos a lot then I would highly recommend going somewhere else."}
{"text":"The food was fresh but the wrap was the worst I have had want able to eat it as a wrap once I opened the paper up it fell apart so said."}
{"text":"I always go to the water store next door and think \"looks great. I have got to check it out one day. \"  Well, that day was today, and I am really happy I did it! Had a \"real deal\" sushi burrito. I cannot wait to have another one soon.   I had a nice chat with the worker (byron). Very friendly and attentive service."}
{"text":"My family has eaten four times now. Each time the food is fresh, plenty of variety, portions are average to good, and friendly service. The reason I won't give a five is the first two times we had Byron as the cashier and all was good. The third time we went we had another cashier (don't remember her name) and when she gave us our receipt she also gave us an additional receipt and told us to text the words shown for free food. We were thrilled as this is starting to be our \"go to\" fast food place, and we were excited thinking this promotion just started. However, we went again and Byron was again working. The order was given and when we got to the cash register to pay, Byron placed the promotion receipt on top of the cash register - where there were many other of these promotion receipts. Byron asked if we wanted our receipt and we said yes, as well as the receipt he just put on top of the register. Byron instantly gave it to us and we left, but it left us with a bad feeling that we were getting ripped off while Byron was giving these promotion receipts to his friends or keeping them for himself for free food. Food was great, place is really clean and gives a feeling of healthy, but hate being ripped off."}
{"text":"Worst experience I've ever had at an establishment. When you walk in nobody greets you, they just stare at you until you order. It's actually quite awkward. None of the ingredients are fresh, avocados were old and brown, shrimp tempura is soggy, all the fish were dry and had a very strong fish odor to them, this list can go on and on. Just don't go here. Stick to and more well known sushi burrito joint."}
{"text":"A disappointing experience.   This place mirrors similar sushi bar concepts elsewhere in town but the service was unfortunately dull and the sushi burrito itself was strangely dry and limp.  There was exactly zero other customers in here when I came in, got my order and went out.   Not a good sign.  Also I must confess I was worried about how fresh the fish was and if the seaweed was refrigerated enough.  But I was so hungry I scarfed it all down despite my reservations.   Luckily did not get ill but I do wish I read earlier reviews before I went here and knew that other customers got sick - it does not surprise me."}
{"text":"I'd never go back to this place. It's my day off and I was craving a bowl, I wanted to try a place that's close to my home. Saw this was two miles from me so I went and spent a little over $10 for the worst bowl I've ever had. The spicy mayo sauce was like none other I've ever had before, and I don't mean that in a good way. the restaurant was bright and clean but the sign outside that says \"the best bowls in Las Vegas\" is a lie and should be taken down. My craving isn't satisfied and I'm bothered I wasted money on going to this place, I've had better, way better"}
{"text":"Service was friendly, food was good. Big spacious dining room and I love that they have build your own bowls or burritos. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Good convenient location Been hear three times this current time i placed order over phone they call me back to tell me they ran out of rice and I was told it would be 30 minutes so I canceled my order over all this place is not a great poke place there crab meat and sauces are pretty good though but deff lacking in topping verity and are a bit pricey"}
{"text":"I paid almost $10 for a Sushi Burrito with grilled chicken and avocado. The food wasn't fresh. The chicken was that same rubbery microwavable stuff that Subway and other fast food places use. It wasn't that filling.  Overall, just not a good value. You'll be way better off heading over to a real sushi place. Hanabi is a good place in the shopping center across the street."}
{"text":"Besides the awkward atmosphere and no greeting, I'd say giving this place a 1 star is being nice. My boyfriend and I are fans of sushi burritos and recently moved in the area so we thought we'd give this place a shot. I ordered a #5 which comes with shrimp tempura, the tail was still attached, it was pre-made and not crunchy at all. Once we left after throwing 3/4 of our burritos away, afraid of eating old fish and getting sick. We got home and sure enough I became sick and threw my burrito up and my boyfriend has been in the bathroom with stomach cramps. Do not eat here."}
{"text":"So good. Good price. Miso soup was great too. Staff was excellent. Definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"Told me that the soft shell crab was gluten free. It was breaded. They have no understanding of food allergies nor do they care. Told them I was going to eat somewhere else. They did not seem to care at all."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice now over the past 3 days and they've consistently done a fantastic job.  The price is really affordable too - they definitely don't skimp on the fish and fillings."}
{"text":"Used to love this place, it's highly short staffed but sometimes it is worth the wait if the long haired guy is there to make your burrito.   Some other dude there made my burrito and it was nothing like what I was used to.    Plus they now only offer flour burrito vs the other choices they had.   All in all expect to spend 15 minutes waiting before you get out of there.  Which is horrible if I am on my break"}
{"text":"Came with my friend to check it out since it's close to my house. Made my own burrito and I see the yellow tail wasn't good right when they opened the container. Smaller sizes than most sushi burrito places but not bad for the price. Biggest turn off for me other than the yellow tail was that after three bite into my burrito I see a hair what ever happened to hairnets????"}
{"text":"Was next store and had to stop. Kid working (long curly hair dude) super nice. This place is so clean. I work down the road and never knew it was here. I know we would all rather come here then some other options. Super excited to have a place so close with such nice employees."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! Dave helped me today and he was very awesome. He was polite, gave me enough time to look at the menu and helped whip up my Chasing the Dragon sushi burrito.  It tasted amazing! I got a combo with seaweed salad which is a favorite of mine and that also was great. They also offer delivery which is a must on lazy or busy days. What more could you ask for?!"}
{"text":"I eat here everyday just about every single day. I have read some of these other Yelps and it surprises me because I work next door and I never saw any of the stuff mentioned here. But hey, that is their experience. I love the food and I have been eating here since it opened. I give this place more than 5 stars."}
