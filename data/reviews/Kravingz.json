{"text":"Such an adorable brunch spot in Clarkson: nice interesting menu and their fried chicken and waffles was 10/10!"}
{"text":"Just had brunch here today. It was a great experience. Mississauga definitely needed a place like this.  The staff are super friendly and helpful. We called ahead for a table and even thou they dont take reservation they had it ready for us when we reached. The space is small but even when the restuarant was full it didn't feel overly crowded.  The food was delicious and portion very generous. I think they are reasonably priced. Everyone in our party finished their meals and were very satisfied. My favorite was the waffle with jalapeño- yum! My husband enjoyed The islander 'jerk corned beef' stating it was flavorful and deeeeelicous:)  We would visit again."}
{"text":"Our family of eight visited this location recently and was pleasantly greeted by all of the staff.  The restaurant is on the smaller side but is comfortable, modern and inviting.   We had two small children with us that were patiently catered to, as needed.   Best of all the food was delicious!!!  The salmon with eggs benedict was divine.  We will definitely be going back for more!"}
{"text":"OMG. Awesome food! Reasonable prices! Friendly, fun staff! Come early because the place fills up fast. I had \"The Usual\" and it was superb, especially the potatoes. My companions had Eggs Benny with salmon and they raved. Really good coffee as well. I'll definitely be back to try the rest of the eclectic menu. Only caution is the steep, narrow stairs to the bathroom. Watch the top step. Would not come here with my 83-year-old mum for that reason. Otherwise, Kravingz rocks!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem in Clarkson. Glad I don't have to drive all the way into the city to get good brunch anymore.  Good vibe, good food, good people.  The Islander is a must order dish."}
{"text":"Type: Restaurant Rating:  WIFI: Yes / Free Visited on: July 9th, 2017 . SERVICE The service is really good! When we walking to the restaurant we where greeted with a smile from our server and show as to our table. As soon as we sat down he asked us if we want anything to drink. Our server was very attentive until the crowed started to coming, unfortunately he forgot about us after we received our bill. We waited for about 10 minutes for a machine (point of sale machine) to arrive, but unfortunately it didn't arrive. We ending up walking to the counter to pay our bill.  . FOOD For breakfast I decided to go big and have their \"Chicken N' Waffles\" with house coffee. Let's start with the waffles. Waffles has made with bacon and jalapeño. When you take your first bite of that waffles with the jalapeño, it was an explosion of flavour in my mouth, the jalapeño \"bam\", the bacon \"bam\". If the only offer the waffles as a stand alone... I'm all over it! How about the chicken? The chicken was not overly battered, but there is enough to give a crunch to it when you take a bite in it, even when you pour a heavy amount of maple syrup. The chicken is bone less, but doesn't say in the menu so when I was eating, I was looking for the bone. It will be nice to mention that in the menue. The coffee is typical, same coffee you get in any restaurant.help . CONCLUSION This is our third (3rd) attempt to eat here for brunch. This place is so busy you do need to coming in early. They don't take reservation for brunch so if you do decide to come here you should consider showing up before 10am to beat the rush if not, it's first come first served. Would I came back here again? \"Oh ya! I'll come back\" . Amateur_Critic"}
{"text":"Had brunch here last December holidays to try out their Filipino breakfast dish (longsilog). We also had the normal breakfast of egg, bacon, sausage, as well as the waffles. The food was good. For the longsilog, I would've preferred if they held the ketchup on one since I don't take my sausage with it. Waited a bit for our food because the order was somehow forgotten on one side (?) but the good thing is that the host realized it and offered us complimentary pandesals (sweet bread), which were really good. It was a good experience. Would probably go back. Ambience was good, not too crowded during breakfast rush."}
{"text":"Food quality & originality is top notch. Thier salads are sincerely fabulous. Gets busy on the weekends, so expect to wait for a seat. Ambiance is a tad noisy (room has bad echo acoustics) but totally makes up for it with taste. Prices are reasonable for what you get."}
{"text":"Great little place off of Lakeshore, nice parking too.  Came with a large group about 8 people. Had the Mexican eggs dish, and it was really really well made. Perfectly poached eggs. Really good combo of flavors, nice side of homefries and tortilla chips too. Thumps up for choices of hot sauce as well.  Server was very nice and attentive. Will come back for sure."}
{"text":"This place is an amazing hidden gem. We went there for brunch and everything was great. The 20 min wait to get a table was well worth it.  It wasn't just the brunch itself which was great but even things you don't usually think about (coffee, bacon, etc.) were also of noticeably high quality.  Will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"A rare breakfast gem! We're from out of town and decided to try Kravingz based on other Yelp reviews. If you didn't know where it's located, you could easily drive right past (an unassuming storefront). The interior is very cute, modern and clean... And most importantly, the food is absolutely DELICIOUS made with unique combinations of ingredients. I had the Flip Side, which was heaven on first bite. My boyfriend had the Polski Benedict (with salmon) and his was the same. We also had 2 fresh smoothies (these took awhile to make, but worth it) and a cappuccino. Highly, highly recommend if you're in the Mississauga area!"}
{"text":"Our first visit to Kravingz was a hit with the family! We walked into the restaurant around 1:15pm, on a Saturday, and it was slightly busy. They have a 3 person bench for those who are waiting for the next open table, but it was already occupied. So they offered to take my cell number and we walked outside to enjoy the beautiful sunny day. I received a call less than 20 minutes later, for our table of four.  The menu is small, but it is enough to entice you to want to come back and try ever dish on it. For our mains, we ordered The Klub, the Golden Waffle, and 2 of The Flip Side, with 2 sides of Pandesal. As for The Klub, the husband found it crunchy and filling, but the lettuce gave it a somewhat bitter taste. As for Golden Waffle, the often finicky teenaged son hardly put any syrup on it, which gives high praise for the flavour of the waffle itself. With The Flip Side, our more food-adventurist young daughter and I both gave a hearty sigh after our first bite. Because we are familiar with the longanisa, we were a bit skeptical by the unfamiliar casing of the resto's version, and the fact that it was double the size of the norm. But that first bite said it all. Tasted just like my Mom makes it, but we'll never tell her that. Usually garlic rice can be over-powering, but this one was subtle, yet still flavourful. All these dishes were truly filling. Yet, we had to try a dessert, so we had the daily special, Churros. It came with vanilla ice cream. We polished it off in less than 2 minutes, 'cause we were trying to be polite, and not the animals we would have been, had we been at home. The Churros were light and not heavily doughy, with a good sprinkling of cinnamon. We may need to order it with 2 scoops of ice cream, next time, 'cause it was delicious.  Overall, we had a great experience. The wait time between ordering and plating was typical. From the reception to the departure, all the staff were exceptionally welcoming. We don't live close to this area, and their business hours aren't optimal for our busy family, but we will definitely make it a point to get to this restaurant at least once or twice a month. Which is such a shame, because if we could, we'd be here at least once or twice a week. Guess it will just take us a little longer to try ever item on the menu. Challenge accepted!"}
{"text":"Decided to come here after seeing it on instagram and yelp. I had the chicken and waffles and it was so good! Nice big portions, chicken seasoned nicely and waffles had jalapeño in it. Service was great. They also gave us a taste of their house made tiramisu cake which was amazing. Definitely coming back here to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place and I do, but it didn't wow me. Went at 1230 on a Saturday with the family and waited about 10 minutes to be seated. Service was friendly and they were doing their best for a full house but I noticed several tables waiting for something or other for extended periods. Coffee was good, bulgogi sandwich was spicy but delicious, fish tacos were spicy too but very well executed. Heart of celery soup was fresh and a bit grainy. Good if you like that texture. Freshly squeezed orange juice for 3.25 wasn't really worth it. Didn't visit the bathroom. Decor is bright, fresh, contemporary and welcoming. Nice touch that they had coloring placemats to keep the kids busy."}
{"text":"Everything was perfect!!  Food was delicious and they put a spin on the typical breakfast options.  Happy to have found this place.  This is exactly what is missing in sauga!!  Small joint (vs big chain) with fresh ingredients, high quality, flavour and great ambience!!"}
{"text":"Love each and every dish I've tried here. I really like how they blend some different flavours and it all works out great. Have been several times, And will be going back again fersure"}
{"text":"Fun place to grab brunch with a decent selection of options of different palates. Like that the menu has the usual bacon and pancakes, but also poached eggs with vodka cured salmon. Unfortunately I can't attest to the flavour of those options. As a vegetarian, I did order the  Chilaquiles Rancheros, and it was pretty good though a tad soggy. Looks fancy in photos though!"}
{"text":"Amazing food!!! I'm still thinking about it! The flip side was so flavourful and the longonisa \"filipino sausage\" was homemade. My hubby had the biscuit and gravy which was also delicious because the gravy had chunks of sausages and the biscuit was pandesal \"filipino sweet bread\". The decor was also nice and let me say, their bathroom was clean!!! Breakfast restaurant bathrooms are always a nightmare for me, but i was super impressed that theirs was clean! Keep it up! And see you guys soon!!"}
{"text":"Arrived on a sunny Saturday afternoon. Had to see what all the hypes about. Fusion food and Filipino dishes sounded great.   When you first arrive, instant home comfort feel restaurant. The Tiffany blue accented colours were satisfying to look at, the modern furniture adds a great atmosphere to the restaurant. Once we arrived, we waited for 10 mins to sit, understandable for it being a beautiful Saturday afternoon.   But let's be transparent:  Fancy furniture and bright colours doesn't equal to good food or service.   First order meal: The Flip Side: Home made longanisa, crunchy garlic rice & fried rice. This is a traditional Filipino \"brunch\" dish. I give this restaurant a high five for introducing Filipino dishes. Rare to find. As for flavours, the taste gave a similar taste to the traditional longanisa sausage but being Filipino myself, it was very mediocre. I'd suggest if you haven't had longanisa in the past, this dish will set a low standard to introduce Filipino foods. It was okay, we did ask the waitress to cook our egg with no yolk... And it came extremely runny.  Second dish: The Polski Benedict: Potato Placki w/ vodka cured salmon or peameal bacon. Poached egg & Hollandaise sauce. I chose the salmon. Great dish, very tasty. I asked for hot sauce and they surprisingly gave me a large selection to choose from. Awesome fusion between mixing hot sauces with Hollandaise sauce and the yolk. I'd have this dish again.  The bad: Asked for coffee, requested 3 times for a refill. One of the waitresses asked, brought the coffee out to another table and I'll assume she forgot about us. Reminding her again, she said she'll brew more...after 10 mins we decided to just get the bill and leave. Once paying, we shared our feedback and it was an immediate apology, we still ended up paying $2.50 for a \"bottomless\" coffee as they say, but it was disappointing service... good luck getting a refill on your water.   We came for the hype and left disappointed. It's great for families and mediocre food, but I won't be coming back to this restaurant.   Better service, higher attention to details with their customers and an introduction to their menu with knowing the names of the servers would be appreciated for future customers."}
{"text":"great food and service, great for breakfast, brunch, or lunch"}
{"text":"My friend chose this place for her belated birthday dinner (my treat)! I was originally going to go for their Original, which at $9, comes with three eggs, toast, home fries, bacon and sausage.   However, I decided to try something different and ordered the Chilaquiles Rancheros (fried tortilla with two poached eggs and some tomatillo salsa, black beans, corn, peppers, etc.) as well as some home fries and fried tortilla chips. It was quite tasty and obviously, as brunch food, it was fairly greasy as well.  My friend ordered their chicken and waffles, and we were amused to find whole pieces of jalapeño peppers inside it! The coleslaw was super tangy, and the waffle was quite soft - but since it was bland in flavour, it definitely needed the syrup. She also got the green'n'healthy smoothie, which contains banana, lime, honey, spinach, avocado, and coconut water. At first taste, all I could get was the banana, and then the lime undercurrent drifted in...  A little pricey, but a cute and quaint spot!"}
{"text":"The best breakfast spot I've been to. They have amazing chicken and waffles but the go to for this place has to be the eggs Benedict"}
{"text":"The reviews about Kravingz are true. We had the Br'egg'fast burger with beef stew, and the Chilaquiles Rancheros with a lava cake for dessert. Great food and service."}
{"text":"The good news is that the decor here is lovely and the service was friendly. Although the waitstaff were amiable, the actual service was quite poor. It took a long time for our server to greet us. When she did come over, we ordered tea and water. It was nearly 20 minutes for just the tea to arrive and no water - despite a friendly reminder. We then ordered our mains (the eggs benny) and sides of fruit. It was about 45 minutes or so for those to arrive, no sides. The actual food was okay, but not something I would go back for. Hopefully it was just an off day, but I don't think I would try this place again because neither the food nor the service were good.  Overall, the best part of the meal was catching up with my old friend."}
{"text":"Cute little place with some really creative menu items. Teal and white décor takes you back in time.  I got the Flip Side which is house made longanisa (Filipino pork sausage) with crunch garlic rice and a fried egg which was delicious!  My friend had the Chilaquiles Rancheros. And she must have enjoyed it since it keeps wanting to go back.  Great place for a unique take on breakfast :)"}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place out. We got the flip side benedict, chicken & waffles, side of garlic fried rice and longanisa, and also chocolate chip pancakes for my son. Everything tasted great... Just wish my meal didn't end so soon cuz I finished it so fast. Lol. We will be back to try more things on the menu :)"}
{"text":"Great food but the service was quite pathetic. They seemed understaffed as well as staffed with under efficient people."}
{"text":"Special omelette Charles Bronson was delicious. Great little place to ride or drive to. Kids menu as well."}
{"text":"I could've sworn I had a review for this place but it seems I nightdress deleted it in my sleepless yelp browsing?   I had this place bookmarked some their soft launch and it took me over a year to finally find the time and opportunity to try it out. With only an hourto spare between the kiddo's swim lesson,  I rushed here and grabbed a table for one and explained my situation to the server. She was more than accommodating, ensuring I met my timelines and still had a delicious meal.   Despite all the deliciousness on the menu, I was pregnant at the time and my baby demanded spicy food (I ate SO much spicy food while pregnant) so I ordered the chicken waffles. For those who are planning to go here just for chicken waffles, make sure you read the menu - these chicken waffles are SPICY. Like, jalapenos cooked into the waffles spicy. Like, dripping with spicy syrup spicy. Like, drink 5 glasses of water spicy. SO. GOOD.   While scarfing down my breakfast, I secretly wished I had company so I could sing praises of the food, but mostly just so that I could eat a second plate of breakfast without feeling silly.   The atmosphere here is great, the seating space is open and bright, not crowded at all, and though the bathrooms are down a flight of stairs (killer for preggos, but probably not a big deal for ... non-preggos?), they decorate the walls with drawings from little kids that make your heart melt so it totally makes it awesome!  I will for sure come back here again - any place that has chicken waffles is good in my book!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to try this place out as we live nearby, and we wanted to try something new & different then the regular breakfast places in the area. I loved the atmosphere and decor. We were seated almost instantly after we walked in which was nice. The service was great. I ordered the Biscuits N' Gravy & he ordered the Clint Eastwood Omelette. I would definitely get it again it was absolutely delicious!! I gave it 4 stars though, because my boyfriends meal was more of an 'egg wrap' rather then an omelette, as all the topping were rolled into the middle. His toast also came toasted with no butter or jam, so it was obviously dry. Not a big deal though. Overall the food was great, I will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Late lunch on a lazy, hazy, rainy Saturday...  Polski Benedict with salmon and biscuits and gravy with eggs.  Coffee and fresh squeezed grapefruit juice for liquids.  Food was all good.  Biscuits and gravy delish and the salmon was perfectly cured and not too salty.  Eggs cooked exactly as ordered and the yolk made for a nice gravy on the salmon and the potato pancake.  The only thing I don't like is that the acoustics or lack of it makes for a noisy dining experience.  The place was half empty and it was pretty noisy with the few tables where some people feel the need to tell their life story to the entire room.  Definitely a place to add to my weekend go to haunts."}
{"text":"Place is legit! It's a brunch place with a mix of Filipino and polish cooking fusion. The sausage is a must try! The service here was absolutely phenomenal was treated like a million bucks!! The waffle with fr sh fruit was tasty my fav part was the diced up melon!"}
{"text":"The place is very small from outside. We almost missed it. Inside is a very comfy, clean, cozy place. The staff are very friendly. We waited a bit longer than normal for the food to come and good thing it's worth the waiting. All the food and dessert we tried are sooooo delicious!!! Gravy and biscuit, pancake, \"the usual\" (egg, bacon, sausage, potato, bread), peanut butter and jelly cheese cake, apple crumble ala mode. Will definitely gonna come back to try the other food."}
{"text":"Cozy little restaurant with cute decor. The restaurant wasn't too busy on Monday at noon so that was a plus, we got greeted and seated right away. The waiter was welcoming & friendly. We ordered the eggs Benedict & the basic egg/sausage/bacon/hash brown/toast. It was so delicious! And displayed very nicely too. We got our food quick as well. Great atmosphere, great food, great staff, definitely recommend this place for breakfast and lunch!"}
{"text":"Came here around 2 pm for the first time and I was definitely Kraving some lunch. My friend introduced me to this place and was raving to me how great the food was so we decided to give it a shot. Upon entering, I was impressed at the ambiance of the place. The restaurant gave a homey feel and the waitresses were very welcoming and friendly.   What I ordered was:  THE POLSKI BENEDICT (potato placki w/ vodka cured salmon or peameal bacon. Poached eggs and hollandaise): As for this dish, I went along with the peameal bacon instead of the salmon. When the dish came out I was very happy with the presentation as it was visually appealing.The green garnish made the dish vibrant and the hollandaise was just drenching down the poached eggs. As I popped the eggs, it was oozing all over the entire plate; just the way it's supposed to be. The poached eggs were cooked to perfection, the bacon was nicely prepared (not too salty), the holldandaise was very creamy and overall; everything was nicely seasoned.  However, I personally felt there were a few downfalls of this plate. Unfortunately I didn't taste too much of the vodka flavoring anywhere within the dish. I found it interesting how the potatoes were thinly sliced for the placki (placki; a polish potato pancake) but the main problem was the sear on it. The color of it looked awful (possessively it's suppose to be that way from the looks of the other pictures) and I was expecting it to be crisp. It probably had lost its crispiness due to the fact that the heat of the bacon, eggs, and sauce were on top of it because the polski was hidden underneath. Furthermore, I felt like there was way too much hollandaise and would have preferred it on the side.  As for the service, I was kind of disappointed on how long it took for my friend and I's food to get out. We were waiting 32 minutes and the place wasn't busy at all (only two tables were currently seated). But, what I love about this place (and recently learned) is that everything on the menu is made-from-scratch and they support local suppliers!  If you're in need of some breakfast/lunch and want to try something new, you should give this place a try. As for myself, I didn't adore the food, but I wouldn't mind coming here to try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place out because of the distance and Yelp reviews. We had to put our name on the waiting list and waited for about half an hour. I had the chicken and waffles and my boyfriend had the waffle. The food was amazing and one of the best chicken wnd waffles I've had. We also had a green and healthy smoothie each and it was delicious. I would definitely go back here. It seemed like they were under staffed because a few tables had left and it took them a while to clean and seat people. I would give it a 5 star for the food but gave this place a 4 star due to the wait and the place was a bit small with tables close to each other."}
{"text":"Love this place, we've been going here with family since it opened and now it's hard to get a seat!!!!   The place is clean and staff has always been helpful and friendly.  Food is tasty and delicious. I've tried almost everything on the menu, without disappointment.  I would recommend this place if you want something special than just your typical breakfast joint. The portions are large and everything is nicely seasoned. Get there early if you can,"}
{"text":"First time here earlier today for brunch and I was happy we decided to choose this place! I can understand why they chose the name of this place after eating here!   Very cute spot perfect for brunch! Service was great, decor was vibrant (chic and fancy look with a 'at home' feel). The menu was pretty unique too - there's options you don't usually see anywhere else (they give a different twist to things you would normally see, for example the eggs benny on top of a potato placki AKA polish potato pancake)   I personally enjoyed the food a lot because it felt nice and fresh for a meal. Portions were good - just the right amount to fill you without making you feel gross.   We ordered the Polski Benedict and the Chilaquiles Rancheros. Both delicious!   Excited to try the other options next time I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"If I had to describe my experience at this place in one word, it would be: poor. In two words: extremely poor. I enjoyed the eggs benny and chai tea latte, however the service was very subpar and inattentive. When we walked in, we stood at the door for about 5 minutes before somebody even greeted us, and another 5 before we were seated. Keep in mind this restaurant is very small so the staff have a view of the door at all times. Upon being seated, it took several minutes before our server even greeted us and took our drink orders. To eat, I ordered the eggs benny which was decent, however the service had already left a sour taste in my mouth so I barely enjoyed it. My friend had the steak and eggs and complained about it being mediocre and not cooked well. Needless to say, I will not be coming back here again."}
{"text":"UPDATE: I came back to give this place another go with my baby and brother. This time, the service was a solid 5/5 and the food was gold stars all around.   The only thing that kind of bugged me was a group of four women who were over-the-top laughing and talking SO loudly. The restaurant had a Top 90's mix with Spice Girls and Backstreet Boys, which was really fun but the girls were belting out to the music and it ended up being like a sing-a-long show in the middle of the restaurant. I could appreciate the fact that they were having a good time but when I come out to eat, I like to let other customers enjoy the ambience, I try not to bother them with my own banter and I usually keep the singing to the privacy of my own bedroom or at least a Karaoke bar.   My brother ordered the Bulgogi Heart & Seoul, while I ordered the Fish Tacos. Both were amazing and took about 15 minutes to come out. They brewed a fresh pot of coffee for us and filled it up throughout our meal. A gentleman even came to check on us and see how our food was. This was definitely a step up since the last time I was here and they definitely redeemed themselves. However, this time it was pretty empty in the restaurant (just another lone man and the four girls) so I'd like to see if they've improved their service when it gets busier.   I'm going to give it a 4/5 rating because I'm not sure if this type of service is consistent or not. Guess I'll just have to come back to see!    ORIGINAL REVIEW: 3/5 stars   If you're looking for amazing breakfast and a cute restaurant with nice ambience in Lorne Park area, this is the place.  My friends and I ordered the Polski Benedict, Heart & Seoul and Pancakes with fruit and home fries.   Our waitress was super nice but it was only her waiting the tables so once our food came, we didn't get checked on. We didn't get our coffees or water refilled and when the home fries didn't come, we couldn't grab the waitress until we were finished our food. We had to wait so long for it to get to the table and the chef brought it out to us and apologized. I personally believe that it should've been taken off our bill ... Regardless, we still had a good experience. I hope the wait staff is on top of it next time.  Thank God the food was amazing: the Heart & Seoul bulgogi meat melts in your mouth but the French fries weren't my fav. The home fries were really good though!   I wish I could've given this restaurant a 4.5/5 but the service we received just killed the vibes so it's a 3/5 from me."}
{"text":"Something different. Expensive for certain things, but it's Mississauga. Can't avoid that."}
{"text":"I came here after reading the reviews on yelp and this place is worth a visit if you are into brunches.  Now getting here is a bit difficult because it is easily missed when you are driving along Lakeshore Road.    We ordered the Steak N' Eggs, The Islander, The Omelette.    The portions seemed a bit small for The Islander but otherwise it was good.  But we were sharing and the Omelette was cooked with a lot of eggs and it was filling.  The steak in the Steak N' Eggs was cooked just right for us so we were happy there.    Where it loses marks is the coffee, it tasted burnt and after getting a second cup, it still tasted burnt.    I would still recommend this place though for brunch."}
{"text":"The food at this place is so delicious, it'll leave you...krave.... forget it.  No more puns.  I really have yelp to thank for finding this little treasure of a restaurant, as I never would have bothered to travel this far for what would appear to be your run of the mill breakfast joint.    My partner and I decided to visit this place around 3:00 for a late brunch, and was greeted by a small, cozy restaurant, along with some friendly staff.  We were quickly seated and given menus to order.    One thing that really threw me for a loop was their menu selection.  For a American (Traditional) restaurant, this place had some really un-traditional selections!  Filipino food (pinoy represent!), Korean dishes, Mexican Cuisine - you name it!  If I wasn't so dead set on grabbing the Chicken and Waffles, I may have been really stuck deciding what to get. Ashley got the Polski Benedict, and I...the Chicken and Waffles. We threw in a plate of breakfast sausages, because hey - it's a breakfast house right? Gotta try the breakfast items.  Now, I won't go around touting my in depth knowledge of chicken and waffles, as I've only ever had it once before in my life... but with that in mind, I can easily say this was the BEST Chicken and Waffles I've ever had in my life. I don't know how to really explain it;  everything just...worked.  The waffles had a savouriness, and a little heat (think I noticed a few jalapenos in there), and the chicken had a very delicious blend of spices in the batter.  The chicken itself was very flavourful, and extremely moist/tender.  Mixed with the simple syrup for the waffles, every bite was amazing. I think I would have preferred the coleslaw separately, but that's probably because I'm a picky eater. Also wasn't the biggest fan of the beet(?) coleslaw.  The Polski Benedict was also very delicious...at least I'm pretty sure it was.I only had a combined total of 2 bites, as Ashley devoured it before I finished taking pictures of my plate. I'll use her total eating time as a further testament to the food quality here.  The breakfast sausages were run of the mill... in other words, delicious. Can't say much more on that front. If you're the type of restaurant who messes up breakfast sausages, you seriously need to reflect on your life choices.  Finally, their service was pleasant.  I brought up the fact that I hoped they would consider expanding their business hours, to which I found out they were planning to do so! Come the New Year, they're going to be expanding their menu selection, as well as their hours.  I can only hope my heart will last the upcoming festive season, so that I can torment it further with their new food selection.  At the end of the day (well technically 4pm, since this place closes SO EARLY), I'm extremely happy with this cozy little restaurant that really seems to put their heart and soul into their food items.  With a relatively decent price range, and food selection for all walks of life, I would definitely recommend this place to those who are...kraving...some good food.  Sorry, couldn't help myself."}
{"text":"I'm a bit of a brunch newbie but Kravingz just blew me away. They got some incredible and unique twists to classic menu items that should please anyone.  So this place was really unsuspecting, especially with their really basic signage, but as soon as you walk in, you are greeting with a simple and modern interior. The atmosphere was perfect for brunch. It's very welcoming, in addition to the amazing waiter we had.   We tried their chicken and waffles and the polski egg benedict and I was super duper impressed with both. That chicken and waffles is easily the best chicken and waffles I have ever tried. It's just got so many wonderful elements that makes it just so unique. The bacon and jalapeno waffle has a light smokiness in addition to the slight tinge of sourness from the jalapenos. The bacon dressing had some citrus and additional smokiness coming through, while the coleslaw added that acidity and tartness. That cabbage really did wonders to this dish. Combined with the crispy and peppery chicken, this dish was just perfect. It was a truly a party in my mouth in terms of the mix of flavors and textures.   The eggs benedict also had a very unique spin to it with a potato placki base. This was amazing. It was peppery and had this nice griddled flavor to it. I'd take this over an english muffin any day! Egg was perfectly poached, and there was cured salmon here (which I also like better than smoked salmon, which would be a bit too overpowering). Again, extremely well balanced and nothing too overpowering.   So overall, I'm super impressed with Kravingz's unique twists to classic items and just can't wait to try other items on their menu!"}
{"text":"Not much to add that hasn't been said already. Nice looking place, super friendly service and a fun eclectic menu.   Mi wife had the Heart and Seoul sandwich with a side of hot and sour soup. Both were great. I really enjoyed the Islander so much that I wish there was more on the plate. It was a bit light on that tasty jerk corned beef for the price.  Would return and recommend."}
{"text":"The chicken and waffles, did I say the chicken and waffles? Did I say to go now and get them? You should. The service can be a tad uneven but the food is worth the wait, and to be fair it's typically super busy so what is a place to do? Why not chill and people watch then dig in to a breakfast that really does fit the bill of kravings. So good I'm glad it's close enough to justify repeat visits whenever I get the urge to combine sweet and savory."}
{"text":"Probably the worst service I've ever received.  There were only 3 other tables when we were seated.  Took forever to get them to take our order.  Never got our drinks refilled or got the water or cream for coffee we asked for.  Found eggshells and burnt crisps from the bottom of the pan in our food.  Told the waitress twice and she didn't do anything about it.  Had to mention it again when we went to pay and they \"took off 5 percent\".  No offers to recook the meal or take it off the bill altogether.  It got busy really fast but I have to say that's no excuse for the poor service.  Never coming back."}
{"text":"Cute little brunch place. I got the salmon eggs benedict and my boyfriend got the chicken on waffles and they were both quite good. The waffle even had bacon bits inside it! The place was fairly small but cutely decorated. The prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"Really cute and clean atmosphere with very friendly staff. Unfortunately those were the worst eggs Benedict I've ever had. All I could taste was vinegar and because the salmon was so cold the meal was less than room temp. I just spent $20.62 on an egg and a half and two very greasy potato 'pancakes'. Off to my usual spots in Toronto where $15 will be well spent. And I can get a mimosa."}
{"text":"From the decor to the service to the food FIVE STARS! This is an  amazing Filipino  brunch place The chicken & waffles are to die for and if you want to try something different get the Flip Side with home made longanisa sausage. Delish"}
{"text":"3.5 - came here for lunch and I was pretty excited about trying a new brunch spot. The outside is very unassuming I like the decor inside, it's cozy, light and welcoming. They have really good coffee with free refills. The menu is small so you won't take forever to pick. We got a veggie burger and fries and a sweet bun.  The burger was good! Very different it said chickpea but was mostly potato, and fried to be crispy. It is far from a healthy veggie burger but delicious. The fries had a great seasoning on them. The sweet buns were mediocre.  The issue here was the service, not the food. I understand we came after the rush and everyone was probably really exhausted. The staff was very very nice, but completely inattentive. We had to wait for way too long to put in our orders and we needed a few things and had to actually walk up and get someone because it was clear after awhile no one was checking on us. Keep in mind there were only about three people here at this point. The chef was so awesome though! He came out and asked me about options for my veggie burger to make it vegan. And when the order was ready for pick up and the bell rung and the servers didn't come get it (they were not busy again) he came out and around grabbed it and brought it to us.  I rounded up for the chef, he was great and the food was delicious. Hope next time the service is better though."}
{"text":"This was my first breakfast spot....and I must say it did not disappoint! I had the Polski Benedict and a hot chocolate.  Both tasted amazing!My sister had the Chicken and Waffles, which tasted pretty good too. However, they do serve it topped with coleslaw which she said they could have done without.  Overall though, if you love breakfast food...I highly recommend you check this place out!!! Also, I do think the food was reasonably priced...both meals were pretty filling for the both of us. I hope to come back and try the other specials too."}
{"text":"Went with my family on a Sunday afternoon in a nice, quiet area in Clarkson....very very small place that doesn't take reservations so you need to get there early and put your name down.  We were told about an hour so we walked around to waste some time, went to the antique store across the street, really cool, lots of great stuff to checkout.  We came back to check our wait time and it was still a bit longer because we had 7 people but the servers were really nice about it and they had a table of 4 pop up so they offered us to take it until the other two tables cleared so that at least a few of us could sit down....I waited with my fiancee and sister in the main entrance and the server came over and offered us coffee while we waited which was really great.  Once we got our table we ordered and the food didn't take long to come out.  I ordered the breakfast burger and it was amazing!  It was messy as hell because the first bite I took the yoke from the egg oozed out.  Very tasty beef patty and bun, the side of fries were delicious and had a really nice seasoning.  Everything we saw come out of the kitchen looks amazing!  Great food, really great service but only wish it was a little bit bigger so the wait times aren't as long but definitely would come back."}
{"text":"Awesome food with a great decor.  I went with the fried chicken and waffles on my first visit. The chicken was tender with very skillful use of cloves (in the brine I think).  Combine that with bacon/jalapeño waffles and real Maple syrup and you've got a winner!  Staff is friendly and the decor is beautiful. Make sure you show up early to avoid a long wait."}
{"text":"Summary: Don't know how to do takeouts yet, food is OK, not bad not great.  Went there yesterday around noon for a brunch takeout. The place was completely empty and the staff asked if we wanted to sit down, we politely declined as we had to be at some place.  They took terribly long to prepare our food considering there was nobody in the place except us. When the food was done, they didn't have any bags to give to us as they said they ran out of a lot of supplies because yesterday they had a lot of customers due to mothers day, alright. So we had to carry takeout boxes in our hand, thinking this food better be great.  We reached home, opened the food, turns out they forgot to include White Bread for Steak and Eggs, and sauce for Chicken and Waffle, not cool! we got incomplete food.  I called them and told them about missing stuff, they apologized but there is nothing else they could do, i'd hope they don't do it to anybody else.  The food was ok i guess, onion soup had no cheese, steak was a little stiff and chicken and waffle, well it had no sauce.  The only good thing i see is the ambiance/environment they have going on, bright blue walls, sunlight coming in gives it a very cute look, one thing people look for in brunch/breakfast places.  I hope they get their stuff together."}
{"text":"Cute And cozy atmosphere not much seating.   Staff is friendly. Food was tasty. The home Fries had a little too much seasoning and tasted salty. The salmon was delicious and fruits were fresh.  I tried the pineapple mimosa I wish the pineapple was stronger"}
{"text":"My friend recommended this new brunch place and I have to say it is definitely awesome. I called ahead of time to ensure the bar area is available. When we arrived, Kravingz had a number of small tables to choose from and as I expressed that I had a back injury, the staff did all they could to ensure the bar area was as convenient as possible for me. They shifted a table near the bar area to make room for standing room which was super sweet of them which also showed beyond excellent customer service. The chef also came out to help with the shifting- really appreciative of being so accommodating! All the staff were so friendly and nice and my experience started off perfectly.   Once our (bar) table was ready, we were promptly asked for drink orders and served very quickly. I loved how they have a bright/lit up sign for their soup/omelette of the day. I ordered the NaNa's soup which is a classical Portuguese soup with sausage and vegetables. It resembles like a chicken noodle but without pasta of course. For the entree, I got the Chicken'n'Waffles. The portion size is generous and this dish is perfectly done. The chicken is nicely fried, crispy and the bacon&jalapeno waffle was delicious! My fiancee ordered the BR \"egg\" fast burger and by the end of the meal, his plate was clean- I'm sure he loved it! The burger itself is big and tall and has a lot of yummy goodness in it. The beef patty, peameal bacon, mushrooms, onions, potato and the runny EGG! I had a bite and I enjoyed it. All I could think of at the end of the meal was a nap. On the menu, there are a number of items to choose from so if you want something lighter- they also have those options.  All in all, the service here definitely won my heart as it is not always easy to find places that are accessible and accommodating (Thank you Kravingz!). The food is yummy and amazing- give it a try!"}
{"text":"Checked out Kravingz because of all the buzz around it, and in my opinion, it lives up to the hype.   Decor is simply and modern, in white, grey and aqua, gives the feel of \"if I were to decorate my kitchen, how would I do it?\"  Came here for Saturday brunch, and as it is a popular brunch place, we had a small 15 minute wait, which isn't horrible. Staff is friendly and they do their best to check up on you.   Food is pretty fantastic! We ordered the chicken and waffles, and the Polska eggs Benedict. Both were delicious, came out hot and fresh and in good time, but the star is definitely the chicken and waffles. The waffles are spiced nicely with jalapeño and cheddar and the chicken is boneless and tender and juicy and perfectly crispy without being oily. A must order!   In total I would give them a 4 & 1/2 stars, the only thing that was lacking was I requested a coffee refill which never came, but the food is worth it here"}
{"text":"Nice cozy spot for fusion breakfast around the world.  Islander: 4/5. Mash underneath was authentic. Corn beef could use a bit more spice.  Mexican breakfast: 4.5/5. The salsa was lit.  Green n healthy smoothie: 4/5. refreshing for morning, the only problem is that the banana wasn't ripe enough."}
{"text":"Great service. Had the flip side eggs Benedict and it was very tasty and the perfect portion. It wasn't too salty or heavy either. Waffle and fried chicken weren't greasy either. Only thing missing was a mimosa:)"}
{"text":"I order BR fast burger. It was huge. The sauteed onion and hash brown under the paties are awesome."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant. My girlfriend took me here for a brunch date and I wasn't disappointed. I got the Mexican style breakfast, and although it's loaded with heat (I came back the next time and asked them to go a bit easier on it, which they did with no problems!) it's also PACKED with great flavors. I love that it's not your regular breakfast meal, and you leave not only full but incredibly satisfied.  The service is great, too. The workers are really friendly and accommodating, and really make you feel right at home. The prices are a little high for a breakfast joint, but I remind myself that the food isn't that of an average breakfast joint, and there's definitely a lot of effort that goes into it.   Can't wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"Kravingz is a great, modern brunch place nestled right off the main drag. The food is qualitative, diverse, and worth the price point.   Stopped by for a mid-day Brunch on the way back to the States. Got the steak & egg plate, which included a well seasoned house potato, watermelon, two pieces of toast and jam. I left delightful filled.  All-in-all a nice little place to stop by for a quick bite."}
{"text":"SO good! We were in from LA and needed a Sunday morning spot for a killer breakfast and hit the jackpot. Restaurant is cute and quaint, seating is limited so get there by 10am on the weekends. Staff is great and food is amazing. Had the Islander and Salmon Benedict, both of us were in the clean plate club, worth the wait!"}
{"text":"We had a friend visit us from Alberta so we wanted to take him out for a good brunch. After doing some Yelping, Kravingz came up on our search for Mississauga places. It certainly fit the bill! The location (near Lakeshore) was a little far for us but it's totally worth it. It's in a small plaza with other small establishments. We got there around noon on a Saturday. Unfortunately, because it's a very small place and you cannot make reservations we had to wait 15 minutes. There isn't too much space inside to wait so keep that in mind if you're coming in the middle of winter.   Food: I'm Filipino so it was so cool to see some options that were familiar to me growing up. It definitely made my decision tough. I ultimately ended up going with The Islander: 2 poached eggs, plantain chips, corn beef hash and smoked cheddar grits ($13.00). I love anything with cheese so this called out to me. Overall these ingredients worked really well together. I especially loved the grits and plantain chips. I appreciated the restaurant accommodating my request for over hard eggs. My husband got the the Polski Benedict: 2 poached eggs with vodka cured salmon, pea meal bacon on a potato plaki and hollandaise sauce ($14.50) He said he liked his dish but did like my corn beef hash slightly more. I wanted to add that this dish (plus several more) are gluten free. My friend ordered the Usual: 3 eggs, bacon, sausage, home fries and toast ($11.00). He is usually very particular with his food so it was nice that he really liked his too!  Service: It wasn't too bad. Not overly friendly but not mean either. My friend requested \"basted eggs\" and the server wasn't too sure what it was but did make an effort to find out.   Overall experience: We loved it! It's such a cute little place that's filled with so many items from Ikea (my husband and I are huge fans!) so it really suited us. We've discussed coming back to try other dishes. I can't wait to try the ones with longanisa. I took a star off because of the fact that we can't make reservations. There isn't a lot in the area to do while killing time."}
{"text":"I passed by this place not to many times since it open but i never bothered to go in . Until i read some of the reviews ppl had posted.First i just want to thank the friendly staff for setting up a table for 5 and 2 small kids.I called ahead and said i wanted my table to ready at 1400, and they delivered. I ordered my fave Biscuits and gravy . And i must say i was impressed ,ive tried biscuits and gravy at other places but so far kravings has them beat.if i had to pick at anything it would that i like my gravy on my biscuits lol but iam sure they can accommodate that.I also got a side of their jerk corn beef hash.I guess i needed something spicy, once again i was pleased An issue i had , dont know if anybody else noticed this, was that the place itself was way too hot.One of the servers said they cant control the heat in there.Not a big deal for me.I will be coming back here."}
{"text":"Came by for lunch on a Wednesday. Not too busy. Seated right away. Cute little place. Very interesting brunch menu w some international flare. I ordered the polski Benedict and my friend ordered the chicken &  waffles. Polski Benedict a underwhelming. The vodka has was interesting. But the hollandaise sauce was tangy. But the chicken and waffles was so damn good. I hate waffles but the jalapeño bacon infused waffles were delish. Coleslaw wasn't too sweet nor creamy...and chicken was moist. Kinda wished I got the chicken and waffles instead. Price is fair.. Nothing outrageous. Would return for brunch again."}
{"text":"So happy I came here! I was originally looking just for a place that had mimosas, but the food was amazing too. I got the usual, and my boyfriend got the chicken and waffles! On top of the food and drinks being good, the interior is so cute, and the service is super friendly! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Came here around 9:30am on a Sunday. Not busy at all. We were one of 3 tables there.  I ordered The Flip Side and my friend ordered The Polski Benedict. The wait time for the food was kinda long. I'd say 20 minutes or more. I asked for my egg to be well done because I hate runny yolk. I also asked for tomatoes on the side because if you're Filipino, you know longonisa is not complete without tomatoes lol.  They gave me 3 big slices of tomatoes and even seasoned it for me, which was nice. However my eggs were still runny. Bummer. I cut out the yolk and just ate the whites. The longonisa was great! I enjoyed it. My friend seemed to like her meal too because she cleaned the plate.   Unfortunately, the service wasn't there. Only once were we checked up on, which was right after our meals were brought out. It wasn't too busy either. It took awhile for me to be able to ask for a take out box and for someone to clear our plates. It wasn't so bad though. I will return to try some other things on the menu."}
{"text":"By far one of the best brunch places in Mississauga. If you're looking for something cozy and warm, check this place out!   We were promptly seated as soon as we got in. Few others waited, but was a short wait time. The decor was nice and inviting. Waitress was very sweet & attentive.   We ordered the following: 1. Chicken and waffles. Rate 10/10. SWEET BABY JESUS were the words that followed after my first bite. This is a must order if this is your first time here. The waffle had a bit of spice to it and the chicken was nice and crispy. Add some syrup from the table and prepared to be wow'd. Would definitely order again!   3. Eggs Benedict. Rate 9/10. Different take to the original recipe. Instead of regular English muffins we got the Filipino version which was sweet and tasty. Felt like the meat was minimal, which is why I would take 1 point away from perfect. Would order again! I enjoyed the chicken and waffles more though."}
{"text":"Very cute little resto! It can fit about 30 people. We were immediately sat at around 11am but people started to come in and line ups by the door started to get longer.  Their menu is very international from filipino cuisine to jamican to polish. These are all brunch items and ofcourse you still have the waffles, pancakes and the usual protiens like sausage and bacon.  I tried the flipside and it was super yummmmyyyy homemade longanisa sausages are the bomb dot com! The jamican dish was soo good as well. We enjoyed a sweet ending with an apple tart and ice cream which was very satisfying.   Great place to brunch with friends and family"}
{"text":"3.5*, rounding up to 4*. Points for food creativity, ambiance, and variety to the menu, for sure. The menu has a mix of brunch and lunch fare from a variety of cultures, so it's an interesting mix of dishes. Located on Lakeshore Road W, west of Port Credit and just east of Lakeshore Road W and Clarkson Road - this place is definitely unique to its location and akin to many of the cafes and brunch spots you might find on Queen West or something similar. Definitely trendy, décor is bright and appealing, and the effort to branding and ambiance is definitely there.  We arrived on a Saturday around 11:15 AM and were seated right away (but note that by the time we left around 12:15 PM, more people were trickling in and there was a lineup). They do take reservations so I'd suggest making resos if you don't want to wait.   Parking is free, it's located in a small plaza with a decent amount of parking.  On our visit, we ordered: a) The Flip Side ($11.00) - Filipino sausage with garlic white rice and a fried egg, b) The Islander - jerk corned beef hash with cheddar grits and poached eggs $12.00), and c) a Café Latte (I think around $3.00), and d) a tea (I think around $2.00).  While the décor and ambiance is wonderful, we actually weren't totally wowed by the food - overall, a very average meal. Also, I wasn't a fan of the Cafe Latte at all - it had a very burnt aftertaste.The Islander was fine, but for a dish fusing multiple cultures and flavours together, I guess I was expecting more in terms of taste. It tasted like regular corned beef, very generic, and the cheddar grits were fine but very average/flat. The poached eggs that came with the Islander was really rubbery, and the texture reminded me of a rubber band. Also, it was a bit cold. Out of everything, I guess the Flip Side stood out - the sausage was sweet, delicious and very fresh. But altogether, it wasn't a meal that totally wowed us - it tasted fine, but not more than average.  Service was also quite slow - once they got busier, the less we saw our server.  Yes, the spot is charming and is a unique brunch location that's welcome in West Mississauga - the ambiance has all the ingredients for a nice little brunch date with friends and loved ones in a nice environment. So, I'd still recommend it for the overall experience. But perhaps come with lower expectations about the food's tastiness - in our case, while the concept of the dishes are unique, it didn't end up being as tasty as we expected.  Overall, 3.5. For two people, with tax and tip, we paid around $35.00."}
{"text":"Had Brunch here today. The place is very small, doesn't seat many so I would advise you to make reservations.  We were seated in the back of the restaurant adjacent to little window where the kitchen is.  I ordered the fried chicken with waffles. Although I didn't care for the slaw that it came with I would have to say that it was very tasty. The chicken was very moist and shredded very easily with your fork and knife. Waffles were nice too, I couldn't figure out what the seasoning they used on the inside of the waffle was bit it was a new taste for me that I'm not use to when eating waffles. I will definitely ask next time.  Service was very good. Several waitresses came by to ask how I was enjoying my food, even the cook behind the window asked me how I was liking my meal.  Never have I ever been given a shoutout but the cook, pretty cool!  I will definitely be back, next time with the hubby and kids.."}
{"text":"There's a buzz about the place alright.  After hearing a lot about Kravingz as the hottest new breakfast, lunch and brunch spot in Mississauga I went for breakfast on a Saturday morning around 11:00am. This is one of those places that you might might just drive by and write it off as a strip plaza diner but then realize when you go in that it's anything but that.  Kravingz is a small-ish space that's new, bright and comfortable and seats about 30-40 people. The staff are friendly and the menu is creative. Beyond that, they have a few issues that are common \"new opening\" pains. Shortly after 12 noon the place got jammed and new guests were being told 20-30 mins. Being busy is a good sign of a new restaurant. However my perception was that the people in there were a combination of \"got to try the new place\", \"my GF dragged me here\" and \"what am I doing here\". Together with a few repeat customers.  For the food itself, I chuckle when restaurants use square plates to give that \"modern\" feel and higher prices. In this case the dishes looked cool but my breakfast was a little less spectacular. To begin with, there is that familiar feeling one gets when you order 15 minutes ahead of 2 other guests that come in after you and you get your meal 15 mins after they get there's. And it's even more frustrating when you get your breakfast and have to wait a further 10 minutes for the toast (which goes together with eggs like peas and carrots). Again I think this is just logistics and they will work it out in time. Reservations should definitely be taken (I don't think they are at the time). As for the taste, the eggs were OK but the meats were undercooked and the bacon was really greasy. The Waffle with Fruits plate was OK, but the fruit quantity was a bit on the light side. I may be a bit too critical but at $15 for 3 eggs, 2 small pieces of peameal and 2 strips of bacon with some home fries, I guess I expect a bit more in terms of taste.  The interior is a little \"too nicely designed\" and I say that with respect for the restaurant which receives more customers than it can handle. The chairs and tables are very comfortable and I can see that being a problem in terms of turning tables at the rate they'd like to. Finally, I believe the ventilation needs a bit of work. We walked out an hour later smelling like breakfast."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love breakfast...especially weekend breakfasts..wake up late..no rushing to get there or leave...I love weekend breakfast.  The problem is trying to find a breakfast place or restaurant that is not the same old pancakes, bacon, eggs, toast...etc.  My wife and my visiting mother in law were out scavenging for a place to eat for breakfast on Sat and I found a place on Yelp which caught my eye..it was actually the homemade Longanisa that made me hit the \"Get Directions\" button on the app.    Kravingz is located in the Clarkson area of Mississauga (south of the QEW) in a small strip mall off Lakeshore Rd W.  It has a modern and casual seating with a small cafe feel to it.  We were quickly greeted and seated.  The service here is quick and friendly and it's very easy to get help if you need it.  The menu from what I was told is the culmination of food adventures that the owners have experienced over years of travel, plus there is some homegrown influences as well.  Filipino, Polish, Jamaican, Southern, Mexican cultures and influences pepper the menu.  This is not your regular breakfast/comfort food restaurant.  Being Filipino, I quickly gravitated to the Homemade Longanisa and the garlic fried rice with egg (aptly called \"THE FLIP SIDE\"), but then my wife said she was getting the same meal.  Not wanting to order 2 of the same thing, I opted for \"THE ISLANDER\" which was jerk corned beef hash with corn and cheese grits with a poached egg.  My mother in law preferred a traditional pancake with a berry compote with toast.  Our order was taken and we also ordered freshly squeezed OJ and coffee.  The coffee by the way is locally roasted by a father and son team and it is quite good (I had 3 cups).    The food came quickly and there was a few things to watch for.  My wife is not a fan of spicy foods, but when she ordered \"The Flip Side\" it was dressed with banana ketchup (a mildly spicy ketchup), it was not mentioned in the menu so she had no idea.  Plus if your not a fan of ketchup...make sure you tell them.   The longanisa on her plate on the other hand was quite good and the garlic fried rice was excellent.  My meal \"The Islander\" was an interesting mix, although I liked the hash..the corn and cheddar grits was not the right texture for me.    If your looking for a unique alternative to breakfast/comfort food and your in the Mississauga area, give in to your Kravingz and give em a shot....4 stars"}
{"text":"I have been hearing about Kraving for a while now and decided to check it out today. I had read that it gets really busy so I called ahead but they told me that it wasn't that busy and we got a sit right away. As per most of the reviews the service was really good except it took a little while for them to come by with the machine for us to pay.   For the food we had the chicken and waffles and the pancakes. The chicken was moist with crispy skin and the waffles where alright but I was expecting more based off the previous reviews. Also with Door 55 just up the street I would say that their chicken and waffles where better. Also the waffles where supposed to have jalapeño in it but the mix wasn't really spread over the whole waffle. You had 1 or 2 bites that had some kick to it and the rest was kind plain.  The pancakes where fluffy, but a little dry, even when you added syrup.   Over the place was good, but I don't think will be a place I will be running back to."}
{"text":"Comfort food with a fusion twist. Great flavors in well thought out dishes and fantastic service to boot. What's not to like? I could eat here every week very happily.   Jerked beef hash over grits. The grits were perfectly creamy without being too watery or thick, the jerked beef hash had the perfect amount of light heat, and the unsweet banana chips for texture were perfect. Best single dish I've had in ages."}
{"text":"First time visit to Kravingz and it won't be my last!  The food was phenomenal, the service was excellent and the atmosphere was brilliant!  I'd suggest this little joint in a heart beat!   I had the cheddar grits with Jerk corned beef hash and poached eggs w a side of their house made Filipino Langonisa sausage! Good god! Delicious!  My brother tried their omelet of the day which consisted of pulled pork and smoke aged cheddar and of course w a side of the Filipino sausage too!   If ya don't know now ya know....! Go get some!"}
{"text":"Wasn't sure how I would dig their Filipino dishes, being Filipino. But they delivered! I had the longanisa breakfast. The rice was mediocre, but the l had longanisa had a great flavour with a European touch. Eggs were bursting. Pandesal on the side was great. I suggested to the server that they add a traditional side of \"atsara\" (pickled papaya and assorted vegetables) to the longanisa dish to add a bright note that it really needed. The atmosphere and staff were lovely. See you folks soon."}
{"text":"Finally got around to doing a review of this place! It's a such a cute ma and pa type place in Clarkson with its teal walls and white tables and chairs. Service is good - attentive when needed but lets you enjoy your food and conversations. Prices are also reasonable with everything between $11-$16 I think and the portions are great.   I've tried their On the Flip Side dish, which is house made longanisa sausage with garlic rice, sauce and sunny side up eggs. It was delicious and full of flavour - the longanisa in its peppery goodness was definitely the star of this dish and so much better than at other places I've eaten it at! It went well with the other components of the dish.  My husband got the jerk corned beef hash with cheese grits and poached eggs which was also delicious. It had the perfect amount of kick to it and it was very filling.   Support this local gem - I definitely recommend going and looking forward to my next visit to try some of their other delicious dishes!"}
{"text":"My friends and I are looking for a good breakfast place on our way to niagara. We came across this place and decided to try it out. We are a large group so we called in to make reservation but was told they are surprisingly not busy on a saturday morning. When we get there there was a long wait. We waited for an hour before we were finally seated.   We were so excited to try the different food on the menu. We ordered the flip side that have filipino sausage(longganisa), egg and rice. Not the usual longganisa you see most of the time in other filipino restaurant, it is home made. I find it too garlicky for my taste. The breakfast burger has peameal egg and hollandaise sauce, comes with fries or soup or salad. I got the shrimp and corn chowder which is not bad. It came out real hot and as you eat it there is a kick of a little spice. Nothing special for the burger. My husband ordered the steak and eggs which is also just the usual one we find in other places.   Overall the food is just ok. I like the little cozy place they have. Service needs improvement."}
{"text":"Really good joint for brunch/lunch. Good alternative to the downtown brunch spots. We had the chicken and waffles the biscuits and gravy and the omelette. Food was good and servers were really helpful. The service was a bit slow, but other than that everything was grey!"}
{"text":"A perfect typical breakfast experience with interesting menu items like Phllippinian sausages and buns. The staff is very nice. The room is cute and bright. They serve breakfast all day although they are closed for dinner. Their omelettes are fulfilling and hearty. The coffees are great."}
{"text":"Favourite cute brunch place in Mississauga! I've been twice and havent been disappointed. I've tried the steak omelette and salmon eggs benny. I reccomend both! A bit of wait some mornings, but definitely worth it! The aesthetic, food, and freshly squeezed juices are all on point."}
{"text":"I was excited to come here because of how good the menu looked, but was let down. I arrived with my SO on a Saturday morning, and ordered the salmon Benedict (~$15) and the Islander (~$12), but both were bland. The potatoes of my Benedict (which was supposed to replace the bread) were still raw, and eating unsalted raw potato wasn't a good experience. The cheesy grits of the islander weren't very cheesy, and tasted like stale corn chips. Gave a star for good service, though it was a little disorganized. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Fantastic place. Cute. Fresh orange juice. Jerk island breakfast. One of a kind. Worth the trip. Excellent prices too. Definitely go here for brunch"}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place. Everything on the menu is delicious and they got some very unique takes on classic dishes."}
{"text":"The chicken and waffle was phenomenal. Worth going back. Hubby had the poached egg and smoke salmon and got really bad food poisoning after. He was so sick and never wants to go back. I probably give it a shot again"}
{"text":"Very cute cozy brunch place we visited for the first time. Came around 10am on a Saturday and had seating available. They have freshly squeezed orange juice you can order and fresh smoothies. We ended up getting the usual something breakfasts that come with your choice of egg, baked beans, a choice of a pancake or toast, fresh fruit and home fries. The pancake was so fluffy and yummy and the home fries were fried goodness. We substituted the baked beans with grilled tomatoes and it tasted great with all the other items we had. Would love to come back and try their other menu items!"}
{"text":"Three of us for late breakfast-lunch today and we all left happy. I had a Mexican themed meal with poached eggs chorizo, tamales and perfectly cooked home fries. Waffles and bacon cleaned down to the crumbs! The third person had a Lebanese? Plate with eggs, home made sweet sausage and garlic rice. We'll be back."}
{"text":"great service and cute location, I just didn't really like the flavours of the food I had (I had the ranchero). my friend agreed that her meal didn't really do it for her either (some type of eggs Benny?)"}
{"text":"What a joke . They don't take reservations.  It's a small place. But they have a 12yr old girl doing seat assignments in such a small place!  We tried to eat here on 2 occasions. ... once with only 2 people , the other with 4 people.  each time after the 30-45min. wait they told us it would take, we were still not seated.  They have no clue how long the wait will be.  They let 1 person sit at a table that can accommodate 3 people.  They should seat singles at the bar!  Then they put 3 people at the only table that seats 4-6 people!  The portions look small.  No ambience.  Ikea tables & chairs.  Go if you have nothing better to do with your valuable time but sit & wait for an uncomfortable table in a cheesy diner setting with no ambience.  Why do people put up with that when there are so many other good restaurants around who respect the customer's time & comfort?!?!  & when we told them we were leaving , they didn't even have the courtesy to apologize for making us wait for 45min. in error or ask us to come again.  Ridiculous amateurs!"}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant and will definitely return to try a few different dishes.  We went there at 8am on a Sunday morning and it was empty.  The restaurant is very clean and the service was great.   I ordered the chicken & waffles, kids ordered pancakes and spouse ordered the usual...all very delicious.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Just finished having some Canadian brunch . Very tasteful , I loved it . :)  I'm one happy American hahaha .  Very clean place with good service . I def recommend it !"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! Great food, atmosphere and though there are only a handful of breakfast options, they have your staples as well as some cool 'international' twists on different dishes.   Their service is also awesome. Our server remembered I said it was my fathers birthday and surprised him with a cake and candle without us asking! Might I add that the cake had very pretty presentation, which shows the chef's expertise and creativity - something I can appreciate   Can't wait to be back here again!"}
{"text":"eh-okay . came a loooooong way to try this place. Found reviews in Yelp made me hungry and excited to try this place. It was a flop . The setting was nice and cozy (tiny but cozy) ambience was great but the food just didn't make \"it\" for me. I had so high expectations from this place, the menu sounded like it was great. Unfortunately this time, words were just words. They don't accept reservations so your better off be broken into groups if you desire to eat soon. Service was slow. Some servers were actually quite snobby (may be she was the owner) I had the Flip Side, the hubby had steak and eggs, son had the waffles - none of the above had the right season. I think they can definitely improve on taste and turn things around. Caution : Long wait Ahead. (came on a Saturday of a long weekend)"}
{"text":"Great European-like space for breakfast! Loved their waffle with fruits and omeletes. Very cute and tasty! Great find on the go."}
{"text":"2.5/3 overall rating..The furniture looks like something out of an ikea magazine..although the vibe in here they're going for is great. The menu has a bit if everything and priced quite well.   We came here on a Sunday afternoon. Waited over 30mins for a table as the waiters left plenty unclean , until a few ppl waiting complained . Once we were seated I had to ask for water twice, many who eere srated aftr us had drinks way before. The waiter kept walking by saying your food is on the way (we didn't ask). Although it wasn't we waited quite some, which we didn't mind since everything going us made fresh to order.  When the food arrived it was my partners , I still had to wait a bit longer for mine. Which was a bit awkward. They forgot my side order of baked beans, which was a bit annoying. I ordered the CHILAQUILES RANCHEROS, which was just ok to be honest. The poached eggs were done perfectly, the tortilla and veggies were really soggy , lastly the home fries were ok. I also got a few chips w them which were nice for dipping   My partner got chicken and waffles. He felt the waffles weren't crispy enough and the jalapeño flavour was a bit too much . After we received our food we still had to flag down the waiter for cutlery and syrup.   Experience and food was ok but definitely not worth the wait..prices are fair but based on everything as a whole won't be returning ."}
{"text":"This was our first time at Kravingz. I saw a review from a fellow Yelp Elite (Melissa M.) and what she wrote definitely made me want to visit.  We waited about ten minutes for our table (arrived close to noon on Sunday), but we had 3 different people come over to tell us how long it would be.  Our first impression was that the servers were extremely friendly and attentive and the place looked very clean and bright. The meals on the diners' plates made my mouth water. Everything looked amazing!  Immediately after we were seated, we were approached by a waitress for our drinks order which arrived within a few minutes.  It probably took around 15 minutes for our food to arrive. It was piping hot and looked lovely.   We ordered two dishes and shared them. The first dish we tried was The Islander which is jerk corned beef hash on top of cheddar grits and topped with two poached eggs. I questioned the idea of making the hash jerk-style but it definitely worked. It was really delicious. The grits were cheesy and had a few corn kernels in them for texture.  The second dish we tried was The Polski Benedict which is a potato pancake topped with smoked salmon (there's a peameal bacon option if you don't want salmon) with two Hollandaise covered poached eggs sitting on top. This was also really delicious. The Hollandaise was perfectly tangy and creamy.   The poached eggs on both dishes were done to perfection with a firm white and runny centre.  We will definitely be returning soon to try some more dishes."}
{"text":"We were looking for somewhere different for breakfast and came across the reviews for Kravingz. They were all raves!  Love the cozy little breakfast spot as it has a very inviting and casual feel. All of the equipment and furniture is straight from IKEA, so it feels like you are eating at home or at a friends place. Nothing super fancy here.  What I loved was the varied menu with exciting things to try. My bf got the Flip Side and I got the Chilaquiles. I loved the flavours in the dish, both tangy and salty. Came with a side of chips and potatoes. Can't beat the carb options!  We found both to be delicious and appropriately sized. Usually, we love the big gorge breakfasts. For the value as you're full for most of the day. These breakfasts could seem a bit on the smaller side in comparison, but more then enough to be full.  Service was warm and attentive. The male servers had some wicked button down shirts on, very fashionable yet down to earth. Making the place even more warm feeling.   Another plus, bathroom was clean!"}
{"text":"How did I not know this place was here? I'm a big fan. My friend and I found it randomly on Yelp and ended up planning to meet here for brunch with a group of friends. The restaurant is a bit small, so even with calling ahead, there was a bit of a wait for four people. It doesn't help that some people who finished still stuck around for a while after (like 30-45 min!) just chatting. I guess it's nice that you don't feel rushed to leave, but it wasn't great to wait when you can clearly see that some patrons were long finished. Anyway, the food offerings all looked so good that it was difficult to choose. Lots of traditional breakfast choices, as well as some that looked like filipino fusion. I split the pancakes and waffle with my friend and both dishes were really good. The staff was super friendly, though perhaps could have been more attentive. Parking lot is somewhat small, but I think there's another one in the next plaza over that you can use as well, and it's a short walk over. Can't wait to go back and try something different!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem in Mississauga! I absolutely love this place for a low key weekend brunch. I usually get the chicken and waffles which is one of their specialities. I would definitely recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast.  Friendly service.  Food was a mix of Filipino and American style.  Excellent flavors.  Cute space.  All fresh made food.  As good as it gets..."}
{"text":"Tried this place today and was extremely disappointed.  Walking in I thought i made the right choice trying a new place but went downhill quick when food arrived . I ordered the breakfast called the usual and asked for the sasauge and bacon to be well done. They were both cooked but barely.  The bacon was cold the home fries were soft and mushy.  The fruit on my plate was half a strawberry paper thin slice of orange and honeydew . You are supposed to get 3 eggs with breakfast and serving was tiny.  I can get more scrambled eggs from one egg at home . I told  the server is this 3 eggs she says yes and when I said I don't think so she said yeah that's small and offered to get me a side of eggs . I expressed my disappointment in the meal from the cold bacon the undercooked sasauge and tiny eggs and was told have a nice day .  I love going out for a nice brunch with the family but this place dropped the ball big time ."}
{"text":"--- Food --- I ordered the salmon egg benny. Around $15.  It was decent - Egg benny with hollandaise sauce with salmon and hashbrown below. There wasn't english muffin paired with it - which I was hoping for. But it was interesting trying something different. The smoked salmon was quite salty though, I drank a lot of water after. I think I would try other things on their menu next time - lots of interesting things! My friend got the fried chicken and waffles and seemed to have enjoyed it.   --- Atmosphere --- It was nice to find lots of places to park in the parking lot! No need to parallel park on the street. We arrived at 10:30am which was perfect - half of the restaurant was filled. Around 12pm - it was pretty much all filled out - so get there early if you don't want to wait. It was nice that the staff didn't rush us even after we finished and paid for our meal.   Our waitress was very friendly.  Great service.   --- Overall ---  It is a nice little place to come for brunch with a friend or date. :)"}
{"text":"We came across Kravingz in a Yelp search after going to a popular brunch spot in Mississauga and encountering a 25 person lineup. We ended up pretty happy for coming here instead of waiting in line.   Kravingz had a very friendly staff who took the time to explain the menu and accommodate any requests. The menu had many interesting options aside from the typical breakfast/brunch dishes you usually come across and that was great. The interior was nice and clean and cozy and there was minimal wait time to be seated.  I tried the flip side as well as the chicken and waffles and both were delicious. I Would definitely visit again despite the long drive."}
{"text":"Excellent food, friendly staff but terribly inefficient service.  Months ago i hoped this was just growing pains of a new restaurant, but unfortunately the service has not improved.  I'm glad to see that they are very busy, but given the service it will be a while before I come back."}
{"text":"Cute, little restaurant located in Clarkson, South Mississauga. The hostess was very friendly and welcoming. Loved the decor. Went with my husband for breakfast.  Although, there was a bit of a wait for our food, it was worth it. I had the Islander, which was jerk hash, cheddar and corn grits, and two poached eggs. It was amazing. Full of flavour and very well presented. My husband had The Usual which was a classic breakfast with three eggs, (over medium, which were done perfectly), bacon and sausage with your choice of toast. I will definitely be coming back to this trendy little spot!!"}
{"text":"For a local brunch place, they don't take reservations. We waited over 30 minutes for a table away from the door which is great. The cold wind can ruin the atmosphere. The cozy restaurant is well decorated and the turquoise paint colour is a pop from the rest of the restaurant. There are two televisions mounted on the walls.   The waitress had to apologize since she forgot my drink. In ordered the veggie burger with home fries. The patty was deep fried which I didn't expect it so it wasn't as healthy as I wanted to be. The home fries were dusted with spices and it was hot (in temperature).  My partner had the egg benediction with smoked salmon and he liked it. However, he told me he had it better at another restaurant.   Due to the wait, we were hungry so we ate and left. Also they were extremely busy and people were still waiting past 1:30 pm.   The washroom was spacious and clean.   Verdict: I would go back to try their other dishes, but show up early or on weekdays only."}
{"text":"Good food. Good atmosphere. Really nice staff and clean. We ordered the Polska eggs benedict and the island breakfast.  Both very tasty! Great hollandaise sauce!"}
{"text":"Really good food, and super homey! I love coming here for breakfast. The place is a bit small so not really ideal for strollers,  but worth the wait"}
{"text":"Was super excited for this place, but it just didn't live up to the hype for me. I called ahead, as I saw someone on here suggested placing your name down over the phone, only to be told you can't actually do that, so then we just ended up driving there and doing it in person. It was pretty busy, but the waitress told us it would only be about a five minute wait, so we just waited inside the restaurant. The decor is super cute and the place feels very clean and homey, so the vibe of this place is super welcoming and friendly!   After we were seated, we got the menus, and it was definitely really nice to see some twists on traditional brunch foods - loved the idea of The Polski Benedict (which is what I ended up getting) and Chilaquiles Rancheros sounded really good as well - but keep in mind it is a little pricey for what you end up getting. I got the Polski Benedict with tomato, and I finished that easily and was surprised for the price and the size that it didn't come with any sides. Everyone else at my table had the same issue, and we ended up going to Tim Hortons after breakfast!   Lastly - all of our drinks were AMAZING! I got a mimosa, which was super good, and someone at my table got the hot chocolate, which they said was the best hot chocolate they ever had. I definitely still enjoyed my meal, and I probably would go back, but only if I was willing to pay a little extra money that day."}
{"text":"I was slightly disappointed when paying a visit to Kravingz. I had heard so much hype over it and the aesthetic looked gorgeous. However, the food wasn't as amazing as I'd hoped. Although, it wasn't bad either. I had the fish tacos and they were lacking in flavour, also the limes I was served on the side were completely dry. They have great Pandesal though, I'd definitely recommend that. Do not get the green smoothie, that one is hard to get down..."}
{"text":"Hands down, the Best Chicken and waffles I've ever had!!!  Crispy and crunchy on the outside and juicy and soft on the inside. The bacon infused waffle is to die for!!!!!!!!   I'm definitely coming back! The Tacos was amazing too! (The soft taco shell was alittle stale tho)   Overall great experience. I would suggest calling ahead of time and put yourself on the list as it gets super busy for brunch"}
{"text":"Kravingz is amazing! The food is innovative, fresh and delicious, the staff is awesome, and the ambiance is great. So pumped that they are open in the evenings now!!!"}
{"text":"This place feels like a hidden gem. It is very well decorated and has a bit of an old diner feeling but with a modern twist. TVs playing cooking shows and a general clean feel from the white accents throughout. The food came hot and ready. Presentation was great and taste was delicious. Service was awesome. Tried the Tacos Locos (fish) and they were delicious (I think I've said delicious twice...). Paired with a coconut-squash-ginger soup  of the day, it was simply great.  I did, however, ask for a long double espresso to get me through the day but got a short one, but it was still deliciously paired with a wafer cookie.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Recommended on Insauga so i thought I'd give it a try. My girlfriend and i were not disappointed. Really bright and fresh decor offering a small but varied menu. Pricing is reasonable for the quality and portion size. I ordered The Islander, great presentation and amazing flavors. Would definitely order this again. Our server was polite and quick to fill up our coffees. We arrived at 10am and it was quiet, within 30 minutes there was a line-up. I would recommend you get there early especially if you are in groups of 3 or more."}
{"text":"Nice little eatery but small portion for the prices. All the breakfast places we go to, I never finish the dish. Had the eggs benny here and I was still hungry after. It is small. Did not come with any sides. No fruits or fries. Just a mash onion and potato as the base instead of bread. 14$ for an eggs benny is normal but they usually come with sides. It was just okay. Nothing to remember by."}
{"text":"The service is quite slow and the line to get a table is long. however the food is really good and the mimosa is great but I would pass on the hot beverages and any alcoholic beverage that isn't he mimosa since the rest of them just taste like sugar water. Definitely recommend the waffle, chicken and waffles, tacos, and home fries."}
{"text":"My boyfriend choosed this place for my birthday. It was such a nice experience! I grew up in Europe, so when I came I already knew this spot is gonna be my Go-To! The modern set up made me very comfortable. The service was nice and helpful!  We tried Chicken N' Waffles ( very crunchy ) Peace Love N' Granola ( not that sweet and fresh fruit )  and The Polski Benedict ( no words needed )."}
{"text":"Superb Chicken & Waffles, Good Benedict and surprisingly good Bloody Caesar. But the bill was a bit shocking.. too, However it's one of the best brunch to hangout with friends and loved ones."}
