{"text":"Seems to be run by a father and son team who never seem to be interested in serving the customer.  This is the 3rd time I have been here and I only came back here because I REALLY wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt.

Food - Was way over cooked and tasted like rubber..how can you screw up a turkey burger.  They even managed to burn the fries....the toppings were barely there...I got one piece of onion..a very small piece of lettuce...and a small tomato..they decided to skip on everything else I asked for even though it was printed on the receipt. 

Service....ummm there really was none.  The guy behind the counter didn't seem as if he wanted to take my order...I felt like I was taking him away from standing behind the counter.

I would never come back again. Save your hard earned money and go somewhere else, anywhere else."}
{"text":"Decent burger, albeit overpriced. The owner/cashier...poor customer service, asked him a simple question and I got a speed-talking mumble of an answer.

Dude, if you're reading this, find your true passion in life and go for it, being miserable will lead to many more regrets later in life. Even though you're older, going back to school might be a good option for you.  Good luck!"}
{"text":"These guys somehow can't get my orders right.  You ask for certain ingredients on a burger... it's written on the receipt and some how they still manage not to give you what you asked and paid for.   It happened on numerous occasions.  Very annoying and they don't seem to care either."}
{"text":"Rude service here. I went to buy a burger and she wouldn't let me because she said I was not Listening to her???"}
{"text":"Although the price to this burger in terms of a sort of fast food restaurant is really pricy that does not take away from how great this food is and how great the service is. The beef is cooked just right and the seasoning is just right. To be producing as good of a burger they do and as many it really is hard but somehow they manage to do it just right and for that they really have the recipe down."}
{"text":"This is am average place to get your burger and fries. I have been here twice and both times it was a bit of a wait but at least I know my food will be served hot. I do find that it is a bit pricey. You ate paying the same if not more than you would at a sit down dine in restaurant. My poutine was really delicious not saugy. I ordered a chicken burger as well which was a little hard to eat because the patty itself was falling apart inside the bun"}
{"text":"The food itself is great - can't complain there.

The cashier though! He didn't greet In the nicest way, and when he took my order, he really did not seem as though he wanted to be there- nor did he look happy to even take my hard earned money. Just kind of - blah expression - maybe a hard day at work- maybe personal issues, but he was definitely not someone you want to represent your store front.

{"text":"Excellent burgers fresh toppings.The owner is very friendly and easy to talk to nice clean restaurant easy to get WiFi going in there the service is fast and courteous,also has a great menu air conditioned for those hot days great place to go cool off"}
{"text":"The angus burger with a fried egg and or avocado is great if you are feeling like a champ or need some serious post work out gains. Either way, be prepared to pay up $12-15 for the full meal. Definitely worth spoiling yourself once in a while though."}
{"text":"Should have read the yelp rating before I visited. Disappointing burger today, I never eat at Hero but thought I would give it a try. The patty was reasonable, cooked well and decent seasoning. Toppings were fresh. The bun was a disaster, dry and fell apart while I was eating it, a total mess. Not sure why franchisees try to cut corners and serve outdated product. Never again."}
{"text":"The place was empty literally, but I was hungry and this was the closest place to chow, I've had much better burgers from The Hero Burger Franchise.  I asked for ketchup and mustard on both my burgers, not the case, and the bread was hard, won't be returning friends"}
