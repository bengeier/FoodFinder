{"text":"I love Ethiopian food and have been to Ethiopian restaurants in Houston, San Francisco and Cape Town. And I must say this little place is on par - if not better - with the best of them. The injera (bread) was super fresh and soft, the curry was delightfully spicy. If this is your first time in an Ethiopian restaurant, make sure you order a dish which comes with injera.  The decor was tasteful and the service prompt and pleasant. Overall a definite 5+."}
{"text":"My husband and I visits Ethiopian restaurants when we travel, and we have been to a bunch of them over the years. This place has thicker injera bread. Everything on the plate is very tasty. They even have live music on Saturday night. It takes a while for them to put the food together, I noticed the musician waited for us to have our food before he sits down to eat, he seems very thoughtful. The bathrooms are very clean, this is a rare find. I would say of all the cities and states we visited, this place is my favorite! The dinner veggie combo comes to about US$13.50. It's a little pricey but it's worth it."}
{"text":"We just finished a wonderful meal here. We each had a vegetarian combo platter, which had seven different kinds of stews and vegetables. The flavours were varied and went so well with the injera bread.  The interior of the restaurant is as beautiful and warm as the service. The coffee is a must! Great value for money and lots of parking nearby.   Looking forward to our next visit here! What a hidden gem on International Avenue!"}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to drive to Forest Lawn for some good ethnic food and came upon this place. There were no reviews online but we decided to try it anyway.   The service was prompt and friendly. We ordered the Yebeg Qey Tibs and Kitfo Special.  They both came on fresh Injera bread. The Kitfo was great, but the Yebeg was truly amazing.  Super tender lamb, rich flavourful sauce, it was perfection! They asked about spice level, we both love spicy, and for the first time we asked for spicy and it was right on - not an overwhelming spice where all you could taste/feel is heat, the heat expertly complimented the spices used.   The ambiance is also really nice, welcoming and perfectly suited to the meal.  You can tell that our server/hosts truly believe in their food because how could you not?!  We would come back here in a heart beat! You should come too!"}
{"text":"Highly underrated for what it offers. great place for ethnic food. Most of the food is fresh in general. Servers are excellent and dont mind going extra mile to provide customer service"}
{"text":"Not good. Everything was cold and the bread was straight out of the fridge. Wanted to love it but I didn't. We went at lunch, maybe it's better at dinner time."}
{"text":"I came to Ensira for a New Year's Eve dinner and was surprised to find the place serving a few full tables at 9pm on this celebratory day--it shows that people will come here even on a day where it's excusable to have an 8 course meal--I'm assuming this is a relatively popular local restaurant.   My companion and I (always) order the vegetarian platter, which was $18. We asked the owner/manager if it's $18/person (a popular way Ethiopian restaurants seem to charge for their dishes) and he said it's meant to fill one person, but we may as well order 1 and see if we would be full. We were not. The platter is enough for 1.5 people(person?). The owner noticed we were not quite \"satisfied\" and when my friend asked if we could get another bowl of the sides, the owner gave it to us on the house. Now this is how you do business!! With the extra side, I had a very satisfactory and filling meal. So (you know what I'm going to say next), the service here was exceptional, including the waiter and waitress.  Food wise, the injera (which is gluten free) was very delicious in terms of flavour and texture. Also no upset stomach yay! The sides were not oily but was not as flavourful as I would have liked. Their best side in the veggie platter was probably their beets and this one side (that I cannot figure out what it is from the taste/appearance) that leaves a bitter after taste but is quite flavourful. The other sides were meh--again, not enough flavour.  Overall, food is a 3.5 (especially for the high price point), but the generosity of the owner and service from the wait staff moves them up to a 4."}
{"text":"My sister brought me here for an ethnic inspired supper. At first I was a little apprehensive, but when the meal came...OMG! It was so delicious. Not to mention that is the first restaurant experience I have had eating with nothing but your fingers."}
