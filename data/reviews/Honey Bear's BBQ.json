{"text":"Was not a fan. The service was horrible, pork was chewy and they were out of mac n cheese. The only good thing was they had Big Red on the fountain. I will not return."}
{"text":"Went here Saturday after a long absence and was reminded why there has been such a long absence.  The food was mediocre and the facility is pretty run down. 
I had the BBQ Pork, coleslaw and peach cobbler while my wife had the BBQ Pork and potato salad. We both thought the BBQ pork was a 3 or 4 on a scale of 1 to 10 and the coleslaw and potato salad were no better.  I was so looking forward to the peach cobbler but even it wasn't very good.   If you're in the area and want good BBQ go two minutes away to Hap's BBQ on Washington and 48th.  Of course Joe's BBQ in Gilbert is great too and even Famous Dave's kicks this place."}
{"text":"I heard through the grapevine (and Yelp) that Honey Bear's BBQ was a great place to go for authentic BBQ in the area, so I took some friends from Italy to try their first BBQ and we were not disappointed. The amount of meat on the ribs was the most I've ever seen, so they clearly have a great butcher connection. The sauce was not too heavy nor sweet nor spicy, the coleslaw was perfect and the corn was extremely soft. My rib meat was not falling off the bone, but it was tender.  We'll definitely be back!

There's plenty of room for wheelchair/powerchairs, though the gravely parking lot is a bit awkward."}
{"text":"Came doe pork and they are out ? Really what kind of business is this, and the prices are absurd and they are out of pork ? You would think wit the absurd prices they charging they would have enough pork in stock .  All bad."}
{"text":"Third times a charm and don't plan on coming back. The counter help was extremely rude. The 1/4 I had looked like it came from the grocery store and drizzled with sauce. All 3 times that I have been here haves been the same. Rude staff and poor quality at the central avenue location pretty much decided that I will not return."}
{"text":"Please don't let this location turn you off Honeybear's!! The original one is sooooooo much better! I dont know what it is with the tempe location but I'm telling you after growing up in Queen Creek (and my parents would still drive all the way to Van Buren to get this amazing bbq) I've lived in North Carolina, Tennessee and Nor-Cal and I've still never had better bbq than the Van Buren location. DONT GO TO THIS ONE it sucks... the service, the food... it all sucks."}
{"text":"I love the potato salad! It's so good! The BBQ sandwiches are good, but sometimes I do question dropping 10 bucks for lunch here. BBQ sandwiches aren't that big and to be honest if it wasn't for the great potato salad, I would think this place is a rip-off."}
{"text":"Coming from NE Ohio Honeybear's BBQ sauce tastes just like my grandma's recipe. None of this ketchup and sugar Texas crap. It's tangy, it burns a tiny bit and it tastes like BBQ sauce should!

The pork sandwich is always piled high and an excellent cut of meat and mounds of french fries, that are always good too!"}
{"text":"Good, not great.  I don't really know how else to describe Honey Bear's.  If you are craving BBQ and are in Central Phoenix, I say stop by.  Expect your sandwich to have a little too much sauce and service to fall slightly below your expectations.  I've been a few times before, and I'll be back a few times more, but you're more likely to find me at Stacey's."}
{"text":"I quote my fellow Yelper, \"Come on guys.  You can do better than this.\"   

We showed up around 6pm with Groupon in hand, and I was glad we'd planned to get our dinner to go (not a real appetizing place to relax/dine). 

My husband and I had ribs which tasted like they had been cooked several hours ago and then reheated in a microwave. They lack anything resembling flavor. We had a side of coleslaw and even that tasted awful (how do you mess up coleslaw?!). 

There are some mighty fine sauced BBQ joints in the Phoenix area - This ain't one of them. And the price! $19 for a rack of less than mediocre ribs! (I was so glad I had a Groupon and didn't pay full price.)

On a side note: if anyone knows of a great dry-rib pork BBQ joint in Phx PLEASE tell me! I haven't had them since we passed thru a small town in Texas almost 2 years ago and I'm craving them like crazy!"}
{"text":"Everything here is good. I love the barbeque sauce and the peach cobbler is to die for!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE catfish taste like crunchy cardboard. HORRIBLE customer service in the van buran location. If you want some really good catfish papa joes is AWESOME!!! It's actually worst than one star, and they BOIL there ribs. SMH!!"}
{"text":"I wanted to order chicken and ribs but I was told they don't sell it like that and would have to order 2 separate plates lol okay then."}
{"text":"We were starving and headed downtown for a concert and decided that BBQ ribs sounded great. I remembered that I had a an old groupon that I had bought so we decided to try it. When we first walked in it did seem a little ghetto but I know sometimes smaller places are better. We ordered a full slab Of pork ribs and 2 drinks. It came with 2 sides an with tax was about $30. My groupon was for $20 but was expired so I thought I would only get the amount I paid, $10. The only positive thing about our experience was that they honored my groupon for the full $20.

The cashier was not polite at all, not wanting to even take my groupon at first. You could tell he didn't want to be working.  Another employee was sitting in plain sight eating a large plate with no manners and looking gross. I went to get some lemonade and it tasted like water so I dumped it out and got root beer. About 10 min after we sat down they called our number but only to say that they were out of ribs! The place had 2 customers on a Friday night and the special was rib tips..but they only had chicken! They offered an extra side but no change in the price... Then while we were eating I heard another customer who had come in long after us, being old that they were out of ribs and the customer was upset that he had already paid for ribs too! I don't understand why they were letting people order and pay for ribs when it was clear they knew that they knew they didn't have any! 

When we got our meal my husband took one bite and said he hated it. the chicken was dry, bbq sauce tasted like metal and the red potato salad seemed like the kind you get in bulk at a grocery store. The fries   Were ok so thats all he ate. I liked the bbq sauce but the chicken was super dry. our friend ordered a chicken sandwich an the bun fell apart as she picked it up. She took one bite and said it was gross and didn't eat any more of it. 

If we had to pay full price I would have made a big scene but because it was a groupon and were just trying a new place I let it go but we will never go again."}
{"text":"Pick this place out of a hat while seeing a friend near by. Some of the best BBQ I have ever had!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ I have had! I have been to their other location and said the same thing. I don't know why they don't have 5 stars"}
{"text":"I don't really know why but i expected to not quite enjoy Honey Bear's BBQ. Most of that is because when i think of BBQ anything i don't think of buying it more someone outside cooking it for me. Yet when i went in I can say I enjoyed. I ate the shredded chicken sandwich and was super happy with it. Though not a go to place if i get the craving I will pop back in again."}
{"text":"I've not had the best q here but starving, nearby I stopped in. Went in for sliced lean brisket. I got a cup of shredded dried out brisket. I got my money refunded and walked out That was my final visit. Zero stars"}
{"text":"I used to love Honey Bears, but in the past 24 months, for some reason, they've lost their soul. 

And that's bad because this was the only reliable selection of BBQ in Arizona.

Whatever they changed, and I'm not sure it's quantifiable, but it needs to change back.

Whenever I'd fly into the PHX airport around dinnertime, I'd bring home some Honeybear's for me and the wife.  The last few times, it's just been kind of \"meh\".  

I'm not quite sure what it is, but I need to find a new guilty pleasure, smothered in BBQ sauce."}
{"text":"I was a Honey Bears fan for 20 years.  No more.  Will never visit again.

Stopped off at the Central Ave. location after a Sunday D'bax game.  Not that crowded.  Ordered, paid, and waited.  And waited.  Noticed most other customers were waiting too.  They finally brought out an order - #131 - I had #143.  Another 10 minutes before #132 came out.  People started coming up to the counter wondering what was going on.  The cashier was dismissive - no explanation, no apology, nothing.

50 (50!) minutes later my order finally arrived.  I didn't bother to complain knowing YELP is my best revenge.

Maybe there was a managment change, but Honey Bears will never see me again."}
{"text":"Somewhere, beneath layers of flacid, white skin, I am a black man.   Though I cannot readily identify with years of oppression, white women crossing the street when I pass for no good reason and the spectre of slavery, I think that my love of motown, broad-hipped women and soul food makes me, at the least, an honorary brother.   

Strangely, and perhaps because of hunger, the best BBQ pork sandwich I ever had was dolled out to me as I hurriedly boarded a plane in Nasville, TN.   I've dined all across America and even in Memphis itself and I've tasted some fine BBQ and contrary to other reviewers here, I thought HB BBQ was a-ok.   

I was feeling depressed last night, the unfortunate consequence of some protracted litigation I'm involved in and I got a hankering for slow-cooked meat slathered in tangy bbq sauce and my craving guided the wheel as I drove to HB's.    

It still looks like an IHOP.  They've changed the booths and moved some things around, but the decor has a definite \"International House of Barbeque\" feel to it.   I must also admit that I was more than a little dismayed when 3 hispanic guys made my bbq pork sandwich.  What in all the red tamales do hispanic folks know about BBQ?  Call me picky, but when I get something called Honey Bear BBQ with a song of the south lookin bear on the sign, I expect a large black man or woman with a disarming smile to sling my pork and slaw together on a paper plate--the way god intended.   Perhaps I'm missing out on all the great latin BBQ, but I've long believed that after all the suffering God forced upon my brothers, he tried to make penance by imbuing them with rhythm, soul and bbq knowledge.

Nonetheless, the sandwich was tasty.  I would have liked a spicy sauce option, but I'll take what I can get.  It's not deep south bbq and it's probably not even like Mom's, even if your mom was irish and grew up in poughkipsie, but it's at least pretty tasty and reasonably priced.  It's Phoenixand 50 degrees in the dead of winter.  We take what we can get."}
{"text":"A Phoenix classic. I grew up on a Honey Bear BBQ sandwich, and even though I've lived in California for 8 years I try to always grab one when I'm in town. The sauce... the sauce is amazing. And they keep it out and warm. Too many bbq places think it's ok to serve cold bbq sauce. No thanks. Should be just as hot as the food! The fries here are also great and have a seasoning on them that really makes them kick. Sure the location is a bit older and no one is excited to drink RC cola... but this place is a Staple for a good BBQ sandwich."}
{"text":"I am visiting from out of state and went here based only on Siri listing it when I asked for a BBQ restaurant. Btw, plenty of parking. When I entered, a pleasant gentleman was wiping tables and he greeted me with a smile and a pleasantness that clearly was natural. He helped me get a take-out menu and suggested several choices. A young man working there was also quite pleasant and I never saw anyone on their cell phone like I have so many times in other restaurants. My food came quickly, was hot, the order was correct, and most importantly, tasted delicious. I am glad I stopped there."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place because the food is pretty good and they have vintage soda brands, but they make it pretty tough. My two biggest issues are the price and the employees. If you want a sandwich, side, and a drink you will be paying $12-$15. It's not a \"sit-down\" restaurant, and the prices are absurd for the portion size and quality that you get. It's not that it isn't good- it's that it is not worth the price. Problem #2 is the staff- they make you feel like you are inconveniencing them by placing your order and giving them money. I think I asked about what came on a sandwich and I received a long sigh and one finger pointed up to the menu, but the menu doesn't tell you...that's why people ask questions. I don't need a deep conversation or anything, but respect the people the are keeping you in business.There is better BBQ in the valley at a much better price, this place is popular because of its location."}
{"text":"This is some good stuff.  Ordered the slider meal - which allowed me to sample the chicken, pork and beef BBQ for roughly 10 bucks.  I asked for some hot BBQ sauce on the side (they did not have it out on the tables) and went to town on this meal.  The meal was enough to make me satisfied without feeling like I ate too much.  The BBQ sauce on the sliders was more than sufficient but I am one of those guys that likes to douse their meat in BBQ sauce (otherwise it just does not feel right) .   Honey Bears was bare bones in decor but for a BBQ place, I am not judging on the quality of their pictures on the wall but rather the tastiness of the meat.  I would come back to this place in a heartbeat!  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Best BBQ, hands down.  I go out of my way to get Honey Bear's!   Everything is SOO good.  My only complaint is that I wish they had corn bread!"}
{"text":"My favorite BBQ joint in phoenix.  I get the beef brisket every time.  FANTASTIC"}
{"text":"This place has great BBQ, and the sides are great too. The wife and I come here just to eat sometimes all the way from Gilbert.  It's a 25 min drive, but it's worth it. The workers are nice too. Clean place. I highly recommend for good BBQ!"}
{"text":"This was my first time to this place and probably the last! When you walk in to any service business you expect a certain amount of kindness and professionalism. Well not here. we were met with a rude cashier who kept screaming NEXT as if there was no one in line. Next I saw all these signs telling you what you can't do in this place like do not dump anything in the soda dispenser drain and check your order before you leave and so on. Finally when we were able to place a order the extremely rude cashier seemed so irritated that we actually had the nerve to enter this place that she had no desire to even take our order or answer any questions that we had. The price was decent but on the expensive side, 20 dollars for 2 people without drinks. So we finally get our order and knowing that i have to check my bag because i read the sign that had it printed in BOLD letters, I noticed that I was missing my potato salad. So the rude cashier looks over and says WHAT. And I said I'm missing my potato salad so she opens the cooler and basically throws it at me with very good accuracy as if she has done this many times. So then my brother asked her if she missed his potato salad also and she screams out I DON'T KNOW CHECK YOUR BAG, As if she has somehow forgotten what she put in there 30 seconds ago. 

Bottom line food is good but it's not worth the effort you have to go through to get it. The staff is so bad that I will go out of my way to go somewhere else. The owners should be aware that the service of this place has gotten to the point that people won't even go there so they don't have to deal with the worst service they have ever had. In todays economy where people are choosing carefully where to spend their money you need to have something special and this place should put up a big sign that says:

GO AWAY WE DON'T WANT YOUR MONEY!!!!!

They will never get anymore of mine."}
{"text":"So I will be the first to admit that I am not usually a big barbeque fan.  A few years ago I was in Kansas City and even then I was \"Meh\" about the whole thing.  Maybe my palate has expanded since then- who knows.  Either way, when I had a hankering for barbeque today it was a little unexpected to say the least.  

To be fair, I had been meaning to try Honey Bears since I moved close to it.  I had heard how amazing it was, but just had never really been in the mood.  Today I gave in and went and I am so glad I did!

The service was nice and super fast.  I was really surprised by how quickly my food came out.  I ordered the 3 sliders, figuring I would have an assortment of tastes in case I picked the wrong thing.  All three were really good, but the pork slider was absolutely my favorite.  I don't normally like barbeque sauce, because it usually seems too sweet to me.  It seemed to me like there might be a little bit of a kick thrown in that kept it from being overly sweet.  The sauce paired with the tender juiciness of the pork was completely delectable.  Now I know what I will get when I get a barbeque craving (and this time it won't be a surprise!)"}
{"text":"I don't understand the fuzz about this place. 

BBQ was not impressing, the weekend special Catfish was Okay. Side dishes were always disappointing. Price is high for the quality of the food. 

I didn't hate it, but I would rather go somewhere else for BBQ."}
{"text":"Very good bbq (conisdering I have high expectations being from Chicago). Loved the sauce. Just wasn't happy with the hot links, expected better. Overall, l liked it, will definitely be back next trip."}
{"text":"I don't know how this place stays in business! The food is terribly overpriced,  the food is not good at all. I've eaten bbq all over the country this place is a joke. When you order the food  they make you tip 15%. I  had to give them was 5 dollars?  For what they don't have waiters? You wouldn't leave a tip for a mcdonalds or subway so why would they take more money from you!? This place had no air conditioner on so my husband and our children were sweating profusely.  The tables are filthy and unbalanced. People, don't waste your money it's not good food and overpriced!!!!"}
{"text":"Good bbq and simple clean restaurant. The staffs is helpful and friendly I will definitely be back. Loved the pork ribs,,, sweet potato tater tots..and slaw"}
{"text":"Customer service at this joint is bad, mgmt need to send their cashier serious customer service training pronto. When my husband and I went there couple of weeks ago we ordered the brisket sandwich only. Since I don't drink soda I just asked for cup for water. The spout for water and lemonade is one the same so when I pressed the dispenser for water some residual lemonade came out and then the water. Well that stupid cashier turn out to be watching me the whole time and he made a comment \"just water huh\". I was so upset by his comment that I walked to him and showed him my cup and insist that this is just water. He was so busy watching me that he brought out  french fries when we ordered sweet potato fries, and my husband ordered beer that he forgot to serve and we have to remind him.  Attention management make sure to hire personable cashier with good manners. You just lost  two more customers!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious Ribs and they have Big Red soda on fountain? what's not to love?!"}
{"text":"Decent value. Generous portions. Beef, pulled pork, cowboy beans and bbq sauce are good. Hot links not very good; more like a cheap hot dog. Potato salad disappointing. Nice staff who are willing to customize orders."}
{"text":"Came here Saturday for lunch at about 11:30 to find Honey Bear's BBQ nearly empty, but a friendly counter help ready to take our order. We had a brisket sandwich and sliders with sides of 'Cowbro Beans' and potato salad. The brisket and pork was really good and tender, but the chicken was dry and nothing special about the bread. I loved the pork and beans which had a unique sweet sauce that I've never tasted anything like before.  The potato salad was chunky and was good as any homemade."}
{"text":"I guess I should've read the reviews first. A coworker and I went here for lunch about a week ago. We both ordered the half catfish.  She got sweet potato fries and I just got regular fries. The fish had no flavor at all and it was way too crispy. It pretty much crumbled when I broke off a piece. The drink selection sucked and to top it off we both became sick later on that day!!! I will never eat here again. I should've known better when the light fixtures looked greasy with dust stuck to them."}
{"text":"We ordered take-out from HB's. It's  been awhile since we've had their food, because it has not been that great In the past few years. So we foolishly decided to try it again.

We brought the food home and the first thing we pulled out of the bag was a foil - wrapped 1/2 ear of corn, ALREADY EATEN. Very GROSS!!! Everyone one said there was no way they would eat that food!!!

We took the whole order back to HB. No apology, no nothin'. 

I am advising all to proceed with caution!

BTW, went to post this and they will not post unless I give a star rating. So giving a 1, but I would  like to make it a -10."}
{"text":"I'm on the hated-it scale of the Honey Bear love fest.  

We ordered the bbq ribs and a beef sandwich with cole slaw and cowbro beans on the side.  Thought the meal was on the below average scale for tastiness...the beef sandwich meat suffered from not being marinated, and it was bone dry...the bbq rib was more of the same...so this would have been a 2 star review...BUT what pushed it down to 1 star for me was that my ribs were \"bloody\"...No not pink, but actually bloody with the jelly-like texture of raw meat...great when I'm eating sushi, but not so much for bbq pork

I actually returned the bloody thing to the counter person who agreed that it was bloody and made me a new plate...unfortunately, it was a new plate of the same bloody ribs, I gave up and just trashed the bloody plate....so no, I won't be back for another try

If you're looking for tasty bbq sandwich...try TEXAZ for lunch...that's where I'd be the next time I have a craving"}
{"text":"Food was good but service was less than stellar. 
We came to the counter and clerk didn't acknowledge us, he just stood there. 
We ordered to eat in.  About 10 minutes went by and no food.  We looked up at the counter and the food had come out and was sitting up there- no attempt to call out that it was ready or, heaven forbid since we were the only table in the place, they would bring it out to us.

Another order came up and there was one other person in the place..they yelled out the order was ready this time. Woman was out of it and didn't go pick up the food. They called it out 2 more times..she was 5 feet away and the only person..they couldn't walk it out to her? Not impressed."}
{"text":"How does a BBQ place run out of pork at 2 pm on a Sunday?! We love Honey Bears, but we will never come to this location again."}
{"text":"What the hell is in the sauce? I swear it's like crack. The more you have the more you want it and leaves you in a coma like state. 

This is some seriously good bbq! The venue is not fancy at all just down to earth simple food in a cafeteria like setting."}
{"text":"Mmmm BBQ! What is in that sauce?

I love Honey Bear's. The food is always consistently yummy and the sauce WOW! Some of the locations don't offer the same menu but I'm willing to drive for my favorites.

I really like the fact you can just order a side of the meat and don't necessarily have to eat the bread. Works great for a take home meal and to use on top of salad."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday.  Ordered the pulled pork sandwich, side of beans and drink for me to eat there. Beans had chunks of what tasted like dehydrated dried onion in them and they were not hydrated. Sandwich bun was totally soggy and pork was dry. Ordered the 1/4 chicken meal with dark meat (does not like breast meat)  and drink for my husband to take with him because he wasn't hungry.  We sat down with my meal and ate, he had not gotten his meal yet.  About 20-25 min later, went to counter to get his meal and they didn't even have it ready!  Then they said, oh, is the white meat ok?  We don't have any of the dark meat ready right now?  After 25 minutes and they didn't have any ready? Husband reluctantly said ok.  Got home and later ate it and it was all dried out and appeared old.  We will not be going back, the customer service is terrible and so is their food these days. Spent $20.00 on a small amount and food and this is what we got. Try https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Barbecue-Company-Grill-Cafe/100123416554
The Barbecue Company instead.  Their food and customer service are both great. Honey Bear's you lost a customer. BBQ Company is only open Mon-Fri until 3:00pm but worth the visit.  Once a month they have a buffet!"}
{"text":"I payed $10.00 for a peace of dry old chicken, and bitter flat diet rc cola, good corn on the cob, and halfway decent cowbro beans. The people here were not very friendly, it was not a good experience to my standards, especially when spending $10.00. 

I could have just as easily went somewhere else for cheaper that was way better. Worst bbq I have ever had in my life. Horrible, I want my money back, I feel like I was robbed.

Screw you Honey Bears BBQ"}
{"text":"Sunday, Sept 3
Food-4 stars, everything else-1 star. 
Drove 300 miles to Phoenix, and another 40 minutes from Scottsdale, just to make sure we could hit Honey Bears. Ribs, pulled pork sandwich, Cole slaw, and fries were great. That was the good part. 
The bad: employees did not want to be there and it was reflected in their customer service. This place is living off its past. No toilet paper in the restroom, watered way down iced tea, soda machine with 4 choices with at least 2 of them not adjusted properly. They forgot my Mac and Cheese that I ordered and paid for. Had to remind them after we got the food.
Told the counter person that a car in the parking lot had its trunk open, counter person could care less. Only 2 tables of people in the place to ask about trunk, but he didn't bother. 
Will never go to this location again. Will try the Van Buren location next time in town and that will determine if I wipe Honey Bears off my must eat locations when visiting Phoenix."}
{"text":"This used to be the best BBQ establishment in town. 
Has gone way downhill: dirty, unkept, no pride of ownership, no customer service. 
Ordered a slab of ribs tonight and received 7-8 individual pieces in total that looked like garbage. Definitely not the beautiful \"slab\" I expected. 1/2 of the pieces were not edible.  Beans were served room temp. 104 degrees today and a/c wasn't cooling the dining room.  2 employees shouting from across the dining room at each other in Spanish over our heads. My last four or five visits have been equally horrible.  It just seems like there is nobody in the joint who cares. 
I will never go back nor recommend to others.  I'm so disappointed--used to be a legendary BBQ joint."}
{"text":"Last night was my 5th time eating at this restaurant in the 10 years that I've   been a resident of Arizona. I knew from the previous 4 times that I probably would NOT enjoy it. I. WAS. RIGHT. It's as though they simply boil the meat, take it out of the water and pour sauce on it...really basic sauce at that. The Mac and Cheese reminded me of Kraft's stove top Mac and Cheese.  Apparently they're doing something right for somebody to stay business for this many years. Hell even I came back knowing I wouldn't like it. Maybe subconsciously I remembered how much you get for your money. I'll be having the second half for lunch today."}
{"text":"Food was alright however besides the fact that they took too long to actually serve us our order. They always seem to run out of pork, not only that, the cashier was rude. They also ran out of plates. They also lack communication within each other I made a separate purchase and they called the same number three times. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Yumm-o!  I love this place!  We eat here a lot.  I always get the ribs... and mix it up between the potato salad and the cole slaw.  The only thing I don't really like is sometimes they put too much pepper or something in their potato salad and cole slaw.  I'm not sure what that flavor is, but when there is too much, it ruins it for me. 

But since I don't go there for potato salad and cole slaw, I'm pretty happy with the place, plus it's within walking distance from my apt."}
{"text":"First introduced because they were serving food at a charity event I attended. I really liked the BBQ sandwich and I liked that they give back to the community so I decided to try them for lunch one day.  It was delish...and, they have yummy fries which they hadn't served at the event.  Since then, I've been back in with the family and small groups and ordered their party platters/dishes for events at my house and everyone has loved the food.  The staff is always helpful. The place is always clean. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Hmmm...one of the best BBQ chains in town and this location has no reivews?  I'm a big fan of the Van Buren location and have only tried this location once...and got sick !!   I think it was the potato salad as it had a funny taste to it. I ended up not finishing the PS and just ate my sandwich.  Later that night it was not a pretty sight and I have not been back.  I do still visit the VB location all the time though...great BBQ."}
{"text":"First I love Honey Bears. Their BBQ is great. I have always had a great experience at Honey Bears. The owners are locals and are wonderful people, not some faceless chain.  

I am shocked at some of the statement some people post on Yelp. It sounds like some bitter competitors or someone with a grudge. These attacks are blatantly false. Just one example: to the \"customer\" who claimed that the BBQ didn't have enough sauce - if you had actually been in the restaurant you would know that they have large containers of their sauce so that you can get as much as you want. 

The food is great, the staff is friendly, the owners are great.  Go Honey Bears!"}
{"text":"I have lived in Phoenix for 20 years, have always heard good things about Honey Bears, and have meant to try their Q for a long time.  Greatly, greatly, disappointed!

I went there on a Saturday a little over one month ago.  I ordered a slab of ribs, beans, slaw, and sweet potato pie to go [wanted peach cobbler, but they were out].  I was really looking forward to some good ribs.  I arrived to pick-up my order and there was a line of three parties ahead of me at the cash register.  No big deal until the sassy young lady at the register spent 15 minutes talking and checking out the first person in line.  While I stood getting frustrated from waiting so long to just pick up food, the second and third parties in front of me left because they too were tired of waiting.  

When it was finally my turn, I mentioned to the young lady, \"do you realize that two parties in front of me walked out because they were tired of waiting\"?  When I said this, an older lady that appeared to be the manager stopped dead in her tracks as she was walking by.  She asked the young lady at the cash register what was going on.  The young lady stated that I told her two parties had just walked out because they were tired of waiting.  The manager said, \"oh\" and went on about her business like it was no big deal.  When I paid my bill, the young lady stated, \"your food is over there,\" pointing to the other end of the counter about 6 feet away.  I asked if there was extra sauce with my meal and she told me extra sauce is always included with ribs.  

I get home with my order and am ready to chow down on some ribs and the first thing I notice is there is no extra sauce with my meal as I was told.  I opened up the plate of ribs and was quite surprised when I took a bite.  I think these ribs may have been walked past the smoker at some point, but that is about all.  No smokey flavor, no smokey color, just a big disappointment.  The beans were very good, the slaw appeared to be a premade product, and the potato pie was o.k.  However, I really wanted the cobbler they had on the menu but were out of.  

I admit that I am a BBQ junkie and have high expectations of such food.  But I had heard such high reviews of Honey Bears and these ribs were so bad.  I honestly ate half of the slab and tossed the rest in the trash.  I paid ~$30 dollars for this single meal and was insulted by the treatment of their staff.  I will never walk through their door again..."}
{"text":"I have been back to this Honey Bear's location several times since my first review.  And the place has gotten significantly worse on each subsequent visit.  This last visit will definitely be my last.  The place does not look well maintained at all and the food was an utter disappointment.  I ordered my usual hot link sandwich and my other half ordered a pulled pork sandwich.  My hot link sandwich was so so sad.  And the pulled pork sandwich was not only smaller and on different bread but also lacking taste or flavor, and add to that it not tasty.  Of course, it gave him heartburn later to his dismay   Now I need to find myself another place to sate my hot link cravings!."}
{"text":"After taking several bites from the potato salad, I had a feeling that my stomach was just gonna burst. It was terrible! They didn't even have chicken available when we ate there. Definitely do not recommend."}
{"text":"Must have been an off day but still pretty good. Better luck next time!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ sandwich for a decent price. The side of beans are amazing,  as are the sweet potato fries! Definitely will be returning."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best!

Who is writing these reviews and giving this place high marks? You don't know barbeque that's for sure. What's good about slices of processed meat with barbeque sause poured on them? What's good about ribs that are boiled with more sauce dumped on them. Huge disappointment and way overpriced, $24 for two servings of meat and one drink! I can go to Dickey's barbeque and have a better meal than this place for 1/2 the price."}
{"text":"My family and I stepped inside and noticed the smoky meat aroma and saw the large crockpot full of sauce. We helped ourselves to a tiny cup and sampled it; we were sold (because even if the meat was blah, the sauce could make up for it)! The staff were very helpful and friendly. Yes, the sign outside says it's southern bbq. Yes, the people behind the counter spoke Spanish. No matter to us; they are not mutually exclusive. We sampled the beef brisket, pork and chicken. We decided on beef brisket and ribs. For sides we chose coleslaw, macaroni & cheese, bbq beans, a cornbread muffin, a slice of sweet potato pie and for the kiddo, a regular ol' hotdog and French fries. The meat came with plenty of sauce and everything else was great! We hung out while we waited for our food (about 15 min) and got our order to go. We would definitely visit here again!"}
{"text":"We stopped for take out ribs!  Don't be fooled by the outside of the building, there's lots of space inside, it's clean and well lit. We were greeted as we walked in the door, placed our order (using a Groupon Coupon too).  We waited for just enough time to purchase treats from the gumball machine in the front.

By the time we got home we could hardly wait to dig in.  With bibs in place we opened the huge plate of ribs, one full rack with two giant sides and two melt in your mouth dinner rolls.  Wow, the kids and I couldn't finish all the ribs.  The sides didn't stand a chance!

The ribs were pre-sauced and as we read on other reviews, not as zippy as we wanted, that was easily resolved with some Franks Red Hot Sauce.  The fries were crispy and seasoned nicely, not too much season salt and not over done.

They had other specials and a couple of TVs that would have made a nice stay, but we wanted to relax at home.  We really enjoyed the ribs and will make it a point to try the other items they offer!"}
{"text":"If you know good barbecue, you know Honey Bears isn't it.  They only give you one option for sauce, and it's really sweet and watery.  The potato salad is disgusting.  Try it if you dare.  There are better BBQ places in the area, so why go here?"}
{"text":"I know the main thing is BBQ but on Thursday evenings and all day Friday they have Catfish and it is great. At least half of my trips to Honey Bears is for the catfish. Try the BBQ and the catfish."}
{"text":"Slogan: \"you don't need no teeth to eat our meat\"...  Actually, yeah, you really do. I gotta respect honey bears for becoming somewhat of an icon in the valley, but the pulled pork leaves a little room for improvement. My opinion is that it's cooked at too high of a temp. (note to honeybear: aim for 225 degrees - get staff in earlier if necessary)  Too high temp results in not enough time in it's early cooking stages to absorb that smoke flavor, which is also evidenced by an absence of color.   Slower cook time will also take some of the bite out of the meat.  But hey, it seems to be selling, so why change?  Maybe they should change the slogan though.  It is tasty, but all of the pork sandwich's flavor comes from the sauce, which is pretty unique - give me 100 sauces and i guarantee i can pick out honeybears."}
{"text":"Been there a couple times in the past...Dont know what all the hype is...Went there yesterday 1/23/14..Cashier unpleasant to work with..She wasnt paying attention..
I find the menu a little over priced for the end result... I had the pork sandwich..it was very small..  The sauce was way way watered down (thin)... The mac and cheese was weak at best...ive had better Craft from the box...Im not a big fan of RC fountain drinks...(wtf is up with that ?)   When i went to put my tray away the garbage can was over filled with trash on the floor next to it..I balanced my tray on top and quietly left..Not a \"goodbye\" from the counter or a \"yall come back\"    nothing.... 
  What happend to this place ?  Did they change owners ?  I just dont get it...
                                                                                                          I dont think ill be back /"}
{"text":"Not sure where all that smoke is going but there's not much on the meat! I had the sliders one of each; no go:( All 3 meats dry and not much flavor. (Except when you add sauce) Not that great; but hey, maybe it's an off day for them."}
{"text":"Need better phone service attempted to place a call-in order but didn't get anyone to answer after calling 2-3 times, pathetic."}
{"text":"This place is close to the museum so we thought we'd give it a try.  YAY!  and  YUM!  The pulled pork was worth the drive from San Diego.  My sister from Alabama saw the peach cobbler on the menu and spoke with the cook who assured her it was fresh, hand peeled peaches and homemade.  My sister is quite the critic of peaches.  OK, the peach cobbler is the best there is.  No comparison - excellent *****.  Eat here you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I am from California and was on vacation with my boyfriend in AZ. On our way out of town we decided we were craving some BBQ and I found Honey Bears BBQ on Yelp so we decided to go!!

Best BBQ ever, our food came out literally in about 2 minutes of ordering and my favorite was the Coleslaw. I've had lots of Coleslaw before and honestly this stuff is amazing. I even asked if they would ship some to us in California!! 

If you're looking for an inexpensive, fast and filling BBQ place, this is the spot to go!!"}
{"text":"Here is my tale of two visits.  A couple of my friends know I am a big fan of ribs so they gifted me groupons with $10 for $20 worth of food.  I figured how can you go wrong with that?

Having never eaten here before I didn't know what to expect.  I went on a Saturday afternoon and the place was rather empty.  I proceeded to order a full rack of ribs, corn, and the sweet potato tots.  As expected, the food came out very fast.  At first glance the portion was huge, however the second I took my first bite I realized these were no fall of the bone ribs.  It was sort of amusing.  As was chewing away on my ribs, I read their sign about not needing teeth to eat there.  I say false!  On a high note though, the sweet potato tots were out of this world and you have to work hard to mess up corn on the cob.  Both sides received an A.

As for the cleanliness, it was what I expect from a BBQ place.  It wasn't gross but it wasn't super clean either.  The gal that took my order was polite and didn't seem as disinterested as other reviewers have mentioned.  Overall it was a 3 star experience.

As for the second visit I wanted to try other things.  This time I ordered the half rack of ribs half chicken, corn on the cob, cowbro beans, and some peach cobbler.  The chicken was very tender and flavorful.  Having expected the ribs to be a little harder, I took a big bite but this time the ribs so tender, that I bit right through the bone.  Basically, I had a mouthful of black bone marrow and dry meat.  It was quite unpleasant and it continued for the remainder of the meal.  How much more inconsistent can you be on the cooking?  Lastly, the cowbro beans were not all that great either and the peach cobbler tasted like canned peaches and a piece of old bread.  This experience was closer to 1 star.  

If it wasn't for the free groupons I received I probably wouldn't have gone back the second time.  When it comes to spending my hard earned money, it won't be here unfortunately."}
{"text":"I went here to compare to Big City BBQ in Mesa. This place is decent. The BBQ is good, but not great. I would go here more for lunch than a dinner."}
{"text":"Good barbecue and I liked the Mac n cheese. The portions are nice and we both rather enjoyed it ! The peach cobbler is must  try!"}
{"text":"Boy was I disappointed and embarrassed. I had friends visiting from out of state, and I told them that Honey Bear's was the best bbq in town. We arrived Sunday night around 7pm. They were out of ribs...My friends ordered the rib and chicken combo. One substituted the rib tips for the ribs,  and the other friend ordered sliced beef. I ordered a half lb of pulled pork and two sides. They ended up \"finding\" some ribs for one of the orders, but there were obviously boiled or pressure-cooked and not slow smoked.. The chicken came out 10 minutes after the rest of the food, and it was also either microwaved or pressure cooked.. My food, (which was ordered a couple of minutes after theirs) took over 30 minutes to arrive.  I overheard them telling the people sitting behind me that they were out of almost everything..

Then, to top it all off, we were overcharged.  We showed them a four square check in which was supposed to get me one free side, but I was still charged for both my sides. The cashier girl was new and obviously in WAY over her head. 

I was so embarrassed after raving about this place, to have it be so very bad..."}
{"text":"Yet another great hole in the wall joint. They have awesome pulled pork sandwiches. This place is a local classic."}
{"text":"I love this place. I usually go a couple times a month. I've been to another location of theirs in Chandler, but mostly I end up going to the one on Central. 

The pulled-pork sandwich hits the spot and the sauce they have just makes it. It has just enough spice to give it a little bite that I think BBQ needs to have. Every chance I get, I bring out of towners to experience it and they love it. With the exception of Southerners, they are incredibly insane when it comes to BBQ it seems. :)"}
{"text":"We paid 32.00 for lunch for two; so not worth it. I remember a couple of years ago, honey bears use to be great, now it's just blah. The meat had no flavor whatsoever not even salt. The only thing that wasn't so bad were the fries. The tea read traditional sweet tea, and there was nothing sweet about it. I gave it one star because of the fries. Also sauce use to be good, and not anymore."}
{"text":"I ordered a BBQ beef sandwich meal which also came with one side and a drink. I had the potato salad side dish which was served in a small styrofoam container. The potato salad ok but not spatacular. The sandwich was awful. The BBQ was cut in small pieces akin to pulled meat instead of slices. Then the doused the whole sandwich with BBQ sauce which made the bread became so soggy that one cannot even picked it up. I ate the sandwich with a fork instead. The BBQ was ok. It is not close to Texas or Kansas City BBQ."}
{"text":"They have 2 meals on the menu: chicken and ribs. When we went at 7 on Saturday night, it was empty and they were out if ribs... So if you like chicken or chicken, you should try it!"}
{"text":"Went to the location on central. They were put of Cole slaw, no big deal I'll find something else. However, it took forever to get the food, I didn't get my sides and there were no forks! How would I have eaten Mac n cheese without a fork?"}
{"text":"Full disclosure I rarely write Yelp reviews but I do eat at a lot of restaurants around the valley being a young single male professional who doesn't cook.  I ate here today for lunch and it was so delicious I promised the owner I'd write him a 5-star review on Yelp on the way out.  So here I am being a man of my word.  When I arrived I scanned the menu and was recommended the pulled pork by the friendly cashier at the front -- but then I saw they had chicken and beef as well .. decisions, decisions.  At that point I knew I had to do the sliders so I could try all 3!  Mac n' Cheese for the side was a no-brainer.  I even got some chicken wings too.  Hey don't judge, your boy was hungry.  All were phenomenal.  I especially liked the wings and the sauce they had.  It wasn't your typical thick, ketchupy BBQ sauce -- it was lighter and tasted delicious.  The people were very nice and I really appreciated that the owner Mark came over to my table and wanted to make sure my food tasted great.  We chatted for a bit and he told me he's had this business for 28 years!  Wow, I respected that.  I could tell he was a hard worker who takes care of his customers.  The place was packed for lunch with professionals like myself so its a testament that they likely have a lot of regulars.  I feel that's the lifeblood of any great business.  Great food, great service, fair prices -- its that simple.  I would definitely recommend anyone to try this place out if they are in the Phoenix/Tempe/Scottsdale tri-city area.  I told Mark I'd bring some colleagues for lunch here in the next couple weeks.  5-stars!!!"}
{"text":"I have to admit I love my Baby back ribs, but we meat eating Americans need to remember what a true rib is - and that is the Spare Rib. 
HB's does them right. 
You say spare ribs have less meat than the baby b's -not true, as much meat on the spare - it's just stretched over a longer bone. This results in smaller bites of meat - but - a higher ratio of sauce to meat with each bite.Honey Bears sauce is right on, and the meat is so tender. Finger licking good spare ribs. This is a Soul Food rib joint. 
Sides - fresh, crispy,creamy, tangy cole slaw. Beans - interesting seasoning, afew chunks of hot link, and I think chopped up pickles? Really good. 
Don't forget the sweat potato pie."}
{"text":"I do not know why this place is getting such low stars, I feel there may be people who are having biases towards the owner. I have never been really a \"barbeque\" man and was in the area for business reasons so I decided to stop by and grab something to eat because the smell was very good, I am really glad I did because it went very above expectations! I ordered the pulled pork sandwhich combonotion and you get the sandwhich and macoroni with good barbeque sauce, the sandwhich was very good but my only complaint was the bread was very weak and it made the sandwhich messy to eat. The mac and cheese was average nothing special but because I did not realize I walked in closing time 8 pm the management was nice enough to give me free chili pork bowl! They were very kind and courteous and attended and answered any questions I had. Next time I am in the area I will stop by again!

Good food, nice people, good barbeque sauce, good establishment all around"}
{"text":"The restaurant smelled like a super old motel. It had a damp dingy warm environment. It was tacky there were ads on the tabletops. Why is there a line on the receipt for a tip when you aren't served anything. We got our own drinks, napkins, straws, spoons, food, and sauce. So why is there room for a tip? Now the food. My husband ordered the 5dollar ribs with fries and mac and cheese. The sauce was too spicy for bbq sauce for us it overpowered the meat flavor. All you could taste was the sauce which was not a good thing. The mac and cheese was very bland and tasteless. I had the butterfly shrimp which was the special of the day and mac and cheese as well. Th e butterfly shrimp was pretty tasteless as well. It was okay, nothing special about it. We left unsatisfied and disappointed also a little grossed out. My husband started feeling sick as we were leaving.. I think the best part was the fries and they weren't all that great either. The food was definitely not worth the price.. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Having spent a lot of time in Texas and Oklahoma, I've eaten a lot of BBQ.  But I'll review Honey Bear's on its own merits (or lack).

I've been eating at HB for 20 years, the location on Van Buren mostly.  This location isn't so great.  

Pros:  It's fast, the meat is tasty, the sauce is good too, a bit on the thin side, sweet/sour and spicy.  Cobbler is good.

Cons:  It's really expensive, service is almost menacing in its unfriendliness, place is sticky/dirty, sides are hit-or-miss, mostly miss.

Tasty smoky meat.  You'll pay dearly for it, $5 for a small sandwich, more for a large, sides are extra.  One time with a bud we figured that HB charges about $25-$30/lb for their meat as ordered in the restaurant.  Ribs and other whole pieces of meat put you easily in the $15+ range.  Corn is mushy, beans are tasty, potato salad is subjected to strange spice-abuse by a cook who doesn't understand what potato salad is.  

Drinks are fountain and iced tea.  You can't get a small cup of sauce to go, even with the leftovers from your $20 rib dinner - you have to pay and pay.  This sort of stinginess doesn't sit well with me.  

The place is dirty, with sticky tables and chairs.  Overall appearance is dingy.  Service is always unsmiling, unhelpful, all business.  They don't make you feel like coming back.  I don't go back now unless I'm forced to by downtown coworkers."}
{"text":"Ok.. this is the best downtown BBQ joint- with that being said.. it might be one of the only BBQ joints downtown!! It use to be some chain establishment; you can tell by the A-frame building. basic menu for the most part with Specials throughout the week. I wish they had Rib Tip all day long, just not Friday nights! I had the #4; a sandwich and 3 ribs, a side and a drink.. I think it was $11. Overall- a good feed! They have sauce available, which is needed- they do not drowned it in sauce- they let you dish it out yourself! very good sauce BTW!!
NUTSHELL- Worth the trip if you are downtown, watch out for the lunch time crowds!"}
{"text":"My wifes combo was okay but my sandwich was so tough I could not eat it! The check out lady kept  tweaking like she was on something.
My wife may go back but I never will! I could see while waiting they got some orders wrong and just dumped the food back into the pot in the kitchen!"}
{"text":"Completely disappointed, use to be the spot back in the day. Shade of its former self, THIS PLACE IS FOR THE WEAK FOLKS NOW!!! Don't waste your time. My guy got a 1/4 chicken combo and only got one small piece of chicken that barely had any meat on it. And correct me if I'm wrong but I thought that when you order a 1/4 chicken it comes with a wing, breast, and thigh. Well that's what it use to be but not anymore. It gets one star only because my chicken slider was okay, but my fries were hard and under cooked, plus the cook never changed his gloves. Yuck!!!!"}
{"text":"This is the second time I have been here and I feels it's average for BBQ. The potato salad was very cold, almost frozen and did not have any flavor. I was not full from my sandwich and since I didn't eat the potato salad was going to get peach cobbler but they didn't have any that day :-( Pretty \"basic\" place."}
{"text":"Don't let the neighborhood turn you off - this is the BEST BBQ in Phoenix! Totally back to basics BBQ - no fancy fusion food here!

Try: Everything"}
{"text":"The establishment is dirty and run down. Paint peeling, dirty floors, dirty window sills and windows and broken unsanitary bathroom. Makes me question the cleanliness back in the kitchen and their safety with food prep. The \"meal\", which they refer to as a \"plate\" was expensive and didn't even come with a beverage. They are charging an outrageous $2.89 for a fountain drink. The pulled pork sandwich was good but not great and certainly not worth (in my opinion) the price they are charging."}
{"text":"we walked in, it was a ghost town at 5pm, walked up- ordered our dishes and special priced beers ( Stella and Shock top ale super cheap) and like 30 seconds later it was called out ready to go!! My bf says he sees this place smoking all their stuff early in the morning and the result: DELICIOUS RIBS!!! literally fall off the bone hell- i could have EATEN the bone it was all slow cooked to perfection. Baked beans, potato salad all delicious. I made a point to compliment the owner and he treated me to their HOMEMADE ice cream (vanilla bean) to take home =-) we WILL be back and this time, I'm bringing more people. I tell as many people I can about this unknown treasure we have finally discovered."}
{"text":"1st time visit and the food was great! My husband and I really enjoyed it. I had pulled pork and Mac and cheese. He had beef brisket and Mac and cheese. The flavor was awesome and the sause was sweet and spicy. I would go there again and recommend it to others."}
{"text":"Hands down the best ribs I've had in my life.  My first visit here was about a year ago.  Though I was a little afraid of the area and the sketchy look of the place I was taken by a good friend and my visiting father so I couldn't say no.  We all ordered sandwiches; I had the brisket and my father ordered a half order of ribs for us to share.  Now I have to say I'm not a BBQ person.  I'm not a fan of 99% of the sauce out there.  I reluctantly gave it a try and almost had to sit on my now saucy hands to keep from eating the whole plate.  The brisket was decent, but nothing compared to the ribs.  I've been here probably about 25 times since my first visit and now exclusively get ribs.  The sides in my opinion aren't really worth mentioning.  The coleslaw had as much black pepper in it as any other ingredient and the cowbro beans are kinda spicy.  The mac n cheese is good, not kraft or velveeta but not special.  The ribs are definitely the way to go for a happy full belly."}
{"text":"I can't even give this place a one star.  The food was digusting.  I ordered half of the rack of ribs.  They were smeared in bbq sauce, which is my fault as I failed to advise that I like my sauce on the side.  The rib meat was gross and tasted OLD.  I can't believe what I experienced yesterday afternoon.  My sides were also terrible.  I don't like my beans to taste sweet with bbq sauce.  I was expecting more of cowboy bean taste.  The potato salad was not my cup of tea and over peppered.  I didn't care about the sides as much as those darn ribs...tasting so old.  It appeared all they did was cook the ribs and then throw sauce on them...gross and filthy tasting.   I have eaten at Honey Bears on Van Buren over the years and loved it each time. Sorry but the food at this Tempe Honey Bears location was out right terrible.  This location is very nice and new, but obviously they don't know how to cook and used expired meat...gross!!  I was so looking forward to great bbq that I always experienced at the restaurant on Van Buren.  I will never return."}
{"text":"You can certainly tell which reviews were written by friends, employees or owners.
The beans were the only item with any taste. Soggy meat, held in hot water, sauce that didn't  qualify as sauce.
I've had bad, however this tops the list!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I was underwhelmed with the flavor of the meat here.  Side dishes were pretty good. If you want a good smoke ring and flavorful meat I prefer Rudy's. However, if you're in downtown phx and don't want to travel to the 'burbs this place will do"}
{"text":"Best BBQ in the Phoenix area, and for the record, my favorite place to eat in the city. I have lived here for most of my life and have yet to find anything better. The Meat is Delicious and the sauce steals the show, its wonderful and is always served up hot and all you want is available. many BBQ places give you a ketchup bottle of thick cold sauce and it ruins your hot sandwich. oh, and these are not the best ribs i have ever had, its the BBQ Sandwich that is the must eat. Also they have superb seasoned fries that go perfectly with the sandwich. I have had many other bbq places in the city, Including JOE'S in gilbert, but Joe's just isn't in the same category as Honey Bears. The meat is tough at Joe's and the sauce is averge."}
{"text":"3 of us went there each had a regular sandwich, combo 1,  which was GROSS.  The bottom bun appeared to be dipped in the meat juices prior to the meat being placed on top.  The meat did taste good if eaten with a fork and all bread products were avoided.  Coleslaw was only tolerable, to soupy and peppery.  What happened here?"}
{"text":"Great food to get for catering an event.  Everybody was happy and full.  The price was reasonable."}
{"text":"ahhh, honey bear's.  i'm not sure where the name comes from, but i am sure the food is DARN GOOD.  the meat is ridiculously tender.  the sauce is good, runny, but good.  somehow i end up consuming a couple tubs of it without realizing.

the proportions aren't very big, for the sandwiches or the sides, but i guess you can argue that it helps you to not over-eat.  prices are pretty fair though. and again, the taste...mmm...

they cater too, which is pretty amazing when you show up somewhere and it's buffet honey bear's time!"}
{"text":"So I had came to the place like 5 years ago and I remember it was so good and yesterday my husband wanted to come go yesterday to try it out and I told him it was so good but when we went it was horrable food crapy customer service as well never go there again ... sorry honey bears you use to be good ... 2/13/2016"}
{"text":"Great food, always consistent. Prices fair, service spotty but acceptable. I visit about every 8 weeks and look forward to getting my q on"}
{"text":"They advertise \"you don't need no teeth to eat our meat.\" Well, yes you do! I bought a full rack of baby backs and couldn't wait to get home with them. They were VERY tough... and had very little meat on them."}
{"text":"Ordered the #1 combo. Sub-par pulled pork sandwich. I was very surprised to find that the meat was tough and hard to chew. No real bbq (smokey) taste. The bun was pretty cheap and mushy after being soaked through. Bbq sauce was nothing special. Fries were standard. It wouldn't have been such a disaster if i hadn't paid $10.49 (not including tax) for the lunch time meal. I won't be back. Prices are too high for standard fare."}
{"text":"The downtown location has turned into a dump!!!  Waited 1 hr for a beef sandwich.  People actually applauded when they called their order.  All trash cans were full and stacked with plates.  Sauce container was empty with plastic forks at the bottom that had fallen in.  The food was sloppy and they had a bunch of teenagers running the business.  The filth was gross!!  I used to be a fan but now I'm taking 1 yr off before I return!!"}
{"text":"Have been going to this restaurant and had it used for catering at parties in my home for 25 years always good food until today had my housekeeper pick up for four people when I got up from my nap I went to make my sandwich and it was all grizzle and fat it wasn't the pulled pork that soft you definitely needed teeth to eat their meat in fact I ended up giving it to my dog hopefully this was just an anomaly but it would be a while before I would go back"}
{"text":"My dad used to have this saying.  \"If you put it on top of your head your tongue would beat your brains out trying to get to it\".  That sums up how i feel about honey bears.

After living in St Louis for a while i feared i would never find BBQ that met my standards ever again.  But this place is probably the best in the valley.  Many places try, but none can match this place for the portions or the price.

Only reason they didnt get 5 stars is the lack of cornbread.  What is with BBQ places here and no freakin cornbread?  Blasphemy. But other than that, perfection."}
{"text":"Went to Honey Bears for the first time with my mother ,Bruce was very nice and the food was excellent"}
{"text":"Delicious!!!  Tried other BBQ places but this is the best.  I love that I can get the BBQ on the side and TWO meats on one sandwhich.  Not a fan of the sides except the Mac n Cheese.  Clean and cute decorations and speedy service."}
{"text":"Great old school restaurant, great BBQ, best sauce.
Scottsdale folk stay away it has a dive feel to it."}
{"text":"Flies everywhere. Gross beef. Pretty good ribs. Not great sides. Good BBQ sauce. Terrible service. Broken soda machine. Altogether made an awful dining experience. I will never visit again.

Seriously, flies all over the dining room? Reminds me of kitchen nightmares. Nasty."}
{"text":"This is the only time in my life that I've ever bought a meal, sat down to eat it and then immediately threw it away. Just yuck. Watery pulled pork, slaw had no flavor, and just yuck all around."}
{"text":"Downtown Phoenix with an old school sloppy type BBQ place? Great, it's not the best but it is very good. I got the 1/2 rack pork ribs $11.49, which were tender, moist and fall off the bone good. The sauce was slightly hot, sweet and vinegary. Comes with 2 sides, I got cole slaw which was average good, and the Browbeans which had BBQ sauce, and sausage pieces, a very good choice. I got a peach cobbler dessert, and I liked it but it is kinda average, the crust parts were mixed in with the cobbler and were soggy, to bad, it was probably very good before that was done."}
{"text":"I have driven by this place numerous times and remember a friend had told me it was great. I think I just lost a friend unless he wants to give me the $30 I waisted on this garbage at lunch today. I can't believe they call this place a BBQ joint. I asked about the rib tips and was told not today... only on Fridays so then I asked about brisket. She said they have a beef sandwich and they could just give me the meat from the sand which but still couldn't tell me if it was brisket. My wife ordered a salad and Sweet Potato fries and I ordered a half rack ribs and sweet potato tator tots. The salad was what I expected except the dressing was a couple pouches like you find at a fast food place. The sweet potato fries were covered in black pepper (not something my wife was expecting), the tator tots were good but obviously store bought. Now for what I came here for... the ribs. They were the most disgusting ribs I have ever had. They were overcooked, not properly smoked, reheated what seems like multiple times and then covered with a ton of BBQ sauce. The sauce was descent but was needed to cover up the bad flavor of the rib. This is not BBQ and NOT what I expected. For someone who doesn't appreciate good BBQ and will eat almost anything that's covered in a sweet sauce, maybe this is right for you but if you expect Honey Bears BBQ to serve BBQ, you will quickly learn as I did the expensive way, they don't. I do not recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"This place sucks. My friend ordered the last catfish and told us it would be a 12 minutes to wait. No problem. 30 minutes later my friend is still waiting on his food when he hears the guy at the register serve my friend's catfish to someone else. He then says he's sorry and that's it. He also wouldn't let me friend order anything else off the menu. This place is not that great anyway and their cornbread sucks the big one. Avoid this place at all costs! Go to Little Miss BBQ. It's well worth the wait in line and the people are way nicer."}
{"text":"I this is your idea of good BBQ, you obviously don't know anything about what good BBQ should taste like.  I saw one review that suggested you eat the meat with the sides - looking for flavor I guess.  Lame attempt at sauce, ho hum buns.  I think the only reason they've lasted is that this town doesn't seem to have much competition in the BBQ department."}
{"text":"I was in the area and found a yelp deal for this place with their mobile app, so I came in with my 2 kids, a friend, and his 2 kids.  The food was OK.  Not the best BBQ, but it satisfied the craving I had.  The yelp deal seemed to confuse the staff a bit, but it brought the price of the meal down to what I would consider fair for what we received.  It's an order-and-pick-up-at-the-counter kind of place, nice and open, nothing fancy.  That combined with the place being pretty empty made it a good place for having young kids.  I'm not a BBQ connoisseur so I can't say exactly what the food was missing, I just know I've had better and I've had worse (for my liking), so I'm going to call the food OK.  The staff was a little confused and food was pretty slow to come out but everyone was friendly and helpful so I will call service OK. The kids had a good time and the overall value (after the discount) was not bad so I will round my 2.5 stars up to 3 instead of down to 2."}
{"text":"Great food, typically nice BBQ style eatery.  Front counter guy was very nice & informative"}
{"text":"One of the better BBQ joints in AZ. Four might be a high mark as far as a authentic BBQ goes. But I go back often enough to give it more than three.

The sauce is great, the pork and beef are great. Messy just like it's supposed to be."}
{"text":"This place is average. I had the vm1 with bbq chicken sandwich and potato salad. The meal was out quick and it was relatively cheap. The chicken was a touch dry for my liking, the bun was a little soggy and the bbq sauce had a watery consistency and lacked flavor. The potato salad was pretty good and a large portion."}
{"text":"Let's be honest, when it comes to BBQ places that are decent, the valley is sorely lacking.  So, when I brought up the fact that I was having a serious itch for some Q, a coworker brought Honey Bear's up. Having not heard of it, I was in for it.

The establishment is a hole in the wall, butsome of the best BBQ I have ever had was in holes in the wall (i.e. Aurthur Bryant's in Kansas City). We got out of the car and were greeted by the pleasant smell of wood smoking meat, and it smelled awesome. I was super excited...until we stepped into the door.

The aroma went from pecan wood chips to backed up sewage. I kid you not it smelled like someone emptied their bowels in the middle of the lobby. People would come in and turn right back around and leave. But, my friend assured me this was the place to be so darn it, I was going to stick it out.

I got the BBQ chicken sandwich. The sauce had very little flavor to it but the meat was tender (there is your one star, the ability to not dry out chicken). I asked about what side the cashier would prefer and she just shrugged and said \"I guess the potato salad.\" As expected from the response, it was mediocre.

But that smell went back with me to the office where a coworker asked if I had been sitting in an alley with a drunk during lunch. I had to change my shirt but the smell was burned into my nostrils.

Never again...NEVER...AGAIN."}
{"text":"Real BBQ smoked in a smoker.  Tangy and tasty sauce.  I speak on the one on V an Buren which I've been going to since the 1970's.  Their beans and potato salad are out of this world.  Always try to go to mom and pop joints as opposed to chains.  That's worked out well over the years in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Honey bears is damn good food.  Don't expect anything fancy, just some of the best dang meats and sides you can get in Phoenix.  Highly recommend the chicken or brisket and you can't go wrong with the Mac and cheese or cowbro beans."}
{"text":"This is a great BBQ place, known for their sauce but their beans are fantastic (i get those over their sandwiches) and 2 for 1 beers everyday.   If your uppity maybe not the place for your but if you don't care what a place looks like as long as it has great food check it out."}
{"text":"Love their BBQ sauce! I pick up lots to bring back home whenever I visit AZ. Pull pork Bbq sandwhich is delicious. Corn bread is one of the best I've had. Service is a little slow. Wish they have businesses in Cali."}
{"text":"Good eats.  My food was just short of epic.  The beef sandwich was delicious and the pork ribs were fantastic.  The ribs are not skimpy on the meat and it comes right off the bone.  Loved the sauce, very tangy and has a good kick.

I arrived just before the lunch crowd began to pick up.  Looks like it can get a bit hectic when large crowds come due to all the people swarmed around the small counter ordering and picking up their meals."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Honey Bear's since they opened.  Back then the owner's where the cooks and family members worked the counter.  The rib tips on Fridays and the cocktails had the place packed.  Fast forward to today and a lot has changed in the kitchen and the counter.  I narrowed my selection to the pulled chicken, the pulled beef, and plenty of sauce.  I like the sliders on the menu but if you don't eat pork...check your order before you leave.  Ditch the bread and drench the meat with sauce and magic can happen!  I can't recommend any of the sides...but that's according to my taste...you may love them."}
{"text":"I can't remember how long it has been since I started going to Honey Bear's BBQ.  It has to be at least fifteen years.  I love this place.  

I was there today for lunch and had the shredded chicken and a couple of hotlinks.  Delicious!!  Also had some coleslaw too.  I think I've had just about everything on the menu and it is all GREAT!  The service is good and the staff is always friendly.

If I have one complaint, it is that I am sticky and smell of BBQ sauce the rest of the day.... it could be worse.

Any place that's slogan is \" You don't need no teeth to eat our meat\"  has my vote.  The truth of the matter is, the slogan is right."}
{"text":"\"You don't need no teeth to eat our meat!\" the slogan for Honey Bear's Bar-B-Q proudly proclaims and they are telling you the truth! Wonderfully tender and tasty pork, chicken and brisket that fall apart as you eat them in to an amborisa of meat and spicy sauce!

Honey Bear's has been a valley gem for decades, their original location a run building in Phoenix near Papago Park that you would never expect would house some of the finest barbecue this side of the Mississippi river. But the aroma would draw you in anyway.

That's how I first found them 20 some years ago, by smell while bicycling near Papago Park the wind brought the smells of the promise of smoked pork at it's finest. I was not disappointed then and never have been since.

Home of the hottest Hot Links around, Cowbro beans, Fried Catfish, Beef Brisket, Pulled Pork and Sweet Potato Pie.

Now Honey Bears has 4 valley locations, but success has not affected the wonderful quality of their food and their prices are the lowest anywhere for genuine slow smoked barbecue!"}
{"text":"The food wasn't very tasty. The bathrooms will make you leave and not even ask for your money back."}
{"text":"What has happened to the sauce? It does not taste the same not only that it's put in an old apple cider container. It used to serve it in containers with their name on it. Service is definitely lacking on both stores Central and Van Buren. we have been going for years and with the exception of one time had excellent service but the last 2 times once at Central and now at Van Buren service is just above rude.  
I really miss the old sauce and service with a smile."}
{"text":"I used to fruequent Honey Bears on a regular basis when I worked across the street about 8 years ago but haven't been much since.

The food hasn't changed since then and is still tasty but the building itself has really gone down hill. I was surprised by how run down it looks and that numerous surfaces looked like they hadn't been cleaned in a while (I was there at noon). They were also out of pulled pork and told me there would be a 20 min wait.

I enjoy their sandwiches and fries so I'm sure I'll come back but it's not appealing to me from an aesthetic perspective.

Their BBQ sauce is the thin kind but tasty!"}
{"text":"Great place for pulled pork BBQ sandwiches! Awesome beans and coleslaw to go with your meal. Just enough to fill you up and make you happy at lunch time. They also have Big Red! If you're in the area, also look for Hap's Pit Barbecue and you can compare both places, see which one you like better!"}
{"text":"Above average BBQ at a resonable price.  Large portions."}
{"text":"I am EXTREMELY happy they serve rib tips every day now. The sauce is amazing. Get buns to soak it all up. If you run out of buns, go to the store and buy more buns. Or you can mail me the sauce so I can dispose of it properly. Or not. Just don't waste the sauce."}
{"text":"It was okayish. The person taking our order was pretty sweet, but the food was flavorless and mushy. The beef brisket was probably the best part of the meal but it wasn't anything to write home about. Restaurant itself was a little warm, despite the cool day. It was overall a really \"meh\" experience, and at $30+ for two people it's not worth it."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money. Mediocre sandwiches, too expensive because they come with no sides at all, not even a plate; you have to eat off the wrap it comes in and below average service. I'll never go back."}
{"text":"Honey bears offers a different type of BBQ sauce, it's the runnier kind that also packs more of a kick. I personally prefer a thicker sauce but this one is still tasty. They keep some warm out in the open for you to help yourself which is nice. I think that for such a casual place the prices are pretty steep. The sandwiches, even the large size, are not very large and everything is priced ala carte so you end up having a hefty bill if you want a decent sized sandwich with a side and a drink. This probably wouldn't be the first place I'd run to if I was craving BBQ but it's decent."}
{"text":"Honey Bears was one of my first restaurant meals in Phoenix, as I was brought here by a buddy who worked downtown and who moved here from Cali a year before I did. He was raving about it and I thought, \"Well, I like BBQ. Actually, l like BBQ a LOT. Let's go!\"

And, so...well...Honey Bears is what it is. A low-key BBQ joint where you can get your mess on. Decent sandwiches (chicken, brisket, etc.) and BBQ sauce - but I was thinking this was going to knock me backwards with how good it was where in reality it was just, \"Well, I'd definitely eat here again, but ain't rushing to do it.\" The patronage can be, uh, \"colorful\" and \"interesting\" at times, especially the later at night you go (not that I have anything against people talking to themselves).

But I do appreciate that it's still there, a stalwart against all the crazy development happening around it. For those folks not living in $1 million condos on Central, they still need a place to go, eat, and drip BBQ sauce on their office clothes with not a care in the world.

3 stars."}
{"text":"I can't believe that there are ANY negative reviews of Honey Bear's!  I've been a customer for decades, having started when the owners and founders were smoking meat in a converted 50-gal. drum outside the original East Phoenix location.

I now frequent the Central Ave. location and the food is still as good as it's always been.  

If all that matters to you is ambiance, this is probably not the place for you. Honey Bear's is all about the food.

Someone complained that the pork was too soggy.  Another that the pork was too dry.  HOW can it be both??  The pulled pork IS \"soggy\" because it's JUICY!  Honey Bear's pulled pork is to DIE for!

Someone actually dissed the barbecue sauce!  I've been hitting barbecue joints from the Mississippi to all points west, and HB's sauce is hands-down the best I've ever found.  

The only complaint I have is that when I tried to order the baby back ribs (the best thing that has ever been in my mouth), I was told that they are no longer carrying them but are now offering spare ribs.  So, I tried the spare ribs and, while they are good, they just don't compare to the baby backs.

I had never tasted \"collard greens\", so I decided to try them.  Now I'm hooked.  Since I liked them so much as HB's, I ordered them when I went to Notorious P.I.G., another barbecue restaurant. I had to throw those away...they were loaded with vinegar.

I will continue to buy the mouth watering pulled pork, pulled chicken, and collard greens from Honey Bear's even though I now live miles away (and right between two other BBQ restaurants).  And, for other HB's fans, \"Deal Chicken\" frequently offers coupons for Honey Bear's which cost $15 for $30 worth of food.  Beat THAT!"}
{"text":"you really don't need no teeth to eat their meat

ribs are good. meat, tender, hanging off the bones, smothered with sweet BBQ sauce. beans taste similar to the sauce, sans meat. coleslaw is also good, but pretty standard. 

this type of food is great when life is on your mind"}
{"text":"The food is simply awesome! The bbq sauce is soooo good I could eat that alone! My wife bought a Groupon (really good idea) because now I just found a great new place to take friends and family..."}
{"text":"I've been to this location more times than I could ever count. It has always been my \"go to\"! But $10 for a combo meal?! HOOOLY MOLY prices have gone up and absolutely nothing has changed!!! I truly cant believe how bad this place has become over the years. The young cashier girl was so rude. She was almost annoyed that we were coming in- to spend $24 on lunch! The peach cobbler was TERRIBLE. I had to scrap the bottom of the crock pot thing to get some extra BBQ sauce... I'm SO disappointed. Every time I go in it just gets worse and worse. There are so many other wonderful places to eat in downtown Phoenix. Honey Bears, you're just making it easier and easier to get else where."}
{"text":"This place is an amazing restaurant. Honey bears BBQ deserves a better rating. The pulled pork is amazing! The beef brisket is amazing! I have never had something anywhere close to those sweet potato tots. The beans were delicious! Every bite was some new combo of each and I couldn't stop eating. The people giving honey bears BBQ a bad rating are people who had one little thing happen, so they try to stick it to the restaurant and make it look shitty, when it's not! It's delicious! Try this food! Get the sweet potato tots! You will absolutely not regret it!"}
{"text":"We're from the San Francisco Bay Area visiting the Phoenix area.
One of our regular stops is to the Honey Bear BBQ (done this for years).....and it's always the same: great tasting BBQ and friendly service.  We now have all of our friends come here on their visits to Phoenix and they share the same sentiments."}
{"text":"Terrible at epic porportions.  A crime against BBQ.  As a Southerner, I wish to bring a class action suit aginst this place for claiming to \"put some South in your mouth\" on the sign out front.  The ribs were dry, flavorless and covered in some type of runny sauce that was essentially a watered down ketchup.  The Mac and Cheese side was basically Kraft from a box.  The cole slaw had a nice black pepper flavor and I actually liked that.  The place is a dive, service rude and the bathroom filthy.  To top it all off, I went here with a Yelp check in offer of $2 off if you spend $10.  well, the cashier had never heard of Yelp before and had to go talk to someone for quite some time (holding up the line) before granting the discount.  Then, the cash register only gave a $1 discount.  To make matters even more aggrevating, the recepit claimed I got the $2 Tuesday discount but clearly only took $1 off the bill.  So, in addition to being unable to serve good food or clean the establishment, they stink at math too.  
I've been in Phoenix only one day on a business trip, but surely there is at least some type of \"real\" BBQ in the town.  Guess I'll stick to Mexican food this trip.
Trust me...if you have even like BBQ a little bit, stay away from this place.  Your taste buds and self esteem will thank you."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for maybe a dozen years, and we've had really good barbecue here, and the service has always been polite. I think their sauce is too thin and watery for my taste, but their ribs have always been very tender.
We went in last night for dinner and to pick up a bottle of sauce to mail to relatives across country. The dinners no longer come with a roll, and I had just a few bites of the peach cobbler before throwing it away. It's always been a cooked cobbler with a little cinnamon, but now it's cold, uncooked canned peaches, no spice, mixed with a gummy pastry shell. 
The ribs were still as tender as ever.
The main reason for my one star review is that when we went to buy a bottle of sauce, we didn't see any for sale. My husband asked if it was being sold in a store and the guy said A.J.'s had it but that he had a bottle to sell us. He charged us first, $6.99 plus tax, then said that he had hidden a stash of sauce in the back so his fellow employees wouldn't find it. We didn't know what that meant, but we waited while the guy was in the back for a few minutes. When he came out he handed my husband a bottle and we went out to the car, where I looked at it. It was unlabeled, unsealed and warm. Very warm. And sticky. I took it back in and said, \"You just filled this, right?\" He agreed. So I told him that we were sending it across country and that it might not be opened for weeks. I asked him if it was vacuum sealed (because of spillage and the fact that it was so warm and could breed bacteria). He smiled at me and said that yes, he had vacuum sealed it. 
Because I didn't want to send an unlabeled mystery bottle, we drove right over to A.J.'s and found Honey Bear's sauce on the shelf- same size, for $3.99. So why the price difference?
When we got home we unscrewed the top on the bottle from the restaurant and of course, it was not vacuum sealed, he had lied. And he'd been so reluctant to have a couple of bucks walk out the door that he was willing to potentially get people sick."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall restaurant with excellent tasting food and great customer service (awesome owner at the Van Buren location). Recommend the peach cobbler, delicious!"}
{"text":"Dry.  Bland.  Gristly.  Bad cuts of meat in sickly sweet sauce.  This place only makes me love my favorite BBQ places more (oh Fat Matt's Rib Shack, why do you have to be all the way in Atlanta??)

...and no greens on the menu?  For shame!"}
{"text":"The food was dry. The side salads were a joke. There was no dressing. The only saving grace was the Mac and cheese which still was very watery.  Wouldn't recommend for BBQ. Definitely better places out there."}
{"text":"Honey Bears is the best. Get over you coupon issue dude."}
{"text":"My best friend and I were in a tough spot a few months ago when we stumbled upon Honey Bears BBQ. Long story short we were stranded on the side of the road and needed a good place to eat. We walked into Honey Bears and was greeted by Mark, the owner. Mark treated us like family! We were hooked up with meaty mac and cheese. Which is mac and cheese, baked beans and shredded pork on top. TO DIE FOR. Mark charged our phones so we can contact a ride, fed us and left us feeling 10 times better than we did when we first walked in. 

Thanks for the hospitality, Mark! (From the two girls in 80's clothes last year, Andi and Megan)"}
{"text":"Disappointed...took my son to lunch & he ordered the chicken sliders, this was the absolute saddest representation I've experienced in quite a while. Not even my pork was up to par. WHAT HAPPENED? I hope this isn't becoming the norm."}
{"text":"I've heard honey bears was good and wanted to try it out. Unfortunately, this was the worst BBQ place I've ever been to. I ordered a full rack of ribs, and out of the 12 ribs, I only had 2 that were actually tender. The rest were tough and fatty. I'm pretty sure they were a few days old as well. The sides and the sauce were pretty good though. 

I was very disappointed and will not be back to either location."}
{"text":"Used to love the food at Honey Bears, but haven't been back in a while. Wife and I decided we didn't want to cook so we ordered on-line.
I will never eat at either of their places again. Amazing what can happen to a once great place in just a couple of years.
Ordered a pound of brisket and a pound of pork. Sides were cowboy beans and cole slaw.
Arrived to pick up my order only to be told no brisket or cowboy beans. Staff was about as apathetic as a funeral home. Too bad for you. Bye, bye.
No offer to substitute, no suggestions of any kind. I am only glad I decided to pay by cash so they didn't get my credit card number. Left empty handed and went to Waldo's up on 7th Street instead.
Customer BEWARE."}
{"text":"I've been going to them for years. Decades, even. They are probably my favorite BBQ joint (with Thee Pitts Again in second place).

I was disappointed. The meat (pulled pork) was fine. Good flavor, nicely smoked. But there was something off about the sauce they put on the meat. It had a =very= sharp vinegar taste. Now, I know that a tangy flavor is characteristic of the \"Tennessee\" style BBQ. It's what distinguishes it from Chicago, Texas or Kansas City BBQ which is generally thicker and sweeter. But this was like they put in twice the vinegar this time.  I know it wasn't my taste buds or something because the sauce in the pot for dine-in people to get extra tasted normal.

Then, the Cowbro' beans. They are perhaps my favorite thing about Honey Bear's. But they were also different. It tasted like one of the ingredients was spaghetti sauce. To be fair, I actually liked it. But it =was= different.

I hope my experience was a one-off. Otherwise, they've lost the handle on quality control."}
{"text":"I'm from TN and Honey Bears bq pork is as good as any you could get in TN."}
{"text":"OK, I am a Certified BBQ Judge, and was very disappoint with my visit Sunday night.  

Cold food, ribs had no meat on them, even my 6 year old said 'wow they don't have a good cook here daddy'

Out of forks, out of salad?  

Waited 40 min for cold food?  Please explain....

And one of the dirtiest bathrooms I have every seen."}
{"text":"Right next door to where we just moved in to and even while we were moving we could smell the pit. :) When I saw the building I already knew it had potential. 

I was told this location was the oldest and had better BBQ than others so with a Groupon Now I figured \"why not\". We were not disappointed whatsoever. This coming from a person who only eats his own BBQ and my family from Mississippi!

Had the 3 meat sampler to give all a whirl. Best were the ribs. Second, the beef. Third place tie goes to the pork and chicken but the sauce was great. Actually used it on my own slow cooked pulled pork for Super Bowl Sunday. 

Overall. I loved it."}
{"text":"Honeybears is a cutty little BBQ spot that does have some highlights. Their pulled chicken mini sandwiches, spicy beans, mac & peach cobbler are all really good. They have a great soda selection, and small dining area to eat there. Memphis style, which doesn't step to the Missouri BBQ I was raised on, but none the less still great. They always have a Groupon  or Yelp deal too."}
{"text":"One star is generous. If you're looking for good bbq, go elsewhere. I'm a huge fan of brisket. I think it is the true high water mark of bbq. I ordered the brisket at this location. I'm not sure what came out. 

I was given a half pound of mush, absolutely drenched in bbq sauce. Why put out bbq sauce if you're just gonna smother my order in it?  Brisket should be served in slices and BBQ sauce should be applied by the customer. There was not one discernible slice. It was like when you leave shredded wheat in the milk too long. Between that, the gallon of sauce, and the tremendous amount of grease, it was like a bowl of nasty soup. 

While AZ isn't known for BBQ quite yet, avoid this place if you get the urge. Rudy's kills this place any day of the week."}
{"text":"The pulled pork sandwich was good, but my wife and I occasionally found fatty pieces mixed in with the lean. We also had coleslaw and mac & cheese, which was overly salty. I would get potato salad instead of mac & cheese if we return there. 

For true Tennessee style, the BBQ sauce needs more of a vinegar base. Or at least, a vinegar-based sauce should be available at the counter, marked Tennessee style."}
{"text":"I drove a considerable distance to have this BBQ and was very unhappy with the meal experience. The pork was very dry and obviously old as were the sides. Price was ok but who cares if your meal tastes bad. The sauce was ok yet still unable to bring back to life the leather like dry pieces of pork I found in my sandwich with every bite. People who enjoy good BBQ should avoid this place.

I just read several other yelper reviews of this restaurant so Im going to raise my original 1 star to 2 for now and Im going to drive all the way back down to Central from Scottsdale to give them another shot who knows maybe I just got a bad batch then Im gonna come back here and comment on round 2."}
{"text":"I could see driving over from downtown for this.  Great, simple, tasty.  BBQ was best I've had outside of Oklahoma, and the cole slaw was very fresh (I'd go a bit less sweet, but it was nice and crunchy)."}
{"text":"I had there bbq beef sandwich, they do pile on the beef but the real winner here is the sauce.  The fries are made with seasoned salt just the way I like'em.  service..what service just order, pick it up and eat.  I'd be back but certaintly not for the ambience or friendly service."}
{"text":"This place is good. Portions are of good size, sauce is a nice tangy vinegar style that works great on the pulled pork sandwiches. Beans are just ok, prices might be a smidge higher than they should be. But overall if you want some good BBQ for lunch this place is great."}
{"text":"I was taken to Honey Bears BBQ by a co-worker for lunch and oh am I glad I learned about this place! We went this location by the airport, but I imagine they are all just as tasty. I got the 3 slider plate with a side of macaroni and cheese. We got it to go and the sauce (a very large portion) comes on the side. YUM! I'm a smaller girl but I can eat and this lasted me lunch and dinner - the leftovers were just as amazing. Can't wait to go back! :)"}
{"text":"Honey Bear's BBQ has a few great BBQ options. For a Phoenix BBQ joint, it is top of line in quality. I can not say as much for the service or atmosphere.

As far as basic BBQ menu options go, Honey Bear's is where it is at in Phoenix. I love their pulled pork sandwich and their sauce is fantastic. They have a great variety of sides to go along with it as well. I found their ribs meat to be delicious, however, it was pretty fatty at some parts. I have definitely had better elsewhere in the country.

Honey Bear's would be a four star restaurant with a few steps in the right direction towards improving costumer service and the costumer's dining experience. First, get wait staff the goes around and ask costumers about how they are enjoying their meal and if they could get them anything else to make their meal more enjoyable. Then, remove the ads from the table and reinvest profits into the business.

Pro-tip: Watch where you park so your car does not get towed. And be sure to check in on yelp to redeem your offer."}
{"text":"I am a huge BBQ fan, smoke my own, and visit BBQ wherever I travel.  This place is disappointing. I had the combo sandwich/ rib plate.  The ribs were very dry.  It didn't seem dry from overcooking, but overdry from sitting out too long.  They were also very salty. The pulled pork seemed good, but served on a plain \"wonderbread\" type bun.  Cole slaw was good, but not sure it wasn't store bought.  Beans were ok, a bit soupy, but I think it may be store bought and enhanced.  I didn't see or smell any smoker, so I wonder if they do any smoking on site.

The service was very slow, there was only one person preparing food and one person taking orders and packaging take out.  Had to wait long periods of time to have order taken and then again when there was an error with the order, even though there was no one in line and they were not very busy."}
{"text":"Amazing pulled pork sandwiches, great bbq sauce, best pork n beans ive ever had"}
{"text":"BBQ, a very unique experience, it is a truly American culinary art form that is diverse and has just as diverse group of passionate followers.

I would classify Honey Bears BBQ as awesome, in the wet BBQ mop using kind of BBQ.  If your perfect BBQ is a good dry rub BBQ brisket, or rack of ribs, you may want to skip.  However, if you are an individual who can enjoy the goodness of a pulled pork sandwich with a generous pool of their mostly sweet with a bit of spice/vinegar BBQ sauce, this could be your place.  

I love Honey Bears, it reminds me of a BBQ stand at a country fair that didn't leave town when the fair moved on.  You walk right up to the window order your BBQ they give you a cup to fill with soda and a number that they will call out over a intercom.  

It is not somewhere you take some one to \"wine and dine\" but it is a great place to grab a sandwich with a friend.  And do not skip out on the peach cobbler, very sweet and filled with tasty peaches you will not be disappointed."}

Only issues I had were no WI-FI, and the portions were a little on the smaller side. However, I'm 6'4 and 208 pounds, so for most people, the food sizes are appropriate. I had the pulled pork sandwich, collard greens, and beef BBQ sandwich. Both were freaking tasty as hell. Maybe they can add some bigger size options for us big guys? Either way, I'll be back, and am looking forward to enjoying their food and wonderful clean restaurant."}
{"text":"Had the 1/2 rack pork rib dinner.

Ribs, cowbrow beans and coleslaw.  All good to very good but not make a special trip for.  

Tables, settings were minimalist but ok.

Rest room was probably less than miniamilst.

Will try other places if I am in the mood for barbecue."}
{"text":"The pulled pork here is fantastic....and the BBQ sauce, I don't know what they do it, but it's finger lickin good!  They add just enough spice, sweet and kick to make it near-perfect.

You can't go wrong with a BBQ sandwich here.  There fries here are good and potato-ey - and their potato salad comes with a nice mayo whip celery and big chunks or potato.  Nice!   Don't expect much here in terms of decor - with the counter service and former Taco Bell digs."}
{"text":"I've been a Honey Bears customer for 30 years, but no more. I recently ordered nearly $200 worth of food for a party and they totally screwed up the order. That happens, right? But I called to complain, and also sent them an email, and I received no response. Beware bad customer service."}
{"text":"When I was living in Phoenix Honey Bear's was heavily part of my weekday lunch rotation. While it isn't the absolute best BBQ place, it certainly has its moments. For one thing, they make a mean pulled pork sandwich. Tender, juicy, and well-seasoned. Their BBQ sauce is the watery kind...I don't know what region that is from, but it's tasty. It's not something I am used to, and I don't think I have seen it anywhere else (so if you have any tips on that, let me know). Prices are super cheap and the guys behind the counter are friendly. This is just one of your local dives, but I am a fan. 

The pulled pork, beef, or chicken sandwiches are my favorites, but they make decent ribs. Their chicken can be a little under-seasoned/dry though. They also have REALLY ADDICTING French Fries. I'm a sucker for seasoned salt. Their sweet potato pie is also good. Free parking, decent hours, and TVs to watch the game over some BBQ and some beers."}
{"text":"Pulled is very tender with just the right smoke flavor.  Cowbro beans are outstanding.  The sauce has a delicious Tennessee style sweet and spicy  zip to it.  After the food was eaten, I could help but have a little more sauce by itself.  Mac and cheese is ok but better when I added some sauce.  Staff is friendly.  Good place to stop for a quick takeout.  I went back again and tried eating in and having brisket.  It was good but the pork was better.  You pay on ordering and are shown a tip prompt on the tablet before signing for a credit card.  You don't get served at your table but instead are called back to the counter to pick up your door tray."}
{"text":"Went there on a Sunday... not busy... only 2-3 other tables. The place was clean and very BBQ-esque feeling (which is good!); HOWEVER, it may have been a bad day or personal issues or ?  ... The big bald guy at the counter (I can say that because I'm a big bald guy), had a very unfriendly attitude.  Like I said... he may have just been having a bad day, BUT... we almost left before trying the BBQ. 

At then end of placing our order, we decided to add a piece of their sweet patato pie, listed on the wall menu... His response was only \"No Pie Today\".  No please... No Thank you... barely a grunt in reply to a question.

Definitely the the BEST RIBS I have ever had.  Tender, but not fall apart... slight crisp to the outside... plenty of meat on the bone and a great sauce with a little kick.

The food was so good I'll probably give it another try but I hope the big bald guy will be having a better day!"}
{"text":"I really like Honey Bear's, but do have issues.  I agree from below, 3.5 stars . . . I could be swayed to 4 if they were open later, but they close too early for a late night beer and grub run  

They have some great specials going on now.  $5 for three sliders, your choice of pork/beef/chicken (I'll take one of each, thank you) . . . and these aren't tiny White Castle size, they're served on the hamburger buns you get at the grocery store.  I'm stuffed.  Add to that the 2 for 1 bottle beer special on everything, even the Negra Modelo?  Nice.  I asked when they normally have that and the girl said always?  Sounds good to me

Sides . . . haven't had many.  Their baked beans have always been good though a tad pricey (most of the sides seemed over priced outside of a combo).  I rarely order fries (but will always bogart one of two of yours if you order them) and they're better than fast food average

What I don't like?  The sauce . . . well, the sauce is decent, but barely a whiff of heat or fire.  It's no surprise the main ingredient is ketchup.  Has nothing on the sauces at Lucille's and Famous Dave's.  Was a nice touch though that they keep a warm kettle crock of it on the counter for us

I've been to HB's a bunch of times, but met with some friends for lunch today.  One ordered the catfish special, and it looked well cooked . . . truly sad that instead of house made tarter sauce they gave him a few fastfood packets of \"tarter sauce\".  All that home cookin', and they can't make a simple fresh tarter sauce?

Overall, still great for some quick BBQ if you're in the area.  I especially like the pulled beef because it seems to hold the smokiness the best, and I love that you can also just buy the meat itself by the pound.  That way you can take a pound or 5 out, then bread and sauce it at home however you like"}
{"text":"My husband and I love the ribs and the pulled meat sandwich trio. Their BBQ sauce is great. My husband has told me that fridays are rib tip day but they are always out when we get there. My negative would be that we Sally do to go orders and three times they've messed it up and that they're always out f rib tips on Friday."}
{"text":"Pulled pork was ok, their sauce was ok too. Cole slaw was the worst I had in my life. I would say it can be described as cheap mayonnaise-like dressing with bits of cabbage."}
{"text":"Large sandwich pork and hot links halfy halfy. Goodness gracious. And this locale has the fries. Enough said."}
{"text":"I've been to both locations and its always a favorite of mine for BBQ. This is one of those nostalgic places to stop in Phoenix. Hot links are nice and spicy and the BBQ is tender with a semi sweet sauce.

Don't let the exterior of either location fool you, just stop and enjoy the flavor!"}
{"text":"Chris Rock once famously quoted...\"how much for 1 rib?\"...well if I had $1.50  to my name, I'd be spending it on just one rib from this place. Honey Bears bar-b-que produces addicts, not frequent customers. My tin foil hat theory is they either A: putting cocaine in the sauce or B: hopping up piggies with opium and serving them to us. Of course these theories are not tru, but I hope you understand how good this food is. 

Ribs is a skill set. This is rib college in Phoenix."}
{"text":"totally disappointed .. so sorry honey bear i was looking to build a brand new relationship with you but you feel totally short ... i ordered pork ribs (the only ribs they sell) ... tougher than I wished, not allot of TLC here.  I ordered hot links and was very disappointed .. hey everybody has their own idea of bbq so to his her own"}
{"text":"Great sliders! Amazing BBQ sauce. I was disappointed when I was there because they were out of sweet potato tater tots, but I hope the next time I go they will be in stock! :)"}
{"text":"I was originally put on to going here by a good friend of mine last year and had forgotten about it until just the other day. I decided to take my girlfriend here on our date night and it was easily the worst decision I had ever made.

When we first arrived, I could tell there was going to be a problem from the get-go. The \"server\", if you can call him that, was sitting in the main part of the restaurant, on his phone, and seemingly begrudged that we had stepped in the restaurant. 

After being unable to give me any direction or recommendations whatsoever, I ordered two BBQ Chicken sandwiches with a potato salad side and a garden salad. 

The food came quickly, but I was quite dissatisfied with it.

To start, the bun was literally too soggy to pick up. The meat was WAY too watery, which I'm sure was the culprit for the soggy buns. When I say soggy buns, I literally mean that my girlfriend's tiny fingers were able to puncture the bread with extreme ease. The sauce was actually quite tasty, and is the only reason that I decided against giving a 1 star review. It wasn't until after I discarded my meal that I figured out more sauce was available behind the drinking fountains (serviced with probably the poorest selection of soft drinks I have ever witnessed). 

Next, my potato salad was literally the most repulsive thing I have ever put in my mouth. I don't know if it was expired or if it was simply the mix you guys use to season it, but you couldn't have paid me to take more than 2 bites out of it.

Lastly, there were fly's hovering around my meal the whole time. I understand you are going for the whole \"barbeque theme\", but when I go to eat at a barbeque restaurant, I'd like to imagine that I am not outdoors in the middle of a night by a buggy swamp. It was literally that bad.

I don't know if this is an isolated incident, or a commonplace thing at Honey Bear's, but I highly doubt I will be back any time soon. I am quite disappointed, because I had always heard such good things about it."}
{"text":"BBQ beef sand w fries & a Fat Tire.  You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"well I went to honey b. and the staff was exactly how the other reviews portrayed them, looks like they are family business own so I will assume that they are brothers, the guy at the register was distracted w his cell phone and also short when I ask for substitute but thats ok, the food was ok nothing that I will refer friends over to go out their way but they are working on the customer service per comm. below and above so that is good."}
{"text":"As stated by other reviewers, Honey Bear's isn't what it used to be.   It's still tasty, but they seem to be giving you a whole lot less for a lot more money.  Add to that the screaming children they have running around lately.   The customer service is still very good.  There are better BBQ places than this."}
{"text":"I had a $20 Groupon for this place, so I decided to try it out on Friday. The food was awesome! The portions were huge too! I had 4 meals for a little over $20. I ordered the half rack ribs with two sides.  I also ordered the beef brisket. The ribs were meaty tender and had good smoky flavor. I typically don't like my ribs swimming in BBQ sauce and was kind of disappointed to see sauce slathered all over the ribs but It worked. I was pleasantly surprised at how tasty they were and the sauce was not overwhelming at all. I ordered a half rack but it seemed that there was a racks worth of ribs (they must be some huge racks)! I will definitely be trying this place again!"}
{"text":"My co-workers seem to love this place.  They often order huge platters for the team.  Cowbro beans, pulled pork, chicken, slaw, hot links, potato salad, mac n cheese, rib tips, and other items.

The cowbro beans are most peoples favorites.  I think the meat is always a bit dry and have to drown it with their sauce.  The sauce is alright.  A little too sweet for my taste.  I like a bit more chile flavor and heat.  The links are pretty tasty.  The mac n cheese is also above average.  The rest is just okay for me.  

It is really hard to find good bbq in AZ.  Crazy as that sounds with all these tranplants out here from all over the country.  You'd think one of them would know how to make some excellent bbq..."}
{"text":"It sure isn't what it used to be when they first opened up.  In '86, I used to go to their first restaurant on E. VanBuren.  Several years after I moved out of the area, I returned and noticed a difference.  That was 20 years ago.  Well, I thought I'd check out their Central Ave location.  Walking in, we smelled methane gas from dried out floor drain traps.  I ordered the wings and had to take them back after two bites.  They were rubbery & flavorless, plus's, the check skin was silvery white which indicates that they were old & probably covered with slime when placed in the deep fryer.  The catfish looked weird but tasted okay.  The serving of Cole slaw looked liked it had been prepacked and was drowning in mayonnaise.  We thought it looked old because it was so smashed down, but, their quantity was plentiful.  The cowboy beans had good taste, but, were nothing like the ones they used to serve which contained plenty of green peppers and hot link slices.  Now, very few green peppers, no onions, and they used hot dog Weiners sparingly.  I asked to replace my wings with a pulled pork sandwich.  Has & Dickey's beat Honey Bear's hands down.  It had a cheap bun which was soggy and smashed down.  They don't even have Coke nor Pepsi products.  The restaurant business is a tough business, so that would explain their reduced quality.  The server/cashier was the best thing about this place.  He was GREAT!"}
{"text":"I am a huge BBQ fan and this place did not disappoint! I have had BBQ at some legit places in Las Vegas (where I am from) but these guys are the best I have had in years! The meat is tender, the sauce is perfect, the sides are amazing, The staff was unique and the inside was cozy and inviting. If you want authentic Tennessee BBQ done right then this will hit the spot for you! I can't wait to visit you next time I come to Phoenix! Thank you for a very yummy experience!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended by the valet at another restaurant. It's just a hole in the wall that we'd have never chosen on our own but we were pleased with the quality and the reasonable price. We had brisket and pork. Both we tender and had good flavor without the bbq sauce. We had potato salad and Mac & Cheese for sides. The sides were larger than expected and were \"homemade\" quality. The Mac & cheese was super creamy and cheesy. The potato salad was a bit mustardy for my taste but was still good."}
{"text":"Ribs were good.  Sides were so-so. Mac n cheese was too runny for my taste. Guy at the counter was new and didnt seems like he had adequate training. I tried to use check in deal (2 dollars off 10) but he was oblivious, and he even called his manager who was oblivious.

points down for terrible service"}
{"text":"I'm writing this post to make sure no one wastes their lunch hour on this place. Although the BBQ is pretty good, it's not exceptional. After spending 20 minutes or so standing in line swatting away flies, there's a good chance that you'll get up to the front and realize that they are out of half of the options on the menu without warning. The location also leaves a lot to be desired. Highly recommend going to Hap's Pit BBQ right down the street instead."}
{"text":"Thanks to my new job, I've got a slew of places to try out now when I go out for lunch on my break! Honey Bear's is one of those places that I decided to drop by.

To be frank, the place could be a little cleaner. But the art and decor on the wall looked like it was orginally set up by the owners and eventually had not been taken care of for a while. The lady taking orders seemed disinterested and disconnected. Tables and walls are kind of sticky.

The Pork and Chicken BBQ sandwich were pretty good, except that it is very very soggy, the bread literally was mush, kinda gross for the bread- but good meats! Warning: Salad is just pure iceberg lettuce! Rip-off. Almost everything is a la carte, I think they just added meal specials so you're not spending so much.

Slightly disappointed but will give them another chance later."}
{"text":"There's not much to say about Honey Bears BBQ...  The food is not as tasty as the smell I sense every early Saturday morning, & it lacks seasoning.  The location is a little sketchy, but is very clean inside the premises and the family staff are very polite.  Personally, the chicken is better than the ribs... But I only went there once & doubt it I will go back..."}
{"text":"It's ok, the meat is bland by itself. With the sauce it taste much better. I tried the pulled chicken and brisket sandwich. There meat by itself is no match for Rudy's.

Would I be willing to go back? Sure, since it's close by."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today with Hubby and a couple of his co-workers. On Thursdays and Fridays they have catfish, so I took the bait. So glad I did- 2 big pieces of perfectly fried catfish- just barely done on the inside and a nice light, crispy, and non-greasy cornmeal exterior. So yummy! The fries were pretty good, too, with a light dusting of a seasoned salt. I tried Hubby's BBQ beef sandwich, and is was just ok. We all liked the zingy BBQ sauce.

Minus one star for a limited menu compared to other BBQ joints (and RC colas) and minus another star for the young employees who acted like they were put out by taking orders. So sorry to interrupt your huddled chit-chat in the corner."}
{"text":"This place seems to be a Valley staple, so I had to try it despite some poor reviews. My experience was pretty good. Ordered two sandwich combos at $9.89 each. Usually don't comment on beverages, but the rare presence of Big Red in the soda machine was one I took advantage of right off the bat. Moving on to the side dishes, the macaroni and cheese was just average, a bit gummy, but the potato salad had large chunks of potatoes and a nice relishy taste. Ok, now onto the main courses. The chopped chicken is just that - 95% white meat chopped onto a bun. So, in this case the BBQ sauce better be good or else it will be one dry sandwich and luckily this sauce was tasty, kind of a thicker red vinegar style, but still a good taste and it gets soaked up fast. The Brisket was another huge sandwich, almost needing a knife and fork as meat spills everywhere (a good thing). This was shredded or chopped style brisket and I even found a few burnt ends buried amongst the meat. Hardly any fat and once again and that sauce made an appearance and \"completed\" the brisket very nicely. Place was pretty empty at 6:30pm on a weekday, just the way I like it."}
{"text":"Honey Bears BBQ is definitely worth checking out. What they lack in variety and options is made up in quality. The ribs were nice and the pork sandwich was tender. Unfortunately I will chose elsewhere next time for more options and a little more meat on the bones. Overall the food was good but nothing wow'd me."}
{"text":"Came to Arizona for a little vacation, I wanted to try something different so we came here. 

This is a Family owned business it was very clean, we were greeted before we even walked in the door by the owner. (Not 100% he was the owner just assuming because he was opening the restaurant) the young man that took our order was nice in greeting us, he even gave my grandfather a free cup as a souvenir haha. Well he ordered a pulled pork sandwich which he loved and inhaled,  I ordered the sliders thinking they are small little sandwiches, I was so wrong these so called sliders were huge! I'm not complaining I was just shocked at how big and filled with meat they were! I was only able to finish one, the Pulled pork was really good. The sauce it self was a lil too tangy to my liking. My only advice would be to the young man behind the counter, Smile! I felt like I was a bother when I asked for a box and a bag to go. His face expression said it all.."}
{"text":"Some of the best around. I hadn't been to Honey Bears in years but stoped in for chicken and ribs.

They are still awsome and the slaw is spot on. The chicken was moist and flavofull. Dont be put off by the location or looks it is good food! And has been for years."}
{"text":"Literally watched the guy throw my hot links for my sandwich in the DEEP FRYER. 'Nuff said. Fool me once....."}
{"text":"Cute little BBQ joint!  I mean who doesn't love bears and an adorable catering van parked outside?  Reminds of smokey the bear actually and I'd almost  imagine smokey bear looking at honey bear warning not to start forest fires when bbqing.  Anyways, on to the review!  Fast food style BBQ- I ordered the 3 slider combo which is great so you can try all theme meats.  I liked the pulled pork the best although it's a little on the dry side.  The sauce is awesome and does a great job masking any noticeable dryness if you spread it out.  You also get a side (can't go wrong with Mac n cheese) that comes in a to go container which is great if you can't finish all your food.  I love the fact that the place is family owned and it's a great atmosphere in the establishment with several historically meaningful pictures of it.  The garbage system needs an update as the hole to actually dump garbage is tiny and causes sauce to spill all over the sides and for customers to actually put effort in aiming their disposal of goods."}
{"text":"I have had a Yelp account for 4 years and this is my first review,

We had attended the Southwest Cajun Festival today in downtown Chandler as we love Cajun and Southern cooking. While walking down the crowded streets looking for the next place to try we spot the Honey Bears Banner, the banner reads, Honey Bears, Gumbo, Jambalaya, Boudin, Etouffee, wish I would have taken a picture. As you can imagine the lines are 30-50 people long and you get in line about 50 feet away from the stand, so we decide to give them a try. 

Lines at all the places were long so we expected this and discussed what food we liked so far and what we still would like to try, as well explained to my wife what Boudin was. 

So after about 15-20 mins we finally worked our way up to the counter. Once at the counter we were greeted, what would you like, I quickly said I would love a bowl of Gumbo, and we will try the Boudin as well. The attendant replied, we don't have those items! With my puzzled look I asked what do you mean? The sign above my head reads Gumbo, Boudin, etc. The attendant then points to a small sign at the opposite end of the stand and sarcastically said these are the items we have. I then replied but you cannot see that sign walking by or standing in line, you should probably fix that, and the attendant replied well maybe you should learn how to read! 

Restraining myself we walked away, this was the first and last time I will ever think about eating at Honey Bears."}
{"text":"The outside of the building is in extraordinarily horrible shape. For starters, the owner of the business must be a cheap and evil person. It looks like they are purposely trying to bring down the property value of the whole block! The place has paint cracking, tables and chairs that shake and move when you use them, and there is an overall ambiance of despair and hopelessness when you are near the building. The owner truly should commit himself to a mental institution. While he is making a great return on his investment, the owner apparently has a business strategy that is focused on keeping the building looking like a piece of crap while he pockets the money that needs to be re-invested in the building. He doesn't give a damn about the surrounding businesses, the city of Phoenix, or his customers. None of my coworkers will eat at this establishment because of the appearance of the place. We work literally across the street. 

Message to owner: Way to think about yourself instead of your community by pocketing all the money that should go towards making your POS BBQ shack look like a place a non-hobo would frequent. 

On a separate note: The food is great! 9/10 for everything on the menu. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Something is up at the Tempe Honey Bears, and it's not good.  I've eaten here for years, and at their Phoenix location, and previously at their South Tempe location (now closed). Food and service have always been excellent.  On my last visit, the place does not appear to be run by the family who has delivered excellent food and service for the past several decades. I ordered my usual Rib & Chicken combo with 2 sides.  The chicken was OK, but the ribs were seriously undercooked and underseasoned.  This was a huge disappointment!  As with most BBQ places, the ribs are supposed to be, juicy, flavorful and fall-off-the-bone tender.  It's something I look forward to when indulging at a place like this.  The hispanic staff (including a very young kid) who were running the place were unfriendly and slow.  There are lots of BBQ joints in town now, several closer to home, but I've been a loyal fan of Honey Bears for a long time.  I hope they can get their act back together."}
{"text":"Did the Yelp check in coupon for $2 off.  The guy looks at the screen and says \"Yeah we don't take those anymore.\"  No prob...I just walked out and did the one star review from the parking lot.  The good news is that you saved $2...hope it was worth it."}
{"text":"I just went here for dinner with my gf and a friend using a couple of Groupons we had. I've also had it recommended to me by a few people previously. 

Location: It's like any other place on Central- the location itself isn't that sketchy but everything around it is. The inside is a pretty standard Mom-and-Pop simple decor. Dining area was pretty clean and employees were walking around regularly to make sure it stayed that way. Trashcans had those annoying small-circle opening tops on them and made discarding your refuse without getting crud from previously discarded trash on your hands a task. Men's bathroom was cramped but clean. 

Food: I had the brisket, pulled pork, and Cowbro' beans. Brisket was alright; I've had better and I've had worse. It could've used a bit more smoking/more intense smoking but the sauce complemented it well. Pulled pork was good- about on par with any other decent pulled pork. It had a nice balance of flavor between the meat and smoke and was also complemented well by the sauce. The sauce is a low-viscosity variety with a great balance of sweet and spicy. The sweetness was just enough to draw out some extra meaty flavors in the brisket and pork without overpowering it. The spiciness was just enough to complement the other flavors, keep the taste-buds excited, but not too spicy by any means. The Cowbro' beans were actually pretty amazing. They seemed like a standard canned-base with other seasonings added, which made them taste infinitely better than canned. The beans also had chunks of smoked sausage in them, which I felt was a nice touch. The sausage had good flavor and a crisp casing. 

My girlfriend had a pulled pork sandwich, ribs, and mac n' cheese. She thought the ribs were \"alright,\" a fairly standard rib. She enjoyed the mac n' cheese and was too full to touch the sandwich so it came home with us. 

My friend had the chicken sandwich, mac n' cheese, and peach cobbler. She thought the chicken sandwich tasted good but was a little dry (and it did look a bit dry from across the table). She thought the mac n' cheese was alright but that she'd had much better. She enjoyed the cobbler but felt the filling was oddly watery and regretted not ordering it a la mode. 

Staff: Friendly, attentive. 

Summary: If I'm in the mood for barbecue, it will certainly be on my list of places to go to if I happen to be in the mood to drive to Central."}
{"text":"I used to go to the location on EVB; been going to Honey Bear's since the early 90's...Love Honey Bears; it's great they are in Central PHX (closer to me now); I see they have Greens on the menu (but, they were out yesterday)...Will be back; for the Fried Chicken (on Wednesdays) & some Greens...Also, wish they had Fried Green Tomatoes..."}
{"text":"Love this place. Their meats are cooked to perfection, the sauces are fantastic, and their sides are soooooo yummy. We come here a lot to get food to go, and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"After my utterly-disappointing BBQ roll through KC, I realized just how much I appreciate Honey Bear's.  Never had a bad meal here.  The Cowbro beans are delicious.  The meat is always lean and usually juicy.  The sauce is as good as any, if you like BBQ sauce with a little kick.  Everyone hating because this isn't like a BBQ place back in (insert famous BBQ town here) is just funny to me.  \"It's not real BBQ unless (327-point checklist of real BBQ)...\"  Whatever.  I love this place."}
{"text":"How many ways can you spell DISAPPOINTED!!!!! I have had better BBQ on a HUNGRY MAN DINNER. 

I had a friend in from Chicago this evening who was staying at the ALOFT by the airport. I wanted to impress him with the BBQ at HB's as he has taken me to some really great places in Chicago. This HB's was the first one I had eaten at when I first arrived in PHX. I last ate here 2 years ago when I was on Van Buren and the food was great!!!! What Happened???

We arrived at about 7:45. When we walked in both men were texting on their cell phones and did not really seem to care much about anything else. The person working the counter a tall man of ethnic origin was kind of aloof and on the rude side. I got the BBQ Chicken and my guest got the BBQ Pulled Pork. Total Cost: $19.63 which BTW was a great year. The food was out in 5 minutes so you know a lot of care was taken in the cooking and preparation. The Chicken did not taste fresh. It was soft and moist like it should be but it tasted like a reheat from 2 days past. Presentation was HORRIBLE! My friends pulled pork sandwich was served on a white hamburger bun and the sauce saturated it so much that he could not hold it to eat it. The bun should have at least been toasted.

I was extremely embarrassed as my friend threw more than half of it away.

In the not so distant past I ate at the Honey Bears on Elliot and Priest.  It is close to my home and the food was consistently good and we went every other month. I guess every chain has a BRONZE store and I guess HB's on 5012 E Van Buren St Phoenix, AZ 85008 is the B@$T@RD child of the chain.

My advice....try someplace else where they want your business and serve FRESH food.

I am Jeff and I call em as I see em!

BTW if you are handicapped they have a ramp but the parking lot is so uneven and has course asphalt, it is a major trip/fall hazard."}
{"text":"3 star average (4 stars for the BBQ sandwiches, 2 stars for everything else)
I've been to Honey Bear's a couple times because I really like their Chicken BBQ sandwiches, and I'm told the pork ones are very good too. Unfortunately, it's not an enjoyable place to dine. Although each time I\"ve gone there are plenty of tables to choose from as it's never busy, it's lucky if you find a clean one. The combination of dirty tables and the demeanor of the employees just gives me a feeling of being unwelcome, like I better hurry to eat and run. My other issue with Honey Bear's is the price. It would be nice if the sandwhiches came with a small side. Speaking of which, the fries aren't bad, but nothing to rave about either.
If you are looking for take out or catering, I definitely recommend the food.  Just don't come here for the ambiance :)"}
{"text":"I would agree that this place is a 3 star restaurant for sure. No paper towels in the men's room. NO BEEF?!?!??!! For real?! I mean, how can you call yourself a BBQ place, if you don't even have BEEF. I mean, last time I checked there was no National Beer Shortage. The pork was a little bland but the BBQ sauce was good. The chicken was OK, but made the bun soggy, and not from the sauce. And the potato salad was ok. We will probably not visit again, unless we have to."}
{"text":"Manager (Owner?) is very chill... Some people might not be used to it. It's a southern thing though! Lol... Anyways! The food is good, I always get either the pulled pork sandwich or the hot link sandwich. The BBQ is the ish!!!!!! I love it, can't get enough. I was reading some other reviews & all I can say is Love it or hate it, I happen to love it. PS: it's really not as bad as people make it seem... Give it a try."}
{"text":"Awesome BBQ restaurant!

I have been to Honey Bears many times and I will definitely be back. The BBQ is great and the service is good too. I recommend stopping by on a Friday for the fresh fried catfish. So good! You know the are making some crazy good food because the lines at there catering events are never ending!

{"text":"First time in Arizona and boy was this place a miss. Nothing barbecue about this place the meat taste boiled drenched in watery bbq sauce. Maybe it was because it was almost time for closing . The portion size was not even worth what i paid not to mention bread is dry and cold. Big miss"}
{"text":"I am a BBQ fan.  I smoke my own meats at home and am constantly looking at BBQ places to compare and contrast and to get new ideas.

Since I moved to Phoenix two years ago, many have said Honey Bear's BBQ was the place to go.  I have been twice now.

The first time I got a platter selection of ribs, pulled pork, pulled brisket and chicken.  The most remarkable point was how dry and old the chicken seemed.  had I gotten there too early to be served yesterday's reheated chicken?  The sides were just OK.  the store is beaten down with laminated booths and a dark interior.  Maybe built in 1979 and never remodeled.

This week i went again and got just a pulled brisket sandwich.  the brisket was good, tender and moist.  It came with sauce already added, i would have preferred to add my own quantity of sauce.  the bun was a simply white bread roll, nothing special.  The sweet potato tater tots were OK, not as tasty as I had hoped.  The coleslaw was average.  

1 Star for BBQ
1 star for a successful pulled brisket sandwich.

If Booby-Q was closer, i would be heading there for lunch instead of Honey Bear's BBQ.

PS - they were busy at lunch, so there must be some fans around."}
{"text":"I was really not impressed with the BBQ here. I decided to go because I read others' reviews and most of them said the food was good but my experience wasn't as fortunate, I guess. 

I ordered the ribs and chicken combo plate with greens and Mac and cheese for my son and I. The chicken was very dry, just slathered in sauce. I nor my son wanted to eat it. The ribs were inconsistent. Some were tasty and moist; others extremely dry and chewy. None of them were fall off the bone good. It may be because they weren't freshly made (when I went in there was NOBODY in there and while I was there about an hour only one other customer came in). 

My greens needed salt and lacked the savory taste that greens should give. My mac and cheese was just...not right. I tried saving it at home but it was unsalvageable. But in their defense I am very particular about my Mac and cheese. 

Also, there were no options for non-carbonated drinks; not even sweet tea! I don't appreciate that. And they were out of cornbread."}
{"text":"I would not recommend Not the Honey Bears I remember, counter service sucks. No more bar. If you like eating off a piece of aluminum foil this place is great, if you want a plate and utensils its $1.75 per person more. Beer was cheap and cold at 2.75 for a bud lite. Sides were nice and hot but the brisket was cold and the bun was as cheap as you can get. The corn on the Cobb was hot but old. Beans were good, as was the Mac and cheese. The brisket was not tasty at all bbq sauce was runny and tasteless over all I would not recommend coming to honey bears $30 bucks for two brisket sandwich with two sides and two beers."}
{"text":"Oooohh the good food we find in the ghettooooo!! 

So yeah, when I moved to Az I didn't really know anyone, so of course I had no idea which areas were near 'bad', and which were closer to 'good'. I moved about 3 blocks away from Honey Bear's, and truthfully this place saved me a few times. Sure, it's on a street famous for hookers and activity deemed less than savory by most, but the bbq is solid. 

Parking is ample and the staff is as down home as the bbq they dish out. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"2 Stars is a compliment. I work nearby and have eaten here several times over the past 10+ years and every time it just seems to get worse and worse. I went today after about a year away and this will be the last time I ever eat there. 

Portion sizes are much smaller than I remember, buns were soggy, styrofoam cups make your drink taste like crap...only about 4 drink choices to begin with. The place smelt like an old Burger King and food was over priced. 

I went in craving some good BBQ and left very disappointed. I would've settled for some decent BBQ but it doesn't seem like they can even muster that anymore."}
{"text":"Dirty. Old. I was very concerned about the food I ate.

We got a pound of brisket. It was dry, had little flavor, covered in a watery bbq sauce. Not good at all. We ate about 3/4 of it and threw the rest away.

Several customers appeared to be using this location as temporary housing."}
{"text":"I always thought this was the first Honey Bears on the scene. Turns out it is not. IT is still a great one though. I know it has been here for as long as I can remember. It is a cool place and not a bad location at all.
It smells really good when you walk inside.
They give you a lot of food for your order. No doubt about that.
I had the Chicken,BBQ. I do not love Chicken. But, this was pretty good I have to say.
We got some to go as well. The Cole Slaw was pretty tasty as well ,and seemed really fresh.
I like the sause here,you can even get it to go. Meaning that you can buy bottles of it to take home.
Parking is around the back and a little tight. But, I like anything that is old Phoenix and this is it!"}
{"text":"I dined here last week and had a half platter of ribs.  Some ribs had minimal meat and were dry.  Some ribs were great.  The BBQ sauce is a tangy red sauce.

Food I would rate a \"3\", I've had better, but it's not bad.

Location - this place was dirty and there was spilled BBQ on the floor near the cash register.  The cashier was aware of the spill but didn't clean it up promptly as she had to warn me to watch my step.  Another customer was complaining to them in Spanish on how they messed up his order.

Service/Cleanliness: 1.
 
Overall - this place deserves a 2.

Who would like this place?  Someone who's gotta have BBQ and nothing else serving BBQ nearby - it will do."}
{"text":"I have avoided this place for so long because SO many people have told me this place sucks for BBQ...but guess what?! THEY WERE WRONG.

I got the spare ribs meal with mac and cheese, and a side of corn bread. While they did forget to give me my $1.50 cornbread and I checked my order before leaving thinking the bread in the aluminum foil was corn bread but it was more like a King's Hawaiian roll, I did enjoy my meal!

The mac and cheese was creamy and in a large portion. The spare ribs were cooked thoroughly and soft so the meat came right off the bone. The BBQ sauce could have been thicker and perhaps spicier, but overall I still loved the taste of the sauce. The service was great, quick, and they were very kind.

Overall, I'd definitely eat here again and I don't know why people keep saying this place is that bad. It's a lot better than other places I have tried to find BBQ at in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Delicious! Ribs, chicken, mac and cheese! It's all so good!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Chicken BBQ sandwich...was not that great. The chicken meat lacked any flavor. And the bread of the sandwich was extremely mushy. Plus, no sides and no kid options!! Just FYI..."}
{"text":"As of 10/06/2012, I am sadened to report that Honey Bear's BBQ on Elliot and Priest has shut down. Not sure when, not sure why, but the doors are closed, the chairs are stacked, and the sign has been removed. I am aware there are 2 other locations in the valley(one on central and one on east van buren), but I hope they reemerge in the east valley."}
{"text":"One word.  GROSS.  

I went there last night with my daughter, and we had a Groupon.  It was the day before it expired, and I'm sure they had been inundated with them for the last 3 or 4 days.  So of course when I told her I had a Groupon, the girl at the front counter was nice enough to roll her eyes at me, and of course I told her \"I see you roll your eyes at me\".  So she told me because they had so many of  these coupons.  Great start.  

I got the sliders, a pork, a beef, and a chicken.  My daughter got a bbq beef sandwich.  For our sides we got macaroni and cheese and french fries.  Megan's sandwich was wrapped in foil, and was barely warm, probably because the foil had kept in the the little amount of heat that there was.  My sandwiches were cold, I mean cold to the touch, the meat and the buns, and they were not wrapped in foil.   I took them up to the eye roller and told her to put them in the microwave for a minute, and she did.  French fries were ok, a little salty.   Mac and cheese was very good, at least there was that.  The meat on the sandwiches was dry and tasteless.  I brought a couple of them home and fed them to my dogs and cats.  

I had been to this Honey Bears a long time ago, and remember I didn't like it.  Now I remember why, it was frankly, gross.   Even with a coupon, seriously, I would never go back there.  But if you do, say hi to the eye roller for me."}
{"text":"As someone who loves barbeque, I was very excited to try Honey Bear's BBQ.  Unfortunately, the Honey Bear's experience was only so-so.  The food was mediocre.  The sauce was fine, but nothing to write home about.  I will return some day in the future, but I am in no hurry to do so.  For now, I'll stick to some of the other BBQ gems of the Valley."}
{"text":"OMG what happened to this place?  We hadn't been here in awhile, but the brisket was overcooked and soupy.  The links had no taste except were very spicy.  If the brisket at Dallas and Austin airports rate an 8, then this is a definite one or two.  They say your first instincts are best; we first went into the Philly sub place next door that had Coke products and walked out.  Instead we had overcooked, tasteless brisket and RC soda and spent $30 for two.  I was even going save some for the dogs, but I wouldnt have enough padding for the explosion that would cause.   Thank God I have a good cigar to get the taste out!!!"}
{"text":"This place is just ok.  I got a 1/2 pound of the brisket and a side of corn.  Not much to write about.  It's a hole-in-the-wall BBQ place with average food."}
{"text":"Honey Bear's is a place that was at one point a celebrated BBQ establishment, but it is now only a shell of its supposed former greatness.  The setup and quality are fast food, but the prices are a notch higher.  The meat tastes alright, but nothing special.  The restaurant itself is a bit of a dive (although the Central Ave. location is nicer, it is considerably more crowded).  The portions are meager.  All of this leaves you with the feeling that it would be a good $5 lunch.  Unfortunately, it's not just $5."}
{"text":"Why, oh why, do I keep giving Honey Bears a chance?  We were about to go to Happs' for lunch, and for some reason, I suggested Honey Bears.  Now Happs' is not great BBQ, but I am still regretting my decision to skip them today.  My coworker called Honey Bears an 8.5.  8.5!

So, what is wrong with Honey Bears?  Well, here it is in a nutshell: $11 for an extremely greasy pulled pork sandwich, some beans, and a bad fountain root beer.  I opened my sandwich up no more than 30 seconds after it was wrapped, and the entire bottom half of the bun was so soaked that half the meat came out during my futile attempt to pick it up.

The beans, well they were pretty good.  I've already mentioned the root beer, though.

One of my coworkers got the sliders, and they also had that soaked bun problem, and not nearly as much meat as the picture depicted.

When a restaurant has a menu as limited as Honey Bears', they darn well better do a good job on each dish.  If the food were reasonably priced, I'd say it's the McDonald's of BBQ... But you're paying almost as much as you'd pay at Famous Dave's, without anywhere near the quality."}
{"text":"Have been going to this place/location for YEARS!! Needless to say, I wont be back to this establishment ever again, after I discovered a CLUMP of hair (view in photos at own risk) in my pulled pork. Highly disappointed."}
{"text":"Lunch at Honey Bears BBQ today. Arrived at 11:15 with four parties seated and three in line in front of me - good sign. 

I ordered the BBQ pork, hot link, a side of slaw and a drink. He changed it to the # 1 value meal to save me money but it still came to $10.28. 

Meal arrived in about 4 minutes and everything was hot but I was disappointed in most of it. Come slaw first: slaw was tangy, perfect spice and mayo level. Definitely would order again. 

The pork and link came together in a HB bun. I got 2-3 ounces of pork and a three-inch link. Decent flavor but for $10, I should get more than 2-3 oz.

The link was good. It had good snap, excellent spice but just not much of it. 
The meal came with a pint of BBQ sauce which was unexpected. The sauce had a slight amount of spice but was so sweet I couldn't put much on the Sammie. I suppose when you're called Honey BBQ, you make sweet sauce. 

Around the corner is Hap's BBQ which I thought was better but Famous Dave's blows them both out with flavor and value."}
{"text":"Decent food but the counter service sucks. The guy running the register seemed to have a chip on his shoulder and was irritated at every question I asked. When I drop over $40 for lunch , it would be nice to get a \"thank you\" or \"have a nice day\" but you'll get none of that here. I felt very unwelcome here so I will not be back."}
{"text":"Wow, simply unbelievably good barbecue this far west!  The beans are the best this Texan ever tasted, meat and sauce both outstanding!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a while but not like I remember it. Quality of the food not that great anymore, very disappointed. Restroom and restaurant not clean at all."}
{"text":"Foods pretty good. Counter staff is horrible. We have been here 4 times in the last month and I am completely unsatisfied with the staff. The collard greens are very good. It would be nice if the staff matched the food."}
{"text":"I hadn't in this restaurant for a few years because the sauce had a lot of vinegar in it years ago.  I don't know what they did but the sauce is now some very good stuff, the lunch time business seems very good.  a co-worker wanted to go so we did and I was very surprised at how good the sauce was,  we had barbeque beef and pork sandwiches.  I haven't made it on rib tip day (Friday) or chicken wing day, Wednesday,  I think.  I will review again when I have had the oportunity to try those and other menu items."}
{"text":"Had bbq pork sandwich.  It was good, but over priced. No lids for your soda? Wth? Wish they served fries instead of potato chips."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place since I really dig family owned businesses I guess I will start my review by saying I ordered via phone but when I called I got an automated system that was horrible and didn't route you to anyone instead it said to call another number. After placing a huge order they said it would be done in 30 minutes. I went to pick up my order an hour later and it was still not ready and ended up waiting another 30 minutes when I looked around it seemed that everyone there was waiting for food and no food was being served in a timely matter. After finally getting my food I really wasn't impressed. 

Pulled Pork-Dry
Brisket-Dry
Sauce-Weak and needed spice
Baked Beans-Very good especially with the sausage 
Hot Links- Not bad but not spicy
Coleslaw- Very good 
Corn Bread- bland and tasted old"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why, but their barbeque sauce doesn't ring true for me.  There seems to be a slight watery tang there that shouldn't be..  So just 3 stars for me, but I LOVE their beans!  If I had my way, I'd get beans from there and get the meat from somewhere else..  :\"}
{"text":"Omg I'm at junk in the truck festival and just the smell drew me in!! And it tastes better then it smell! Definitely going back to the van Buern location!"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try a new place tonight. I usually love barbecue, and when he suggested we try Honey Bears, I was more than happy to. First of all, I have to admit, I worked for Famous Dave's years ago and although I couldn't stand being employed there, they had some darn good barbecue and I'd still go eat there if there was one closer by. So maybe my expectations were too high for Honey Bears, but they fell way short. 

I got the pork brisket sandwich. I couldn't even pick it up, the bun was so soggy. Like snot. I tried to pick it up and it just disintegrated and all the meat fell out. I ate it with a fork, seeing as I was too starving to send it back. The meat was very moist and tender until I got a huge bite of the nastiest, driest chunk of meat. Like hard and chewy beef jerky. I have never discourteously spit food out of my mouth before, but that was too unpleasant to swallow! 

Moving on, the fries were good. The beans were awesome! The bbq sauce was lacking in consistency and flavor. The cheese in the mac was a bit thin. The ribs I had that came with their combo 3, well one was alright, the other one was almost all fat. 

All in all, I didn't \"hate\" it but I'm not going back. There are better places to spend my money."}
{"text":"Food was great. Macaroni noodles were maybe a little over cooked. I would stay away from the chicken was a bit dry. The pork is the best choice. Tall, bald, older man who seemed to be a manager was rude not only to me and other customers but I heard him chew out the bus boy.  I would go back but maybe a different hour in hopes to avoid the rude cashier/manager."}
{"text":"Service could be a lot more better , couldn't tell who worked there or not since it looked like they just pulled in people off the street and asked them to work that day , well that's the feel i got when I glanced back into the kitchen . My boyfriend and I got 2 #1 which was a sandwich with one side and a drink , I got pork he got chicken , both were a bit dry until you added that sauce which was DELISH , as I walked up to the counter to grab our order to go , I noticed all the guys had gathered up front to , you guessed it , check me out right In front of my boyfriend. Other than that , our food was alright , nothing really stood out or caught my attention besides the BBQ sauce ."}
{"text":"Not a fan of this location. Ordered the pork sandwich and the bread was stale. Van Buren location is much better."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved it, the meat was tender, smokey, and the BBQ wasn't overwhelming so you can actually appreciate the flavors. Rib meat came off the bone with ease. Brisket was awesome and so was the pulled pork."}
{"text":"Pretty good BBQ for Phoenix!  I enjoyed the pulled pork sandwich with a side of mac 'n cheese...quite tasty!  The atmosphere is not very appealing and the advertising is quite cheesy, but guess it did make me laugh!"}
{"text":"You know. I really don't have much to say about this place that is bad. I've been there a number of times and have also had their catering.

Their beans are very good. Slightly sweet with the right amount of spice.
Hot links are spot on. Pulled beef and pork sandwiches are good, but the meat could be more tender. I am very picky about my potato salad, but theirs isn't bad."}
{"text":"Not sure I understand the poor reviews.  Previous to last night I'd only had Honey Bears samples from Beer Fests in Phoenix and have had no complaints.

Well last night during a First Friday reconnaissance mission we chose to go for a late dinner.  Walking in is pretty much a time warp to the 70s/80s when things didn't need to be glitzy.  You walk up to the counter, order and you can get either a sandwich or by the pound.  We ordered Corn on the cobb, 1/2 lb of pork, and cowboy beans.

The order came up in five minutes and we sat down.  The Beans were spicy and perfect, pork and sauce solid.  Smart choice."}
{"text":"Always get the shredded pork to go with coleslaw and beans to make my own BBQ salad at home. Geat BBQ 25cent wing night on Mondays..grilled!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a while and man has this place gone down the tubes. Took a long time to order and get our lunch as only one person working here. Drink machine was a disaster. Only 2 dispensers worked and they were out of ice. Very limited choice.
We both ordered brisket sandwiches which were dry and not very tasty. Sandwiches were a lot smaller than I remember..
Sure won't be returning. Not the Honey Bears I grew up with. Very disappointing. The place has become a dump."}
{"text":"Good BBQ chicken, okay pumpkin pie, and where are the yams, sweet potatoes, and other traditional BBQ stuff? Oh wrong directions on yelp's behalf didn't help either."}
{"text":"last weekend after some shopping my wife and I decided to get some bbq and since we where near downtown phoenix decided to stop at HONEY BEARS BBQ  what a mistake, do these people even know what barbecue is, if you plan on goin there you better pack a lunch bag the wait for your mediocre bbq is ridiculous and the people that work there seemed like they all had a bad day, there is a sign that says for you to check your order before you leave when we did some food was missing it took 3 of the employees to agree that our order was not complete so we had to wait longer to get our whole order, will we go back \"HELL NO\" you can try it if you like crappy food"}
{"text":"Pulled pork and coleslaw was AWESOME!  Corn on the cob was terrible.  Sauce for dipping pork was tasty!  Pretty rude guy behind the counter... SUCKED...  He looked like he wanted to punch someone out!  He didn't really say anything rude, but I deffinetly felt like I was WASTING his time.  I will go back for sure.  They are about to update the table tops! ;o)"}
{"text":"Love the food here. This location specifically I think is better than the other location. The mac n cheese is amazing and the pulled chicken sandwiches are very big. Staff is typically friendly but the booths aren't very comfortable."}
{"text":"The food is always great. Very good BBQ Pork that has plenty of smokey flavor and the sauce compliments it well.

The employees on the other hand have a terrible attitude and never smile. They never say \"thank you\". I definitely recommend going to the Van Buren location because this one does not make you feel appreciated for your business.

I would have given them lower if I didn't know what their true standards are from my consistent patronage at the other locations."}
{"text":"Food here was great, I had a bad experience in tempe but this place was great!"}
{"text":"Well I am in Phoenix for business and this place is walking distance down the street and since I am a major BBQ-aholic had to give it a try.  Went here for lunch before the lunch crowd came pouring in.  Tasty - I had the pork sandwich with a side of slaw.  All good contenders - nothing too outstanding but definitely solid.  I like the sauce."}
{"text":"The food is excellent, and the sauce is the best I have ever had. The dining area is run-down, and the restrooms are dirty. The maintenance is not done well. The employees are not rude, but they are not friendly either. They do not make the customers feel welcome. I like to support this business because they decorate for Christmas using Christian symbols, rather than just decorate for generic \"holidays\"."}
{"text":"Hands down the worst BBQ I have ever had. I ordered the brisket sandwich. The meat doesn't taste smoked at all. It has a high fatty content. It was served with the sauce already on it (not a wrong practice, but better to allow the customer to put the amount of sauce they are comfortable with), and the sauce was horrible. It was like aged ketchup. Also the bun was soggie half way through my meal due to the sauce and grease content. On top of that it was over $7 just for the sandwich. Why would I go back? I won't. Don't waste your money here unless they do some serious soul searching as to why they are in business. Obviously it is not what they are good at.

Alternatives are Dickeys, Ralph's, joe's real BBQ, or famous dave's."}
{"text":"Great BBQ and sides plus reasonable prices and service I will go back"}
{"text":"Best BBQ I've had this side of the Mississippi river. They also cater sporting events and concerts. They had a big tent set up at the Mesa amphitheater for a blues concert and they didn't gouge you for a sandwich and drink like most venues will."}
{"text":"Hmmm... just having read all the reviews so far...I'm wondering if I liked this place as much as I think I did. I do recall the BBQ sauce being a little but too spicy for my taste but I think overall I really liked my BBQ sandwich I ate at Honey Bear's...or wait... did I have the ribs? Shoot... I think I had both! It wasn't my favorite but it was good and I'd go back again, but I don't know BBQ like some of you reviewers know BBQ...so maybe I'm not the best review to take into consideration."}
{"text":"Marie and I decided to do a little shopping today so we drove across I-10 from Ahwatukee to Tempe to check out Ikea and Costco.  After strolling through each of the big stores and not buying anything that could spoil in the heat of the car, we stopped at Honey Bear's BBQ for a late afternoon lunch/dinner.

We've eaten here once before having a good tasting pulled pork sandwich with sides, but this second time we both had a hankering for some pork ribs.  In my usual style, I ordered a full rack with a two sides of potatoes, one fries and the other potato salad. Marie decided to have 1/2 rack of ribs with two sides, cole slaw and a corn on the cob.  She also has a beer and I went with a RC cola.

Now my thing with Honey Bear's is with the staff.  They are nice to you, take your order quickly, but they are a bit stoic, standoffish.  And this could be just me, but I feel like they need reassurance that I know a bit about BBQ, like I need to say \"Hey I'm experienced! I've traveled this great country and have eaten BBQ in Kansas City, St. Louis, Chicago, Memphis, Virginia and some back woods joint in South Carolina.\" Like I said, this is most likely my personal issues coming out, but this is how I feel while I'm ordering our meal.  Everything came to about $40.00 with small tip.

We scoop up some extra BBQ sauce, which is very tasty, not over powering, IMHO.  Takes about 10 minutes to assemble our order.  When it comes to the counter, I'm already in motion and on my way before the guy can say our number.  The tray has way more ribs then either of us can eat in one sitting.  

We both dig in with our hands, lifting the ribs to our faces dripping in their excellent BBQ sauce and begin to pull the meat from the bone with our teeth.  Now on their soda cups Honey Bear's states and I quote \"You don't need no teeth...to eat our meat.\" They may mean the pulled pork, but I found that the meat didn't fall off the bone; you did need teeth to pry the meat from the bone of these ribs.  The meat is dry, tasty but dry.  That didn't stop me from finishing off all but four of my full rack plus the fries and potato salad.  I love the potato salad, with its taste of pickles.  Mmmmm.  Except for two pieces, my girl stripped her ribs clean.

Marie got a \"to go\" box from the counter woman, and we piled in my leftovers to take home for a late night snack."}
{"text":"You want a big wad of sticky drippy animal on a bun? Well, you're in the right place. it sounds like the other location has more selection of sides. Why not here? This place is lacking. Bring me the home fries!! The sauce was too watery for me, but flavorful. I just wish it stuck to the meat better and didn't get soaked up by the bun. The potato salad was yummy (rather peppery), but I've had better."}
{"text":"Been going here since I was a littls kid. Never had any problems. Always good food... BBQ :)"}
{"text":"Got a family meal deal for home consumption.  Two slabs of ribs had plenty of meat on them (not baby back, but pork), came chopped up.  Two adults and 2 kids, despite gorging ourselves, only ate about 75%.  Their sauce is frankly exceptional.

But the sides... well... sucked.

The corn was watery (they must soak in hot water for a day or two).  The potato salad, while having the skin of red potatos and being pretty decent, had a strong dill taste that I liked but I couldn't get kids or wife to enjoy.  The rolls aren't good... but most aren't at these kinds of places.

What pissed me off the most was that they forgot one of the sides... mac and cheese.

Anyway, here's what i got out of the deal.. I will come back for the ribs.  And WILL absolutely come back for the sauce.  In fact, I may just come get a tub of sauce and BBQ my own ribs if I'm not feeling particularly lazy.  

Meat = Good
Sides = Bad
Sauce = Exceptional (5 Stars)

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"It's good if you need a quick fix, otherwise I would go elsewhere. The quality of the food is excellent, don't get me wrong (their ribs are my go-to), I'm just not a fan of their sauces. Their BBQ beans are a must however and the cornbread muffins are amazing when they're fresh!"}
{"text":"Not what it used to be and I don't mean the IHOP that used to be there. Food quality has really taken a dive compared to 15 years ago. I don't know if it was ownership and/or management that stopped caring, but I wouldn't put up with the light rail destruction of a functional road to come back here. Plenty of other places that are good and where I can turn left to leave or turn left to enter."}
{"text":"This place isn't what it used to be.  I have fond memories of coming here as a kid and ordering fall-off-the-bone baby back ribs and delicious sides.  Coming here today, I was kinda disappointed. Not only to learn that they no longer serve babyback ribs and only serve spareribs now, but to learn that a good portion of them are overcooked or less tender. The corn has gotten bland, but the Mac and cheese was good. The only reason my review is 2 stars as opposed to 1 is the Mac and cheese."}
{"text":"All the food was amazing - we made the mistake of ordering extra hot bbq sauce. It is no joke! it was delicious but had us all sweating and with runny noses. Ordered lunch for a group of 13. All the orders were correct. Love this place"}
{"text":"I wouldn't say that overall, this is the best BBQ place in the valley but for what I get there, its the best. I have tried their pulled pork sammich and was not overly impressed. However, what I am impressed with is their hot link sammich, BBQ beans, and their corn on the cob. The hot links are juicy and spicy, the beans are thick and have lots of meat in them, and the corn is actually a large ear of corn that doesn't taste like the frozen kind. The sauce is very good as well. When I want a simple BBQ sammich and a few sides, this is one of the places I think of."}
{"text":"The ribs were delicious!!  Finally a place that the sauce was so good that I would buy a bottle.  The sides too me were nasty (potato salad and cow beans) .  I would buy ribs from here and go to Mrs.Whites for the sides to make the perfect meal."}
{"text":"I ordered a beef brisket sandwich with a side of Cowbro beans and collard greens for a total of $11.92(not including a drink) I had my own bottled water. 
The first thing I found very tacky about this place is that I paid with my bank debit/credit card and the cashier system this place used is a swipe on a Airpad. Once swiped it's then turned around to me with an option to tip %15 %20 or %25 or decline. I just find this totally tacky that there's an option to tip the cashier or whoever it goes to for merely ringing up my order. (Just doesn't make sense to me but,seems to be a trend of putting customers on the spot to tip or donate) I find that irritating. 
That was not the reason for my review of 2 stars. In reality I would give this place 2.5 stars. The food or at least what I ordered was well below average. I'll start with the sides. I know collard greens are probably not the most popular amongst folks but, I actually enjoy em and can tell good quality of greens. These were bland and seems undercooked. What made it worst is there is no hot sauce available for them. The cowbro beans were also bland. If you're lucky enough to have a few pieces of sausage in them it makes up for the blandness. The brisket was my main reason for the rating I give. It was dry and has no flavor on its own, I think that's why you must drown it with the house bar b q sauce. The bun it came with was cold and quick to become soggy or crumble. Overall this would not be a place to bring family or a friend that's craving BBQ"}
{"text":"OMGosh!!! Just had my fix of my favorite BBQ! Could just about drink that Tennessee/Carolina sauce. Lived next to this place back in '93 and realized again that I need to get there way more often!
Mark even recognized me and hooked me up with some of the best Mac & Chez ever...as I was already getting the slaw and bro beans! Their sides are almost worth a trip there themselves. Next time a slice of that sweet potato pie is coming with me too 
Thanks for all the years Mark...and to many more!!"}
{"text":"A good amount of meat on the pulled pork.  Crappy bun.  Sauce is good.  A few pieces of pork tasted like paper had gotten into meat.  The mac and cheese was crap, and so not worth 2.50.  My roommate loves BBQ so the idea of rubbing this one in when I came home backfired.  

The take home message here is OVERPRICED!!!!"}
{"text":"Finally! An amazing place to get fantastic BBQ sandwiches in Phoenix! I went here for the first time a few weeks back (totally blanked out on the Yelp reviewing).  Some co-workers suggested we go there, saying it was one of the best places in The Valley for pork BBQ. They were right!

It's a tiny restaurant, and chances are you've driven by it a couple times but just have never noticed it. It's nothing fancy inside, just great service, great food and happy customers. I had one of the massive pork BBQ sandwiches on the menu and had flashbacks of the days when I lived in the Carolinas. MmmMmm deee-licious!

I could go on all day writing about how good Honey Bear's is, but I'll just let you go try it for yourself. Go on! Go!"}
{"text":"Wow, I had eaten here before and it was good. But today was another story. Ordered the Pork BBQ sandwich and beans. Waiting for my food, I noticed there were multiple flies in the restaraunt which is not a good sign... Then I got my food. Now, I like a good BBQ sandwich and was looking forward to this!  BUT, the bun was wet on the bottom, and when I picked it up, the meat fell through. It was not wet with bbq sauce either. It was more like water, which was slightly disgusting. I tried to eat the meat with a fork- there was almost no BBQ sauce and NO flavor.   I threw it in the trash and left. I was very dissatisfied."}
{"text":"Big  Thank you to Honey Bears to start off, why you ask ? Because they were open ! Wish I could give a 1/2 star extra for that.  Listen Downtown!  you   want me  to bring my family and friends down on the weekend,you want us to explore downtown and use the metro rail,   we need some family friendly , hopefully locally owned,  places to eat !  So 1 big ole star for that!  Now for the rest ...Honey Bears has that  hole in the wall , down south feel to me , and that alone will probably bring me back at sometime .  Especially if I have kids with me otherwise it's Switch, Matt's or Fez. 

Okay and now for the hits:

This is a  good  place for pulled pork or BBQ chicken sandwich ...don't stray from that and you will be happy , husband and kiddos gave a big two thumbs up for that... lil mini me had a 1/2 chicken dinner  w/o 
BBQ sauce ( weirdo)  and pronounced it good.  Mine were  ribs which were very small, not meaty and I had trouble with tang of the vinegar based sauce.(BTW hubby loved it ) Portions were big on everything but my ribs.  Faux Daughter number 2 couldn't finish her sandwich. 

I could eat a big ole plate of the mac and cheese wow cheesey goodness... kids agreed.
Fries were rumored to be good , one of my kids said  better than
 in -n-out the others shot her a dirty look .. so you try them and see. 
Loved the coleslaw and I wouldn't  share it with anyone .Corn was good but not memorable. 

They have RC and Seven up products which goes to show it's old school I guess. If you can't abide by that bring your own I guess. 

Service was great, the dude taking our order was personable, helpful and patient with our big order. They also redid mini me's order when it first came with BBQ sauce. 

Place is nicer than Stacey's for ambiance but I don't really look for that with BBQ , do you?"}
{"text":"There are an awful lot of BBQ joints around town with the recent increase in BBQ's popularity. Then there are some that have been around a bit longer, like Honey Bear's BBQ! The original location on Van Buren opened in 1986 and fortunately, it's right around the corner from my office.

Even though I'm on this side of town nearly every day, I was still happy to drive over toward 52nd Street to meet up with my girlfriend's brother for lunch. This place has plenty of seats despite how small it appears to be. And the \"standing dining\" lobby is a unique touch for those who are in a hurry to get back to work.

Now why would you wanna do that? Food this good needs to be savored and appreciated... Over a long lunch hour. But then again, my office is less than five minutes away.

I've dined at Honey Bears several times previously. I've even entertained clients here. Yeah it's a little on the \"divey\" side of things. But the food will make you forget about that.

Our lunch today was excellent as usual. The three slider combination is my go to entree. Unless it's Friday and they have catfish on hand. The pulled-pork, chicken and brisket are all tasty. And because this is Tennessee style, go grab some extra sauce. The sauce is so good, you'll be tempted to drink it.

Today's lunch was fun and we all enjoyed the food. Especially the \"Cowbro Beans\"! The only reason I deducted one star is because we were all looking forward to Peach Cobbler for dessert. They had none. And they were out of RC Cola. (Yeah, I like RC!) Oh, and no cornbread?! No worries, I'll swing by again for lunch soon!"}
{"text":"The chicken barbeque sandwich is tasty. Their side dishes and lemonade is good and the service is fast. The place is on the plain side but they serve you clean tables and away you go. Will come back."}
{"text":"I am disappointed in the service. I organize a monthly lunch at work. This month we chose Honey Bears. I contacted them through the email on the website. The person who responded was good at answering questions. She informed me that they need payment in advance for advance orders. We usually pay cash and I've never had any other restaurants require this. I agreed to give a credit card over the phone but the phone number she gave went straight to voicemail every time I tried to call. To make a long story short, I was never able to place the order ahead of time. SO I called the store directly and they put the order together quickly and without advance payment. The man at the store even brought the food out and loaded it in our car. The food was good. I will never use them again for a bulk order though. Too much headache! I shouldn't have to work so hard to give them business."}
{"text":"We've been to HB BBQ a couple times thanks to Groupon, and I'm a big fan of the ribs.  The meat literally falls off the bone, and the sauce is excellent.  The second time we went we had the chicken and rib plate, which is how we'll probably do it from now on.  

I'm not a fan of the sides, otherwise this place would have had 5 stars.  There's not a lot of seating, so going during major meal times can present a problem if you're planning to dine in.  Also, It doesn't look like they can seat large parties together...most of the tables only seat 4 people.

Overall, the meats are excellent.  It is definitely a place I have and would continue to go back to.  I'd go more often, but they're not that close to where I live."}
{"text":"Okay so I came here after I did meps in downtown Phoenix. This place is BOMB! It's like a little mom and pop, hole in the wall shop. I love barbecue sandwiches. So that's exactly what I got but with coleslaw and a pickle came with it too. It looks southern on the inside and looks very quaint on the outside. But I'm glad I saw it because I almost went to a sandwich place that was next to it until my mom told me there was a BBQ place. I was very pleased. It smelled lovely when we were there. I can't wait to go back and again and eat there. I will definitely be coming back. So if you like BBQ, try this place!"}
{"text":"Holy shit. Best BBQ in the valley. You don't need no teeth to eat our meat is their line. Good southern BBQ with all the fixins. The greens are dynamite and the sweet potato pie is worth fighting a shark for."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try Honey Bear's for a while, was planning to go visit Town Talk ll. But since I start work at 5:00am, and take lunch around 10:00 - 10:30. Town Talk doesn't open until 11:00, and Honey Bear's opens at 10:00! Honey Bear's sits right next to another of my favorites(Best of Philly). 
When you walk in, there's a counter right in front of you. Menu is a little confusing, but just tell them what you want. Even though it was lunch, I had a half slab of pork ribs with potato salad. Their ribs are probably my second or third favorite ribs I have eaten. Ribs have a lot of meat, very good smoke taste, not the tenderest ribs I have had but nothing wrong with it. Potato salad was very good also, little different from what I am use to. 
Price wise is about what is expected for ribs. Half slab of ribs(meaty), potato salad, order of fries, plus a drink. for about $20.00
Very happy with my meal, will diffidently come back."}
{"text":"I don't know what I just ate... but it sure as hell wasn't Tennessee BBQ.

Let me start this off by saying: I moved to Phoenix from North Carolina, and I was born in Louisiana - so my bar for BBQ, Southern, and soul food is admittedly very high.

So far 9/10 attempts to find good Southern food here have failed... and this was one of those failures.

It's not my aim to be mean, and I know this is a family business - but dammit, I get offended when I eat stuff like this parading under the guise of Southern food. I think it's misleading to people who've never had the chance to taste the real stuff.

I'd say: don't eat here... but it's a local family business and I'm not a jerk. Honestly - they just need to hire a pit master from Tennessee or North Carolina who knows wtf is up and let them do their thing. It's never too late to reassess and improve.

To be more specific:
Cons 
Brisket on my sandwich was a wet slop, almost like a pot roast and flavor was off. Sauce was weird and didn't blend well with the meat.
Potato salad was in a word - bizarre! Not sure what I was tasting in there - but there was too much of it and it overpowered everything.
Greens were bland as hell, and a little rubbery. Also... put out some hot sauce! What kind of BBQ joint doesn't have at least 2-3 different types of hot sauce! And salt!
The woman working the counter... wow. Really odd demeanor, like she's half asleep. Not very friendly and I watched her clean the same table for 15 minutes. Didn't bring our food out... just nodded at the counter and said \"yours is over there\". When we asked for hot sauce, she just seemed confused... which in turn was confusing... because... BBQ?!


Pros
Mac n cheese was good! 
They have RC cola and Big Red on tap! Classic. 
Cute place 
Friendly owner"}
{"text":"Great BBQ.  The coleslaw was fantastic, and the pulled pork was quite tasty.  The sauce was also super good.   I would have gave 5 starts, but I did deduct one as the people who talk about the nasty bathroom here are totally right.  Bring your Purell if you wanna use the bathroom first."}
{"text":"Stopped by to pick up some BBQ beef to take home and make sandwiches for the family. Unlike some BBQ places in the valley, the meat was very lean, well cooked with a slightly smokey, well seasoned taste. We did not get any sides nor drinks so I cannot evaluate those. 
The cost per pound for the beef was a couple of dollars less than Dave's BBQ, Tom's BBQ or Andrew's BBQ. There were four customers ahead of me in line, but it only took 5 minutes for the food to be ready after I placed my order."}
{"text":"\"The 1st warning sign should have been the lack of bbq smell when entering in the parking lot. Someone in the group mentioned that they must smoke the ribs at a different location. The servings are huge, but the food was disappointing. I'm used to great flavor without the bbq sauce and meat that falls off the bone. Here, if you didn't have sauce, you did't have flavor. I think they boil their ribs then grill them. The corn on the cobb was waaayy over cooked and water spewed down my arm after every bite. I've had better!\""}
{"text":"Looking for good BBQ? 
Got a hankering for some tasty meats, slow roasted to perfection?
Hop a flight to Austin Texas and head straight for 'The County Line' BBQ. 

If you can't do that, the next best thing in Phoenix is Honey Bears. A long time establishment dedicated to satiating the appetites of carnivores everywhere. 
Their motto is quaint and to the point;  \"You don't need no teeths to eat our meat.\"
Isn't that just precious?
And so it goes, their motto has managed to attract the dentifrice-challenged from all over the valley, their smiles resembling jack-'o-lanterns.

Well I have all my 'teeths', which is precisely why I come here. 
Being older, looks beginning to wane, I still have a nice set of choppers which excludes me from the dentifrice challenged category. It also makes me revered by other diners my age as a demi-god of sorts. 
 
So whenever i'm feeling down, a little blue over how I never get the once-over from hot babes anymore, I come here,  where I'm worshipped by  toothless fucks from all over Phoenix, and all for little more than a lifetime of dental care! Go figure.

Their brisket. pork shoulder and chicken, all tasty, better than most BBQ joints in Phoenix. 
Beans and coleslaw, nothing spectacular. 
Service, friendly.
Truly a good BBQ joint. Sauce is decent.

It's like eating at a homeless shelter, except the bbq is really good, and some half-assed preacher isn't in the dining area requiring you say a bunch of prayers in order to get a free meal."}
{"text":"Honey Bear. 
What a great name. I wish I would have named my first son Honey Bear, or Cornbread J-Cool...something sick like that. 
I think that's where going into labor fucks most women up. 
They're all like...\"Oh yeah baby, I'm down with Luciano or Vincenzo if its a boy... sooo very Italian.\" 
That's in the nine months preceding birth. 

Have a little chat with her after she delivers...it's a whole new ball game.
Now it's all, \"My son isn't going to have a name that sounds like some greaseball mobster, WTF is the matter with you anyway?\"

Wow.
I don't know how I went down that road. I WAS going to tell you about Honey Bear's but I guess I'm still pissed my first born was named Dan. 

Anyway, the food here is pretty tasty. I like it because you can order meat by the pound which is all I ever do. I order eight ounces of barbecued beef, no bun and a glass of water..it's around eight bucks.
The service is super fast too, consuming about fifteen minutes of your lunch hour if you wolf your shit like I do. 
Their sauce is flavorful too, you'll want to slather a boatload on your beef...kind of sweet and slightly spicy...good tang. 

And speaking of good tang, what better way to finish off the remainder of your lunch hour than by going to Band Aid's show lounge...just a block away on 7th and Virginia?

A lunch hour chocked with tang.
The fantasy of what heights your son may have aspired to had you gotten your way...naming him Cornbread.
And crop-dusting that empty cubicle with some major beef and beer farts around mid afternoon...sending that evil co-worker of yours into a catatonic funk upon her return from the ladies room.

Now that's what I'm talking about."}
{"text":"I went Honey Bear's with my wife to use a Groupon.  We like to try different places, not get stuck on one place and we were disappointed with Honey Bear's.

We got the pulled pork and BBQ chicken. The pork was dry with no smokey flavor. The chicken was drenched in sauce hiding the flavor. The sauce was too sweet for me as well, overpowering everything it's put on.

The sides of beans and corn were nothing  special as well. At the end. We were glad we tried them because it made us feel better about our favorite BBQ, Waldos in Mesa. 

We'll keep trying, but we believe no one will ever compare."}
{"text":"Really good traditional BBQ. Very casual restaurant. Counter service and reasonable prices. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I had Chicken and Ribs with beans and mac & cheese and it was finger licken good. If you like saucey BBQ this place is pretty good. Both the Rib and Chicken were falling off the bone and the beans were really good. I'm not usually in to the BBQ that is saucey I found myself stuffing my face. By the way... the serving size was huge."}
{"text":"Good god damn is this some awesome chow.

Whenever we had some lame corporate event, there would almost always be Honey Bear's before in huge trays.  It was usually the only good thing that would happen.

They do everything good here.  By way way waaaay far the best BBQ in a 200 mile radius of Phoenix at least."}
{"text":"Based on other Yelp reviews I almost decided to NOT use my Group On coupon, BUT gave them a try anyway.  GLAD I did.  There were 4 of us and ALL of us had a wonderful meal, good service, nice atmosphere.  The ribs were plentiful, large, juicy and even though the regular sauce was weak, they had a 'hotter' sauce that was some of the best I've ever had.  Sides were plentiful and good (mac/cheese, sweet potato fries, sweet potato tots).  The chicken was as good as the ribs.  Will be back again as prices are fair, food GREAT, and all the rest just a bonus.  BUT don't go here to watch a game on TV as the TV's had the worst reception of ANY restaurant I've ever been it--worse than a 1950's signal---however, I came to EAT and then went home to watch TV."}
{"text":"Went in today with my friend. I must say for a joint which specializes in bbqs, the food was below standards. 
I took the half pork ribs. Not only the sauce was bad but the meat was hard and not tasty at all. My friend who took the chicken sandwich with hotlinks was equally disappointed with the food.
I'm done with this place and not visiting this again."}
{"text":"I have to say this is one of the best fast food BBQ places I've had in Phoenix! It's very quaint centrally located in downtown with an excellent view of skyscrapers and office buildings. The pulled pork is my favorite, the sauce is a great addition to this tender pork sandwich. And the baked beans are awesome! The ambiance is relaxed and casual but very friendly service is the thing that keeps you going back."}
{"text":"We drove to the LoLo's downtown location from basically the 51 and Shea to find that it closed at 7. From there, we drove up Grand to Town Talk II, which sadly, also closed at 7. We had a chat with the owner who told us that the closest place for barbecue was Honey Bear's, even though he said that he didn't want to see us leave.
It was about a 5 minute drive from there. Once we arrived, we ordered. I got the ribs and two nasty side items that came with it. The fountain drink machine didn't have Coke or Pepsi products, but had R-C Cola products. The selection was interesting, but I found it unique and somewhat cool.
Anyway, my plate had six or seven ribs drenched in a too-sweet barbecue sauce. The ribs had almost no meat on them.
I don't know, maybe I asked for the wrong food or something, but I was highly disappointed in Honey Bear's. I do admit, however, that the televisions showing the NBA Finals did help a bit. I don't think I'll come back. I've also learned a valuable lesson: for the most part, restaurants in Downtown Phoenix close at 7."}
{"text":"Pretty good lunch, not the best but not the worst. The service by it's employees though is outstanding.

Ordered the #4 (sandwich, 2 ribs, side w/ drink) cost over $11... $4 more for two extra runs that tasted great but had almost no meat on them. Should've just stuck with the basic combo without ribs.

Line moved very quickly and before I could even pour my drink my food was up. The beef was good enough that it'd make a good snake/lunch throughout the week so I got a pound to go, still filling a little hungry for dessert I had enough cash for a piece of pie but they gave it to me for free before I could even put my hand in my pocket.

Food: 3, Price: 2, Service: 5 but this restaurant is more of a \"fast food\" style/design so I'll rate it by the taste/price... 3. I'll revisit them for sure, maybe the rib scenario was a fluke."}
{"text":"This is just very bad bbq and poor service.   I have given it several chances and nothing has changed.   Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Ive been to this location a few times, and its only decent. The food is pretty good (I always get the brisket sandwich), but the place is always dirty, and its HOT in there. I mean, like, INVEST IN SOME A/C, PEOPLE!!!! For that reason alone I only give it 2 stars. Were it nice and cool and clean in there, I would give it 4 stars, but having to eat at dirty tables in sweltering heat makes for a bad experience."}
{"text":"Like most people said, USE TO BE, good place. The bathroom is a mess! I got the brisket, couldn't really taste the smoke or BBQ of it, really plain.  The sauce in my opinion has gotten sweeter, use to have a kick but not no more. No salt packets! Every other packet besides salt! Lady behind the counter had to put some in a sauce cup. Use to live this place, but have second guess coming here now with so many more options. Hopefully the look at some reviews and step their game up."}
{"text":"HB's is really good BBQ, sauce is a little spicy and delicious. The only rub is the staff. 9/10 times, they suck. Slow, rude and often gets orders wrong or not fresh.
So, just to surmise, 4.5 on food when prepared correctly, 3/5 is probably what you are gonna get."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on a whim with my little girl. You never know if small places like this will have items for kids, and they did have one kid meal, which was 2 chicken strips and fries. I was starving, and not sure what to get so I went with a value meal - sandwich, two ribs and a side. It was pretty good, but I've had way better. The pulled pork sandwich was overcooked and dry, so it's a good thing they have yummy BBQ sauce to poor over it. For my side dish, I had sweet potato tater tots. They were OK, but looked like they came out of a frozen bag of Ore-Ida. 

The staff was really friendly, and it seemed like they had a lot of regulars in there. 

I thought it was really over-priced. Our bill was $21.75. And the food just wasn't good enough for me to want to go back."}
{"text":"This place was a joke. The restrooms were disgusting to say the least. The cashier couldn't answer any questions about how the food was prepared. The Mac and cheese and the sauce were equally watery and everything was lacking flavor. The sauce tasted like tomato soup and the \"ribs\" tasted like something you'd get in a school cafeteria. And on top of that, I'm pretty sure the coleslaw was spoiled and made me sick. I should have asked for a refund the moment I saw the food in the tray but I decided to give them a chance. Complete waste of 30 dollars."}
{"text":"High Fructose Corn Syrup as the main ingredient in the sauce is my main issue. Why not use real sugar? First time customer and the Spanish speaking employees are difficult to understand and They would say yes to every question that I had about the menu. I guess the customer is always right! The Pound of Brisket was good. The pulled pork cup was good and greasy. The manager is cool and friendly."}
{"text":"Worse place ever people were rude and and looks really NASTY the food taste like the place looms on the inside"}
{"text":"Darn good BBQ. Darn good price.  Good local joint to check out if you're in the neighborhood.  Pulled pork is to die for!"}
{"text":"I work directly across the street and been wanting to visit for a while and finally did.  I ordered for lunch the pulled pork BBQ sandwich with 2 sides, cole slaw and corn on the cob.  It was totally yummy!  The pork was juicy and tender.  The side of BBQ sauce for dipping was tangy and zippy, awesome! I could pour that stuff on everything. The cole slaw was sweet and creamy, not dry and bland like at other places.  The corn on the cob was pipping hot, sweet and tasty.  Honey Bear's I will definitely return for lunch soon!"}
{"text":"I can't get over what a jerk the counter guy was. There were three of us. He got our order wrong, but I didn't want to get into it with the guy after having witnessed the fight the guy in front of me had with him. To say it was a fight is a misnomer. The guy just didn't care. He looked at the ticket. Shrugged his shoulders and pointed to a cup on the wall. The customer was disputing the order, not the cup on the wall. The customer looked at me as if to say \"Is this really going on\". I am not sure if the cashier is special needs or just resigned to sitting on that stool day after day knowing it will never get better. I didn't want to get too close to him lest a part of my soul was sucked into his whirlpool of misery.  There was no ice for the iced tea or soda. The soda came out of the machine flat, stick with the lemonade, at least it was this side of lukewarm. The chicken was disgusting. It was dry, the outside was hard. The ribs (I ordered a half and got a full), were delicious as was the pulled pork. The links were good but hotter than they should be. Stay way from the bro'beans. Potato Salad is good mustard. Cole Slaw was good as was the Mac'n'Cheese. As good as the food is, it doesn't make up for the cashier. The cook came out from the back and was a delight. She was very sweet when she apologized for the chicken and gave me a second one but the meal was already over. I hadn't complained to anyone except my dining companions so I don't know if they served me the bad chicken knowing it wasn't good or if they have listening devices so they can laugh at the misery of their guests. Save yourselves, either abandon all hope before entering here or better yet, don't go."}
{"text":"ALERT ALERT!!!!!
PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT
They will be shut down. Food made me throw up violently. Then I was denied a refund bc I couldn't find my receipt amongst the throw up. 
Customer service is always creepy. I would warn african people and ppl of african decent not to eat here. Even though the business is black American owned. They do not cater to their own folks. Just expect the worse treatment, dirty food, & slave mentality.
A great alternative would be The new rest Cherry Tree house BBQ nearby. Way better food.
THIS IS A PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT- AVOID- REGISTERED NURSE"}
{"text":"It may look like a fast food joint on the outside but this place is local Arizona BBQ at it's tastiest. 

I ordered the 1/2 lb. pork rib dinner ($11.49) which came with two sides. They ran out of collard greens so I settled for two corn cobs.

With the ribs and corn my face and fingers are super messy from the sauce. Good thing I'm eating alone. The ribs were super delicious! I wanted to cover every bite in their BBQ sauce. It was that good. The sauce was slightly tangy with just the right amount of sweetness. Honey Bear's calls it Tennessee BBQ, but here in Phoenix it's oh so good."}
{"text":"$10 for a medium drink, chicken sandwich, and a small salad = MEH! Overpriced and nothing special of this BBQ chicken sandwich.

I'll go back for a second try, someday..."}
{"text":"Delicious BBQ! We got a coupon for half off on Groupon, which was the first bonus. When we arrived, the woman at the cashier was super sweet and helpful. She suggested her favorites and was patient with us while we decided. After we sat down to eat, the owner came and asked how our food was. THEN he came back with more sliders for us to try, for free! Such great service, delicious food! Next time I'm in Tempe, I'll definitely go back! Great job, Honey Bears!!"}
{"text":"While at the recent Chandler Beer and BBQ festival, I decided to give Honey Bears a try.  I had never been there before and have heard them mentioned as one of the great BBQ joints in the Phoenix area. 

What a disappointment. The ribs we ordered were tough and gristly and tasted like they had been \"quick-cooked\". I've made and eaten enough ribs to know when a piece of meat has been rushed. My guess is they were scrambling to meet the high demand of the event and took some shortcuts. (It was later in the day) If thats the case I would say its a shame to sacrifice quality to make a buck. 

With all the new BBQ places popping up in the Phoenix area, there's no room for the ones that compromise. Just my luck with 20+ BBQ booths to choose from at the festival I picked the one that obviously does."}
{"text":"Honey Bear's is no Joe's BBQ in Gilbert but I actually enjoy it. I usually get the pork sandwich and potato salad and I find myself going here. I like the BBQ sauce and the quality of the meat is good. If I'm in Tempe and want BBQ I usually go here."}
{"text":"Some of the best BBQ around, be sure to sauce it up good and try the chicken and ribs! YUM!"}
{"text":"I would have never thought I could find BBQ like this in PHX, AZ. I find myself at this place everytime I'm in the Phoenix area! I love there BBQ sauce and the meat is great! If you see this place stop and try it out!"}
{"text":"Love Honey Bear BBQ! A buddy had them cater a party for him and I nearly passed out from eating to much. The pulled pork, chicken, or beef are all great and they don't skimp on the sauce which is what it's all about. It's all about the sauce! The peach cobbler is good too. I go there every chance I can not to mention I can reminisce about the old days as a kid eating in the retro-blue IHOP building."}
{"text":"There are some mighty fine BBQ joints in the Phoenix area - This ain't one of them.

The good: The people were friendly and helpful. The restaurant is laid out nicely and clean. The selection of side dishes is good. Tasty rolls. They carry Big Red soda.

The So-So: The ribs, what a shame. The texture and taste seem to indicate they were steamed or boiled. They are fall of the bone soft, but lack anything resembling flavor. My spare ribs had a ton of cartilage.

The BBQ sauce was not bad, not inspired, but certainly better than the ribs they were on. The potato salad did more of a service to the BBQ sauce than the ribs.

The Bad: The price! $19 for a rack of less than mediocre ribs!

I'm not likely to voluntarily return here soon."}
{"text":"Before hitting a Suns game I went to Honey Bear's last week with my brother-in-law, who grew up in Phoenix.  He says the place is an institution.  I liked it, but I liked the sides better than the BBQ itself.  

I ordered the sandwich plus two ribs, a drink and a side for $14.49.  My sandwich was the pulled pork which was good but a bit dry.  A little extra BBQ sauce came in handy, although the sauce was - per my own personal preferences - a little too sweet, in need of some heat and a bit too orange in color.  The ribs were killer.  My side was cole slaw, which surprised my brother-in-law.  With all the great other choices, why would you order cole slaw, he wondered?  Because I love it , and the Honey Bear's slaw was great.  Fresh and delish.  I also \"borrowed\" his mac & cheese and his Cowbro Beans.  He thought the mac & cheese was rich - I slurped it up and practically licked the cup clean.  Fantastic.  Beans were ok but too meat-filled for my taste.  Was bummed they were out of corn on the cob but I loved the sides we had.

Special thanks to the brother-in-law for the introduction.  I love cool local places like Honey Bear's BBQ!  I'd go back."}
{"text":"I believe this place is going on nearly 40 years. I met the owner. Most of the good places where I'm from (SC) are run my old black guys. This guy has the same roots.

Based on my two experiences Honey Bears gets one thing right... pulled pork BBQ... good thing that's all that matters to me. Could be considered best BBQ sandwich is greater PHX area. Grab one to or fro the airport. There is NOTHING else from this location for a couple miles.

*Save your money and avoid the sides. Hell, if you need more food, just get two sammies. Done."}
{"text":"O have had strange experiences here. The service was not good, but the food was. Not sure what to make of this place!"}
{"text":"Great for lunch or catering.  The sauce is tangy and not too sweet or thick.  The peach cobbler is much too sweet, but I love the pulled pork or chicken.  It's a little smokey (a little dry, but that's what the sauce is for).  It's no frills but delicious.  Plus it's inexpensive for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"No.. just no.   I had been to the location about 5 years ago.. I forgot why it had been so long. I don't believe the food was bad 5 years ago. 
Well.. to start the Mac and cheese was so off base. It tasted almost like instant ( although I know it wasn't ) it had that generic made for the long day taste and generic feel to it. Certainly not a home style mix.   The ribs were under seasoned. cold. And seemed to be little meat on them. The collard greens lacked flavor and they were cold. And the bun was just sad. I was dumb founded about the sauce as it was very watered down and no kick to it.  On top of which the establishment gets a c in cleanliness! I don't know what happened...."}
{"text":"He's got high hopes, he's got high hopes --- as for me Nope!

I really wanted this place to be good....but I was a tad bit disappointed!  I ordered some sliders - one of each kind Chicken, Beef, and Pork.  Overall was okay, but what really got me on the sad side was my bun was soggy at the bottom.  Ever try to eat soggy bread?  Not good at all.  We also had some Ribs.  I thought it was again okay since I do like it on the crispy side, but it also had a burnt taste.  Is anything ever good burnt?  Nope!  

The workers there were great and I think they do a good job.  The place itself is like a shed with some decors.  They do have TVs for the game, but I'm not sure I want to venture here to watch it. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Stopped here after a Group-On promo. The person at the register, like many of the reviews below, was not the friendliest in the world but then I came here for BBQ and not to make a new friend. 

Ordered the 1/2 rack of ribs, hot link on the side and cole slaw and potato salad. The ribs truthfully were very good, some of the best I have had in a long time. The BBQ sauce was also excellent but more of a mid-west style and tasty. 

I cannot say how the hot link was because they shorted me on this! Sorry but ordering something then paying for it and finding it missing once you get home just is not right. Really gave me a bad taste in my mouth over the place... 

I have one more Group-On voucher and am using it this week. This time eating inside so lets see if they short me on anything else this time...

~~~~~~~~
UPDATE! Returned to Honey Bears on Friday and first off the person working the register was a lot nicer to work with. Also mentioned that I had been shorted a hot link and she took care of it, giving me an extra one today. 

Had the ribs again and once again they were excellent. Also got a BBQ Beef sandwich to go for lunch the next day and it was very good as well. 

Course when I was at the restaurant this time the soda fountain stopped working and as usual it was AFTER several of us had paid for drinks. Oh well..."}
{"text":"I found this place to be far inferior to both other BBQ joints and other restaurants in general. My family and I decided to meet up with my parents here before taking my daughter to see Zoo lights at the Phoenix Zoo. It was a poor choice.

To start the staff was unfriendly. The gentleman taking the order had a question for my step mother and instead of politely asking my father (who was ordering) he just yelled over his head to her in an offstandish tone. When my wife and I went to order he just walked off. A woman with a blank look cane out and just started at us until we ordered. Really bad first impressions. 

The food didn't help improve their standings. I ordered the brisket sandwich with fries and coke slaw, my wife ordered the pulled pork sandwich with fries and corn. She was told it would be a bit for the corn to be ready. 

I can't speak about the issues with my parents order (they just said it was unpleasant) ours was ccoolldd, bland and soggy. The buns weren't toasted so the liquid from the meat turned them to tasteless mush. My coleslaw was unimpressive and the fries were way too salty. The \"freshly made\" corn was cold and overcooked. While the fries were oversalted, the corn had none. None of the tables had any shalt shakers, not were there any packets available. When I asked for some I got this is look and then the woman behind the counter have me a plate of salt. Odd. No amount of plate salt could save the bland BBQ. While there was a solid smokey flavor, that was it. The meat wasn't seasoned and sightly acrid. 

Blech, waste of $30. Never coming back."}
{"text":"This is a good place to go if you want good (but not great) barbecue.  They had speedy service, which explains the very busy lunch crowd."}
{"text":"I mistakenly posted this review at the wrong location at first. This review applies to the Tempe location. Our second visit was not a good one. The first time, I'd give the food 3.5-4 out of 5 stars because our pulled pork sandwiches were flavorful and generous. (My husband had the same thing today and enjoyed it.) This time, dining on a Groupon, I went for the half rack of ribs \"dinner.\" It came with a roll that wasn't heated enough to even start to melt the butter (which we had to ask for at the counter) plus two sides of my choice. The onion rings were very good. The problem was with the ribs.

The \"half rack\" consisted of 6-8 long rib bones with a tiny bit of overdone, chewy meat on them. The restaurant's own BBQ sauce was poured over them. I tried to eat them, but they were so tough I couldn't get more than a few bites. The flavor was truly awful - like ribs that had been cooked days ago and reheated. I took my plate back to the counter and asked for something else. The four people behind the counter (which seemed like a lot, since there were only two customers at 5 p.m.) were gracious about swapping out my entree and even offered to refund some money. I didn't take the money, just asked for a pulled pork sandwich. They presented me with one to eat there plus a very generous take-out portion with two buns and lots of sauce. 

Although ultimately I was satisfied that we got our money's worth, especially taking into account the Groupon, I wouldn't go back based on the quality of those ribs. I can't say enough, though, about the kindness of the staff. They were great - not just making sure we were happy but also apologizing several times."}
{"text":"This was a pretty decent place for good BBQ.  There isn't that much variety - mostly focused on BBQ meat sandwiches.  The good thing is that despite the small menu, what they do have is pretty good - I had the BBQ beef, which was tasty and had a ton of flavor."}
{"text":"love this place!!! the wait is long and the cashier is slow!!! there is one worker which i think is the owners son he has long hair he is awesome! he helped us get our food faster! but the other cashier was so slow!!! but besides the wait it is an amazing place the pork BBQ sandwich was Delicious and so was the coleslaw."}
{"text":"Had the combo Meal #3 Sandwich & 2 Ribs, with the Beef Brisket sandwich, Cowbro' Beans & Mac and Cheese. Everything was terrific, the Mac & Cheese was just OK. The brisket & ribs were delicious, and the Cowbro' Beans were tasty too."}
{"text":"The sauce is good and they're always offering Groupons. I've tried their other food and its terrible. The fried chicken and catfish had absolutely no flavor. The bread is cold and soggy. The peach cobbler and mac and cheese were obviously microwaved (too hot in some spots, icy cold in others) and lacked flavor. If you're going for a pulled pork bbq sandwich with fries, you'll be fine. Anything else and you'll be really disappointed. 

Overall totally overrated."}
{"text":"Overall they had some good options. I had the BBQ beef with sweet potato fries. It was ok, nothing to write home about but maybe a yelp review. The ribs looked good too. The prices did seem a litttle high for what you got. Oh! They did not have sweet tea. The only BBQ joint I've been to without sweet tea."}
{"text":"have not been there in a long time...the guy taking the order was in some other world.
the amount of pork or chicken on the sandwich has been reduced to almost half.
the drinks are watered down. and the prices are up. Me thinks I wont be back there."}
{"text":"It has been about two years since I last came to Honey Bear's. The last few time I had visited, I felt like the portions were a little skimpy for the price I was paying. However that all changed when I brought my dad for a late lunch/early dinner. 

We order the full slab with potatoe salad and beans. Man when we got home, the plate was packed with ribs. So much so that the two of us sharing was not a problem. I am not a fan of potatoe salad, however I will admit that theres was quite tasty! The bbw sauce was better than I remember and although my dad enjoyed the sauce, he makes his own and just had to say there's is good but mine is still better. SMH!. 

They have revamped the menu to make it a little more affordable and they seemed to have up there portions a tad. Way too go. My dad enjoyed one Phoenix's hometown spots. Good job! I will be back again soon for rib tip Friday's!"}
{"text":"New ownership maybe but it's not the same here. Cashier wasn't friendly. The high chairs were so messy with caked in food. It took me many wipes to get it suitable for my son to sit in and eat in. Wires hanging down from window lights.  Napkin dispensers empty during dinner time. Come on!"}
{"text":"CLASSIC BBQ JOINT !!!!!!

What a great place to get REAL BBQ !! The family owned and run aspect always appeals to me, and the casualness is pure downhome. This place reminds me of the authentic bbq joints in MPLS and St Paul MN, my hometown.
The pulled pork sand was as good as any as I have ever had, and the sides were unique. Just eating something called \"CowBro Beans\" is an experience. 
It maybe could be a little cleaner, but so could Famous Dave's.
Worth the time and money. Don't miss out."}
{"text":"We got the groupon which equalled a 50% discount. Good deal right? Sure, but when it came time to choose sides, they had some bullshit rules so you can only get 3 different sides even though they're giving you 6 total large and small containers. Why? Stupid policy, especially for an introductory offer. 

The staff is rude, uppity, and difficult to understand. The cashier seemed like a very unhappy person and made ordering a chore. I mean really, how hard is it to stay in mac n cheese. And if we cant choose sweet potato fries as a side, then don't call it a side. But what I really thought was classy was when we picked up our food after our number was blurted out. Three employees stood there and ignored us as we checked our order and made our way out of the \"restaurant.\"

The food would have to be ambrosia for us to make the trek here again. And it wasn't. The food was ok. I will never go back to this location. Period. May try the Tempe location but will stick with Lucille's. Sorry I strayed girl.

***Thank you Anna for the professional response. I appreciate that."}
{"text":"Loved the sauce, took extra, perhaps a bit more than I was supposed it.

The pulled pork was what was recommended by the man at the counter, and this made sense it is a BBQ place. The pork was quite good, but it was the vinegar based BBQ sauce that did it for me.

A nice, clean, respectable take-out restaurant on a main drag.

I'll never come back!!!  (Because I'll probably never be in Phoenix again!!!)"}
{"text":"This place use to be great. Not so much anymore. The lady that took our to go order was not pleasant. Probably won't return. They've changed the BBQ sauce. Who actually owns this place?"}
{"text":"This place has been around forever. The location on central for several years. I do like the sauce and often buy it alone by the quart.
I recently began working half a block away and stopped in for lunch.
I ordered a brisket sandwich with collard greens and BBQ beans as sides.
Strangely though they had just opened for the day, they had no greens so I went with slaw. My order was takeout, I think around $13. My bag was heavy. I was hungry and excited...that is until I opened my sandwich.
I expected some nice fresh brisket, juicy and hearty. What I had was a tiny hamburger roll with really dry chunks of slightly smoky meat. It was very unenjoyable. I realized of course that the weight was due to my two sides, which were good.
I won't be returning for lunch, for sauce maybe. I make a better brisket"}
{"text":"This is pretty good BBQ.  Not the best I have had but not the worst.  The sauce is yummy but the meat couldn't stand alone.  They seem to rely heavily on their sauce to carry the food.  

The Mac and Cheese was average...better than Kraft but I have had better out of a grocery store deli.  

I almost had to give them an extra star for their catchy slogan (\"You don't need no teeth to eat our meat\") but didn't because that would just be a silly thing for me to do."}
{"text":"Nah my fav food, fast food type of thing, I tried their breaded catfish , the was no flavor but tastes salty."}
{"text":"This is always been my favorite barbecue place in town, there pulled pork is really delicious.  There's always plenty of seating and nearby is the post office if you want to drop off your mail.  their side dishes always make me feel like I'm at home getting a homemade meal love their peach cobbler dessert. This place has a open container for sauce so you can get as much as extra bbq sauce as you like."}
{"text":"I've only been the their location on Central Ave.  When I went to order my usual I was informed that this location doesn't have french fries.  Ok bummer... I'll get along with it.

We went later in the evening and the place was really dead.  I'm sure at lunchtime its much busier."}
{"text":"I really like the sauce here. I think the it's darn good. It's nice 'n tart and sweeter than some, but that's how I like it. The meat is tender but not mushy. I can't claim that I'm a BBQ expert but I know what I like. The sides of beans, coleslaw, potato salad, & corn are good too.

BTW, this location is newer and has less \"character\" than the Phoenix ones, so that could be a good or bad thing, depending."}
{"text":"Zing Zing Zing!! Honey Bear's BBQ is my go to BBQ spot in downtown phoenix.  Meal of choice: is the pulled chicken sandwich, coleslaw, and tall RC Cola. 

I usually eat my sandwich open face with lots of sauce. Luckily, they always have a kettle of warm and zingy BBQ sauce available for the dine in guests. Beyond the BBQ being spot on the sides always seem to be just as delicious. Coleslaw, Mac n Cheese, Potato Salad, Sweet Potato Fries, etc............

My only qualm as of recently is it seems they have changed the coleslaw a bit. They made the portion larger which is awesome! But it's got some new things in it and I didn't enjoy it as much as usual. Bring back the old stuff!!"}
{"text":"Wanted a great BBQ place but this is not the one. I spent $10 on dry pork sandwich, chips, and a soda. The pork was very dry and very little sauce in it. I would not go back."}
{"text":"We arrived late afternoon on a Saturday and we should have known from the empty parking lot something was up. Where was everyone?  Other than the employees,  there were no other patrons. Food was expensive for each plate and not much for the price. My ribs were tough and the sauce seemed watered down. Overall,  the food was not so good. Tolerable but not satisfying at all. It was a little dark inside and in need of updating. Don't get me wrong. I didn't mind too much on how it looked. It was clean. I was there for good bbq. Or, so I thought. I have had bbq from fancy restaurants to bbq shacks that have had bullet proof windows. Believe it or not, the bullet proof shack had one of the best bbq around. I go anywhere for bbq. It's been years since I've been to that shack. Probably have to roll up in a tank now, just to be safe. Anyway, however bad the experience at Honey Bear's, I do have to say that the employees at Honey Bear's were friendly and courteous. Unfortunately,  we won't be back."}
{"text":"Over priced food, served without a plate, in a real dump. I'm a BBQ lover but I don't love Honey Bear's.  I had the same impression of the one located in central Phoenix too but wanted to try once more before deciding I didn't like their food. Decision made."}
{"text":"We just went to Honey Bears it was after 11 and the sign said open at 11. We went in and the cook told us they were behind to give them another 20 mins or so. Not come in would you like a drink while you wait but nothing. Were we suppose to wait in our car til they opened so we left  as we were pulling out I took this picture. Boy if this isn't true just ask their cook!"}
{"text":"I work nearby and went at lunch for some brisket.  I was told it would take 2 minutes for the brisket to be ready, so I paid and waited. Then I was told it would take another 5 minutes. I then was told it was going to take longer and was offered chicken or pork instead. I choose chicken. It took over 20 minutes before I got my food. The chicken cost less, but I was not reimbursed the difference.  The soggy wet chicken had a very strong metallic taste....aluminum. I threw half of it away.  Wasted my lunch there....won't go back."}
{"text":"Despite all the local hype, this place is average at best. Everyone I know who has eaten there RAVES about it, but I just can't get into it. Take it with a grain of salt because I'm not like a huge BBQ buff at all, but I seriously don't think it tastes much better than ribs from say, Chili's or some chain resteraunt. BBQ sauce is BBQ sauce to me. It tastes the same as Kraft BBQ sauce from the bottle."}
{"text":"Been coming here occasionally for years but today I ordered three barbeque beef sandwiches and I was very disappointed, first of all the original owners must have sold this restaurant to a spanish speaking owner or family because the lady who took my order and the cook in the back were speaking spanish to each other, the beef in the sandwiches did not have any flavor, it tasted bland before I added the watery barbeque sauce, my sandwiches were served on cheap buns, the kind you buy at the grocery store for $1.25, the meat was most likely boiled and not cooked over a flame grill or smoker, in past years I always expected and received high quality food, this is not the case any more, I will never return to this location, very disappointed."}
{"text":"Okay, honestly, Honey Bear's couldn't hang in Memphis, Birmingham, Houston, or Lockhart  ... and fortunately for them, they don't need to 'hang' because they are smoking their meats in the BBQ wasteland of Phoenix, AZ.  

Because I fancy myself a BBQ expert (note: I'm more of a brisket purist), its difficult to rate HB's based on the integrity of the THEIR OWN meat and not as a comparison to others Valley and Nation-wide. This is exactly 'why' I think many of their rating suffer because everyone has undoubtedly had better BBQ elsewhere, wherever you may hail from, and it takes a stringent push from one's own natural reflexes to resist matching HBs up to 'local awesome BBQ joint'.  BBQ connoisseurs are funny like that.

So, overall, HB's earns a 3-star based on the following:

Pork Ribs - I'm more of a beef rib expert, but these ribs were generous and plentiful in their combo plate.  I was surprised that there was very likely a whole half-rack on my plate.  They are very tasty even without the sauce, with a nice peppery rub that did not dry out the meat.

Smoked Chicken - Juicy but slightly greasy.  This is amongst the most difficult smoked meat to pull off due to the propensity for it to become a stringy, dehydrated mess.  I don't think I would order it again, but the flavor was pretty decent and I don't regret trying it.

Pulled Pork - I got a 1/2 lb of pulled pork as a side meat, along with a couple of extra buns to make as a half-sandwich (a glob of meat on a half bun, folded over like a taco).  This is the only time I typically use sauce to counterbalance the white bread, whether its pork, brisket, or sausage.  I was surprised by how dry the pork was, particularly because pork is fatty and juicy, but here at HB's it was extra lean.  I thought I would hate the pork bc of this fact, but the sauce saves it from being a choking bolus of pig and flour.  Now I understand why they typically put this on a full bun and drown it in sauce.  As the 'specialty' of this restaurant, its kind of a gaffe that the quality is poor, but as a consumer, I'd order it again in limited amounts, and only as a 'side'.  Why?  Because I can provide my own perfect ratio of bread:pork:sauce.  Otherwise, I don't think that HB's could build me a pulled pork sandwich I could be happy with.

Sauce - If you don't know any better you'd think it was tip-top.  Sure, its 'pretty good', but its most-definitely a one-note mixture.  Too sweet for their peppery rubs.  A spicier sauce would do the trick better, IMO.

Corn on the Cob - Serviceable, but soggy and strangely devoid of spices typical of southern cuisine.

Cowbro Beans - Awesome.  Smokey flavor, thick sauce, and chunks of their smoked sausage.  Great compliment to a BBQ dinner.

Soda Fountain - The city's best.  BBQ restaurant staples such as 1a) Dr Pepper 1b) Big Red.  Their 'cola' is RC and they have Hines Rootbeer, Sunkist, Country Time Lemonade, and 7-Up.  They did some solid research on the fluid necessities of BBQ palates.  They also have a fridge of beer.

Price -  All that, which I described above came out to $33 with a large tip because the guy behind the counter was very cool.  It fed two hungry people during the season finale of LOST, with plenty extra for leftovers.  Very pleased in this area.

Overall - Hey, its PHX, and here we are better adapted to 'fill-ins' for our favorite spots back home.  It happens in every culinary category, from philly cheesesteaks to fish n chips; gnocchi to Q.  Why should this place be any different?"}
{"text":"I was disappointed. I love good BBQ, and I'm sure Honey Bear's has some good dishes. I guess my experience was about what I received for the price, not taste, as the food was on par for BBQ.  Not bad, not great. I arrived for lunch 11:45am on a Thursday to find they were out of all their BBQ pork, and all sandwiches with the exception of their beef. What? Out of the most popular BBQ dishes?  On a Thursday?  Right before lunch? Whaaaa?  But, I was told their special today was ribs, one side, a biscuit, and a drink for $12-something. I figured $12 was a little steep, but since I don't have BBQ too often, I'd go ahead and splurge a little. Anyway, when they called my number I felt confused. \"Uh, scuse me, I ordered the special, not whatever this half-order was.\" Did they forget something?  Nope, no mistake, that was mine.  Wow, this is $12+ bucks? Really? I guess I thought I'd get a little more food for a \"special\". This lunch, as pictured, was $13.56 after tax. I feel ripped off. When did BBQ get so expensive?  Because it's good?  Y'know what else is good?  LOTS OF OTHER KINDS OF FOOD!  Anyway, I was disappointed, and probably won't go back.  There's a few other BBQ joints in the area, I'll hit one of them next time.  BTW, if you find yourself in my position, standing at the counter, baffled by the high prices and minimal selection, go ahead and walk next door, literally 30 feet, to the Philly Cheese steak restaurant.  More food, cheaper price. Just my opinion."}
{"text":"Gross

I think the meats are boiled and not smoked. 

Everything was loose and chewy and over cooked to a mush. 

Don't eat here. It's living off hype."}
{"text":"Good bbq and fast friendly service! This place had been around for ages and is easy to see why. Keep it up!!"}
{"text":"I don't understand the lower reviews.   Admittedly, you are not here for the atmosphere. But the restaurant was clean and everyone was very nice. 

My friend and I had the pulled pork sandwich and it was AMAZING!  Very smoky, not too sweet.  The sauce (which you can add yourself) was vinegary and smoky and just a little sweet.  Our other friend had the BBQ chicken breast.

Sides were also good. We had baked beans, mac and cheese, coleslaw.

I wish the menu was larger--rib tips and more dinner plate type options would've been good. But the food was excellent!"}
{"text":"Sure do love some Honey Bears!  Cheap tasty eats for us carnivores.  Luckily for me, this location is 5 minutes from my work making it one of my favorite lunch break spots.  I would give it an extra star if it had the cool ambience of the Van Buren location but alas, it feels like a 1980's fast food joint."}
{"text":"The Real Deal

I'm from East Tennessee and our BBQ is North Carolina style.
After moving out to Tempe in '95 I thought I'd never see good BBQ but Honey Bear's changed that, they could hold their own in the South.
Honey Bears is N Carolina -style BBQ and the real deal., not cooked with spice/sauce until you put it on the meat.
Go for the Pork! this is what they do, skip the beef and chicken, it's for the BBQ illiterate.
Same with the folks who complained about having to put the sauce to the meat or not having fries, you do not know Southern BBQ.
For those who do, enjoy!"}
{"text":"The first time I went here, I was living at some apartments just down the road at Papago park.  I had only lived in Phoenix a couple years and where I come from there wasnt much in the way of BBQ so I didnt know anything about it other than I've had ribs before.  

I walked up to the counter and a very large black man hears me say \"Uhh, I'd like to get a rack of beef ribs please\".  
He barks back \"Boy, you dont want no beef ribs.  What you want is pork ribs\"
Being the skinny half Korean kid I was, all I could say was \"Yes sir\"

I'll tell ya, that changed my life.  Pork ribs, especially the ones from Honey Bear, make beef ribs taste like a McDonalds McRib sandwich."}
{"text":"This is right around the corner from me so we decided to try it as we wanted some BBQ. The first time our order got messed up but the BBQ sauce and greens brought us back. The second time was atrocious. The chicken is DRY. The ribs have no flavor. Mac n cheese is disgusting along with the coleslaw. The beans, bbq sauce, and the greens are delicious so I will give them that. Also the owner himself is so nice but his son or whoever works the front area is NOT pleasant. He does not listen and when you tell him he made a mistake he says oh well I didn't ring that up or no you didn't say that or just negative stuff to not make him look at fault."}
{"text":"Recommended by Sheraton hotel staff this was a welcome surprise. The BBQ was awesome , i had the chopped beef and it was great. The BBQ sauce was awesome, and the service was very friendly. A definite place to visit when in Pheonix"}
{"text":"We have used several Groupons for this location and enjoyed it both times!  The first time we ordered two different meals and neither of us came close to finishing the whole meal.  The second time we learned and ordered the Rib and Chicken plate ~ $19 and shared it (with plenty left over still!).  

Also on the second go around it was cool enough to sit outside and enjoy the view! Traffic and people watching is great from the outside spot.  

Overall: A-
Not a bad deal if you grab a deal and want a night out."}
{"text":"Average BBQ joint. I had a pulled pork sandwich combo with coleslaw. The meat tasted good, but it lacked a Smokey flavor and almost seemed like it may have been cooked in a crock pot. Sauce was okay, not sure if it's made in house or not. I think I'll try the location on central before eating here again."}
{"text":"Dude. Seriously. Good eats. I like fast cars, fast women, and fast service. Honey Bears is just that. Err, i mean.. Whatev. The ever-so-popular BBQ Pork Sandwich was the juiciest its ever been today. Add the seasoned fries and wash'er down with the RC Cola with crushed ice. I say \"Damn, son.\" Ima fixin' ta look at dem ribs ya'll talkin' 'bouts.  I turned southern all of a sudden."}
{"text":"Honey Bear BBQ is wet, messy, forget-yer-in-Arizona, hose yourself down with gallons of ice-tea when you're done, fun. The meat is so tender they must be getting it from animals who can't even stand up. The flavor of the sauce is a nice balance but leans a bit heavy on the sweet. But if this surprises you, you've simply forgotten the name of the place.
Try any of the meat, and don't miss the beans. They taste like something went horribly wrong in the pot and someone tried to cover it up with ladle-fulls of honey, and just before throwing the whole mess out, realized \"This is pretty damn GOOD!!!
I'll go there every chance I get, but if you don't like sweet messy BBQ stay away."}
{"text":"Very good BBQ joint.  Cheap and no frills, just like it should be.  Maybe I'm just lucky, but I have yet to be disappointed by Scottsdale cuisine!"}
{"text":"I thought they were a little stingy with they BBQ sauce, and the buns were sub-par. Still the flavors were good and I really liked the sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"We've been eating at this location for 14 years. The last two visits, including today, the place has been absolutely filthy. The food was horrible and they were even out of pork. Made the mistake of going into the bathroom to wash my hands before I left..... I can't even describe how filthy it was."}
{"text":"Had lunch here twice now and their BBQ sandwichs are very taste but definetly messy. First time I tried pork and this time I tried the chicken. Both were good. I recommend this if your in the mood for BBQ. I'm still dying to try their ribs but I don't think I could eat that much for lunch. The one thing I don't care for is their soda product. They have RC Cola! This is the only place I know that does'nt have coke or pepsi,, so I guess they are behind the times in the beverage department. But if your looking for good BBQ you should definetly try this place. Just make sure you grab some napkins!!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE experience. Got a couple of the Groupons thinking it was a good deal and bc my dad grew up in Phoenix and we used to come here a while ago for their formerly good food and service. However, we will never be back again and opted not to even use our balance because of how poorly we were treated. The Groupon actually expired yesterday and I was really tired but was going to make the 40 minute drive anyways but I thought I'd call and just check to see if they would extend the offer til today as some company's are courteous in that way. I spoke to a gentleman on the phone and explained that I knew my Groupon was expiring that night but would they let me come today for the deal and he said yes that would be fine. So today I make the drive and was told \"no\" by the girl behind the counter. I explain the whole situation about calling last night and that I spoke to a guy and she just said \"I know who you spoke to but that's not our policy so you can't get the deal.\"  No apology or attempt to rectify the situation.  I should probably add that there was NO ONE there and she could have easily extended our offer and established return customers but she had no custom service skills. When I asked her name she said it is Courtney but it looks like she has replied to reviews on here as \"Anna S.\" so who knows. And after reading more reviews about ppl who have gotten food poisoning after eating here recently maybe it's for the better!"}
{"text":"I was a little disappointed in the bbq; it was a little dry on my visit. The hot links were delicious, but a little too spicy. Regular smoked sausage would be a VERY welcome option for those of us who would not like to burn off their tastebuds but enjoy a good porky item. The bbq sauce is very good, but could benefit with a touch more sweetness and less pepper flakes.

Generally I love spicy food, but too spicy can be distracting and can sometimes send you to the bathroom repeatedly for a few days! Lol

Now, the good stuff. Mac and cheese can be heavenly, but the quality has been inconsistent over many visits. Some days, it is considerably less creamy and fresh than others. When its done right, I could make a meal of it. 

The potato salad is tangy, delicious, and the sides are a substantial, which is appreciated. 

I was sad to see they took off the delectable little corn muffins they had briefly on the menu :( good cornbread can be hard to find.

Be careful not to back over other patrons in the parking lot! Its a little tight! Lol"}
{"text":"Food was okay BBQ brisket sandwich wasn't bad ...Mac & cheese was a little runney for my likening ...  Hot link wasn't really a hot more like a sausage link.."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in years and wanted to see if they still were doing catfish on Friday ... called 6 times in a 30 minute period and no one answered the phone."}
{"text":"The barbeque itself here is good without being outstanding, but the barbeque sauce is bomb diggity. And those aren't words I kick around lightly, folks. When I say bomb diggity, I mean business. 

And this is another one of those places where I feel like the soda fountain is really on point. Try and find a better diet pepsi. Call me crazy, but they know what they're doing over here at the Honey Bear's."}
{"text":"Came in to order a barbecue feast to eat and watch game 7, however, there was not enough meat left in this joint to order a feast:(. The biggest disappointment is that I completed a huge order just to have another employee come from the kitchen and tell me, \"Sorry we don't have x,y, and z.\" So since the bbq joint had no bbq, I ordered a hot link sandwich and left. The sandwich was average, the service was quasi-average, and the organization of this restaurant was well below average. I'm hesitant to return."}
{"text":"I'm a long time fan of this Tennessee style 'que. In all fairness I'm fiercely loyal to the pulled pork and almost never have anything different. On the rare occasion I tried something else I enjoyed it, but I usually just do the half pound of meat w/ beans & slaw. It's honestly one of my favorite meals of all time. The Van Buren location is preferable. 

This place is the real deal."}
{"text":"i used to visit this place a lot when i worked in the area, oh say, 4 or 5 years ago, and i got it again today for the first time since then and i don't remember it being this mediocre.

lunch time, the place was packed. the line moved fast and my order go to me in a decent amount of time. i chose the bbq pork with fries and my friend suggested i get the peach cobbler. their bbq sauce is pretty good, but they don't actually put it on the sandwich. i prefer my bbq pork sandwiches to be soaked and dripping with juicy wet goodness upon first bite, but i got exactly the opposite. the meat was very dry and tough in most places. the fries were ok. the peach cobbler was warm but nowhere near sweet enough for a good peach cobbler - rather bland. 

you can find better bbq in phx, try stacy's on indian school and 17th."}
{"text":"this place actually deserves 3 1/2.


Like the sauce, like the bake beans. they put kilbasa in the beans I think.  I like going there, and it is right near work.  Ribs, chicken, are all good, though I do wish it fell off the bone a bit more. (personal preference)

Not best bbq i have ever had but certainly decent and enough to go back often."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite BBQ sauce.  Dreamy.   I always order the pulled pork or chicken sandwich and halfway through I ditch the bread to get closer to the delicious meat and sauce.  :) 
Also, this is my go-to for catering office events.  They're super professional and I always get glowing reviews from my customers."}
{"text":"Never heard anything bad about this place so I came to try it out now that I work in the area. Ordered the #1 combo pulled pork with a side of Mac and cheese for $11 and change. I've gotten in the habit of tasting my food before adding anything on to it, that was a mistake! Meat is bland and tasted completely unseasoned, it was actually watery like it was boiled not slow cooked and pulled. Thank God we ate there cuz the bbq sauce is for dine in only and I was able to douse the meat in sauce. Mac and cheese was good but the sandwich was so off-putting I couldn't finish it. Also, I'm not sure if the a/c was broken but I'm fairly certain it was cooler outside than in, and it's the middle of July in Arizona! I give 2 stars for the mac and quick service.  I won't be coming here again, maybe I'll try Philly's next door."}
{"text":"For a company that specializes in BBQ, their sauce is on par and very nice; however, that's the only great thing about this place. Much like others who have commented before, the ribs were tough and grizzly. They did my seem to have been slow cooked to perfection, more microwave for fast-good delivery. 

Not a fan..."}
{"text":"i'm confused.  i tried this place without looking at a review and i give it a 2 star.  but honey bears has a 4 star rating.  that's why i'm confused.  not sure if it was a bad day or what is going on.

the food was average to below average.  i did finish my food but that was about it.  my family was not to impressed either.

the inside experience was okay too.  after we left this restaurant we decided to never come back again.  but after reading so many positive reviews i'm may give it a second chance."}
{"text":"I didn't want to believe the bad reviews...but they are true. We had eaten honey bears ribs frequently 10-15 years ago. Hadn't been in such a long time. Read the reviews, but still had to give it a chance. My husband and I ordered a pulled pork and a beef brisket sandwich. The meat was flavorless. The pork was fatty. The bottom bun was practically liquid. Really unpleasant. My husband didn't want to eat his pork. I told him to just pour the sauce on it and he said the sauce wasn't any good. I have to agree. Back in the day, HBs had the BEST bbq sauce. Now, not so much. So disappointing (and expensive)."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place completely by accident. We were driving around the area trying to find a spot to eat. I'm glad we ended up in the complete wrong place looking for something else. The BBQ was pretty good but in my opinion the best part were the sweet potatoe tater tots. They were perfect. They were crispy but not overly done and nice and sweet. The staff were very friendly and I dug the laid back atmosphere and the good eats."}
{"text":"This is legit, I ordered combo #2 at 2:45 pm 3-1-14 and at 3:40 pm I had to walk to the counter and ask how much longer my food was going to be, the reply was 5 minutes there is one order ahead of you.
NO \"i am sorry for the wait, let me see whats taking so long.\" Nothing.
I replied with you have three minutes or I want a refund. Well 5 goes by, Ok I want a refund. It took about another 5 minutes for him to get permission from his \"manager\" whom may or may not have even graduated high school. At this point I have been robbed 1 hour of my life, with no apologizes, with no interaction with management, or any  sense of customer service.  
There would be a zero star here if i had the option. Absolutely yummy food, when properly serviced. 
I mean their was not one single resemblance of an adult in this establishment. Its like they all got high in the back and had no sense of time, or surroundings. I understand if you have a few new people that you are training. But WTF....
Oh and on the way out some one told me calm down...Me calm down you robbed my of an hour of my life, made me hungrier than what i was, and told me to calm down. That is not how you deescalate a situation. 
Never again Honey bears will I treat you to my hard earned money. And frankly the gentleman before me should have been more furious than me, he called in his order and sandwich with whatever side, you handed him a bag with a side of sauce, no apologizes for him or any of your other LOYAL customers. Dam I am MAD.
                                    Thanks for nothing, 
                                                       Augustina AKA ROBBED"}
{"text":"A coworker of mine RAVES about this place so when they came up on Groupon I jumped on it. It timed out perfectly to be the place where I had my goodbye lunch for my last week at work. I have to say, I was not dissappointed. I had the pulled pork and the beans and it was delicious. The portions were perfect for me, I left completely full but not uncomfortable. It was a great lunch but I can't say it was the best barbeque I ever had which is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"I got the brisket sandwich combo with Mac and cheese.   The meat was awesome.   The sauce is a vinegar based aside which was okay but not my favorite.  I didn't care for the Mac and cheese.   My biggest complaint was the dining experience was ruined by the flies.   They are all over.   Landing on my table and my food and eventually my face too.   I would go back but but would probably get take out and a different side."}
{"text":"Not so sure about the employees working here. When I came in the guy working the counter was sitting down doing nothing in particular even though the napkin dispenser was completely empty and a few things around the store looked like they could use some cleaning.

He was reasonably polite in taking my order, but certainly not above and beyond.

After taking a couple orders he went right back down to sitting on his stool.

If he has a doctor's note or some disability, I sincerely apologize for my review, but I strongly believe that in a restaurant 'if you got time for leaning, you got time for cleaning' and any time I see employees sitting around with obvious things to be attended to I have to worry about other practices in the kitchen.

The BBQ was pretty decent. Not the very best, but no complaints either. Beans were top Notch."}
{"text":"I like the sauce here a little better than BBQ Company.  This is a little more vinegar while BBQ Co is sweeter.  The pulled pork sandwich at lunch is one of my favorites."}
{"text":"Friendly service. Terrible location. The ribs & chicken combo with 2 extra sides was enough for us two ladies to make two full meals out of. My favorite sides were the Mac and Cheese, and the potato salad. Collard greens didn't have a ton of flavor & the cobbler was more bread pudding texture. The flavor of the bbq sauce makes up fo my negative feedback, we will definitely be returning to Honey Bears BBQ."}
{"text":"I've been going to this particular one since 1987.  It was a ritual to go there right after the Copper World race, Indy car race and  the races at Manzanita.  Great food, great portions and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service at this location. Always an attitude at the counter when a younger brother serves.  It's like they hate other black people. Angry looks and never a reply to a thank you.  Better service at the Van Buren location, but less sauce there."}
{"text":"Came to this location a few years ago and haven't been back since. It wasn't that it was \"bad,\" it's just that, as far as the nationwide spectrum of barbecue goes, this is just not that good. But, for whatever reason, Arizona is just a tough place in which to get good barbecue.
It's a busy corner, now (wasn't when I was there) right in front of the light rail in a decidedly office area. So, the lunch crowd is heavy. The place looks like it used to be a taco, cheesesteak or other fast food joint and had minimal renovations done. It's small and gets pretty crowded.
I got a brisket sandwich, which is sort of my own litmus test when it comes to BBQ. Prices were about what I would expect to pay. IIRC, my sandwich was about $6-7. Sides were extra.
The sandwich was okay. The brisket had a nice flavor, but wasn't fabulous, and I didn't think a whole lot of the sauce which, to me, is really the best part of good barbecue (although I know it's not pure barbecue).
But, regardless, this is still the best BBQ I've found in Phoenix. There used to be a place in Tempe called Big City, which was just fabulous. But they moved out to Mesa and went out of business near the beginning of the year. So we're left with a bit of a void and, now, you can find better BBQ at random festivals from booths, and even here in Tucson. But, if I'm really craving a great brisket or a spectacular slab or ribs or a plump, perfect sausage, I have to head east to Texas. There's just no comparison."}
{"text":"Loving located on notorious Van Buren, this hole-in-the-wall BBQ spot is legit one of the best places I've found in AZ. Obviously when you go for BBQ, you go for the meat and sauce. My chicken sliders could not have been more perfectly cooked and the sauce was just the amount of spicy, sweet, and overall delicious. My roomies had nothing to complain abouut their pork sandwiches.
Definitely filling alone without the sides too, so it's hang for your buck.
My only complaint would be the sassy guy at the register."}
{"text":"Okay, totally ecstatic about the Big Red! And the pulled pork, was juicy, tender and just down right good.The mac and cheese wasn't too cheesy but it had a nice pepper season to it... it was delicious. Because we got our order to go they put the sauce on the side so we can pour it on to our liking. I use the whole of sauce. It's sweet but with a spicy lil kick/aftertaste. I know of very few BBQ spots that have left a positive taste in my mouth and this is one for future reference to hit up if I'm looking for a good hole in the wall BBQ spot."}
{"text":"I would give Honey Bears 3.5 stars if that were possible but it just wasn't quite 4 stars.  The ribs were delicious and my friends pork sandwich was better than expected and not over-sauced, which is usually the problem with bbq joints.
But the service was slow and even though it wasn't very busy the staff just didn't seem like they were in a hurry to get us our food but were to busy talking to each other.
We will give them another try though."}
{"text":"Honey Bear refused to honor a Groupon even though it clearly stated on the Groupon that the amt paid for it NEVER expires. Employee was extremely rude and would not read the language on the Groupon. Stay away from a business that won't honor it's commitments."}
{"text":"The BBQ pork is fantastic but here's their best kept secret .... 

CATFISH YUM! 

This location serves Catfish fillets on Thursday and Friday. I wish it was everyday! They use a deliciously seasoned cornmeal NO flour! It is light and crisp and my fav! It is served with a great hot sauce and sweet moist dinner rolls. Fries and Cow-bro beans go great but you have your choice of sides. If you love a good catfish in cornmeal, I dare you to find any better in this town without making it yourself. I give Honey Bears 10 stars for their catfish **********. I grew up in the Midwest and we had catfish almost every Friday and this tastes just like home. 

Trust you will not regret this fish!"}
{"text":"I just have one thing to say WINGS!!!! Wing Wing Wa, Wing Wing,Wing Wing! This location has the best BBQ wings. Go for the BBQ Wings and an Ice cold beer! And you can watch sports there TOO.

Unfortunately I have not been down to this location in a long time. I am closer to the Central location and go there regularly for the Friday FISH Fry! The Central Location serves up the best Catfish in town! 

****They deliver for Catered orders."}
{"text":"WOW!!!!  This place has really lost it's touch.  I remember the days when my friends and I would celebrate eating here. Now I doubt I will be back.

I came here and experienced and witness some of the worst service.  What made it worse was the fact that my pork sandwhich was dry as hell.  

The only reasons I am leaving 2 stars is because of the fond memories I had of honey bears back in the early 2000's and the fact that their sauce is still amazing. Other than that I won't be back."}
{"text":"Don't know if they changed management but it has gone down. No AC, out of all fountain drink except diet which was flat. There was a sewer smell in the back dinning area. And was out of chicken only shredded and they got order wrong
I know we are not coming back."}
{"text":"I think it has started to go downhill a bit...then again phoenix is gaining more decent bbq places so I think that is part of why I just can't go any more.  Their is no smoke and not much flavor and the quality of the meat is not great. They get two stars due to a pretty decent bbq sauce and affordable pricing."}
{"text":"I have lived here for 16 years and have tried Honey Bears probably 20 times now.  Everyone raves about their barbecue but I can't say I agree.  The food has been consistently mediocre and the older lady that has been behind the counter for years, really does not seem to want your business.

If you just want some ordinary barbecue and this is close, it's not bad but if you are looking for something exceptional, you wont find it here. And honestly, the attitude of the woman behind the counter just isn't worth it."}
{"text":"Stopped in last week for what I thought would be a trip down memory lane; a real genu-ine BBQ place here in downtown Phoenix. 

This place was so off-base it actually made me frown. 

Maybe I've flown too high. Real BBQ for me was from an old man everyone called \"Knuckles\" on the side of the road in South Carolina sitting in a lawn chair next to a smoker painted like a pig. 

I ordered the 1/2 lb. barbecue pork with two sides. I tried the mac and cheese as well as the cole slaw. 

The pork was tough and had no smoke flavor whatsoever. The mac and cheese was watery, to the point where I wanted to ask if they poured in water recently. The cole slaw was ok, just bland. The sauce was alright.

I ordered a sweet tea because, come on, this is a barbecue place. The cashier told me they had RC products. No sweet tea? Get out of here.

Rivers Cuomo the cashier overcharged me for almost twice my meal. I just left and didn't go back. It wasn't even worth getting my money back."}
{"text":"Tried beef brisket sandwich. Came on a cold bun, with sauce. Enjoyed the beef, and sauce definitely a winner. Meat was chewy though, and could have been warmed up more. Mac and cheese average, needed salt."}
{"text":"So for around $5 you get a sandwich which consists of meat on bread and a teeny squirt of BBQ sauce. I added a side of slaw for $1.50 and it came in a cup the size of a side of ranch. 
You order your food and then they call out your number and you go get your food on a tray from the front counter. Like in a fast-food restaurant. No one is serving you. Why is there a line for \"tip\" on the receipt? 
Make your way down the counter and the soda fountain has RC and Big Red... now there's something you don't see everyday! 
My sandwich (pork) was dry as hell and featured more than a few rough edges in there, but not to worry, there is a giant vat of community BBQ (eek!) sitting next to the RC fountain. Oh, and the bun for the sandwich is pretty soft. The sauce is a bit sweet, no heat to it at all, no depth... no thanks.
Dirty tables, dirty bathroom with no paper towels left in the dispenser so I had to use a paper toilet seat cover to dry my hands. 
The cole slaw was tasty, tho. So... yeah."}
{"text":"This is the Honey Bear's no one knows. Its amazing that the staple of downtown Phoenix cuisine is so obscure here in what is essentially the heart of the sprawl that is Tempe/Chandler/Ahwautukee (Phoenix).

Nonetheless, Honey Bears still comes through, with some of the tastiest BBQ sauce I've ever had and a super tasty selection of meats with fries...so good!

The chicken cup is ridiculously good, it was my first intro to HB and I still don't know what its supposed to be called, its a cup of chicken with BBQ sauce! The sausages are perfect here! 

If you are passing by or live near here, check it out!"}
{"text":"The fam and I headed on down to Honey Bears this past Saturday to get our BBQ on! 

Honey Bears never disappoints! 

I had the shredded BBQ chicken sandwich with a side of the cowboy beans, sooo spicy and delicious! 

Also their french fries may be sent from heaven! SO GOOD! 

I always go for the Big Red at the soda machine, that is a rare soda to find on tap and Honey Bears has it! 

Thanks for another tasty lunch!"}
{"text":"30 minutes after ordering after ordering A chicken sandwich through Grubhub, I showed up to find that my order hadn't even been started. I had to wait around another 10 minutes as the staff suspiciously regarded me as a hassle before I had a bag unceremoniously passed off to me. The bone and tendon in the meat must have been mixed into the sandwich so there was some semblance of texture since the chicken tasted as if it had been steam cooked in a dishwasher. Their ketchup and vinegar \"BBQ sauce\" added a particularly vile aspect to this meal. This wasn't my first experience here, but it will be my last."}
{"text":"The food is good.  The coleslaw is really good.  I recommend never using a credit card.  At the Van Buren location... they always run it twice and it double charges sometimes.  I called them
them when I saw my bank ledger to fix it and their customer service was atrocious.  I will never eat there again personally.  That's just out of self respect.  It's sad.  I've eaten there since they opened and were donating all their proceeds to their church.  I wish them the best.  I'll find another place to go for BBQ"}
{"text":"Last Friday we tempted fate and headed over to Honey Bear's BBQ restaurant in Phoenix. We equipped ourselves with full kevlar body suits complete with knee cap armor.

During lunch hours it can be hard to find a parking slot at Honey Bear's Bar-B-Q restaurant. There are probably 20 spots and most of them fill up pretty quickly. From the outside, Honey Bear's looks as if it has had it's share of violence and has survived through it all. Fortunately enough, the inside makes up for the outside, but only in part. The restaurant is clean and the food appears to be prepared in a clean environment. But the whole building and the front part sure could do with a fresh coat of paint. That whole part of Phoenix is pretty runned down anyways. Honey Bear's is probably the best kept of its neighbors. Even so, don't attempt to gamble with your life and walk from work to the restaurant, you might get stabbed or shot at or both -- you've been warned.

Many people in our office love Honey Bear's and if they had the chance would go and eat there every day. Out of the three times I've been to Honey Bear's during two of them I've gotten a BBQ sandwich and the other time I got a salad. The salad was nothing to write home about and honestly I didn't expect it to be. The place specializes in Tennessee style BBQ and not in salads. So if BBQ doesn't turn you on, then neither will Honey Bear's. The BBQ sandwiches at Honey Bear's never seem to impress me though. It just reminds me of sloppy joe and honestly I'd rather have a sandwich made with Manwich than with their BBQ chicken. Manwich is at the very least \"managable\". The meat on the sandwichs at Honey Bear's seem to be all over the place. It is uncontrollable almost. Their is no picking your sandwich up and eating it. If you try, it is just a mess. You end up having to eat your sandwich with a fork. Com'on now, is that how the people in Tennesee eat their sandwiches? With a fork? Yea, it's true what their moto says, \"You don't need no teeth to eat our meat!\", but I can guarantee you, you'll need a fork.

As for food presentation, Honey Bear's doesn't do so well. Their sandwiches come wrapped in tin foil and the first impression you get is that there was no care put into it when they made it. They just plopted the meat on and moved on to the next customer.

I have heard through various channels that Honey Bears tastes like cafateria food. Atleast I'm not the only hater.

The price for food at Honey Bear's is about $5 just for the sandwich alone. With a drink and a side order of something it will usually run you about $8. The whole menu is pretty much a-la-carte.

We will probably visit Honey Bear's agian because my co-workers have a thing for BBQ. But honestly, I think that Honey Bear's reputation is far better than their food and food presentation."}
{"text":"Honey Bears is an experience.  I don't want to see how clean their kitchen is(n't), use the restroom or walk to my car in the dark alone, but I CAN'T GET ENOUGH!!!  It is the best BBQ around hands down!  I LOVE the pulled pork sandwich and would eat anything drenched in their bbq sauce.  Its sweet and spicy with the perfect touch of vinegar-i-ness.  You definitely need quite a few of the paper napkins to clean up with afterwards.  Actually, just take a shower.  

Their beans, coleslaw and peach cobbler are delicious too.  They also cater.  Its a dive, but TOTALLY worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Got the pulled pork sandwich. The pork was good and so was the BBQ sauce. The bread was sub par. Macaroni was slightly undercooked and the cheese was a bit runny. The size of the pork sandwich was nice for the price. Next time, I'll just get meat by the lb."}
{"text":"Consistency.

That's what I love most about Honey Bears.

I'll disagree that \"you don't need no teeth\", but I will say that the chicken is juicy, the beans are incredible, and the hot sausage is amazing. Your sweet heat vinegar bbq sauce is delicious. Your service is fast, and you serve some off-brand sodas on tap, which makes me smile everytime.

But every time I have had a meal here, it has been tasty. Have I had better BBQ? Yes. However, your location and consistent experiences have kept me a fan. 

Smoke your ribs longer, please."}
{"text":"One of the best BBQ restaurants I've been too. The place looks a little run down, but it only adds character. Open late (til 9:30pm I believe) this is a quick, easy lunch or dinner for us.

My favorites are the BBQ beef sandwich, potato salad and the cobbler is great too. A definite must! And there are multiple locations throughout the Valley."}
{"text":"This place was ok , I'm not a BBQ fan but I've had better. I'd go here again if the bf wants to go but otherwise I'll pass. 3 stars cause they have Big Red and Rc soda fountain drinks !! Can't find that anywhere! And friendly employes :)"}
{"text":"I used to love this place. The service was always so-so but the food rocked. Today I was running late downtown and starving. I stopped at 2:10 pm. I was not happy. My chicken was semi- warm. My fries were burnt so bad they crunched. If I wasn't in a hurry I would of asked to have new ones. All of this cost $11.36 with drink. Man what a let down. I am ok with cost if I get a good meal but this wasn't even close. Yuck! I hope this is just a fluke."}
{"text":"I'm typically not a BBQ fan but after having a sample of Honey Bear's BBQ Chicken Sandwich at a street fair I'm now a believer. 

The sauce has a warm and sweet taste and the pulled Chicken looks to be all white meat and quite tasty.

The only things that suck: the buns instantaneously decompose under the liquid BBQ sauce (making it a fork dinner rather than a sandwich) ... also they don't have Coke or Pepsi (only Dr. Pepper for the cola selection)."}
{"text":"Ok I am conflicted  I previously said I would never go here again...EVER. because the service was horrendous.   My friend placed a phone order, we were told the order would be ready at 7:30 so that is when we showed up to pick it up, however they had not even started putting the order together.  The worker had me pay first.  When the order finally came  I was asked to go through the bag myself to ensure I had everything I hd ordered.  Remember I did not place the order.  Isn't it a given they would have my order written down?  The worker was not rude but he was indifferent.    What is the point of phone orders if your not going to prepare the order until the person arrives and pays?

That said.  The food was REALLY good.   I just can't deal with bad service."}
{"text":"* I brought the Groupon deal \"$10 for $20 worth of barbecue, sides, and drinks\" might as well while I travel on budget. I got here on Wednesday at 1ish, there are 3-4 customer eating at the table, no customer in line.  I ordered the ribs and chicken bbq. The sides are alright, the chicken is realy good. The ribs are so dry. But the bbq sauces are soooooo good. I love the bbq sauces. I won't not come back unless I have another Groupon deal. I will only get the chicken next time."}
{"text":"This is by far the best BBQ place in Phoenix IMO.  The only problem that I always ran into is what to get.  All the meats are smoked to perfection and the link are spiced just the way i like it.

The BBQ sauce is so good that I keep a gallon of this wonder in my fridge at all times.

Oh, and they also have Alcohol!!"}
{"text":"Came here after finding a voucher on Restaurant.com.  Very happy with our meal.  Friendly, quick service.  

I had the ribs and sandwich (chicken) combo with two sides (corn on the cob and mac n' cheese) and my husband had the three slider combo with a side of mac n' cheese.  All very tasty.  The gentleman behind the counter brought us some of their baked beans on the house and they were amazing.  

We'll definitely have to come back as we didn't have room for dessert!"}
{"text":"Cannot believe I have lived next to this place for years and never tried it! Went for lunch today and the sliders (one pork, one beef and one chicken) were AMAZING! Their mac n cheese was bomb too, not to mention the Big Red. Will definitely start eating here regularly."}
{"text":"Barely 3. Its kinda like a joke of a BBQ. May be you never had one? Maybe you are senile can not remember how BBQ should be? Maybe you never ever had any food before? Whatever the reason might be, i am not sure. All i do know is that place is pricey and not very good. It will extinguish your hunger but it does not taste good doing so. 

\"Bleah\""}
{"text":"I usually stop by here before I go to Suns/D-Backs games with my dad because I really enjoy eating BBQ, though I admit the food isn't outstanding.

I've tried both the pork and beef BBQ sandwhiches; they're both REALLY bland without the sauce. I eat a lot and I just like how they have large portions.

Some people might be turned off by the cleanliness of the restaurant, which can be best described as dingy."}
{"text":"Best beans I've ever had and an excellent BBQ sauce!!  Rib tips and chicken were great.  Coleslaw and potato salad ok."}
{"text":"I'd say 3 stars is pretty accurate. The 1/4 chicken and Mac n Cheese I had were decent.  Its average food.  The cashier needs to be nicer to customers. Overall, its alright, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there."}
{"text":"It's a solid choice for good BBQ. 
I had lunch here and brought home the chicken and rib platter for dinner. The staff is a little generic, but the point here is obviously all about the food. 
It doesn't disappoint but the portion size is a little light for the cost, especially since they surely don't pay very much for rent. 
I stop by whenever I'm in this side of town and it is definitely recommended."}
{"text":"The BBQ sauce is addicting.  Chicken and pork were both prepared well.   Beer was nice and cold, and they had more options than just the typical bud or coors.  Sweet potato fries, which they had forgotten at first, were also very good.  Corn on the cob was bad:  stale and kinda mushy.  It was either boiled for a couple days or has spent way too much time in a steamer to keep it warm.  I love corn on the cob, and this is the only time that I can recall that I didn't eat it.

+5 stars for the BBQ sauce and the overall meal.

-1 star for the corn on the cob."}
{"text":"decent bbq (gets waaaay more hype than it deserves really) that is hampered by the fact that i have gotten mediocre-to-bad service every time. i usually stick to only good reviews but this weekend was the last straw.

brother and i went in saturday 041214 to use a Groupon and it was a hassle- if you don't want to deal with Groupons, you can always, y'know, NOT SIGN UP WITH THEM VOLUNTARILY. then we were told multiple different prices with the excuse 'uh, certain specials aren't allowed to be used'. well a) that isn't noted anywhere b) the items ordered were on the menu, not listed as 'special' c) they told us we had to order the full amount to get the discount, which is not how ANY Groupon deal i have used works (ie, the $20 credit wouldn't kick in until we ordered $20 worth of food. yeah, what? its a $20 credit! if we ordered $18, that means its all covered, not that we need to buy another side we didn't want!)

on top of that, we only got half our order at first, my brother went to ask about his and was told he cancelled the other half of the order. the part that was paid for and on the receipt? at this point he was pretty annoyed and the on duty manager came out and was condescending and telling him to calm down. then was told that his order was being made fresh so it was gonna be awhile- only to have it come up right then. this trip didn't make sense and they didn't really seem to care. not really in a rush to go back ever at this point. your bbq is ok, but i can go to Astor House up the street and not deal with this kind of headache.

i am not a bitchy, crabby person, i deal with the public all day and as such try to be understanding when situations come up and things take a while...but this is not an isolated incident and their attitude about it sucks."}
{"text":"\"You don't need no teeth to eat our meat\"

Haha, what else needs to be said.

This place is a solid BBQ joint.  I'm from the southeast and I love pork BBQ.  I was raised on NC style (from southern VA) but I appreciate all BBQ's.  This place is pretty great.

It's inexpensive.  Decent customer service.  Cheap beer.  Very little fat/gristle in the pulled pork which is something I pay very close attention to.  

If you're looking for something quick, easy, inexpensive and delicious give this place a try."}
{"text":"I visited here for lunch once last year, and the meal was fine. Since it's close to my firm's Phoenix office, and I was in the mood for BBQ, I figured I'd try it again. Big mistake. 

First off, even though I arrived exactly at noon, they were already sold out of a number of sides, including corn bread. Moreover, they served me the very last serving of brisket. At noon!

The meat itself smelled horrible. Literally a faint odor of dog food. The sauce was quite good, and masked the scent somewhat, but I ended up throwing most of the meat out. I seriously wish that I'd thrown it all out, as the scent and taste lingered for hours. The coleslaw was prepackaged in the fridge, and tasted like it. The beans were actually quite good (earning a second star begrudgingly). 

The service was, umm, strange. Not friendly or unfriendly. Just uncomfortable. And I needed to wait about 10 minutes for my food, even though the place was almost empty. Did I mention it was noon?

Never again."}
{"text":"Talk about weak sauce. This place has dry. Dri. Drei. Dryyyyyy Pulled pork!  And drowning it in their boring sauce does not help things. In fact, given that they use seemingly store bought hamburger buns, drowning it in sauce makes it nearly impossible to eat.  Very sad pulled pork sandwich."}
{"text":"Went to central ave location. Dry pulled pork,you NEED teeth to try to eat it,rubbery,bun was soaked on the bottom with? Won't go back,waste of money,tables were dirty too."}
{"text":"Went for dinner tonight. The food was awful. 

I ordered a chicken and ribs combo. When they said the ribs were cooking and it would be 10 minutes, I should have walked out. When it finally came, it was just plain bad. The ribs were super tough and chewy. The mac and cheese was mushy, the collard greens were decent. They were the only thing I liked. Even the sweet potato pie was disappointing. Watery texture with a pumpkin pie spice flavor. 

But the biggest disappointment was the BBQ. There was zero smoke flavor. I threw half of my food out. When I walked out to the parking lot, I noticed they had two grills set up. I don't even think they were serving real BBQ. I think it was cooked on propane. All of the staff had Spanish accents. I think it may have changed ownership. I'm never going back. It was probably the worst BBQ I've had in Phoenix. Oh, and the bathrooms had no soap or paper towels. Gross."}
{"text":"This place SUCKS!!!!!
The kitchen is in complete chaos!
I ordered a 2 piece catfish dinner for $11.99 and a beef brisket sandwich for $6.99 for a total of $20 and change.
Waited 20 minutes until order was done. Got to my car realized my beef brisket was not in the bag. Went back inside waited another 15 minutes for a simple sandwich.

Got home and opened boxes and the 2 piece catfish dinner is one fillet cut in half to make 2 pieces... BS! Mac and cheese had NO cheese... lame.... beef sandwich bottom bun was completely
Soggy.....Will NOT be going back.....Stay away from this stupid ripoff place...."}
{"text":"It was my first time at Honey Bears. I went for lunch, so it was around 12:00.  They welcomed me in with a huge smile. The staff was really cool and gave me some suggestions.  I ordered the one meat and two sides meal. I got the pulled pork, the coleslaw, and the mac and cheese. When my order was called, they also gave me free ribs because I was a first timer and they wanted to see me come back. I thought that was really nice of them. The food was sooooo good. If you love old-school, messy, lick your finger BBQ you must check this place out. I love that it's rustic and old too. A very rare sight in Phoenix these day. I will return.... many times."}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday evening to answer a pregnancy craving for the wife. Placed order at 5:41 and didn't get our order until after 7. The BBQ isn't that amazing especially compared to other places in the valley. While we were there three people elected to get refunds rather than wait for their order to be filled. When they asked for an explanation regarding the wait the guy up front shrugged his shoulders and apologized. 

Again it's not mind blowing food and will definitely look elsewhere for BBQ before coming here in the future."}
{"text":"I went to Honey Bear's BBQ with some people from work. I just wasn't impressed. Every sandwich was on a (fairly soggy) standard grocery store hamburger bun. The insides were good, but nothing to write home about. The sides were ok, but not a single person finished, so that wasn't a ringing endorsement to me.

The thing that really soured me was that unless we ate outside, our party of more than 4 couldn't fit in any of the tables. In many places, eating outside wouldn't matter, but this in Phoenix and it was hot that day. 

I probably won't go back but if a group of people wanted to go there, it would be fine. It isn't so expensive that I would mind."}
{"text":"First off I am extremely picky when it comes to bbq. So I always go into a new BBQ joint with high expectations. I came here with my boyfriend and he just ordered for us. A full rack of ribs, mac n cheese, collard greens, and corn bread. I picked up my first rib and the meat quite literally fell off the bone. It was juicy and exploded with flavor. Collared greens were cooked to perfection, and the mac n cheese was perfect. Oh then while I wasn't looking my boyfriend decided to order a piece of sweet potato pie...and I am so happy he did. I will definitely be coming back to try as many things on the menu as possible."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try this place, but after going here today for lunch it will be my last time. First of all, impression is everything to me. The cashier was rude and I'm not sure if she even knew how snappy and rude she was to everyone. Some of the workers didn't look too happy to be working today which totally messed up my mood. I had the BBQ chicken sandwich and it was moist but not seasoned. The cashier ruined my experience and management needs to check her attitude!

Also, the volume on the radio needs to be turned down in the back. If you're waiting for your number to be called you can just forget about hearing them."}
{"text":"The chicken is good.  The sauce is great.  The sides are fine. The place is an uncharming bit of a dive."}
{"text":"I'm really torn between 1 and 2 stars. I've had the ribs before and they were fantastic, but today was my first experience actually eating in. I was extremely under-impressed with the customer service skills of the lady at the register. She was short, and it was evident she was irritated when I paused to order a side. I didn't get my drink cup and had to go back to the counter and ask for it. She very impatiently and rudely (with an almost accusatory tone) asked me if I paid for a meal. Not how I wanted to be treated. 

When I got to the table to eat, my side wasn't in the bag, and my experience with the cashier was bad enough that I didn't bother going back again for fear of receiving her accusatory tone like with my drink cup. 

Needless to say, while I thoroughly enjoyed my pork sandwich, I will not be going back to this establishment. It was evident they were either short staffed, or someone forgot to order supplies, because they were out of different meats and sides. While I can understand these situations may be frustrating, it's not the customer's fault and they shouldn't have to deal with it in sub-par customer service."}
{"text":"As I left the Heard museum parking lot and headed north on Central, I thought I might stop at Fez and try their Feb. pasta special.  (What I really wanted to do was to head over to Rose and Crown to meet with new acquaintances, but I didn't want to worry about parking...)  On the way, I spotted HBB on the left, but I kept going north for Fez.  However, it seemed like I'd never get there, so I gave myself a stopping point- if I hadn't reached Fez by the next light, I was going to turn around and interrogate the poor soul that happens to greet me at Honey Bear's.  

The poor soul's name was Rich, who informed me that HBB only has one sauce, and unfortunate for me, it contains *.  (I received the same response at the Glendale Chocolate Affaire, but I assumed the \"one sauce only\" was for convenience purposes.  See?  Never assume.)  He sold me on the fact that they marinate the meats in a spice and vinegar-based marinade.  Alright, I'll try a 1/2 pound (about $8 w/ tax) of pork (his fave) and beef (which the young man, who patiently waited behind me while I asked poor Rich so many questions, ordered after I stepped aside and considered my options).  No, wait, I'll have a full pound (about $15 w/ tax), and could you add chicken, too?  And bbq sauce on the side, please. 

While I waited for my take-out order, I asked Rich if I could sample the sweet potato pie, and to my surprise, he handed me a slice, told me to grab a spoon, and help myself!  It took only one teaspoonful of that slice for me to decide on purchasing a whole pie ($12) to go.  

So how did the meats taste w/o the bbq sauce?  The chicken was very bland and pretty dry.  The beef was not much better, but at least it had some mouth-feel.  The pork was the clear winner, esp. since its marinade had the added benefit of red pepper flakes.  Would I go back for more meat?  Unless HBB designs a non-* based-sauce, no.  Well, maybe for the pork.  And only if I was carrying a bottle of bbq sauce in my purse.

1 star each for the pulled pork, sweet potato pie, and for Rich being such a sport.  (Kudos for letting me sample the pie!  Letting people sample is always good for business!).  

p.s.  If HB had a shack that only sold sweet potato pie, I'd give it 5 stars!
p.p.s.  Honey Bear BBQ, please add candied yams/sweet potatoes to your menu!  While you're at it, add some sweet potato fries, as well!

Allergy update: I concluded that the sweet potato pie must contain * ingredients bec. I went through two days of horrible allergy symptoms.  I won't be able to enjoy it anymore, but for those w/out allergies, do give it a try!"}
{"text":"Not as good today as any other time i have been there in the last 25 years. The ribs were undercooked :(  The woman behind the counter didnt know what i was talking about when I couldn't eat the roll because it was wheat. She assured me it was 'white.\""}
{"text":"First and last time here...If I could give zero stars I would. I ordered 2 pulled pork combos and it was ready over an hour later. When I went to get it they only had 1 pulled pork sandwich cause they said they ran out of pulled pork....Very disappointed and will never be back"}
{"text":"Great BBQ, Sauce is great, Cole slaw is good, no complaints for me. It's a BBQ shack, so anybody expecting frills will be greatly disappointed. It's all about the food and that is great."}
{"text":"I'm so not impressed with this place at all...your 3 star rating is very over rated! The guy at counter was not welcoming at all. The pulled pork has got to be some of the worst I have ever had in my entire life! Never have I not finished a pork sandwich lol. Mac n cheese was okay mediocre the beans were the only thing good! I'm not sure how you all have the reputation you have maybe 25 years ago you were good!!"}
{"text":"I've had Honey Bears twice.  Both times I got the pulled pork sandwich.  I can't give the sandwich a passing grade.  These were from two different locations, and the same result.  The meat was unseasoned and bland...although juicy and tender enough.  The bun sauce is uneventful.  And for 5 bucks, I want better.
The first time I got a sandwich, it was bought to me from the Tempe location.  The 2nd time I went to the Central location.  The service was non-descript, which I guess isn't a bad thing.  The place looked nice, though.  Neat and clean.  And there were a lot of people eating, so the stuff is good to someone...just not me.  I figure if you can't get a pulled pork sandwich right, I'd be an idiot to try your ribs or chicken.  So, I guess Honey Bears is on my Nope-List.  Too bad, cause its so convient from work.  
I will, however, go back and try their catfish.  If they get that right, I'll throw another star at them."}
{"text":"This place should not be in business!
I thought this place looks like a dive, but the food COULD be really good.  The food was terrible.  I ordered 1 lb. each meat for take out.  The pulled pork, beef and chicken was rather dry and chewy.  The ribs were cold, dry, and very chewy.  I think the food has been stored too long and just reheated in the microwave.  Also, I asked if I could just order the ribs as meats by the pound for take out and no sides.  He said yes and then charged me the full dinner price and gave it to me without sides.  The sauce was this orange brown watery substance that I would not call BBQ sauce.  The final touch, is that their attitude and customer service is really BAD!"}
{"text":"Tasty tasty bbq.  Fall off the bone smoked chicken is my favorite here.  Good cowbro beans and collard greens.  I like the bbq sauce they use here too- tangy, not overly sweet, with a little bit of heat.  We usually split the chicken and ribs combo.  For $17.99, you get a sizeable plate of bbq chicken, ribs, and 2 sides."}
{"text":"That's what I'm talkin' 'bout! This place is not fully hood, but it is close. They have a large selection to chose from, and I wasn't sure what to chose until I saw a nice value menu. I finally chose the three slider option - a pork, a chicken and a beef. A large pot of sauce on the table provided the right amount of sauce to be added to the sandwiches. I was surprised at how quickly the order was ready. My friend ordered and as she was getting her soda, her number was called. 

The soda selection was another interesting feature. No Coke or Pepsi here - RC, Diet Rite, Big Red, Country Time, and Sunkist mark a few of the selections that do not appear on most restaurant menus. There is plenty of seating in the dining room.  A good selection of sides to chose from (I went with the potato salad).

The flavor of the meat was excellent and each slider was overstuffed. When you see the sandwich, you know you are going to wear it - which is another sign of a great BBQ establishment. You will need plenty of napkins with this one! 

My first experience here will not be my last. This place has jumped near the top of my list of BBQ pursuits."}
{"text":"Excellent BBQ at excellent prices. Been driving passed this for months and finally stopped in with my girl and some friends. The pulled pork sandwich was about the best I've had in Phoenix. The sauce is good with a bit of spice. Clean environment, if not a little older. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I've gone to Honey Bears now twice. First time was when I was a teenager with my grandparents. Was not impressed. Since it had been st least 15 years, I figured is give out another go. Honestly, I've made better bbq at home. For the price they charge you, of rather go to Famous Daves. 

Pork was dry. Ribs were fatty. Cobbler was gluey and tasted like it was Comstock pie filling. 

Thank goodness we ate using a Deal Chicken offer."}
{"text":"So good. One of the best tasting BBQ I have had in a long, long time. 

Must try!!!!"}
{"text":"Been craving Honey Bears for a while now, finally drove up from Tucson and got my fix. My signature order is a pulled pork sandwich for any BBQ place I go. Honey Bear's did not disappoint, the pork was seasoned very well and was juicy. The sauce is more on the sweet side and not too thick. The mac n' cheese was very creamy and seasoned with pepper. I am a pepper person so I do not mind the little kick. Tried a rib and the small amount of meat that was on there came right off. Seasoned and cooked very well. I am not one to order ribs so I don't want to be too critical of them because they were very good, just thought they were a bit slim. 

If you happen to catch a Cardinal's game in Glendale, Honey Bear's has a quick service stand INSIDE the stadium. Definitely a good game choice meal."}
{"text":"I feel bad giving them 2 stars, the first time I went I LOVED the bbq, so good, so tender.  Second time I went, same thing, BUT I got food poisoning!  A busy, well known place like that shouldn't have that happen.  I'm never eating there again."}
{"text":"First time here.  I'll give credit where it's due, they have apparently been reading the reviews because the staff made an extra effort to be friendly and courteous. 

I had 2 bbq beef sandwiches because they were out of the pulled pork.  While eating my sandwiches I had the thought there should be laws enacted to constitute what restaurants can call bbq.  Boiled meat covered in BBQ sauce is NOT BBQ.  
I grew up in the South, I've been to Memphis in May a couple of times, so my standards for BBQ are admittedly higher than average, but this was not even close to real BBQ.

Was it decent food.  Sure.  Decent, at best.  Was it the reason I got an upset stomach a couple hours later, possibly.   I don't care about the old decor, dirty looking bathrooms or anything else, if the food was good I would go back.  It wasn't."}
{"text":"Been going to Honey Bear's for around seven years and it is the BOMB! It is my favorite bbq place. I suggest you try it, especially if you like wet and saucy bbq. When Jesus comes back, I expect to see Honey Bear's Sauce ascend home :D
If you want good BBQ and a no glits and glammour dinning room, you've found it."}
{"text":"This place has really delicious BBQ. I would have given it a 5 if the chicken wasn't a little dry and the interior of the facility was a little neater and cleaner. I'm not saying it was dirty, it's just the trashy sign on the fountain drink saying not to put stuff in the drain. I also didn't like the \"real\" trash can being turned around so there's no access to the door and a large \"kitchen\" grey trash can sitting right beside it. All in all a good visit, but not a 5."}
{"text":"Sad I didn't try the ribs they looked really good. Instead I went with the pulled pork sandwich which was good but not worth the price. 

Not too impressed and left feeling like I had paid too much for an alright lunch."}
{"text":"\"Put some south in yo mouth\" Boooyaaa~

Pretty darn good BBQ. I had the pulled pork sandwich, the meat was tender and I could really taste the hickory smoke. The sauce was thick and tangy (yes I went a little overboard with it). I got corn on the cob for the side and it was a little bland, as if it had been boiled too long. My friend opted for the catfish and I snuck a few bites, it was not over-breaded, just a thin light dusting and super juicy inside, next time I am going to order it. I had an ice tea and it was so strong I had to add water to it (which I love). Overall this was a great lunch and although I ate so much I almost put myself in a food coma I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The best BBQ on the planet. If I lived closer I would be a fat slob."}
{"text":"Bought a groupon for this place.  $10 for $20 worth of food.  Went on a Saturday morning and it wasn't too busy.

I ordered the half rack of ribs ($13.99) which came with six rib bones and two sides (I got sweet potato fries and coleslaw).  The ribs were tender and the fries were delicious.  The coleslaw, eaten by my fiance, was just okay.  He got the pulled pork sandwich ($5.99) and enjoyed it.  It was messy but good he said.  We shared a drink and wound up only having an additional $4 and change to pay on our bill.

This was a yummy lunch and the groupon made it even more awesome.  Worth a visit!"}
{"text":"First review but not the first time here.

Originally came here because well I did enjoy the Van Buren location.  On a day that well, I wanted Quantity over Quality.... A point I will explore soon.

Upon entering I had already referenced the other reviews of this location. Seemed about average so naturally i prepared myself to not be impressed.

First things first.  The place was a bit of a mess (being gracious with my language). I understand it was at the end of their lunch rush but still... if your a staple of any city your image is very important so Tidy Up! Also there is nothing wrong with the idea of a remodel in certain areas like the bathroom and table area. 

*I almost always suggest an open kitchen for any eating establishment. I mean who wouldn't enjoy seeing my meats being cooked and smoked as I am contemplating my order at the register? right?

Price... a bit overpriced for the QUALITY I received and even the QUANTITY was not what I expected for what I paid.

Ordered the Pork sandwich meal with Sweet potato fries. Pork was dry and burnt, flavorless too, which I'm sure is easy to get away with since anyone who is in there usually sloshes their sandwiches in that BBQ sauce... not good enough for me or most foodies I'm sure. The fries where and had been frozen obviously, ughh.... like really? and to top it off they were also bland (doused them in BBQ sauce just like my sandwich to try to save them)

My girlfriend and her mom had ordered the same thing. but with different sides. Her Mac n Cheese looked awfully fast food/michelina's of them. Also to top it off after being home for about an hour or so and even through the rest of the evening me and m'lady felt awfully sick (Not a surprise considering if you take a gander into the kitchen from the soda fountain it looks like quite a mess back there....)

I will not be visiting again on my own account but also some people I lunch with are stuck in their ways. Id like to see a remodel, food quality improved to reflect proper pricing, CLEANLINESS (not just at my table when i have to clean it myself but in the KITCHEN) and well all those smiles people are saying they do not see there will come to the employees naturally. I see some obvious pride lost in the owners and employees alike.

I never like to see a business fail. Especially one that has such a familiar name her in Phoenix. Best of luck to you guys."}
{"text":"Called & Called & Called...No one picked up the phone during business hours which is very unprofessional and a inconvenience on my part. I cannot understand people who go into business to service people, and they ignore the customer. This is very LAZY service. Big Disappointment"}
{"text":"I've been slipping by here for over 25 year's .  l moved to LA 17 years ago .  brought the fam in today what a complete disappointment........ The hot links were boiled not grilled...... I asked why and the Asian lady said the grill wasn't on yet.  I asked why she didn't mention the fact the grill wasn't on when I ordered them she said she would check if the lady in back could warm them up, I exploded!!!! I asked if the place changed hand and she said NO....... In the past the boys bent over backwards to please. Not today, not one bro there.  I told her to take it back, no apologizing nothing....... I even left a 15% tip when I payed at the counter before I had to pick up my food.... Sad to say never again........ The bros should pay attention to this website as it would help their business greatly.  By the looks of it only the reviewers care.  The brisket  was great, half chicken was dry, corn mushy, and the ribs were good."}
{"text":"I actually was pretty impressed with this place, the collared greens weren't impressive on this particular visit.  Last time, they were amazing but we went an hour before close (7pm) and they weren't cooked well, I'm sure it's usually better earlier. The rack of ribs was good as usual, friendly staff, Mac and cheese was alright.. 

I like the old fashioned style of Honey Bears, reminds me of the scenes in House of Cards where Frank goes to Freddies for ribs...that's why I like this place. I feel that the sweet potato pie should have been heated up but it tasted fine. 
They serve beer. They serve cornbread and peach cobbler. Collared greens and cowbro's baked beans. 

Major knock on what they should but don't offer: Sweet Tea... this is a southern place that has no sweet tea...so that was my only let down."}
{"text":"Honey Bears is where I go for my quick meat fix and I'll tell you why.  It is conveniently located near my house, and I have no doubt that this is true of everyone who is reading this review on Yelp, and they have lots of meat.  If for some reason you are unsure of what to order, let me break it down for you.  Order the choice of two combo sandwich with pork and hot links with a side of fries.  Skip the soda because soda is unhealthy.  But if you have to get a soda, get the Big Red.  Isn't that cool, they have Big Red.  Why pork?  I tried the beef once, and let me just tell you that it is no pig.  Why hot links?  It is the closest thing they have to sausage.  What you do is take the half with the hot links and eat it first.  Just dip the whole open faced sandwich into the BBQ sauce and eat it one delicious bite at a time.  After savoring the hot links, you'll realize that you still have half a sandwich left, but that you are a little buned out.  So instead of eating the other half of your sandwich the same way you just ate the hot links, what you need to do is take each French fry and use it like some nan or pita to scoop up some of the pork, dip it into the BBQ sauce, and eat it.  The fries have way too much salt, but that just seems to make them taste better than those fries that have just a lot of salt.  You may need to drink a gallon of water after the meal, but let me tell you this, you won't be hungry.  In fact, you may have a little bit of a stomach ache if you weren't able to stop when realized that you were full.  It happens and you'll still be thirsty.  But you won't be hungry."}
{"text":"I came here today because I was in the area and wanted something different. I've heard about them before, but never been into their place until now.

It wasn't the worst, but honestly, I wasn't all that thrilled.  I was hoping for more.  When I walked in, the place was empty!  There was one guy sitting and eating in the corner.  I will say that its because today is Christmas Eve, and everyone's out doing other stuff getting ready for the holiday.

So, I walk in and go to the register to order.  I had a few questions since I'd never eaten here before, but the girl behind the register was inputting stuff in and asked me to hold on for a moment.  I waited a few minutes for her to finish, but it felt like forever.  I was hungry and just wanted to eat.  Anyways, she takes my order, and I went with one of their combos.  I got a Brisket sandwich, mac and cheese, along with a pop to drink.  

The food was done quickly, but I left feeling kind of let down.  The mac and cheese was soupy, and had quite a bit of pepper in it.  I ate about half and threw the rest away. Normally I would take something like that home and snack on it later, but I didn't care for it, so I chucked what I I didn't eat.  The Brisket itself was okay, but the BBQ sauce had no kick to it.  I don't mean that it was mild...but it had no taste.  Plus, they didn't put a lot of sauce on, so that half my sandwich didn't have BBQ sauce on it.  :-(

Normally, when I eat at a BBQ place, they have additional bbq sauces either in squirt bottles on the table, or in a vat somewhere in a central location for you to add on if you would like more.  There is also usually some kind of variety to choose from.  Tangy sauce, maybe a hotter bbq sauce, etc.  All I saw was a vat near the napkin area, but it wasn't labeled and I didn't trust putting in on my food.  I didn't know what it was.  I assume it was extra sauce, but I don't know that for sure since there wasn't a sign.  

Also, the place was FREEZING.  Look, I'm from Michigan and have a pretty thick skin for cold.  But, the last few days, its been quite cold outside, even for Arizona standards.  30 something degrees and night, with a high in the upper 50's to 60's during the day.  Most places have the heat on.  Well, not at Honey Bears.  No heat. I could feel that the cold had seeped in, and I wasn't wearing a coat, and wished I had.  fail.

Overall, I didn't like this location, but I am open to trying the other locations in the future, and hope to have a better experience next time."}
{"text":"Good wholesome BBQ, but they were out of collard greens :-( The cornbread muffins weren't the best either, but the brisket and cowboy beans are worth coming for."}
{"text":"Not real impressed.  Sauce wasn't all that and sliced beef was tough. Trash can was full, restaurant wasn't real clean. Two small sandwiches and two sides came to $20.   Won't be back."}
{"text":"The place is not the most inviting. Very cafeteria like. The ribs were delicious. The cole slaw was very tasty. The cook was very kind and generous with the portion of ribs."}
{"text":"quality in the food is inconsistent. i'm sure it depends on the cook of the day.

the only thing that consistently not dry and full of gristle is their pulled pork.

i have 2 groupons for this place and i'm hoping to try their catfish."}
{"text":"Pulled pork...tasty!  Cole slaw...crispy and fresh. Value...well worth the reasonable prices.  The place is a dive and never seems too terribly clean to me.  But who cares if the food's good?  The kind of place I will return to when I'm cravin' bbq and don't feel like a lot of fuss but I hesitate to recommend to others."}
{"text":"Only Eastern North Carolina BBQ gets five stars, but for Phoenix this is really good. I stopped here for dinner after work and before an appointment. I got there at a good time, because a line formed after I got my food. I enjoyed the pulled pork sandwich, and the mac 'n' cheese was creamy with just a touch of pepper that added a bit of zap. The sauce on the sandwich was good as well. 

I wish they had a pulled BBQ plate option with a couple of sides, but I didn't see that (unless I missed it). The sandwich was good, though -- I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Ambiance is a lot nicer, and restaurant is much cleaner than location on Van Buren. The last couple of times I dined at the Van Buren location were a tad weird. One time, a couple of friends and I were BSing in the parking lot, when a creepy guy in a half shirt approached and inquired to when the gay club next door opened. The last time, a dude that seemed like he was on something, was loudly tossing around profanities and asking for change-inside the restaurant.  
    Unfortunately the quality of the food at this Priest location is not even close. Decided to check out this location with my girlfriend after we purchased a Deal Chicken half-price voucher.  Cashier stated he could not accept my Deal Chicken discount after order was placed. Eventually rectified after much confusion. Food was ready at pick up counter very swiftly after transaction was completed. And that is where the positivity of the visit ended.
      We had a couple of combo meals to try a variety and everything was a disappointment. First tasted were the baby back ribs. They were not bad-tender and cooked decent. But the taste was bland. It's like they use a whole different cooking process then the Van Buren restaurant. None of the woodsy smokiness that weaves into the meat and outward to your taste buds. In fact, none of the meats possessed this quality. We also had chicken and pork sandwiches which were perfectly fine, but not up to the Honey Bear's standard, that has made them a Valley favorite for decades. 
     The side dishes were not an opinion changer either. We had macaroni and cheese that had a mushy consistency not unlike chunky mashed potatoes. Decent cheese flavor if it hadn't been doused in what seemed like half a shaker's worth of pepper. Similarly, the beans, which have always been some of my favorite legumes, were overwhelmed with the cook's over-anxious shaker arm. It even affected the BBQ sauce, which has always been a sublime combo of sweet and smoky with tender ham chunks. But with way too much spice, all the usual standout flavors are dismissed.  
     Lastly, for dessert a peach cobbler would end the subpar experience. Still piping hot when I popped the lid on the container 20 minutes after it was packed, I had hope. Again a letdown was in store. The cobbler at the bottom was disgustingly uncooked like a huge chunk of cookie dough with no sugar or tastiness. As a certified sweet aficionado, I do not dismiss any sugar products quickly. With this though, it was one bite and into the trash it went. Ok, more like two bites-just to be sure. A sorry end to a meal I approached with great anticipation. As one of my favorite BBQ brands, I will not give up on Honey Bears. It just may be awhile till I visit again. And it will be to the Van Buren location. And I will sit back, savor the taste, and enjoy the cast of characters there."}
{"text":"Not too impressed. The baked beans were way too sweet as is the BBQ sauce. So-so cole slaw and dry meat."}
{"text":"This place is da bomb!  This is my go to place whenever I'm in Phoenix.  Great food, great prices, great staff.  And the portions are huge so you'll never leave here hungry.  I've had the ribs, beans, sweet potato fries, and sweet potato pie and they are all great.  Now they just need to open a location in Los Angeles..."}
{"text":"I had the need to feed 40 birthday party goers last weekend. I thought BBQ and then i thought Honey Bears. I gave them a call a week in advance with my menu selections and itinerary. I arranged to pick up the food at the VanBuren location at 3:00 on a Saturday afternoon, I arrived at 3:00 just as they were finishing packaging everything up for the ride. They were timely, the food was hot, the sides were perfect and the price was a value. The people at the party that knew Honey Bears were delighted those that didn't became fans that Saturday. My thanks to Mark and the staff at Honey Bears. They make feeding large groups cost effective and easy."}
{"text":"Dayum that was some awesome bbq chicken! Was visiting from colorado and i dont think i can find anything that competes back home. Sausage sandwich and ribs were quite tasty too. Will remember next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I went here on a Groupon, and my initial thought was \"I'm glad I only paid 50%.\" The ribs were too fatty and in small pieces (like bony riblets). It was heavily sauced, so I have no idea if it was properly smoked. The atmosphere was okay but is far from the best in the Valley. The highlight was their Mac & Cheese. Oh, and RC Cola? Seriously?"}
{"text":"Service was on point.  Place is old but has character.  Meats were tender full of  flavor.  Fries crispy.  Sodas on point right amount of syrup to carbonation. My son loved it.  We  will be back"}
{"text":"I provided Honey Bears with a review I was going to submit, but based on that interaction I modified the review to provide a different slant - constructive ideas for their business.

1. Customer service and satisfaction - when I explained that we did not receive baby back ribs on 1/20/2012 from their Tempe location, I was told that we must be mistaken since they had changed ribs weeks before. I requested a credit for just half a slab of real baby backs as compensation. Having been a regular customer of their chicken sandwiches for over a decade, we were astounded that our request so far has been ignored.
2. The cashiers would benefit from training much like what McDonalds provides its employees. A friendly \"how are you today\" or \"what can we do for you\" would suffice.
3. Change out the dated green tinted TV that people watch while waiting in the line. Sit down customers do have several flat screens to watch.
4. Hire a lighting designer to make the interior more appealing. Lowering light in parts of the restaurant would give it more character and make it more appealing.
5. Get a better cash register. Seems like the cashiers have always complained about this brand of computerized register.

Hopefully this will help. And hopefully Honey Bears has moved to real fall-off-the-bone baby back ribs - ones that we did experience at their Central location, but not at their Tempe location."}
{"text":"This place really needs an overhaul.  It really did not feel clean to me at all. Place was empty, but trash cans were overflowing and dirty.  The tables were not wiped off and there was meat on the floor.

With nothing going on in the place, why weren't the staff cleaning up?

The food was good, but with the way the place looks and feels, I wouldn't go back.

The owner needs to update this place, and soon!"}
{"text":"First & Last time I come here. I assumed that the food & service would be great considering this place has been here for years, but the gentleman taking our order was not polite and had VERY little patience when explaining things even tho I had initially told him that this was my first time here. Our order was placed on a single dish so I questioned if maybe we were still waiting for another one. He said he didn't know if there was a problem with the order because he couldn't see our order. My boyfriend was sitting at our table so the employee couldn't see from behind the counter. He seemed irritated with the fact & then walked around to take a closer look. Finally explaining that the order was put together as one. He said he'd give us a little extra, but never did."}
{"text":"This place is hot. Great BBQ, not so great Peach Cobbler and I wish I would have noticed the  sign for the catfish special before ordering.  The lady at the register is quick, brash and loud. Food is out fast, serve yourself BBQ sauce and grab a seat in the red-walled dining room.  It gets a bit loud in there between the voices and the TVs but the small space is well lit by windows on all three walls, over looking Central Ave. 

Try the catfish, and let me know how it is but skip the peach cobbler."}
{"text":"This place is still as bad as it was when I first reviewed it.  I got suckered into giving it another go because I didn't want to eat alone, and there were literally no redeeming qualities.  

For those reviewers who think reviews like mine are BBQ snobbery, I'd say even when I'm starving and don't give a rip I'd rather have ANY other BBQ in Phoenix than this place."}
{"text":"None of these negative reviews are valid whatsoever. The place is very clean, the staff is amazing, and the food is great. I got the beef brisket sandwich which is good, but these baked beans are AMAZING. I've eaten a lot of BBQ in my day and their beans blow other places out of the water (specifically rudys who claims to be the king of em). 

The owner Mark and his staff are very generous and personal individuals which is another key reason I'll continue to come back."}
{"text":"I've never eaten at this location; both times I've had it was to-go. The first time I had a pulled pork sandwich, and a side of the beans. The pork was extremely dry and tasteless without the sauce. The sauce I found was overly seasoned. And the beans had way too much pepper. 

The second time I had HB's was a work lunch that we had this delivered. Once again, the pork was completely dry, but not as dry as the pulled chicken, which my coworkers complained about. 

I prefer Hap's BBQ over this place for sure."}
{"text":"I just cannot understand why this place is so highly rated. Could it be that people have never experienced barbeque outside of Arizona, so they have no basis of comparison? But even that cannot be true. We have Joe's in Gilbert, and even Famous Dave's is pretty darn good. 

I work a block from this location, so I have been there at least a dozen times. While not great, it is something different once in awhile, so I put in an appearance now and then. The food is not bad, per se, it is just not that good. The prices, on the other hand, are far too high for what you get. $11 gets you a \"large sandwich\" which is not very large, an order of fries, and a soda--RC brands. For a couple of bucks more I could get a combo platter at Famous Daves. 

Service is all business. I don't think I have ever seen a smile in the place. But it is fast. The place is usually dirty, but I am usually there right around lunch, so it might be better other times. 

Just not impressed at all. But...it beats the Burger King down the street which is the worst BK in Christendom. But that is another review."}
{"text":"Good place for when the bbq craving hits."}
{"text":"The guy at the cashier was very chill and friendly. 

We ordered the value meal with 3 pieces of ribs, pulled pork sandwich plus a side of mac  & cheese. The BBQ sauce was goood. The ribs were good too but I just hiked Squaw Peak for the first time when I went there so I was really really exhausted and hungry that I'd pretty much eat anything. So, I'm not sure. It's worth a try though!

By the way, thanks to Yelp we got $2 off! We also ordered peach cobbler and sweet potato pie for dessert, and they were delicious!

Will we visit again? For sure!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ sandwiches in Phoenix.  The BBQ sauce is amazing.  I generally get the chicken sandwiches but my friends all swear by the pork."}
{"text":"In town for business, and anytime I travel for work I try to hit up a bbq joint.  Literally went five minutes before close, and the cashier was nice enough to let me order for dine in.  
I am a hearty eater, so I got the chicken dinner with two sides, and a two meat sandwich.  The meats I chose were pork and beef.  The two sides were French fries, and potato salad.  The pro e wad very reasonable.
Lets start with the chicken.  It was smothered in bbq sauce, but was a nice piece of chicken.  The taste was OK.  I've had much better, also much worse.  It also wasn't that beefy of a chicken, so I was happy I
 ordered the extra sandwich.
The sandwich was a different story. I would give the bbq meat a 8/10. It had a very smokey taste, like it just came off a big pile of wood.  I thoughly enjoyed that meat, the plain white bun it was on, not so much.  
The fries were very basic, and the potato salad was also nothing to write home about. 
If I am back in town, I would probably come back.  But, again a very sub-par bbq experience."}
{"text":"One of the best BBQ beef sandwiches I've ever had. No fuss barbecue and quite the experience. Oh, and the cowboy beans are amazing too."}
{"text":"Used to live in the neighborhood here and frequent Honey Bear's quite often. My favorite night to go is Friday, when you can get a big bucket of delicious rib tips for very little scratch. The sauce is amazing, and has just the right amount of vinegar, I'm salavating just thinking about it. It's definitely a dive, and you will always see a bum inside, and the bathrooms are ridiculously disgusting. The staff is rude, and not very helpful, and even a couple of times a 10 year old took my order. All of it is made up for by the great food. The ribs, tips, sandwiches, and brisket are all awesome and well executed. I just don't want to know what their health report looks like."}
{"text":"I went to this place after reading the reviews on Yelp, but I was very disappointed.  I ordered some pulled port and sausage with some various sides.  The sausage tasted like a hotdog!!! I took it back to the counter thinking they accidentally gave me a hotdog happy meal or something...
 
The pulled pork was average and the collard greens were good, but for 20.28 for one meal, that's just wrong.  Maybe I'm being too critical, but I threw away a little more than half of the food I was served... I've lived in Texas and Georgia and know what good BBQ tastes like, but I wouldn't recommend this at all."}
{"text":"Not to shabby.  Went on a Saturday night.  They had a half rack rib special with 2 sides for 12.99.  This was totally worth it.  I ate every bite.  Ribs fell off the bone.  The sauce is where it's at.  Nuff said."}
{"text":"This place barely earned a one star! 
Went here on a groupon recently, it'd been years since we ate here.  I Remember it being pretty good then. 
Let me sum it up: we ordered the 9.95 (sandwich, side & drink combo) the beef was burnt dry, the sauce reminded of a grade up from Arby sauce & the fries tasted stale. I Thought I was being  negative but my husband who's not too picky complained more than me. To top it off, we were charged extra for a side we didn't order when we presented this to the cashier she swore we ordered it, we didn't! She finally gave us 1/2 a refund saying we didn't get tax back because of groupon..... huh???? Our original order came to 18.00 the groupon was for 20. 
Whatever!   We're never going back!!"}
{"text":"Great barbecue! Had pulled pork sandwich, ribs, mac & cheese, sweet potato tater tots and sweet potato pie. Everything was great! First time here and we'll be back! The sauce was sweet and tangy with a bite to it. Very tasty!!"}
{"text":"Honey Bear's is the some of the best BBQ you can find in the Valley. I enjoy getting a half chicken half pork sandwich, but you can't go wrong with any selection. Limited menu but thats because they stick to wait there good at, BBQ sandwiches."}
{"text":"My boyfriend decided to stop in a few weeks ago and order some food to go. He ordered a ribs and chicken combo, a hot-link sausage sandwich, and some side items (collard greens, bbq beans, and buns). I believe he paid about $30 for the food and the commute home was very short. 

The best part of the entire meal was the collard greens and they were not even that good. The meat was flavorless and tough. We decided to save some of the meat as leftovers and ended up throwing it away a few days later. It was a first and a last time visit for my boyfriend. I had previously tried french fries on my own trip and also wings on another prior and they were so tasteless that I forgot to even write a review until now."}
{"text":"Love honey bear. It is my favorite bbq  joint, but came In  tonight to get dinner no french fries no coleslaw and meat was cold. This is the second time that they didn't have side and food was mediocre."}
{"text":"Service: I asked the clerk what would be a good meal for a family of four. He gave his recommendation and I went with it. Got the meal home and we only have 1 mac and cheese, 1 potato salad 5 rolls. Now, this wasn't some big Styrofoam container. It was just enough for one person. The clerk seemed like it was a pain for him to answer some questions about the food that is keeping him employed. 

Food: It was ok. Not great, just okay. There wasn't anything that screamed \"Have seconds!\" The sauce is decent. Nothing spectacular. 

Overall, it was a 2 because nothing blew me away. I just made some ribs tonight on the grill and I thought they were better than Honey's. 
If you're craving bbq, then this will get you out of a pinch. But if you want the \"Slap yo momma\" type grub, then make an about face."}
{"text":"Honey Bears is a place I'd heard fantastic things about for quite some time and so when I finally made it over there one weeknight with some friends and office-mates, I was surprised to find it so incredibly lackluster. 

More than that, it was simply not good. I'm not sure if the food was just old and done for the day, as we were there about an hour before closing time, or what, but the meat was basically sprayed with some sauce and they called it a day. The meat was devoid of flavor and overcooked. I had chicken but the ribs were absolutely nothing to sneeze at either. The corn on the cob was simply some frozen piece nuked up or boiled or what-have-you, with some chips thrown in for good measure and that was about it.

The insides aren't impressive in the slightest, either. I've been to plenty of dive places and had a great dining experience and considered it more the fun for it (Lolo's original location in Phoenix comes to mind, as it has a certain fun and well-managed charm inside) but this was dark, dingy, and unpleasant.

The sauce was perhaps a saving grace if the food wasn't served nearly lukewarm and was able to bring something to the table on its own. Sadly, no amount of sauce-drowning could save my meal. I left unhappy and unfulfilled. I've heard so many great things from people I trust, so I may have to try it once more, during the day, but for now, the one star stands, as there was simply nothing even a little redeeming about this food."}
{"text":"I had pretty high expectations for honey bears and they definitely followed through! YUMMY! We got the chicken and ribs combo and you really don't need teeth to eat it!..... totally melt off the bone, tender, yummy goodness.  

Usually my friend and I talk each others ears off when we are out and tend to ignore food/drinks... I am pretty sure we were completely silent devouring our food until we were licking our fingers clean! 

They do have specials each day of the week. Tuesday was 2-4-1 beers :)  This is a no frills kind of place. Just order, wait for it at the counter, grab a seat and enjoy.  Its kind of great though... you know exactly what you're getting... no need for 'atmosphere' or attentive customer service because the food speaks for itself.  

My only gripe was that they don't have cornbread, which is disappointing at a BBQ place. Instead dinner comes with disappointing white bread rolls.

I wouldn't call the location particularly sketchy.  There is a big parking lot and its right on Central Ave near lots of nicer places too."}
{"text":"Come on guys.  You can do better than this.  The Van Buren location does.

We showed up around 6:30pm with Groupon in hand.

The place was dirty, the BBQ cauldron was nearly empty, and the cashier/waiter brought us spare ribs when we ordered baby backs... he brought us spare ribs twice... after I had to ask twice to get the baby backs we ordered.  Seriously???  We just left."}
{"text":"Shared the brisket sandwich and rib combo with my fiance this evening. One side is included and then we added on another (mac n' cheese and coleslaw).

Portions are HUGE! Great bang for the buck. The ribs were juicy and sauce-y, brisket sandwich was flavorful and had awesome smokey notes to it.The coleslaw is similar to that of KFC's which in my book, is AH-MAZING. Standard back mac n' cheese, not too runny.

You'd never come here for ambience but the place is clean and there are a few TV's around. 

My fiance has had lots and lots of BBQ and gave this place his stamp of approval, so we will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Honestly I am shocked to read some of the more tepid reviews on here -- no offense, but I wonder if they ate at the same place we did?  This place was excellent. 

My husband and I both think we are individual experts at BBQ.  He travels all over the country and tries the ribs everyplace he visits -- whoopee.  Meanwhile, I grew up in Memphis, attending the Memphis in May cook off every year and visiting award winning BBQ joints the other eleven months.  Whichever one of us is right about their superior knowledge of BBQ (clearly I am) we both LOVED the food here.

This is without doubt, as close as I've come since I left Tennessee.  The pulled pork is smoky and so tender it melts. The Cole slaw was on point -- and pulled pork ain't Memphis style without coleslaw right on the sandwich.  The sauce is sweet and tangy and fantastic.  

The ribs were smokey and tender.  They were so good without sauce that it was a personal struggle deciding to dip or not dip each bite of rib meat.

Don't go in expecting a fancy dining room and table clothes with this five star experience.  However, if you're looking for really authentic BBQ, this place is the bomb."}
{"text":"Went in with a Goupon and ordered a rack of ribs \"to go\".  The place wasn't very busy, but the manager had to step in to facilitate the food preparation.  In took a while to get my order.  When I got home (10 minutes) the spare ribs were cool, dry and chewy with limited/no flavor.  They apparently got them out of wherever they store them, heat'em up and pour on some sauce.  I can cook ribs better at home, and so can the majority of Americans.

I've experienced better, I've made better, and I don't plan on going back."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for dinner when I was in the area on a seminar over the weekend. The food was respectable. It wasn't mind blowing or anything. I do dig their sauce though.

I think most of my issues are with the location itself. I felt like it was kind of fake divey. While it isn't fancy at all (was previously an IHOP), it just doesn't have any real character. I love a good dive as long as it feels authentic. This just felt like someone wasn't trying to hard when they were converting it.

I've had most of my Honey Bear's BBQ at picnics & other places where people have brought it in catered. I think I've enjoyed it more then than my visit to the downtown location.  Sorry..."}
{"text":"I've used them for parties (where I picked up large trays of food) and I've eaten lunch there often and never been disappointed.  I especially like the fried catfish (not served every day, so inquire.)  The staff is always friendly and the food always hot and good.  And, this location has french fries which I do like.  All in all, a great place for a good, quick meal in cenpho."}
{"text":"First timer! My favorite was the Bbq sauce! The sliders were good tasting. The service was okay and was a bit worried after ordering, I noticed the restroom was disgusting! I hope the kitchen doesn't look like their restrooms. I would probably go back but not often."}
{"text":"Tennessee BBQ done right, complete with a smoky and spicy bbq sauce. As much sauce as you want! I've been a loyal Honey Bears fan over the years, every time I'm in Phoenix, I'll end up here!

Get the pulled pork sandwich with beans and lots of sauce. Get the mac and cheese too. Put sauce on it. Use the yelp coupon, get your grub on."}
{"text":"This is really one of the more disappointing BBQ places in Phx.  I hate to disrespect Honey Bears but their pulled pork is just too dry.  I shouldn't have to cover it in your bbq sauce (which isn't THAT good either) in order to make it edible.  Also, if you are going to churn out dry pork, you have got a lot of nerve charging for more bbq sauce.  I've never had anything else here but the fact that the pork isn't all that good is all I need to know.  I'll stick with Stacey's down the road."}
{"text":"The food is very dry and the place is super dirty. Would not recommend. Never been to the one on Central Ave so cant speak to that one."}
{"text":"Oh I don't know what the big deal is. OMG!...people scream at me...you HAVE to eat at Honey Bears. It is soooo good. So I go. Hmmm...WTF. I order a pork sandwich, side o slaw and side o potato salad. Sandwich came with all the s.o.s. which on one hand is good cuz otherwise the bun would fall apart like my Aunt Helen did when I told her I was a homo. But the meat suffers from not \"marinating\" in said sauce. Slaw was passable but the potato salad had that weird store bought, vinegary, mustardy, icky poo cocka flavor. Ya'll know what I mean! I guess I'll just have to wait til I hang with the inlaws in San Antonio cuz then we always go to Bill Miller BBQ and sistahs let me tell you Mr. Miller knows BBQ!"}
{"text":"I've been to the renowned \"Memphis in May BBQ Festival,\" but Honey Bear's pulled pork and BBQ sauce is as good as any I've ever tasted. 

Since the owners of this place come from TN, I guess that shouldn't come as a surprise. The pulled pork sandwich is out of this world. Honey Bear's motto is, \"you don't need no teeth to eat our meat.\" And that's really true. It's slow-cooked, moist, and packed with flavor. The BBQ sauce is amazing. It's tangy and spicy, I'm thinking it might have a tomato and vinegar base, but I don't really know. My husband loves their hot links and spicy sausage. He's a rib guy too and says they're great. 

Honey Bear's on Van Buren is a bit of a dive and it's located in a slightly dicey, but safe, location. I think the dumpy atmosphere adds to the down home feel of the place."}
{"text":"It's been a while Honey Bear's. I apologize. I've been a little obsessed with Little Miss BBQ as of late. I remember when you were the Little Miss BBQ in town. Trekking down to Van Buren was the same adventure that being surrounded by barbed wire at Little Miss is today. This was my first ever visit to your Central Avenue location. The BBQ was as good as I remember. We ordered your pulled pork and your chicken. Both were great. We also enjoyed having our pups with us on your front patio. Thank you.

So what's the deal with all the mediocre Yelp reviews? Is it Yelp herd behavior, not wanting to give a great review unless others feel the same? Has there been an actual deterioration in quality and service? Are people really not getting the idea that BBQ sauces vary regionally? Is it a problem that Honey Bear's Mac and Cheese was developed before White Truffle Mac and Cheese became a foodie staple? Can't tell you. Our experience was great. Perhaps the herd instinct even had an impact on me, however, as I settled on a four star rating after considering five.

Yes, there is only one BBQ sauce. Yes, the décor is basic. Yes, the counter staff is not overly loquacious. Yes, the outdoor seating is right next to Central Avenue.  I'm just not sure how much any of this matters if you're looking for a BBQ joint. My taste buds still steer me toward Little Miss, but Honey Bear's is a very solid alternative. And one without an hour long wait! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great pulled pork sandwiches and it's a quick 5 min. drive from my house.  If you like BBQ this is one of the better places here in AZ.  I don't think their sides are really that good more just there to have something on the side other than the sandwich.  Anyways as I said great for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Oh sure, I may cook again someday...when it's not 110!  However, thank goodness for Honey Bear's tonight!  I got a pulled pork and a chicken bbq sandwich.  The 7 year old chose the chicken so I got the pork.  While I usually prefer the pork, my daughter and I sampled each other's sandwiches and, wow, that chicken was delicious!  The cole slaw had a spice in it that she didn't like (celery salt?) but she loved the mac and cheese.   I did like the cole slaw though.  Weird side note - I had mango for desert a bit later and it rounded out the spicy sauce and heavy pork meal really well.  Maybe I'll try mango with the meal next time...."}
{"text":"Ok, so I haven't actually been to this location. I just had the BBQ from their tent at the Tempe Art Festival. When I got there the BBQ rib tips weren't ready yet. Mark Smith actually delivered them a couple blocks away to my office when they were ready, and he included extras. Such wonderful service, so nice! The BBQ sauce was amazing and I want to head to one of the full-menu locations to try their ribs. mmm"}
{"text":"Now I hold all my BBQ reviews up to my favorite standard and that is Rudy's (a TX based chain with stores in ABQ).  Now I have only been here (Honey Bear's) once on a suggestion from a friend who said it was as good as Rudy's.  Well now I can't say that just yet.   
I stopped in on a whim for lunch.  I decided on the pulled pork sandwich and a side of mac n cheese.  I added a few jalapenos, but I could have used some fresh onions (I guess I should have asked).   
The mac n cheese was good and creamy (velveta like in texture)  and the bbq sauce thin but very tasty (not to sweet, not too ketsupy or vinegary and a nice kick).  The sandwich was that type that required some fork and knife work, especially if you are like me and add more sauce.   
As for the restaurant itself, when I was there it was clean, no frills cafe style.  You go up to the counter to order and pick-up and find a spot to sit.  I enjoyed my meal and plan on going back to try more items off the menu."}
{"text":"[3 stars by my relatively National BBQ standards, 4 by PHX Standards] .  

House hunting works up an appetite.  My realtor and I were looking for a quick bite to eat and stopped in here.  Nothing fancy we just ordered up 2 small/regular pulled pork sandwiches and 2 drinks.  It hit the spot .  Yeah  and as usual I should have brought a bib.  Juicy, smokey pulled pork with a sauce that is a good balance of sweet, spicy and tangy.   I could have used a few pickled jalapeno slices or some fresh onion but that is my personal preference.  
When going for my drink I saw it....my favorite BBQ beverage Big Red.  Yum!  
I left content and not over stuffed. Feeling the need for BBQ I am sure I will stop in at this location again."}
{"text":"My buddy has been raving about this place for months. We were in the area and decided to finally try it out. I had huge expectations!! I was so stoked to find a good BBQ restaurant in the central area. 

This place is garbage. Paid $7.05 for a 0.90 cent size cheeseburger from McDonalds. There was hardly anything to the sandwich, could compare it to the amount of meat on an Arby's jr. I tried a pulled pork sandwich. The meat was lacking the true smoked BBQ flavor that I'd assume it's supposed to have. The meat was bland, tasteless. The bread was a cheap bun that you can get a 6 pack for $1 at the grocery store. I'm not a big guy and the sandwich was gone in 5 bites. Not filling at all. 

The inside is old, bathrooms look like they haven't been cleaned in months, dining area seems clean but needs to be updated. Tacky tables with bus stop ads in them.

Tiny, tiny sandwich. Bland food. BBQ sauce is nothing to write home about. I'm extremely disappointed that I wasted my money here. Not a fan."}
{"text":"I tried the Brisket sandwich with beans as a side for the combo I purchased. The counter service was fast. I thought the sandwich was good and better than I had been led to believe by some co workers who live here. The beans were good too with a very tomato based flavor. 

I would come back."}
{"text":"I'm an Arizona native, but I lived in Memphis for a few years and developed a taste for Tennessee-style pulled pork. Honey Bear's is as close as you'll get, plus their sauce has a little southwestern kick due to all the chili flakes. Make sure to get the sweet potato pie!"}
{"text":"I love Honey Bear's!  I've been visiting their restaurants for years.  I've been to the one on Van Buran, the one on Central and this one in Tempe.  They have the runniest sauce on earth but dang it tastes great!  I love the pulled pork sandwiches but not the long lines at lunch.  When I went after 1pm in the afternoon I stood in a line of one - me."}
{"text":"The cut of rib meat used is cheap. Doesn't compare to the quality of baby backs or St. Louis ribs. Didn't seem to be smoked that long. The hot links are cheap too. I also ordered 1 lb or sliced beef. Didn't check my order before leaving. I got 1 lb of shredded beef in a styrofoam cup. I'd never ever go back again."}
{"text":"I recently ate some BBQ ribs and coleslaw, only to find out it came from Honey Bear's. I'm not sure if they changed recipes or cooks, but it certainly tasted better than it did in the past. There was more meat on the bone and the sauce wasn't overwhelming."}
{"text":"delicious, I was in the mood from some BBQ and didn't want to go anywhere else, honey BBQ has their craft BBQ sauce in the front in a hot pot, which is super yummy our fresh cut fries"}
{"text":"The lady at the register mean... The wait was like they left to a different restaraunt to get out food..."}
{"text":"Staying in town for some baseball. Was told to eat here....great customer service.  Prices are great.  The BBQ sauce is beyond amazing.  Tried the sliders...one beef,  one pork and one chicken.  One word...WOW. best pork I have ever had.  I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Please update your hours. Went in today and the hours said 10am - 8pm. Got there at 6:45 pm and no one was there. Miss this place."}
{"text":"The place here is a dump.  I wouldn't mind so much if the food was good but I wasn't a fan of the food.  The sauce is very \"sour/bitter/tangy.\"  I like more hot/spicy.  If you like tangy sauce then give this place a shot.  I also got very sick after I ate here which is why I'm knocking it down to one star.  Services and prices aren't anything to write home about either.  This place either needs a complete re-haul or they need to hang it up."}
{"text":"We really liked this place. Tried them on a Groupon and will definitely be back when we come in town. The outside of the place looked a bit scary, but don't let that fool you. It was excellent food! We had the ribs, wonderful, fall of the bone delish! The chicken was just as juicy! The pulled BBQ beef was good too. Potato salad was great too! This is definitely in the top 5 BBQ places we've ever eaten at. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Had a pulled pork sandwich and fries ... Couldn't have been better. I will go back for the ribs another time."}
{"text":"Just fed my whole team some of the best bbq in town, this is what they were dying to have. Damn love those hot links and beans."}
{"text":"I gave it a 3 start only because it's super HOT in this building! It's like A/C doesn't exist! I love honey bears but I won't be dining in and I know now to call in my order!"}
{"text":"I'm glad I had a Deal Chicken deal because the food was just ehhh. 

With my credit of $24 and a few extra dollars, I ordered a full rack of pork ribs which included two sides (I chose collared greens & sweet potato fries-- small upcharge that I was not informed of), 1/2lb of hot links and a few free dinner buns. 

The ribs were fairly good (3 stars) albeit a bit dry-- I guess that's why they drown it in BBQ sauce. The hot links however were dissssgusting. (0 stars). Just thinking about it makes me want to puke. It was so soft, I quickly tossed out the serving that was on my plate and what was left in the container. They are what I imagine vienna sausages would taste like (but spicy, of course). 

Collared greens & sweet potato fries were edible.. not cringeworthy (like the hot links), but not worth the calories/stomach space either. 

Service was friendly & efficient. 

Warning: be prepared to swat flies if you dine in. There were several on the day I was in... ick!"}
{"text":"I would much rather have tried the Downtown location, but, lo, I was dating a guy from Gilbert.  That lasted 2 weeks.  The date, not the food.
Good enough, I guess.  I had some sandwich but it wasn't very memorable.  It came out pretty quickly, even though it was 5 minutes to closing time.  I'm guessing it was microwaved.
I'll definitely go back, just not to this location."}
{"text":"This was the most disgusting BBQ I've ever had in my life! I give it 0 stars. The meat tasted spoiled, the side orders were cold, the tea tasted 4 days old and the customer service was awful just like the food. I would never recommend this place not even to my worst enemy. On top of that the staff were rude and dismissive. I ended up with food poisoning therefore I am very disappointed in the food and the service."}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago and dying for some fantastic tasting ribs, other than those that I BBQ myself. Everyone pointed me to Honey Bear's BBQ.

The place is clean and casual, and the service is OK. But the ribs were horrible. The beer was fantastic though and I first thought maybe the alcohol had dulled my taste buds. I remember screaming, \"Either this is a poor cut of beef/pork or both animals had mad cow/pig disease!\"

I decided to return and give them another chance, and not order alcohol. I ordered the ribs and again, \"Mad Cow Disease!\"

I won't ever return. How does that go: \"First time shame on you, second time shame on me...\""}
{"text":"The ribs are well above average but their pulled pork sandwich is out of this world! 

I've had BBQ from places all over the U.S. and this little place really stands out in my mind. :)

The reason I didn't give it five stars is for the location. It's not in a nice area but the staff is friendly and you can get your food to go."}
{"text":"This seems to be a more \"authentic\" location than some of the Honey Bear's I've been to, but it did not add much to the experience. The aisle that feeds you to the counter is winding, obtrusive and unnecessary. I ordered the large BBQ Beef sandwich, potato salad and a large RC cola to go. After a bit, the guy working the counter called my number and handed me a tray. I politely asked him to make it to go, and got a bit of attitude. Once I got back to the pad, the food was soggy and hard to eat, but that was kinda a good thing. It was actually refreshing to have an RC, it seems like you have to go with either Pepsi or Coke all the time. I would go back. There is something about the sauce that will bring me back in eventually. Not the kind of place I think I'd frequent, but good in a pinch."}
{"text":"Chile, please. You call that Barbeque??? (SNORT)  And they definitely AINT soul food. They are in a misplaced category. Take it from a soul sista with a southern mama, unh uh...

It was probably back  in 2001  the first and only time I ate there. I couldn't even finish my bbq pork sandwich, I was that disappointed.

For those who hail from states to the East of  Arizona, you'll know just what I mean. Sorry, Honey Bears. Just keeping it real!"}
{"text":"Their sandwiches are excellent! I like to get the slider trio with bbq chicken, brisket, and pulled pork. Their potato salad is pretty decent but not as good as grandma's ;). Also, their coleslaw is quite nice but just a touch of too much mayo. Now comes the bad part: the ribs. I absolutely love bbq ribs and unfortunately their's were dry with very little meat on the bone. I would not recommend the ribs here to anyone. Stick with the sammy's and you'll be all good."}
{"text":"Lesson learned: Don't ignore your instincts, and don't walk into a store whose signage is only 1/4 lit up on a Saturday night!

Why, Oh why did I drag myself out of the car when I saw the telltale signs of a disastrous meal ahead! The person at the counter is obviously not interested in his job...he never made eye contact, never greeted us, and later we saw him hanging out with his pals inside the store. He seemed to have too much time on his hands...on a Saturday night! 

We ordered a full plate of ribs and sides of potato salad and mac and cheese. The best thing I liked about the meal was the salad, which should definitely not be the case for a BBQ restaurant!

The table tops were greasy, the food was served on styrofoam plates, and there were two huge open trash containers parked inside the restaurant! One was right near the condiments counter, and I was thoroughly disgusted! Honey B, can you at least put a lid on your trash?

The food, well, the less said the better. Microwaved ribs, chewy and tough, slathered with nothing-amazing BBQ sauce. Blah! Oh and my 7-up...I don't know what liquid they were serving under the guise of 7-Up. It was some watered-down flavored thing. Disgusting!

The whole place had an atmosphere of neglect and abandon. So much so that my friend even asked the guy at the counter if they were closing down! Oh Honeyyyy!"}
{"text":"We've been here before and the food and service were very good. Today however was a very different story! The young guy taking our order seemed completely confused. We ordered 2 kid meals and 4 adult meals and he only charged us $13.95. When we tried to argue and pay the right amount he smiled and just acted like he didn't know what we were talking about. I hope to god that the owner wises up and fires this idiot. He's gotta be losing tons of money from this fool! On top of the idiotic service, the ribs were fatty and chewy, the collard greens never saw a ham bone and the corn on the cob tasted like last weeks reheated mess. Definitely don't recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Got a to-go order of the #2 sliders meal with Mac & cheese and the #3 small sandwich and 2 ribs. See my attached picture. Not impressed with the packaging. They forgot our small sandwich, provided no utensils, no napkins. I wanted to try them out because of the good comments made by a friend, but I have yet to experience the hype. The shredded meat on the sandwiches was dry, glad I ordered a side of bbq. The BBQ is strictly what got them 3 stars. I think I'll just order a bottle and skip the restaurant."}
{"text":"Went there with my girlfriend for what I thought would be good bbq. She ordered the half chicken and I got a pulled pork sandwich.  Not only did her chicken come out pink and bleeding once but it happened twice. When I told them the first time the cashier said, \"we usually have good food.\" So it's okay to serve bad food too? He asked how the chicken was when he was bringing in the chairs from outside and we said the same,  still pink and bleeding. All he said was oh okay and walked away. I didn't even eat my sandwich because if they couldn't cook chicken right why should I trust them to cook the pork correctly? When I went to the front to talk with them they all disappeared.  Never would I think about going back and spend my money there again."}
{"text":"Deliciousness! Love the food!"}
{"text":"I was carving BBQ today and decided to go to Honey Bears. I hadn't been to Honey Bears in years, and this location in forever. Something has changed, apart from the looks, which now look old, unkempt, and run down, the food was...no bueno! I ordered a pulled pork sandwich combo and a hot link on the side. I paid almost 14 bucks. My combo came with the sandwich, a side, and a drink. The hot link was an extra $1.99. Now, I don't mind paying 14 bucks if the food is amazing, this was not the case. My sandwich had plenty of meat but it was just blah, nothing amazing, the bun was some generic bun that was super soggy from the meat. No, if my sandwich was made when I ordered it and I ate at the restaurant there is no reason my bun should be that soggy that fast. Right? Fine, I removed most of the bottom bun and spread the remaining meat on the top bun and ate that. The mac and cheese, oh man, the mac and cheese. It was lukewarm, it was not cheesy, or creamy, or anything. I took 2 small bites and asked to switched it out either for a hot mac and cheese or something else. The girl at the counter stood there for a bit, then went and asked the Spanish speaking lady in the kitchen if the mac and cheese was turned on since \"the lady at the counter is saying it's not hot\". She came back and asked me if I wanted something else other than the mac and cheese, I chose potato salad.....
UGH, I went from bad to worse. This potato salad had a lot going on and all the ingredients over powered each other. I took only one bite of that and was done. I finished my sandwich and my hot link and got out of there. I'm not saying I won't have Honey Bears again, but I will definitely not be coming to this location. I'm hoping the location in central Phoenix has been better kept - restaurant and food. 
PS don't go off most of the pictures posted on this page, and if you do, please check out the dates. they are as old as 2010 - and back then, this place was better. Not sure if personnel changed, owners, cooks, or what but it is not the same."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite barbecue ever.  Such great memories are tied to honey bears.  We've eaten in, had carry out and have had them cater.  Their meat is always tender, the beans are just awesome , the sauce is amazing.  It's all just super damn good.  It's low key to eat in and they are always kind. Bring your appetite. I suggest the chicken or the pork sandwich."}
{"text":"For over $11 you expect something more than a soggy grocery store bun. The pulled pork sandwich is really small compared to most places. The cheap bun doesn't support the sauce. Overpriced lunch combo for sure."}
{"text":"eating at honey bears is like having an average-looking girlfriend. you're thankful for all the good times you've had, but you have this suspicion that if you looked around you'd find something better. pulled pork sandwich is decent, but the bun is soggy. ribs are tasty but stringy. the \"hot link\" sandwich tastes like a sliced up hot dog. best things there are the fries and the BBQ sauce, which actually go quite well together. make sure you check your take out order before you leave, they've been known to get things wrong."}
{"text":"We really wanted to like Honey Bears. As far as BBQ goes, this was a perfectly average meal. My side salad was ok, corn was very good, pulled chicken was very dry and the roll it was on (got sliders) was store bought. No amount of sauce made the chicken juicier. Unfortunately the sauce had no character-was just sauce. While we are on that, flies were all around the sauce. My husbands ribs were ok but not very meaty. We are hitting all the BBQ joints in the area as we just moved here. We won't be going back here unfortunately."}
{"text":"ribs were dry, hardly any meat on them, and chewy/tough. seems that management may have changed since I last visited many years ago. man at counter lacked appreciation for my business, made crude comments about women who had just left,  and was very impersonal, did not thank me for my business or even look at me when he handed my to go order to me. I doubt I'll ever return to this location. the one on central I may try once more."}
{"text":"Favorite BBQ ever! Absolutely love the sauce, I'd bathe in it if I could.

Get the pork ribs with a side of fries and mac m cheese. Just be sure to eat the fries while they're hot."}
{"text":"I was browsing new reviews on Yelp, as I am wont to do, when I saw a 5-star review for this place. That reminded me that I had once tried the terrible food here about a year ago but I did not bother to write a review about it. The review I read was for a different location so it is possible some of the others are better, but the one in Tempe is a definite \"NO\". 

I got a pulled pork sandwich and the bread was so soggy that it was inedible. Not soggy in a good way from saucy goodness but like the meat and been kept hot in boiling water and they took it out and just plopped it on the bun and then squirted some bbq sauce on top. My husband had ribs which tasted like they had been cooked several hours ago and then reheated in a microwave. 

I don't remember much else about the food but I do remember that the restaurant was so dirty and unwelcoming that we got our food to-go even though we were originally planning to eat there. It was just a bad vibe. 

I know there are not a lot of options for good bbq in phx but I heartily recommend staying away from this place. On a related note: If anyone can tell me of a place in the valley that serves Texas style barbecue then please, please contact me. My husband is actually pressuring me to move back to Houston because he can't find a place here that serves beef ribs."}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews but after what happened to me , I feel I have to warn others about this restaurant. I emailed the owners and got no response or acknowledgment whatsoever. 

There's a reason why this place has 3 stars. If I could give it 0 stars I would. 

I work very close by and this has been one of my favorite places to eat during my lunch.
I ordered 2 pork sandwiches a drink and fries.  When my co -worker and I opened our bbq pork sandwiches , it had a very odd smell. Pork goes bad pretty quickly if not stored correctly.  This has never been the case before, so I went up to the cashier (Bruce) and told him the sandwiches did not smell okay. I asked if maybe he could smell them and let me know what he thought.  He was very rude and said \"he was not going to\" ...said if I wanted something else or my money back. He never apologized , or even attempted to figure out by going to the kitchen to find out if the rest of the meat had gone bad.
Since he did not want to help or care that I told him something was off with the meat, I asked for my money back.
 
He made me wait there, until he had helped every last person that kept coming through the door.
 
I wanted to let you know this, because if someone complains about food that has gone bad, the least an employee should do is try to determine whether or not this is true. Many people can get very ill, by eating spoiled pork.
 
This isn't my first time coming here for me or my co-workers and , the meat has never smelled spoiled before.
 
I was very disappointed in the way I was treated by your employee , in front of others and I am reaching out to you so this doesn't happen again to another one of your loyal customers."}
{"text":"The BBQ was really good.  My wife had the pulled pork sandwich and I had the brisket sandwich.  Both were great.  BUT THESE FOLKS DO NOT ALLOW CCW, I WON'T BE BACK."}
{"text":"Great BBQ and sides.  The beans are fantastic, with bits of hot links/sausage. 

Kinda pricey, but most BBQ places are, and this one is worth it.

Their catering is great too.  My office has ordered from Honey Bears several times over the years, and it's consistently good."}
{"text":"Five dollars and thirty cents for a pulled pork sandwich with a side of sauce? Sorry, Honey Bear's, but I'm not feeling you. Why, oh why, did I go on a day when they didn't serve catfish, which I love from here. Perhaps when I blow off some steam over a sandwich this small with no side dishes costing over $5 I'll return for your fish fry. Until then, see ya."}
{"text":"A valley staple. I am not the biggest BBQ or smoked meat fan but the food is good and the portions are huge. If you like BBQ and Soul food check it out. Their Sweet Potato Pie (and surprisingly potato salad) is extremely delish!"}
{"text":"This place is an awesome bbq place.  The sauces are great and the ribs are delicious.  All the side dishes are a winner.  This is always a must go to place every time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I'm feeling extra nice today, so Honey Bears gets 3 stars instead of 2.  We were really hungry after work and couldn't decide on a place, but since we drive down Central and see this place everyday, we figured now was as good a time as ever to give it a shot.  My first sight upon entering was a couple hookers sittin and eatin bbq.  I wasn't sure if that was a good sign or a bad sign, but they were definitely hookers.  Anyway, I stared up at the menu for about 30 seconds (it's pretty small) and decided on a regular bbq beef sandwich and a side of cole slaw.  For two sandwiches and two sides the total came to about 14 bucks.  Not bad!  They also have RC cola in their soda fountain, so that may tickle your fancy.  Not mine.  The food came out in a matter of 2 minutes and we unwrapped our foil covered sandwiches to find... not enough bbq sauce.  They charge extra.  LAME!  The meat was fine, but a little too dry for my taste.  It was pretty good when it had some of the sauce on it.  The cole slaw was okay, better than most places, except it was over peppered to me, but definitely still tasty.  I probably won't go back here, as nothing really stood out to me, but it was good enough for a 20 minute meal."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place and Haps for my bbq fixes for years. Since Haps moved to a building near Honeybears the flavors of their food have seem to drop to bland but Honeybears pork drowned with bbq sauce is really hard to beat. I have been to both the Central location and this one and even though people may say it is a dive they are fast and the food is always great. Their slider special is a good way to test the waters but make sure you drown it in sauce for extra goodness. The central location does fries and the Van Buren one does chips so a win for Central on that one.  Both have the tasty \"Cowbro\" beans which are quite good. The Central local also has vanilla pudding that is quite good but both may have and I never noticed. The downside to the central location is that they do get alot of business from all the offices near by so 12 noon there is a line. Last time I went I seen they were now selling their BBQ sauce so I grabbed a bottle of that also but have yet to try it.

I would recommend this place if you plan on a tasty quick meal with quick service."}
{"text":"Arrived about 1800 for dinner and they were out of brisket. Got the pulled pork sandwich instead and it was the longest wait ever for something that is pretty much already made. Really slow and it did not seem to be because they were busy. There were very few patrons. As I waited I could overhear others asking for the brisket and being told the sad news. The bad part was the employee watched them stare at the menu for many minutes without giving them the heads-up that they were out of brisket so back to the menu they went. Pork was okay but not worth going back for. Seems like a place that is a bit past it's heyday."}
{"text":"got three mini burgers (one beef, one pork, one chicken) for $5. the meat's unfortunately dry, but the buns are good and the spicy barbecue sauce has a good kick."}
{"text":"i've gotten lunch here a few times and it's pretty much Meh,. yea the bbq is pretty good. most are. there are really good sauces, and there are some that are so vile that i would make any body vomit.
Honey Bear's sauce is in the middle it's good, but not great. the meats are pretty good. but nothing to write home about, or anything that will win national awards on teh  BBQ meats circuit. if you forced to eat in a 1 mile drive from work, this place will do fine. if your coming from far away...just stay away."}
