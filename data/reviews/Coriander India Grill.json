{"text":"Are you kidding me!!!?????3.5/5 for this place!!??? This is coming from an Indian, and a foodie. I have had the good fortune of experiencing delicacies of different Indian cusines ranging from street/cart food to upscale 5 stars. I know what I am talking about. This place sucks. The food, the service and the ambience. It was a buffet on a weekend. I was given the crappiest of the place to sit although the restaurant was all empty, well I moved to a different place, no big deal. To start with the appetizers, Tandoori chicken was soo bad, it was awfully greasy, bland and tasteless. The pakoda was disgusting. Okay, no big deal, may be the chef had a bad day. Then the main course, chicken still felt uncooked, the curries were so much so like expiered ready to cook recipies, the nan was tougher, thicker and more plastic than my flip flops, oh boy! I was soo disappointed already. Dessert was the only better part of the whole experience, it was really good actually. Well thats about food. The service: this waiter had no welcoming attitude, no smile no nothing. He comes to my table to clear the food, and takes my plate in his hand clears all the scrap from the plate right beside the table into his cleaning basket with his knee on my opposite chair. I was like, wtf!?? I felt disgusted. You dont have to be a huge hotelier to understand such fundemental aspects of a waiting job. At one point I was working as a waiter and I never would do that. Now the ambience: they basically play crappy, cheesy indian dance and sing routines from the 70's and 80's and that too in full volme. I dont expect them to get all classy and play dire straits or eric clapton, but i could use some soothing bollywood music. I am never going back there. I reccommend/ suggest/forbid people from even thinking about going to this place. Save your weekend, Instead try other Indian restaurants like tamarind in oakland(the best i had so far) or India palace in downtown or even the indian restaurant on atwood street."}
{"text":"This place is HORRIBLE..! The waiters have no idea about what is cooked in their kitchen. I was forced to eat food that I did not order because the waiter thought that that was what I had ordered. He even refused to take the food back! And that food was crap as well. And I called upon the waiter to call his owner saying I want to complain- I was surprisingly told that it was the owner and his wife who cooks all the dishes themselves. !! Really??? If the owner cooks such crappy food- I wonder how long his restaurant would run.  Their buffet isnt too great either. The breads were cold and hard..almost like a layer of brick! Will NEVER go here again. Unless you want to waste your money, do not think of even entering this place!"}
{"text":"I think the only word you really need to know is: COCKROACHES... yes indeed we had one walk up the table and perch himself over our table, when we brought it up to the waitress she had us stand up and then reached over and killed it with a napkin (while our food was still on the table). She didnt even apologize, she just brought the check over. That is pretty horrible, the owner or manager doesnt even come over? So we brought her back and asked for some kind of discount since its nasty as hell in there and we were all nauseously trying to keep the \"Indian\" food down. (and yes it gets scare quotes because that was some shitty \"Indian\" food.. have you ever had a palak paneer without cream? made with frozen spinach????) So she goes to talk to the guy behind the bar and then just throws the bill on the table without a word... If we were jerks about it that I would understand but no we were pretty nice about the whole deal...  so my husband goes to the guy behind the bar and he then gives us a 10% discount, spluttering, \"the place upstairs was just fumigated\" yeah right... and my name is Kumar....its quite concerning that a roach is just going to show up on the wall and chill out under bright lights... that usually is indicative of an infestation.   But mostly it was just the way the owner/manager and the waitress treated us. we didnt put your roach there dudes,  have some graciousness and treat us nice, say your sorry, come over to our table, take a meal off the bill, give us a glass of wine or a dessert. SOMETHING.   I felt like these people just want you to go, eat like cows at their buffet trough then F off and leave them money. it was horrible."}
{"text":"Wow. What poor service. Twice I have had a nightmare trying to get food from this place. Aside from the fact that the food from here is generally average and fully of butter and oil, I ordered Chicken Malai one time, luckily I tasted it before feeding it to my daughter because it was Vindaloo. Just today I ordered Chicken Madras, a \"2 out of 10\" spiciness. Again, thankfully I tasted it before I gave it to my daughter because it burned like crazy. I love spicy food. I make my own hot sauce and I put Sriracha on almost everything! This was so hot. If I had fed it to my daughter she would have cried all night. The best part is that I brought the food back to the restaurant. The owner or manager actually tasted my food with a spoon (who does that?) and told me \"This is not spicy! It is Indian food!\" Stay away from here unless you want food that puts you in a coma or if you want food that is not what you ordered!"}
{"text":"Best Indian Restaurant ever! I have tried Indian Restaurants all over the world and none comes close to Coriander. The restaurant is currently undergoing renovation. Once it is complete the line to get in is going to be out the door."}
{"text":"We visited Pittsburgh and we went for lunch buffet on a rainy Sunday afternoon. Unlike other Indian restaurants, weekend buffet items are not exhaustive. Given that we are vegetarians, the item list got much shorter for us. But it is OK for us. My wife and kid liked the items very much. Parking is a hassle. There is a paid parking lot behind the restaurant but we parked on the street. Will visit again if we are around there."}
{"text":"Coriander is a relatively new Indian restaurant that opened in the Squirrel Hill section of Pittsburgh (where Rhoda's used to be, for long timers in the area.) I got a lot of ads in the mail about them, so as a buffet sampler, I went there for a lunch visit.  Overall, it is a small buffet, but eclectic. On buffet mechanics: everything was well marked (I saw only one mislabeled sign --  switched tamarind sauce/mint chutney labels), the food seemed reasonably fresh, not dried out, well/continuously stocked. Plenty of plates and utensils, dirty dishes removed and drinks refreshed often. I estimate the place was about 1/2 full on a weekday lunch. Getting the check was slow (I saw several other diners walk up to the cash register rather than wait.)  The food was very good, but not the superlatives that I see in other reviews. What struck me was the presence of so many dishes that I never see on buffets. To start, they had two excellent soups: Rasam (spicy tomato/lentil) and mulligatawny (veg). They were the highlights in my opinion. I also very much liked the Idli, which I think were appetizers -- I never had them before and I was told they were made from rice powder. Like a nicely seasoned, lightly fried, fluffly biscuit. There was a nice daal dish that was well seasoned and not \"soupy\". The spinach/cheese (paneer) was good. There was a peas/mushroom/other veggie dish that was different but ok.  They also had an interesting ocra in cream sauce. The aloo gobi (potato/cauliflower) was unremarkable, well, one good remark: it's wasn't greasy (sometimes this dish comes out smothered in oil). For meats, there was a curried chicken, tandori chicken and tikka masala chicken. All pretty bland (but the tandori did not look dried out, which was good.) The curried chicken had bones in it -- I know there are two thoughts, with bones cooks better, without bones eats easier, so I simply observe. The desert was labeled Gajar Halwa but tasted to me like soggy shredded carrots.  The buffet had the usual condiments, including mixed pickles with a real mix in them: citrus, garlic, carrots and other stuff. There was some cut melon, lettuce pieces, some flavored cut up mango that was new to me, some raita, and some cold flavorless chickpea/onion dish. White rice and plain naan were also present.  I noticed that the buffet stations had small stacks of labels at each spot. I infer that the dishes on the buffet rotate among quite a selection (it's a big regular menu), so you may very likely see something entirely different when you go. But if your experience is like mine, there will be a handful of really outstanding dishes among the collection, which will result in a nice meal.  PS: I saw a claim somewhere that there is parking behind the restaurant. What that means is that there is a public, metered lot next to the place, for $1/hr (likely to go up by the time you read this if the Pittsburgh mayor gets his way)."}
{"text":"For some reason all the other Indian restaurants are closed on Monday, and since I had a hankering for Indian food, I checked up coriander's website and saw that it was open till 10 pm , since it was already 9:25 I called them up to ask if they would still serve us and upon receiving an affirmation we made a reservation reached there 10 minutes later. Upon reaching the maître d' seats us.  This is when things start going wrong, the owner turns up and refuses to serve us, we actually had to get up from our seat. When the owner left the maître d' offered to take order for a take away and then tried to push drinks on us ( not free, and no discount either).While we were waiting another person from the establishment suggested that we were pretty lucky that they were taking our order for a take away. The food was pretty average, with the chicken chettinad tasting nothing like a chicken chettinad. So to sum up if you wish to eat average Indian food and not feel welcome, Coriander India Grill is the place to be"}
{"text":"I tried the buffet about 2 weeks ago. Granted it was only $6.99, but the food was bland. Maybe i'm not a buffet person. Not impressed, was hoping for something really good."}
{"text":"This place was excellent!  I had a lamb dosa, and veggie khorma, and naan  and it was all excellent.  They have a decent beer selection as well."}
{"text":"Love this place. My boyfriend and I eat here at least once a week...sometimes more! The buffet is great, too, for a quick lunch!"}
{"text":"The service was good. My husband ordered mutton Marsala over 50% of the main coarse was bone and scraps. When he asked the waitress she said that is normal for mutton I should have requested lamb. Interesting the cost of mutton with scraps is the same as lamb meat."}
{"text":"The buffet here has great choices; is very tasty; reasonably priced; and all you can eat.  Casual ambiance and OK service"}
{"text":"\"Sub-par\" would be generous.  We had Pani Poori, Mutter Paneer, and Chicken Tikka Masala. We've eaten a lot of Indian food and are big fans. All three of these dishes would be described as the worst version we've ever had.  Pani poori- the panis were stale and came with stew instead of the tasty veggies that dish is supposed to come with.  Chicken tikka masala- the chicken was mushy from having marinated in salt water for a long time, and it had huge raw onion slices on top.  The mutter Paneer was a special kind of terrible. It tasted like frozen peas sautéed in expired skim milk, with some store-bought Paneer thrown in.  Service was gruff, including a manager (I guess manager- he was kind of doing expo) who accusingly asked \"Are you done yet?\" as we sat there with only our water glasses... Waiting for for the check.  I have no idea how this place has 3.5 stars. Reading the reviews, you'll notice that all of the terrible reviews are from people who know Indian food. All of the good reviews are from people who begin with things like \"I've never had Indian food before, but...\"  I sincerely hope that those people get to try good Indian food- fresh ingredients, bold favors- some day, because Corriander --emphatically-- is not it."}
{"text":"Excellent food! A million times better than India Garden.  I had the buffet, there were a lot of good vegetarian options. There were the traditional favorites, as well as some new dishes I had never heard of before. The menu also has a good variety.  The service is still lacking, but they have only been open about a week, and it has been very busy, so that is to be expected. I am sure it will all work itself out. I love the atmosphere. It is pretty open, with a lot of seating, and nice green paint. There are a few tvs playing Bollywood movies and songs."}
{"text":"Try the dishes from the a la carte menu if you want some tasty food. The buffet isn't that great, the food is too sweet for me and the choices have been pretty much the same.   We can't remember the names of the food that we've ordered so far, but they're all delicious. Some of the dishes can be made spicy--from 1-10 how spicy would you like your food to be? I love spicy food, so I usually go for a 7 and above. The service is pleasant as the waiters are friendly. The price is reasonable for the portion and taste we get."}
{"text":"The food at this establishment was horrible! The food was cold and when we tried to ask for a warm dish we found a hair in our food. The rudest service I've ever received once we politely pointed out the issues insisting we pay in cash and leave. Besides being cold, the food was also very greasy with NO flavor. Go to Taj Mahal instead!"}
{"text":"This place has got from good to worse. I have been a regular customer here since they opened back in 2010. The owner Victor was very attentive then and the food was great. But since the last 1.5 years, this place has been going downhill. I have got takeouts from them a number of times in the last 5/6 months where the food was not satisfactory. A couple of times I got Goat item, but the amount of meat is so minuscule. Also, the quality of the food has gone downhill. I told the owner a couple of times about the food quality, but he  simply has a dont care mentality and even once he asked me what do you expect with 11/12 dollars. With new restaurants like All India serving quality indian food, I dont see Coriander staying in business too long with such an unprofessional attitude."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place to me and I'm so glad she did. The food is some of the best Indian food I've had. My friend and I split the Coriander Special Platter which had a sampling of the best Indian appetizers like paneer with a crispy chick pea batter and samosa. I also got the Non-veg combination dinner. Everything was delicious and they got my perfect spicy level spot on. The prices are perfectly reasonable and it's a lovely environment.  GO!"}
{"text":"Always good food from Coriander - sets the standard for other Indian restaurants - fast delivery also. Love the Saag, Tikka Masala, & Samosas"}
{"text":"Food was very good.  We had the lamb sagwala and the chicken tikka masala, which are our usual standards for Indian restaurants, and both were well above par.  Service was a bit slow when we first got there, but once they took our orders things came out quickly.  They've apparently got a liquor license on the way, which will be nice when they get it."}
{"text":"I'm Indian and so I obviously love Indian food! Me and my husband thought of trying this place after seeing some good reviews. Seriously, what are the people who have given good reviews even thinking? Since the whole of Pittsburgh doesn't have a single chat place, I got excited about bhel and samosa chat and ordered it - it was pathetic! The taste was terrible and the onion in it felt days old. So we sent it back and the manager came back saying, there is nothing wrong with it. Really? Horrible service!  The naan was bad too and a couple other chicken dishes we had were terrible. Never going there again!"}
{"text":"I'm all for seeing a good Indian place in Pittsburgh. Sadly, Coriander is not it. I'm mystified as to how they have a high rating. Here's what I got :  Take out of the Veg Thali(Combination Order) , it came with three curries, a Veg Samosa, Rice, Naan, Kheer (Dessert) and Raita (Yoghurt with stuff in it)  I'd asked for a Medium Spice level, but all three curries were cream-heavy and tasteless - to the point that all three tasted the same ! I know once was supposed to be Dal Makhni, One was supposed to be Navratan Korma, and one was supposed to be Mattar Paneer.  The Veg Samosa had salt sprinkled on the outside as an afterthought, and the filling had no taste / spice whatsoever.  The Kheer was bitter ! A dessert is supposed to be sweet , not bitter ! Especially not Kheer.  Even the Raita had no Salt , no tanginess at all. I'm convinced all the reviews on Yelp are either by relatives, friends or people clueless about Indian Food."}
{"text":"One of the worst Indian restaurants I have been to. And as an Indian traveling so much, I have had a lot of tastings in a lot of towns.  I gave it two chances. First time, I ordered North Indian food. One out of three entrees was decent, one bad and one horrible. In one spice level way too high and the other two completely bland (NO it was not indicated as such on the menu). Vegetables tasted stale and daal seemed as if from yesterday or even day before. It was just bad.  Next time, I ordered South Indian dish. The sambhar and coconut chatni were stale and absolutely horrible tasting.  Will never go to this place again..."}
{"text":"SMALL PORTIONS. I'm done with this place. The food is pretty good. I usually order the same two dishes and have been satisfied with the flavors. However, over a stretch of about 8 months, one problem consistently remains the same: ridiculously small portions. I've gotten the most meager portions of food of any Indian restaurant I've visited anywhere. A few other reviewers here have also commented on the small portions.  My most recent visit was the last straw. I get home and the Paneer Butter Masala barely covers the bottom of the container. On the other hand, the rice was overflowing from its styrofoam box. Was this supposed to divert my attention away from the lack of food?  I call and talk to the manager, and he explains to me that $10 gets you 16 ounces of food. That should tell you how carefully they're measuring the portions. Whereas any ethical owner of a restaurant would try to accommodate their customers, this guy argues with me and basically says take it or leave it. They're either struggling to stay afloat or pretty damn confident that they don't have any competition for miles.  I'd like to see them try and survive on Devon Ave in Chicago with this kind of service and attitude."}
{"text":"I love Indian food. I have to admit that I'm not sure Coriander has the best Indian food I've ever eaten (that is likely saved for my favorite restaurant in Seattle) and their naan is a little disappointing, but in the month that I've lived in Pittsburgh, my family and I have been to Coriander three times. The food is consistently good, there is an excellent selection of vegetarian items on the menu (to be expected) and half the buffet is vegetarian and it is also conveniently located in our general neighborhood.  What puts this place over the top is the service. They are the nicest people. We have two small kids and they dote on them. On two separate occasions, we've been there on Sunday for the buffet and my daughter thought the food was too spicy and they made her a non-spicy dish (per her request \"orange with peas and tofu cheese\") at no extra charge.   We will probably try some other Indian restaurants, but so far, I'm very happy with Coriander."}
{"text":"Nice Indian restaurant. I went there first since my friend who is a regular of this restaurant invited me. Since then, I became a regular too. Good atmosphere, reasonable price and nice owner. I usually have Xacuti which is a regional food of the cook's home town. I like the spiciness very much. Sometime soon, I will try the lunch buffet too."}
{"text":"Consistent! The food is borderline delicious from the biryani rice to the tandoori chicken. I've eaten a variety of things from this Resteraunt. However I've ordered for the table three times now and because not everyone can deal with Indian heat I order it to be as low in heat as possible and they have constantly ignored my request. To add to that I've ordered take out twice and they forgot an item both times. The last time was my the final straw. I called the restaurant and a man told me he didn't believe me and insisted I take a picture of my order before he would refund the money for the item he forgot. He also refused to bring the missing item to me. Poor service. Taste of India in Bloomfield/Lawerenceville is ten times better in every way."}
{"text":"This wonderful Indian restaurant is in the space occupied for many years by Rhoda's deli, which has been beautifully refurbished. But it is the food that grabs your attention. Food so good you can't believe it. Food so good you want to lick the plate. It has an extensive menu with a number of dishes that you don't normally find in Pittsburgh (you can see the menu at http://www.allmenus.com/pa/pittsburgh/294309-coriander-india-grill/menu). The menu includes a section of Goan specialties, a section of \"Indian Chinese\", a South Indian section with a variety of  dosa as well  as idli (steamed rice and lentil cakes) and vada (fried lentil donuts) all served with south indian sambal and chutney.  And then there are sections of vegetarian dishes, seafood, lamb and goat, chicken, tandoori, and rice dishes. Every section of the menu has something you've not seen on a local menu before.  We wanted to order one of each, but had to settle for a couple of appetizers, a chili-cheese dosa and a goat curry.  The service was impeccable: polite, attentive, and quick without being rushed. The kind and friendly waiters kept an eye on us from a distance so that water was poured and food was produced just when we were ready for it.  And OMG, the food. was. spectacular.  All of the chutneys were exceptionally delicious; appetizers were perfectly cooked and attractively garnished; and then came the entrees. Best dosa ever. The rice pancake was huge - about 18 inches wide- delicate and crisp but meltingly soft inside. And the curry was excellent as well, plenty of meat in a sauce that was richly spiced and thick with deliciousness.  Unfortunately no room for dessert, but the dessert menu was also interesting."}
{"text":"we went over for dinner and were craving the taste of home,we ordered the black daal,chicken tikka masala and naan,the daal was excellent the chicken and naan were good,,they had that yummy mint chutney and pickles to choose from and a nice selection of wines..they even have TVs with the bollywood song and dance channel on...enjoy!"}
{"text":"As a connoisseur of Indian cuisine, we know good Indian food and this was definitely not.  Save your money and go to Taj Mahal or Tamarind instead.     Dishes were overpriced.  Kabobs and Chicken Tikka were small and tasteless.  Chicken fried rice tasted like a bad biryani.  Butter chicken was average, but nothing special.  You really can't screw up naan either.  The only good thing was the rasmalai and it was probably made with a packet of Gits from the Indian grocery.  They may have some better options, but we were extremely disappointed with everything we tried.    Hopefully the food quality, portions, and prices will improve; otherwise, this isn't the only Indian restaurant in town (thankfully)."}
{"text":"Tried their lunch buffet today, and was pretty disappointed by the lack of variety. Taste-wise, it wasn't bad, but wasn't anything worth raving about either.   The waiter was being especially creepy and annoying too. He would constantly stare at my table and whenever one of us stood up to get food from the buffet area, he would subtly follow us and stare us down as we got our food. I don't think that was necessary. I know how a buffet works.   I would probably not come back here because of the negative service. There are also many other better Indian buffet alternatives around the area."}
{"text":"Don't get the buffet unless you are new to Indian foods. It's bland. It has the common Indian offerings and that's where the buffet ends.  Get the goat biriyani. Out of this world! Get it Indian spicy (if you can handle that) for true flavor."}
{"text":"Full Disclosure-I typically eat out once per week and I enjoy trying different restaurants and writing reviews about the experience. I often purchase coupons through groupon and other companies to reduce the costs and allow me to try some additional restaurants that I might not normally dine in without them.  Today I wanted to try some ethnic cuisine so I opted to go to Coriander Grill in Squirrel Hill. The place appears to have a set of regulars as is consistent to most restaurants in Squirrel Hill. I previously tried their uninspiring but inexpensive lunch buffet, but I wanted to give them another chance and I had a coupon that I purchased for $7.99 that was for food purchases up to $20 not including tax and gratuities. I entered into the dim and dark restaurant and stopped by the sign wait to be seated. The attendant looked at me several times and unlike most establishments, opted to point at an open table as opposed to meeting, greeting, and escorting me there. Strike one! She asked if I wanted the lunch buffet and I declined and asked for the menu. I ordered an appetizer of coconut shrimp and an entrée that included chicken tiki masala, rice, and butter naan bread. I was asked how hot I wanted the dish on a scale of 1-10 and I elected 9 as I enjoy spicy cuisine. The coconut shrimp were tasty. I opted to try 2 of the 3 sauces that it was served with and only enjoying one of them. The main dish was uninspiring even with the added spice request. I have made better chicken tiki at home in a slow cooker with baked chicken breast and store bought sauce. Despite the lackluster service, I still intended on tipping about 24 percent as I was already have a discounted meal thanks to the coupon. My coupon had an expiration date of March 2017 and had no restrictions on the amount spent nor the time used. Upon collecting the check, I informed the waitress that the $20 coupon would cover the meal portion that totaled $19.97 and I left $6 for the tax and tip. The waitress gave me multiple excuses as to why they would not accept the coupon. The first was that they no longer are offering the coupons, which wouldn't apply to someone who purchased it previously and is using it over 5 months prior to expiration. The next thing was that she couldn't apply the coupon because the total amount was $19.97. She indicated multiple times that I could still use the coupon but that it had to exceed $20, so if I spent $30 or $40 I could use it. There was no indication on the coupon that the purchase price had to exceed $20 (this is typically indicated when this is a legitimate requirement). So I offered to order an additional item to bring the pre-tax total above $20 as she indicated. When she saw that I simply would order a $2 pink lemonade, she went and said that her manager will not accept the coupon and that I had to get my money back from the third party that they listed it through. So essentially, the rules kept changing to benefit Coriander Grill, they would not honor their own coupon, and the manager would never come out although the waitress claims that he is the one changing the rules. If this place is dishonest and uses false advertisements and discounts to attract business (They obviously need to generate traffic by advertising this way) then how can you trust their morals in preparing your food. This is the first Indian Food establishment in Pittsburgh that I have had subpar service and quality. Avoid the aggravation, there are better options. You will likely be glad that you did!"}
{"text":"I love their buffet! Everything tastes sooo good! The fried little donuts they have is literally the best one I have ever had. Wish they were a little less expensive: A lot of Indian buffet restaurants around the area are at the 10$ price range, so it makes it harder to choose Coriander over them. Also the music shows they play on the TV is so annoying. I do not understand why they feel like they should play music videos so loudly. Some music on a reasonably low volume for the ambiance? Sure! But loud love music video playing during my meal? No!"}
{"text":"Breaking it down:  the Samosas were a 2.5 stars (Potatoes and cilantro???) , good wrap though.  The Naan was naan.  Well baked but about average at 3 stars.  The Kashmiri Dum Aloo was a pleasant suprise and i would give it five stars.  It was well spiced (about perfect 6 out of 10), creamy, and the potatoes were well cooked (not mushy and not to hard).  Last was the Vegetable Jalfrezi, a well made dish that gets one star knocked off for being a bit too heavy on the cooking oil.    The rice was perfect.  The service kept my water glass full.  I enjoyed the Bollywood videos on the tv's as well.  I will be back to sample more of thier menu."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night and to the very least it was disgusting. Service was poor, smelly interior, and food inedible. I know what good Indian food tastes like and this was not it. Would not go back or recommend to others. \"STAY AWAY\"."}
{"text":"We purposely drove along the Penna. turnpike with growling stomachs for hours, just because we were jonesing for Indian.  It was quite a gamble, as we usually can't withstand our hunger pains and give in to a sandwich at Sheets.    We staggered into Coriander in a low blood sugar-induced coma-like state, and the friendly host promptly seated us in a booth.  A minute later, some crispy chips arrived with the ubiquitous triangular serving dish containing chutney, the green stuff, and the brown stuff.  I have no idea what these substances are, but we love them!  The momentary raise in our sugar levels allowed us to review the menu and place our orders: lamb vindaloo (10 on the hotness scale) and palak paneer (7 on the hotness scale.)  We were tempted to get south Indian dosas, as they are so hard to come by as most restaurants focus on northern Indian fare, but we didn't want to gamble.   The food came promptly, and it was delicious!  The vindaloo didn't disappoint with the spicy heat, but I should have been more conservative in anticipating my ability to absorb fire.  That was my fault, not theirs.  I even said when ordering, \"Make it a 10.  I've been to India before, so I know what that means.\"  Idiocy.  My wife's palak paneer was creamy and dreamy.    We walked out of the restaurant with full bellies and korma-eating grins on our faces.  We'll be back next time we're in Pittsburgh, Coriander India Grill!"}
{"text":"Buffet on weekdays is awesome.  Foods are fresh, tasty, and the atmosphere great.  Place is easy-going and friendly: vegetarian options are plentiful and decadent.  As for a la carte, the portions are not 'small'. They are good sized, and those who love Indian dining, know that 'for two' means usually perhaps, say, 3 different kinds of appetizers and 3-4 main courses-- idea is to taste, share and enjoy.  Coriander makes that very easy.  It reminds me of some of the better dining experiences I've had in London."}
{"text":"I recently ate here for the first time, with a friend from out of town. I ordered the spinach/ sag paneer and it had the consistency and taste of baby food. My friend's dish was bland as well.   There might be better tasting dishes available but I am not going back to find out. I was really disappointed with the whole experience, especially because I had been bragging to my friend how great pittsburgh Indian food is."}
{"text":"Had the lamb xacuti and it was amazing! The service was extremely friendly and very responsive. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Well I'm sad to report that this place has slid. The owner / main guy - whatever - is always really nice and remembers my preferences, which is nice, so it's sad to write this. The buffet is now not only smaller, it is less flavorful and less tended to. The tamarind today was extremely watery. I assume they are in stuff competition for college students with All India on Craig, but it's a shame that means cutting quality corners. Unexpectedly Disappointing experience today."}
{"text":"I got takeout from Coriander last week. We ordered Chicken Tikka Masala and Aloo Gobi, a cauliflower-potato dish. The food does not taste authentic. The quality of the chicken was mediocre, the Tikka Masala sauce lacking in spice and flavor. Frankly it reminded me of a spiced tomato vodka sauce. I'm familiar with what this dish should taste like. It appeared as though they had used dried herbs.  Even the Naan was no good! How is that possible? I love Indian cuisine and this is close to my home. Too bad it's not to my standards.  They had a full bar!"}
{"text":"Food was average at best.  Rasam was thick and opaque... Not clear and tangy with the flavor of tamarind.  Buffet left a lot to be desired.  Chicken was full of bones with little meat .... Raita was ok... Kheer was disgusting.. I didn't taste one hint of cardamom.  Worst of all, I introduced myself to Victor ( owner?) because I was interested in holding a 30 person party here in a few weeks.  He showed me the area and then never said another word to me for the rest of lunch.  The waiter also had no personality and seemed bothered to wait on my mother and I.  I told my Indian husband that I think they treated me this way because I'm not Indian and he  said... No.. They will treat all this way.  Very disappointing and rude staff.  I must say the waitress with short hair was nice.  I will never set foot in this restaurant again"}
{"text":"Well, myself & husband have been here 3 times. Out of all the nice expensive restaurants we go to my husbands says the food has the wow factor here. It is very good food with great service. The only negativity was when we went there last I ordered a dish that was to be a 0 heat level, they did not explain to me that there wasnt a way to do it so they came out with this cream sauce to make it milder. Well it was probably a heat of 3-4 and the sauce brought it down to a 2 which it was still hot. I wish they would have just said it can't be done but they didn't. I guess I wont be getting that dish again. All and all a great restaurant. If you like Indian food & reasonable rates you have to go to Coriander!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are avid Indian food fans. We have been looking for places in Squirrel Hill and came across this lovely gem while walking down Murray Ave. We stopped in for dinner and were thrilled with how awesome it turned out to be. The perfect date spot! We love trying places from all over and this was by far one of the best places we've had Indian. The food was perfect and soo delicious. The waitstaff was friendly and very helpful. Food was decently priced and perfectly flavored. We cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"As an Indian person, I will start by saying that the food here is good and worth coming to eat. However, having now been here twice I can say that the service is rude/bad (mixed up spice level on orders, never refilled water, lied about the TV not working when we asked if it was possible to put the NBA finals on given that no one was looking at the TV) and the attempts to swindle the customer are omnipresent. After eating a 2 person meal, we noticed that we were charged 3 dollars for rice and a further 4 dollars of nebulous \"service charge\" on our meal. The check then came back after giving a credit card saying that the total was the \"pre-tip\" amount. While this is sadly not that surprising from unfriendly Indian restaurant owners (which is becoming a trope, and makes friendly Indian restaurant owners a refreshing change), I found it pretty low and offensive. I say this as someone who is rarely offended by service."}
{"text":"I used to love this place, but recently this year they seem to have really cut corners and the service which is slow has gotten rude as well. A friend and I ordered take out for the first time and the food arrived quickly ( which I was surprised, 20 mins from the 60 min estimate from Wheel Deliver) only to be cold and made my friend violently ill within 10 minutes of eating it. She called the manager to tell him about her food poisoning and he basically called her a liar over the phone. Never going back, good bye the good old days when the service was friendly, thalis were on the menu and the buffet was actually good."}
{"text":"Very tasty Indian buffet and cuisine! Plenty of vegetarian options at the buffet which was awesome because I like to try a little of everything. Great paneer palak, great flavors, and pretty great service too! Perfectly spicy."}
{"text":"Coriander is an excellent addition to the many Indian restaurants in the Pittsburgh area. As someone who frequently eats Indian food, I was aware on my first visit that this restaurant came from a departing member of India Garden, but it is not an offshoot of the original. While the food is different and good, the owner took the weaknesses of his former experience and prefected the issues there. Happy employees would be the most notable difference, which is a great relief.  I have been to Coriander several times now, only ordering off of the menu. However, by the size of their buffet tables and signs, it would appear to be extensive. What you should note about the menu is that it is extensive. You will find a wide variety of all of your favorite Northern Indian dishes, some new ones too, Southern Indian selections, and the hard to find Manchurian or Indo-Chinese dishes. The paneer Manchurian entree is so good. The items that I have ordered have been excellent, well spiced, and worth going back for another trip.  As others have reported, I have found the service here to be excellent, with attentive and happy faces to help you at every turn. The dining room is an expansive space, filled with many booths and walls in bright, clean colors. This place would be good for a larger party of guests. There is a full bar in house as well as several large TVs that play clips from Bollywood films. I believe on game days for major PGH sports they play the game also."}
{"text":"Pathetic service and super cold food!  The bad/rude service was a first time experience for me. The manger (or whoever that person was) didn't have basic etiquette while serving customers. We went for buffet lunch and basic cutlery like spoons and bowls were not provided for eating. When we requested for spoons we were told to get up from our seats and fetch it ourselves. When we went and picked it up, the spoons turned out to be tiny dessert spoons instead. After that we requested for bowls so that we can eat the food in a manageable manner. But apparently they don't provide bowls (funny!) and you are supposed to put the currys on the plate and eat (messy!). When we picked up dessert bowls instead to eat, we were rudely told by the manager and his wife to not use them.    Lastly, while we were eating our food half-way through, the manager's wife came and threw the bill at our table and left! And top it off, throughout our dining experience the waiter there was constantly standing next to our table and staring (creepy!)  Now talking about the food. Food was extremely cold and obviously the waiters/managers didn't care about it as well. Naan (bread) was extremely hard. And the currys were watery with no taste in it.   Overall there are way better Indian restaurants in nearby locality for the same or cheaper price with better ambience, service and food! This place was quite horrible and I will never be going to this place again."}
{"text":"Very good food. Fast. But never tell them 5 for spices. You won't be able to finish the food."}
{"text":"My wife and I dropped in on Saturday night this past week.   Decent crowd near the bar. The overall ambiance is a bit broken up with the front part of the restaurant feeling empty and bit bland. The booths near the bar and the tables toward the back are much more welcoming. Decor is nice in this area.  We ordered the standards for us - Palaak Paneer and Chicken Tikka Masala with Naan. The Palaak Paneer left a lot to be desired. It was pretty bland. The Tikka Masala was really tasty though. And the Naan was really good! Might be the best around!  We were served quickly and professionally. They have a full bar, which we thought was impressive for a small Indian restaurant.  Overall, we will probably stop in again.  It was a good spot to have dinner before a movie in Squirrel Hill."}
{"text":"I have been there twice (but not recently, so maybe things are better than they used to). First time, we had to wait nearly 45 minutes to be served. Second time, the food was very very mediocre: my dosa was filled with low-quality ground beef... The room itself is dark and unpleasantly organized."}
{"text":"I love this place! My favorite Indian buffet place in squirrel hill because of the awesome weekday lunch price $10 for as much Indian food as you can eat. Most of the food is absolutely delicious (curries, naan, rice, rice pudding, desserts). The only food that is meh is the fried food (samosas and this other small fried fish they have-- don't remember the name). Restaurant pretty big so there's never a wait! Would love for more fresh veggies and fruit. Would definitely recommend to a friend :)"}
{"text":"worst indian restaurant i've been to. the food tasted bland, the saag paneer was a cardboard version of others I've had.   would only recommend if you really love indian and don't like to leave Squirrel Hill."}
{"text":"this is the worst indian restaurant experience  i had ever had. I was there to have dinner with a body of mine who came to visit me from florida. I took him to thus place and turned out to be a disaster. The wait staff was completely lost and barely spoke or understood english. We ordered 2 glasses of wine and by the time we drank the whole wine we were not even waited for appetizers. The couple sitting behind my table was complaining about their appetizer not being served after 50 minutes. finally when their appetizer came on the table , went right back to the kitchen with the complain of fish being very tasteless and salty.  Finally a lady who did not even seem like a waitress and was dressed like in a house came and tried to wait on us . When i asked how long would it take for the appetizer, she replies in a  rude manner at least 30 minutes. I had no choice to leave after drinking a glass of red wine.   This experience is never forgiven or forgotten.I will never return to this place ever in my life nor recommend anybody about this place. My night with my buddy turned out to be a disaster ."}
{"text":"The food was tasty.  Not great, but not bad either.  Where it really lost stars, however, was the service.  We waited for our check for an hour and had to ask for it several times. Not okay, Coriander."}
{"text":"Delicious Indian food!   I've had the lamb dose, the meat Thali, the butter chicken, and every item on the buffet. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I had been here for lunch buffet... less variety of food.. food was not tasty... service is poor.. naan was over i asked for it and he took ages to get that..  chicken tikka was taste less... will NOT recommend. Do not waste money by going to this place.."}
{"text":"My first time going to Coriander, I was seriously unimpressed. The naan was gooey, and the Chicken tikka masala wasn't cutting it (the chicken chunks were, considering that they are drowning in sauce, dry). But, Coriander has redeemed itself on the second try, and I'm now willing to come back again.   Naan was much better this time - fluffy. We had the saag paneer, which was exceptionally creamy, in a way that made it almost too rich. We also had a vegetarian dish that uses the Korma sauce, which I thought was delicious. Finally, we also tried one of their house specialties (which comes from a particular region of India, can't recall the particulars now, but they are in their own special section in the menu) and boy was that stuff strong. Spicy both in terms of spices used and in terms of heat. I couldn't handle it, even though we had requested everything to be mild.  So, overall, not a bad place to go, and we'll probably come back again. I still prefer Taste of India (on Penn), but the service here is nice and this is much closer."}
{"text":"Good Indian from a person that doesn't know squat about Indian food. Great butter chicken. I love spicy food but they make everything flavorful without any spice.  That is great because I love exposing my kid to all sorts of different flavors and cultures.  I can easily and safely give him anything from the buffet and not be even concerned that it is crazy indian spicy and will kill the kid.  He loves indian food. So if you ask Elliott- This place is NUMBER ONE, 5 stars.    I think its just fine.  The lunch buffet is the best deal.  I only go during a buffet can I eat like a PIG."}
{"text":"I would recommend Coriander for take-out, but definitely do not plan to eat-in there. The service was pretty awful and slow.   I went with 3 other people, so we were 2 vegetarians and 2 meat-eaters. They had a good variety of food and everyone enjoyed their meals when they finally arrived, but we all got our food at different times. One of my friends did not get her appetizer until everyone else had finished theirs and we had reminded them several times. I think that they ended up not charging us for that because it was so ridiculously delayed. My husband's main course was also extremely late.There was maybe one other table of people in the restaurant so there was no reason for them to be overwhelmed with our order.   I also did not like that they gave us one bowl of rice instead of everyone getting their own portions (all entrees come with rice) and they mixed together our bread orders in one basket (I ordered whole wheat roti and everyone else ordered naan, so it was hard to tell what was what). My husband and I each ordered a beer but they only brought us one, so I guess they expected us to share that too.  They gave us some complimentary sorbet at the end of the meal, I guess as an apology for how slow and disorganized they were, so that was a nice gesture. As I said, the food was good but they seem to have some serious service/communication issues, so I would only trust them for take-out in the future."}
{"text":"This place is just okay. I saw the star rating and wasn't too thrilled, but it was the closest Indian buffet that was open on Easter Sunday, where they were only serving buffet that day, and for a deal of 11.99 per person, before tax.   The taste of the food was great!  No complaints, though i have had better at All India. There were cupcakes as dessert at the buffet. Odd.   Service was soooo weird. The young server girl seemed terrified to get near us, took a while to refill our empty water glasses, and just looked dazed/confused/mortified by strangers.  She also disappeared when it came time to pay the check.   Strangely enough, there was a violist playing music for the time we were there. Her page turner friend had the most bored look on his face.  We weren't sure if we should clap or not when she'd finish each song. Once the dinner crowd mostly left, she stopped playing and got a free to go box to fill up by the staff. Huh. Were we supposed to tip her, or is she just being paid in food?  Also, I noticed several times some white dudes would walk in and just go straight to the bar, order a shot and a beer or just a beer, chug it, and leave. They have a full bar, so get ready for that amusing encounter.   All in all, I will come back here for the okay food.   Another tip: Cell service sucks inside, and it's very dark. Street parking only!"}
{"text":"Been here several times for the buffet..., not the best Indian food ..., but again if you are really craving Indian food and don't have the car to drive places..... This can put those Indian cravings to rest..."}
{"text":"Lunch buffet is a steal plus there curries are great and you can order spiceness on a star rating which is rare for an indian resturant.  Goat lamb chicken all great."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre, seemed like all the flavors were muted, like the color of the food. The chicken dosa was meh, pretty bland and really dry. The mulligatawny soup needed salt and seasoning, the palak paneer was bland unless you count the single note heat that came soaring across your palette, and the samosa chaat was really dense and heavy in a bad way. The rice was good though...  so yeah to sum it up, the food is passable, but it's not great."}
{"text":"Coriander is a pretty basic Indian food place. Nothing too special, nothing too terrible. The lunch buffet is good, and most entrees I've experienced (seen/tried/etc) have been great, but there have been a few disappointments. The mimosas are definitely less than impressive, and service can sometimes be a little weird. If someone were to ask if I could tell where to get the best Indian food in Pittsburgh, I wouldn't say Coriander, but if someone asked if they should try Coriander, I would say go for it. There's a big chance your food will be good."}
{"text":"The second-best Indian buffet in the East end area, i'd say... Very clean/spartan, as well. (some Indian joints can be dingy .)  They tend to spice the dishes on the extreme side so, beware if you have the typical caucasian wimpy Pittsburgh palate where the slightest bit of heat is overwhelming.... Right on hippity hoppity Murray Avenue ..."}
{"text":"We have gone to Coriander several times with our two young children and have always had a decent experience with the food/service. The buffet is pretty good, there is a good variety of options, but we've always enjoyed the quality of the menu items when we have the time to sit and wait (the service itself has never been memorable). On our visit today we were very disappointed to see that we were charged for 2 \"kids' buffets.\" Our kids ate 3 bites of rice and nothing else, but we were informed by our server that this was a new charge for all kids under the age of 10. We've been to almost every indian buffet in Pittsburgh and have never been charged. For this reason I'm not sure how often we'll visit, but I do hope it does well since it's located in my neighborhood and is a good option to have."}
{"text":"My husband I recently got take out from here.   We both agreed vegetable pakoras were some of the best we've had. As was the chutney that came with them.  I was a little disappointed with the Masala Dosa having ordered it at other various Indian restaurants and gotten much larger portions. Plus, it was mainly dosa and very little filing.   The channa masala was also pretty good as was the palak paneer."}
{"text":"It was \"pretty okay.\" Didn't blow me away, but not bad either. Seemed a little overpriced for the quality.   We tried the garlic naan, palak paneer, and fish tikka masala -- the naan was probably the best out of the three. I wouldn't repeat the fish -- overcooked low quality fish which was kind of chewy. Also, underspiced -- I asked for it hot, but I tasted barely any heat to the dish. The mango lassi was pretty good though...  Decor was dingy with Bollywood on a couple of TVs. They do have a full bar, but only a few bar stools."}
{"text":"My experience here was wonderful (minus the construction on the adjoining hallway). The food was good. I got the Chicken Tikka  Masala and it was delicious. The chicken was a little fatty, but the sauce was great!i thought the staff was great and friendly! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Never coming back again. The food here is very bad (mostly frozen). Their dishes are pricy but the quality is really bad. The staff are not friendly. I will never come back again."}
{"text":"I love Coriander so much! Victor is wonderful, kind, and friendly. The waitresses are great as well and they always smile. :-) The buffet has a great selection and the entrees are always hot and delicious.  For beverages, the Mango Lassi is a go-to. I absolutely love the Chicken Soup. I've never had soup like this anywhere, and I love the lemon in it.  The vegetable samosas and pakoras are delicious when dipped in tamarind chutney!  The tandoori chicken is mouth-watering, tender, and falls right off the bone.  Naan is an essential. My favorites include Butter naan, Garlic naan, and Aloo naan.  I have a lot of vegetarian favorites: Chana Masala, Navratna Korma, Matar Paneer, Palak Paneer, and Daal Taadka.  My favorite chicken dishes are: Chicken Tikka Masala, Chicken Korma, Chicken Makhni/butter chicken, Chicken Saag, and Chicken Curry. It's always of the perfect spice level.  It's nice to end the meal with a dessert of gulab jamun and/or rice pudding.  One really unique aspect of Coriander is their 50% off hours! It's amazing! From 4-6pm and 9-10pm, they have a list of select dishes that are half-price!  Also, Coriander is available for pick-up or delivery orders.  I recommend this as your next meal: Chicken Soup, Daal Taadka, Chicken Saag, Aloon Naan!"}
{"text":"Good Indian food. You get a portion of rice with every curry, so order your breads judiciously. I loved their dal makhani"}
{"text":"The food was really good and I'll likely go back. The Samosa was quite good, the tandoori was delish, and the Biryani was pretty good but uber spicy. The one gripe was that we asked for 4 orders of naan, and were charged for 6; when I asked the server about it she basically said \"I gave you 3 garlic naan and the baskets contained 3 regular so 6 is correct\", not in any way acknowledging that we DIDN'T ACTUALLY ASK FOR THE ADDITIONAL 2 PIECES and were charged an extra $4 for naan that we didn't order. My friends didn't want me to be confrontational so we let it go; lose a star for that one. Our order was huge (~$100) so wondering if she thought we wouldn't notice."}
{"text":"Authentic; good price; short waiting time. Their veggie samosa was the worst I ever had though!"}
{"text":"Hmmm, Indian food...never had it.  But this past year has been about discovering new things and attempting to step outside of my comfort zone.  For some odd reason I thought this was going to be and experience like Ben Stiller had in one of his movies.  But not to fear, I had a wonderful time.  When we walked in, and I may add that was the only downfall, we were not greeted.  In fact we stood there for a few minutes and then were acknowledged from across the room by an employee who kind of nodded and then threw up the peace sign...er, I mean \"two\" sign, indicating how many were in our party.  Have I mentioned I have never tried Indian food before?  Oh, yeah, I suppose I have.  So looking over the menu was bit of a task for me.  Having to read the description to almost everyone of the items before deciding on the Mango Chicken Curry.  After selecting the spice level, everything was smooth sailing after that.  The ambiance in here was quite pleasant as well.  Had the Indian flair and the music coming from the TVs was quite entrancing.  Coming back here would be a delight for me.  Who said that stepping out of the box was a bad idea?"}
{"text":"There's something so satisfying about eating Indian food on a night when it's super cold outside. I want to give this place 4 stars for the taste of the food, but as a whole, the value for money could be better. We ordered the sizzling chicken tikka, vegetable Jal Farezi, Goan tilapia fish curry and tandoori roti. All with Indian spice levels, which was great! The chicken tikka and Jal Farezi were very tasty, but the fish curry could have been more exciting, especially for the $14 price. I would have liked chicken thigh parts for the chicken tikka instead of chicken breast as it was not as moist as I would have liked.   Service was good - pleasant waitress and fairly quick with the food. Ambience was a little strange - it seemed like a confused sports bar/Indian restaurant.   Overall, it's good. But again, considering all factors, I cannot give this place more than 3.5 stars. So I have rounded it down to 3."}
{"text":"Don't send an email with a question to this restaurant! I did 2 years ago--just wanted to know if they still did the lunch buffet--and to this day I continue to get spam carrying viruses from owner Victor Barboza's address. I've written numerous times asking to be removed from his address book, but I get no response and no action. To make matters worse, I ate there last month. Shrimp methi malai. Spent all night vomiting. I'll never go back. I cannot trust the owner's integrity."}
{"text":"Pathetic food and limited choices. Would not recommend to anyone looking out for some authentic Indian cuisine."}
{"text":"first visit today, early dinner at the buffet.  The entrees were split evenly between veg and non-veg, with a couple of desserts (a decent carrot halwa and fresh fruit) the naan was served hot, delicious. all the veg entrees were fresh-tasting and well-cooked but they were also bland ie low on the masala and salt.  The service was OK, I was not reloaded with napkins and water as often as I wanted.  They have a cool-looking bar with a good (albeit limited) selection of beers on tap.  The $10/head price is quite fair."}
{"text":"Squirrel Hill is starting to step up the culinary scene, y'all!  Coriander is delicious, authentic (well, that's what my Indian friends tell me), and reasonably priced.  I've been twice now, and each time we've eaten family style with the friends we were with so that everyone could try multiple dishes.  Now, everything was good, but the goat sagwala was the stand out dish.  That type of good where you start to get sad upon seeing that it's almost gone, or you want to stab your BFF for taking the last bite.  The goat is tender and not too gamy, the spices are perfectly blended, complementing the spinach and the goat.  Seriously, get this dish.    Because I'm not terribly familiar with the names of Indian dishes, I can't list everything I've had there, but I've liked it all.  The menu is pretty extensive, with several subheadings including a Chinese-Indian section.  I haven't tried the buffet, but unless you're in a hurry, I would recommend ordering off the menu.  The service at Coriander is attentive and pleasant, and they're happy to make recommendations."}
{"text":"I got the buffet. It was very good and fresh. I was pleasantly surprised that they had the buffet open until 3PM. I got the take-out for $6.99 and got enough food to last me for 2 or 3 lunches. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Delicious food.  Although they don't serve Chicken Vindaloo!  Pity. Also, their email address on their website doesn't work, so the only way to contact them is by phone when they are open.  That's also a pity."}
{"text":"Food is great! Decent service, quiet place.  I usually order take outs but it's a nice place to have dinner too!!"}
{"text":"My go to place when I'm in the mood for Indian. (Which is about twice a week lol)  The chicken tikka masala is one of the best I've had in my life. Sauce is so good! Perfect for dipping the naan. The vegetable samosa is also delicious.   Give the place a try, you won't be disappointed. Prices are reasonable too. :)"}
{"text":"Had no problem getting a table for 4 here early on a Saturday night.  We ordered 2 Karahi Aloo Gobis, a Matar Paneer, and a Palak Paneer.    I asked for my Aloo Gobi with all cauliflower and no potatoes, and they were very willing to accommodate me.  The mix of spices coupled with the bits of very aromatic tomato and onion was very delicious.  However, I had specified I wanted it very spicy (hot), and it came out relatively mild to my taste.    The Matar Paneer came out perfectly spiced to our palettes however, and the Palak Paneer was truly one of the best I've ever had.  It had a peculiar (and wonderful) aroma to me as if it had been cooked with schmaltz (chicken fat), although I doubt very much that an Indian restaurant would employ this fat in its cooking.  Regardless, the dish was beautifully umami.  The prices here are bit cheaper than other Pittsburgh Indian joints, though the portion sizes seem scaled down to match.  I almost always bring home leftovers from restaurant (and enjoy doing so), but did not from Coriander.  If we return, perhaps I'll order an extra dish for the table with these small portion sizes in mind."}
{"text":"I've been to Coriander a couple of times and have also ordered from them through Wheel Deliver, because sometimes I get hopelessly desperate for food resembling Indian cuisine. This last visit to the restaurant, I learned something very important and that is when you see a not-so-recently deceased clown fish on the bench in front of the aquarium where you would presumably wait to be seated or sit to view the otherwise lively aquatic environment, laugh and exit the establishment immediately. Don't sit there and continue to order a feast, no, don't.   I, stupidly, was able to stop peering at and laughing about the highly visible dried up and flat dead clown fish for long enough to order way too much food. Our server was new and did not know Indian food, at all. We had to slowly repeat and point to what we wanted; neither English nor any of the many Indian languages were her first language, poor girl - she probably knew about the fish - we imagined her internal struggle over what to do about it...it being her first day and all, worrying about whether she should tell anybody for fear she will be blamed or yelled at or forced to touch it, or maybe she should just pick it up already and get it out of sight, but then what if somebody sees her and attention is brought to the fact that there is indeed a dead fish and that a person who is also handling food is handling a rotting fish...  Sooo, enough with Finding Nemo and on to the deplorable food. We ordered vegetable samosas as our appetizer. They were flatter and smaller than the typical samosa, scantily spiced, and they seemed to have been frozen and microwaved (hardly) rather than deep fried. They were cold. Not greasy (like I think they should be). The chutneys and mango pickle all had the quality of having been born in a factory, canned, shelved for years, opened last week and sitting out all day before being served to us. I didn't try the papadam because I could tell that that too was cheaply manufactured. For entrees, the two of us shared Baingan Bharta, Aloo Gobi and a Dosa. The Dosa was ice cold, pale white and, well, I never knew they could be frozen without breaking. The sambar that came with it tasted like Campbell's Tomato Soup. The aloo (potatoes) in the aloo gobi tasted as if from a can (can you sense a trend yet?), there wasn't much gobi (cauliflower) and the dish lacked spice and complexity. Although the texture was ok, he flavor of the Baingan Bharta was completely overwhelmed with mustard (I realized that I had noticed this with my previous take out/delivery too - so I think it's the recipe, not a fluke). The rice was basic fluffy white rice, with literally a few cumin seeds in it but nothing else of note. Nothing was garnished with cilantro/coriander leaves, no cardamom pods were found. The naan was the worst I've ever had, and like many components of the meal, contained the essence of the package it emerged from, kinda like frozen pizza dough, nothing much like fluffy, bubbly homemade naan, ok, the shape was about right, albeit too perfect. It also had regular butter (which I dislike and do not eat) on it instead of ghee (which I will tolerate). They were somehow out of garlic naan (Giant Eagle must have been out. of. garlic. naan).   The only reason I would go back would be to see if the fish is STILL on the bench."}
{"text":"I just returned from having lunch here with a group of several friends.  One of my friends suggested Coriander, so given that I'm always down for Indian buffet for lunch and that I hadn't tried it before, I decided to try it out with them.  Unfortunately, the value and quality of the buffet were lacking in comparison to other Indian buffets I've tried around town.  The buffet consisted of the usual array of options, of which I sampled the following: chicken tikka masala, mango chicken, tandoori chicken, samosas, saag paneer, chick peas, rice, and naan.  If I were to use one word to describe all of them, it would be flavorless.  Most of them lacked any spice whatsoever, which was disappointing given that I enjoy Indian cuisine for its complexity in flavor, much of which is contributed by spices.  The one exception was the samosa, which I found unusually overseasoned, yet still inexplicably lacking in flavor.  In terms of temperature, all of the food was at room temperature, except for the gulab jamun, oddly--which is one of the few items that should be served at room temperature.  Given that I was underwhelmed with the quality of the buffet, I only took one plate of food.  When I went to pay, the price ($11.75) came as a bit of a shock, given that Prince of India in Oakland offers a comparable quality lunch buffet for $10 ($9 w/ ID discount).  While I feel kind of bad writing a negative review given that Coriander has sentimental value for my friend who suggested it, it just doesn't measure up to the quality of several Indian restaurants in Oakland alone, let alone the rest of PGH.  2.5 stars."}
{"text":"I got the saag paneer. It was okay, but definitely not the best I've ever had. The spices seemed a bit off. But the service was great and the staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"I got the veggie biryani with extra raita, coconut chutney, and garlic naan.   I hate when I order extra raita and I get one container of it. I know biryani comes with raita so I should be getting 2 containers, even if that means one is a small one that comes with the biryani. Alas I got the 1 container, only. That being said, the raita was fine. It was REALLY chunky compared to most restaurant's raita. But the flavor was fine.   The biryani was also just fine. I didn't get to pick a spice level when I ordered through uber eats, which always worries me because places tend to make things more on the mild side if you don't specify. This was nice and spicy though. The flavor was good, but my issue was with texture. It was really mushy. I'm not sure if they didn't use the right rice or if it was just overcooked. It also had a layer of just straight mush on top that I'm not sure what it even was. It also didn't have any of those fried onions I was so looking forward to... unless that was the mush on top.   The garlic naan was the low point. The foil when I unwrapped it was neon green. It looked to be some sort of herb oil, maybe. Whatever it was made my naan pretty soggy in the middle. The taste was really lacking garlic. Maybe I got the wrong kind of naan. I won't say I hated it, but it was definitely disappointing.   Finally the coconut chutney. It was good. Very sweet. None of the kick I expected since it said it was made with chillies. I didn't eat a lot of it because it didn't really go with anything, but I'd definitely experiment with it, again."}
{"text":"My wife and to have been to Coriander multiple times, and it's been great every time. Very reasonably priced with specials going on frequently. There is also a Sunday buffet that's delicious. I recently had a dinner party and had them cater the event. Again, their prices were amazing for naan, samosas, a large container of rice and large serving containers of 3 Indian dishes. It fed 20-25 people easily and everyone had such great things to say about the food. I would absolutely use Coriander again for a large event in the future. When setting up the catering order, the owner could tell that I had just come from work and offered me dinner that evening. It was overall such a great experience, great food, and I could not recommend them more. Just great! 5 stars easy."}
{"text":"Really good chicken tikka masala !!! Also the goan delicacies are wonderful. The buffet isnt that great howevr...a la carte is the way to go"}
{"text":"I recently tried their lunch buffet, so my review is going to be specific to that.   The options for the buffet were not many- still satisfactory for your basic Indian food cravings.   I really liked how they kept the food well-heated and they check the food trays very often to add more items.  The overall quality of the food is good. I will definitely  give it a visit back sometime soon!"}
{"text":"Coriander is very good Indian food.   The portions are fair, and the flavors are excellent.   The prices are fair as well.   We had the chicken tikka masala, chicken madrasa and matar paneer.   The chicken madrasa was good but the least flavorful.   The tikka masala was excellent and nice and creamy.   The matar paneer was fantastic with excellent excellent paneer.   Finally I had a salty lassi to drink, which, while small, was good as well."}
{"text":"Coriander is not a horrible option but it's not by far Pittsburgh's best. Indian food is not meant to be overall greasy. I also dislike the fact that their sambar is more like an overcooked can of tomatoes than actual delicious sambar. They have a buffet even for dinner which I guess can be appealing."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service, very very less quantity for whay you pay for.  They just don't want you there. Very rude people!"}
{"text":"The best Indian food I have had outside of the Bay Area. I seriously love the flavors, spices, and aromas that come from the delicious foods here. I use to order delivery from this place, however, the site I usually use does not have this place listed online anymore."}
{"text":"I definitely consider this the best Indian food on Pittsburgh. I don't think it's current star rating on yelp is accurate. Maybe it's a matter of preference, but People's Indian on penn Ave has much better ratings and I truly believe it's some of the worst Indian I've ever had. I couldn't even eat most of it. Anyway, coriander is much better and I strongly suggest it. Their chicken vindaloo and Chana masala are my favorites, but everything I've had there is honestly very good. The veg samosa are some of the best I've ever had. I strongly suggest giving it a try!"}
{"text":"I've been here many times and been very happy with the food, but we recently had the restaurant provide food for a party at our house for about 25 people and they did an OUTSTANDING job. They brought four curries with delicious rice, several types of nan, a mixed pickle they make themselves, tamarind sauce, samosas and pakoras. We were worried whether people would eat all the food, but nearly everyone lined up for seconds.  The service was great. They brought the food on time in very nice chafing dishes with sterno and they picked everything up the next day from in front of our house.   We'll do this again."}
{"text":"it's my fourth time here. I love the dinner buffet. it's only 10.95each person, which is much more cheaper than the other two times's order on menu. I love the curry with the bread."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick carry out lunch; figuring buffet would be a good route. I received a single styrofoam container - nothing for soup or salad if I wanted either. Then again, I didn't ask. $8.55.   Lunch buffet was relatively limited considering the pages or offerings they have for order. Chicken Tikka Masala, Chana Masala, Palak Paneer, spicy cabbage (sorry, don't know the formal name on that one), Tandoori Chicken, a beef dish, and naan. Oh, rice. Obviously. There were two soups and a small spice/salad bar also with your standards - cucumber salad, mint sauce, pepper sauce etc.   Frankly, it just wasn't the best Indian I've had. It was good; but chicken was a little tough in the tikka masala; the naan was pretty average, and the spicy cabbage was REALLY spicy.   I promise to return and try a la carte, because the menu is simply so gargantuan I couldn't imagine limiting my judgement to just the lunch buffet.   Side note - they do have a pretty cool, long bar with full service and a couple tv's. I could see getting crazy here with a dinner buffet and a few drafts ..."}
{"text":"4 1/2 stars for my new favorite Indian restaurant in Pittsburgh.  Had a CBS Daily deal for this place, so took the boyfriend out to dinner on a Monday night.  The menu is impressive, especially for us vegetarians.  I ordered the Tandoori Vegetables and he got the Paneer Kadai.  We skipped the appetizers but got 2 orders of garlic naan...one would have definitely been enough for the two of us.   The portions were good, the prices were reasonable, and the food....was delicious.  I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Stopped here today for the lunch buffet. You certainly can't beat the price (7.99) and the food was decent. Not awesome, but decent. Service was prompt. We'll probably come again."}
{"text":"I love the variety of Northern and Southern Indian food here and while you might question the quality of the range that they offer...so do I. I'm still wondering if I like it.   The Chicken Tikka Masala was a bit dry which offered a small dish of some floating chicken cubes.  I was expecting a larger portion for the price that was attached to it, but it failed to match my expectations. Too demanding? I think not.   Once I saw that they had dosas I knew I had to have one. I got the Kheema Dosa and expected something very different than what came. It was rolled in this long tube that didn't even fit on the plate where only the middle part of the tube of dosa was filled. I don't know how long it sat in it's own grease but it was a while, the whole bottom of the dosa was soaked.  Still, it was a dosa, so I ate it.   I would still go here though, for the dosas. FOR THE DOSAS."}
{"text":"Food was tastey, but portions were a bit smaller than other places we've been to in the same price range. We had a big party and the waitress was very flexible with splitting up the checks and getting us everything we needed, though. Customer service was great! If you're in the area and want Indian food, I'd recommend checking them out!"}
{"text":"Came back for dinner on a Sunday night - the place was WAY less crowded then it was when we first visited.  Could be that it was not a popular day to go out to eat, or that the excitement of the grand opening has died down, or it could be that we came during the Steelers/Jets playoff game and everyone was at a bar somewhere.  Whichever.  It was quieter, in a good way.  They have a full bar now, and the TVs were playing the game, not Bollywood movies.  We got the buffet, which I think was about $10.  They had a pretty good selection of things - several vegetarian offerings (aloo gobi, chana masala, potatoes in spinach, paneer in tomato sauce), and chicken tikka masala, tandoor chicken, goat biryani, spicy chicken wings, and various other things.  Also two soups, a little salad area, a handful of condiments/chutneys, and a few sweet dessert-ish things.  And naan.  Everything was pretty good - on the lukewarm side, as per usual for a buffet, but I appreciated the wide variety of options.  It was a good deal for the price.  Still, I think the quality (and temperature) of the food is higher when you order off the menu.  Nothing wowed me enough to bump them up to a four-star review.  it was standard Indian buffet fare - tasty, well-priced, all the usual suspects.  But next time I want to get the more creative and spicy options that aren't on the buffet line!"}
{"text":"The food was just okay.  Some items had good flavor, but some didn't.  The last time I ordered from there was the very last...  The simosas were really greasy, obviously fried at the wrong temperature.  And, even worse, my vegetable curry had a maraschino cherry in it.  Not sure how that happened, but it made me wonder what else could have slipped into my food.  Yikes!"}
{"text":"We came here looking at 3 star rating and no expectations. We ordered both vegetarian and non veg starters, tandoori rotis, chicken curry, malai kofta and mango lassi. Everything was really good. 3 stars for the ambience. But food was one of the best here in Pittsburgh. I would definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"**disclaimer: this review is only for the lunch buffet.  OVERALL: mediocre Indian food. The only thing I genuinely enjoyed was the naan, which was crisp and buttery. The cauliflower was also decent. Besides that, the food and service was very lackluster. We also found a hair in our food.   I came here at the recommendation of one of my friends, who said that the food here was pretty good. However, after we started eating, she regretted her choice and said that the quality of the buffet was definitely different than the regular menu.   The buffet has a variety of options, but as mentioned previously, the only thing I enjoyed was the naan. The chicken curry I got was very dry and the meat was tough. The flavor was not great, and the chicken was just too stringy. I ended up ditching the chicken altogether and ate about 5 pieces of naan, which was pretty good if you dipped it in the curry. After being thoroughly disappointed with the chicken, I found a bit of redemption with the vegetables. The cauliflower and potato dish was good, but also nothing special.  I would probably not come here again, unless I was really craving unlimited naan."}
{"text":"I often find myself here for their lunch buffet.  I feel the prices are very reasonable and the food to be excellent.  The staff are really nice as well.   This place is located where Schlotsys deli used t be."}
{"text":"I forgot to check in, but I had a nice lunch here.  This was my husband's second time at the buffet and my first.  He said it was pretty much the same both times, if not identical.  It's not the fanciest or largest Indian buffet, but I feel like there's no need for more.  I will go down the buffet and tell you how things were.  The buffet started with three chicken dishes: tandoori, tikka, and curry.  The tandoori did not look appealing as it looked overcooked/dried out.  I tried the tikka and curry and found both to be medium in quality.  The sauces were good but about 2/3 of the chicken was too dry.  Then came a tray of fried yummies.  There were vegetable samosas and some small fried things that I could not identify, before, during, or after eating them.  The little thingies were too salty.  The samosas were crisp on the outside, well stuffed on the inside.  I enjoyed the sauces from the end of the buffet with them.  Next were four vegetarian entree options: chick peas, lentils, spinach paneer, and a mixed vegetable dish.  Of the four, the lentils were the surprise hit for me, with a pleasing texture and flavor.  I also loved the veggies and could have eaten them all day long.  At the end of the first buffet table was a tray of gulab jamun, which is what I chose for dessert.  They are like dense donut balls that are fried and then soaked in syrup.  They were excellent.  They had a complex flavor and the texture wound up working well.   There was also naan, which was your standard naan.  On the next table there was watermelon, which I forgot to eat.  Then rice pudding, which is my husband's other love, and he enjoyed his little bowl of it.  Then there was a tray with slices of raw tomato, cucumber, and onions.  Finally there was an area with smaller containers of chutney, the green sauce, the brown sauce, raita, and maybe something else.   Sorry folks, I have never learned what the green and brown sauces are actually called, but these were excellent versions.  At first I was stumped because there are no little cups to put it in, (and there's a sign that says if you use the little bowls for anything other than dessert, they will charge you extra!) but I solved my first world problem with putting little piles of the tomato, cucumber, and onion on a plate.  Then I put the sauces in between those, in a fan pattern, and it mostly kept it separate.  This mostly worked because the sauces were thick.  The raita was packed with veggies but the chutney was too salty and we could not eat it.  Overall, our lunch at Coriander fulfilled our expectations and we left happy."}
{"text":"Since my first visit, I have been back at least 7 or 8 more times.  I have even taken my parents here.  It is now my favorite restaurant.  And I have yet to find one complaint.    And the annoying lengthy menu that I talked about before, its actually not that annoying.  Its almost like a treasure map.  Each item takes you to a delicious booty.    Oh ya, the buffet is pretty sweet too.  Some people have given it bad remarks but its a buffett.  And a reasonably priced one.  If you cant decide what you want from the menu, getting the buffet allows you to try out about 15 different items.  Cant go wrong.  But you definitely shouldnt base your final decision on this place from the buffet alone.  Its a nice feature to have, but the menu is where its at."}
{"text":"Not only is the food really great, but they have a party room that they rent out that is a really great price with its own entrance.  I must have been the worst party room tenant ever because I forgot to confirm the rental.  They came through at the very last minute making things perfect for us.  I also really love that they now have thali for lunch, and it is available for to go, and only $10."}
{"text":"Indian food always delights but Coriander India Grill always disappoints.  On a recent order they got both meals wrong and when I called to complain they said it was my responsibility to check on order accuracy.  The staff are unhelpful and rude.  The dining room is dingy and dark and the staff is very unpleasant."}
{"text":"Nice buffet with a nice variety, not too much of their food contains meat, which is good for me. It's a quiet place & I went around noon, not many people there. Service was fine, our drinks were filled every time we needed & did not need to ask for any extra service. Buffet is $10 so it's a decent price for so much food."}
{"text":"Pretty good food.  I ordered out, Chicken Kadai.    A bit spicy even though I asked for mild, but not too bad.  Flavor was delicious!    I'll be back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Indian Restaurant and buffet. Service if great and the buffet is so good. Food is also very fresh"}
{"text":"Coriander's three star average rating is abundantly fair.  The food was all very good, but nothing really stood out from the crowd.  This is a solid restaurant with friendly waitstaff; I just wasn't blown away by anything.  Also, the seating layout toward the front of the restaurant is odd - too much open space and not enough tables."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. I've been going about once every 2-3 weeks since they've opened. We always go for the buffet, which has had a few misses in terms of the freshness... but if you go right when they open for lunch (11, I think?) you are in for a TREAT.   The servers are super attentive and are always inquiring about your satisfaction.. to the point where it gets almost annoying.   And how can you beat eating delicious food and watching ridiculously entertaining Indian music videos. I always step out the doors with a huge grin on my face and a full, happy belly."}
{"text":"When I eat Indian food, I like to eat at a buffet so I can try new things and have a little bit of it all. On the grand scale of Indian buffets, this one was ok. Not too much variety, but of what they had to offer, it was all delicious and well spiced. We went for lunch this past Sunday and there were probably about 3 other tables partaking in the buffet as well. I had palak paneer, aloo gobi, chicken tikka masala, samosa, naan and gulab jamun for dessert. There's also a cold bar with chutneys and salad and fruit, but I don't bother with those fillers when I'm being treated to Indian food. As an aside, my friend and I both noticed the mural on the wall. It was really neat. Finally, I had found a coupon for Coriander in a CityPaper ad for $3 off two buffets, which brought our bill to about $20."}
{"text":"I cannot speak for others experiences here only my own. I Stopped in here on a whim because the Vietnamese place I had wanted to try on my birthday was closed.  On a snowy feb night past nine I had the mutton masala...the flavor, spice level and tenderness of the meat swept me off my feet. I also had chaat and a fried donut. Both delicious.   My boyfriend who loves Indian food and is vegetarian loved his paneer. It was actually spicey enough for his standards which is hard to do!  The service may have been a bit lackluster but the restaurant was clean and food was lovely."}
{"text":"My group had a terrible experience here. Our server took our drink orders and then never reappeared. We had to stand up and ask another staff person (who seemed really confused about everything) where our drinks were, and we were halfway through our dinner before the server finally reappeared with them. (One person ordered from the menu, and even the food came out before the drinks).   The food was not great, not horrible. The rice had definitely been under the heat lamp way too long because it was crunchy. The naan was all dried out too. We asked for new rice and were told \"we will put more out when we get to it\" and when they did, they just dumped it right in with the crunchy dried up rice.   The worst part, and the reason for the one star, is that one of our group bit down on some kind of soap or cleaning agent in the food. He actually had to run to the bathroom and spit it out. He said it was chemical tasting and kind of fizzed when he bit on it. (We have eaten enough Indian food to know that this wasn't star anise or some kind of spice, it was something chemical).   We will not be back."}
{"text":"EPIC FAILURE! I am BOYCOTTING Coriander India Grill for life! I used to be a huge fan (See my previous review), but I had a horrible experience there on Christmas Day 2012, which has TURNED ME OFF FOR LIFE!   I'm an event planner for Meetup.com. In 2012, I planned a Holiday Dinner at Coriander India Grill for December 25, 2012. I CALLED & CONFIRMED a reservation with the owner 3 weeks in advance, and had his assurance that his kitchen could handle taking individual dinner orders and writing separate checks for an estimated group of 20 people. I even asked if he would have enough kitchen and wait staff to handle our group and was ASSURED that they would be well-staffed, and it wouldn't be a problem.  On Dec. 25, 2012, 18 people from Meetup attended the All-Holidays Dinner at Coriander. Soon after my arrival, I got into a 10-minute heated debate with one of the waiters, as I tried to confirm that each person would receive a separate check. The owner/manager, Victor, had COMPLETELY FAILED to communicate this information to his wait staff, and the waiter was refusing (at first) to write separate checks. THIS IS A DEAL BREAKER FOR ME AS AN EVENT PLANNER! It's a nightmare to try and split a check with 18 people!   It took a while, but the waiter finally agreed to my request--after I asked to speak to the owner. But, I SHOULD NOT HAVE NEEDED TO DEBATE this in the first place--when the owner had confirmed with me over the phone 3 weeks earlier that this would not be a problem! That argument took time away from my friends, and away from my enjoyment of this event.  After that issue was resolved, and we had all ordered our food, one of my members got up, put on his coat, and started to leave--before his food had even arrived! I asked him why he was leaving so soon, and he informed me that his WATER GLASS HAD LIPSTICK ON THE RIM, and he had to ask for a new glass! Then, when he took his silverware out of his napkin, THE NAPKIN HAD LIPSTICK ON IT, TOO! And, the butter knife was dirty. This person had planned on enjoying a meal with friends, but was so disgusted that he got up and left. I was horrified, and now embarrassed that I had even recommended this restaurant. I apologized to the group and convinced them to stay! (We had already ordered, and where else could we go--last minute--on Christmas Day?)  I'm still not sure how someone FAILS to notice lipstick on the rim of a water glass while setting a table. It was not that dark in the restaurant.   After that person left, things got even worse!!!  I don't know if it the staff was intentionally punishing us for \"daring\" to ask for separate checks or complaining about lipstick on a glass and napkin. I don't know if the owner had deceived me on the phone weeks earlier when he assured me there would be enough kitchen staff to accommodate our group. What I DO KNOW IS THAT IT TOOK OVER 90 MINUTES TO GET OUR FOOD!!! I suspect this was a PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE MOVE on their part meant to punish us--because--many people who got seated AFTER US at nearby tables, got served their food BEFORE US!  The final insult for me came when I spoke to the owner/manager, Victor, at the end of the night, and he REFUSED TO APOLOGIZE for anything! I can understand having a bad night. We're all human. But, apparently the words, \"I'm sorry\" don't exist in his vocabulary. He was completely UNAPOLOGETIC. He acted like these things were perfectly normal and acceptable, and there was no apology whatsoever, and no assurance that these things wouldn't happen again.   It was his attitude, as much as the problems, which made me decide to never set food inside that restaurant ever again Lipstick on a glass of water and napkin is NOT NORMAL! Failing to convey important information to your staff after CONFIRMING SEPARATE CHECKS with a customer by phone is unacceptable. And not apologizing for your mistakes is also UNACCEPTABLE.  Also worth noting:  the restaurant was not that busy when our group first arrived, and only about half the tables were full at that point. Victor used the excuse that they were very busy that night, and that it's \"normal\" to wait 90 minutes for food to be served in a busy restaurant. I disagree. That was one of the longest waits for dinner I have EVER experienced in my LIFE! And, I had specifically asked him if it would be a problem--if he would have enough kitchen staff to handle it--and he had assured me it would not be a problem. Obviously, he was wrong.  What a TERRIBLE WAY to run a business when you alienate one of your very best customers who happens to be the MAIN ORGANIZER of a Dining Group! His refusal to apologize when clearly he and his staff made a SERIES of mistakes was infuriating! I have brought many people there in the past, but after this TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE, I will never return, and I will be telling my friends the story of their EPIC FAILURE and BAD SERVICE for years to come."}
{"text":"I am definitely a fan of Indian food, and I've had a lot of it, from vegetarian South Indian in a cinderblock no-frills shack, to the neon palace kitschy restaurants.  I have great, I've had lame, and I've even had WTF.  I wanted to try the Indian restaurant that would dare to inhabit what had been for like a thousand years a Jewish Deli mainstay that didn't stay.  So before heading to the Regent Square Theatre (my favorite film house in this burgh - see the other review), a friend and I decided to give Coriander a try.  I'm not going to say it's one of my faves foodwise, but I will definitely go back given the opportunity.  The food is kind of basic, not fast food, but not mind-blowing.  But the atmosphere, the service, the prices, and the comfort level at Coriander is darned nice enough to make return trips.  We ordered the Coriander platter for appetizers.  It was tasty, but my one suggestion would be 'think two'.  I don't know many people who order an appetizer 'platter' just for themselves, and cutting everything in half for sharing is kind of a pain.  The samosa was good, but again, not awesome. The pakora was good, and at least did have a few pieces, instead of just one. There was one aloo tikki, again, two would have been nice on a platter for two, and the rest of the items were interesting (can't say exactly what they were by name), but again, all had to be split to share.  The green chutney sauce was VERY good to topping them all.  For dinner, I ordered one of my top faves, palak paneer, and my friend ordered the butter chicken, and we both ordered a nan, mine was garlic, his was plain.  To start off, I do have to rave about the garlic nan.  I could have made a whole meal out of that, breath be damned.  It was buttery and garlicy and absolute yum.  I tasted my friend's butter chicken, which was tasty, again, it was adequate, not spectacular.  My palak paneer seemed a little odd, but it taste good.  The spinach had been pureed to the point that it was a green cream, with no real resemblance to real spinach aside from the color.  The taste was fine, but an odd texture from what I'm familiar with.  I do have to say the portion for dinner seemed a little small, but as I mentioned, it wasn't expensive, and the bottom line was that it filled me up.  The basmati rice was perfect.  The waiter was adorable and as sweet as could be, and the co-waitress was also very nice.  And having B4U on the TV with all of the Bollywood music videos was great too.    There was a nice calm crowd, of the more intellectual variety, as well as a nice ethnic mix, which is always a nice change in any restaurant in da burgh, and just generally speaking a very comfortable evening meal spot.  There may be some better food out there, but if you're looking for decent Indian and are in Squirrel Hill, don't rule it out.  It's actually incredibly pleasant.  And...ta da!  They're COKE people...always a plus in my book!  The full bill with tip came to about $40. Not bad for two, with appetizers, two entrees, incredible nan, and a drink.  I'll go back. Now if I could just time it for the Ranbir Kapoor videos on B4U..."}
{"text":"I wasn't crazy about this place... After trying Indian food for the first time, I was hellbent on finding an Indian restaurant closer to my home. It is within walking distance, and located near other restaurants on Murray in Squirrel Hill. The website states that they open at 11:00AM for lunch Mon-Sat, but there's a handwritten sign on the door that states they open at 11:30AM. After killing some time, I came back around 11:45AM. The restaurant's atmosphere is nice, and I like that they play Bollywood movies. The buffet wasn't fully setup yet, but I just couldn't wait to eat any longer. I went to ask a worker there for a \"to go\" container for the buffet. He handed it to me, and advised me to come back to the front once I got the food. I went to the buffet, and the food looked good. I chose the chicken tikka masala, rice, and a couple other veggie sides. I went to pay for the food, and the man that told me to come back to the front was behind the bar. He rang me up, and I paid... Another worker came out and greeted me. He asked the other worker if he offered me naan(which wasn't at the buffet at the time) and a bag... which he didn't until he was asked... Worker 1 bagged the food, and came out a few minutes later with the naan. When I finally got home to eat I was very disappointed... The food was extremely bland... It wasn't horrible, but I had to improvise on the taste with things I have at my home. The chicken tikka masala was watery, and the chicken was tough. It didn't even look like white meat... I probably won't be going back. Worker 2 was very nice, but worker 1 needed an attitude adjustment... Also, if they don't open until 11:30AM, they should have that on the website, and they should have everything ready when they open..."}
{"text":"Coriander is part of a mini boom of new restaurants that replaced old ones on Murray Ave. This includes Sababa Grill and Green Pepper. The people are great and the buffet is okay, but the best part is when they pass out just baked bread (not quite naan) to your table when it's flaky and hot. In a couple minutes it will get tough and stale, but when it's fresh it gives this place 4 stars.  I think what's lacking is strong flavor. It might have been that I hadn't slept for several days and my nerves were numb or other people agree with me on this. I may have to come back to confirm my observations. Another 'like' for Coriander is that it is the only place to get your Indian food fix in squirrel hill."}
{"text":"Had lunch buffet and was really disappointed. The appetizers were okay, the rest of the food was so bland and cold. Several containers were empty and not being refilled. Do not recommend at all."}
{"text":"Came here for the lunch buffet and it was delicious! Samosas are always my favorite and these had the right spice level. The buffet offers so many different options from rice, naan, Chana masala, tikka masala, chicken curry to name a few. The buffet from mon-thurs is about $10 a person. The service was okay. It took some time for our water to be refilled. But overall I'm definitely full and satisfied."}
{"text":"I never write reviews but this place deserves one. I've tried various items on their VAST menu and everything is delicious. And I've tried a lot of Indian food. The naan is soft and doughy and delicious, and all of the typical basic Indian food is WELL above par. I've never had an unsatisfying meal from Coriander.  I also have to mention how amazing the owners are. I've been a loyal customer for years and everyone has given me great service every time I've eaten in or gotten takeout. Sometimes the owner throws in free appetizers in my takeout, or extra naan. It's the best service I've ever had, and they definitely deserve to be noticed for it!"}
{"text":"It has been a personal goal of mine to hit every Indian buffet Pittsburgh has to offer, and Coriander was next up on the list. First off, the interior and decor definitely lack appeal and gave off a semi-depressing atmosphere to me. The service quality was average. Our waitress fulfilled the minimum requirements without much conversation and let us do our own thing which was fine with me.   The buffet size and variety is limited. It has the basic Indian buffet items (Chicken Tikka Masala, Palak Paneer, Samosas, etc.) but nothing special beyond that. They offered only one dessert option (Gulab Jamun) and watermelon aside from the hot entrees and salad. The staff would wait until the last possible second to refill empty trays with a fresh batch. I was chomping on the last dry bits of rice before more came out - yes, I was that hungry! Most of the buffet items are vegetarian, so I had no issues with having enough to eat; although, a lot of the options were very greasy, even more than usual for Indian food. Aside from a few bumps, the overall quality was on par with its competitors. Coriander failed to stand out to me in a good way, and for about $12 for a dinner buffet, I would rather dine at All India and Taj Mahal for a wider selection at similar quality and price. Off to the next Indian buffet!"}
{"text":"Coriander is hit or miss for me. I actually think they might have different chefs, or they have changed chefs a few times, because I've ordered Chicken Vindaloo three times and received thee very different dishes. I do enjoy their appetizers, like the samosas and pakoras. Their biryani and dosas are typically good too."}
{"text":"Ordered chilly gobi and it was tasting bad. When gave feedback about that ,they got offended to a point that they said \"you cannot say that\". Rest of the food was average compared to other Indian restaurants in the city."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Had the Matar Paneer and Chicken Tikka. Both equally good! Friendly service. They have both northern and southern region foods. I will definitely be back! (AND A BAR)"}
{"text":"I'm sure their dinner entrees are wonderful, but it's hard to pass up their Sunday all-you-can-eat lunch buffet with endless chaat, naan, chana masala and chicken tandori (among other Indian hits). The samosas are large, curry filled goodness and the pakoras are crisped to perfection. The vegetarian and carnivore can peacefully coexist and dine the afternoon away to be unhealthily full upon departure. There's a dessert section, but if you buffet'd well you will be hard pressed to partake. Ambiance is par for the course for a casual Indian eatery. We can't speak for regular lunch or dinner service, but staff has been attentive every time we've gone for the bountiful buffet. Just get there on a Sunday and eat your heart out!"}
{"text":"Coriander is one of the better Indian restaurants in the area with a consistent food quality, everytime you order. I love their chicken biriyani and their Goan dishes. Service is pretty good, I never had a bad experience with them. If you are around the squirrel hill area and are craving Indian food I would definitely recommend trying out Coriander."}
{"text":"Disappointed for multiple reasons. Food was not authentic Indian at all and had a lot of artificial food color added. Besides the lack of variety and quality of food, customer service is a myth in this restaurant. And is was our bad luck that the restaurateur was there that day. Here are few snippets on what happened on my first visit:-  Scene 1:- Me - We are 3 of us, I think we will sit here (the center table). Restaurateur - If you sit here you gotta pay for 6 as it has 6 chairs (LOL). You should sit there. Me - But there are 4 chairs there. Does that mean we have to pay for 4? Restaurateur - I'll remove one chair so that you don't have to pay for the 4th (And he actually did so, ridiculous)  Scene 2:- Me - Can I get a spoon. Restaurateur - All the spoons are there in the counter buddy (And waled away)  Scene 3:- Me - (I took the plate with me for a second serving unmindfully, students you see :-P) Restaurateur - You don't follow buffet etiquette, do you? You need to take fresh plates if you are taking food. (This was too much) Me - Sorry, I have not been to buffet's where I do not enjoy. This' my first time.  In fact, I was new to the rude nature of a restaurant manager along with bad food. And then, the bill was thrown at us much before we were even done eating.  Except for the helpful waiters, nothing is worth the $11 heavy price. Avoid this place. There are plenty of other options available nearby."}
