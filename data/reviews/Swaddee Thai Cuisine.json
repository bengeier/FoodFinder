{"text":"The food here is always very fresh and tasty. The prices are not the cheapest but it is worth it. Always friendly staff. So far my favorite Thai place in the east valley."}
{"text":"Very very unhappy with the service. The food was so-so. We went for lunch at a very busy time. No one greeted us for about 10 minutes. Then we were seated, menus set down and waitstaff walked away still without saying anything. We ordered drinks and actually got them within a decent amount of time. Several people were also sitting with no food. Uh oh, not a good sign. We ordered the Lunch specials which we assumed would be quick. NOT. We never got our salads and after 40 minutes, asked for our order to go which totally confused everyone at the counter. We still got charged for the drinks we abandoned and the missing salads. No apologies either.

As for the food, the Yellow Curry Chicken was ok, nothing to special, actually a little too sweet. The Red Curry Beef was pretty bad. There wasn't nearly enough meat but that's probably a good thing since it was as chewy as \"an old truck bench seat cover\" according to my husband. The egg roll was the size of a my pinky finger and was a joke.

All of the Best Of reviews appear to be from awhile time ago...  Doesn't matter, I'm not going back."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai restaurant since my coworker introduced it to me as her favorite. My favorite is pad sew iu. The lunch menu price is great, even after they raised it once. The Thai ice tea is awesome. I also love their panang. I've taken so many of my friends there and they all loved it. The service is great too. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place is really good during lunch on the weekdays.But always something else on weekends. This time they are not making the appetizers. Bummer, But the food is still good.

I had to take off a star for the following reason... our server had moved the hot sauces to make room for the food. When we got up to leave we noticed chili sauce on my 2year old's cap. I asked them to wash it. She told the other girl that my boy did it. My wife got up and told them my son was across the table in a high chair. What kind of person blames a little kid?? We just took the hat and paid the bill. They did not even offer something off the bill for staining my son's hat. Sad very sad."}
{"text":"This has been our favorite Thai restaurant for many years. We try others but nothing compares. Their Tom Kah soup is excellent. Their Phad Thai is the best. We always feel like it was  money well spent when we leave Swaddee. Please give it a try - I hope you will love it too!"}
{"text":"I've had thai food at a few other places in the valley and this place is by far my favorite. I went with a few friends a couple weeks ago and all of our meals were great!"}
{"text":"I've eaten a lot of Asian food in my time, having traveled abroad extensively and having lived in California, but I don't think I have come across better Thai food. The green and red curries are delectable and can be made as mild or as spicy as your palate (and non-asbestos coated tongue) can handle. 1 is mild, 2 is considered medium, and 5 is Three-Mile Island hot (don't do this if you truly like yourself or even just marginally like yourself). 

If you do decide to go, the evenings are not quite as busy as lunchtime. If you choose to try Swaddee during your lunch hour, then I highly suggest that you get there as soon as it opens for lunch, because Intel is right next door and many employees opt to eat at Swaddee. 

Also, if you plan on bringing kids with you to the restaurant, then be careful which tables you sit at because some have piccies of scantily-clad (some nekked) ladies. I was forced to strategically place some condiments over one of the said scantily-clad ladies in a bit of a hurry just  recently."}
{"text":"When I think of Thai food, I think of Swadee. Swadee was sort of my introductory restaurant into the world of Thai food. I've gone with many friends and family her over the years and they all have been satisfied.

So it pains me to write a bad review, but the last couple experiences I've had at Swadee have required me to bid Swadee adieu.

The first bad experience I ordered the Larb Tofu. The dish was so salty I couldn't finish it. It literally tasted like the cap fell off the soy sauce bottle and they dumped  several cups of the stuff in the pan/wok. Even if they didn't, it was pretty much inedible. Inedible in the same way a salad swimming in vinaigrette is.

The second occurred during a visit with my girlfriend. We are both vegetarians and took great care to make sure that the dishes we ordered were meat (and fish sauce, and chicken broth) free. Those ingredients can upset a vegetarian's stomach if it's been a while since they ate meat (or if they've never eaten it). 

Well, my girlfriend ordered the pad thai (carefully made veg) and she found a piece of chicken in her dish. To most this would not be a big deal, but to us chicken isn't considered food and it taints the food it was cooked with. As a result she lost her appetite and it made me feel uneasy about what might be in my own meal. Our lovely Valentine's Day dinner came to a screeching halt.

And as a side note they have a dish with oyster sauce listed on their vegetarian menu. Since when is an oyster a vegetable? The only vegetarian oyster is an oyster mushroom!

I understand that there is always a risk for cross contamination and I expect it when I dine out. But this occurance is far more than just cross contamination. I mean, this thing was a pretty decent sized chunk of bird. It makes me feel uneasy about the level of cross contamination that takes place in Swadee's kitchen. 

The staff was kind enough to comp the tainted Pad Thai (which accounts for the ** instead of *) but I don't believe you'll see me walking into Swadee any time in the foreseeable future."}
{"text":"Our \"go to\" Thai lunch place for years... The food is always good and the service is prompt and consistent."}
{"text":"Pad se ew had alright flavor but a little on the dry side. Liked the flavor of the spicy fried rice but rice was a little hard and there were no cucumbers or tomatoes. Portion size was good though. Maybe if I had saw the cockroach review, I most likely wouldn't have come here."}
{"text":"I swung by last Saturday night to order some take-out for dinner. I used to live right by the Swaddee down on Ray Rd. which I loved so I was really happy to find one up in my new neighborhood. But I was sadly dissapointed with the quality of the food. The pad thai was mushy like it had been sitting there for hours, and 1/2 the size of the Chandler location's version. They totally skimped on the shrimp, too, leaving me with a mere three peices to savor. The Panang curry was loaded with onions and the beef was seriously chewy. 

These two items are what I always ordered down at the Chandler store, so I can tell when something's off. But beyond being \"off\", they were just poorly cooked.  I gave it two stars instead of one, though, as it couldn't be classified as a \"horrible\" experience and the people there were nice, too, so I'm obliged to give them credit.

Unfortunately, I'm now in search of a new Thai place to call my local \"fave\" :("}
{"text":"Great little Thai place. My favorite is the yellow curry with chicken! Love it so much that I ordered it two days in a row for lunch."}
{"text":"Not sure what has happened but the prices are higher and the quality is poor (stay away from the shrimp!). 

No real witty way to say it...they are off my Thai list forever. Good thing there are a plethora of uberfab places in the Chandler area!"}
{"text":"Usually thai cuisine is easily liked by diverse people.  Visited the place with great hopes, the whole group ordered the same pad thai dish that unfortunately turned up very sweet and quite different from other thai places."}
{"text":"Ordered Pad Thai with level 4 spiciness. It is not that spicy but I think it is a bit too oily for me. Pad Thai from Thai Caf√© is much better."}
{"text":"We miss the closed Scottsdale Swaddee so much that we ventured with our neighbors to the Chandler location. We were greated like old friends. They are the nicest restaurant proprietors this side of Thailand! The food is spectacularly delicious! We always have the Tom Ka soup, one with chicken and one with tofu. For 5 of us, we did have a wee bit left over to take home: We also indulged with two of the lightly battered deep fried tempura, Thai basil noodles, two sweet and two sour shrimp, and a bowl of vege in yellow curry. For five people we enjoyed a feast of the most delectible Thai food. I have been to so many Thai restaurants, but this one has the best food, and service. You must go if you are within traveliing distance!

{"text":"this place gets packed during lunch time  hours. the food is great and friendly customer service. I ordered a 3 and to me it seemed like it was a 4 or 5, it was hot but i love spicy food. the server had to keep bring me water to cool me down a notch, my forehead created a puddle on sweat on the floor it was that spicy but sooo good! 

you sure can find me back there again. 

they do have lunch specials so take advantage of it!!!"}
{"text":"I have been here for lunch several times.  Try to get in the door before 12; 11:30 if you can.  I find the service to be acceptable on most occasions, but that can slow down when the place starts packing up.  That goes the same with the food.  The food is good though.  I have tried the yellow curry and the pad thai.  Both were fresh and flavorful.  The yellow curry is one of the best I've had.  It is a good blend of spice and coconut milk.  The price is reasonable - $7 for salad, egg roll, curry and rice.  Not much to say about the decor.  The restaurant can use some sprucing up.  That doesn't bother me since I am just there for a good quick lunch.  I will definitely go back, though I am not sure if I'll put up with the wait.

Update:  Wait is way too long.  Not worth it."}
{"text":"Very fresh, good quality, tasty, and authentic Thai food. Tom kha gai, pad thai, and panang chicken were all great. Nothing was so much better than what I've had at Malee's, Thai Rama, Thai Elephant, Thai Hut, etc., but nothing was worse, either. Service was very good. Atmosphere is sort of tacky generic Asian. Overall, nothing worth making a special trip for, but a very good neighborhood Thai restaurant for those who live in this area."}
{"text":"Terrible experience in Swaddee.  I found an used bandage in the food.  So yakkk!!!  The waitress came and grabbed the dish away.  I should've take a picture about it. She apologized for the incident.  But my friends and I had to leave.  I will never go to the place again."}
{"text":"Ate there for first time,.and had the runs all night, dont think i will go back, titos revenge!!"}
{"text":"My first Thai restaurant and still my go-to place. Tom ka soup, pineapple shrimp or coconut princess with tofu (both red curries) & rice pudding dessert are so good, I'm having trouble trying other dishes! They're conservative with the heat level, so I get extra heat on the side. Small, casual, reasonably priced & the decor is a hoot: it looks like Thailand exploded in there."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch during the week -- it was very crowded.  As a result, it look a long time to get our food after we placed our order.  The food itself was pretty good.  I had the red curry with soft tofu and brown rice.  The service was very friendly and attentive despite the slowness."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today. was pretty crowded and ambience is ok .
Ordered Soup , Fried rice- both vegan and with chicken . really loved the kim toh soup and the fried rice was also good. 

check it out if you happen to be around there .. will go back again"}
{"text":"I very much enjoy Swaddee and I can't believe that people are gicing this place 1 or 2 stars!!  We go frequently and have tried the following more than once:

Pad See Iew, Pad Woon Sen (my favorite noodle dish), Coconut Princess, Thai Fried Rice (the best), Chicken Satay, and Tom Ka soup.

All are delicious!!!  The dinner price is a little high, but I think you find that anywhere.  We've never had an issue with the servers being slow.  They do tag team and I don't think they speak a ton of excellent English, which is why they are pretty quiet.  I don't mind that, as you get to eat your food in peace!  Their food is pretty spicy, so I never go over a 2 star.  You'll clean out your sinuses at a 4 or 5 star!!  

I really enjoy this place and think you ought to give it a try to decide for yourself!"}
{"text":"Swaddee is great for lunch and very affordable, I have frequented the establishment with co-workers and on numerous occasions we have done take out. While the food is nothing spectacular it has been proven to be consistent and at least above average with portion sizes (at lunch at least) that were more than adequate. The service has always been prompt and friendly as well. 

I really favor the red curry as it has a tolerable amount of heat without sacrificing flavor. I was originally surprised by the watery consistency of the curry but I warmed to the difference in light of the flavor and portion size."}
{"text":"Yum! I usually order green chicken curry, and it's always consistently good (although, I can't see how you can mess up a curry dish). I recently tried their seafood combo and the broth was so good! It's hard for me to venture away from my green curry, but I am happy I did! Heat level does seem to vary. I usually order a 2, but I have experienced my 2 dish being hotter than a 4 dish. Despite the fluctuations, the service is always lovely and the green curry is delicious. Lunch hour can get busy, but dinner is always open!"}
{"text":"Excellent - good quality ingredients, well prepared. Thai fried rice, red curry, yum. This place has been a Thai staple in Chandler for a few years. All of their dishes are very good, albeit there is some inconsistency at times on the flavor and spicy levels. Hands down. Very good and so much flavor. Try the Tom Yum soup. Too good!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Swaddee Thai for a couple of years.  It is my favorite Thai restaurant.  I had lunch there this past weekend, and after not having there for a couple of months, it reminded me why I like the food so much.  The truth is that I usually stick to three of me favorite dishes every time I go.  I usually get my food pretty spicy, a 4 from a range of one to five.  The vegetarian options are excellent, as most Thai restaurants can prepare most dishes as vegetarian.

My favorite dish in the menu is yellow curry, which is a mix of vegetables in a curry sauce, with rice on the side.  I also really like their spicy noodles.  It may not sound as terribly adventurous, but it has lots of flavor.  It is also a dish that would go very well with most people who are new to Thai food. And my other favorite is Tom Yum soup, which is hot and sour.  I have taken several friend to this restaurant and they have not been disappointed.  And for those who are not sure about Thai food I always suggest that they start with the spicy noodles.  The noodles can be prepared with very little spice if requested that way.

For a long time, I have been telling myself that I would write a review for this restaurant. Done!"}
{"text":"I Love this place. My family gets to go orders all the time. We have never actually dined in but it is always a very pleasant wait in the dining room when I arrive early for my take-out.  I am partial to the Pad Wo Sen (transparent noodles) with chicken. I always get a 3 on the spicy scale as I made the mistake of getting a 5 once, and I like spicy food.  The rest of my family gets a 1.  The staff is always cheerful and nice."}
{"text":"I've never actually eaten in the restaurant - Swaddee is one of those places I used to pick up and take home when I lived in Chandler. So, first their take-out process: they've never botched an order, food has been ready within the time frame given each and every time, and I'm almost always in and out in a flash. The food: I've sampled various veggie and seafood options, and they've all been equally delicious. Since I've never been inside for more than a few minutes, I can't really vouch for the atmosphere or the service, but I stand by the food. A little pricier, perhaps, than the Thai Basil down the street, but totally worth it."}
{"text":"Lived in scottsdale for a long time and this is the best Thai food that I've had in Scottsdale.  The owner and staff were extremely welcoming.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Food and service is always great! I forget to do \"good\" reviews, but this place makes it worth the effort. The staff actually smiles and is glad you are there, which is getting more rare every day. Very clean, real napkins folded into little birds (I think) lol. Yummy food! I feel good after eating here! Give them a try and add a review. :-)"}
{"text":"I have been to the Swaddee in Chandler and know they do phenomenal sauces and pretty good food so, I was really looking forward to experience Swaddee in Scottsdale.  I had the exact same dish I get at their Chandler location - the red curry.  The sauce was meh, not so much.  Unfortunately the food definitely did not measure up and I think there are much better Thai places in the Valley."}
{"text":"The food is good and I have always loved going here for lunch or dinner...until the roaches crawling on the walls, the tables - EEEWW!  Click on the date for any \"complain inspection\" and you will see they find roaches here - continually!  http://www.maricopa.gov/envsvc/envwebapp/tabs/results.aspx?navigatedFrom=businessResultsDrillDown&mc_perm_id=129281&business=SWADDEE%20THAI%20CUISINE&address=5055%20%20%20W%20%20RAY%20RD&permitid=SG48994  I have stopped going here and, instead, go to Yupha's Thai which is better food and, no roaches.  Note that the Via Linda location does not have any problems and, in fact gets awarded Silver or Gold awards from the Maricopa County Inspections.  It is only the Chandler location that is a problem and should be avoided."}
{"text":"Try their soups,  they are fantastic.  The service was quick. The food was a nice change in flavor.  The price was appropriate."}
{"text":"Thai is my favorite cuisine and I've eaten it on the east coast, west coast including the Thai Temple in LA AND the famous Lotus of Siam (hailed the best Thai in US).  Swadee does not disappoint.  I stick to the noodle dishes and curries.   The curries are never too watery or too milky, just perfect.  If you ask for a spicy of 4 you will be on fire and if you like spicy like me, it's deeeeelicious.  Service is prompt and wait staff are friendly.  Lunch time is pretty much chaos with entire Intel staff taking over, but it's also the best deal (lunch specials are all under $6).  Dinner prices are on the high side, because the portions are almost identical to lunch but it is much more tame and less crowded at night.  I NEVER get dessert at asian restaurants simply because it's just not that impressive ever.  Well, MAN.......the coconut ice cream here is FANTASTIC.  I eat the entire bowl and always have to apologize for not sharing."}
{"text":"Major WIN from this girl ... I have never been a huge fan of thai food especially curry. But I had family in town and it was convenient. 

Well slap me BECAUSE it was fantastic and I will be back. 

There were four of us so we each ordered a course and it was the perfect amount! 

Chicken Hot Pot (with clear noodles) 
Pot Stickers 
Chicken yellow curry {MY FAVE}
Shrimp broccoli & noodles ... {a little sweet} 

Great atmosphere ... We sat there for almost two hours enjoying our meal and chatting. There were several other larger groups all sharing too. Seems to be a trend. 

I HIGHLY recommend!"}
{"text":"This little restaurant is in a strip mall and not very noticeable.  However, I was at my insurance agents office, and was looking for something for a late lunch.  Although it was later than a normal lunch, I thought I would see if they would still honor their luncheon specials - which they did.  I kind of caught them at a bad time, as the staff were actually eating, and I was the only one in the restaurant. But they were very pleasant, and attentive even though they were also trying to eat.

The interior is rather spartan, but tastefully decorated.  It really appears to be more directed to a lunch clientele than dinner/late night place.

I tried the green curry lunch special, and it was very good.  While I ate, I had a chance to look at the regular menu, and it was the usual Thai menu.  I did notice that it was a little more expensive than some Thai restaurants I have been to, but not so much so that it would keep me from coming back.  

The one advantage is that it is close, and if I am hungry for Thai take-out, this will be the place I go."}
{"text":"Swadee is bomb! I'm a Thai food lover and I've hopped around to a bunch of the Thai places in Ahwatukee/Chandler... This place is a great combination of authentic, quality food at a good price. They have a great lunch special for $7.95 that only goes up to $8.95 for dinner and its the perfect portion for anyone (I usually have extra left over!) 

I like spicy food and they definitely understand what spice is - I go with a level three to be safe and stick to the Pad Thai, Red Curry,  Panang Curry and Garlic Chicken. Always good, hot and fresh. Not to mention all the employees are super nice. Great spot!"}
{"text":"My mouth is even watering right now just thinking about this place! We went for dinner on a Wednesday. They have dinner specials that are a really good deal. You get a main entree, spring roll, peanut salad, and rice if it's not a noodle dish. I got transparent noodles with veggies and tofu. The salad was amazing. That peanut dressing is officially my new favorite thing in the world! Spring roll was yummy and crunchy. The noodles were very good, although could have used more noodles. All the veggies were perfectly cooked and the Tofu was perfectly fried. I can't wait to come back :)"}
{"text":"not sure what everyone else has been eating but... i think swaddee is great. food is well spiced and you can actually taste the flavors which is a big plus. The tom ka gai soup is amazing + all of the curries are flavorful and yummy. to top it all off they have pretty good lunch specials. i dont think you can go wrong if you eat here so check it out."}
{"text":"Love this place. Its the best i've found in the Phoenix area (although I actually just ordered Yupha's so we will see). The chicken pad see ew (spelling?) was amazing, and they provided a large portion. Very fast (10-15 minute wait) pickup if you are ordering to go. My friend and I, felt that the 5/5 level of spicy was the way to go, and it was waay too intense. Every bite was painfully delicious, and honestly quite frustrating. I was sweating and kinda felt like I had just taken a bongload (of bammer). I had to shower my body after that meal, but overall it was delightful. I would just recommend sticking w/ a low level of spice, and I love me some spice."}
{"text":"Try chicken noodles, its the bomb. They  have great lunch menu. Red curry, Yellow curry are great. Tom yum and Tom Ka are great . Make sure you pick 1-5 and stay within 3. its a bit packed during lunch, i wish they could turn around faster during lunch, oh well, its worth the wait. My asian colleagues who travel for short visits at least go here once and love it every time. need I say more, officially addicted to swadee!"}
{"text":"Being new to the Phoenix area we were looking forward to finding a Thai restaurant, since we eat Thai fairly often. Going off of the Yelp reviews, we decided to try Swaddee. We ordered the Tom Ka soup with tofu instead of chicken, and the Pad See-ew with soft tofu, and the veggie rolls (to go). The veggie rolls were tasty and larger than we're used to, which was a nice surprise. The Tom Ka soup was a little more sour than we're used to, but overall still tasty. However, it was almost $11 which we felt was about double what it should have cost. The Pad See-ew was the most disappointing part of the meal. The flavor was fine, nothing special but not bad. However, it was pretty dry and sticky, like you'd expect from a cheap college Thai take-out joint.

Overall nothing really stood out. We had high hopes since the meals were on the pricey end for take-out, but we've had far better Thai for half the price. We'll keep looking for a better Thai place to become our local go-to!"}
{"text":"Awful!!! Anyone that claims this is good Thai has never ate outside of Phoenix.  The place is awful.  I ordered take out of yellow curry with potatoes and chicken with fried rice which by the way was 25 bucks for one person.  25 bucks at a grocery store for one person can go a far way.

Next, it came in a container which 95% was the yellow curry liquid.  I came with 3 pieces of chicken and one potato.  This is full truth..  I even dumped the liquid out and even pieced the potato together and three pieces of chicken.  The rest was green pepper.  So bad.

Experience: Have had Thai all over the USA AND Thailand.  Yup, I got ripped off and obviously these people don't mind getting ripped of with the high reviews.   100% Truth to this review.  You've been warned."}
{"text":"I've been going to Swaddee since it opened and have never had a bad experience. The food is fresh, flavorful, and served in generous portions. The prices for lunch and dinner specials are reasonable (the only times I go, because I am still a broke college student). Lunch and dinner specials come with a spring roll and a salad, so it's a nice meal. Lunch and dinner special times can get a little crazy, often with lines going out the door, so I usually go after the peak rush times. This results in a quieter atmosphere and food delivered to the table within 10 minutes of ordering, if not quicker.

The other dishes on the menu, while tasty, are a little on the expensive side for me ($10-$12) and not in portions large enough to justify spending that much. 

Other items on the menu such as coconut ice cream and Thai iced tea also do not disappoint. The appetizers are tasty and the soups pack quite a punch in terms of flavor. 

One thing I have noticed, though, is that the spiciness scale tends to be all over the place. One time's 4 is another visit's 2 is another visit's 5. So be warned!

Basically, go there for a delicious, affordable meal at lunch or dinnertime, but try to beat the rush if you can."}
{"text":"This place is in the same complex as my nail salon but I have not stopped in to this location. I have been to their Scottsdale location and love it!

This location does not disappoint. Service is quick and while they prefer cash, the ATM is on site and they offer a discount if you pay cash so no problem. I had the Nam Sod and ordered it Thai hot and yes it was! I hate when I order \"Thai hot\" and it comes out just a little fiery. Make me sweat, people! 

The texture was lovely, it wasn't dry and the serving was huge! I easily could have shared it and ended up with two meals out of it. I will definitely make this a post-nail appointment dining spot from now on."}
{"text":"Best thai food in Phoenix! I'm from back east and it's hard to find good ethnic food in AZ unless you're looking for Mexican... After trying several places this is our go to!"}
{"text":"If you must eat Thai food and aren't looking to make an experience out of it...go for it. An OK joint, that has the standard Thai menu but nothing really on it to make you come back again. Again...nothing wrong with the place, just that I would have gone to a Taco Bell or a Panda Express instead as well."}
{"text":"I get the same thing every time.  Yellow Curry Chicken.  It's predictable and good.  Service is good.  they don't rush you out.  busy during lunch so get there early."}
{"text":"Currently my fave Thai, and I regularly go to the one in Flagstaff after a day of snowboarding (ok that isn't sooo often).  At lunch I go for the pad thai w/ soft tofu, #2 spicy, egg ok.  My vegetarian pals love the joint as well.  BTW, if noodles sound a bit heavy today, the Mee krob appetizer is like the pad thai w/ the egg & shrimp but with the airy crispy white noodles w/ sweet sauce to hold it together.

Dinner I go for the regular pad thai and the steamed fish.  The curries are tasty but small portions."}
{"text":"Nice little local hole in the wall authentic Thai restaurant. Good lunch specials that run around $7.95 to $9.95. Our waitress was a total sweetheart too. I recommend the Pad Se Iew, the Thai Iced Tea, and any of the fried rice dishes. 

Tip -don't ask them to make your dish \"spicy\" unless you can take it because they are not messing around with their chile!"}
{"text":"Been to this place twice.  Both time we had to wait for the food for 30 minutes.  The food tastes delicious and the portion is good too! But man, wait time is just...  Horrible!!! Not enough people working to accommodate the traffic.  Twice,  it was the same thing! We came in a group of 5 people the first time and 3 the second time. Both were on Saturday nights.  There were 3 people working in the front the first time and this time only 2.  The restaurant was packed.  Even other tables were waiting for their food as well. They did try to get your drinks as soon as possible but it took them forever to get your order and the food out.  Love the food and everything else but I won't be back because of the wait time."}
{"text":"Just got home from eating there...

*****NEVER AGAIN!!*****

Service: POOR

Took 20 minutes to get Vegetable Spring Rolls to the table, and 30 seconds later came my Pad Thai.  8 minutes after that, my wife's Vegetable Curry came.

Food: POOR

Pad Thai:  Average (at best) flavor.  The shrimp may not have been fresh because they were awfully \"fishy\".

Vegetable Curry:  Flavorless (spice level 4 too!) 

They don't even have Thai cooks...they are Mexican!  I don't want Thai people cooking my Mexican food either!"}
{"text":"This is a regular lunch spot for me and my co-workers.  If you go in at lunch time, you will see that it is a regular place for a lot of people.  It can get very busy, but the staff does a great job of providing top notch service even when packed.

I am not an expert on Thai food, but I have not tried anything there that wasn't outstanding.  It is really hard to come up with a favorite, just try any of the lunch specials and you can't go wrong.

One word of warning, they let you pick your level of spiciness, and I find that if you are sensitive to spicy food, you might want to be a bit conservative."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite Thai restaurant in the greater Phoenix area. The ambience is nice ~ jazz music and dimly lit enough to make the small restaurant feel more intimate. 
The servers are super nice and the food comes out piping hot and really quickly. The food tastes amazing and is an affordable price. I always have enough leftover to take home for another full meal."}
{"text":"Delicious, fast, friendly and fresh! I highly recommend getting the Pad Woon Sen with Chicken. It is light and filling.  Never leave this place without having the Thai Tea.  It is my favorite Thai Tea from all of the thai restaurants in the valley.  I went during lunch several times and they will have you in and out within 30 mins.  Highly recommended for a business lunch or a family dinner."}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed their spicy noodles dish.   However, the petit waitress could be a little more friendly."}
{"text":"No Mystery.. it's Thai! We have added this to our \"lunch place rotation\" at work! Rolls up every week ... I've been here 4 or 5 times and it's always very very good. We have a small group--which means I've seen most of the menu. So far SOOOO good! Calm, clean atmosphere with fast service even at lunch rush. The water glasses are always full... that helps when you order \"Thai Hot\". Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The first time we went to Swaddee the food was great and not very spicy and i ordered a 3 out of 5 for spicy and 5 being the very hot. The second time we went with friends with us that did not like very spicy so we ordered 2's and 1's so we could all share but we got 5. I brought this up to the waiter but he did not seem to care very much."}
{"text":"Is there really no great Thai in Scottsdale?  

After a disappointing visit to Malee's on Main last year, I decided to try Swaddee Thai on this visit to Scottsdale.  The restaurant is casual but clean and decorated nicely, but the service is unfriendly and the food is just OK.  

I ordered veggie spring rolls, which appeared to be raw on the menu but arrived deep fried.  For my entree I ordered a yellow curry chicken.  The curry sauce was thin and watery... not at all like the thicker sauce I'm used to.

It wasn't bad, I just wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"I had really high expectations after I read the reviews. We ordered the combo appetizer platter and were underwhelmed. The eggroll consisted of bland, greasy cabbage and no meat. The wonton was dried out and the filling was a little dollop of what looked to be sweet potato. The satay was rubbery and inedible and if I had never had Thai toast before, Swaddee's Thai would ensure that I would never order it again. We had higher hopes for the entrees and again we were disappointed. My boyfriend ordered the Yellow Curry and I ordered the Pad Thai. We both asked for medium hot. What he received was a watery curry flavored soup with no heat. I got a plate full of watered down noodles that tasted like they came from a box with a flavor packet that you add on later. I hate writing critical reviews but this was truly one of the most mediocre Thai restaurants I have ever been to."}
{"text":"They have improved a LOT since I last visited in Jan 2016. Interior, music, cleanness, and most importantly food quality are all improved. I love a business that strikes to improve over time!"}
{"text":"3.5 Stars

Swadee is pretty great for takeout.  They have a big karaoke stage in the front which I have never seen in action, but if that is your thing it should be entertaining.   I really like the big fish tank with actually lively looking goldfish. The wait staff have always been very friendly and the service quick.   They tend to make the food on the mild side so I usually go with hot.  If you are looking for good takeout thai food with friendly staff and goldfish then check this place out."}
{"text":"Swaddee's is....all right. As I was answering a question in one of the talk threads, I realized, though, that it's spicy-meter is a bit inconsistent. I've had times when the pad Thai, at a 3, is more than I can handle. At other times, I've ordered a curry at \"medium\" only to find out it's not spicy in the least...
Basically, I think this place is a solid choice for Thai, but it's by no means earth-shattering or anything like that. I actually like the lunch options better than dinner here. The first few times I've eaten at Swaddee's have  all been at lunch, and I've been impressed. But then I ordered the Panang curry to-go, for dinner. I asked for it with tofu, and I got a curry with tofu and onions. That's it. No veggies, nothing. That's really odd for a Thai restaurant. It wasn't flavorful, either. Then I went here last week for dinner, and ordered pad Thai. The noodles were a bit dry and hard, although I have to say, the service was great.
All in all, I think I'll continue to come here for lunch, but when it comes to dinner, I'll probably try to seek out some new Thai restaurants."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! !!!! You can tell they take great pride in their restaurant. How many times have you gone to a little \"hole in the wall\" place and the condiments on the table are filthy and well used? Their plastic condiment holders were sparkling  clean. Their portions were enough for 2 ppl to share. Prices are extremely reasonable. I was really surprised at the presentation of every plate. I felt like I was eating at a fancy restaurant downtown. Truly a culinary experience that delighted the taste buds. I will most definitely be back many times."}
{"text":"If I had a Thai Granny  this place would remind me of her! 
Note,,This is a GOOD thing!  
The atmosphere here is cozy, pleasant, with relaxed  lighting and delicate thai music playing that reminds me of opening a old jewelery box  triggering a ballerina to twirl about. Tall curio cabinets display cute thai trinkets. (nice overall atmosphere).
 Don't worry fellas there are a few thai headgear/mask decorations to balance out the overall atmosphere. 
Food was delicious, generous and priced fairly."}
{"text":"My wife and I eat here when we go on a date without the kids.  One of my daughters is allergic to peanuts, so a Thai restaurant is not an ideal place to take her.

We've eaten at all of the Thai restaurants in the East Valley, and this place is still our favorite.  This is where we go to get our fix when we crave spicy Thai food.

Everything we've ordered has been pretty good.  We haven't had an unsatisfactory meal here yet.  

There is a reason this restaurant has stood the test of time (and the economy).  Their food and service is great."}
{"text":"Went for Sunday at lunch, 
1. Can't understand the servers and they can't understand you so they get your order incorrect.
2. A little pricey for the quality of food in my opinion. You get a lot of food, but not the best tasting Thai Cuisine. 
3. It messes with your stomach 

Wouldn't recommend, would go to Panda Express any day over here"}
{"text":"This place is next to my favorite chineese place. I tried it for lunch and had the Green Curry. It was $7.95 and I am full. This place has what you want. It is very good food, good service and its a clean quiet atmosphere. I like it very much and I will continue to go there."}
{"text":"Swaddee is my favorite Thai restaurant in the area.  It's pleasantly upscale without being pretentious, and I've liked almost everything I've ordered over several years of patronage.  If you want something special, try the Coconut Paradise, seafood in a young coconut--my favorite.  I also love the curries, with shrimp or chicken (but skip the duck) and pad thai.  When they have it, the mango and sticky rice dessert is very nice, but pass on the fried bananas.  I occasionally feel like I'm not on the same wavelength with the Thai staff, but have never found anyone to be rude or inattentive, in fact they make every effort to please."}
{"text":"We went by Swaddee for dinner on a Friday night and there were only a couple of people there ... Really surprised it wasn't busy based on the reviews. I think I'd give this restaurant more of a 2.5 but I rounded up.

Obviously we were seated right away, and soon after, we placed our order and the food came out in a reasonable amount of time. We got the Swaddee Fried Rice (medium spice) and the Cashew Nuts Delight (medium hot spice). The Cashew Nuts Delight definitely had a kick to it and was really tasty. I thought that there were a lot of cashews in there but too many vegetables compared to chicken. The Swaddee Fried Rice was almost too sweet with the pineapple (which it doesn't say it has in it on the menu, I think?), raisins, and Chinese Sausage. We had gotten a glass of the Thai Tea as well; it was $2.50 and came in a much smaller glass than it does at other restaurants.

I thought that the prices were a bit higher for the entrees than other places, but the portion sizes were maybe larger than at other places. Not sure when/if we will be back. With so many other Thai restaurants to pick from, we'll venture to try something different in the future."}
{"text":"The BEST Pad Thai & Spicy noodles. Love getting the take out. Staff are always very friendly! This is our go to for Thai!"}
{"text":"Love the food.  Good customer service and price is amazing for the quality of food. Kind of hidden at the back of the mall.  Nice atmosphere for little place.  Don't miss it."}
{"text":"Not only the best Thai food anywhere, it's some of the best food you can get, anywhere, period.  The red curry with chicken is so good it should be illegal."}
{"text":"I love Swaddee. I always get the broccoli on wok with beef and my husband enjoys the cashew chicken. I think the prices are reasonable and you get a lot of food."}
{"text":"Very delicious. I had the chicken pad thai, spicy level 2 which was not spicy but very very delicious & full of flavor. The staff is helpful & courteous I would definitely eat here again & recommend it to anyone. But if you're like me & like it spicy, order it level 4-5 :)"}
{"text":"Excellent, consistent, hot food. Never disappointed. Faves: Hot Basil chicken, Cashew Nut Chicken, Pad thai, and Tom Yum soup. Friendly staff and clean environment. We go more than once a week."}
{"text":"Swaddee, what happened?! I used to love you. I guess now that I've been exposed to really wonderful, flavorful Thai, your restaurant just isn't as appealing to me as it was 10 years ago.

My husband and I dined at the Chandler location recently since it's near his work. He got the house salad which was just a standard salad with bland peanut dressing. What upset him is that the \"shrimp\" listed in the description was just that-- ONE SHRIMP, singular.

I got the spicy eggplant figuring that would be a good choice since eggplant is in season. It was just ok. I tasted more grease than anything else, but I was missing all those hot/sour/sweet/bitter elements that I expect with Thai food.

Luckily there are other Thai places in the area. It's time to move on."}
{"text":"Swaddee is the only restaurant that I have to go to every time when I come back to visit family. It is still my favorite Thai place that I have visited. The food tastes great, portions are large, and the value (lunch specials on weekdays) is amazing. My favorite dish from them is the pad Thai, which is perfectly cooked. I would also recommend the yellow curry, pad see ew, and spicy noodles. The pineapple fried rice is also wonderful. I have also had other dishes, but these are the ones that I love most. Service and the environment are perfect for nice occasions or just casual eating. 

Over the years, the spicy scale of 1-5 is not very consistent unless you are on the 1 side."}
{"text":"After reading Yelp reviews of Swaddee, I had to give it a go! I was the first person there today shortly after opening. I had time to spare until my next appt. of the day, so I hung around for 1 hr 10 minutes to observe for my Review. :) At 11:30am partrons started coming for their to go and walk-ins rolled in. Man is this place hopping. I watched 25 to go orders and 20 seated inside in the short time I was there.

I ordered my usual from Pei Wei - the Pad Thai. Hands down, *the best.* Now, Pei Wei is a slight glimmer of hope of my return. The Pad Thai was not greasy,.felt fresh and not sticky. The spicy scale from 1 to 5, I choose 1. Glad I did as was enough for me. Can't imagine a 4 for 5. :) They didn't charge me for the Thai Tea (I ordered because of reviews here) and it is an acquired taste for some people if they are not familiar -- I really liked it. For dessert, Coconut Ice Cream **Note: topped with peanuts...not a good idea to me; kills the coconut flavor.

I will be back. And given the distance, that says something. :)"}
{"text":"My review is purely on the sticky rice - since that's all I got from here.

I was visiting my in-laws and wanted to grab sticky rice for my son since I didn't have the stuff to make it myself. It's $3 for one order. The lady there told me it wasn't much rice, so I ordered two orders.

She was honest about it being a small portion, so I wasn't too upset about that. I was annoyed that one of the two tiny orders wasn't even edible. I got the bottom of the warmer/dried out sticky rice. My two year old could eat a whole order himself - their portions were that small. I had to throw out a whole order and my son ate the entire second order.

I may be a sticky rice snob but even for ppl who aren't sticky rice snobs...if you're guna charge $3/order, make it worth $3."}
{"text":"Vacationing in Chandler and the family (well mom and dad, myself) were craving Thai. Yelp delivered as usual. Pad Thai, Panang curry, spicy (level 3 was blazing!)seafood fried rice were all great. Kids liked the teriyaki chicken (not too sweet or sticky) was also good. Spicy Eggplant was just ok in my book, but the wife liked it. Could use some more veggies in the dishes though. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent. I love the chicken and noodles. That's all I've ever gotten, but it is amazing. I go here whenever I visit Arizona."}
{"text":"This was the first and only Thai place I've been to in AZ.  Overall, it is pretty good.  I think we will probably try a new place next time but if we can't find anything better, I think we won't have any problem going back to Swaddee.

*Price = on the high-end 
*Pad Thai = pretty good volume
*Green Curry = very good.
*Garlic delight = The portion is way too small to charge $11"}
{"text":"Waited almost 20 min before we waved someone down to take our order. \"Yea, I'm busy\" was her response. Fried rice was soggy. BBQ chicken was bland. Only dish I enjoyed was their Tom yom soup. I had to go to the counter to get our to go box and check. We won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I've been going here for a few years but not sure due to the recent changes in service protocol. Food is generally good but the restaurant does tend to nickel and dime. It's charges 18% automatically for parties of five. I think it should be 6 especially since I have three young kids. I understand it their policy but I think they are tryin to make people automatically forced to pay more. Also, I asked for side of white rice for our party of five and they charged $8 for white rice. That is ridiculous.  Most restaurants charge $4-5 which I think is a fair price. I can buy a 10lb bag of rice for $10! Not sure I will be back."}
{"text":"Extraordinarily delicious!  Great service.  Honored a couple special requests regarding food prep.  The dish was served to my personal absolute perfection!  Strongly recommend the Thai iced coffee."}
{"text":"Nice neighborhood gem in an area filled with lame chains, closed store fronts and awful dive bar food. I've had better Thai, but this place's food is solid an actually makes you feel like you're in a real city for 45 minutes or so. Bookend the meal with a Tsing Tao and some coconut ice cream and you're all set."}
{"text":"It was a very long wait; about an hour. But, on the contrary the food was delectable."}
{"text":"tI recently relocated to Phoenix from Silicon Valley, where there are fantastic Thai restaurants pretty much everywhere.  I decided to try Swaddee based on reviews here.  This is my opinion on what I tried:

1. Tom Ka Gai Soup:  To be fair, I am comparing this dish to what is generally considered to be the BEST Tom Ka Gai in the SF Bay Area (Dusita Thai in Sunnyvale).  I'd give this dish a 4/5.  The flavor was spot on, but light on ingredients.  Also, they didn't use those little button mushrooms, and for the $ they are charging, I think it should have the correct mushrooms!
2. Green Curry:  5/5.  Superb.  Fabulous.  They could add some eggplant though.
3. Spicy Fried Rice:  4.5/5.  The flavor was good, it was cooked properly.  If they offered it with crab, it would be mind blowing.
4. Green Papaya Salad:  3/5.  I was disappointed that the sauce wasn't quite right.  I don't know what makes the dressing so tangy, but they should use more of whatever that is!
5. Spiciness:  I order my Thai food as 'Thai Spicy'.  Seriously, restaurants will question me repeatedly because they are afraid to serve it to me the way I like it.  I ordered everything except the Green Papaya Salad as a '5', which is supposed to be their Thai spicy.  Not so.  They would have had to double it to give me what I was expecting.  

That said, it was quite good and I will return.  However, I'm going to try a few other places first..............."}
{"text":"Spicy basil with pork. So good. Got it to go. Spice level ordered was level 7 out of 10. Probably too spicy for most but addictingly delicious."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed by my experience here. I am not sure if they are the same Swaddee that used to be down in Scottsdale, but I've been meaning to come here since that one closed. 

I ordered a glass of wine and a veggie yellow curry, heat 4. Personally I expect the heat 4 to be hot. It was medium. Especially on a curry scale. 

I asked for extra potatoes in the curry. The first time, it came out with no potatoes. I asked if they perhaps didn't have potatoes. She apologized and asked if she could take it back. It came back with ~4 small potato halves in it. Not what I expected. The curry was ok, but it's extra watery and the flavors aren't absorbed by the vegetables. 

The wine came out after the food. You get a 10% discount if you pay in cash, but all together this was $20 with the tip."}
{"text":"Honestly I was not a Thai food fan but one of my coworkers is so go along. Well after eating here I'm a fan! Warning spice scale is misleading. 1-5 where 1 is hot."}
{"text":"The only reason they're not getting 5 stars is the service is slow on most days. But, if you have the time, the food is excellent, best Tom Yum soup in the valley."}
{"text":"We love this place. 

If you go for an early dinner it is good for kids (high chairs there). 

Their food is great, service is fast and staff is nice and is really a hidden gem.  

Love their green curry (more rice would be nice though) and their sampler app is the best thing to get (YUM!)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Thai restaurants.   The Tom Yum is really very authentic and I enjoy the gai gatiam pad thai or garlic chicken.    I have not been back since I turned vegetarian, but know I can get some excellent vegi dishes.   Service and take out is great.   Strongly recommend."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant for my birthday on the recommendation of a coworker- best recommendation ever!

I was so impressed with the service and the delicious food that I drug a friend visiting from San Francisco there for dinner.  He was impressed with the curried duck dish he ordered, and that they had his favorite imported beer.  He claims that Swaddee is far better than any Thai restaurant he has found in SF.

The prices are reasonable, the food and service is great, and the atmosphere is really nice. 

Recommended:  Beef or chicken Prig Khing curry, pork fried rice, red curry duck, and a \"Thai Iced Tea\"."}
{"text":"Best Thai in the neighborhood for sure.  Always prompt service & food comes out quickly, great for work lunches.  I order take-out from here on the reg as well & it's always ready on time & exactly what I asked for, down to the seventeen different requests from my picky peeps..."}
{"text":"What are all the 5-star reviews about??

I was led here due to the great reviews to this Thai restaurant. Even upon arriving, I was utterly disappointed. My family and I were placed in a corner (when the entire restaurant was pretty much vacant) next to another family with a baby in a highchair. This created kind of an uncomfortable space for us to even enjoy our meal. I thought the food was terrible (ie, the duck that I bit into was extremely salty, and even bit into salt during each bite. My duck was burnt as well). The service was VERY POOR- with three tables out of the many you have available in the restaurant, and the number of waiters, I'd think we would have exceptional service. I was wrong. Our waiter was in the back eating a meal. At a table. In front of all customers.

I have never wanted to leave a restaurant without consuming my food. This was the first time. Doggy bag? NO THANK YOU. If I could give zero stars, I would. For restaurant-goers looking for actual good and decent food, do not go here."}
{"text":"This place is a hit or miss. Hence why I would rate it as average.  I've been here so many times for lunch because it's so close to work and because coworkers would suggest it.  I've had all the curries and every time the spiciness is different even though I ask for a 3.  Sometimes it's not spicy at all and sometimes it's so spicy that my mouth burns.  

I've had the eggplant with chicken, but the chicken isn't as moist and tender as I hoped meat would taste like. They chopped up the chicken in very small pieces and seemed overcooked.  I would stick with the different types of curries (red, green, yellow) though.  It's safer.  The curry sauce would seep into the meat and make it more tender. The curries can also be different textures.  I've had it where it's thick and creamy (the way I like it) or more watered down.  The lunch portions are pretty small, but I guess it's enough for a lunch meal.  

Beware Swaddee's if you're not too comfortable with spicy.  Just order a lower number and you can add more chili if it's not spicy enough for you.  I still would recommend this place and try your luck with the food here.  You may get lucky and have a great meal."}
{"text":"Swaddee is awesome. I love the Chicken Noodles and the Thai Iced Tea. This place can get a little hectic during lunch so go early if you can. When you order they ask you how spicy you want your food, 1-5. I always get a 3, but the spice can be anywhere from a 2-4 which works for me."}
{"text":"Overall I enjoyed my dinner here.  I was disapointed that they didn't have veggie spring rolls in rice paper that aren't deep fried.  I realize that it is more of a Vietnamese dish but most Thai places serve it... I will stick with the ones that do."}
{"text":"I used to work by Swaddee's, and I really enjoyed the food.  My first visit was at the urging of a lot of my colleagues at work, and I was hooked from that point on!  

I was really addicted to the various curries there (red being my favorite).  I thought the red curry had the most heat and the best balance among sweet, savory, and heat.  I also really enjoyed the chicken & cabbage soup that came with the entree.

Over my many visits, I never had a bad meal.  I was always able to get in and out within an hour, and the prices are quite good for the quality of the food.

If you have never had one, be sure to try the Thai Iced Tea."}
{"text":"Red curry was watery and rather average.  Hot and spicy noodles were tasty, although I wish there were more noodles than the rest of the items in there.  Seemed to be filler items like iceberg lettuce in this dish, which were rather random.  I

f you want delicious Thai food, go to Siam Thai in Glendale!  Still my favorite in the Valley.  No other Thai place I've tried out has measured up."}
{"text":"A fantastic dinner.  The spicy noodles with shrimp was simply excellent.  The shrimp itself was especially tasty.

First class service.

A great restaurant tucked into a strip mall."}
{"text":"This food is fantastic!!! Very authentic and so yummy. Everything tasted so good. The presentation was marvelous! They really care about this. The vegetables were so fresh! I enjoyed every bit of this food. The server was also so kind, nice and attentive. My new fave restaurant. Prices were so reasonable too. It may not be glamorous in appearance but if you know anything about excellent authentic ethnic food the restaurants never look like much but the food is excellent!!!"}
{"text":"Sure I like Thai do you like shirt? 

Swaddee Thai is another strong local Thai restaurant that could use slightly lower prices for lunch time. 

Every time I was in for a visit I had the red curry tofu, The sauce was rich and spicy as expected, the vegetables were a bit sparse compared to other Thai places and the tofu was not as firm as I would have liked. It came in smallish round bowl.

I did appreciate the fact that they did make my meal quite spicy when I asked for it.

This place is decent but there are better options in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This place is great!  I've been here a few times so far and have ordered the Green curry, red curry and pad thai, all of which are great!!  The service is friendly, however once it was a little slow.  The food makes up for it though!

I usually do takeout because I have noticed that you get bigger portions that way.  The curry comes in a huge to-go container!!"}
{"text":"Good fast service. Pad See Iew was very good. Garlic delight was good. Large portions. Pretty much everything we had was good. We'll be back."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, I usually order the pad Thai and get a pretty fair portion every time I order. The people that work there don't seem like they like being there and are pretty rude for the most part. I would recommend just getting take out so you don't have to bother with them."}
{"text":"Mediocre, forgettable experience. We ordered pineapple fried rice, pad thai and something else I can't recall. One note flavor in all the dishes. I've had better Thai in a mall food court."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Saturday, and it wasn't too busy, unlike their weekday lunch rushes. We ordered the pad thai, pad see ew, and green curry lunch specials. The lunch specials are a really good deal, at only $8 for a large portion, salad, and egg roll! (The salad and egg roll weren't that impressive though)

I really liked the flavor of the pad thai (and that it came with peanuts!), but was disappointed because the pad see ew was really over-sauced. The green curry was good, but nothing special. So I would recommend the pad thai. The staff was also very friendly, and there's a 10% discount if you pay in cash!"}
{"text":"My experience with Thai food has been so consistent that if I were to to rate every dish I've ever had, the bell curve would be as thin as a bamboo shoot.  I don't know what it is but I've never been disappointed with any Thai dish or restaurant that I've eaten at.

Swaddee is no exception.  Everything there is very good.  Maybe a tad better than most of the competition."}
{"text":"This place always completes my Thai craving.  I'm not a Thai expert & I'm not going to pretend to be... I can pronounce anything on their menu.  but I absolutely love Pad Thai.

Swaddee Thai is a little pricey for me... yikes... (then again, I am a seriously broke college student & a barista so I'm sure if you're a normal professional human, you'll be just fine)... their lunch specials are awesome.

Whenever I go, it is always empty!!!  Usually not a great sign... but I think I just get cravings at weird times.  HAH.  Always order a Thai Iced Tea... because it is some sort of sugar coma inducing tradition.  Delicious.

But to the main reason I'm writing this review!!!  PAD THAI.  The shrimp are always plump... the noodles are always just right... the seasoning is exactly what I want and need out of my Pad Thai dish.  The bean sprouts are crunchy and wonderful.  I'm a wimp & I get zero to none spicy because I can't take it otherwise & it's usually still spicy?  I think they do that just to spite me.

I've had their pineapple fried rice before which I would describe as... Meeeh.  Take it or leave it.  I think I found two and a half chunks of pineapple within the rice.

They always treat you well here... keep your glasses full... I love it."}
{"text":"I think there are only two things I know--Thai and Vietnamese. In my opinion, I think Swadee was good, but a bit overpriced for what I ordered.

I got the red curry beef, and red curry is the first dish I try to order at Thai places to test their tastiness. I order it 10 stars, or double Thai hot. Yeah, I'm weird, I know. It was very good, but at $10.95, it looked more like the portion I see for lunch everywhere else.

Boyfriend got the beef chow mein, which was a bigger portion and was pretty good. Nothing to yelp about, but he liked it. The pad thai was a bit too sweet for my liking and a bit mushy. The plate was huge, and so I figured they made up for my dish with my friend's. I didn't need to eat that much, anyway.

Others got the spicy basil, which got mixed reviews, the panang curry and the spicy basil with eggplant. The latter was really good from the bites I took, while I think the panang was good but not over the top. Another got the thai barbecued chicken, which must have been good because it was almost gone at the end of dinner. It's on fire when they bring it out, so that's fun. 

I wanted to rate Swaddee a 3.5, but service was great, so here's a 4. Malee's is still the best on my list, followed by Yupha's and then a tie between Lemongrass and Thai Basil.

Props for being one of the few Thai places in Chandler. Since there are many in my area, I really enjoy living in Tempe. :)"}
{"text":"One of the best Thai places I have eaten at here in Phoenix. There are a few must tries. The Tom Kha soup is fantastic. It's a coconut and lemon grass based soup. It has chicken, mushrooms, and other spices. Delicious. I have also had the Swaddee fried rice, the spicy noodles, and the chicken garlic delight. All have been delicious. 
The cool thing about this place is that you get to choose how spicy your food is. They use a 1-5 scale, 5 being the spiciest. The 2 is a moderate medium. I haven't ventured past that. Give it a try if ur looking for Thai!"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with the Lunch Special. Chicken Noodles and Thai fried rice are favorites."}
{"text":"So popular at lunchtime that there's a line extending out of the restaurant into the plaza with people waiting to get in. My wait time was 15 minutes last time I went. (Note: This will now result in 25 different Yelpers coming here and giving us their oh so original thoughts using one of the three following cliched lines: \"Not worth the hype!\"; \"Not worth the wait!\"; and/or \"I'm from [some crappy economically depressed part of the country which explains why I'm in Arizona] where they really know how to make Thai food, and this isn't that.\")

Eff them. The curry bowls are the most delicious things on earth."}
{"text":"Monday 11 June 2012, my wife & I had dinner here. We had the beef salad for appetizer. We shared a chicken vegetable stir-fry dish. The spiciness of both dishes were at 4/5. The appetizer was OK. The cook didn't even bother to trim the cabbage leaves of the old wilted parts, which substracted from the experience. The pieces of beef were cut a bit too thick, and they were a bit too salty. 

The chicken vegetable stir fry was delicious and tasty. We had to add a bit more dried red pepper to both dishes as we found neither spicy enough. 

The best dish was the desert - golden banana, which were 2 pieces of banana and shredded coconut wrapped in rice paper and deep fried. We requested an additional scoop of coconut ice cream for an additional charge. Totally worth it. 

We will be back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service. Try the chicken or tofu soup with coconut milk. None of the items were greasy. They were well made and spicy. Worth going back."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Excellent pad Thai. Very authentic menu"}
{"text":"I definitely go here when I'm in the area... good flavors and quality food for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"I agree with alot of reviewers that this place was \"awight\". I didn't bother looking at the reviews before I went-I was just following my aunt's suggestion so we made plans as a family (with my parents in town) to eat there. I looked at the menu and was 'thrilled' to find a vegetarian section, and the family didn't consciously find a restaurant that is vegetarian-friendly for me (talk about jewish guilt trip). So I went with much anticipation (a sad symptom of vegetarianism in a meat-eating world when you discover that a restaurant has a vegetarian dish and are quick to assume that the dish will be DELICIOUS. It sucks that you're not able to choose from a variety of selections, but Not ALL vegetarian dishes are delicious. I'm working on this. Smile). Well, the dishes didn't BLOW me away-it was  *half-smirk* eatable. I ordered a hot and sour soup with tofu (Tom Yum), which was good. Then I ate Tofu Coconut Princess with #2 spicy (they have a 5-rating spice scale), and it WAS not spicy at all (and my aunt warned that #2 is VERY spicy), and the tofu was overcooked. Lucikly, the coconut was able to compensate for that. I brought home the leftover for my boyfriend, and he has a very critical palate since he's a cook-he wasn't impressed with it. The dishes are OVER-PRICED for what they're worth if I had to pay (my dad had to foot the bill for a party of 6).

I'm a bit surprised of the awards they've received-what was the criterion? Is a vegetarian on the committee of \"Best of Phoenix\"? That's what I would like to know.

I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone who has high expectations of food."}
{"text":"Been here recently and it looks like there have been a few changes to a couple dishes.  First, it looks like they are no longer using the HUGE shrimps in their dishes.  Rather they have swapped then our for smaller shrimp and reduced the price.  Also, the sticky rice and custard now comes is the shape of an heart (and is yellow) but lost a bit on the side of texture and sweetness.  Nonetheless this is still one of my favorite Thai restaurants in the Tempe/Chandler area and is a must try for any Thai food lover!"}
{"text":"After having lived in Seattle for seven years, there are just a few things I haven't even tried here in the Phoenix area.  Sushi for example.  Or, I guess, seafood in general.  For some strange reason, Thai food has been on the list of things that I just hadn't ventured out to try here, assuming there's no way it could live up to how great the options were in Seattle.

Then, for a co-workers birthday, I went here.  Not only was I immediately impressed with the service, the waitress recommended Thai iced tea - and it was just delicious.  I got the Pad See Ew w/ beef (5 stars 'cause that's how I roll) and it was fantastical.  The lunch special (like $8) also came with a small spring roll - which I dipped in the leftover peanut salad dressing.. just wow.

So, A for ambiance, service, and perfect Thai cuisine on a very busy Friday lunch.  Brian talk Thai - Brian talk Thai VERY good."}
{"text":"Monty and I went again for lunch, really good, he had curry again because he just cant help himself - yellow this time, and he said it was super duper good... but hot - not TOO hot though.

I had the pad thai - frickin good!  Different than I have had before, but really good, spicy (3), perfect balance of everything.  YUM!"}
{"text":"Under new management as of July 2013, and renamed Cha Da Thai. Very nice people and very good food. I look forward to returning. They also did a nice job remodeling - very nice decor."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a Thai place in the Phoenix metro area, you've found it. When I first moved to Phoenix, I discovered the Swaddee Thai location in Chandler. A few years later, I moved to N Phoenix, and I was thankful to find that there was another Swaddee Thai close to me!

My favorite things on the menu are tofu coconut princess and Tom Ka, a coconut milk / mushroom soup. I love the amount of vegetarian options; you even get a choice of soft or fried tofu!

The service here is fast, the food is fantastic, and this is a great place to seek out for a delicious lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I really like Swaddee. As you may have noticed from my pics, I am not Thai. I probably don't know diddly about what \"authentic\" Thai food should taste like. But what I DO know is Swaddee makes great curry. Very addicting, with the perfect balance of hot and sweet. 

Their lunch Special is very good and resonaly priced, too. choose one main dish out of more than a dozen choices with your choice of beef, chicken, pork, or tofu, plus salad, egg roll, steamed rice."}
{"text":"So nummy. I usually get a lunch special when I go (pad thai, curry or garlic chicken), because it's convenient, but today I decided to get the spicy eggplant (Makur Yao). YUM!!!!  It was absolutely perfectly cooked (soft eggplant makes a happy Tyger) (although the portion was way too big for lunch, but lucky ducky me, I have a refrigerator and think it will be delicious for lunch tomorrow too).  

My friend ordered the green curry (for her SECOND time! It's a RECORD! *the crowd goes wild*) and she loved it just as much this time as she did the first time. Not to mention they are very speedy, which is a lunch-time miracle for the person who tries to do four different things within her 60-minute mid-day break. 

I even had time to get an iced coffee from 'bucks. Yay! (Yes, this is evidence of my post-venti triple shot cinnamon dolce on ice) Zzzzzip! Wibble! BOING! (I need to calm down). :) YUMMY EGGPLANT!"}
{"text":"Fast service and really great quality Thai food, this restaurant is perfect for the office worker that need a new lunch spot. I've been coming here since I was a little kid. I remember during summer break my mom would pick me up for lunch and we would go to Swaddee for their lunch specials haha. The Shrimp Curry is my go to and I like my food spicy so I usually do 4/5 stars and then brown rice instead of white rice. I have tried almost all of the lunch specials and they are all delicious especially their red curries and noodle dishes! You always get a small salad with peanut sauce and a spring roll with your lunch special and if you have room for dessert you NEED to try their Coconut Ice Cream. It is out of this world with salty crunchy peanuts on top, I could eat it forever! I will definitely be back to this establishment very soon!"}
{"text":"Wow, the Thai Fried RIce is so amazing here.  It has lots of flavor.  Any of the Pork dishes are good.  I really enjoyed the food and staff here."}
{"text":"I first had this Thai food in flagstaff and was in love! I figured I would try this location and it did not disappoint! 

The tofu is always cooked perfectly and I've heard the chicken is great too.

I usually get either the yellow curry or the pad thai. Both of them come in epic preportions and I have lunch for the next day. The tom kha soup is delicious!

Go for the lunch special, it's cheap and the portions are still huge. 

The service is fast and you won't get stuck waiting for food for too long!"}
{"text":"Came here for a lunch party.  The place was super decorated.  A little sensory overload.  We were 1 of 2 tables there.  And the service was slow.  I ordered the pad sei saw with chicken.  It was a little sweeter than I like, but it was ok."}
{"text":"We are coming to this place since we moved to Phoenix last year. It's has become our go-to place for Thai food. Food are delectable and yum. My personal favorite is Penang Curry, Green Curry and Red Curry. My wife loves Thai Iced Coffee. I will also recommend Chicken Satay. 

I feel Pad Thai needs improvement."}
{"text":"Had been to this place awhile ago (probably previous owners or before they remodeled) and was ok with the food but it was a bit dated (and there was a bug on my table).

Years later came back with a coworker and wow have things changed! They've since redecorated and it's super clean now (no more fear of bugs).

The pad thai I had was delicious and coconut ice cream was awesome. Highly recommend this place if you're looking to get a Thai fix."}
{"text":"Excellent food, but horrible service. We stopped by to try this restaurant today because my friend said the food was great. I would love to give 5stars for the food because we've eaten at many Thai Food Restaurant, and this one taste better than most places. I didn't asked for the server name, but she was the short and a bit chubby girl. Bring out the food and 5min later she bring us the check without saying anything, and every time I raised my hand to ask for something, she saw me but then ignore and look away. The whole time, no greeting, no saying thanks you, nothing. We end up leaving the tips for the kitchen, instead of the servers because we received the worst service ever."}
{"text":"I like this place. Parking is easy in back. Service is good. Price is reasonable. I like to get the Pad Thai level 5 hot. I also like the Fried Rice with Pork. I suggest you go  with level 5 heat and lots of water."}
{"text":"We went to this place for lunch and it was pretty crowded during lunch time. The ambience is clean and pretty decent. We had to wait couple of minutes to be seated. 

We ordered Tom kha, Roasted duck  and Chicken Pad thai. Sweetness was overpowering Tom kha, but overall it was good and liked how it was brought to us with fire to keep it boiling. Roasted duck was not up to the mark, the duck was way dry and flaky. Pad thai though on a level 4 of spice was way sweet to my taste. The food color or the sauce color didn't impress me, it was an ok dish. 
I am not totally going with the place nor am I letting it down. The price is average and ok for quick lunch."}
{"text":"Had been to the one in Flagstaff several times and it has great lunch specials, finally we went to the one in Chandler for dinner and it was very good.  Nice proportions, reasonably priced, & good service."}
{"text":"foods pretty quick and always taste fresh.  But, Thai hot isn't hot.  I can never get a consistent spice level from that place."}
{"text":"Bottom line - when I'm in the mood for Thai in my neck of the woods, this is it. Just beware you absolutely MUST avoid this place at the peak lunch rush - go before or after as it is stand-out-the-door-waiting busy as the Intel crowd (as well as other client√®le) swarm the place for lunch. That is a testament to how good the food is and how reasonably priced it is - as long as you stick to the lunch specials, as others have noted.

Have never been for dinner, so can't speak to that."}
{"text":"I would recommend the Red Curry, very good. The Thai Ice Tea was good, but not the best I've had. Customer Service was excellent. I will return to give more menu items a try."}
{"text":"Chicago girl now living in Chandler.  Found this gem in a strip mall and it reminds me of home, where you can find authentic world cuisine anywhere.  Swaddee Thai is awesome!  All the curries have depth of flavor, the peanut sauce is to die for, and I love the tofu options.  The service is quick and friendly, prices are cheap for the quality.  I eat there once a week.  LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"Nice decor.  The food would get a pass if it wasn't so over priced.  The spicy noodles were rubbery (not fresh)  We ordered it Hot and had to add 4 tablespoons full of red peppers.  The panang was watery and also, not as spicy as requested.  The Service was adequate.  This will be the first and last trip to Swaddee.

There are many other Thai places that serve better food at much more reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Worst Thai restaurant I ever visited. Their curry dishes are awful. PLEASE DO NOT ORDER RED CURRY OR GREEN CURRY!
your best options are spicy noodles and pad Thai! 
I was not happy with taste. Decent ambience but not so good food!"}
{"text":"I arrived at lunch time it was really busy... I stood there to be seated for while and I finally ask someone what they wanted me to do seat myself or did they seat me. The staff was really friendly but really slow took forever. I ordered Spicy Noodles spice level 4 it was pretty hot good flavor it came with a spring roll really good but the salad it came with was just ok. I will give this place another try really good lunch prices."}
{"text":"I was craving Thai like no other today (go figure) after passing Tipps 88 in Tempe while running errands. Seeing that it's closed on Sundays (thanks Gabi!) I convinced a friend (okay it didn't take any convincing at all) to head to Swaddee in our continuing search for best Thai food in Phoenix.

Swaddee is hidden away in the corner of a plaza, but the inside decor does not disappoint. It's not too large and not too small. Rather, it's just the right size. The tables were simple. We had a one with a black cloth, an image centered in the middle, and a glass overlay but I was completely drawn to it. 

We started our meal with the small portion of Tom Ka with chicken and it was amazing. Some of the best I've had. It had the right amount of spices and flavor as well as the right amount of heat. My main course was the pineapple curry (medium), which was just as incredible. It was a little hotter than medium, which was perfect and full of flavor. The shrimp were huge and delicious and the pineapple was fresh. For dessert, my friend ordered the coconut ice cream and I ordered the golden banana (banana and coconut in a spring roll). We ended up each taking half the banana and opening it like a spring roll and putting ice cream on top. Hands down this is one of the best desserts I've ever had. Even if you dine alone at Swaddee, you *have* to order both. I'm not going to lie. I might come back here just for dessert. 

I'm glad to have finally found another Thai restaurant other than Malee's I can call home!"}
{"text":"Changed name to Cha Da Thai.... same great food"}
{"text":"It all started back in June 2016 when my wife and I had just conquered Humphreys up in Flag and needed a good place to get our grub on. We came across Swaddee Thai up there and loved the food so much we knew we had to check out the other location which was coincidentally right in our backyard. Fast forward and when it came to my wife's birthday, she requested Thai so we knew exactly where to go! The food was just as delicious as the location up north. The Pad Thai was just the right amount of spicy. The Tom Kah soup was downright heavenly (I could've gone for another bowl myself!). The service was fantastic and really homey--made you feel like you were in a Thai family's home kitchen! Needless to say, birthday dinner was a great success.

Oh and I can't forget about that Thai iced tea! But I definitely recommend ordering it to be served with your main dishes, as it will be waaay too tempting to drink it all before your food arrives if they serve it first."}
{"text":"Pierre, with comments like that i have no choice LOL 

Swaddee is OK. See, there i did not say it sux or not worth it. You happy now? LOL ;)

Yeah, its alright. Been there bunch of times for lunch from work and once for dinner. Dinner was better. Lunch is fine. Do not believe their star rating, 5 will NOT burn your eyes out. 

Now, is it best Thai ever? Noup, it aint. Is it best in the neighborhood? MAYBE! However is you are willing to go a few miles West into Foothills you will find Thai Basil which i think quite a bit better. 

Now, there we have it. Efff me and my effing opinions :)

\"Its awight\"

{"text":"I haven't been to this place in a while-- I was contracting at Intel and this was a nice spot to hit for lunch, so I went several times over the course of 3 months, and from a convenience standpoint it certainly had a great taste-to-distance ratio.

There were basically two minuses that subtracted from my experience there.

First, maybe because they are catering to a business lunch crowd that isn't familiar with more authentic Thai seasonings or-- well, I don't really know-- their food tended to be overly sweet.  The pad thai was very sweet, such that someone I brought there for lunch was almost unable to finish it.  The yellow curry (one of my favorites) was also cooked such that the curry itself was discolored, with brown flecks-- I was told by another Thai cook that this is from over-cooking some part of the mix, but I'm afraid I can't help past there (though it did not taste burned and it didn't actually taste bad, it just tasted \"off\").

Second, this is the second location as far as I know and it definitely lacked some atmosphere.  It felt more like a generic restaurant with some Thai decor thrown in for good measure.  The first location is a little bit more quaint, and the people working there seemed slightly more relaxed-- since that first location is not in the same sort of business-centric area, it's entirely possible that the faster pace of this second location is just part of doing business.

Anyway, for a quick Thai lunch in the Chandler area it's not a bad choice at all.  I just think if you're looking for a serious Thai meal, that this one strays a tad too much from authenticity."}
{"text":"Our go to for Thai. The service can be a bit off but the food is delicious. Definitely try the Phad Thai which comes with beef, chicken, and shrimp. You get to choose your spice level - even their medium is pretty hot! Also the crab puffs and orange chicken dish are delicious."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and the staff always recognizes me. I enjoy the food and the presentation is lovely. On 2/12, my fianc√© and I decided to stop in for dinner. We were given these adorable coconut desserts on the house. They were made for Valentine's Day and were delicious."}
{"text":"This has to be the best Thai food around. I have tried a few other places, but none are as authentic and delicious as Swaddee. We are now regulars and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Always think of this place first when I am in the mood for Thai. Consistently good and friendly. You choose the level of spiciness (from 1 mild to 5 hot). I usually go with #3 and have sweat dripping from my forehead and I usually pick the Pad Thai. Pretty decent portion sizes and a good selection of vegetarian options as well."}
{"text":"Swaddee was decent. I had the red curry chicken lunch special ($7.95) and tom kha gai soup ($6.95). I got the order to go and it was packaged well, all ready to go when I came in to pick it up. The lunch special includes a generous portion of curry, a mound of white rice, salad, and a tiny little egg roll. The egg roll had a ton of wrapping with a small amount of filling. The rice was very slightly crunchy tasting in some parts. The red curry was lighter and a little sweeter tasting than other versions I've had and was watery. The salad had a peanut dressing on it which tasted decent.

The tom kha gai was also a sizeable portion of soup, filled with chicken and vegetables. The soup was actually thicker than the curry, and had a strong sour flavor. 

Service was friendly and polite at the counter.

I asked for both dishes 4 out of 5 in terms of spiciness but they turned out more like mild/medium say like 2-3 level to me. 

Overall they have good portions and friendly service but the food is about average."}
{"text":"This is my first experience with Thai food and I am absolutely hook. I wish there was a location closer."}
{"text":"After 2 years of listening to my bf tell me he was going to take me here I took matters into my own hands and figured out this is the place he was talking about. We came in around 2 and ordered my bfs favorite papaya salad, Tom Yum soup, sweet and sour fish and 2 Thai teas. 

Meh. It wasn't bad, but I've had better. Our bill was $40, a little pricey, especially since the first two were only appetizers."}
{"text":"I used to rate this restaurant at 5 stars, but lately the quality has seriously declined.  I am officially on the hunt for a new favorite Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"Not very familiar with Thai food. Tried the Pad See Iwe with chicken and #4 spicy. AWESOME!"}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food!  We got take out.  The Pad Thai and Curry - excellent!  If you like medium spicy...choose #2 (spicy between 1-5).  #3 spicy...was way too hot for my husband....who is always medium spicy.  
FYI...they DO NOT take AMEX; and there is a 10% discount if you pay with cash!"}
{"text":"Always a winner.  We have gone here approx 10 times in the past year.  The food is good quality, nice staff and service.  A consistent good place to eat."}
{"text":"My boyfriend has been talking about this place since I've known him and today when we were weeding in the yard something smelled like green curry (I know this sounds weird, but this is how my brain works, don't ask) and that was it, I had the bug, I needed Thai food. The lady who greeted us was very nice, and was the same person who served us and cashed us out for that matter. Decor was fairly standard for a Thai food place, including the compulsory fish tank right in the middle of the room. My boyfriend had his absolute favorite Pad See Ew. Which he enjoyed as always. I had the Green Curry with chicken. We both opted for the 1 star spiciness, I think the server laughed at that, but c'mon, I'm Finnish and French-Canadian here lady, my palate is not made for Thai spice! It was the perfect amount of spicy for me, and that good, creamy, warm green curry flavor. The vegetables were perfectly cooked so they still had that crunch. Maybe it was because I wasn't paying, or maybe it's because I've been desensitized by East Coast prices but I thought that $24+tip for the amount of food that we got was perfectly reasonable. I think it's a solid place. 

Sidenote: I see that most people have responded \"No\" for delivery, however on their website, for this location it says \"Call and ask about free delivery\" so I don't know if it's new, or just lesser known."}
{"text":"Can't get any more authentic thai food then swaddee.   I've been coming here for years and they always have been consistent with their flavor and portions.  Inexpensive place to have lunch and a great place for dinner."}
{"text":"I had read positive reviews about Swaddee Thai being one of the best Thai restaurants in Phoenix and was excited to finally have an opportunity for a visit.  I recently moved slightly closer to Swaddee, and a visit seemed inevitable, in part, due to the location in a strip mall next to Zoyo.  Overall, it was okay.  We entered a little after five and were the only patrons.   A few guests joined us and there seemed to be a few to go orders.  Our waitress was Thai and accommodating to my family's dietary proclivities.  The food was entirely unremarkable. My green curry, the dish I eat always order and use to judge all Thai restaurants, was watery and bland.  My wife was in full agreement with my tepid evaluation.  My daughter didn't seem particularly excited either."}
{"text":"This place was good. There was a lot of food to choose from off of the lunch menu and their portion size were huge! They have you choose how spicy you want your food to be by rating it from 0-5. 5 being super spicy. I ordered pad Thai with chicken and picked number 2. It was very flavorful and so delicious!"}
{"text":"Food from here is very good! As someone who is in a family that doesn't like spicy things, Swaddee does a great job of making something not spicy when asked. I love their pad thai, pad se iew, thai fried rice and mee krob. Only wish there was more veggies in the pad se iew."}
{"text":"Went with the reviews to try this place out. The location is easily accessible the ambiance is nice but nothing fancy. 
Drinks: Thai coffee 4*
Appetizer : Chicken Satay 2.5*, personally i felt that taste was ok and chicken was not cooked tender 
Entree : Drunken noodles 
The quantity was really good. Its good i stick with the spice level of 3/5. If you don't eat spice stick with 2 :). I have tried drunken noodles at many thai places so the taste here felt little low, color of the dish reflected something was missing in it. I will surely rate this dish higher on some other Thai places. 
Overall if you are near this place and want to try thai not a bad choice :)."}
{"text":"I love spicy thai food and Swaddee certainly didnt let me down. I feel like this is a great hidden gem in Chandler, I would have never known it was there unless it had been pointed out to me. I have had a few favorites like green curry and pad thai here and they are all delicious."}
{"text":"So we ordered again - take out, again, and we had the pad thai (with everything, and extra egg) and the snow peas and mushrooms. I asked for pad thai noodles with my snow peas  and mushrooms, but they would not stir fry them together - so they charged me for a side.  Aside from being a bit overpriced, the delivery was fine.  And really, really fast...order to delivered was 23 minutes!"}
{"text":"I ordered a pick up order for the first time after hearing about their good food from some friends. The woman on the phone sounded beyond rude and still gave her the benefit of the doubt. 
When I went to pick up my order she didn't even bother to say hi or anything. She talked as if she was annoyed. When I paid, she gave me both receipts with my card, slammed a pen in front of me to sign a receipt and left. I was standing there with a signed receipt, a pen upset. She was too busy sitting down at a table and talking to another server. Then a guy saw it, came to me running and said thank you and took care of it. Such an unacceptable behavior. Totally ruined my day. Food tasted good, but for some reason gave me a stomachache. Never going back to be treated so terribly."}
{"text":"This place was packed with corporate power lunch peeps! Right when we sat down, they brought us salad - I love instant munchables. We had the Tom Ka Gong (shrimp?) soup with a level four spiciness. Now, I have a really really high spice tolerance, and a level four knocked my socks off! I was weeping with hot chili joy (eek - bad description, but you get the point!). The soup had a small amount of coconut in it, but was not heavy and rich where you cannot eat anything else. I chose the red curry chicken from the lunch menu at a level 3 spiciness - that was a perfect amount of heat for me! Even though the place was packed, our food came quickly and was piping hot. Great experience! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Overall I enjoyed the food, service and atmosphere here, but they fell short of 4 stars for me.

We were served in somewhat of a tag-team style, there were probably 3-4 different people waiting on us.  I thought that was a bit unusual.  The staff was friendly if a bit aloof.  We did have a spill at our table (yes it was me again, but no drinking was involved this time) which they could have handled better.

We had Pad Thai and an appetizer sampler-I forget what that was called.  The Pad Thai was heavily flavored and the sauce was kind of heavy.  I prefer a lighter sauce for the Pad Thai-it should not be a heavy dish like Alfredo.  The apps were good, particularly the Satay.  The Spring Rolls were overly oily.

I consider the prices here to be a bit high for Thai food as I've had so much great Thai food for very reasonable prices.  If I'm paying 12 bucks for a noodle dish it had better be excellent, not just good."}
{"text":"We were craving food from this place so badly the other night that I drove all the way from South Phoenix to Chandler to pick some up! The food was ready just a few minutes after I got there, and they must have packaged it *really* well (or made it super hot) because it was still hot when I got home 30 minutes later. We didn't try anything new (just the Pad Thai and duck curry, our favorites from last time), but it was just as delicious. The only change I made was ordering our curry \"5\" (on the 1 to 5 spiciness scale) - it was definitely hot but not as hot as we would get in the Bay Area when we asked for spicy. Can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Had cashew chicken, coconut princess, and Tom yan soup - all quite good , with good service"}
{"text":"excellent atmosphere and authenticate Thai cuisine. spice level on food is always a bit skewed in Arizona i ordered Thai Fried Rice with star rating of 4 out of 5 and for me it was more like a 2. non the less flavor was right on point."}
{"text":"Do not eat here! I jus picked up take out and there is a small cock roach in my soup. I have never had this happen before."}
{"text":"Found this hidden gem, of course on Yelp! 

Authentic Thai food with lots of Thai tradition decorations  around this restaurant.

We felt a bit overwhelmed from all the different items on the menu!

The descriptions made everything sound so good.

It was 4 girls total and we shared everything. We ordered the Tom Kha hot pot #25, Pad See Ew Chicken #65, Thai BBQ chicken #31, and Papaya Salad #14.

It was all very appetizing. Everything had the right amount of spice. We were very satisfied. The spice is out of a 5 and majority of the dishes were 3-4. Next time I'll try the 5 to see how spicy it is.

The service was a 3 out of 5 stars. He took our order and went about his way. Refilled our water frequently. 

I'm glad I found another Thai restaurant to put on my go to's!"}
{"text":"The soup is great as well as their tropical fried rice.  My wife got the cold beef salad which was tasty but the meat was a little chewy.  Great service and the atmosphere is nice."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Always on time, fresh, and consistent.  I've tried other Thai places in the area and this is by far my favorite.  Every time I am in the Phoenix area I stop in here."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get thai and I have not found a place to rival it.

Now it's not perfect.  I got on a regular basis (they know me when I walk in now... I go that much).  The service is either great or slow, and the heat ratings varies enough that you can be surprised.  The decor isn't fancy and it's hard to find from the street.

Now that being said, the food is always great and across multiple dishes on the menu.  I'm always satisfied with my lunch.  

It gets busy every week day during lunch because of the Intel crowd so show up before noon.  For dinner and the weekends, it's never that busy, so a great time to go if you have time."}
{"text":"Pickup is the way to go and pay with cash for the 10% discount. To feed 8 folks for takeout it was ~$116 with plenty for left overs. The items we ordered and all enjoyed were:

-Tom Kha soup (light sour curry with veggies)
-Spicy eggplant (served with ground beef and jalapenos, spicy got a level 2)
-2 orders of pad thai with chicken
-Pad see ew (thicker noodles with egg, level 2 with pork)
-Cashew chicken (very saucy, just needed a little more cashews)
-2 orders of crab puffs served with sweet and sour

There are a lot of Thai places in Chandler but this is a good spot for lunch and takeout."}
{"text":"Simply the best Thai food I've had anywhere, and I'm quite the culinary Asiaphile... I've been all over California, tried a lot of Thai dishes, and simply haven't found it's equal. The pla rhad prik (catfish in red curry) is probably the best thing I've eaten, ever. 'Nuff said."}
{"text":"Been there three times, and have tried out different dishes.

First time i got pad thai, omg, that food was sooooooooooo greasy and salty, but i swore that i was not going back there again. 

But my coworker wants to go there for lunch and said the curry was good, so i went back again. This time i had the green curry with beef, it was pretty decent, flavorful yet not too strong. however, the veggie inside is a little bit more chewy that i would have prefer.

Then we went back again for lunch, this time i had the noodles, ca'n't remember what it is called. it is those very thin and transparent one. It was really good. i ordered 4/5 spiciness, but still not too spicy. 

So basically it might be a hit or a miss, and it is not super spicy so if you are looking for that you might be disappointed;. overall a decent lunch spot."}
{"text":"Amazing service and wonderful, flavorful cuisine. We love both the lunch and dinner menu. This is a quaint, affordable restaurant, and I would highly recommend it when searching for delicious Thai food."}
{"text":"OK for lunch specials but a little pricey for entrees.

Their food is decent.  I've never had a bad experience here.  After spending time in Thailand I feel I may have ruined it for myself trying to find good Thai in Arizona.  I like their fried rice dishes, but if you don't get the lunch special they will run you about $11, which, IMO, is steep.  $7.95 will get you soup / salad and an entree of choice for lunch."}
{"text":"The food is the best Thai food ever, the weekday customer was great but at weekend customer service was horrible, unprofessional, there is one waitress at weekend, she act like hated me for no reason the first time I met her, my husband who is not very sensitive, he was like omg that girl hates you and she won't want to talk to me or even look at me even i was smiling and really nice to her everytime, she just can't be friendly to me only , Idk it's because I'm Asian, and she is asian or I looked like someone she knew?! Regardless, it was super unprofessional and uncomfortable. But the food is so good, and the place is really clean, owner were very nice."}
{"text":"I went here last week with a friend after waffling between here and Thailicious. Full disclaimer? Thailicious is better, but they have better deals here. They have dinner specials for about 9$ that comes with a salad with peanut dressing, an entree and a spring roll...not a bad deal. Also, the portion is large, I had more than enough for lunch the next day (and the flavors were better the next day too). I had the spicy noodles at a 3.5 heat level and it was spicy, but not burning my face off. My friend had the pad se ew and she thought it was ok... nothing special. At the end, we wanted to try the raved about coconut ice cream, but they brought our check without asking about dessert and promptly disappeared... so that was that. This probably wouldn't be my first choice of Thai in the area, but I would go back. 

PS When I walked in, I almost had a heart attack because they had an ATM sitting there... is this place cash only?!?! Oh no!.... No, they do take cards...phew!"}
{"text":"Just stopped in 2:45 with a very hungry child who was craving pad thai. The staff basically said they will be closing in 2 minutes. They refused service to us.
I guess they had places to go.
Didn't even offer us take out
We obviously  will never go again"}
{"text":"It's taken me a while to find an authentic, tasty Thai food place in Arizona and now I have!!

Swaddee in Chandler is the real deal, using traditional flavor combinations that take me back to the beaches of Phuket every time. I've come to learn that a Thai place that has duck on the menu is usually worth the price, and Swaddee does not disappoint! Their curry duck is rich and succulent. Likewise, their Garlic Eggplant w/ tofo is a family standard for us. Additionally, the staff is fun and friendly, even during high volume times!

TIP: If you plan to go for the usual M-F lunch, there is a hefty wait. Deal with it or go elsewhere. There's a reason for it! 

ALSO: Swaddee offers a 10% discount if you pay CASH!

 Swaddee!"}

My husband and I LOVE this restaurant. Really laid back atmosphere, good service,  and great thai food. While many Asian restaurants flood the Chandler area, this spot has a loyal following and for good reason."}
{"text":"How does this place have 4 star reviews??

The food isn't that great and staff isn't friendly either. They take so much time to serve! The other Thai restaurants in the area are way better."}
{"text":"This is a authentic Thai food.  The service and food were amazing   No one will be disappointed  excellent waitress who spoke Thai to our veteran who served there   We highly recommend tempura shrimp   Yum"}
{"text":"Walking in, I guess it was a bad sign when we only saw 1 person there.  Service was prompt but a bit gruff.  Lunch special ordered with decent sized portions but mediocre taste.
La's Thai at 
15050 N Northsight Blvd
Scottsdale, AZ 85260
 is way better."}
{"text":"I've only had the Som Tam (Green Papaya Salad) with a coors light.  The best.  Atmosphere is cozy, and waitstaff is nice."}
{"text":"Favorite Thai restaurant in the valley and I eat alot of Thai. Their fried rice and Tom yum soup are second to none. Would go there more but it's a drive from where I live."}
{"text":"Best pad Thai and Tom kha soup in town and it never disappoints. We figured out that to get the pad Thai spice level to our liking, we have to specifically ask them \"spice level 4 with added fresh chilis\" but be careful because it's super spicy with fresh chilis. The tom kha soup is always spicy and the perfect balance of sour, spicy, creamy. Our favorite Thai restaurant for sure and we've been to almost all"}
{"text":"It is ok, nothing fantastic.  Definitely not the best thai food, but it would work in a bind.  Very average."}
{"text":"Last night was my first visit to Swaddee.  

I really like the fish tank in the center of the dining room. It reminds me of a restaurant I loved as a child.  I found myself staring at the fish in the tank throughout my meal. 

I ordered the Pad Thai at a \"level 5,\" but I was sure to explain I wanted it EXTRA hot.  She seemed to understand I meant ACTUALLY hot, not wimpy person hot. 

I also ordered a Thai Iced Tea.  It was fabulous.  

My pad thai was HUGE and delicious. I did end up adding a few more spoonfuls of red chili paste, but I initially underestimated the heat level. It did build up on me!  Did I mention the portion size was HUGE?!  After eating far more than I should have eaten, I had an entire styrofoam container of food left over.  Yeah. It was that big. 

The service was great.  The ladies working there were friendly.  On the way out, I noticed one of the ladies was rolling the spring rolls by hand on a table.  She had lots to make.  They were all perfect and uniform in size. It was funny because at dinner I was talking about how perfect my grandfather made lumpia. It was just like that!  

I will return to Swaddee... soon!"}
