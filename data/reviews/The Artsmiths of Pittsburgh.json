{"text":"This new/relocated business opened just last week, and it is everything I had hoped it would be. If you're familiar with Liberty Ave. in Mt. Lebanon, no doubt you passed by or even stopped into Kool Kat Designs, a tiny store with locally made jewelry and artwork. Artsmiths of Pittsburgh is the new incarnation of that now defunct business. They're now located in \"the barn\", a huge space that was once Rollier's Hardware, and then a hobby store in its last life. It's a perfect location for them, as they now have enough space to truly showcase the beautiful art, jewelry and textiles that people enjoy looking at and buying. All of the offerings here are created by local artists, which is another great reason to support them. They even have a roomy cafe where you enjoy a cup of coffee, pastry or lunch. As of his writing, they are still working on the lower floor of the building, so there will more to come, such as classes and perhaps even live music. This is a wonderful place to buy that one of a kind gift for someone special, and you get to feel good about if too, as you'll be supporting a truly local business."}
{"text":"Awesome place to browse for some really cool local finds!  Don't be intimidated that it's a local art gallery and shop, they truly have items for every budget! I checked out everything from art prints, to jewelry, to finer jewelry, to home decor, greeting cards, Pittsburgh memorabilia, pottery, health and beauty items, outdoor sculptures, you name it! And I didn't even check out the downstairs gallery.  Everything was so neat and all of great quality, this isn't a place with your child's artwork or granny's crocheted. They house some really cool stuff by some really talented people. They also have a card in each artist's area with a little bit about them and where they are from (a nice touch).  The lady at the register also told me that they hold art classes downstairs, and today when I visited, it was a mosaic class in particular.  If you are an art lover, a person who likes unique things, or need a present for a loved one that has everything, I encourage you to check out this shop. It is a great way to support both a local business AND a local artist! :)"}
{"text":"This is such a neat space!  Half of it is photography and paintings. The other half is jewelry, accessories, kitchen items, Pittsburgh themed t-shirts, and the list goes on. Normally my eyes are drawn to jewelry but there are some amazing tables that I fell in love with. They were tools welded together and then welded to a metal frame and topped with a sheet of glass. That's why I love shopping in places like this-you never know what you will find or what might catch your eye.  They also have a neat little cafe which hosts speakers every Thursday from 1-2pm. They are also putting in some new things down stairs.  I really enjoyed browsing and you will too."}
{"text":"Exactly what boutique should be.   This store represents the craftsman of great art and fabulous products that make this city great.   They have beautiful handmade jewelry and painted canvases and clothing.   AND THEN there is a vast array of Pittsburgh representative items. But they're not the touristy black and gold things you're used to seeing. These are clever and well thought out works of art.   It's so worth a stop. This big barn is right next to Atria's on Beverly Rd. And they have a coffeeshop, too!"}
{"text":"So stoked to have this place in my hood! It's just what the area needed. A quirky gift shop with a coffee shop inside. I've already visited twice, hosting a meeting at the coffee shop and also dropping in for a last minute housewarming gift.   The gift shop is the larger part of the building, with all local art, sculptures, jewelry... you name it, a local artist probably made it and it's here! I think they feature over 200 some artists. I picked up a cool drawing of Oakland and the Cathedral of Learning for a Pitt grad and it was a great gift (and already hanging up in their house!).   The coffee shop is exciting because we really needed a local spot. I'm excited to see where they're headed with it because they have the space and some great local resources. When I visited it smelled like they were making some delicious panini's. They also had some different side options to dig into.   I'm interested to see if they add a coffee bar, because right now it's only drip coffee and no specialty bar drinks. As a tea drinker I was a little bummed to see they only had a small selection of random boxed tea. I hope they'll carry a local joint (Yay Gryphon's Tea) or at least have more of a selection of loose leaf teas.   Looking forward to popping in for lunch and of course shopping again soon!"}
