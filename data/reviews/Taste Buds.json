{"text":"Came with the girlfriend to order some stewed chicken. 

One thing to note - the food here really packs flavour! The stewed chicken is fall-off-the-bone and is very well seasoned! The cole slaw is well-mixed, though doesn't have a dressing to it. I prefer it this way to be honest. The rice and peas tastes like it was cooked with coconut milk it's surprisingly refreshing. 

The large came out to just over $10 but will really fill you up! The portions are generous and you get a lot of chicken for the price you pay. 

P.S. Be sure to ask for some oxtail gravy too!"}
{"text":"This place was a referal from a friend and heard the food was good so I figured I would check it out. When I entered I noticed the place is very clean and not hard to find. I was treated with great courtesy and food was fresh and hot will be back again soon."}
{"text":"In a quiet, mostly residential neighbourhood. I'm assuming they're relying on word of mouth, because there isn't too much traffic along the street.

The place has very limited seating with no washroom, so mostly takeout or dinning solo. The service was a bit unenthusiastic but at least functional.

With all that said, I just had time for a quick lunch. Though it was fairly quiet when I came in, the food was still quite fresh. The fried chicken was very good and I would return in a heartbeat when back in the same area. No complaints with the rice and peas and of course made even better by the requested oxtail gravy on top."}

Taste Buds is a takeout counter located in a Meadowvale neighbourhood plaza.  The food is West Indian, in particular Jamaican.  So roti won't be dalpuri.

Rice & Peas, Coleslaw (fresh, not drenched in dressing), Jerk Chicken, Oxtail, & Fried Chicken were good.  I only tried the Jerk Chicken which was moist and flavourful.  

The male who took our order was apathetic, but when one of my friends ordered the Fried Chicken, his face lit up and he seemed quite proud of it, saying it was better than \"Popeye's\" or \"KFC\".  Nothing was too salty which I normally find with West Indian takeout.

Small was ~$8 and just good for 1 serving.  Large is ~$13/13.50.  I can't give this place 5*s, even though the food is good because the owners didn't bother changing the prices on the menu.  Change this and it's all good, but 3-3.5/5 for now."}
