{"text":"First of all the food is delicious.  Ariel is an excellent employee.  Mari is a very good cook. visit this restaurant and you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Delicious! I had the vegetarian combo and a side of rice. Staff was very friendly and accommodating! Definitely will be returning"}
{"text":"I love this place I go here at least once a week. I always get the lamb gyro with garlic feta fries. The garlic feta fries are my favorite part of the meal. I also like that they have combination meals. Gyro, choice of side and a soda. I also love that Yanni's is a family owned restaurant. I would highly recommend eating here."}
{"text":"They have moved their location from Eastern & Silverado to Maryland and Silverado. Not too far from its original location.  I've eaten at Yanni's Gyros twice now. Both times being EXCELLENT.  The prices are a little expensive but you pay for what you get, right?! I got the chicken kabob plate. It comes with two chicken kabobs, basmati/orzo rice and a side salad. I LOVE THE RICE!! It is sooo delicious! A little bit oily but full of flavor! This plate is pricey about $12.95 for everything but you do get a lot of food.  My boyfriend got a gyro combo. It comes with a gyro with choice of meat, a drink and a side. Choices of sides were hummus, dolmas, babaganoush, fries (or greek fries) and I think that was it. I had my boyfriend get the dolmas! The first time I got it, the rice was a little warm, which made me think they were freshly made.   I always see the same man, who I'm thinking is the owner. He is very friendly and nice."}
{"text":"What you don't find in many restaurant but you find at Gyros is not only the freshness but true authentic food. It hits home every time I go. Look forward to my next visit.   My favorite is the Gyros Chicken Platter with the amazing fries and when it's cold you must try the soup."}
{"text":"Terrible food and terrible service. The owner was very rude. I ordered chicken gyro plates to go. What they gave me was not chicken and it smelled really bad, like they were trying to get rid of some old meat at the end of the night. I took the food back and asked for a refund and the owner blamed me and started yelling at me while I was holding my baby in my arms. He refused to refund my money."}
{"text":"Workers we nice and patient and let me tell you, they have the best pita gyro!! And order the garlic Frita fries!!! You'll thank me if you do!!!!"}
{"text":"some of the worst gyro meat I have ever had.  the fresh veggies and good sauce saved it"}
{"text":"It was my 1st time at yannis. It was great. Loved the gyro and the garlic feta fries are wonderful. It was reasonably priced and the ppl tht wrk there are nice. I strongly suggest this place."}
{"text":"I love this place, the only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it is slightly overpriced but they do give you really large portions. I have been coming to Yanni's since they first came to this location, they are so friendly. I always get the Lamb Gyro Combo with the garlic feta fries YUM! I love it!!"}
{"text":"I may not be Greek but I've had my fair taste in the food and this spot knows what they're doing.   It's nice little corner store in the Smiths shopping plaza with a good amount of character and a staff that makes sure the place is clean and comfortable.  I've only had the lamb based entrees as I found it to be full of flavor and a lot of heart put into the food, the Greek fries, hummus, pita bread, salads, and even the baklava were full of heart and flavor.  I try and stop in here when ever I can the cost can add up quick here but the food always leaves me feeling full of life."}
{"text":"The food and service is exceptional. They offer a military discount, which is very nice. Decent prices and good value. I recommend."}
{"text":"Yannis is great quick Greek food. I haven't had a bad meal here yet and I've been coming in since they opened. Everyone that works here is incredibly nice and helpful. I would recommend them to any of my friends!"}
{"text":"The feta fries are insane! I love them and crave them. I don't live on this side of town anymore, so whenever I'm around I try to make a stop. The gyros are great too."}
{"text":"Food is great and Yanni, the owner, is too.  I couldn't tell you what to order as I get just a plate of Gyro meat with a side salad. It's not on the menu and Yanni always remembers what I order.    One of my lunch time favorites!!"}
{"text":"I have had many a gyro, and I can safely say Yanni's is fantastic.  The ingredients are fresh and delicious.  I have to agree with some other folks here, while the \"fries\" in the garlic fries are not themselves outstanding, when i discover upon opening that it's been PRE-SMOTHERED in buffalo sauce and feta you have won my vote hands down.  Well-played!  The hummus is not the best I have ever had, but it's pretty darn good!"}
{"text":"I had to contribute to what I thought was a place that does not deserve the stigma of a 3.5 star review. For gyros in Las Vegas, this easily earns 4 stars. We ordered takeout and I had the chicken gyro. Even with the short drive, it was still delicious, as if I ordered it straight from the restaurant. The veggies were crisp and fresh, which alone warrants positive points in the desert valley. The seasonings tasted authentic and the meat was tender and juicy. In a perfect world, the price tag would be a little lower, but for what you get it is worth it."}
{"text":"Really good gyro. The chicken was all white meant. Flavor was great. The taziki sauce on it was great. I had it with a side of fries. They were good to. Fresh not greasy.  Will go back and try more items."}
{"text":"So amazing!!  Been here 3 times this week and if my husband wasn't sick of Greek food, we'd go a 4th time!!  We've eaten hummus, lamb Gyros, falafal, baklava, Gyro plate, spanakopita, garlic feta fries - all absolutely amazing!!  I can't wait to try everything on the menu. It's not expensive in my opinion - we order all of the food above and it only costs about $30, and it's enough to feed 3 people! Portions are huge in my opinion.   Assad is the guy who takes our order and he is so sweet.  I'm shocked at other reviewers who said the staff is rude and unhelpful.  Assad always answers my questions about the food (I love Greek food but I'm no expert) and laughs because I can't pronounce most of it lol.  Place is always clean and smells amazing!!  We get better service here than at some of the most expensive restaurants on the Strip. I Absolutely recommend trying this place!!"}
{"text":"I've now eaten here a couple of times, the first time having the gyro with Greek fries and the second time with the gyro platter with salad.   The food is good and they get it out to you hot and fresh.   It may be a little pricey but its well worth the money."}
{"text":"I went here it was pretty good. They ran out of beef and gave me a mix plate and it was good. So was the greek salad. It tasted a lot like the whole foods greek salad only a bit cheaper which is nice.   I'll come back here again for sure."}
{"text":"Oner, Winner or Try again ???   My first experience was this was a WINNER.  Sandwich was as tasty as other plaves but the Feta fries were a great touch.  There was a good selection of other sides too.  Menu had good range of more main items to try so will be back to do so.  Good job Yannis.  I recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for Sunday lunch.  We had the gyro combo (your choice of gyro on traditional pita or in a tortilla). We chose to get it on a pita because gyro on a tortilla just didn't sound right. For the combo you also get a drink & your choice of side which I appreciate because most Greek places have you buy your sides separately. Options include regular fries, garlic feta fries, hummus, salad, soup and more!  The Greek garlic feta fries were delicious! The sauce is addicting! Wish the gyro meat were thicker... here it's sliced like deli meat. It was still really good though. Even our 2 year old loved it! Only drawback is slow service. Will be back when the craving for Greek hits."}
{"text":"I stopped by Yanni's recently on my adventures to Smith's.  The place is lacking some style but the Lamb Gyro I had made up for it.    I ordered the Lamb Gryo platter with fresh Hummus and warm pita chips on the side.  Unlike another review here, I thought the Hummus and pita chips were delicious.  I have simple tastes and this hit the spot perfectly.    When the Gyro came out a few minutes later, it was nicely presented and tasted like what a traditional gyro should taste like.  The ingredients seemed fresh and had plenty of flavor.  The price was about $12.00 for the whole meal.  Not too shabby considering the amount of food I received plus drink.  All in all, it was a decent lunch with crazy music on in the background. :)"}
{"text":"The gyro pita was ok. Not a lot of flavor, though. We also had the chicken pita which my girl said was pretty good. The fries were super and the babaganoush was interesting. Great service."}
{"text":"This place was terrible.  They got the order completely wrong....the items itself were right but everything we had requested (no cheese, etc) was completely wrong.  The gyros here are frozen.  It was basically like a Steak'm.  Beyond gross.  I would avoid this if you are craving Greek."}
{"text":"My friend took me to this place because I was craving Greek food and its really hard to find a good place. Wow this place is delicious! Its a family owned place and the family is so so nice. Very cozy little joint. I got the traditional gyro with lamb w/ french fries and my friend got the gyro with chicken and baba ganoush with warm pita for dipping. When they brought us our food my eyes just about bugged out of my head, such a big serving! Everything tasted amazing and I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"This is a GREAT place for gyros! They look and taste better than any advertisement you've ever seen. They also have awesome sides, the hummus is to die for served with warm, fresh pita bread. You can tell everything is home made here and made to order."}
{"text":"Yanni's is one of our favorite restaurants.  Also, the owner Yanni is always helpful.  My personal favorite dish is the Lamb Gyro Salad.  It comes with warm pita great that is always delicious.  I am looking forward to trying more dishes there soon."}
{"text":"I was there for the first time today at the advice of a friend. I had the Gyro and my friend had a salad. The meals were delicious and I will certainly be back."}
{"text":"I was craving a gyro the other day and stopped here on the way home. It was my first time here. I ordered the lamb gyro. I don't know what it was but something was missing from it. It was okay but definitely not flavorful. The staff was very friendly which makes me want to come back here and try other things from the menu."}
{"text":"Wow can't believe there's bad reviews!! People are crazy. This spot is awesome! Nice family owned. They're super nice and the gyro, let me tell you! It's the best. The only one Ive had close to it is the Greek bistro on marks st. Also the pita bread and hummus is great. I'm yet to try more things!"}
{"text":"The gyro was decent and filling. I didn't find it to be as good as some reviews indicate, but to each their own. It was fairly busy on our visit so I expected a wait, but it was about 30 minutes before we received our food. Far too long in my opinion."}
{"text":"Mmmmmmmmm I love the garlic fries and the salad and the Lamb Gryo."}
{"text":"This is such a great place to eat, the gyro is perfect and really authentic. Try the feta fries with hot sauce. They also make their own baklava."}
{"text":"Menu has changed. Prices have gone up. It's way overpriced for the atmosphere and customer service. I called in an order and was quoted 15-20 minutes. 35+ minutes later I'm still waiting for my to go order. I've frequented this establishment because it is close, the food is good and the free side with yelp check in. I won't be back. Stephano's has better customer service and is faster even though further away from me."}
{"text":"Yum!!!  Their greek chicken and rice combo plate is so good! You can takeout or eat in.  I always call in advance and it's usually ready within 10 min.  I get hummus/pita, greek salad, and the plate.  Not bad for a fast food (ish) style Greek restaurant."}
{"text":"Are they serious? Everything tasted 3 days old! Pita Bread was stale gyros heated up in a toaster oven?! Please insert throwing up emoji here."}
{"text":"First time at Yannis, sorry I waited so long to stop in. The wrap lamb Gyro is awesome, Garlic Feta fries an absolute must try, Baklava is best I had in a long time. A must try eatery!"}
{"text":"Maria rocks. The food she makes is seriously stellar and I'm constantly running in here for a Greek salad and pita and hummus. Nothing beats the prices and the service you get here. My fave to go spot."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite spot for greek food the chicken Shwarma was amazing the feta fries are very delicious and thier rice don't get me started about how great it taste overall u must try this restaurant as for me I will be here every week :)"}
{"text":"I don't understand the hype other Greek and Mediterranean restaurants wouldn't serve that  imitation lamb meat it look like steakums disguised as lamb they need to make a better effort serving Greek and Mediterranean food"}
{"text":"Legitimately one of the best restaurants I have ever eaten at. Fresh food, great service, reasonable prices and extra-late portions. I am not one to do lamb, so went with the chicken pita gyro. So darn tasty.   The Tzatziki sauce was to die for. Came with a soda and a side (I opted for hummus and pita two times I went there, and the garlic feta fries the other time). Both were tremendous. The first themselves were crisp despite being FILLED with garlic and feta. All for $10.95. Have eaten hare three times since moving from Northern California. Will be making it a semi-weekly outing from here on out."}
{"text":"I seen his place many times and I've never stop there until last night. Since I vegetarian I never know what to order in Mediterranean food. I still don't know what I ordered because they ordered for me but it was great it was filling it was decently fast and with the yelp check in we got a free hummus with pita bread. These french fries were the best friend tries I've ever had in the world!! I never ever eat fries again because I'm so burned out on them but these are amazing!!  I would literally go back just for the fries."}
{"text":"Delicious gyro salad, and my fiance loved the gyro sandwich, too.  The people here are very kind and patient, which really seals the deal."}
{"text":"I am such a fan of a place with great customer service and quality food and this place has both! The gyro's are amazing moist and full of flavor, the guy who took our order was friendly and when my fries were too spicy he remade them and even offered me a baclava on the house! It was not even their fault i was just new to the place and didn't know the sauce on the fries were hot. The place has good foot traffic and even with that the quality of svc and food is great. The resturant is nice and clean as are the bathrooms which is nice. Its nesseled in a little shopping strip infron of the smiths so sometimes on my shopping trip i stop in for a bite to eat. I would recommend anyone looking for a great gyro to check this place out"}
{"text":"This place is very very good I've gone to a couple other places around her for gyros and nothing compares to what they offer and the prices are great will definitely order again and recommend. The three cheese pie and garlic fries with hot sauce and fetaamazing"}
{"text":"The food was delicious!! Tried the lamb gyro and babaganoush. The gyro was legit!!! Good size and great flavor. Babaganoush was just ok, tasty but not the best I've had. Will def come back for that gyro again!!!"}
{"text":"I just had such a wonderful meal and experience here that I had to take my phone off the charger to post this review.  First off the owner, Baseera is absolutely delightful.  We had the pleasure of speaking with her while our food was being prepared.  We tried both, the gyro and chicken shawarma meals.  Both were delicious but I personally think the chicken shawarma was out of this world.  Talk about out of this world.. make sure you get the garlic feta fries with your combo or you will regret it.  They were honestly the best fries I've ever had and that's saying a lot!  Great place!  Excellent food (with generous portions) and a Wonderful owner!  What more could you ask for?     Five stars easy, would give them six if I could."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I finally tried this place a few months ago, and we are positively HOOKED!  The service is always spectacular. The owner treats us like family and welcomes his customers with open arms. You really feel comfortable in this restaurant! The food is always very fresh and consistently good. I'm what you would call a regular, and eat there almost every week.  The gyro meat is delicious and flavorful. My favorite item on the menu is their Lamb Gyro wrap - I get it on a whole wheat wrap. it is delicious, satisfying and filling.  The only downside is that it's a little on the pricey side, but it is worth it for the quality of food you are getting, and the excellent friendly service!"}
{"text":"Excellent Greek comfort food.  We ordered take out and love when food is all there and packed nicely. Nice experience."}
{"text":"Gyro and Feta Fries are unbelievable!!  One of my favorite places in Las Vegas.  The hummus as good and the place is never that busy."}
{"text":"Yanni's is one of my favorite Greek places to go to. Their food was wonderful, love their salads with feta cheese. The chicken was lovely and tender and great rice pilaf!"}
{"text":"Quaint little eatery with nice Mediterranean atmosphere and a cute outdoor patio area. I had the lamb kabobs with rice and pita bread. The food was delicious, and came quickly, though the place was nearly empty when I went. Had heard good things, so I thought it worth a try, and it definitely was! Not a fine dining place, but great for satisfyingly good eats."}
{"text":"I don't get the hype.. When compared to some of my favorite Greek/Mediterranean places such as the The Greak Greek, this place falls short...way short.   This is the first Greek restaurant in which I saw Tapatio sauce on every table. Maybe I am behind on a new food trend, but Tapatio sauce does not scream Greek to me, it screams \"run!\". I ordered their every day special combo consisting of the traditional gyro wrap with a side of garlic feta fries and a sparkling water for which I was charged additional $.50. After tip this came out to be around ~$15. I don't mind splurging if I feel the food and quality are worth it.  The wrap was BLAND...now I get why there was Tapatio sauce! They were so stingy with the Tzatziki Sauce and the meat had no flavor. The fries were nothing like the feta fries at The Great Greek.. they were some  weird fusion with a buffalo style sauce on them. I was starving and pregnant so I finished most of my meal..not like it tasted bad..it just didn't taste like much of anything.   The quality of the food does not warrant the prices charged. There may have been a change in ownership, because I refuse to believe that this place is an overall 4 star rated places."}
{"text":"If you want authentic Greek food, this place is where to go. Servings are huge, and the flavors are amazing. Not to mention a great staff. The garlic Feta fries are to die for. I always order the Lamb gyro plate. The salad is always fresh, the dressing not too tangy. Their rice alone is so good I could eat it by itself. The tzatziki sauce is one of the best I've ever tasted. This place continues to deliver quality food each time and never disappoints."}
{"text":"Love this place! Been coming for years. Fast service, amazing kabobs and their feta fries are to die for!!! Highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"On a budget and need some Greek? Get yourself to Yannis! The lunch combo is a gyro or wrap plus your choice of side and drink, for $11. Add in the free side with Yelp check in, and you've got yourself a feast!  The gyro itself is just okay- huge, but a bit skimpy on the tzatziki, and the lamb is in pre-cut slices rather than freshly sliced. Flavors are good though. The Greek fries inexplicably come with a mild buffalo drizzle in addition to the cheese, but they're super tasty thanks to a light garlic sauce. The dolmas though? Damn tasty, and I like how they're available warm or cold (I prefer the former).   Location is a mom-and-pop shop, with some shaded outdoor seating available. Prices are low and service is pretty friendly, would pick this over the chain Greek options in the area."}
{"text":"BEST GREEK FOOD in VEGAS!!! Everything on the menu is worth trying. You won't regret it. Their gyros are amazing! I've been to many Greek restaurants , and this is one of my favorites. You MUST TRY their GARLIC FRIES. It's the best!!!"}
{"text":"I used to eat here all the time, but I haven't been there in a while, till today. Wow, just wow how much different the food tasted from what I remember. I heard it's under new management, so that's maybe the issue. I ordered the falafel pita, hummus and fries. The fries were pretty good. The bread was ok. The hummus didn't taste like hummus. It was way too citrusy. The falafel was gross. It was definitely not freshly made and tasted like it came out of box and got microwaved. I end removing the falafel from my sandwich and just ate the veggie pita by itself. I won't be back here again."}
{"text":"Supper clean, great guest service, huge gyros! A real Greek food place not a fast food but great food. I live the garlic feta fries. Hummus is SO good. A must try and go to!"}
{"text":"Food is phenomenal ! Great customer service . Second time here and I will continue coming back for more chicken pita wraps and the yummy garlic feta fries!"}
{"text":"I have been craving a gyro for a while.  I finally tried this place after driving by it many times when they were closed.  The gyro is really good.  Greek salad is really good, and the spicy garlic fries are also really good.  Customer service is really good as well.  I may have found a new favorite spot in town for this kind of food."}
{"text":"This place has all the telltale signs of a Greek restaurant: large pictures of their food and Greece everywhere, really shitty furniture, fake plants, and that weird crosshatch fence thing. Gordon Ramsay would have a field day on kitchen nightmares, but that's how you know it's \"authentic\". The food itself is alright, it's good but I have a pretty high bar as far as gyros are concerned. This is only speaking on behalf of the gyro and side salad however. Service was quick, friendly, and concise. Def a good lunch spot."}
{"text":"First time here! The gyro plate with the garlic feta fries are the best! Love this place! Definitely coming back for more."}
{"text":"Yanni's Gyros impressed me. I ordered a Lamb Gyro and let me just say, holy sh!t that thing was f'ing huge! It was packin! I have a BIG mouth and still I was struggling. I felt like I needed to summon my inner garter snake and dislocate my jaw to eat the damn thing. It was gigantic! And YEP... That's what she said! *snicker*  So... absolutely NO ordering the gyros if you are on a first date here ladies! On second thought, that includes you men too! That is, unless you want to show off your skillz getting down and dirty with your big mouth. Small mouths need not apply! Unless, of course, you want to get all dainty and show off your badass table manners with your plastic knife and fork cuz that would be equally impressive. Haww!  Summary: Big portion size? Check. Good food? Check. Cash register lady nice? Check.  Scoreboard:  BB 1 - Gyro 0 It sure put up a good struggle but I let that thing have it!!! That thing didn't stand a chance!  My Advice: Bring your big ol' mouth and appetite over to Yanni's Gyros and they will not disappoint. Be prepared to get nickel and dimed over their yummylicious tzatziki sauce though. It's 50 cents a pop for a small plastic container of it. It is good though, like people say, and I guess they know it.   Hold tight, Yanni. It was good for me too! I'll be back for more real soon next time I am feelin the need for all that tasty Greek meat. ;)"}
{"text":"Found this place from Yelpers, and they were right (well, most of them).  We had a fantastic meal (actually 2) and it was pretty darn cheap.  I admit, I had a bit of envy when my girlfriends chicken gyro came out - but I just stole some so it worked out.  In fact, if we didn't want to try so many different restaurants we would have visited again before we left town.  This was definately the best part of staying at that part of town."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, the gyro's here are probably the best in town. It's definitely worth the money every time I go!(:"}
{"text":"Surprisingly delicious from a small, unassuming restaurant.  I had the lamb gyro and it was hands down the best gyro I've ever had.  The pita bread is fresh and soft, the dolma is a little more lemony than I am used to but it's still delicious."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place based on the reviews.  All I can say is that when you think about a gryo you think of the highly seasoned meat being sliced fresh off the spit and put into a nice warm pita.  This is not the case here.  Their meat is that generic looking pre-sliced stuff you would normally get at a school cafeteria.  Yuck.  And...the amount of meat, not that is was any good, was minimal, especially for the price.  The garlic fries were okay, more like hot sauce fries with feta than garlic fries.  Don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and each experience was good.  Their traditional gyro is awesome, and I recently tried the traditional gyro with chicken because I am on a diet.  It's not AS good as the lamb/beef but still pretty tasty.  They load it up with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and tzatziki sauce (which is a solid 4 here).  My favorite here is the garlic feta fries!  These are delicious and just very slightly spicy.  They come in a small dish but are loaded with lots of great flavors, so you don't feel jipped.  The prices are high to me for what is mostly a gyro shop so I wouldn't say it is a frequent stop on nights out, but if you want a reliably good gyro, this place can definitely do that.  I also like the décor - it's really relaxed and takes you away from the normal restaurant feel for a bit.  The pillows on the bench in the corner are comfy.  -:)"}
{"text":"The pita bread is so soft and fresh! The hummus and the traditional lamb gyros are the best!!!  Love love love this place."}
{"text":"Off of looks alone, I would have never walked in or eaten here. I'm just one of those snobs who goes off of environment and feel. Jason, said a local raved about the gyros and specially the garlic fries so we HAD to try it. No ifs ands or buts.   So walking in, I was a little put off. Stuffy. Empty. Sign on the tea machine saying out of order. No smiles or friendly hellos. No explanations of the menu as we clearly were checking it out. Personally, I like bubbly cashiers who go out of their way to ask if we are first timers or need a suggestion.   After debating, we ordered two gyros. One chicken and one lamb. One with a side of hummus and one with a side of garlic fries. We shared everything so that I could write my review with my of a variety. The chicken gyro was better than the lamb. The lab seemed tough and chicken was very tender. Good sized portions for the lunch special. The hummus was good but nothing I would rave about. The garlic fries though, wow were those tasty! Whew. I brushed my teeth twice after I got home and still could smell garlic on myself. The fries will not disappoint.   Will try again in a month or so to compare."}
{"text":"Good place to come to fullfill the gyro craving. It's a small family owned business with great service. We ordered food then say outside on the patio. In about 10 minutes, the server brought our food outside with water or our drinks.  The Gyro meat tasted good and was cooked well. I was hoping for a bit more spice on the Gyro, but it seems like they prepare their Gyro very plain- which is the typical way to cook it.   I enjoyed my lunch - wouldn't go out of my way to visit here though."}
{"text":"This is probably one of me and my boyfriends favorite greek places. My boyfriends favorite plate to get is the double chicken skewers with extra rice. And i love getting the double chicken skewer with feta fries, so delish. Asad, the owner is a great man. Very nice to sit down and talk too. He always remembers us."}
{"text":"I ordered a one kabob lamb plate for lunch. It was insanely delicious."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service!!! Some of the worst I have ever received. The manager here is extremely rude! Not only is he willing to argue with customers when he is clearly in the wrong, but he's willing to make a public spectacle of himself in front of other customers. When you make an order of food wrong, you make the right food and Apologize. You do not serve hot food cold & you most certainly don't have an attitude. I will never be back and I hope I can steer people away from here when there is amazing Greek in town with good service."}
{"text":"My favorite Greek place in Las Vegas. Everything is fresh and authentic. I highly recommend this place of you like Greek food."}
{"text":"Awful food, and very over priced! The hardest worker in the place is the microwave. The heavy guy behind the counter is rude. I wouldn't call a few packets of ketchup with your fries authentic. If you have the time, travel to marks street in Henderson, The Greek Bistro is a 1,000 times better!"}
{"text":"It's hard to find a place around town with good greek food, family owned, friendly, and clean. Yanni's Gyros had all of these things.  Very friendly people, tasty food, and most important of all, very clean.  There feta fries were pretty good, their gyros are very tasty, and a good size for the price.  The tzatziki sauce was very tasty, and one of the best I've ever had.  I will definitely be going back again.  As a professional cook I recommend this place to anyone who wants a tasty lunch."}
{"text":"Our favorite Greek spot in town. Best fries on the planet!!!"}
{"text":"This is my another favorite Greek food place. My team and I visit this place at least once a week. They are not as fast as the other Greek place I've been to but no complaints against the food. I can wait another 10 minutes for quality food.   I love their Fries and Gyro Wrap. When I want to fill my tummy, I'd go for the plates.   I'm not a big fan of their pitas or salads."}
{"text":"Very solid Greek food! A great family run place, with fresh, delicious gyro, falafel, pita, salad and souvlaki. They are always super friendly and easy to get in and out for lunch pretty quickly!"}
{"text":"I've been to Yanni's at least 6 times and it's always good for me. I love Greek food, but any place serving \"kronos\" to me is kinda lame. They don't do that ant Yanni's, although they freeze their meat it still tastes very good! I do have to say that someone wrote that the owner is weird, what does that have to do with the food?"}
{"text":"Wasn't terrible but wasn't phenomenal. The food was good, staff was friendly, pricing is terrible....id only go again if i was buying for myself only. I went with my daughter, we shared fries and both had water, she had a gyro and I had one. Ran close to $30 after tax and tip. I'll just do to-go  next time."}
{"text":"Five stars are not enough. The first thing you'll encounter is the super-friendly staff. Everyone is so nice; it's like walking into your friend's mom's kitchen when you were a kid.   The menu is clear, concise, and compact. What it doesn't tell you is that the portion size is enough to feed a hungry bear. That was a pleasant surprise.  I got the lamb gyro combo, and the dolmades. I love that they don't drown the gyro in dzadziki sauce. The meat is spiced properly, and there is a freaking ton of it.  Fantastic."}
{"text":"So freaking good! One of the best Greek restaurants in town. The garlic feta fries are seasoned perfectly, the pita and hummus are delicious and the lamb shawarma is fresh. I truly have yet to find anything I didn't like on the menu. The restaurant has a home style family vibe with friendly staff. I will for sure be back"}
{"text":"tldr  Fast, good for a quick meal but nothing crazy but you do get a free side for checking in  Get: -lamb pita gyro (no fries on the side)"}
{"text":"This place is great with good prices to boot.  Went in for a pick up of lamb wrap, garlic feta fries and grape leaves and everything was amazing.  Everything was hot, freshly prepaid and super tasty. My family on my mother's side is Greek and this is the closest thing I've had in vegas that can come close to home cooking."}
{"text":"LOVE, love, love this place! Even still after I moved. I've yet to found any place that can compare to Yanni's Gyros. I'm so proud of myself for discovering this little gem!  I'm not a big fan of lamb, but I seriously enjoy their lamb gyro. Their tzatziki sauce is so good, I always want to ask for more just to dip my gyro before every bite. They stuff their gyros with a lot of onion, that's a plus for me. And their hummus is delish! It's the best hummus I've ever had. I'm so addicted, I wished they could do shipments! I also had the pleasure of trying their garlic-feta fries, what a brilliant creation, it's a little spicy but you just can't stop eating it. I always make a pivotal stop every time I am in Vegas. They are pricey but it's money well spent.  The family are also very kind. I hope everyone continues to go here, I want to keep them in business forever!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Yanni's for a few years now. We stopped in last Saturday for dinner and I think the Falafel was the best I ever had. Mr. Yanni sold this shop and opened up a new restaurant on The Boulevard (south). They still use his name and recipes.        We redeemed a yelp offer for a free side dish, so we got the hummus. Yanni's hummus is the best in town. They make it with just the right mix of olive oil and lemon juice. The falafel and garlic fries came out hot and fresh.         The price point is a little high. $10.95 for a falafel, fries and drink, but the food lives up to the price. The reason Yanni's only gets 4 stars is because no-one goes out of their way to greet you or to say goodbye when you leave. This is normally a big turn off for me, but the food quality keeps me coming back.        Love Yanni's Gyros. Yummo!"}
{"text":"Ok place. Lady at the counter no so helpful. Ask he about the menu and she just read off the menu to me. Food ok. Equivalent to Daphines to me."}
{"text":"My girlfriend lives near this place and likes to get takeout once or twice a month. The food is pretty good for the price and the staff are usually pretty friendly. I like the traditional lamb gyro."}
{"text":"Quick review: best Greek / Mediterranean food that I have found in the Valley. Reminds me of the Greek restaurants I grew up on in NY. Large portions, fresh ingredients, great color and smell that you would like to see from an \"authentic\" Greek restaurant. Say hello to Yanni and get ready to feast!   In depth review: I typically do a large take-out order once a week from Yanni's. It never fails to \"wow\" me. Small family owned business in a strip mall on the busy corner of Maryland and Silverado Ranch Blvd (around the corner from Sushi Mon). There are about a dozen tables inside and two tables outside for people who want to \"dine in.\" Take out is prompt and they can have your freshly made order ready in under 15 minutes typically.   My recommendations are as follows: - The Lamb Gyro plate (plates come with large portions of meat on top of rice and a generous side salad, Pita bread and Tzatzikii sauce).  - The Chicken Gyro Plate - The Chicken Club Sandwich - Amazing Gyros (they are large) - Garlic Feta Fries (my favorite and quite possibly the best \"side item\" on their menu) - Large and fresh salads  I suggest you order extra Tzatziki sauce as it's homemade and delicious. The small container they give you is never enough. Only complaint would be that the small space gets smokey as the landlord has not properly vented the space yet. They claim it is being addressed. Front doors slide open and they typically vent out the room.   Also to the person who gave them a star below and said it was frozen \"Steak-Um\" meat - you are 100% wrong. Authentic Greek restaurants use a vertical rotisserie method of cooking Greek gyro meat. They thinly shave the flavored meat and it will resemble \"Steak-Um\" meat in appearance but I can assure you it will not taste like it. Yanni's cooks right in the open and you can see what they are doing. It's delicious!   This is a solid restaurant and I have no issue giving it a 5 Star Rating on Yelp.   Keep up the good work Yanni and family."}
{"text":"This quaint little spot def isn't as cheap as the reviews would lead you on to believe. $10.95 for a gyro isn't what I would consider cheap combo, but it was for the quality of food you receive! The lady friend and I enjoyed the food while watching Monday night football was more than cute and enjoyable...plus the owners throw in of an on the spot desert more than has me wanting to come back to this place! Oh yeah...def try the fries!"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints me! My boyfriend & I always come here for the garlic feta fries and they are absolutely amaaaaazing. The chicken plate and chicken wrap are also delicious. I definitely will be returning again, again, and again! :)"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! I usually get the Greek Salad with Chicken. I love that the chicken is a clean breast with lots of seasoning.  It's a good size as well. Omg it's soooo good! The dressing is amazing! Not sure what's in it but its out of this world! Their chicken kabob is amazing as well. Yummy rice. Must have the pita and hummus too!!"}
{"text":"I always get the same thing cause I hate change when something is that good, so I wouldn't be of much help point someone in the direction of various items to chose from. However, you can't go wrong with the chicken gyro and garlic feta fries."}
{"text":"This is my go to for gyros.  I love the paper thin meat great flavor profile.  The topping are perfect and the tazeki sauce is so good I always ask for extra. The feta fries are so tasty. If you give them a try you get cravings and go regularly. I wanna try other things on the menu but I always am satisfied with the usual.  The family is really nice too defiantly worth supporting. They all work so well together. .."}
{"text":"Amazing...  just do it!  The feta fries are great. The gyros are great. The service is quaint. No complaints!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Greek spots in Las Vegas.  Service is always friendly and the food is always delicious"}
{"text":"I haven't been to the actual restaurant however I have ordered takeout several times. The driver was on time and the food excellent"}
{"text":"While most things here are good, the Garlic Feta Fries are to die for!!!    We order them everytime.  The only issue I would say is that staff is hit or miss.  There is a gentleman that I believe is the manager and he is awesome!!!   BUT.... all the other staff I have met has been inconsistent with service and food creation.   As an example, each time the same kid has made my fries it was different, and I watched him cook fries, make part of the order, realize he was short and threw like 10 more fries in the cooker while my order sat there getting cold.   It looked like a \"Hot Mess\"  HA  . Either way, we love the fries so much, we come back."}
{"text":"I love yannis seriously some of the best falafel  I've ever had little Spicey,I like it! I also love the spanikopi. My only suggestion is maybe a little more feta on the salads for the price."}
{"text":"I have been here before and loved it. Haven't been here in a while and I won't be back. Asked if there were new owners because something was different but he said no. Looked it up and it is true, different owners. Try not to hide behind that be proud. Sad to see the previous owner sold out and left his good name behind."}
{"text":"Another one of my favorite lunch spots when I'm in the area. Service is always great and food is always yummy. The last few visits have been with a co-worker. She seems to like it too."}
{"text":"Meh, this place is mediocre at best, the gyros are NOT SLICED fresh which was disappointing  ,  its pre-sliced, pre-cooked then put through a conveyor to be heated up.. it's run you about $ 10-12 for a lunch combo  which includes a gyro, side and a drink. The staff unfriendly and not welcoming..  The food did present itself well and taste good. But I won't be back due to the last of customer service and not freshly sliced meats..."}
{"text":"Service was fast and food is amazing!! Would definitely recommend this restaurant to friends and family."}
{"text":"best place ever!! come here every friday. food is great & service is amazing!"}
{"text":"This is the best Greek food I've had in Vegas. I love that it's a little mom and pop shop, and I don't have to go to a fancy sit-down restaurant to get good, authentic Greek food. Their dolmades (grape leaves) are the best I've had, and their gyros are big, filling, fresh, and delicious. Their Greek fries are also yummy. It's a little on the pricey side, but for the quality and portions you can't get much better.  FYI their location has moved from Eastern to Maryland and Silverado Ranch, just a couple miles west of the old location right behind Chase bank."}
{"text":"Not bad, but I believe it's under new management or owners. But it is a little different than I remember in the past. Customer service was good, but the ice machine on the Coke machine has been broke for at least a month, gyro meet seems a bit thinner and not as flavorful or plentiful in the wraps. Just does not have that authentic taste to it like it too. The garlic fries were good but not fresh."}
{"text":"I came here because I was hungry and it's right next to Chase drive thru ATM. I had their Falafel pita sandwich. ($7.95) The food came out pretty quick. The guy that took my order was helpful with the menu. The Falafel was salty but delicious. Would've been perfect if it was less salty. Pita bread was not soft. It was crunchy a bit for some reason. Their price is reasonable and the portion size is big. A nice little place to eat lunch on a budget. Pet friendly patio seating. Closed on Sundays."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints! Enjoying a late lunch with the soon to be ex husband after a court date down town. Chicken shish kabobs, garlic feta fries and some hummus to complete the meal. A free side dish makes a sweet meal a sweet deal."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Greek place in the area and I've tried several since moving to Vegas. All of their food is made fresh and comes out piping hot. The chicken is juicy and tender just like it's supposed to be. The staff is friendly and the price is right. I get take out at least once a month."}
{"text":"This place was good but not as good as I thought they would be. Portions and service were great but the quality of the gyro I've had was mediocre. The gyros at the mall maybe able to put this place in some serious competition. I'll try this place again but for my first time experience here, my rating seems just."}
{"text":"when i get homesick for chicago, and i need some culture in Vegas, I come here. The gyros and authentic and they remind me of my childhood and greektown.  the greek fries are yummy too! the only thing that i can complain about is that when I went with my boyfriend, it was DEAD. it was a little uncomfortable, but whatever! the food was awesome."}
{"text":"Great tasting food. A little expensive but worth the money. Food usually takes about 20 minutes to make.   A solid staple for us since 2013"}
{"text":"Near my house and decided to check this place out. Just not impressed. Maybe I am spoiled. I am used to fresh shaved meat off a roasting spick. The gyros meat was shaped like the meat I buy from Sprouts. Looked pre-packaged and then run through a toaster oven. The salad was a bit too vinegary. The feta was nothing spectacular. I am not saying I will never go there again if I want to get my Gyros on, but it just wasn't as good as I am used to."}
{"text":"I ordered the Vegetarian combo & to be honest. I didn't taste that good to me. I ate the vegetarian platter at Pita House across the street a week before & it just didn't compare. It was basically the same course but didn't taste as good.   They weren't as friendly so if I were to choose between the 2 when I'm craving Mediterranean, I'd rather go to Pita House.   The baba ganoush seemed oily & the falafel was dry & too salty. Even their tahini sauce wasn't as good as theirs. Just my opinion."}
{"text":"The food was awesome the owner have a great and best customer service very recommend that place to anyone who like Mediterranean food enjoy"}
{"text":"My boyfriend LOVES this place.  However, I have been disappointed after trying it twice.  The first time I just thought it wasn't that great, I've had way better greek food pretty much everywhere else. This time they gave me lamb instead of chicken.  I didn't notice it until I got home, which is about 15 min away so I wasn't going to go back.  I didn't even eat it because I don't like lamb.  The fries were just okay.  I would've given one star but since my BF is such a huge fan they must be doing something right"}
{"text":"We had an amazing experience here. Asaad, the owner was great and provided excellent service with a smile. We had Gyros, Chicken (with great flavor) and Lamb. The Greek Salad and Hummus was so on point!!! We also had the Garlic Feta Fries, they were also bomb! I will definitely be returning, the ambiance was clean and the weather was perfect! Thank you Yanni's!!!"}
{"text":"I had a gyro here a couple of weeks ago, it was $8+. Was shocked for that price than you get 8 paper thin slices of pre-packages gyro meat heated up in a toaster oven and put on pita with toppings and sauce. No complaints about toppings, pita, or sauce but for $8 for just a gyro it should be the real deal."}
{"text":"First time here, found this place on yelp. I was ordering to go and I was 2nd in line. My order took over 25min and when I asked what took so long the guy said it was because the rice was bad. There were two other people that ordered after me and they both received their food quite promptly. Granted their orders may have not required rice as mine did but they didn't wait more than 5-7min. I don't think I'll be back"}
{"text":"A small shop located off of Maryland Parkway.  I have gone here twice and it has never been busy with customers but they are always packing to go orders.  I think Yanni's is the best Greek food in town.  It is real Greek food!  I ordered the Greek salad fileld with cucumbers, tomatoes, olives, onions and my favorite FETA cheese!   Portion size was great and so were the prices."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick lunch after work and surprisingly no lunch rush. The restaurant itself is a bit unorganized and cluttered. So many random chairs just scattered around and the tables needed to be wiped down a bit more. The guy taking my order wasn't very friendly and I was a bit scared to go and order LOL but that's besides the point.   I ended up getting the traditional gyro pita combo, which comes with a drink and your choice of a side dish (I got the garlic feta fries). Wait time wasn't long. The gyro was subpar in my opinion. There wasn't much meat and instead, was stuffed full with lettuce, red onion and tomatoes. It could have used more sauce too but that would cost you 50 cents. Those garlic feta fries though...yas! My favorite part of the meal. Perfectly crispy fries tossed in a mild and tangy hot sauce, garlic, and feta cheese. This is the must try here!"}
{"text":"Wow lots of haters! Wonder if Yanni had a bad day or something....I was pleasantly surprised with my lunch. I had the gyro & hummus for my side. I thought the lamb had good flavor, was cooked perfect and the tzatziki had good flavor as well, a little more dill than I'm used to but it was still good. The gyro was big, and my pita bread & hummus side was fresh & flavorful, and it came with a drink, for $10.95 you can't beat it!   My only issue was, I went to the counter to order some baklava to go, the lady behind the counter had her purse on top of the cutting board, alI could think of was her purse was just on the floor, nothing like a little E. Coli to go along with my lunch. If I didn't witness this, the rating would've been higher. I was a bit creeped out."}
{"text":"Solid Greek fast food.  THE TZATZIKI SAUCE IS AMAZING!!!  I got the chicken gyro combo with Feta French fries and a drink which set me back about 9 bucks. The gyro is packed with thinly sliced chicken, lettuce, tomatoes and lots of tzatziki. The entire gyro was not the best I have ever had but the tzatziki sauce sure was. Have I talked about the tzatziki sauce yet?   The Greek feta fries were deliciously crispy.   I was a little disappointed because we went before noon and they said the spanakopitas were not made yet. Sad!   The people are very friendly. Also there are cushy seats with pillows to sit on and enjoy your tzatziki drenched whatever!"}
{"text":"It was ok the gyros didn't have much meat in them more lettuce then anything and most gyro's I have had have none will  try to find a better Greek place"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Greek place we have ever been to!! We've tried so many places all over the Vegas area and absolutely nothing compares (and we tell the people at Yanni's this every time even if it makes us sound like traitors LOL). Their prices are reasonable, their customer service is excellent, and they even made some new upgrades to the place! We were SO excited about the fact that they are now open on Sundays because that's always the day Yanni's sounds best! And the fact that they deliver now too... Now we're going to eat there even  more! Especially when it's hot out and we don't want to drive.. We've been to Yanni's many many times over the last few years and we've never been disappointed, not once. We love this place. 5 stars and very much deserved. I'm surprised they don't have more locations around Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved my gyro and garlic feta fries. While I was here, a lady told the owner that she visit her family in New York and in Greece and told her she loved how authentic the gyros were. Me? I wouldn't know if they are authentic or not, I just know the gyro I had was wonderful. Moist meat, right amount of sauce too. Also something unique that I've never had before was the garlic feta fries, these were very good however I must warn you, do not have these fries on a first date or if you need to speak customers at work. Very, very nice people here, they seemed to be friendly to everyone. I didn't try their baklava but the table next to me raved about it so I'll try it next time because I know I'll be back next time I'm near here. Some reviews may say these place is pricey, but I just think those people are cheap, prices were in line with other gyro places. I got the gyro meal for $10.95 which included a side and drink. Totally reasonable. Try this place I think you'll like it."}
{"text":"Yanni is awesome...I like to call him my uncle cause I go there a lot and he hooks you up. The best greek food I've had so far. Can't compare. It's to the point where I wouldn't go anywhere else because nothing taste as good as how he makes it."}
{"text":"Had an old school gyro to go.  Quality was OK, the place was clean, staff polite. The portion was pathetic. With tax, it was $9.69 no drink, no fries. Very poor value. Lunch for two with sodas, sides, and tip would be $40. I ate the sandwich and was still hungry.  So not a $10 sandwich, here in Las Vegas, there are thousands of better values.  TERRIBLE value. I will never return. I felt like I was ripped off. For the same price at Roberto's, I can get a carne asada burrito con queso y crema that will feed me twice!"}
{"text":"I love Greek food so I wanted to give this place a go. The food came out hot and as expected. I wish the dishes came with some hummus but it is offered for an additional charge. We ordered the chicken plate and the beef plate and both meats were very very good; perfectly cooked! I will be back! Also if you check in you get a free side. Garlic feta fries were seriously amazing!"}
{"text":"We ordered the gyro pita with a Greek salad and a side of the Garlic Feta fries and it was all yummy!! We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"The food here is good, prices are reasonable, and it's conveniently located. The only reason I do not give 5 stars is because unless the owner is there the quality of the food goes down. Also, the size of the drink cups is laughable, give the customers bigger cups."}
{"text":"This place has always been a favorite of mine.  All you need to know is that their Gyros are the best I've ever had.  The lamb meat is so tender and and the z sauce is perfect.  The are $8 but they are big and tasty.  You can also get a nice combo with fries and a drink for just $2 more.  Give this place a shot.  It feels like a small ma and pop shop (but I don't know if it is corporate or not)."}
{"text":"The chicken shawarma was amazing!! Hummus was a little runny, but everything else was great!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place! I have their number saved in my phone and order pickup almost once a week.   The lamb gyro with their spicy garlic fries is so yummy!  Staff Is so nice and the food is always delicious :)"}
{"text":"My wife and I have had several great Greek lunches at this little shop.   The food is very fresh. we have enjoyed both the hummus and the baba ganoush. The pita bread is really good, they cook it perfectly.  We have had gyros and Greek Salads. Both were great. The gyro meat is really good and the fries are very tasty."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in awhile, so I finally ordered a take out order for my coworkers and I. This place used to be so good, not sure what happened! We got the veggie plate and some gyros. The gyros were ok but not for the price. The portion size for the veggie plate was so small it was like a kids meal lol, not worth the $10. This place is definitely pricey for what it's worth. Not sure if I'll be coming back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"I like the feel of this place, really great atmosphere and it's small but not too crowded.  For some reason, as I was sitting and waiting a scene from my head played out.  It felt as if I was being drawn into a reality where the people seemed family oriented and they were serving gyro's right near the beach.  All right, back to reality.....The guy who took my order seemed lovable....he was more than happy to take my order.    I ordered the Combo for $10.95, a little pricey for lunch but I gave it a try.  It came with a gyro of my choice: lamb, chicken or falafel (I chose chicken), regular fries, or greek fries (me being me, I took the greek fries), and a soda.    The gyro was very bomblicious, I could do without the onions and maybe take the sour cream down a notch....but other than that it was amazing.  I've never tasted gyro's before so I have nothing to compare it too.  The greek fries were interesting, a little spices did give it a kick but nothing to brag about.    This place will indeed have another return.  I hope to order something different, but the gyros = DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"EXCELLENT!!!!!  I grew up on this kind of food and this is as good as it gets.  I had the Falafel pita and it was perfect.  Just the right amount of Tahini sauce, the Falafel were not greasy and Pita was very good.  AND the service and the people were as nice as you could want.   Can't wait to go back and try something new"}
{"text":"I used to think this place had the best gyros, super packed with fillings and flavor, layered in such a way that every bite had an even perfect distrabution of everything.   However, the last time we went the meat was dry and there wasn't much, the garlicky sauce they used to have was not really present, the taziki sauce was barely there to so it was just dry and flavorless.  On top of that they were kinda dropping the ball with service, and competency.  We were just getting a gyro to pick up and they were charging us like we had two combos.  When my boyfriend told them it was not right, they then gave a price of one combo, he had to correct them again, point to the price of the ala carte item, and finally they charged us properly.  Maybe they have new owners not sure, I haven't been here in a while.  They used to have these awesome house fries loaded with spicy sauce, feta, and garlic, but who knows if it is the same anymore.  I really am bummed."}
{"text":"I think I may just start making all my Greek food at home.   The hummus was lacking flavor and the pita that came with it was stale.   The tzatziki was watery and there was no where near enough on the gyro. The gyro was also disappointing because the meat was just salty. This is a common problem. Chefs often confuse salty as being properly seasoned. Spice racks have more than one spot for a reason.   The baklava was inedible. It was so dry and stale but had a pool of ooze at the bottom.   Yanni's food is as terrible as the music produced by the man bearing the same name. It is an assault on your pallet."}
{"text":"Ordered a shawarma pita and baklava to go! Probably the biggest pita I've ever had in my life and they don't skimp on the shawarma. It was so flavorful and authentic tasting with Greek spices such as nutmeg. The baklava was delicious as well. Cant wait to try their other traditional Greek items. Staff was very friendly and had my order ready fast."}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago and we eat real gyro meat off the stick this place has the Frozen strips that they cook and that's not good I was very disappointed"}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum....need i say more?   Expected fast somewhat mediocre greek food....got the most delicious lunch!   Be sure to get the grilled chicken salad!"}
{"text":"I was exhausted and starving after being in a car all day. I was snacking on fast food during my mini road trip to vegas and was going to a family party at night.   I was in a huge dilemma, either wait for the party food and keep getting hungrier (and crankier) or get something really quick close to my family's house! I had my boyfriend drive me around the nearest plaza and I decided on eating at Yanni's. BEST DECISION EVER.  I ordered their chicken gyro to go and basically devoured it all during the 4 minute drive home to my cousin's house down the street. My boyfriend also had a couple of big bites. At first he said didn't want any, but when he saw my gyro he basically ate half of it because it smelled, looked and was delicious.  Such a great greek food establishment! Chicken was tender, juicy & flavorful! Pita was toasted just right! The tzatziki sauce was on point! It was huge and fills you up leaving you very content! Im disappointed i didn't try more on the menu...but next time i'm back in vegas, i know where i'll go!"}
{"text":"Overall Yanni's Gyro was ok. It has a good atmosphere for casual dinning and takeout.  Food: I was surprised there wasn't a meat spit for the gyro and all the meat was magically and uniformly sliced. (we suspect the ingredients was a pre-purchased product)  I also find it strange there is buffalo sauce in my garlic Greek fries since I never knew buffalo sauce was a part of Greek cuisine.  Pricing: For spending $22.00 we got a combo meal and a salad.  Portion sizes: Filling for 2.  Although the food is good, be aware it is Americanized Greek food.  If you're yearning for traditional Greek food, this may not scratch your itch."}
{"text":"Been here several times during the last few months and we have yet to be disappointed. The gyros are the best I've ever had.  The lamb is well seasoned and sliced thin. The tzatziki sauce is creamy and garlicky with just enough dill. The hummus was good, but not great.  The babaganoush however is one of the stars on their menu. Not being familiar with this particular dish, we were expecting something entirely different and we were pleasantly surprised with how good it was. The soup is lemon chicken and very refreshing. It is a perfect compliment to the rest of the menu. When we first saw the prices we had a little sticker shock but once the food was served and the quantity given we feel that the price is justified and a good value for the money."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. The shawarma and gyro are delicious and the buffalo feta fries are stupid good!"}
{"text":"Their hummus and basically everything on the menu is so on point !!!  I absolute love this place. If I could eat this everyday I would !"}
{"text":"My rating is for the gyro only.  Yanni's is located in a non-descript neighborhood strip mall.  On to the gyro:  The owner explained to me in great detail how they use authentic ingredients for the tzatziki sauce and how they ship in the pita bread.  Hey, do whatever you need to do, but keep those gyros coming.    In summary:  I've been on the hunt for great gyros for over twenty years.  This joint hits all of the marks."}
{"text":"The garlic feta fries make all three of my dicks hard. ROCK HARD. The buffalo sauce also turns on my bae."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Greek food. I wanted to try Yanni's because it's nearby and has good reviews. Food is delicious! Will definitely come back. Only thing was there was no ice in the soda dispenser when I went. Everyone seemed really tired after a long day, which is understandable. They're still very nice. I got the lamb pita and garlic feta fries. The combo is $10.95 (lamb or chicken pita/wrap with choice of side, and a drink). Definitely worth it because portions are hearty."}
{"text":"This place has pretty good tzatziki sauce but the chicken Gyro meat is FROZEN.  This is just unacceptable for a gyro shop. The owner is very nice and the service is good. Unfortunately the meat was not very good."}
{"text":"Yannis gyros is THE best gyro pita in the game...lamb gyro chicken gyro it's all dankies... and the garlic feta fries are enough to make a grown man cry...wifey always gets the beef filet kabobs and they are seriously da bomb yo. Even their simple Greek salad is one of the best"}
{"text":"It's close and I haven't gotten sick.   Food not bad but don't come here looking for authentic or ambience.   Another place across the street isn't that much better lol. ..  C,mon Greek fam. Don't be afraid to be excited about your food.    Thank you for good service as always"}
{"text":"I am a fan of their Greek chicken and rice! My friend ordered the fries and those were dressed well and had great flavor.  I really want to try their gyros next. It is a small family owned restaurant, but they provide friendly service and some nice Greek food.   Last weekend, I tried to go into the restaurant but they were closed because I think they were doing some remodeling to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Soon as I stepped in I get a hello. ( you know they are on their game )  First time here and they took their time with me helped me out finding a meal that I would like.  I got the classic gyro and fries.  The gyro was mouth watering good. They have some of the freshest toppings I have had. The fries..... Omg the feta cheese on them just add a taste that makes you want to jump for joy.   I will always be back."}
{"text":"I've tried Yanni's Gyros when it was located on Silverado Ranch and Eastern. They didn't serve fries with it then. It was pretty big and yummy. I liked how they had the option of getting it in a wrap (wrapped in tortilla rather than pita bread) or regular. I opted for the wrap so it's easier to eat. haha It was a pretty big size came out looking like a giant burrito. haha Anyway, both are really filling. I was sad they didn't have fries though. They also did not have a soda fountain. Had to pay an extra 2 dollars per drink for soda bottles. It's a cute ma and pa place. They got the mom, dad and the son working there. It's a little expensive but aren't all gyros expensive.  So, I noticed that they moved to Maryland and Silverado Ranch. I noticed that now they have fries! I really want to go back and have some gyros with garlic fries. Hubby and I went inside and checked out the menu. It was 8 dollars and some change for the gyro and 3 or 4 dollars for the fries. We decided we can spend 8 bucks on an entree elsewhere. We left!   One day I'll have to order from there on my own. Hubby doesn't enjoy gyros much."}
{"text":"OK so I LOVE Greek food. This is my third time here this week! The food is amazing, service is great, always friendly. I always get the chicken gyro plate and it's wonderfully seasoned, the salad is always fresh and the portion sizes are great! This place is amazing!!!! Definitely worth stopping buy."}
{"text":"I have been driving passed this place for almost a year now and finally stopped in to try it out. Usually I read some reviews before stopping somewhere but this place was calling my name. I got the gyro with the feta fries... And omg! I'm in love. The fries are to die for, just perfect. The meat on the gyro is thinly sliced and could be one of the best I've ever had. I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Yum!!!!!! Totally fresh and so good!!!! One of my must haves now!!! Authentic as it's gonna get! Incredibly sweet staff and so friendly."}
{"text":"First note: Yanni's moved about one year ago to the S. Maryland Pkwy address.   Dinner: My wife had the lamb gyro with Greek garlic fries. She was very pleased with the flavor and freshness. As she ate only 1/2 of the gyro, I get the rest tomorrow. I had the special with Greek salad. The salad was very good, just the right amount of a great dressing, fresh crisp lettuce, tomatoes and cucumbers, etc. The chicken shish kabob was served over a very pleasant bed of buttered fried rice. The chicken was seasoned nicely and was very tender. Will we return? Yes. It's a cute little place and food is priced reasonably."}
{"text":"Great food from a family owned restaurant. The staff are all very friendly and the portions are generous for the great price.  The garlic feta fries are where its at!"}
{"text":"Yanni's Gyros, my latest addiction. Indulge in Mediterranean, food and enjoy your food with a very laid back ambiance.  A friend of mine recommended this  place, and im glad he did. I would have never guessed this place was delicious, nor did they exists!   I ordered the lamb skewers which were to die for! It came with rice pealoff  and feta salad and I also ordered babaganoush ( eggplant).  The lamb skewers was grilled to perfection tender and juicey, the Feta salad was so good and the leaves were all fresh, could not find anyhting wrong with the meal.  The babaganoush was my first time trying it. It's simliar to the hummus but made with eggplant very delicious as well.  The service was great, really friendly and answered all the questions you had.  I will be coming back to this place, love it!"}
{"text":"I've been told that Vegas isn't really known for it's Greek food. Milos in the Cosmo is good, but I guess the person who told me this was referring to Gyros and the low-end Greek foods.   Yanni's was good! My brother, his wife and I were on our way home from the grocery store and Target (a very wild Vegas evening, right?) and we called in an order. Picked it up on the way home.   What stood out to me was the Tzatziki sauce. They make sure you go home with a lot of it, too. Slathered that stuff all over my Gyro and french fries. Yum! The Gyro was HUGE, too, and there was no way I could eat it all. Two people could easily split one with a side order of feta fries.  Good enough for me, but hey, I'm no expert on Greek eats!"}
{"text":"What can I say, I love the food. The place is clean and the people are friendly. The price is affordable and the service is quick."}
{"text":"Ok here's the thing... I looked stunned when I saw the prices. It's just lunch, a quick bite before i'm once again shackled to my desk and almost $9 for a Gyro seems a tad much. But I drove there to try it and a few extra bucks won't derail the plan.   I got a traditional Gyro and some greek fries for a co-worker. First, the Gyro is amazing. The pita is FRESH, the tomato...the sauce...all fresh and delicious. The fries...holy (insert greek god name here) these things are crisp, flavorful and just yum. feta cheese...some sauce with a little heat. REALLY GOOD!  So, yes it's a little pricey but you get a good portion and it's delicious. I can understand that starting a little gyro place can't be cheap so the prices reflect that and since the ingredients are so good it may be somewhat appropriate.   If you are hungry...go. Easily the best greek food I've had in vegas and for dinner it's a no-brainer"}
{"text":"Still my favorite local place to stop for greek/mediterranean. Kabobs are excellent.  Garlic feta fries are a gift from God.  Only downside is the pita sometimes. Sometimes tastes prepackaged or stale. That's where pita house has them beat because they make it fresh.  Everything else is great here. :)"}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Yanni's food ever since he owned The Greek Village Cafe over on Eastern. I was SO sad when that place shut down, but thrilled that he opend up Yanni's Gyros.  I used to dance here, my friends hosted a Tribal Fusion Belly Dance night, and that tiny place was always packed, but the service was always stellar, even when the restaurant was filled to capacity.  The quality of the food is second to none.  I have a few favorites, but the spanikopita and the greek gyro salad are my go tos.  I don't get to come out here very often anymore, as its a little far from where I live, but its in the same shopping center as the tattoo parlor my friends and I frequent, so its tattoo day food. :D    Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Really delicious! lamb gyros are amazing there, super fresh and flavorful. I'm pretty sure this is a mom and pop place because I tried to buy some baklava the other day (which is delicious and amazing as well), and the woman who was there-- I believe one of the owners, said she hadn't had the time to make anymore that day *noooooooooooooo*"}
{"text":"Craving some Greek food, and saw Yanni's in the Smiths shopping center.  Ordered the traditional gyro and garlic feta fries.  The fries were delicious, with salty feta, garlic and hot sauce drizzled on top.  I loved them.  The gyro was a bit dry.  Small portion of meat and tatziki sauce.  The pita was dry and thin as well.  Not the best gyro I've had.  But not he worst either."}
{"text":"Gyro Pita and Garlic Feta Fires were excellent!  Gyro salad had as much meat as the Gyro Pita as well."}
{"text":"What Yanni has going for it is the warm and toasted pitas. They are easy to lose count on. If my meal only consisted of that component, I would probably have been extremely happy. The Babaganoush was not bad either. My friend and I had each ordered a Gyros Combo. I got my lamb sandwich with the eggplant dip and he got his with regular fries. Both side dishes were good. The sandwiches were where we had most of our issues. The pita was yet again the best part of the dish. I also loved how they stuffed the massive gyro with fresh lettuce, tomatoes, and onions. The tzaziki sauce was bland and had no real distinguishing character. And then there was the meat. This uniformly thin sliced cut had no texture or flavor. Instead of getting a nice crisp char like the cone style meat, it did not enhance the pita at all."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I love gyros.    It's been a torrid love affair ever since I was a young boy and I'd look forward to going to the fair more for the gyro my dad would always buy me moreso than riding the Super Sizzler afterwards.   Pretty sure if I tried that 1-2 combo in my ripe old age of 32 that I'd need to be hospitalized immediately afterward.  I find that important to note because I literally have never had a bad gyro, much like I've never had a bad chicken finger.  I could probably locate the worst rated Mediterranean restaurant in Las Vegas and still enjoy a gyro there.  ALL THAT BEING SAID, I absolutely covet the lamb version from Yanni's.  Stuffed full of fresh gyro meat and then covered with bright, fresh tomatoes lettuce and onions and then topped off with their delicious tzaziki.    Get an order of their fries smothered with feta and hot sauce.  To be honest the fries themselves arent spectacular, but anything covered with feta and hot sauce becomes a masterpiece to me.  Service has always been pleasant, and the price is decent for the quality you get.  EXTRA BONUS COMMENTARY:  It's not a JAI-RO.  It's a YEE-RO.   If I hear you say JAI-RO I will smack you.   And then you will probably kick my ass.  But hopefully my point will have gotten across anyhow."}
{"text":"Authentic Greek food. Greek salads are gyros are the best. Prices are a little steep for what they offer."}
{"text":"The french fries are amazing and I'm not a typical french fry fan.  The traditional gyro has great flavor, is fresh, hot and pretty well proportioned.    My only complaint/suggestion: get a side of fries (the portion that comes with the meal/combo is not nearly enough!).  $10 is a bit much for a meal, in my mind, but it wouldn't stop me from going back again and again.  O...and we tried the chicken gyro but we'll definitely stick with the lamb.  :)"}
{"text":"Lamb Gyro w/ Garlic Fries.  You can't go wrong with this combo. Make sure you check in w/Yelp to get a free side.  Everything here is delicious. Authentic taste."}
{"text":"It was OK.  the Hummus was bland & the food took like 20 mins to come out.  didn't think it was that affordable either."}
{"text":"This place is a mixed bag, and I don't know if it gets a 3-star review on account of the lack of decent places for gyros south of the 215.  The pros: #1) pita is flaky and moist, almost like a gordita flatbread. #2) vegetables used are clearly fresh. #3) the tzatziki sauce is stronger on the dill than the cucumber, which adds a different flavor profile than you normally find in gyros - less refreshing but more exotic. #4) The staff is very friendly.  The cons: #1) meat is sliced too thinly and not piled high enough. #2) entirely too much lettuce filler - even the tomato and onion seem drowned out. By lettuce! At least it's romaine and not iceberg. #3) diced, instead of sliced, onions & tomatoes make for a messier sandwich and less flavor impact. #4) the price (nearly $10 with tax!)  On the whole: a tasty, but unfulfilling sandwich made from high-quality ingredients. Overpriced, but super-friendly staff. Like I said, a mixed bag."}
{"text":"A microwave? Really? And who uses styrofoam anymore? NO comparison to the Greek Bistro in Henderson. The meat was precooked and dry, and the owner was weird."}
{"text":"Food was very flavorful. Temperature was nice and hot. I love the fact they remembered the eating utensils. The price was decent. I felt the above mentioned attributes were excellent. Especially, considering the fact the food was delivery and to a gym no less, I felt that was awesome. The demeanor of the delivery man was bright and enthusiastic. My only criticism I guess could be the delivery fee 5.99. But over all no that big of a deal. I just feel this amount of a delivery fee could be a hinderance for some. But I loved the fact it was healthy food delivered. I would definitely order from Yanni's again when I visit Las Vegas or Henderson Nevada. I'm from California and can't think of anything of delivery Greek, that beats Yanni's. Highly recommend this restaurant to others."}
{"text":"I've not had Greek/Mediterranean food in awhile.  Was craving a gyro and baba ghanoush.  I ordered the combo platter with each item.  I was disappointed to see they use the frozen, thin, pre sliced strips of packaged gyro meat.  The menu said the meat is lamb.  When you say it's one thing - it shouldn't contain a blend.  This gyro meat is certainly a blended product.  Typically bad.     While I sat and looked at the gyro I had to make the best of it.  The pita was fresh and warm.  Other than the gyro meat the rest of the internal garnish in the product was fresh, crisp, and the tzatziki sauce was refreshing.  The baba ghanoush was ok.  It lacked color and texture.  I would hope a fresh made product (crossing my fingers on that one) would be a bit more robust and chunky.  This could be accomplished by fire roasting the eggplant. They tried their best to dress up the dish with a nice floral arrangement of sliced  cucumber.  I sadly had to add a touch of hot sauce to give it a little flavor.     For around $12 you get a gyro, side, and a drink.  Not too bad.  It would be nice to see them utilize a better gyro meat product.    I'll try it again.....I will stay away from the gyro meat and try one of their other dishes"}
{"text":"My hubby & I love this place!! It's very fresh and cooked to order. You may have to wait a little longer than other spots but totally worth it. I like that it's made to order and not been just sitting around. I especially like the chicken kabob combo and the Greek fries. They also deliver and are now open on Sundays! Try this place, you'll love it!!"}
{"text":"not alot of gyros options in town but this is a good one...i get the combo with greek fries...i do wish they had fountain soda instead of cans...i hope they do enough business to stay open."}
{"text":"Salad was amazing. The gyro had an excellent combination and balance. I could eat here every day"}
{"text":"I ate at this restaurant for the first time last week thinking I was stopping in for Greek \"fast food\" and I was pleasantly surprised to find that it tasted nothing like fast food. It was the real thing! Everything was so fresh and homemade. I had the best Greek salad I have ever eaten.  The lamb was so tender and tasty. My husband ordered the baklava, which I have never liked, but I tasted his and ate the whole thing! He had to order another.  I plan on ordering a tray of it for Christmas Eve."}
{"text":"I love this place. Everything is made fresh and you can tell the difference by how it taste. The food and service is great. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great gyro place."}
{"text":"What a surprising find!  We needed something great, inexpensive and fast while in the neighborhood. This totally fit the bill. The feta garlic fries were a eclectic treat. Yum!"}
{"text":"Super yummy Gyros! Awesome vegetarian options too! I really loved their falafel, it wasn't dry which is what I'm always afraid of. I'm glad I live right next door, I'll be visiting often!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Greek spot in Vegas. The restaurant is operated by one family. I get the same warm welcome everytime. The garlic fries are so delicious. I get the beef and lamb with rice. The portions are perfect for one person. Great price, Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Best Greek food I've had in a while, it's so flavorful and worth the money you pay. Try the Garlic Feta Fries, they are so amazing. Also the Chicken Gyro is so delicious, and you can get a giant combo for only 11.84$ It's worth it, and on the plus side there are cute guys that come in."}
{"text":"The restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it. The staff is extremely nice and will happily tell you all about the food. Everything is fresh and has a homemade but better taste to it. I LOVE greek food and am very picky about it tasting authentic. This is the only place to replace my favorite greek place that closed down a few years ago. Love the food and staff. I will definitely be a regular customer!"}
{"text":"Right across the street from my house, love it, family owned and fresh tasting. Nice warm atmosphere. The garlic Feta Fries rule..   Great portions for the price..  A must for Gyro lovers and foodies!  So happy i can walk to it, when the weather gets cooler"}
{"text":"My buddy wanted to try Yanni's today so I met him for lunch there.  The place is right next to my favorite sushi joint...Sushi Mon..so it was hard not to eat there being so close.  Well the place was very clean and seemed like a very nice Greek family owns the place.  You can see behind the register the food prep area and this family kept everything spotless and organized.  I ordered the Gyro and was happy to find out they give you a few choices for your side dish instead of French fries.  I ordered the Baba Ganoush.  The Gyro with side came to $12.  They surprised me by bringing me out a plate of Baba Ganoush ahead of my Gyro being delivered.  This dish was displayed well on a nice plate with some olive oil and an olive in the middle of it.  They gave me some pita bread along with it.  I thought it could have been a little thicker but was very happy with the flavor.  I glanced around and the other two people were eating salads and they looked very good.  When my Gyro came it looked good and the onions and tomatoes seemed very fresh.  The amount of Gyro meat was also ok but I would have liked more meat.  What really disappointed me was that the place served the frozen strips of Gyro meat which in my opinion just isn't acceptable.  They need to have the meet turning on the skewer getting cooked nice and hot and then shaved off and stuffed full.  I also felt like the the Gyro had too much lettuce in it.  So overall I thought the place was nice, service excellent, side dish excellent but was disappointed in my main meal.  I would not go there for a Gyro again and that's the main thing they serve hence the name Yanni's Gyros.  But I would go back and try a greek salad.  Overall still ok..but my problem is I know several places in town to get better gyros."}
{"text":"Awesome little Greek spot for some tasty gyros, wraps, and salads!  And don't forget the garlic feta fries!! So good! But spicy, so consumer beware! Prices are very reasonable and the food is very filling. I took a baclava home for later and it was also very good. We will definitely be back here sooner instead of later."}
