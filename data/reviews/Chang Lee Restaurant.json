{"text":"The decor is like out of a 70's flash back, retro nothing wrong with that. I had the house chicken combo. It was good, noodles are tasty but the fried rice left a lot to be desired.Friendly service and decent price. This is my 2nd time here.  I enjoy the employees they are very nice and friendly always there to lend a suggestion.  They have a great selection of menu items and great specials."}
{"text":"Every time we come here, we receive consistent customer service, quality, attractive food and a lot of it for the price.  This is our go to spot, especially after a hard day and we need someplace quiet to unwind. Thank you to the family of staff who have made this place uniquely superior to most sit down chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"I had dinner from Chang Lee last night and one of the items I ordered was Sweet and Sour Pork. I was very good with a thick, fruity sauce. Very good sauce! I am now giving 4 Stars but still wish the Sweet and Sour dipping sauce for the egg rolls(good egg rolls) was perfected. I also had the fried won tons and they are normally a throw away but these had flavor a an excellent fry."}
{"text":"The spoon and fork were dirty and looked as though they were recently used. The Kung Pao chicken was rubbery and had no vegetables. The fortune cookie was stale?!?"}
{"text":"Read the yelp reviews and thought this would be a good place to try. I had lemon chicken and my husband had chicken chow mien with crunchy noodles. The chow mien was very salty and lacked flavor. Lemon chicken was not bad but not good either. It was tough to chew. We will not be back. Should have read more of the reviews going back further. Service was quick but that's about all I can say."}
{"text":"Outstanding restaurant in such a unassuming location. wonderful host, and sweetheart server, family operated I think. Yui Shan Scallops, Fu Young, and Pot Stickers  for the price. 3 Stars, but it takes a lot to get that out of me."}
{"text":"Tonight, while driving home, I experienced a hankering for Chinese food. I knew of a couple of spots, but they were out of my way. I decided to grab some takeout from this buffet on Grand that I knew of when I drove past this place. I saw a sign out of the corner of my eye, thought it had a Chinese sounding name, so I flipped around and decided to give it a try.  Upon entering the restaurant, I noticed it was very quiet for a Friday night. I thought it might be in the process of closing, but they weren't. After perusing the menu, I ordered the lemon chicken, same as Taric. After placing my order to go, I chatted up the owner about how long the restaurant had been there, how business was, etc. She was incredibly warm and friendly, and after hearing about how the economy had recently took a toll on their profits, I suggested that if the food was to my liking, I would stop in for return business.  In short, I'm grateful that I didn't read Taric's review beforehand, otherwise I may have been disinclined to visit. The lemon chicken that I had was fantastic. It wasn't at all overcooked, had a great flavor, and was served on a bed of delicious fried rice. Since my order was takeout, the lemon sauce was on the side. Expecting it to be super sweet and syrupy (as Taric suggested it was), I poured just a light drizzle on my chicken, and I found it to be just the right flavor, so I added more.  As for the accoutrements, not only did my meal come with a wonton and a hefty eggroll, it also came with a fried shrimp. The combination meal that I ordered was considered the smaller portion, and it was filling. My out the door total was less than nine bucks, so I have no idea how anyone could call this food overpriced.  All in all, I had an excellent meal (that totally hit the spot after 90 minutes of hot yoga) for a reasonable price at a local business that I will be more than happy to continue to give my business to. This is officially my spot close to home."}
{"text":"Gross! I got a combo platter of chicken curry. On the menu it had a red pepper next to it, meaning to signify that it was spicy, but the curry was extremely bland, and it looked like greasy water. I assume that it is because they have such a thin curry that the dish was served in a cup-shaped fried egg roll wrapper. Not only was the sauce a disappointment, but the chicken was extremely fatty.   The fact that it was a combo platter meant that I also received side dishes... First of all, their fried rice has no egg or veggies in it, so it's just soy sauce-soaked salty rice. The egg roll was okay, although it was the heaviest egg roll I've ever encountered, since it was primarily fried wrapper around meager contents. There was also a side of horribly MSG-laden lo-mein. Finally there were two buffalo wings which I never got to because by that point I was not really wanting to eat any more of their food offerings.  First bad meal out I've had in a long time (food-wise, anyway... at least the staff was pleasant). Maybe they have other foods that they are better at making? I don't know, and won't be back to find out!"}
{"text":"Writing this review while still sitting in the restaurant.  Hunan beef was very good, spicy enough to cause some sniffles but still enjoyable to eat.  And the crab rangoon (called crab angels here) were great and I eat those everywhere I can get them.  Prices are reasonable and service was quick but it was not that busy when I got here either."}
{"text":"I asked a business near Chang Lee's if they would recommend their food, and everyone said yes. I was greeted immediately upon entering Chang Lee's by two less than enthusiastic waitresses. I ordered take out (sweet & sour pork, fried rice, and a coke).  While waiting in the lobby, I noticed several displeasing things. There was a half full coffee carafe in a soda/water mini fridge, their fish tank had scum all over the inside with little foliage or rock (these help de-stress fish), and their TV was set to Unsolved Mysteries--not exactly an appetizing show.  I received my food and headed back to work. The soda tasted...dirty. I don't know how it is possible, but my Coca Cola in a Styrofoam cup tasted as if there were dust or dirt in it. I couldn't even choke it down.  The pork wasn't bad, good flavor, but very fatty. The rice was nothing special, just a filler by far. Hardly any veggies or egg included in it.   I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"We have been eating at Chang Lee since the 80s. The food is good, decor is amusing, a little dated, but not offensive. I appreciate the independently owned restaurant these days, where everything is not cookie cutter the same as another. It is a quality place to go."}
{"text":"Remembering a past positive experience here, a friend suggested we eat dinner last night.  We were both disappointed in the food, although the atmosphere and service were excellent.   I had the cashew nut shrimp which was presented in a clear sauce with either frozen or canned cubed carrots, peas, shrimp and sliced water chestnuts.  The shrimp were nice and plump, but I was grossed out by the off taste of the water chestnuts - like they had been sitting in the fridge in an opened can for a few days. Ugh.  Between the pale cubed carrots and the water chestnuts I kinda lost my appetite.   My friend ordered the sweet and sour pork.  She said the meat was tough - and there was only one soggy pineapple chunk.  She also said the egg roll wasn't as good as before.   We both said we would not return."}
{"text":"Fehgedaboudit.  Ordered large shrimp and they served me what looked & tasted like bread or batter in the shape of large shrimp."}
{"text":"I REALLY wanted to be able to give this restaurant a good review as that would mean I'd found a great Chinese restaurant- finally- in the Sun City area, and esp. because it's so close to my new home here.  I was leery because of reviews I'd read here and on nextdoor.com, but was willing to give it my own try.  I ordered shrimp chowmein (called lo mein every other place I've been) because I figured \"how bad can that be?\"; then for precisely the same reason/in order to get an accurate assessment of their food, I also ordered cashew shrimp (I was craving shrimp).  The cashier/hostess was Very friendly and sweet, service for my walk-in/to-go order was much quicker than she said it'd be, and the interior decor (from what I saw of it) was quite nice.  Here comes the all-important BUT: the chow mein/lo mein was flavorless even after I added my own soy sauce at home.  Shrimp and onions were just dumped on top of the noodles in the container, not mixed in.  And the cashew shrimp turned out to be cashew chicken when I got it home, necessitating several calls to straighten out a refund for the difference. (Would have preferred a refund for that entree since I didn't get what I wanted, but at least it had a little flavor-though the cashews will no longer be crunchy at all tomorrow.) I doubt very much I'll be back, unless I decide to try the items that HAVE been recommended, given how desperate I am to find a new chinese place nearer my new home, than my new stand-by Big Heng."}
{"text":"Those who read my reviews know that I am a sucker for a good kitschy dive. There is no better, no kitschier dive than Chang Lee. It's quintessential, over the top decor always makes me smile and for those who turn their nose up to such things, you don't know what you're missing. The food at Chang Lee is delish. It is authentic, well seasoned, and served at all the right temps. Love that you can order the special and it comes with egg roll and chicken wings. The staff is friendly, polite, and attentive. Love that it's family owned and operated. I have come here many times over the years and I look forward to going back soon."}
{"text":"Well, I almost hate to write this review update, but feel I must in hopes that the owners will read it and make an effort to resolve some of the issues and bring their restaurant back to what I consider to be a good eating experience.   It all starts with the food.  I don't know if they have changed cooks or if they are not storing fresh foods properly or what, but something has changed, and not for the good.    We generally order the same dishes when we eat at Chang Lee's and so it is extremely easy to see, and smell, the difference in the food we are served.  Veggies are not fresh like they have been in the past.  This is not a good sign as fresh vegetables are key to an excellent tasting Oriental meal.    The restaurant is also not as clean as it has been in the past.  It's almost like the family, complete with young children, have taken over the waiting area at the entrance to the restaurant.  Reminds me of when I was raising children and they would all walk in the front door and begin dropping their school bags, etc. on the dining room table and chairs.  The restaurants waiting area in the front now resembles a cluttered living room -- not very welcoming for restaurant customers!  I will say, in the defense of the owners, that the construction that has been going on in the parking area adjacent to the restaurant, could have easily brought these negative changes on.  For months and months it was very difficult to get into the parking lot, much less find a place to park.    Since this restaurant is so close to home (two blocks away), I am hoping that the owners can realize that they need to \"clean-up and go back to truly fresh.\"   If they don't, I see how they will remain in business."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was a kid and it's delicious every time. My favorite entree is the garlic chicken. All appetizers are delicious especially the potstickers that are steamed then pan fried for a crunch. The staff is always courteous and prompt with food and drinks."}
{"text":"Omg! This is like the best Chinese food. I love it so much! I bring in some friends and family members with me and always get the best food! I used to order from here when I worked in Sun City back in the late 90's early 2000's it's the same goodness. I wish they would expand and put a restaurant in Glendale, till they do I'll continue going back lol"}
{"text":"Chang Lee's is a small family owned restaurant with old style décor, food, and a full bar.   I am surprised at some of the food reviews I have read .   I find their food to be consistent and not greasy - although I have not tried their curry.  Their fried rice is bland and could be better with some egg.  It is true that the food marked hot with the chili is only slightly hotter than mild. But if you want it really hot, just ask.    I like their egg rolls, hefty and not greasy. The broth for the wonton soup is the clearest I have seen. One of my favorites is moo shu pork. The filling is moist and flavorful with pork, Chinese black mushrooms, cabbage, and more served in Chinese pancakes with hoisin sauce. Another dish I order is sizzling rice shrimp. Decent sized shrimp with a few veggies in a mild sauce, when poured on the rice sizzles. My better half enjoys the lemon chicken which you can order baked or fried.    As far as service goes, the whole family is very friendly and will answer any questions you have.  They bring the food promptly, steaming hot.  Once we had to flag down our server for the bill.  If you want a relaxing meal in a quiet atmosphere with decent food, Chang Lee's is a good place to go."}
{"text":"We have been going to Chang Lee for about 10 years and had the pleasure of dining there today for lunch. We were introduced to it by friends in that area, and although we live in N. Phoenix, we look forward to heading over that way to have what we consider to be the BEST Chinese food anywhere. We have, in the past, just driven over just to eat there. My favorite is the Lemon Chicken, and my husband's is the Westlake Duck. The dumplings and the spring rolls are outstanding, too. If you are in the area of 99th Ave and Thunderbird (Sun City, at the end of a strip center), you're in for a T-R-E-A-T. It isn't fancy, but who needs fancy now-a-days?  Their food is just scrumptious! Bill T. Phoenix"}
{"text":"The service was okay with the waiter but the paying for the bill was horrible, we waited for 10 minutes at the stand and no one came. They do not have a kids menu which was sad but they did cater more towards the elderly with discounts as well. I would not go back because it was nothing special but the retro decorations made it an interesting stop!"}
{"text":"I ordered take out as I was in a hurry... I expressed concern over gluten/flour in the sauce. The hostess taking the order was very helpful and  after confirmation with another employee ( who recommended the special I ordered, advising me not to eat the wonton and eggroll) I placed my order.  My order was the lunch menu special recommend $6.95  shrimp with lobster sauce, and fried rice. (Normally it comes with an eggroll and wonton, but  not being able to eat those I passed and they did not charge me the upgrade from steamed to fried rice) it totaled almost $14 bucks! Not thrilled with that total I questioned it and the change was made from the dinner to   the lunch menu special. The food was pretty bland,  but as a salt lover, I was NOT left lacking... there were no veggies to mention in the fried rice... I would have truly given 2 stars but boosted it since fhey were so helpful with the gluten free issue, I KNOW not to eat an eggroll, but they took the time and care to make sure! :-)"}
{"text":"First time here, such a lovely experience for us. Very kind and helpful staff. The coconut curry chicken was awesome.  Pu pu platter for 1 was yummy too. We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Ever feel like people are dummies for NOT consulting Yelp? I often get into tiffs with my friends about which restaurants NOT to go to. I saw the sparse, lackluster views (especially from Iain B!) and said \"I think this is a bad idea. Are you SURE?\"...damn it, they just had to be.  This food is just as boring as the neighborhood. It looked well-kept enough, but was uncomfortably quiet. The menu was expansive, but I remained healthily skeptical about what and what not to order. While we waited, we were greeted with water and hot tea...  \"Sun Devil\" chicken/pork/beef sounded tasty, but I knew to call bullshit when it said \"extremely spicy\". So I settled for my staple at new Chinese restaurants: Lemon chicken. Why such an overdone dish? Because it tells me if they know how to make a chicken breast, the easiest meat to prepare, and they know how to make a sauce. They failed on both counts.  Sure, the chicken was cooked properly, but there was no detectable flavor in the meat itself OR the batter. It was sitting in a pool of a lemon syrup that didn't suit it at all. No hint of fresh lemons anywhere; it tasted like one half of a lemon meringue pie. It was WAY too sweet. My friend's Sun Devil pork came out, and I declined to try it. It was essentially chopped pork with plentiful diced jalapenos. What a snooze.   Chang Lee is full of mediocre, uninspiring food that lacks quality, is overpriced, and no sides other than a smidgen of white rice (No wontons? Egg rolls, even!?). I really don't have a reason to return."}
{"text":"Nothing near authentic Chinese food. Wife had Chicken Egg Foo Yan, very little chicken, egg foo Yan was pre-made pattie. Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"I was very apprehensive about going here because of Yelp reviews. But I was craving Singapore noodles. So I got an order to go. Mai fun noodles are the skinny rice noodles that absorb whatever sauce it's got mixed in, and Singapore noodles has a mild yellow curry mixed in. The dish has pork, chicken and nice sized shrimp with assorted vegetables stir fried in. I loved this dish. A medium hot curry, which was perfect for me. It definitely had the wow factor. I can't wait to try other dishes."}
{"text":"My wife introduced me to this place about 12 years ago and it's one of our favorites. We love the eggs rolls ,lemon chicken,shrimp fried rice,beef fried rice and Mushu chicken. It is very rare for us to find a menu item we haven't enjoyed. We get delivery but still enjoy dining in when we can. We have gone here so long we are regulars."}
{"text":"This restaurant = an icon to sun city. What a wonderful  & nice place to eat. Friendly staff. Family orientated. This restaurant had been here since the late 70s -mid 80s. My parents & I used to eat here often  --bringing back wonderful splendid memories of enjoying family friends and good Oriental food. ---- Because it is located in a retirement community where many snowbirds have retired, it is almost a seasonal spot !!! Not many people were in the restaurant when we ate there. ... That was a plus as we felt we were honored to be waited on so well... we enjoyed the combo plates and fish and seafood. It was excellent and I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Horrible food! Their fried rice looks and tastes like white rice. When I called and asked them about it, they said they put less soy sauce in during the summer months because of the smell. I did not want to hear any further information on that one. If you want bland food with no taste, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"I decided to try this restaurant out with my father in law and 2 kids. Upon entering, I was less than pleased by the decor. It just looked outdated. For the price they charge for the food, you would think some of that could be put into making the place look appealing. I ordered the house special chicken combination plate. The way they serve the main dish in a little fried shell of sorts was interesting at first... However, after I realized that the only crispy chicken (which is how this was described to me when I was asking about the dish) was right on top.. The rest of it was drowning in the sauce at the bottom of the shell and completely soggy. My daughter ordered the pork chow mein.. The carrots were brown and old looking, the water chestnuts were so rancid I had to spit it out.. (when I removed all of the water chestnuts from the dish and placed them to the side, I explained to the waitress that they had definitely gone bad, her response was, \"I will let the cooks know\")... Not even bothering to replace my daughters food. The pork was bland and in little fatty strips. The chicken wings that they give you with the meal were probably decent, as they looked good, but after the water chestnut incident, I didn't want to chance eating anything else.  My father in law got the sweet and sour pork... He didn't really tell me whether he liked it or not, but only ate a few bites. My other daughter is 2, so she got some noodles and rice from my plate. The booth was very small and narrow... Extremely uncomfortable to eat with the table top pressing into my chest. The only thing I really enjoyed was that the diet coke was amazing. They must have just cleaned the dispenser or something.  Bill total was $43. Not even a discount for ruining my appetite with rotten food.  The waitress was nice, she still got a 20% tip... But I will not return."}
{"text":"Loved this friendly and traditional restaurant!  Best I have had in years!  Lots of food and great service too! I will definitely be a regular  here!"}
{"text":"Chang Lee deserves some love. I've been coming here with my grandparents since I was a kid. The prices are right, always get a seat, service is great and the quality is consistent. Their style is a bit different than the other area Chinese places. I recommend the egg drop soup, house chicken and spicy shrimp. The location is a bit unlucky as the restaurant has had to deal with construction projects in one shape or another for the past couple years.  Give them a shot! I love it."}
{"text":"Great find! Great food! Really good service. Had the egg drop soup and it was yummy and home made. I recommend the shrimp and sweet and sour pork."}
