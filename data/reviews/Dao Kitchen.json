{"text":"Not a big fan anymore, food was good but has gone down hill as of late.  Ordered take out and they got the order wrong, Shrimp and Lobster was awful, so were the egg rolls and house low mein, over cooked and very oily.  Wonton soup was good but they didn't put the lid on tight enough and spilled all over my back seat.  I won't be going here again."}
{"text":"Living in Arizona, my husband and I seem to be on a never-ending quest for good quality Americanized, and or authentic, Chinese cuisine. As native New Yorkers and from living abroad in Singapore, we have certain expectations when it comes to Chinese food. On a recent search for Chinese restaurants that deliver in this area, I stumbled on Dao Kitchen Asian Bistro, and, when I saw their menu, I was instantly drawn to Egg Foo Young (New York Style). You see, Egg Foo Young has become my foodie test for how good a Chinese restaurant is in Arizona. Unfortunately, the majority of places serve up tiny patties that should be an egg omelette, but have more of a cake-like texture, leaving you to question where the actual egg is. Then, they pile on your choice of pork, chicken, beef, or shrimp, instead of adding it to the actual omelette. So, I was immediately drawn to this 'New York Style' indication in the menu, and knew we had to try Dao Kitchen. 

Last night, we decided to dine in at Dao Kitchen Asian Bistro, and discovered that this is really a great hidden gem in Peoria. The establishment is not fancy, but quite neat and clean. The wait staff is courteous and attentive, our drinks and complimentary Fried Wontons were on the table in less than 5 minutes, and the food we ordered arrived about 10 minutes later. 

We had the House Fried Rice and House Lo Mein, which were both delicious, and the Lo Mein actually reminded us of the La Mein we had at our favorite Chinese restaurant in Singapore. Another dish we ordered was the General Tso's Chicken, and although the chicken was not lightly battered and crispy, it was tender and the sauce was quite similar to that of many restaurants back home in New York. Then, there was Dao Kitchen's Egg Foo Young, which had the boasted being New York Style on the menu, and I am happy to say it did not let me down at all. When the plate of Egg Foo Young with pork arrived at the table, my eyes were treated to three large egg omelettes stacked upon the plate with a bowl of brown sauce. I was teeming with anticipation, and could not wait to taste. The Egg Foo Young was actually egg and not cake-like in texture, and they actually put the pork into the omelette--kudos to the chef! 

Overall, our meal was quite satisfying. The portions are large, and the prices are average. We have definitely found our go-to Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch recently, and ordered the lunch specials. Attentive service, good food (both the kung pao chicken and the szechwan shredded pork were exceptionally tasty), large portions (neither my wife nor I could finish), and very reasonably priced. A good place, and we will certainly revisit when we find ourselves in that 'hood."}
{"text":"I'm dropping my review from a 4 to a 2. Cleanliness and service are a 5 and the taste of the food and portion size is a 4 or 5, but after our last 2 experiences I feel that they use a ton of MSG which is uncool. After consuming just a small portion of our meals, we're overly full and then bloat up and are very uncomfortable for hours. After 3+ years of visiting this establishment, our last 2 visits have left me feeling absolutely miserable and not worth it!"}
{"text":"the food was great.i ordered the chicken and vegetables and it came out hot,fresh,and big in portion size.the pieces of chicken were big and plentiful, not stringy or fatty at all.the brown garlic sauce was amazing too.the service was excellent.
try the pomengranite martini,it's delicious and only cost like $5.75 for a decent size glass made with sky vodka.i expected it to cost $7 or $8 when i saw it,but was pleasantly surprised when the bill came.
the decor is modern,clean and sleek.however the location is kinda drab.it's in a fry's parking lot next to a coffe shop and pizza place.
the hot and sour soup and spring rolls are to die for too.
i definately reccomend this place."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients!  Very reasonably priced.  We had Kung Pao Beef, Chicken with Cashew and Cantonese Pan Fried Noodle.  Everything was very tasty.  As with any Chinese restaurant;  if you want more spicy with your dish, ask for hot chili sauce.  Staff was attentive and friendly.

{"text":"Had the General Tso at lunch and it was very good. It came with a crab puff, spring roll, and rice. I didn't order soup but my husband did. He ordered the Orange Chicken and liked it. We'd eat here again - and probably will."}
{"text":"We got take out here. I had the orange chicken which was pretty good. The fried rice looked like white rice with some soy sauce. No veggies and only a few pieces of egg- pretty disappointing (maybe I ordered wrong) but overall taste was good. My husband had egg drop soup and general tso's chicken. He enjoyed his meal. We will be back here - just probably won't get the fried rice again."}
{"text":"We had to meet someone nearby and needed a bite to eat and it was either this Asian Kitchen or the Italian place next door. I'm glad we went here. The food was fresh and served hot and the service was great . The place looked neat and clean and was very reasonably priced. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Love their Chinese food, very fast service and always tastes great. I get the lomein and the beef and broccoli and it's delicious :)"}
{"text":"Amazing.  Like a machine.
   If authentic food is what you are craving.  If you venture in early,  the fresh produce is being processed right before your eyes. 
  ALWAYS GOOD, ALWAYS FRESH AND AUTHENTIC.
  QUICK, EFFICIENT, FRESH ASIAN CUISINE.
PORTIONS are generous.
FOOD always Hot, even delivery.
 The Obvious Matriach commands response from the cooks.. and staff and gets the order correct.
  Knows Her customers , When I pick up I am Mister of Mrs Extra Sauce! 
   VALUE for money...always leftovers and still great for the second \"heat up\".
   A Hidden Gem in Peoria/Glendale that delivers and \"delivers\" like a pin-point \" accurate home-cooked\" machine."}
{"text":"Great food. Great delivery service. I have not eaten in the restaurant just do take out and delivery."}
{"text":"The orange chicken is some of the best you will ever find. Very delicous. Perfect sauce. The hot and spicy soup was also fantastic. Many of the other entrées are not very good at all (1-3 stars depending on the entrée). If you want orange chicken go here. If you want something else, go somewhere else.

Portions are huge!

Service was above average but the cleanliness of glasses and silverware was below average."}
{"text":"This place has great food!  I love the moo goo gai pan and the orange chicken.  Ask for their homemade hot mustard with your order, it is very good!"}
{"text":"Wow, is all I have to say about this restaurant. From the ordering through the delivery was just amazing! This is the first time I've ordered from here but I knew I had to leave a review. The woman who took the order was very nice and patient, we had a complicated order. She said it would be 45 minutes, it was here within 20 min. I felt like I just got off of the phone! The food was very hot and really, really good. I am so impressed. I haven't had chinese
 food this good since I left Chicago 10 years ago.Awesome place!!"}
{"text":"To start off I give this place an extra half star because they're in the neighborhood that means something to me.   they're also now called the Dao kitchen not Tao.  The food is hot and the help friendly.  Prices are reasonable.  Not great but fine for a simple family dinner."}
{"text":"So today was my last time coming here. Every time I come to this place they either get my order wrong or the wait staff is rude. Today I ordered the lunch special and the waitress orders the dinner. I mentioned it to her and she began to argue with me. I am not into coming to place that every time they make a mistake tells me it's my fault. I am sorry your food isn't that great for me to continue to return when you have poor Customer service. Oh and to top it off our server is the manager Shirley. Wow greats customer service. I don't recommend coming here when there are plenty of other Chinese food place around this area with better service"}
{"text":"We came fr southern California. We crave for authentic Chinese restaurant. This is it. Very clean. Excellent food. We ordered sizzling soup. Green beans n mu-shu"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Granted I have only had the classics like chicken low mein, orange chicken, and fried rice. But the orange chicken is juicy, crispy, and full of flavor. I would definitely recommend. Great service! We got our order in less than 5 minutes!"}
{"text":"The service was great. The staff was friendly. The food wasn't. Bad but it wasn't good. Didn't have much flavor. I wouldn't recommend this place as the food really isn't all that great."}
{"text":"I'm in the process of moving to this area, so I am trying to find new go-to restaurants in all of my favourite foods.... I won't judge a book by it's cover, but I will judge a restaurant by it's clientele, and a Chinese restaurant by it's hot and sour soup. I walked into this place, and it was completely empty. At 6 pm. That should have been my clue to walk back out, but this is the only Chinese within 5 miles of my house.... so I tried it out anyway. I ordered curry chicken, chicken chow fun, and hot and sour soup to go. At home, I tried small portions of each. The good: large portions, they offer brown rice (not a blend), and the chow fun was solid. A little bland, maybe, but solid. The bad: the chicken curry had a really nice flavor, but it contained a lot of potatoes..... ummm. Yes, potatoes. So I've never had potatoes with any Chinese food before, ever. And I eat Chinese food because if you omit the white rice and noodles, it's really easy to eat low carb. Wasn't pleased to find the potatoes. And last, the ugly: you guessed it, the hot and sour soup. NASTY!!! This soup contained shrimp, which isn't unheard of, but the soup is apparently how this restaurant disposes of it's slightly past it's expiration date seafood. I don't love shrimp, and I really don't love fishy-tasting nastiness in my soup. I will not be back. If anyone has suggestions for a better Chinese restaurant west of this one, please let me know!!!"}
{"text":"Dao is the best Chinese in the area. Huge portions for an average price!! I typically call to order and food is ready in 10-15 minutes. There is a nice dine-in lunch special also. Food is wonderful! I would definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"Formerly Tao Kitchen, Dao Kitchen Asian Bistro is a lovely dine-in or take-out place with a decent selection of beers and wines. It's very clean and the staff is attentive and friendly. It's great for take-out and delivery on the weekends when you don't feel like cooking or being around people.

The Mongolian Beef is very good, but the Garlic Chicken has way too much cabbage. Both claim to be spicy dishes but really aren't. The Orange Chicken and the Kung Pao chicken are also very good but lacking in heat. 

In general, the food is good but not very spicy, so if you like heat, you'll have to ask for it or add it yourself."}
{"text":"I will never be back. I was rushed to order when at about 12:30 only three people were at the restaurant. Then when I ordered the lunch special they forgot to bring my soup. Whoever said the hot and sour soup was terrible was dead on. The meat doesn't even taste good in it. 

The orange chicken tasted like ketchup or vinegar. The fried rice was not good. 

The service was rushed and unfriendly. I can go to a place and eat even if the service isn't good.

The food was terrible. The only decent thing I ate was the egg roll and wonton. Not sure if it was just the cook, but even the staff seemed as though they were arguing. 

And to top it off my fortune cookie had no fortune when opened. It seemed as bough it was the icing on the cake. When all and all I am mostly disappointed in my lunch choice."}
{"text":"Had it last night. I was real excited they delivered. I have had Dao a lot but the one on
Carefree hwy. 1st time since I moved I discovered the other location here off Deer Valley.
I was a little sad after I got it, the orange chicken looked like it was the bottom of the bag size of chicken was about the size of 1/2'' squares also I love the grabba goons not to par.
It is nothing like there other location on Carefree they would get 5 stars all the time. I don't see what would be so hard to produce the same thing as the other location."}
{"text":"Stopped in for take out recently.  There was only one couple inside eating.  The workers were happy to see me and greeted me right away.  Another lady came in to pick up.  I placed my order for two dinner entrees that came out to just under $20 and they accept Discover which I loved.  I asked for a glass of water and went to use the restroom.  I came back and sat down at the bar to watch sportscenter while I waited.  A lady came out with some fried won ton chips with sweet and sour sauce and hot mustard.  I thanked her and smiled.  Very nice gesture for a guy who's just getting take out.  I looked around the restaurant.  It was extremely clean and tidy.  Casual but intimate enough for a date.  The lights were all set to dim and the tables were set up perfectly.  The phone rang for another pick up order.  Within a couple of minutes my food was ready.

I ordered my wife a spicy vegetarian dish with cabbage and peanuts and brown rice.  I ordered myself the Cantonese Pan Fried Noodles.  We got home and dug in.  My wife loved hers so much she had me try it.  It had a nice spice to it and everything was brought together with the sauce.  My fried noodles were tasty too.  A mound of noodles covered in vegetables, pork, chicken, and shrimp with a nice brown sauce.  The portions were both large and better than average.  

The only negative was they didn't include spicy chili sauce or hot mustard.  Luckily I had some chili sauce in the fridge but no mustard.  Just a tip to anyone who likes sauce make sure you ask for it before you leave.  I saw it near the to go boxes so just assumed they included it but should have asked.  Now I know.

All in all Tao was A-OK.  I would come back again to try out more of the menu."}
{"text":"I didn't write a review last time because I wanted to come back to see if anything g was different.
Well, no difference. 
Excellent food and service! This is a family run place. The menu is not overwhelming. Great choices for normal folks and vegans. (LOL!!)
Take out orders are well packed and with no worries of it spilling over. 
I recommend the Mongolian Beef and Chow Fun with BBQ Pork. Really delicious!!
Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Love it here by far the best Chinese I've had. Very fresh. They are very attentive and always a smile"}
{"text":"This is the worst service that I ever experienced ordering food at 545pm and 2 hours later still no response.  When I called to check on my order, they said they were delayed which is no excuse and it will take another 20 minutes for my food to arrive.  If you want to be tempted to eat Chinese food without the calories, call here since they will guarantee that you won't eat."}
{"text":"I have hopping this would be good because of the reviews.  I should have walked out when I noticed I was the only one in the restaurant.  I ordered a special with sweet and sour pork and Mongolian beef. The pork smelled bad and it was very dry. The beef was ok but after the smell of the pork you just did not feel like eating anything. So sorry to say we won't be going back to this place. I took the order to go."}
{"text":"Beat chinese spot in 10 miles...REALLY fast delivery, food is always outstanding, service is great, excellent place :)"}
{"text":"I had seen the four starts from my fellow Yelpers and decided to take my wife for dinner the other night.  I had big hopes, especially since it was walking distance from my home.

We were disappointed.  Yes, 'Meh, i've experienced better.' is a good way to put it.  

We were served oil soaked eggroll skins as a snack - awlfu.  

We ordered cocktals that were hevily advertised to then see the waitress reading in a book how to make them.  They were weak and uninspired.

We ordered a special seafood hot pot. Which was ok, but too filled with tofu.

We ordered a Peking pork, which was served with mu shu pancakes and hosin sauce and a whole bunch of celery.  I mean a ton of celery.  Cheap filler?  

We ordered brown rice and fried rice as sides.  When they arrived we could not distinguish one from the other.  We even asked her to confirm, thinking she made a mistake.  No, she confirmed it.  The fried rice had no other veggies or bits of meat or even a browned color.

Sure, i will give it another try, but I have a few more places to try first.

Also note - as of our visit on 9/30/13, they no longer have any happy hour specials or offers."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Great food, great service and fast delivery. Orange chicken is my fav! Will return"}
{"text":"I discovered Tao due to the online reviews and I am glad I did. Tao is delicious. I have ordered there several times now and each time their food has been great, the delivery is very fast and the priced are inexpensive. My favorite is the Cantonese Pan Fried noodle. The crispy noodles with pork, shrimp, fresh veggies etc are so good. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD and service! And cheap! Me and my mother had dinner there and ordered a big appatizer, soup and the walnut shrimp and it was all amazing! So much food at such a good price! The service was amazing too! I never went with out an empty glass but yet the watress was not over bearing. So good!  Can't wait togo back!"}

{"text":"My family gets take-out from this restaurant all the time. They have the best orange chicken ever!  Much better than the other restaurant that shall remain nameless but rhymes with BF Langs. 

Tried the lettuce wraps for the first time tonight and they are awesome. My only concern is I rarely see diners eating in the restaurant. I hope they can survive on take-out alone....."}
{"text":"Great food for an awesome price. Lunch specials are always fresh and nothings sitting around. Servings are large and always filling."}
{"text":"After trying every Chinese restaurant remotely near our neighborhood, we finally made the rounds to Tao Kitchen Asian Bistro and I'm so happy we did!  My family ordered a variety of dishes and appetizers including potstickers, veggie egg rolls, crab puffs, egg flower soup, hot and sour soup, orange chicken, house fried rice, chow mein and sweet and sour pork - a taste of almost everything - and we were very pleased overall.   The egg flower soup could have had a bit more flavor and the potstickers were slightly over-done (definitely \"stuck\" to the pot too long), but everything still tasted nice. Their prices are very reasonable and the atmosphere is comfortable.  We have also had take out and were very pleased with it as well.  Tao Kitchen will certainly be our go-to for Chinese food in the future."}
{"text":"We're from San Diego where great Chinese food is everywhere. This place is probably the best we've had on this side of town. Great lunch specials and the dinners are good as well. Casual atmosphere but nice."}
{"text":"DAO Kitchen on Deer Valley and 83rd ave-Horrible horrible food, not even like chinese food to me. Nasty looking noodles (low main)  are like thick spaggetti pasta  dark in color soaked in soy sauce, egg roll greasy, fried rice was just plain rice and dry (food old and sitting I think) don't waste your money, much better food at Panda and cost less. Ordered delivery told 40 min (OK) arrived in 20 min ???  only honey sesame chic seemed freshly cooked and OK total 24.00 plus tip in the trash!   I am suspect family or friends are infusing positive reviews to over run negative reviews because of the extreme differences.  I know this is a gimmick by companies to thwart the negative reviews. Go ahead and waste your money and then you will know they do not take pride in their food and doubt they would even eat it...must think stupid non asians (also lady taking orders is gruff to talk to) !"}
{"text":"The food at Tao Kitchen is so fresh & always flavorful.  The service is always friendly & helpful as well as speedy. It's great for take out, delivery or dine-in. Not full of dusty gross cliche plastic decorations.  This place is definitely a favorite in my home."}
{"text":"The food was good, portions huge, and there was a good variety on the menu.  However it took us an hour and 12 minutes from arrival to getting our food, even though the place wasn't full.  So worth it for the food quality and portions, but be prepared for a long wait to get it."}
{"text":"It wasn't what I expected. The ambiance kinda sucked - the dining area was small and loud - and we were seated at one of the few booths, crammed in with 2-3 other booths instead of spreading us around the restaurant - so we could hear everybody's conversation and everybody could hear my almost deaf and very loud 75-year-old Dad. The booth seat was annoyingly wobbly, as well. There was no music, so there was an industrial feel. 

The menus were disgusting - sticky stuff between the pages - gross! 

Service was just okay. Wasn't overly pleasant, but not rude. We all got served our main meals a few minutes apart. 

I went here over another place because of the prices on the online menu (found here on yelp). However, the prices were all over a dollar more at the restaurant.

That said, the food was decent. The cream puff and hot and sour soup served with the combos were really good. However I was surprised we weren't offered more sweet and mustard sauce with our spring rolls. (There was one small bowl to share with the fried wontons served as we were seated) Dad had the special Sa Shien (or something like that) which didn't seem to be a real special since it was pretty much the same price as on the menu. He liked it. My husband had the two type of chicken combo (lemon and General Tso) which was good and not your standard. Mine was rice noodles with curry ordered extra spicy. It had a nice turmeric flavor but wasn't served very hot, which was weird because mine came out a few minutes after my husband's. We all had leftovers which they boxed for us.

None of us got sick. So that's a plus right there.

Will I be back? Probably not unless I'm in the neighborhood anyway. The prices should be lower unless they offer more in the way of ambiance and service."}
{"text":"Worth a try!

Nice and New Pretty and Modern with a Bar and reasonably priced wine and beer .

I never had Black Pepper Fish at a Chinese Restaurant so I decided to give it a try and it came out piping hot ( temperature ) with green peppers and onions and mushrooms . The fish ( I think Tilapia ) was nice and moist and light and this dish is listed on the menu as spicy but it was  mild in an easy to eat light brown sauce that had the black pepper taste in the back-round . I liked that you have the option to have brown rice for a fifty cent upgrade charge so I did .

My husband tried the Szechwan Pork it also had a nice vegetable to meat ratio and also the sauce is very light and more mildly flavored than other places we had Szechwan at .

They offer some dishes I haven't seen elsewhere and I didn't have the Kung Pao or the Orange Chicken but the people who sat behind us did and it looked very good .

Our food came out fast and together , all the servers were pleasant .

Three stars is a Very High Rating for Chinese in this Area most I feel are two stars ."}
{"text":"I feel lucky to have a high quality Chinese place like Tao Kitchen within a mile of my home. I am a huge fan of their barbeque pork egg foo young. I could easily make 3 meals out of this dish. There are 3 omelets, a sizable portion of steamed white rice, and a soup bowl of egg foo young sauce.

I also enjoy dining in at Tao. The restaurant is immaculate, the staff is friendly, courteous and attentive. I am a stickler about keeping my beverage full, and they are always on top of it.

Note: Dine in vs. take out, specials that come will not come with soup if taken to go. To go... NO SOUP FOR YOU!"}
{"text":"We tried this for the first time today and now I am hooked! OMG it was so gosh darn yummy!

Pu Pu Plater
Egg roll crispy with a hint of cinnamon 
Beef strip okay no flavor kinda dry
Rib was meaty with a light flavorful BBQ sauce
Wonton was fluffy and light pork was not hard and condensed best I have had
Crab puff was no puff very sad

Soup was fantastic very light savory flavor. Veggies perfectly cooked not soggy or slimy. Cabbage, shrimp, wonton

Sweet sour chicken. Sauce came on the side. Was crunchy and had Real chicken in it.  Was not a ball of batter. More chicken then batter.  

Shrimp and veggies. Veggies were amazing. The snow peas and celery had some crunch and the broccoli was not crunchy and not soggy just the way unlike it. Shrimp good. Sauce was packed with flavor and not over powering I could have licked the bowl... If I could have finished the HUGE portion! 

Orange chicken. Wow! This was not a ball of battered chicken in a mushy mess of sauce like many places.  It was thinly sliced chicken with a slight crunch. Sauce was not spicy but had wonderful flavor. 

We ordered a side of soft noodles for my toddler and he loved them. 

Take out only took 15 minutes and we ordered ahead on the phone

Nicely packaged nothing leaked from the take out container."}
{"text":"I really was hoping this was a great restaurant, since I live just around the corner.  The teriyaki chicken was dry and very plain. The Mongolian beef wasn't spicy at all and had more sauce and onions was over kill.  The sizzling rice soup, had no water chestnuts, and  the rice that goes on top of soup was completely burnt.   I paid 30.00 and was very disappointed."}
{"text":"Great place for fresh Chinese food. The prices for all the dishes were very reasonable.
It's an open restaurant so you can see everybody in the whole restaurant, but I didn't expect much for a strip mall bistro.
A lot of customers were coming in for takeout.
Be very patient if you dine in. The service is a bit slow,but the food & prices are well worth the wait.
Order the house specialties,they are delish and again the prices on them are also inexpensive."}
{"text":"Dao Kitchen is definitely my favorite Chinese cuisine in the Peoria area. I always get my Chinese fix here. I have been here probably 10+ times. I've gotten orange chicken, almond chicken, and sesame chicken- all super good! Fried rice is great! If you eat in-restaurant, the chips and sauce are awesome as a chips&salsa-like appetizer. Orange chicken is done in a really different way than what I have ever seen but I really like it! It's a bit different but it's pretty yummy! 

Delivery and take-out are fast and fresh! I love how fast I can order and get my food! 

Also, this last time I was there I got an order of orange chicken, rice, and egg drop soup (also yum!) for $18. I ate  4 meals out of it! Definitely worth it to me as a college student!!"}
{"text":"Food was just alright, but incredibly friendly staff. Affordable prices, just not the taste I was hoping for! I got the orange chicken lunch, so maybe a different item would be better."}
{"text":"Clean and fast. All the take-out staples that you would expect. We like the fried rice and garlic chicken. I can't give it five stars only because although tasty....it wouldn't hurt to flavor it up a little. I have to add seasoning or soy or something to get it just right."}
{"text":"I love Dao Kitchen! The service could be slightly improved, but the food is always amazing! The portions are better than average and always fill me up. I would recommend to DINE IN. The food is amazing when served fresh and hot! The prices are average when compared to others and you get a great value. I recommend the orange chicken!"}
{"text":"These stars are for cleanliness and for OK taste. Zero stars for customer service. I walked in happy with my small talk, the lady in charge wasn't understanding a word I was saying, then she asked what I was looking for. Then I asked is that was a restaurant, she said yes, and I told her: \"OK, then I'm looking for food.\" I was about to leave based on her rude gestures, but I was hungry. Throughout my meal I completely stayed quiet, so she kind of toned it down a bit. Maybe it's a cultural thing, who knows. Some people are always on the defensive. I stayed, I tasted and that's my rating."}
{"text":"Dao Kitchen is great no doubt about it. Amazing tasting orange chicken (my favorite)and always getting orders right."}
{"text":"Great Food - Fast Service - I have been coming here for the last five years have never been let down"}
{"text":"One star, one word...gross.
The BBQ pork tasted microwaved, the chow fun was oily, thick and tasted like old oil. I wanted to like this place because they deliver and there aren't a ton of Chinese places around here, but I can't eat food that is just flat out bad."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday for lunch and for $6.95 I got a HUGE plate of orange chicken with rice and it came with a cream cheese won-ton and egg roll.  I split the plate and actually got 2 meals out of it!  Did I mention the orange chicken was awesome!  It makes Panda Express look like well...Panda Express.  The chicken does not have a huge amount of breading and the orange sauce was delish.  The atmosphere is pretty nice for being in a grocery store strip mall.  It is full service dining or take out and they even deliver.  I highly recommend this place and will going back again soon."}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was delicious.  Hot and sour soup was really tasty and full of flavor. We had the usual chinese double of Mongolian Beef and Kung Pao shrimp. We loved both dishes and will definitely stop by again when in the area."}
{"text":"When looking at Chinese food places close to the house we found this gem. I've learned to be wary of \"yelpers\" who don't upload a photo (also note one of these 1 star reviewers posted the SAME review on another nearby Chinese food place, word for word) We come here about 2-3 times a month. We try something new every time and always are satisfied, never get any tummy aches, and reasonably priced. My favorite is the Orange beef, his favorite the black pepper beef. I REALLY like their cream cheese crab puffs. The staff is friendly and don't constantly bug you while you're eating, very peaceful, but they are still attentive. They may have a new name from before but whatever they're doing it keeps us coming. So far we've tried just about everything on the menu nothing has disappointed us so far, best Chinese on the north west side of the valley. Note* Yelp needs to have an option to flag false posts JS"}
{"text":"Unfortunately tonight was a bad night I've always had their House lo mein and I love it unfortunately this evening I had ordered their orange chicken I have had their orange chicken there for lunch and it is delicious unfortunately having a delivered it is like having soggy fried chicken just gross I called and asked if there is something that they could do unfortunately they replied by saying no ! Their customer service is great as long as you do not complain if you have a complaint they seem to think you have a problem and that is when the problem started I've been dealing with this restaurant for years and I am only giving them great reviews the one time I ever complain all of a sudden I become a problem make sure you never complain if you do good luck to you"}
{"text":"Decent chinese at decent prices. They do not skimp on ingredients and portions are generous. And they deliver within 3-4miles!

Potstickers were well prepared but the filling lacked flavor. Could not tell if they were homemade or not. Singapore noodles had tons of curry flavor with a nice amount of heat from the pepper flakes. And while I applaud their effort at trying to make it less oily, it was actually too dry lending the noodles to be \"powdery\" from the curry powder. Lots of bbq pork and not enough egg adds to the dryness. The chow fun noodles was the best dish I had. Good flavor and tasty beef. Just wish the noodles were firmer and pan-fried a little longer to add some needed crispness/crunch. 

Overall--worth the phone call but doubt I would ever visit."}
{"text":"The food was pretty terrible and the service was just OK. There are many other Chinese and Thai restaurants in the  area to choose from"}
{"text":"Mediocre, at best.  Close to my house and had good reviews, so I gave it a try. Spicy King Pao Chicken, not very spicy and chicken tasted reheated. Egg Foo Young tasted a little burnt and sauce tasteless. Egg rolls and white rice.  I will need to find another Chinese restaurant ."}
{"text":"Terrible food, terrible service.  Got delivery tonight, extremely disappointing! Sweet and Sour pork was fried to a burned crisp(a nugget of pork inside) and WAY too many onions on the Mongolian Beef!  We asked for chopsticks at delivery and they said that was something we needed to request ahead of time?! Front staff lady(southern accent and older) was extremely rude to me on the phone.  I regrettably tipped the to go person $5 on our order.  I complained to the restaurant about the food and they argued with me telling me the best offer they could give me was next time free sweet and sour pork, no thanks.  We been coming here for awhile because of the convenience, but even with the free credit we will not take them up on the offer.  The food sucks and so does the service.  Last time I checked, it you didn't like the food or were dissatisfied they should refund the money.  I would gladly send it back in a box.  No customer service at all.  You lost costumer and gained a bad review, we will never be back."}
{"text":"I've lived near this place for 11 years. In that time it's been several different names of a Chinese restaurant. Right now it's actually called Dao not Tao. 
Last night I ordered delivery from them and was incredibly disappointed. I got the spring rolls, crab puffs, orange chicken and Mongolian beef. It was edible but that's about it. The beef had more white onions than anything else which really killed any possibility of flavor. The orange chicken was blah as well. Only bright side were the spring rolls and crab puffs. However for the prices they charge the flavor should be much better. Needless to say I won't be ordering from them again just not worth over paying for blah food."}
{"text":"Worst food!! I ordered Kung Pao Shrimp to go and got stale chicken. Also ordered Tofu family style which was over cooked"}
{"text":"I have been getting take out from this restaurant for years and it is always great. My boys and I absolutely love the orange chicken and the vegetable Lo mein is good too."}
{"text":"I called in a Take-Out order about 20 minutes before they closed.  I ordered curry chicken and when I got it home, about half way through eating it I noticed there was NO chicken.  Are you serious?  How does that happen?  I was hoping some of the potato clumps might actually be chicken, but no such luck.  The curry sauce tasted like it was made from a powder base that wasn't dissolved very well.  I ended up throwing away the second half.  First and last adventure with Tao."}
{"text":"The portions were very big!  Staff was friendly!  Food was good!  Win, win, win...easy as that."}
{"text":"Not impressed, at all. We just moved to the neighborhood and thought we would try this for an easy take out meal. My husband ordered the teriyaki chicken, I ordered the sweet and sour chicken, and we got fried rice for our toddler. The teriyaki chicken smelled awful and tasted even worse. It was not edible. It tasted like the sauce was probably burned, for a long time and the 'grilled' chicken looked like the bagged pre-cooked kind you get at the grocery store. The broccoli it came with was alright, in comparison. The sweet and sour chicken was ok. The fried rice was just soy sauced rice with a scrambled egg piece here and there. Bland enough for my kid, I guess. My husband mentioned they weren't that nice when he went to pick up our food. Safe to say we will not be returning. P.S. The prices listed on their website, for the Peoria location, were not correct as far as for what we ordered. We were charged $1 more for each item."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed nor was my hubby. I just didn't think my chicken dish had any flavor. In fact, I doctored it up before I ate it. Never before have I had to fix up the flavor of my Chinese food!"}
{"text":"Yet again I am disappointed with Arizona's selection of ethnic food. Well, maybe its just the Glendale/Peoria area. 

Had the chicken chow mein and beef broccoli with added veggies. Noodles were way too soft, practically \"mushy\" and both items were extremely greasy. The beef was tender but you could taste the MSG in everything. Good sized portions but I wouldn't pay the price again for the quality. Probably won't come back here, would rather eat at PF Changs (even though its not real chinese food)."}
{"text":"I ordered over the phone 45 mins prior to them closing and the food I got didn't seem fresh like as it was the leftovers. Bad food quality, decent customer service, I had a hard time ordering over the phone because she and I had to repeat many things to each other. Overall was not happy with the food and the price for what I paid for"}
{"text":"I was so excited they delivered! UNTIL.... The lady who answers the phone and takes the togo orders is very, very nice and well spoken. I called first to see the delivery area and she said yes, they deliver to my area. So I called back after we knew what we wanted. She took our order and informed me it would be about 45min to an hr. She also said the driver had a card machine and would take payment then. Roughly 25min later she called back letting me know there was another driver and they did not have a machine, so she took it over the phone, then informed me the food was on its way. 35 min goes by and I decided to call. The driver got lost and had to go back and look at the map... When she finally arrived almost 2 hrs after I placed the order, I didn't quite understand her, but she informed me it was too far, the lady on the phone doesn't know the delivery areas and they only deliver to the apartments up the street, not the houses. its total 5.6 miles away. Our food was needless to say, not warm but just about cold and they missed an item and had something else in the box. Disappointing... Wish it was a different experience, we would moist likely order here quite a bit. The food was good after we warmed it up, would've been better an hr prior im sure."}
{"text":"We've had takeout from Dao a few times, a solid choice and good for that Chinese food fix. The classics - fried rice, lo mein, orange chicken, beef with snow peas, sweet and sour pork, curry chicken, all solid. Nothing particularly outstanding (yet?), but no duds either. 

They did have crab puffs, but they were a bit disappointing - the pastry squares folded over into triangles and not gathered in a flower pattern by the corners like I'm used to - lent to less crispy texture, made then feel undercooked, and the flavor is spread out flat throughout and doesn't have that crispy pop like I'm used to - just an underwhelming version of what I usually consider a highlight. 

Totally will be back though. And this is only for takeout - haven't dined in yet, could be a different experience."}
