{"text":"This is one of the better Indian buffet restaurants in the GTA. The quality and taste is very good and the price is reasonable. Supper is $14.99, so I have no idea why it is rated at $$$$? It is not strong on dessert, but the main dishes and soup are always very tasty. They bring fresh nan to your table. If you know of a better Indian dinner buffet, I would sure like to know, because I travel all the way from North York for this one."}
{"text":"Taste good Service is good Staff are friendly Nice place Clean Good price Also delivery"}
{"text":"I checked this place out a couple of months ago. It's a teeny buffet with not a whole lot of items on the menu. Good value but I guess your experience here heavily depends on when you visit. When I had dinner here, the food was definitely not fresh. The chicken had a gamey taste and there were no fresh naans available once we were out. There weren't enough plates or spoons available! I did, from what I recall, like their dessert and I'm willing to give this place another try at a different time of the day."}
{"text":"The decor of this place is extremely simple. That being said, it is a buffet restaurant so one should not expect much going in.  The food overall is pretty appetizing and not just for buffet standards. What they lack in variety, they make up for in taste which is more than I can say for most other Indian restaurants, buffet or not. However, being a buffet, there are bound to be things that people won't like and I am no exception to that rule. I thought the appetizers were lacking in variety but there were plenty of dishes for the main course. I didn't care much for the deserts. They have have a separate bar to order whatever drinks people desire which I thought was an interesting concept for a buffet restaurant.  The service was adequate."}
{"text":"We tried this place as part of the Dine Out Calgary promotion, where we received a three course meal at Sahara for $35 each. It was worth it. I had the kebabs (beef and chicken) that actually made me a fan of Lebanese cuisine. The potatoes were seasoned with a great blend of herbs.... For an appetizer, my girlfriend had the hummous, fatayer (dough, filled with spinach) and warak enab (vine leaves with rice and veggies) which she said were terrific. The dessert was where things got a little weird. I don't eat dessert as a rule; I'd rather have another beer and a cigarette, but I think I hurt the server's feelings by not having the baklava. We both aren't fans of it, but my girlfriend took it to be polite, I assume. However, I am a rude man who doesn't like sweet desserts..... Anyway, the Sahara has fantastic authentic Lebanese cuisine in a nice little, classy restaurant. The service was great; the waitress took pride in her work and the food and that kind of stuff is refreshing. Sahara is a great place for dinner, but they also offer lunch. Check it out......"}
{"text":"Wow, really realllllly good food! My husband and I shared the veggie plate, along with a side of yogurt, grape leaves, and naan. Everything was amazing and delicious! The service was also impeccable, they are the nicest people. I can't say enough positive things about this place. Just GO and see for yourself! And definitely try the hummus and baba! :)"}
{"text":"Horrible, horrible food. Don't waste your money here. The food is cold and stinky. I was really disappointed. Service is bad too. The lady stares at you from behind the counter, making it very uncomfortable to eat."}
{"text":"As its a buffet so u might not probably get everthing 100 percent. The things tht i liked were tandoori chicken and kabobs but the biryani was not up to the mark! The dahi bhallas were old not fresh and shahee tukra was very oily. On the whole its a good place to have dinner with family"}
{"text":"Very delicious food!  My father has taken me here on two occasions. Both times were excellent. I got the Mensaf and it was AWESOME. The service is very personal and friendly. You're treated as family. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I moved back to Cleveland from Detroit four years ago and have been searching for a good Middle Eastern restaurant.  My search has ended!  This place is fabulous!  From their garlic sauce down to the seasoning she uses.  I would highly recommend this restaurant to all!"}
{"text":"I have tried many Indian buffet restaurants in Brampton, Mississauga and Markham. Sahara is my favourite Indian buffet restaurant. Friendly staff, good selection of delicious food and value!"}
{"text":"We used to love coming here for excellent Lebanese style food. Sadly, Sahara is no more. Shut down and the space taken by another restaurant. What a pity."}
{"text":"Where to begin. This place was great in like 2006, 2008, now that's a memory. The inside of the place looks like an episode of hoarders. No menu in the place is current and the worker argued with me that tabouleh doesn't get bread, you eat it with a fork.  Stick to Pakistani food"}
{"text":"So when I first got back into town, my parents took me out for a lovely dinner at Sahara. Lovely because of the company; Alright because of the food.  Sahara is a cute little restaurant right in downtown Calgary. It's conveniently located right by a BEAUTIFUL path so you can take an evening promenade by the river if you eat a little too much.  The food at Sahara is your traditional Middle Eastern fare. I'm talking Kabobs, Hummus, Fatayers, Baba Ghanoush and Schawarma. When I did go there, I was absolutely famished and so the option of having an appetizer as dinner just wasn't going to cut it. The thing I found a little disappointing about Sahara was that the only vegetarian entree dish they had was a vegetarian platter of the Chef's favourites. I was quite shocked because usually most Middle Eastern places will have a nice vegetarian couscous entree at the very least.  I hear the meat dishes were quite good, but again, I would have enjoyed my visit much more if they broadened their vegetarian entree selections.  Sahara is an A-OK dining experience if you're an amateur 'Middle Eastern Cuisine Eater'. If you know your Middle Eastern food, then there are better places in Calgary to eat."}
{"text":"We did a private event there and the lady gave us one rate at the beginning and then a lot of extra costs suddenly came in when it came time to settle our bill.  I would recommend that u get everything in writing before entering in an agreement with them.  Buyer beware."}
{"text":"\"Meh. I've experienced better.\" is the perfect way to describe Sahara.    The buffet selection is small (about 10 dishes), the Naan wasn't very fresh the day I went, the dessert selection was small, and the quality of food was average.    My friends and I were the only patrons there for lunch on a Wednesday, so maybe the low turnover rate is the reason the Naan wasn't fresh, but now I'm just making excuses for them.   There's nothing distinctively \"bad\" per se, but I just don't think there's anything \"great\" or \"good\" about this place either.   I don't remember the price of the lunch buffet, I suppose like the rest of the buffet it was forgettable (zing!).  I work in this vicinity so I've tried nearly all the Indian buffets in the area, and my vote goes to either \"The Host\" (not a big selection, but good naan and the food quality is one of the best as far as Indian buffets go) at Square One, or \"Tandoori Flame\" (A much larger selection, but it is a bit far from this location. Then again who doesn't love long lunches).   If you're just in this area, looking for some good food and enjoy Mexican food, then I'd go right next door to El Sombrero, which is in the same plaza and has some excellent Mexican dishes."}
{"text":"This place is great. All of the food is delicious. Why is it so slow on a Saturday?  Some of the best falafels I have eaten anywhere.  The curry is incredible.  Hummus, baba, and tabouli were also delicious."}
{"text":"Nice place. We went for a weekday lunch buffet at 11:30am at opening. They were prepared with all of their food so we didn't have to wait long. All of the dishes were tasty and well spiced. It was not overly hot or intimidating. I like that they make a genuine effort to reduce waste. Also the restaurant had a nice dining environment. It was clean with nice decor.  I hope to one day see the banquet hall."}
{"text":"One of the best Pak-indian restaurant in GTA. Sahara has exquisite cuisine and very large selection of Tandoori (BBQ) specials. I love tempura fried fish, Biryani, palak paneer, kulfi... etc.  Price is 16.99 for dinner buffet which is very reasobale according to their food quality. I wouldn't mind paying a bit more for quality food other then find myself suffering from low quality food."}
{"text":"As far as Indian/Pakistani fare is concerned, Sahara puts together a damn good buffet for both lunch and dinner (at $12 and $16, respectively). They have probably the worst location known to man, tucked away in the back corner of a strip mall that is made entirely of restaurants, but you can still see it from Hwy 10, which is good, I suppose. Their food is fantastic - they have a large assortment of cold salads (potato, chickpea, garden salad) and I think on any given night they have at least 10 different types of curries and other entree dishes. Their naan bread is fantastic and they also have unlimited quantities of papadums, which are also delicious. They've got a dessert section of the buffet for those of you who like sweets, but I tend to shy away from them.   The one thing that this place lacks is service. I know it's a buffet, and you're not supposed to expect fantastic service at a buffet, but the fact that you're getting your own food means that the servers have less to do than at most joints, so the LEAST they should be able to do is get your drinks right and in a timely manner. My mother asked for tea one time and it took 10 minutes for them to get it to her and when they did, it wasn't right because they had no tea bag! Isn't tea a staple of the Indian culture? how can they mess that up? Last time we went, my Mom ordered hot water with lemon and the woman brought her hot tap water! I then clarified and asked her to bring boiling water, like the kind they'd use for tea, and that again took about 10 minutes.   This place would easily be 4-stars, or perhaps my favorite indian buffet in the west end if they had better service, but it's bad enough that I'd doc it a star.   Nonetheless, go for the food and know that your service is going to suck and you'll walk away happy."}
{"text":"couple of weeks ago i have been to Sahara best price for a buffet and the service is really good"}
{"text":"I'm typing on behalf of the Rexdale location! The customer service is amazing! The guy was really nice and gave recommendations, which I adore. I ordered beef seekh kabob with basmati rice and salad. It was so delicious, but it was a bit more spicy then I expected.. I didn't really care because the beef was so tender it was literally melting in my mouth and the spices they used was amazing.  Definitely re-ordering this. I love Indian/Pakistani food and I seen they have butter chicken and lamb karahi and all sorts of curries and lamb briyani.. so I definitely feel safe ordering more on the heavier side, they seem like they know what they are doing. Try the one in Etobicoke/Rexdale area. Again.. I recommend, lol"}
{"text":"I left wanting more flavour, selection and taste. Nothing extraordinary here but they were nice enough to make fresh naan as the one sitting in the hot plate buffet was stale."}
{"text":"The prior review I wrote for Sahara is listed under restaurant name \"Sahara International\" and this is the new listing. My family has been coming here for years and have yet to have a bad experience. The mixed meat combo platter is my usual. It is my favorite kafta in the city. Not too overwhelming with the spices. This is important if you want to go out afterwards because people don't always appreciate kafta burps. The service is always outstanding. I love this family run operation. They could not be more nice and welcoming to guests. This is my favorite sit down Mediterranean cuisine spot in the city."}
{"text":"Tonight I went to Sahara again after few times I had lunch and dinner in there . But today the food a bit dry and few time I got electricity shock every time I touch the ladle to take the food from hot table or maybe just the weather ...I'm not sure.  But anyway .... normally the food are most and fresh. ..today is not so much . Plus the note for the food is not match. On the note is butter chicken but in hot table I think is kinda beef curry. The desserts is not make us like to try it , they like old look and so depressed.  The restaurant it self look need good clean up ...the carpet look so tired after so many years in that place. I didn't see much guess in there also. The waiter , he is so nice . He asking how the food and I informed him that the food is dry. So for 2 adult and 1 child is $40.86 is to pricy for all of that."}
