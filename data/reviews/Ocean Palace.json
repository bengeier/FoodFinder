{"text":"This place needs some cleaning!!!!!! We tried it because of the great reviews , the buffet was gross, the hibachi chicken was not bad, but just eating it in that dirty place wasn't pleasant."}
{"text":"The restaurant has a few really good dishes. The hibachi shrimp or steak is the best in town. The shrimp+chicken lettuce wrap is awesome. Not to mention their teriyaki chicken sticks -- they are uniquely marinated and taste totally great. This owners of this family restaurant are very friendly and attentive. We have visited the restaurant many times and kept going back."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! The food is amazing, take out or buffet. The waitress is very nice, and she knows my preferences. Try the seam chicken and lo mein, they're cooked just how I like it. The price is affordable, and your getting your money's worth. The restaurant is a little hard to find, it's a tiny little place. The parking lot is empty because there are mostly call-in orders."}
{"text":"Buffet isn't that great, but the take out is awesome.  I highly recommended for take out."}
{"text":"Great food, good prices. I don't go anywhere else for my hibachi. They have generous portions and don't water down their shrimp sauce like other places. This place is definitely a hidden gem within Fort Mill. Highly recommended but I believe owner says they're closing for good on June 29th. Will miss the good food and family that runs this place."}
{"text":"Not the best place to dine-in, but the take out is the best in town! Try to look past the Scenery and its a great place!"}
{"text":"This place is a rundown shack. The buffet had no food. 3 pieces of fries. 2 broccolis. It was pretty much empty. We left because it was a joke. Just awful .."}
{"text":"The lunch buffet was greasy and unappetizing. At least it was cheap!
The dining room and restaurant are run down and shabby.
Maybe it's better for dinner?"}
{"text":"Nice little restaurant. Nothing fancy or incredible but consistently good food and friendly service. Also generous portions  Don't let the outside of the building fool you. The pork dumplings and chickens steamers are good."}
{"text":"I will give this place a 5 star for two reasons. #1 is the outstanding service that we get every time we visit Ocean Palace. Athena and her family are very friendly and have always gave us the best service. Yes, there is a limited choice on the buffet however, if you let them know which option on the buffet you prefer, they will always make it fresh for you. We've been there during their slow time and as soon as we walk in, since we are what you at call regulars, always make our favorites fresh for us. 
#2 is the quality of the hibachi menu and their carry out. Their hibachi menu, if at a \"more visually appealing\" location, could easily charge twice their menu price."}
{"text":"From the looks on the outside, you think nope, no and no thanks but if you dare to venture in you'll find that the food is moderately decent and not weighted down with extras that make you feel bloated and hating yourself. The buffet for me is always a no go because I know some people do not wash their hands and have no consideration for others who are using utensils after them. If you're in the area you will probably enjoy the meal but the decor has left feeling like I'm taking a chance each time I eat."}
{"text":"Yuck. If you a construction worker who doesn't mind smelling like rancid grease, this is just the place for you.  Walked out. Did I say yuck? Yuck!"}
{"text":"Tired of chain restaurants? This husband-wife owned hole-in-the-wall serves up great spice and tasty Asian food for dinner. My husband and I shared a hibachi plate and an authentic Chinese chicken dish. We can't wait to bring more people here."}
{"text":"I've passed this place several times to and from work and the outside appearance has always made me doubtful.  After thoroughly reading the reviews I finally decided to give it a try.  I ordered the Hibachi shrimp and steak with extra shrimp and the steamed pork dumplings to go.  I finally get home and tried the food and it was delicious!  It was quick, friendly and the food was hot.  They now have a new customer.  I will surely return to order again!"}
{"text":"Don't even....NO!  Words cannot really describe the lunch buffet.  The parking lot is empty for reason...enough said!"}
{"text":"The food is AWESOME. Everything we've ever ordered from here is fantastic. It's not the place to go for ambiance, but It's family owned, which we love, and the service is quick and the staff is so hospitable! The portions are large too. This is where we always get take out when we want Asian food in this area.  Hibachi or Chinese style, I would recommend this place over and over."}
{"text":"I have no idea why we've never been there before, but we tried them out for dinner on a whim last night, and really enjoyed the food!  The veggies were fresh and crunchy, the shrimp and scallops in our Happy Family were perfectly cooked, and the crab rangoon and plum sauce tasted homemade.  The prices are great, too!  Now we know that we have good Chinese within walking distance of our house, we'll be back often."}
{"text":"I only had the lunch buffet and I am sure 3 pm is not the best (freshest) time to go. The price was legit for what I had. Service was great, food, well it was your typical buffet nothing special stood out but several items were quite tasty."}
{"text":"Food was so greasy and oily... Please check before you eat here, worst Buffet I ever had, you are going to puke for sure After you eat here...that's what it happened to me"}
