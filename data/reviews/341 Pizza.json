{"text":"I was craving pizza and this was conveniently in the area. It was good except a bit stingy on the toppings."}
{"text":"The pizza is actually really good! I don't know where he gets the cheese from but it tastes super fresh, and the slices are big. I've been going there for a while and I think I can consider it to be the best pizza place around that area. Even better than Pizza Pizza and Little Caesars up the street."}
{"text":"This pizza is amazing. I'm usually very picky about pizza...I don't like sauce in general. I'm always tempted to get my pizza with no sauce.  Anyway, I love the cheese. The cheese reminds me of pizza from home (I'm from Trinidad). The toppings were generous and the dough was well cooked. I felt like it was a little pricey but considering the taste it was definitely worth it. The delivery was very prompt, no issues with my order. It was a beautiful pie :) We are about to order again right now....lol Our standard order is a large pizza with pepperoni, ground beef, bacon and pineapple on half. Thus far this is my favourite place to order from...hell I'm just picky period! Haha yum!"}
{"text":"The best chain pizza you will eat. A happy group of Afghan ex-pats who now love Canada  provide great pizza a great price."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place since I was small and its still the same owners. They always have good pizza and wings. You can't go wrong with their honey garlic chicken wings. All their pizzas are really good. Walk-in special for a large 3 topping pizza is $9.99. Prices are always good. Only downside is they have a very small seating area."}
{"text":"I've been going here since I was kid best piZza best wings honey garlic.. The food is great! For the price"}
{"text":"This place has the best wings by far. I usually go to bars to eat wings, but this is my favorite take out spot. The wings remind of a bar in Toronto called Crown and Dragon. Their honey garlic wings are to die for!! I love the sauce. Their pizza is OK, but i usually only get the wings. Their garlic finger are also very good. I would defiantly recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I come here often, and they are always changing the price. (Not the same price they advertise!)  Also, this one time I ordered a large pizza only to get a medium. Pizza is good though."}
{"text":"Its all about the wings baby.   Hey the pizza is good but its the wings that make this joint special.  That BBQ sauce is sweet and tangy and messy and thats how good wings should be.  The other night I grabbed 2 of their deal for a medium pie and wings and that rocks my world for a fair price.  When i got home i was in heaven with the hockey game, a  few good friends, and wings and pizza.  So the leafs are not a winning team, but the pizza and wings are."}
{"text":"In my travels or while i pass this place quite often since its in the same plaza as the UPS store and the closest pharmacy to my place, so why not give it a shot.  Its cheap pizza, its pretty good too.  I was surprised, in a good kind of way.  Now the wings, thats the good stuff.  They are tasty and and prepared while you wait.  They have specials where you can get pizza wings and drinks so we like to grab a pie, and some wings to go, and relax at home on those cold winter nights when you just dont want to go out.  Its all good here.  Cheap, tasty and fresh is a winning combination."}
{"text":"I read the reviews and made a late night delivery order. I can tell you the delivery was the only good part - the pizza was merely edible - it was very very bland, the crust lacked flavour and the wings were just ok. I ate 2 slices that night and tossed the rest of the pizza. 

It's so disappointing when you read amazing reviews and your expectations are for good food which then promptly disappoints."}
{"text":"The best pizza in sauga. Hands down. Its amazing. Been coming since elementary school aswell and its just the best thing ever."}
{"text":"The plain BBQ wings here are AMAZING!!!! Definitely among the most scrumptious wings I've ever devoured! However, in saying that, the pizza is just alright....kinda don't like how most of the toppings are in the centre of the pizza, I mean, is it really that difficult to spread the toppings out a little more?!?!?"}
{"text":"Wow! Wow! Wow! Late night delivery order and we were impressed! Amazing flavour, perfect cook and super friendly service! 

I'd give these guys a try! So pleased we will order from them again."}
{"text":"This place is my go to neighborhood pizza place. My family orders from here on a weekly basis and they have never disappointed us! The price is fantastic for the high quality delicious pizza you get, and the wings are made to perfection (particularly the honey garlic coated wings). but beware the spicy wings are REAL spicy (still delic though). Additionally their service is amazing and punctual, and their family atmosphere will definitely draw your back here again and again. Since coming to this place four years ago, we have never visited a chain pizza store since! A+"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was in elementary school (15 years ago) they have the most amazing pizza and pizza dough you can ever get!!! Absolute secret place that I am sharing only because I'm buzzed."}
{"text":"Just waited an hour and a half for 20 wings. No pizza. Just 20 wings at 2pm on a weekday.. in the afternoon... can't be that busy. Kept being told 5 mins. They call me back tell me they cannot come up so i have to come down to the driver. I come downstairs and wait for 30 minutes and no. One showed. They kept telling me five minutes and showed up two hours after i had placed my order. I sent back the food and went elsewhere."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.. I mean really, genuinely.. but I don't get all the hype? Seriously guys.. you know I like good food and good pizza.. I'm not saying this place is horrible but I'm not sure if I would get pizza from here again.. I gave it 3 stars because of the customer service and nice and quick/friendly delivery but there was just something missing.. I found it a bit bland.. I was expecting more flavor because of the reviews but meh.. Anyways. Here's what I ordered:

Large 3 topping pizza with: Chicken, Anchovies (lol) and onions witg extra sauce and cheese (just in case they are stingy) - The pizza is definitely fresh but it sort of lacked flavor.. I ordered this Pizza because of good reviews and I didn't get what I expected..

Garlic fingers with cheese - they were OK.. I've had better

Half of suicide wings (not horribly spicy but good spicy) and I got honey garlic wings (the honey garlic wings were way more crispier then the spicy ones, oddly) - Both I still enjoyed and they aren't Jumbo Gross Hormone injected looking wings, they are decent size which I like but I've had better and people were raving about the wings.. still decent.

Overall.. I'm not sure if I'd order again from here.. so many other pizza joints that, that is the least of my worries but my oh my.. I really wanted to like this place as I repeat. I Love the prices though. Maybe it's for you but it's not for me. I recommend for quantity and prices but for flavor? I'm not sure how to put it in words."}
