{"text":"Not a very clean place. This is the first impression when you walk in here. Staff aren't friendly either. Very hard to get their attention when you need them. 

Food is average. The only thing that I like on the menu is Satay Beef vermicelli. 

Never expected much every time I come here. Only come here when it's a friend's request or when we ran out of option."}
{"text":"This is my favourite place for Chinese breakfast! It's cheap and I think the quality of the food is the best out of the other HK cafes in the area. They also have a great set lunch which includes soup, a hot and fresh chinese dinner roll, entree, drink and jello dessert. I highly recommend the sizzling steak with black peppercorn sauce, it's excellent!! The service is also very quick and friendly. I took one star off though, because the restaurant is pretty small and it's not the most comfortable place to sit, and it's cash only."}
{"text":"Love their breakfast, love their sizzling platters. 

Quick friendly service. 

Food is good not great."}
{"text":"$10 lunch special gets you a nice bowl of soup (borscht all the way for me!), a sizzling entree platter (a must when you're here), a drink (nice HK style milk tea compared to many places) and a dessert (no choice here so I got served a strawberry jello). So here's the breakdown:

Borscht soup: 4/5 
Fried Chicken Sizzling Plate with garlic sauce: 4/5
Milk tea drink: 4/5
Jello: 1/5 (at least it's not 0/5?)

Great place to eat when you're starving and low on dough. Waitresses sure do look bored though, with the exception of one lady who mentioned she started working there only about a week. I guess with another week she'll start looking like one of her walking dead colleagues? Anyway, 4 star for Goldsor!"}
{"text":"Decor 3 - 15%
Service 2 - 15%
Price 4 - 20%
Taste 2 - 50%

Total 2.5 - I round the score down to 2 and here is why:

A Hong Kong style fast food cafe with prices lower than many other similar local places. Typical decor that is a little dated with typical service level that is anything other than impressive.

The 2 of us sat down and was told that the cafe just started their new business hours - closing at 7pm daily and stopped serving dinner.  Then the waitress pointed out to the entrance to try to show us their notice - a letter size paper printed with probably a 16 point font.  We were served with afternoon tea menu.

We ordered curry brisket on rice and shredded chicken and ham with cream sauce on spaghetti.  The curry was under seasoned and bland.  And the cream sauce was also under seasoned.  Spaghetti was way over cooked with small portions compared to other afternoon tea menu from other cafes.  We did not finish the dishes.

I can't think of a reason why I should be back.  And this is how I would recommend this cafe to others."}
{"text":"The food is ok for what you pay for but I really hate eating there because it's soooooooo noisy!  The staff screams and all you hear is the echo of voices and cutlery being thrown into bins.  I get a headache everytime I eat there."}
{"text":"LUNCH

Haven't been here since my last review in 2012. Wow, how time flew! 

This place hasn't changed ANYTHING since my last visit. The waitress even had the same vegetable stuck in between her teeth from 6 years ago. TIMELESS.

With that said, We ordered the baked Portuguese chicken combo (now $3.75 for combo) and a French toast.

They tasted EXACTLY the same from my last visit. Which was delicious! Hence I am not changing my rating and happy to say that this place is still a great place to grab a quick great tasting HK style lunch! 

Well, see you again in 2024 for my next updated review. Hopefully nothing changes, except for maybe the waitress's flossing habits :). Keke.."}
{"text":"I love this place for the Hong Kong style diner.  They have amazing sizzling plates.  My fave is the chicken steak combo which comes with soup (choice of Russian Borscht or Cream soup), dinner roll, drink (coffe, tea, etc) and dessert (usually jello or mango pudding) for only $9.50 during the lunch special.  

Note: Place gets crowded quickly and the seating isn't that comfortable as there is literally 2-3 cm between you and the table beside you.   Place is cash only as well"}
{"text":"Came to grab some lunch with my family as we were in the area. I rarely come here myself, but my brother was the one who chose, so we went along with the idea. 

We all ordered off the lunch menu, so meals were about $7.99-8.99. Order the Spaghetti Bolognese, but found it quite bland. The spaghetti itself was decent, but the meat sauce didn't have much flavour at all. Made eating it with nothing else a bit pricey at $7.99. The soup it came with was pretty good, and the break wasn't bad either. Also came with a drink, so it is a decent deal overall. 

Service seemed a bit rushed, as the servers seemed to be moving very fast, as if trying to get people to eat and leave. One server just put down the dishes on our table, without asking who was eating what. We had to rearrange the dishes ourselves. The AC was also on full blast, but worse by the windows. It was like 20+ outside, but felt like I needed a winter jacket with that amount of AC. 

Probably won't be back for a while, but a decent place for a quick, inexpensive lunch."}
{"text":"This place is located inside the Time Square plaza. This restaurant features hong Kong style food, which includes the standard rice, noodle, soup set menu, and of course, the hong long style milk tea. 

I went here for lunch. Most menus give you a set combo. In this case, it was a fixed choice of four, and each provides you with soup (either cream or tomato) and also a drink. Whenever you go to a hong Kong restaurant, always get either milk tea or lemon tea. 

I ordered a dish with black pepper stripped steak and linguine. I thought this dish would be good but unfortunately the sauce was excessive and the linguine was too soft. Not to mention, the steak wasn't even enough. Most was the linguine. 

Lastly, avoid going there at peak time. When this place gets busy (more often than not), it is a disaster. They can mess up your order and also forgot to give you the drinks. 

If you don't mind that, check it out!"}
{"text":"Not totally authentic Chinese because of Canadian style meat servings. The weekday lunches range from $9-$13, a good value in the Famous Hwy7 Times Square.
This cash only small restaurant does not have great ambience but is quite popular with the local crowd. Service is still fast and accurate. Food quality is about average and the servings are large. My ranking for the restaurant is average and on line to be good."}
{"text":"I ordered their afternoon tea menu items and thought they were a bit bland. The spaghetti bolognese had a lot of noodles but was skimpy on sauce, and the deep fried fish , while crispy had a weird fishy flavour. Maybe I need to try.the sizzling plates that everyone here is raving about. Overall for the prices, the food is decent and I think better than other hk style diners."}
{"text":"Perfect for fast and cheap Chinese food. Everything also comes in a combo too. Makes decisions so much easier. The food is good and it'd also fresh. I love coming here for lunch. 

This place is often full of kids. So def. Very kid friendly here!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised and impressed at their affordable Lunch Specials.  Considering it was after 1 p.m., the place was packed and there were lots of customers.

We ordered the Chicken in Portuguese Style with Rice and Angel Hair with Deep Fried Prawn & Sausage (Cream Sauce) from the Lunch Specials menu.  The lunch special included a soup, buns, and a drink with the dish all for just under $10.  I love Hong Kong style cafes and the wonderful deals they have. 

I got the seafood cream soup while my mom got the Russian Bortsch soup.  The seafood cream soup was just to my liking; creamy and tasty.  We got a basket of warm buns too; these were the good types of buns.  Soft!

I was pleasantly surprised with how large the dish of Angel Hair pasta was!  It was definitely creamy which I loved -- the pasta was drenched with the cream sauce.  The sausages were regular hot dogs cut up and there were two Japanese style fried prawns.  These were actually so crunchy and tasty!  I loved this dish.

The Chicken in Portuguese Style with Rice was actually so-so.  There was a small bowl of the chicken with Portuguese sauce.  In fact, there wasn't even much of the chicken inside the bowl.  I think the rice was a little hard for our taste too."}
{"text":"This is a very average HK Cafe restaurant. The Russian borch soup taste nasty. The cod fish was good. The hot lemon tea had too inch lemon and it was really bitter. I've been here few time and certain things are good."}
{"text":"Great hk style cafe. Service was super fast and efficient. Cost is great. Dont expect spectacular food, but good value."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday with the boyfriend for a quick and cheap breakfast.  For those who like Hong Kong style food, Goldsor offers some pretty authentic dishes.  Service is quite fast and food is decent; meals come your choice of coffee or tea, with the option to upgrade to a cold drink for a small fee.  Three stars only because the server who served us yesterday was quite rude; when ordering, I had to tell her, very specifically what we wanted (pretty sure she was supposed to ask us how we wanted our eggs for example), and at one point, she told me off for being confusing.  Rude!!!"}
{"text":"Hong Kong style caf√©, which is to say various rice or pasta dishes. 

Not a bad place to get a filling dinner for around $8-$9, but don't expect anything outstanding. Portions are a little larger and the ingredients a little more interesting than the usual HK style joints, which is also reflected in the pricing.

Note: cash only"}
{"text":"This place is amazing for their price, speed and service. We came in at 11:08am and they placed our order by 11:10am making the breakfast special time. Food came steaming hot within 5mins and it tastes decent too. From service standpoint the server's aren't your typical angry Chinese restaurant stereotypes. They are efficient!  One star off unfortunately because I am a HK milk tea enthusiast and I'm not fond of what they offer here. Nevertheless , still a great Hk cafe"}
{"text":"The afternoon tea menu has a pretty good selection, including satay beef vermicelli, pork cutlet & fries, fish cutlet & fries, and more filling options such as tuna tricolor fusilli, beef bolognese spaghetti, and curry rice. Price range around $5.99. 

The only thing is you can't really substitute salad for fries - you would need to order the + salad option instead, which doesn't come with a drink. 

Note: this place closes at 7pm!"}
{"text":"Goldsor is a Hong Kong style Western food cafe.  I have only tried the lunch specials here, and they are, in my opinion, exceptional deals.  The lunch specials are combos of your choice of entree, PLUS 1 bread roll with butter, 1 bowl of house soup and 1 cup of Hong Kong style tea/coffee. For example, chicken on rice lunch special is $6, spaghetti with black pepper beef strips lunch special is $7, etc..  Sizzling plates start from $9 but it also comes with dessert.  The portion is quite large, except for the chicken on rice which is the least expensive item.  However, I still won't complain as it is so cheap ($6).  

The food quality is a tricky aspect to rate.  The key to enjoy the food at Goldsor is to understand that this is (unapologetically) Hong Kong style Western food, not authentic Western food.  Some people may dislike the food because they don't taste like authentic Western food.  The food is rather saucy and it tastes overly strong (such as too peppery, or too salty, or too sweet, etc.); the spaghetti is not al dente; the meat is always cooked well done (please expect beef be tenderized by soda powder).  However, if you expect it to taste like Western food altered for a local Chinese clientele in Hong Kong, then the food at Goldsor is quite authentic (LOL, but I mean it) and enjoyable.  The favour is bold but not bad nor offensive; the food is saucy so it is perfect with plain white rice or a lot of pasta; the red meat is well done, because it is healthier (safer) than partially cooked meat.  Honestly, I personally like authentic Western food.  I do understand where this type of food come from; hence, I appreciate it for what it is.  

The service at Goldsor is fast and efficient.

In conclusion, the food at Goldsor is a good deal. You will be full and have leftover to take home.  It tastes okay, and you will like it if you expect it be a new type of food from another part of the world."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for weekday lunch as I need quick meal between my work time.  The restaurant only serve breakfast and lunch.  They close at 7pm.  They have HK style set breakfast and lunch menu.  It usually comes with bread, soup, main course and a hot drink of your choice.  The food come out quickly and it is best for someone like me who need to head back to work quickly.  The food there is decent but I cannot say they are the best.  Their soup is some what inconsistent in quality.  When they are very busy, the soup quality drop for some reason.  Luckily the food is still decent.  The price is very reasonable compare other restaurant in the same area.  The service is good but it all depend on how busy they are.  However they never forget my order."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places for cheap and yummy eats! 

Have great HK style breakfast! The satay beef is huge and delicious and the other food offerings are huge and delicious. 

The fish casserole (and all the dinner and lunch offerings) that they have are delicious and you can pay a little more to add a drink, a soup, a small jello and a roll. 

NOMNOMNOM! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Cheap and amazing lunch special deals. For around $10 you can get black pepper beef with rice which comes with your choice of cream or bortsch soup + soft warm diner roll, your choice of coffee or tea, and a jello! If you don't like black pepper beef they have other options for your main as well; and the menu items change every once in a while. Typically there are around 4-5 different mains on the list to choose from for your combo (angel hair pasta with sausage, honey sauce with chicken, curry beef brisket, etc). Big portions, and their service is quick as well. I really love this place, and recommend anyone looking for cheap eats to try it!"}
{"text":"I have not been to this place for along time and i finally decide to visit it again with friends. We are lucky to be seated right away since its always packed. Staff are always nice and friendly. Service is really fast which we needed during lunch hour break. The only downside is the noise level, people chit chatting all together.

We were given 2 menus, the regular menu and lunch special menu. I always have fried chicken steak with vegetables and added vegetables on sizzling plate. There is a choice of having rice or spaghetti but I'm not a carb person so they can just change that to more vegetables. There are 3 options for sauce, garlic gravy, gravy and black pepper sauce. I like the black pepper sauce, it has a little kick of spiciness. Each order comes with soup(either cream corn or vegetable), bread with butter, drink(milk tea or lemon tea) and dessert(jelly or pudding). All these for $11.99+tax. Deciding on these choices makes me feel excited and hungry. Order came in less than 10 minutes. Yipee! Chicken served was really hot and crispy!"}
{"text":"I love the food here but I hate the cleanliness of this restaurant. Like all Chinese restaurant, it's not sparkling clean and it gets worst if it was raining. If you can ignore the uncomfortableness of sitting at this restaurant, I'm sure you can enjoy the food here because it's not bad! The next time I come here will definitely be on a sunny day and for their afternoon tea (I believe you get a free drink with certain snacks)!"}
{"text":"We were in the area and needed a place to eat so we stopped by this restaurant and had lunch. We walked in and were greeted and seated immediately - just in time for lunch specials. We both ordered the same dish. The curry beef brisket with rice. 

The lunch menu suppose to rotate every week. The restaurant is small with at least 22 tables (didn't really count all of them lol). The number of parking spaces is too few for the number restaurants and businesses in the same plaza. 

Back to the food - the curry sauce was a tad spicy for me and pretty standard. It was flavourful and went well with the onion, potatoes and brisket. The lunch also came with a soup (tomato or cream based), bread with butter on the side, and a choice between coffee or milk tea (hot or cold). Milk tea hot or cold is pretty good. You can request to have more milk or more tea in the drink. 

I'm satisfied with the portion size of the dish and the flavours and it was definitely very filling. I had seen a few couples actually bring their own glass containers to take leftovers home. Which is a great idea for lunch the next day. 

It wasn't amazing but overall quite decent and I would come back to try other things. If you need a refill of hot tea it's easy to request for another refill because the service is pretty attentive. Food came out fairly quickly.

If you're hungry and in the area definitely make your way over here."}
{"text":"The service and food was ok.   They have breakfast special before 11 with more than 15 selections.   Breakfast special comes with a drink.   The mei fun are a bit over cooked and the sauce on the Portuguese chicken are too sweet."}
{"text":"love the variety they have at the dinner.
food pretty good. though sometimes too salty for my liking"}
{"text":"Fast paced restaurant, haven't been here for along time. Surprisingly still good food, fair size, price right. Staffs are friendly. Will come back more often"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday and it was pretty packed around noon. It's pretty loud and rowdy inside with little space between the tables. I think I actually used to come here when I was a kid and would always get a fish cutlet with fries. 
Most meals come with bread and a soup - I got the Russian borscht - pretty decent as it actually had some beef in it. 
This time I got one of the sizzling plates with a chicken steak and gravy sauce. It came with some carrots and broccoli as well. I would say the entire meal was decent but probably wouldn't get it again. Probably because the servers were a little rude and inpatient."}
{"text":"Some good deals with the set dinners. I ordered the spaghetti bolognese ($7.99) & made it a set dinner (+$3, includes soup (choice of cream or veg), mango pudding, hk style tea). 

I won't bother w/ dinner at this place again. I've had better food for the same price around the same area. I always order the spaghetti bolognese at these places but this was probably my least favourite to date. My bf ordered  seafood pasta which he thought was a bit bland. Service was alright though."}
{"text":"Shout out to this place for letting me order kiddies meal  They're known for their sizzling plates meal but other food are pretty decent too :) 

Love the hong kong style soup and bun you get at the start!"}
{"text":"Man, this places been around for over 15+ yrs. it started off as a mom and pop shop kinda Resturant with 6ish tables around the corner before time square was ever built.

This place never disappoints. It's always very yummy, super quick and service is consists to above average.

Breakfast, lunch and dinner set are very reasonable in price!

Just remember to bring a hoodie or sweater before entering. They like to have AC cranked UP.

{"text":"$10 for set lunch.  You get what you pay for.  This place is pretty packed on a Thursday lunch.  Funny to me the servers are wearing bow ties"}
{"text":"Goldsor Restaurant is located at Time Square. It serves mainly Hong Kong style Western food.

I have to say the breakfast is quite decent here, starting at $3.45. I ordered the 2 eggs/hot dogs/toast with HK style milk tea where as my sister ordered the satay beef vermicelli with hot honey lemon.

My sister really enjoy her food because it is really tasty with a lot of satay sauce. The beef is plentiful and tender. She finished the whole bowel by herself!

My breakfast set is quite ok, but for $3.45 that's really good value.

The services is fast and friendly.

I won't be hesitate to be back to eat here again."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Hong Kong westernized style restaurant.  They have a decent selection. Service is super quick."}
{"text":"I would give this place a -5 star on yelp if it was possible!!! The worse HK cafe ever!!! If I had to imagine what diarrhea tasted like it would be the baked pork chop rice I just had here.   The fried pork chop and rice was  soggy.  It's was like they fried everything and dunked it in water for a week.  It was gross. Even the meat tasted like mush.  How is that even possible!!! I didnt expect it to be cripy but musshy?? This must be the worse thing I've ever ate in my life.  It's like puking in your mouth and holding it in cause you had no place to vomit. Actually that tasted better.

And this place isn't cheap the rice and drink still cost me 20 bucks. 

Service was your typical hk cafe. Your food was horrible and you didn't eat It? That's okay you still have to pay. Fhank you very much have agood day!"}
{"text":"My family and I were out doing some boxing week shopping and decided to try this place for lunch as we were nearby. The shop was small but service was fast and friendly.

We got the lamb chops dish (16.99) with fried rice over regular rice (1.50 extra). There's also am option to make this into a set dunner for $3.50 for those that would like a bun, soup, hot beverage and dessert (jello). 

I myself opted for the peppercorn sauce with a medium rare wellness. The lamb chops itself were rather under seasoned but that may very well be catering to the Chinese community as eating healthy is a big factor for them. However, the sauce was very flavorful and the fries rice was soft and plenty. 

I will be returning with friends to try other dishes as it definitely worth its value."}
{"text":"Some of the cheapest food you'll get in the area. Good selection of normal HK style dishes. Very generous portions. It's a real shame they don't open past 7, gets very crowded for weekend lunches. Have had most of their lunch specials and they're all fine, nothing spectacular but you know what you're getting. Would recommend, maybe come a bit early or late if on the weekend."}
{"text":"They have really good breakfast options and variety! The price is affordable as well considering the potions.  Super fast and great service!"}
{"text":"Goldsor is a great choice for a quick and cheap meal if you want Hong Kong cafe style food. While the cleanliness of the restaurant may bother some, their service is as speedy as fast food restaurants and the food quality has stayed consistent over the years. Come for breakfast, lunch or dinner, it doesn't matter. You won't be disappointed with the food."}
