{"text":"Mike and the cook both deserve 5 stars. I could could on and on but Yelp would delete my post so yeah so it is what it is. Mike and the cook all 5 stars. Bless up"}
{"text":"This place was terrible. Drinks were mainly ice and still priced as if it were a decent bar. There's PTs Gold right up the street. Go there instead."}
{"text":"The best service and the most fun I have had in a bar in this town! Every bartender is great! Been to every bar close to here some have a good bartender or two but there is no full staff like this one. Clean and we'll kept I found a home. Other bars in north vegas should take a lesson from scoundrels II."}
{"text":"I usually get their burgers for delivery and they are awesome. Love, burger enthusiast"}
{"text":"Very clean bar and the lady who was bartending was on point... from the outside, the bar looks pretty run-down/sketchy. Inside, it had a nice local atmosphere. It has a nice-sized bar, 3 pool tables and a Jukebox. They serve food... I didn't have any personally, but the people I saw eating it looked like they were very satisfied. Awesome place to go to if you live nearby"}
{"text":"Great burger, cheap beer. Big bar, pool tables, plenty of room. Something like this is great to put into your regular bar rotation."}
{"text":"Great service in a friendly establishment. At many other local bars, patrons have to track down a server just for a drink. Running low on beverages and/or food doesn't happen here.  I'll keep returning."}
{"text":"I always have a great time here. I go in the late night/early morning shift and Missy has always been good to me. Found out that they have a burger challenge there and found a video of these guys call Big P'ee and Remar taking it on. I'll kindly post the link here below:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abvo9q8RLhg  Besides the staff being wonderful, the food here is pretty good. I had one of their signature Phillies and their beer selection is modest, so far always in a cold glass. :) The video gives a great description of what it's like there, the music, the people. I recommend giving it a watch."}
{"text":"Somewhere to just go, head out the house with my cousins after work days to just grab a few brews and shoot pool/darts."}
{"text":"Free pool and darts! Mike the bartender makes beautiful drinks and was very attentive and friendly!"}
{"text":"Wow what a great hamburger wasn't expecting a burger taste that great but outstanding the bartender she was great to the service I was very very very satisfied"}
{"text":"This place was great at one point. Now it's all about being Colleen's BFF or you will be ignored. Slots have gotten really stingy and if anyone around wins the machines turn around and rob everyone else not one pair after loosing $40 because someone else hit their. I believe resetting your machines after a win is illegal and they freeze in between hands. Colleen does a great job in making you feels like shit after loosing big money in 10 minutes. I thought we were friends after so many years but I guess the name of the game is get the players out before they Can even finish a drink or even order food. Very smart scoundrels tighten up your machines so your Food and Beverage can suffer. I been coming here forever and it gets worse every visit. I don't feel any love anymore after all I did recommended everyone to this place when it was empty and to feel unwanted and ignored is a bit harsh. Oh yeah bring you fake face on and lots of tip money to get bartenders attention. That's what gaming has become in Las Vegas playing favorites kissing up to bartenders and hoping they will treat you right. They need to change their ways either way I wish them luck and hope one day I can turn this rating around"}
{"text":"This recommendation goes out to a bartender named Colleen. You will be happy and entertained by this lady! And don't worry about some loud mouth ruining your night. Because Colleen will remove them and you can enjoy her witty, youthful conversation! Food is fantastic, especially when Chef Douglas is working! Come out and have some fun!    As always the place is really fun! But I want to also give a shout out to Jason for making our \"to go\" food exactly like we ordered it! It was delicious! Thank you for listening to what Colleen ( the best bartender tonight) ordered, and making it like we requested! I say Colleen is the best tonight only because, if you've seen her and Missy working together, well you know it's best night ever         Stopped in and Chef Juan made a great chopped salad! Also , he has a great sense of humor, he's kinda cheeky, but truely a sweet guy . He is a one in a million!2/16/2018 Juan the chef made a delicious meal! And he is a funny and entertaining character! I recommend ordering anything off the menu. He is a fantastic cook and a great guy. And Missy and Colleen are the best as well!"}
{"text":"Yo, this place is legit! A couple of friends invited me here, they couldn't believe I could do the Scoundrel Burger Challenge. I smashed it. Got a free shirt. Great food. But the life of the party is Mike the bartender. Dude is funny as hell, has great customer service, and he gave me and my friends some pretty unique shots. Great place to be at!"}
{"text":"This is a terrible place to be, goto North Star right up the street, I do not live in LV full time and they didn't want me to be a part of their local players club since I do not have a Nevada DL. Well, I won't be a part of anything here with the rude staff."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Many a great nite at old Scoundrels! Cheese steaks are the bomb! Fun atmosphere and great gaming. 3 pool tables and 3 dart boards. As well at golden tee and big buck hunter! Lots of fun, food and drinks to be had at this little north side gem!"}
{"text":"Great local place with Michigan Barmaids (Bar-wench) is more fitting. That's being pleasant."}
{"text":"The bar manager Matt is an absolute jerk!  Drinks are average they do have a couple of the good bar tenders but all in all I'd keep my girlfriend out of the dump!"}
{"text":"Graveyard \"bartender\" Mike has a \"it's all about me\" thing going on. How has this ass clown still have a job here? The answer:  Incompetent ownership/management"}
{"text":"The lady on duty around 11p Saturday night 10/21 was friendly and awesome. The guy after her Mike was a real douche bag and when I ask for the name of his manager he said \" I am the manager\" then when I asked for the name of the owner he said \"don't worry I'll take care of you.\" The mere fact that he refused to give me the name of his superior is acknowledging on his behalf that he was being a dick. I get now why my friends prefer the Lone star down the road. One bad bartender trumps the cool ones. The one star is for the lady before his shift. She should upgrade her employment to a better bar."}
{"text":"I come here mainly for the eye candy that is Josh and the lack of Luke Bryan songs playing on the juke box. They have great chicken fingers and chicken wings.  I work nights and I like hanging out here. Nobody bothers me and the Fireball flows freely. I always see the same guy in the orange shirt that wants to buy me shots. This is the Cheers of North Las Vegas.  Between Glen, Josh and Colleen you could build an arsenal, bug out bag, nutrition plan, work out and figure out most legal situations. If you want conversation and a decent bar, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Don't order the food. I ordered the chicken nachos. I have had more cheese on a salad!"}
{"text":"Update: Ladies and Gentlemen, Scoundrels II has unveiled their new menu. As I cast my gaze upon the new literature with all of the new options and choices, one item in particular really caught my naked eye. Allow me to walk you through the instant classic, the world renowned, Tuna Melt, Heather's Style.   As starving as I was I was surprised by how quickly Heather's Tuna came following the uttering of my order that spewed from my lips. Lightly kissed by a passionate fire, Heathers Tuna is nestled between two soft, buttered white buns. The Eye or Sauron could not have looked any harder at this beautiful crafted creation.   Most consumers are forced to only a single Melt option on menus where culinary experts jam a hunk of beef between those poor buns but not this imagination of tasty materials all loaded in Heather's Tuna. The meat absolutely explodes in your mouth and the melted cheese oozes and drips slowly ensuring that none of it goes to waste.   The only con I can think of is that the pleasure of Heather's Tuna is over almost as fast as it arrives. I sit here now with my cleared plate in view saddened by the fact that this experience has come to a close. I am sure that Heather's Tuna will remain on my mind until I visit this establishment where I can place the same order again ...tomorrow."}
{"text":"I Love these guys.    I usually don't get to hang out here too many times but everytime I do they are very friendly and attentive.   Colleen and Mel are my favs!     It seems like the bad reviews they have are all from people that only do negative reviews and those kind of people suck and will never be happy!   Good Job Scoundrels on weeding out the negative people so the rest of us can have fun there!  LOL"}
{"text":"Came here to eat Wendy is terrible server food is decent . Took her forever to refill my drink had to ask 4 times waited 10 minutes every time I asked her for a refill will never come back on shift"}
{"text":"Home of the worlds best bartender! And the jaeger is always cold! Nuff said"}
{"text":"WOW our first time here and no bowl game  specials. kitchen help comes out and blows cigarette smoke all over us while we are in the corner away from everyone else.  Happy hour is a whole .75 cent savings on a beer.  woohoo.  no going to be back here again."}
{"text":"This bar is an absolute amazing place to be! The bar staff is wonderful. I feel at home here! My favorite place to be in Las Vegas. The food and drinks are great! Scoundrels Pub II is the place to be!!!"}
