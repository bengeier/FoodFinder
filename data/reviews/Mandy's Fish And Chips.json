{"text":"The Restaurant is a jewel for fish lovers, I have enjoyed the shrimp, catfish, calamari and there desserts.The prices invites return visits. They provide dine in or carry out. With excellent customer service. 
I recommend Mandy's  to all ,especially those in the south mountain region. Who have been looking for a great fried fish place.  And had no idea one was here. Try it you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Had no idea this place existed! Got the Mandy's 20 pc special with a few sides for our family. Fabulous. What a change from all the same old same old not so good stuff here in Laveen. Service was wonderful. Food was great in proportions. Totally worth it. Menu - amazing selection. Even for those who may not be fans of fish etc. A bit of something for everyone. Can not say enough about how happy I am this place is close to us in Laveen. Needs sign out front so others can see it is here! Beats the same crappy popeyes / Mcdonalds/ Bad chinese / places here who seem to not be able to get orders correct ( every damn time ). Least here we got our money's worth and was not cheated. Most definitely returning!"}
{"text":"Had a 2 piece fish and chips (catfish) and zucchini. So much food couldn't finish it all. Great tasting catfish though. Glad I finally tried this place, I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best place for some good fish or anything you have a taste for in Laveen! Hush puppies are delicious n so is the Philly cheese steak sandwich."}
{"text":"Lived in the Laveen over the past year and we are just discovering this place.  I wish I would have sooner.  Best fish we have had in Arizona so far and we have tried a lot.  The two different battered cod are so delicious, full of flavor and the fish is so clean and white.  The hush puppies are great and the fries were nice and crisp.  We will definitely be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Was looking forward to trying Mandy's for fish and chips, especially seeing the greats reviews.  However I called to place an order an hour before closing time, but they informed me they had already closed the grill.  They did allow me to order from the fryer which I did.  10 minutes later they called to let me know they do not have enough fries to complete my order.  Shouldn't they have known that before they took my order?  I don't know if it's just a bunch of kids working at closing but it was very unprofessional and not good business practice to not know own inventory or close grill so early.  Unfortunately I was unable to review the food and they lost a customer."}
{"text":"We order from here twice a month. I love the gyros. Good food for a good price. Very quick on service."}
{"text":"Best place in town! Food is to die for and customer service is awesome. Ohh and the boy at the cash register with the man bun is cute!"}
{"text":"Everyone's very informative and patient If you've visited a few times but still don't know how the menu. No worries. Family owned and affordable."}
{"text":"Wasn't sure what to expect and was treated to delicious catfish and shrimp. Was so good I went back to back days."}
{"text":"We tried a bunch of their food in the past the fish and the crab balls and all sorts of stuff and weren't too thrilled. We were told they had amazing wings so we decided to try them out. I ordered 36 wings I got there to pick them up and they only gave me an order of 24, but said it comes with a side of fries so it's okay. NO NOT OKAY I asked for 36 wings. On top of that they charge me a much higher price than what was on the Internet. You do not advertise one price and charge another. That's bait and switch and that's not how business works. That's wrong, a good business honors the price, apologizes and fixes the problem by updating their web page. This was not some old coupon I was hanging onto. This was their web page at that second. She tells me oh yeah we got to get that fixed we haven't uploaded our new menus and she would not honor the price.  The wings were good however. They only buffalo flavor they had was med heat at best. They tested about like long wings as a comparison. Bbq Sauce was good a sweet."}
{"text":"First time eating here and the food was ok. I had the 3 piece fish and shrimp combo and the I have to say the breading was a bit bland, it could use more flavor but that's just my taste. The cheesecake was good though! I'll try it out again and maybe get something different."}
{"text":"I'm from Detroit where fish is King you fried bake acrylic bralette you name it this place is on point founded in like a last-minute option went in and I'm telling you you have to try this place out don't sleep on it in the shopping mall right there with a Home Depot and cross the street from Lifetime Fitness fish specials almost every day and the food they give you more than enough for what you're paying for it is fish no don't go there come to Mandy's this is the place to be you get more than what you pay for.

They are very convenient easy to find you can also order online or by phone get there try it and they have Kool-Aid what other place outside Lolo do you know that has Kool-Aid that can go along with your Mill this place is on point."}
{"text":"I stopped going to the location on 51st Ave. for my bad experience with their wings. So, today I gave it another try with the catfish. Another bad experience. My fish was hard and over cooked and my fry's were burnt. I took my food back and got my money back. Never again will order food from this place."}
{"text":"Just ordered a chicken tender combo. More like the $1.00 mechanically separated chicken patty from McDonald's. Thank God the fries were at least good. I asked for the tenders to be tossed in buffalo sauce. They said they could. When I received my meal they didn't. I asked if they could toss them again and I was told there was 3 sides of sauce in the bag. ( There's a little bit of a language barrier here.)
I said ok thinking I'll do it myself. I drive back to my office and find its bbq sauce not buffalo. No big deal I'll live. Open up the ranch containers they gave me and the ranch was bad. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"When I walked in here it smelled so good! Smelled like I was making fish right at home. It's a cute little place. They have a tv for the sitting area. I haven't tried it but definitely want to come back to try their fish. They also reliever thru UberEats."}
{"text":"Wow! Wish I knew about this place sooner. Not only was the service and food A+. This place is spic and span clean.  The fish is fresh and the service was the best! She explained the menu and cared.
Highly recommended, 
From a true foodie"}
{"text":"Mandy's makes the best (Beef) Philly  Cheese Steak in south Phoenix!!!
The Chicken Philly Cheese Steak is pretty scrumptious as wel
My favorite go to place for Philly Cheese Steaks.
Thanks to Uber Eats, I found this place too.

************UPDATE************
As you all know, when you find YOUR favorite restaurant you usually order from them often.
One of the last two times I placed an order (UBER)
I was charged and didn't receive the product.
Since new to UBER yet, didn't know protocol of calling UBER. My instinct was to call the restaurant.
I spoke to a gentleman whom was (owner or Manager) very helpful and called UBER for me and made it right. 

Another +++ from me; as to why I Love Mandy's!!

Thanks for going the extra mile!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for the first time. Catfish was excellent. Food was served hot and fresh. Staff was very nice and the service was quick. We will be stopping by next time we are in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This place was ok. Order was done fast. Fries not fresh and not much flavor to the food. Mostly bread and less fish. Staff was friendly though. I won't be giving it a try anytime soon."}
{"text":"The food at this restaurant was delicious and the staff was friendly. I got the  fried cat fish and shrimp. It came hush puppies and fries for $9.99. I was very impressed with this place I think I found a new favorite place to eat."}
{"text":"Went in and no one  was at the front. I waited almost five minutes and someone peeked out from out back. I ordered a Cheesesteak and she rang it up. I gave her my card and looked down and a roach was crawling at the base of the register. I told the cashier and she looked at it and called the person in the back. She came out looked at the roach and went back to what she was doing. Neither one of them even attempted to get it. I went and sat to wait for my food and I see a second one. My food comes out and it was a good cheesesteak. I'm not sure Ill be returning anytime soon, it was kinda gross to be in there and then for them to not care was bothersome."}
{"text":"Recently moved back home to the desert from a 10 year stint in the SF Bay Area and was craving fish.  It's hard to find CA coastal type fish and chip joints out here in the desert.  Mandy's is dead on comparable to what I was used to over there.  Everything is good on the menu.  I will definitely be a regular at Mandy's."}
{"text":"good food and cheap pricing. I've only gotten them with uber eats but the food and ice cream is so good I would drive anywhere to get it myself"}
{"text":"The food is really good, they're establishment is really clean but wait times are a little higher than expected and it's warm in here which is off putting for a seafood place. They need more staff. Overall great service, though. I really enjoy eating here."}
{"text":"Who doesn't like Fish & Chips?! 
Mandy's Fish & Chips did not disappoint and it really brought a nostalgia moment for me. This is a small business with a small kitchen with big variety of combos and fish. 
I got the Mandy's Special 3 fish, shrimp and fries. No drink included. I eventually added the drink, chose the catfish as my fish. They offer cod, bass, whitening, catfish. 
I also got a side of whiting fish and bass which to my surprise came with a HUGE thing of fries. How cool! 
The combo meal was good to me. The catfish was good but it didn't have a identity to it's taste. So it basically taste like everyone's fast food catfish. Regular batter was used in this catfish. The shrimp were nice size shrimp, I was expecting little popcorn shrimp. The batter to the shrimp though was not memorable but it did the job. 
As mentioned earlier I did order the whitening fish and I would like to recommend you try whitening fish as it's my favorite new personal. I've had it previously, and this whiting fish was TASTY. This particular fish needs no special batter as it's natural taste explodes on your taste buds. The texture is moist soft and different. The bass on the other hand is a tougher fish, trying it here I wouldn't break my neck for but it wouldn't hurt your experience just don't order more than one. 
The fries at Mandy's Fish and Chip's is a favorite of mine, fresh as always. The texture of the fries are my favorite, crunchy and airy like feeling when you bite. The provided drinks were my FAVORITE part of coming here. They had koolaid slushies of 4 flavors. Life was good at that moment. 
I would finally like to point out the prices. The prices of this restaurant are right up my alley. Here are my favorite type of prices offering my favorite type of meal combos. Even for fish spot they offer a very great prices that make you want to come back and eat repeatedly. To finalize this review I will like to let you know the reader, that you should absolutely come to Mandy's Fish and Chips!"}
{"text":"I came here just to try something new in the area. So glad I did, I ordered the two piece bass, great flavor. Customer service was nice, I will definitely be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Our first time here, a lot smaller inside than I had thought. Cashier was friendly place was clean. We ordered two Mandy's special one was catfish the other cod with shrimp. The catfish in cornmeal was perfectly cooked, the cod we had with batter also was perfectly cooked. The tarter sauce flavorful the other sauce I'm guessing is a mixture of EL Pato sauce and maybe ketchup? Idk but it was good. Fries were crispy, and nothing we had was greasy which is such a plus because that can really ruin a meal. I see they have Philly cheese steaks which are my fave so I am going to have to come back to try it out. Portions and prices were good. Definitely will come back and I'm glad I tried it out because our go to spot has definitely declined over the years so I am glad we found this."}
{"text":"I really like this place. I usually only order the Mandy's special with the catfish and have never been disappointed with it. I ordered something different this time, the philly cheese steak combo. I don't have many great cheese steak sandwiches in my history to compare this one to, so I don't know if this was a bad sandwich or I just don't like cheese steak. It was very greasy, like soaked through the bread greasy. I was only able to eat about half of it before I gave up. I like this place enough that I'd still recommend it. I most likely not be doing any more experimenting with the menu options though, I'll stick with the catfish from now on."}
{"text":"Service was fast and friendly. Order was out quickly, fresh and hot. Shrimp and fish were cooked well. Have to agree with a few other posters, breading on the shrimp was a bit heavy and breading on the catfish was dull, very bland. Season that breading up a bit and the review would be a 5 star."}
{"text":"Food is bomb but service sucks. They always close half the kitchen down 30 mins before they close and they already close early. If you order take out 30 mins before they close, they have an attitude about it. Haven't eaten here in a while and this reminded me why. The food is really good but I work late so it's hard to get there before 7pm. I'm also from Detroit so it reminds me of a coney, but without the 24 hour service."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time yesterday and it was mediocre. The service was great however the food itself needs to step it up a notch. The breading for the fish was very bland. I ordered the catfish sandwich and it was literally just catfish pieces in between a bun, no sauces on it, nothing. It would be a good place to eat if they just up'd the breading for the fish. Needs more spices!!!"}
{"text":"Garbage. Ordered and picked up cold, greasy food. I knew I shouldn't have even bothered to pickup my food from the phone order I put in with the rudest girl who answered the phone. I was hung up on without a thank you, goodbye, and had to ask their exact location for pickup since it was my first time ordering. I've had better fish and chips from Pete's and even JJs. I wouldn't ever spend another $ here, just disappointed since this place is so close to the house. Too bad, hope they make improvements."}
{"text":"Ok, my second time here and I decided to try the fish(catfish). My oh my!! Amazing!! I visited at the peak of lunch time so my food came out fresh! Hot and full of flavor. The front desk girl was nice. The dining area was clean and so was the restroom. I'll be back! (In my Arnold Schwarzenegger voice)"}
{"text":"UPDATE

Much respect to the Mandy family. 

Appreciate the candid conversation.  

As I said good hot food!

I'll definitely eat here often. 

My co workers and I will be here for lunch next week. 

Thanks again!

Peace and Love

{"text":"Yum yum yum. I am so glad we found this place!  The food is fantastic. Not greasy, very fresh, and a lot of variety. The kids love it, too!  For a little while in the wall spot, this place is amazing, and the service was fast and friendly. I highly recommend this spot."}
{"text":"While this place is much better than Pete's Fish and Chips, I hate to say the service really sucked for my first time here. What I wanted, a whiting fish sandwich combo, I didn't get. When it came to my table I got some fish and shrimp. And while they did get the fried mushroom part of my order right, for the price you pay for them the portion was really small. I took my order back up to the counter and it was not the easiest thing to get the attention of the girls in the kitchen. I said this wasn't what I ordered and was told they were out of sandwich buns for fish sandwiches. I said it would have been nice to be told this in the beginning instead of receiving something I didn't want, to which she said she heard me wrong, she thought I said a whiting fish combo. Then she offered me a Philly bun for a sandwich. She brought me just that, a warm bun that was sliced so I could assemble a sandwich with what I was given. I took all of my order back again and I'm thankful that she didn't argue with me in giving me a refund. Maybe in a few months I'll give it another try but in the meantime I'll stay with anything else but this place."}
{"text":"The food is good I've eaten here a couple of times fish shrimp and chips the only thing I missed is the malt vinegar. When I need my fix I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place came highly recommended for good fish. Having experienced illness from dirty restaurants, I don't care how good it taste I pass. I couldn't see in the kitchen, but first impressions count"}
