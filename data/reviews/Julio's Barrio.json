{"text":"Ordered the Mexican salad this past Saturday and was unsatisfied with the taste of unwashed lettuce. Upon confronting the waitress about this she apologize which I was thankful for. Offering to make me another which I refused due to that being a waste of food. The manager then approached me saying this was a normal complaint from people in the restaurant. Blaming it on the meat making it taste like dirt. I proceed to tell her I had the same meat on the nachos and they tasted fine. The woman clearly had no culinary experience telling me how the same meat tasted more dirt like in my salad. I having personal culinary experience in schooling and job atmospheres laughed to myself and politely just asked for the bill. On top of all this my friend had ordered a dish with the same lettuce which also tasted quite nasty. If your looking for fresh this is not the place to be. Your getting fast food quality for steakhouse prices."}
{"text":"Worst mexican food EVER!  ... that said they do have great bulldogs. Really my advice would be go there for drinks after you eat!"}
{"text":"This place is just a rip off!! The worst service that I have ever experienced at any restaurants, even the fast food restaurants would serve better than this place.  The servers are all cranky with absolute no smile on their faces.  I went to this restaurant with a friend, first we had to wait for at least 15 mins for anyone to actually come and talk to us, our server did not even talk to us, every time we asked her for something, she just replied with a head shake and walked away.  I requested her that I do not eat pork, all the meat that she and the other server would bring was PORK!! ahhh if you guys would like to save your $55.00 please do not go to this place, it is just not worth your money or time.
very very disappointed at Julio's Barrio!"}
{"text":"I recently moved back to Calgary from San Diego and I'm so bummed by the lack of good mexican in this city.  My veggie chili was tasty but overpriced and not authentic in the least.  Ditto to my husband's and in-law's dishes.  For $18 you'd expect a lot more than you get.  It wasn't horrible, but I won't be returning."}
{"text":"I seriously do not crave Mexican Food but this may be the best hangover food out there. Salty margs and greasy nachos seriously is an awesome cure.  I have no comment on the atmosphere, the service, I just know this cures the 24 hour flu."}
{"text":"Sitting on the patio is fun.  But that's about all, I've eaten there three times now, and always have hoped it would get better, but it hasn't.  Service is never great, you are usually packed tighter than sardines, and the food isn't great, at all.

It's not the worst place I've eaten, but I wouldn't recommend it, and won't go back there again based on my choice."}
{"text":"This place just sucks.  The service is slow, the decor is lame faux Mexican, and the food is terrible.  Actually the free chips and salsa were okay, probably because they're bought in."}
{"text":"Overall great food and pricing.  Service was much better than most places even though it was busy.
Deck has a great view and loved the bulldogs !"}
{"text":"I had just recently booked a reservation for my birthday and had made sure to call a couple of hours in advance to confirm. All was well, until I was running a little late. One of the staff members had given me a call to see if I was still coming; I had made sure to sincerely apologize for my lack of punctuality but assured her that I would still be arriving for my reservation. 
     Upon delays in traffic, I had finally arrived 30 minutes late (with the fault of my own, of course) but even after two confirmation calls, they had still given my table away. The lady, I'm assuming the GM very rudely explained to me that since I was late, my table was given away (although I had assured I was still to arrive)... She had shown absolutely no understanding to my situation which left me to be a little distraught in the beginning. I had called to reserve the table two weeks in advance.
     Although it was a very rude welcoming, we were eventually given a table. To my surprise, our server was very sweet and attentive, and I felt like we were all being taken care of. The drinks were great and the food was great, and I was also given a complementary tequila shot for my birthday. The overall atmosphere was very laid back and fun. 
     I wish I could have given a higher rating, but I had felt very unwelcome for the first few minutes of arriving. I may return, but will probably never book a large party there again, due to the lack of customer service and overall etiquette when dealing with patrons who are a little late."}
{"text":"We used to go there when we lived closer, but now that we are in Airdrie it's a longer trip and my expectations for this place have been dipping for at least a year.  They have been under new management since January and it shows.  5 minutes to get seated on a Wednesday at 4pm, 10 minutes after that to get service of any kind, 20 minutes to order drinks...waited 10 more minutes for those.  Food was 45 minutes and was cold.  We told our waitress and she said she would talke to the Manager who did nothing to comp us or even come over to apologize.  Won't ever be going back!  Oh and the sangria I had had 3 wilted blueberries in it and that's it.  Definately not what it used to be.  Also a lot of really really drunk people being over served."}
{"text":"Aye Caramba! I hadn't been to Julio's in eons and now I remember why.  Part of me wonders why the heck this place is still open but then I look around at the clientele and it all makes sense.  

I love my friends but I don't love their taste in casual restaurants, particularly when they dragged me to Julio's during my visit back home.  When the three of us arrived, it took about 10 minutes for one of the counted 6 servers and 2 bartenders on staff to come up and ask if we wanted to be seated.  If there was a hostess on staff, she should be canned asap.

I've never been a fan of pseudo-touristy-Mexican restaurants with cheesy decor because I just know the food is going to be as cliche as humanly possible and of course, it was.  I ordered portabello mushroom fajitas which were okay, but certainly nothing like what I've had in Mexico or any decent Mexican establishment.

What really chapped my arse was the service.  Not only was it near dead in the restaurant the night we went in, but there were at least 15 staff on minus the kitchen and we still had slow, sporadic service with a new server every time.  From where we were sitting we could see the servers and bartenders mingling around the bar, chatting with friends and generally ignoring the fact that they were being paid to do very little.  I can't imagine what a tip-out on a night like this must be, but it sure wouldn't be worth it.  When I see that many useless staff on the floor, I can only imagine who manages this joint and how much moolah they must be losing.

Regardless, I honestly hope they shut this place for good and open up something spectacular here because the location is gold.  Or at least, change the name...!"}
{"text":"Absolutely awful. Food is terrible. Service is atrocious. Enough said."}
{"text":"It's fairly good but very very noisy. .better for youngish crowd. . Have had better mex in yyc"}
{"text":"Not good, not horrible. You can't get authentic Mexican in Calgary, or I'm guessing most of Canada. Julio's Barrio is overpriced though, and be prepared for deep-fried everything. However, you can always wash this down with a huge Margarita"}
{"text":"If this was a community-oriented business I may have given them another star. Yet it does not seem to be. On top of that, the prices on the menu indicate the cost of the lease, and not the quality of what you are served. 
     The strange fortune for Julio's Barrio is that they somehow maintained the primary demographic which used to be a 'lock' for Red Robin (IE 18-20something, television-oriented, going to the place as an excuse to have fun with friends instead of choosing Julio's because of the quality). That said, Julio's pulls off the bait and switch in spades -- this place looks as though you may have the best time of your life here (see: Pied Pickle commercials from the 1980's). If you get hammered quickly, the night may (later) seem to have been fun. But then you remember how much you spent, and what you got in exchange...
     The burrito was huge, and cold. The accompanying salsa was straight-outta-jar (really?) as was the guacamole. The beans were precooked (perhaps prepackaged as 're-fried'?) and the 'greens' were industry standard 'shred'. Sigh.
     I really empathized with the staff, as they did their jobs well, yet one could tell that they knew exactly what they were a part of, and as such did not give anymore energy to the job as was required.
     So: no mitigating factors at Julio's Barrio -- unless you are wealthy. Then get 15 friends to meet you there, and use the space as for a debauched party. The management group will enable your behaviour, as long as you pay for it."}
{"text":"We made online reservations for a birthday (Aug 4th), and then checked out the ratings....well you can read for yourself, the ratings have not been great.   

Thinking the evening would be a disaster, we cancelled by email, and told them truthfully, it was because of the bad online reviews.  We were quite surprised to get a phone call from the manager, Shane, telling us about the changes that had been made in the last year, and do give them a try.  

So we did.

The service was great: prompt, attentive she had a great sense of humour.  Shane came by to check on us a few times.  The food was hot, good sized portions and really good!  We were a party of 10 and everyone had something different.  Not a single complaint.  I was so full, I barely got through half of my fajita....it will make a fine next day meal  ;-)

We had an awesome night!  If nothing else, I would go back for the bulldogs and the atmosphere.  We will definitely be repeat customer."}
{"text":"Where's the spice? 

I've always heard great things about Julio's Barrio from word of mouth so I decided why not and give it a try. For those who doesn't know what Julio's Barrio is don't worry you're not missing out. The location is great, along Memorial Drive NW and Kensington, and the atmosphere is okay. You'll have the option of choosing patio, lounge or dinning and depending on the weather you are going it's best to go to the patio, why you may ask? The roof top patio overlooks the Bow River which has got to be the most beautiful scenery ever.

Here at Julio's they start you off with complementary nachos with a side of salsa and to be honest their salsa is better than any store bought salsa. Although the downside was that the salsa wasn't enough for the amount of chips that was included so best to order an extra side of sauce - it's free too so you don't have to worry! I ordered the steak version of the quesadillas and my girlfriend ordered the pollo en chipotle. One thing I noticed for both dish was it was lacking the spice. There wasn't any Mexican flare that stood out and to me it looks like some ordinary dish. When my girlfriend ordered the pollo en chipotle they messed up on her order really bad, I wasn't too sure if it was the server didn't write it down or just had bad memory but the customs made to that dish was no Julio's salad, no corn salad, sub fries, and keep everything else. When she got it the dish was basically two pieces of sauced chicken breast and one handful of fries. When she confronted the server and asked if it came with the rice and beans the server said something along the lines of \"oh I thought you didn't want that too\" even though the order was repeated twice. So of course the server made a mistake and ask if we would want it on the side which we agreed to, a couple of minutes later there were two medium sized bowls: one filled with rice and and the other filled with beans with two tortilla chips on the top. 

I must say my overall experience would be a \"meh\" would I recommend Julio's? Sure if you want something quick to eat but for a Mexican place I would suggest elsewhere unless Julio's started adding more Mexican flare to their dish."}
{"text":"Large fishbowl glass filled with lime slush, 2 shots of tequila, and a coronita (small corona) tipped into it. What could you not love? Beer-garitas are delicious and tasty. The Classic Bulldog is the only one I tried, next on my list is the dog-tor-pepper. DELICIOUS!!!

I only had drinks no food, the service was great and friendly! Can't wait to go back for more Bulldogs!"}
{"text":"So ... first thing the waiter maybe he was new? Not sure but he had major attitude. I ordered the quesadilla... which usually comes round and melted cheese keeping the two tortillas together.. apparently here they do 1 tortilla in half, the top was mush and the chicken looked like cat food. The waiter asked if I wanted to look at the menu for something else, at that point I lost my appetite and decided not to order anything else. The waiter basically does a \"hair flip\" and says \"k\" and walks away. 

At least the manager not sure... Came by and wrote off the table but never again. 

The guacamole was tasty ...  but that's about it."}
{"text":"The service was decently good, the food came pretty quick but for the price you pay, it really isn't that good, me and a few friends ordered the steak tacos and you barely get any meat and the steak is basically ground beef for about 18 bucks each dish it isn't really worth when there was more vegetables on the taco which kinda sucks. 
Food was plain, not as tasty as it looks, dried rice, beans were meh, etc. It isn't really as authentic that I thought it would be. 
Taco time and taco bell would be more pleasant and cheaper."}
{"text":"Took my 14 year old daughter who declared this the worst restaurant food she's ever had. While I disagree to that level it isn't likely a place I'd return to to eat. Portions are huge, and the complimentary chips and salsa are welcome but they would be better off paring portion sizes, checking quality and decreasing their ridiculously high prices for a very low food cost product. We had a groupon so $45 to spend on lunch. Shared the apps platter which came with a variety of appetizers from the menu which all tasted about the same, all deep fried. We then shared the soft beef tacos. A bowl of mushy bland taco meat topped with grated cheese, some chopped lettuce and tomato and four small white soft tacos folded on the plate. This went virtually uneaten. Service was pleasant and offered to bring a taste of all of the salsas (at no charge) which was nice, although the portions were way too big for the two of us which was a huge waste. They will validate your parking in the adjoining lot but you need to bring your parking receipt with you which of course leaves you vulnerable to getting a ticket."}
{"text":"I have been here a handful of times and I can say that my experience has been consistent, if nothing else. I find this place loud and the food is OK, but nothing to write home about.

We have also had to wait a long time to be seated, even when there are plenty of tables open.

I find the food to be a bit greasy and while it's more authentic than Taco Bell, the taste isn't much better. It is a bit overpriced, too.

I drive by this place often, but when it comes to making a choice about where to eat in Kensington, personally, I think there are better options."}
{"text":"Im not a huge fan of mexican and this was exactly what it was. And not americanized mexican either. SO I was a bit disappointed with the food options. I tried the chicken quasadilla. It was good, but too much onions and peppers in it. 

What I did like was their drinks! Can anyone say FISH BOWLS?!?!?! Pay $12 to get a HUGE drink with 3 shots of booze in it, sounds like a good deal to me. And they had lots of falvours and they had the option of choosing different types of booze in your drink, which I liked.

I would go their again, but just for drinks, I'd eat before hand."}
{"text":"I used to live in Texas, capital of Tex-Mex, for a while and was curious to try out the food at Julio's Barrio. I would not recommend this place to anyone unless Julio's Barrio made some serious changes to the quality of the food.

We ordered the Enchiladas and Barrio Chili. The enchilada itself looked like it had been made from pre-made and processed products from Coop. The refried beans were clearly out of a can and still had a dry appearance. The corn was not grilled, but instead, were frozen and simply tossed into a pan to reheat. If I'm paying this much for a meal, it better have fresh ingredients made by someone experienced with Mexican food.

Their website says \"It's as if we made a little piece of Mexico right here, just for you.\" I think any Mexican would hurl at the very notion. Do yourself a favor and go to Taco Time. At least you'll have some extra cash in your pocket."}
{"text":"Went there Friday about 5:30 pm.  Should have consulted Yelp reviews before choosing this restaurant.  I have lived in Mexico long term and also 20 years in east Los Angeles.  The food here is nothing like Mexican in flavour.  We had some shrimp as an appetizer that was deep fried, dried, and salty.  All 4 of us got the Julio Platter, including an enchilada and beef quesadilla.  Generous portion of beef in the quesadilla, but very high in salt and lacking in other flavour.  The enchilada salsa had a strange flavour to it.  It looked like mole, but was nothing close to that.  Even the salsa they brought for the tortilla chips had a bad flavour.  The entire meal was so salty that I think my blood pressure went up several notches.  No matter .. they say salt preserves ya.  I'm sure they put in lots of salt so you will buy lots of beer--very unhealthy.  My biggest concern is the poor flavour of the food.  All 4 of us commented on how bad the Julio Platter was. Poorly spiced, and nothing like Mexican.  I am sure the cook cannot be Mexican.  I think maybe hired off  Cash Corner.  I was later actually scolded by my friends for suggesting we go there.  The location and the venue are beautiful.  Very nice.  Nice waitress. But I would not recommend eating there . . . especially at those prices."}
{"text":"We went here on Saturday. We were seated quickly, the service was excellent and the food tasted good. What more can I say. this was our first visit and certainly not our last."}
{"text":"This place is the worst Mexican restaurant I have ever been to. The service was mediocre, the food bland and expensive and there were little bugs crawling around the salt and pepper at our table. 
I just don't understand how this place is popular! The salsas taste like a marinara sauce instead of fresh and interesting. 
Don't even get me started on the tortilla chips they served! They came from a bag and are worse quality than tostitos chips that you buy at your local grocer. 
Not only that, my boyfriend and I now have a terrible case of mudbutt from the \"mexican\" food they served us. Taco Bell would have been a better option."}
{"text":"A few weeks ago, it was my friend's birthday, so a group of us decided to do dinner and drinks. Now, we know the food here isn't great, so we ate dinner elsewhere before coming here. We got a nice window seat, so we could people watch. But the chairs were ridiculously uncomfortable. Also the tables were so close together, my chair was pretty much right against the chair of the person at the next table. I know they're trying to get as many people in as possible, but at least space out the tables a bit more. 
Our server was awful. I can't remember her name, but she certainly went out of her way to make us feel unwelcome. We came for some bulldogs, which were yummy as usual. But, the server was like a succubus everytime she walked over to our table. Never smiling, slamming our drinks down on the table and not caring about how we were doing. I use the term succubus because whenever she was around, she sucked the birthday party spirit out of us. The real kicker was when we paid. Now, I usually tip at least 20-25% if not more, as I work in the industry and get that things can get rough sometimes. But, there was no excuse for her bad attitude as they weren't that busy. So, my friends and I left her a 10% tip, which she counted in front of us and then gave us a dirty look before disappearing again. Sorry sweetheart, if you want good tips maybe you should be attentive and at least pretend like you give a damn! The birthday girl actually told us that she came back a week later with some school friends of hers, and the service was even worse than last time (how that is even possible, I don't know?!)
I only come here for drinks, but this experience was so bad, I might just give up on Julios and head over to Los Chilitos. At least they have half decent food, good beergaritas and the servers are actually friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"the shrimp taco was probably the most foul thing I have ever put in my mouth and I've put a lot in my mouth. no joke, I gagged and I never gag ;) plus the Sprite tasted weird. honestly just go to Taco Bell. our server was nice though."}
{"text":"Chips n salsa are not free, they charge 4.00 for more chips. I ordered the steak fajitas and was disappointed that I only got 7 slices of steak for the price. The last time I was here they served the Fajitas with rice and beans. Now those items are al a cart. So for 21.00 all you get is 7 slices of steak with sautéed onions and peppers. Was it delicious, yes! Was it worth the price, no! I would have given them 4 stars if they price reflected on the size of the meal. Wife and kidlets did enjoy Julios."}
{"text":"Service was horrible. Was received our appetizer before our drinks, never got cutlery, plates for the appetizer or napkins until our main course came. The hostess who seated us didn't look like she worked there as she was dressed very casually (leggings and a  plaid shirt), as the other lady who brought us our cutlery, etc.  Order came to the table wrong and no one could fix it and the food didn't come as decribed on their menu. In my quesadia I found a long hair in it. Drinks are poured way to heavy (a single tasted like a double). Never going back again!"}
{"text":"They have chips and unlimited salsa for cheap. Awesome drinks, friendly staff, good location and good (but pricey) food. I will be back"}
{"text":"When Julio's first opened many years ago the food wasn't bad.  Now they seem to just be relying on their location and their bulldogs (bottle of beer in a slush drink) to keep people coming back.  There is a great view of the river and downtown from the upstairs patio, but the food is bad and the service slow and inattentive.

Be sure to go over your bill before paying. Ours had an extra meal on it."}
{"text":"Half-assed tex-mex place made worse with Calgary's inflated costs. 

The food sucks, and they ding you every which way for food as well. Last month, I got the best ever tex-mex meal in HARVARD FUCKING SQUARE (most expensive rent in the USA) for, get this, double the portions, quadruple the taste, yet.... half the cost! Triple margaritas using Patron were $7! Here, $7 gets me a fucking glass of marg made with some crap tequila. Oh, and the server makes it seem like they are doing you a huge favor by providing you an extra serving of chips and salsa above the complimentary one. This place epitomizes the Scandinaviaization of our country. Ughhhhhhh. 

This place is an assault on my wallet, taste, and sensibility.

Remember the south park episode where the goth kids burn down the hot topic? That's what I imagine when I think of this place. Only that I'm not Mexican.... but you get the idea."}
{"text":"I ate here last Friday for my third time ever ... It was the only place I could think of after I forgot to make reservations at Chili Club Thai House :'( yes that was a sad moment haha. But I am glad we ended up at Julio's Barrio because it has a way of cheering me up! maybe it's because it's always busy, but the fun busy kind.

I usually order the tacos or the fajitas (thanks for the autocorrect iPhone! haha) it's consistent and if you've got an appetite; either of these are suited to fill you up!

The servers here are cool and usually entertaining adding their mix of any exciting things happening in their lives! For instance... my last server said she was going to be in this seasons Bachelor Pad Canada or something! I don't watch that show, but I can definitely empathize because its still pretty cool.

Julio's Barrio gets 4 stars from me!"}
{"text":"First time here and i will be back, service is great, thw food is delicious, comfortable enviroment and my margarita is awesome. So impressed"}
{"text":"Had an awesome time at Julio's this evening. Great food, convenient location, & awesome service! We did have to wait 20 minutes to get a seat in the patio but it wasn't a big deal since Kensington has lots to see & makes 20 minutes feel like nothing! After we got our seat, everything was exactly how I would want it to. Our server was really sweet & super fast on her feet .. almost too fast! we'd just sat down & bam! he was right there! Even after we got our food .. I didn't even have enough time to snap some shots of our amazingly presentable food before she asked how it was! (it was delicious by the way) Very pleased with this place & will most certainly go back & drag everyone i know with me!"}
{"text":"I keep finding myself back at Julio's every one in a while for their delicious bull dogs - the Bichon Frise is my favourite. If you want an easy night out with some friends, I reccomend this place...

...that is, unless you're hungry. I stopped eating here a few years ago. The food is mediocre at best. There are so many GREAT places to chow down on Mexican food fare in this city - I probably wouldn't pick Julios!

The gal that helped us out a few nights ago, if I'm not mistaken, said she was being promoted to AGM. She was phenomenal. Relaxed and upbeat. It's nice to see they are promoting good people there!

I'll be back for the drinks-, especially if I can enjoy one on the patio in the summer!"}
{"text":"Kitchen has no concept of what it means to layer nachos. It also looked like they dumped all the broken chips underneath the pile of nachos. Took the chicken as the meat option and it was a small portion. Below average.  2 stars for including guacamole."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre Mexican food. I ordered enchiladas and the tortillas were extremely dried out. The rice and enchilada sauce did not have much flavor. The staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Original Mexican Bulldog's for the win! 

I recently moved to Calgary, and since then when anyone mentions the neighbourhood over the bridge (Kensington) they always tell me about Julio's and the amazing Bulldogs they serve. So on Friday night, I stopped in with a few friends to try the notorious Mexican Bulldog. 

Upon arriving at Julio's we were greeted immediately and told that there was about an hour wait, but we could sit at the bar. This was not an issue since we weren't going to be having dinner, seeing as it was 9:30pm. After snagging four seats at the bar, the bartender immediately gave us a drink menu, but we knew what we wanted and ordered immediately. I couldn't even tell you what was on the menu since I didn't open it. I knew I wanted an Original Mexican Bulldog with no salt. (Not sure if they typically salt their margaritas since when I said it the bartender said he personally doesn't add salt? Company policy? Not sure.) When my drink was placed in front of me, I was instantly impressed. Not only was it a fantastically made margarita that was delicious, but it was served in a chalice with a mini corona in it giving it the \"yeah, I'm a tourist\" feel that allowed you to believe you were really on vacation at an all inclusive resort. I recommend this drink to novelty margarita drinkers everywhere. 

If you stop in at Julio's and are debating to grab a table or sit at the bar.. Choose the bar. The bartender on Friday night honestly made the experience that much more enjoyable. He was witty, funny, and entertaining. By the time we left, he has us laughing so hard we were crying. It was everything a bar seating experience should be. And to boot, he made quick delicious drinks. My only regret was not getting his name so I could acknowledge him formally. 

The decor was cliche touristy Mexican, and I instantly loved it. It had a family travel feel complete with sombreros, maracas, and wooden paneling that lead me to believe they were trying hard to keep the Mexican vibe, but didn't want anyone to know they were trying hard to do so. The atmosphere was fun and energetic. It seemed everyone there was happy and celebrating. Their enthusiasm was encouraging and actually forced us to have a second bulldog before leaving. Well done touristy Mexican Julio's, well done."}
{"text":"I was in Calgary last week and had some family who suggested this restaurant. It's located in the Kensington area so very nice vibe though parking can be challenging.

I really enjoyed the food here. It was refreshing to have Mexican food in the middle of Calgary. The vibe of the place was great and the place was busy. I had the fish tacos and it tasted fresh and authentic. The free nachos with their salsa had a good kick to it. We also ordered the quesadilla and the patiacitas which was a nice cheesy snack.

I do recommend this place but perhaps also good to share your meal because the portions are big. The price is a bit higher than other Mexican joints I've been to as well.

Here's my Vlog of my recent visit to Julio's Barrio

{"text":"I have heard so many people talk about how great Julio's is...... are you kidding me?? I was \"feeling\" Julio for 4 days after, not only myself but everyone I was with. This place is funky and is fun, but when you have some long haired hippy sitting at the bar pounding back bulldogs and talking about the joint and how the 'kitchen' sucks it sort of makes you want to throw up in your mouth, wait is sorta did, that this is the kind of person cooking my food. Well okay fine I am being hard on the guy and sure it was after his shift BUT STILL... YUK...

Okay onto the service, the guy that served us took 10 mins to come get our drink order, 20 mins to bring us our drinks, 20 mins to come take our order andwhat seemed like a life time have our food come out to us. WHICH WAS VERY FUNNY because tables that where seated AFTER us got their food before us, I guess you need to have your tits half hanging out to get ANY attention from the make servers.

The bill was so high we had to take a triple look, it was the bill of a night out at a bar. 

Will I eat here again, maybe if it was the last place to get food on earth.

I just dont get what the hype was over this joint, it sucked and the servers were eaither clueless or rude and clueless.

FML do not eat here or your guts and wallet will be mad at you for days."}
{"text":"Last night I met up with a friend of mine that I haven't seen for a few years. I let him decide where we should go and he took me to Julio's Barrio.

First of all, its location is prime. Right in the heart of Kensington, it's actually where the old Red Robin used to be. I have fond memories of the Red Robin, so clearly I was already partial to the location.

When we got inside a friendly server took us to a booth. I love booths, so you can imagine my delight. 

Everyone gets chips & salsa to start, and they are VERY tasty. Had I not checked myself, I probably would have filled up on them and had no room left for dinner. But don't worry fellow Yelpers, I was on my best behaviour and only had a few :)

The first thing I noticed about Julio's menu is that it's VERY vegetarian-friendly! Nachos, Tacos, Burritos, OH MY! Plus Enchiladas, Chimichangas, Quesadillas....you get the point. I LOVE when restaurants have things for me to eat, I really do.

I ended up ordering the veggie Enchiladas and they were very tasty! Believe it or not, after inhaling chips, salsa and a full plate of veggie Enchiladas, I STILL had room for dessert. We split (uh, more like i ate 90% of it all on my own) the Mexican Fried Ice Cream. I love fried ice cream and I wasn't disappointed by their take on it.

I would recommend Julio's Barrio as a cool, hip Mexican hang out.

Make your way over and remember to have a Margarita for me when you do."}
{"text":"I had drinks and nachos at Julio's.  They were the worst nachos I have ever had.  Nachos without cheese?  What's up with that?  If you don't put cheese on the baked tortilla chips then they aren't nachos.  They are hot tortilla chips sprinkled with chopped olives, green peppers and canned jalapeno slices accompanied by small amounts of tasteless guacamole, salsa and sour cream.  

I also had two drinks -- the Julio's version of a caeser, but made with tequila.  Okay tasting, but with no discernible tequila content.  Couldn't taste it, didn't feel it. 

Nachos without cheese and tequila drinks without tequila?  Well, if that is what you want, you can go to Julio's Barrio to get it."}
{"text":"The service here is absolutely TERRIBLE. It doesn't seem to matter when you go there, either. I've been there twice, once when it was busy and once when it wasn't.
 When it was busy I spent about 4 hours there... at least 2 of which were waiting for food/drinks. At least I had some entertainment. The older (25 or so) server hitting on the underage girls celebrating a 16th bday and serving them enough alcoholic beverages to tranquilize a horse... My food (when it arrived was. 1. the wrong item and 2. not that good at all. They do make good enough drinks, when the bartender is actually focusing on drinks and not fooling around with his buddies who are there visiting him.
 When it wasn't busy... I stood around waiting to be seated for 15 minutes. Then finally a young lady popped out and went \"oh sorry, are you waiting to be seated?' NO, I'm standing here because I want to. WHAT THE HELL DO YOU THINK. Got seated and it went well from there. But yet again, food really wasn't that great. And the y REALLY need to start ID-ing those who are going to be drinking there.
 PS it's too expensive for what you get. If you want good Mexican go to Salt & Pepper's off of MacLoead Trail. Near Chinook."}
{"text":"#122 I love the location near Memorial and 10th St in Kensington.

The TV's always have the latest sporting events. The restaurant is reasonably clean including the washrooms.

But the love ends there. 

The service is hit or miss on a nearly consistent basis. Pricing wise, $15.50 for a burrito that is not very large or full of quality ingredients. For that price, I expect a larger portion, more and higher quality ingredients, and for it to do a lambada. Heaven forbid should you want gmo chicken or steak, add $4.00.

I have been 7+ times hoping it would get better since it does have potential but hope springs internally lost.

And, it is not even open late.

This is almost an abomination. They need to do better before the competition arrives."}
{"text":"The food here is very tasty, not the best. But close. I also like their margaritas. We went to another Mexican restaurant last week and the seating was horrible. The seating at Julio's is very comfortable. Parking can be a challenge, but if you are within walking distance, it is worth the walk."}
{"text":"I think this will be my last visit here and I urge whoever goes here to order bottled beer and avoid the Margaritas at all costs. You would think they would make a good drink during Sun and Salsa? Nope, I have lost hope that this will ever happen. I tried the margs frozen and on the rocks and it is confirmed that the cheap mix they use is downright horrible.
The restaurant was busy due to the festival, servers were frazzled and at the bar area, glasses, lemons, limes, receipts and staplers were flying. We had a really awkward spot at the bar and getting good service was tough. It is too bad as this place - the space itself and the location is Prime and this could be something if it tried. Even though hungry, we were smart enough to avoid the food.
1 star for the Mariachi band. Another star because I feel sorry for this place and the lost potential."}
{"text":"When you go to Julio's, you are going because you want to sit outside and enjoy the view of the river. That's it; the food's completely average, I cannot even remember anything about the last server I had, and the prices were, let's say, generous for what you get.

But, the river. It IS a nice view."}
{"text":"Great location on the side of memorial drive in Kensington, but honestly, I live in San Diego, and I get authentic Mexican food, but this place was just wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy to overpriced!!!

the only thing that REALLY made me super duper happy was they had my Tapatio hot sauce. mmmm!"}
{"text":"Julio's has a great location. It's colourful decor and second floor patio make this a fun place to have a beer or a margarita in the summer. Sadly, beyond these features Julio's is unremarkable. Service and food quality is average. 
During a recent visit we were served a small bowl of broken chips and salsa. We literally counted only three unbroken chips in the basket. There were several of us at the table, so they went fast. I asked for a refill and was told I would be charged $5.00 for a second basket. Seriously? A good restaurant would have replaced the broken fragments we were originally served, on pride alone, at no charge. I can't recommend them anymore."}
{"text":"Go to Julio's Barrio because you want to sit in the sunshine on a gorgeous roof top patio in Kensington that overlooks the river and drink a variety of 3 ounce margaritas in a giant plastic goblet with a full beer dumped upside down on them. They call them \"Bulldogs\" and they are lovely. If this is what you're looking for, as I often am, you'll have a fantastic experience.

Whenever I'm summertime bar-hopping in Kensington, a bulldog at Julio's is always a part of the process.  I enjoy the colourful and kitsch Mexican decor and I always get great, friendly service.

On the restaurant side of things, I've eaten here a good number of times over the years and I've never really been too impressed with the food. I'm willing to overlook authenticity and I have a special place in my heart for americanized cheesy, sour-creamy mexican, but I always wind up feeling like I've paid too much for what it was. If you're looking for a lot of food and a little less concerned about the quality, Julio's might be for you. Personally, I just like to come here to get sloshed in the sunshine.

No, it's not authentic, but yes it can be a great deal of fun."}
{"text":"Food is ok, but pricey and the service is terrible.

From the time we ordered to the time our food arrived was just over an hour. Ok I understand it is busy and can take a while.... that is not what bugged me.

What bugged me is that after 5 min of placing our order we got nachos and salsa given to us. Then 5 min later they brought my younger brother (who ordered Fajitas) tortillas. We waited 45 minutes and by then we were starving. I talked to the waitress and asked her when the food would be there. I explained I am diabetic and need to eat at certain times and would I be able to have some more nachos and salsa to munch on until the food came. Well 25 min later food showed up, the tortillas (now sitting on the table for an hour) were stone cold. My brother asked for warm tortillas and the waitress actually refused saying that they were not meant to be warm and that the food was warm and not to worry. The salsa and chips showed up at the same time as the meal. They billed me $6 for them and I didn't eat them. Not impressed.....

I will say that the place is always busy (I go to Gratitude Cafe a few doors down and notice the lines) so perhaps this was an isolated issue."}
{"text":"Checked out the reviews before we went. Service seemed to be a concern from past customers and I'm afraid it is still a concern. We were given a booth upstairs and then were ignored for 15+ minutes until we decided to address it with a hostess who was not attending our area.
The manageress came to our table and sincerely apologized. She offered us drinks on the house for our inconvenience.
We accepted and received margaritas of our choosing. From that time on, service was good and the food was authentic and very good. My wife had a fried banana dessert which wasn't to her taste. I had the fried ice cream which was delicious.
I understand it was a Saturday night which is understandably busy. It seemed that they didn't have enough staff to accommodate the guests.
I always wanted to come to this restaurant as it looks great and inviting from the outside. 
I would come back again as the food was good and management was willing to make us happy after not being attended to at the start."}
{"text":"If you are coming from a city or state that actually has good Tex-Mex or Mexican food, this place will be highly disappointing.  I usually compare new places on their basic cheese enchiladas and guacamole.  I tried to order cheese enchiladas here, but they did not even have it.  Opted for the enchiladas de carne (meat enchiladas for all you northerners), but what I got made Taco Bell look like fine dinning! The enchiladas were very small and dried out, almost like they had been microwaved too long - which is probably how they cooked them in the kitchen. I have had better rice and beans straight out of the can. To top it off, the guacamole was absolute crap, so I am glad the portions were so small.

Calgary has some good restaurants, but this is not one of them. Save your money and time, and go else where.  Even Taco Bell would be better!"}
{"text":"Trying to find really authentic Mexican food in Alberta is a little tricky but this was still a good meal. The cost is there but for us the food portions made up for it. Really friendly servers and a nice atmosphere. I crave spicy and the hottest salsa was finally something with a little flavour, overall a good experience."}
{"text":"I've come here twice now and both times I've left feeling that the meal was ridiculously expensive. It wouldn't be so bad if the food was actually good but I've had Mexican food at Taco Time which was more enjoyable. If you are looking for good Mexican food in Calgary, stay well a way from this place."}
{"text":"I love the Bulldogs here! I would go back for drinks on the patio. Would probably avoid the food though. I had the fajitas which were dry. My friend had the enchilada and paid for it later!"}
{"text":"I cannot speak for the food these days, since years ago I have not ventured back into chowing any of Julio's grub after a bout of food poisoning. Their drinks though, muy bien!! I'm a fan of the free chips and salsa to start, pairs nicely with my Bulldog beverage. A Bulldog is basically a beergarita, beer dunked upsidedown in a gourd of margarita, sometimes with other alcohols and flavours. These drinks are pricey at first glance, but really gives you a bang for your buck! It's a lot of alky, and deliciousness. The service was fantastic in my experience, and the patio upstairs rocks in the summertime. They have an iPad automated seating system I guess, which is cool and tech-savvy. To inform you that your table is ready for you to be seated, you can opt to get a text message sent straight to your cell phone. How cool!

Definitely worthwhile stop for predinner drinks and possibly some snacks"}
{"text":"The best thing I can say is that I sat in a comfy booth with the love of my life watching the hockey playoff games and had a good margarita.....
Chips out of a bag were less than par! They brought out a salsa sampler platter which was interesting presentation but I had to add a fair amount of salt because they were so bland tasting.
Everything else we ordered was marginal at best."}
{"text":"We tried this place based on he recommendation of some friends and also the fact that it is always busy and packed inside.
Their service was OK but the single pomegranate margarita that I got tasted just like ice and a little pomegranate juice. The food was not anything special, and beside all of this it was really expensive.
I guess I should trust the reviews on this website more :)"}
{"text":"Great food. Excellent atmosphere. Awesome music. Service is prompt but then there aren't many people here at noon on a
Monday."}
{"text":"If you're going to Julio's and are not drinking, you are doing it wrong.

Julio's Barrio is a great place to go to enjoy some drinks along with some standard Mexican fare. The only reason in my mind to go is to drink ridiculous \"bull dogs\" which are margaritas with shots and a beer tipped into them. The novelty of this drink is quite fun and they end up being pretty tasty. Don't expect the prices to be cheap or the service to be that fast as I have almost always had to wait to even get a table. The food is alright but I believe it is quite over priced.

Go for the bull dogs, or don't go at all."}
{"text":"This was our first time eating here and definitely will not be the last. 
Hubby and I wanted somewhere fun, un-stuffy and different to eat to celebrate our anniversary this year and we found Julio's to be the best choice.  Even with some of the bad reviews that were posted, it still became our first choice because I didn't understand how a place that was too busy to to accommodate us initially for a reservation would be a bad place to go.  Thankfully, a cancellation occurred and the manager called me to see if we still wanted a table (the first sign that the customer service would be really good was in that phone call).
The Bulldog's were awesome and our meal was delicious.  Our server Megan was the sweetest (give this girl a raise!), and the dessert at the end of our meal was a very welcome treat (thanks to Megan and her manager).
I really look forward to our next visit to Julio's Barrio."}
{"text":"Good food. Great ambiance. Nice people. Must have the original bulldog. 
Tinga chicken tacos and Chicken quesadillas are good"}
{"text":"Today was the second time I've visited Julio's Barrio - last time I visited was approximately three years ago so I was anticipating the obvious, such as different staff members and even the food taste/quality. For my first time there, I ordered fajitas con carne, which was slightly expensive compared to its quantity, but was delicious. Today, I ordered Pollo en Chipotle and was happy and sad to discover it had the same con and pro, regarding its price and the tastiness of the meal. 

The chicken was cooked very well - it was moist inside, but slightly charred outside such that the meat didn't break off too easily. Also, the well cooked exterior made the texture crispy on the outside and added a slight bitterness to the otherwise sweet and spicy chicken; the flavours complemented each other very well. The corn salad that came as a side was fresh and had a bit of spice from black pepper, and salsa was of a mediocre quality (as in it was okay, but nothing impressive). Overall, the food was good. The only problem was that despite having three side dishes, it really was not filling at all. I was hungry in about an hour, and I'm the type of person who eats approximately two average-sized meals per day. Considering that the cost of what I ordered was almost twenty dollars, and that the quality of the food was not anything mind-blowing, I thought that I was not getting fully of what I paid for. 

As for the service, I was there at 3PM so there were may be only two other tables that were occupied. Therefore, I cannot give them the full credits with a confident credibility for providing a good service,as I just don't know or can't recall if the same quality of service will be provided when the restaurant is busier. The fried tortillas that were given as soon as we sat down was pretty good, and I enjoyed the gum they handed out after the bill was paid for. The service was adequate and efficient, but as I have said above, I cannot guarantee it will be the same during the rush hours. 

In conclusion, did I enjoy my experience in Julio's Barrio? If I had been crazily craving for a good-quality Mexican food, I might have given a full \"yes\", but what I wanted then was just to get my stomach filled. While the food was delicious, it was not exactly deserving of the price tag that it came with. Will I return to Julio's Barrio any time soon? Probably not. I am a university student after all, and I like seeing the money I paid actually paying off. This place seriously needs to cut down on their price, if they want to do a fair business.

Three stars out of five! Hope this review helped :D

{"text":"This restaurant teaches their staff to tell their customers what they DON'T do. We don't do this, we don't do that, we can''t do that, it's company policy!
Really, really? Whatever happened to 'trying' to accommodate the customer, trying to make sure you and your party are made happy and WILL return. Perhaps bringing up in a staff meeting what you CAN do for the customer would be a clever subject.
LOUSY service, mediocre food, overly priced, a novel interior, the food quality is sub par and overall it's just a lack luster experience. Their ONLY saving grace is that they have an outdoor patio, But they WON'T take reservations for that either!
BIG disappointment - End of story.
Don't say you weren't warned...."}
{"text":"Bulldogs are so wonderfully tasty.  Theirs are great.  The food isn't even near-decent.  The nachos were the same drab crap you get in a pub.  You're a Mexican restaurant.  You should be able to at least make great nachos.  Since you didn't, I will be forever skeptical on any other food I may try.  Great service, and bulldogs that are the perfect sweet/bitter mix.  That's the only reason you get 3 stars.  I'll just glare at the restaurant for a while until it is better."}
{"text":"Nice location, decor and view for a drink.

Service poor.  Food could only be called Mexican in Canada.

Looked like my plate was made several hours earlier then warmed in a microwave.  Came down with Motezuma's revenge that night."}
{"text":"The only reason you'd want to come here is for the \"experience\".  It's for a cool vibe, and is packed with the \"young and beautiful\" crowd.  I can imagine that the patio is wonderful.  That's where it ends.  

I started with Sangria.  It was awful.  There were lumps of some random seedy fruit in it (might have been blackberries) that kept clogging the straw.  Next I tried a margarita.  it wasn't good either - premix out of a machine, separated, overly salty.  Yuk.

The food was just slop.  I've spent a lot of time in Mexico and the US Southwest, and lived in Southern California, so I know a thing or two about Mexican and Tex-Mex.  This is neither.  The tortilla chips to start were pre-fab out of a bag, and the salsa that went with it had a lot of heat, but no real flavor.  My chimichanga was just mush with no flavor but loads of salt.  I'm still thirsty 12 hours later.

So, if you're in the young and cool crowd, and want a place where you can see and be seen, this might be for you.  if you have even the most basic knowledge of Mexican or Tex-Mex food, stay away.  You'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"Putting garbage on colored plates doesn't make it any more fun to eat. To make Mexican food, you need flavor. I'm not Mexican, but grew up in the US. Please, my Canadian friends, don't be fooled by loud salsa music and Spanish-y words on a menu."}
{"text":"Service was generally very bad. There were lots of empty tables and even more wait staff yet nobody came to our table ever, even when we tried to wave them over. One server looked straight at one of us (who was motioning) and walked past us. Wait staff were rude when they did come. Nachos took over half an hour to come. They arrived cold and the cheese hard. Overall terrible experience. Do not recommend."}
{"text":"A few weeks ago I took a girlfriend from out of town here on a sunny day. We sat upstairs on the patio, which was decorated with colorful Mexican flair. The patio is a great place to people watch along very busy memorial drive. You can also watch the bow river from the patio, which is lovely on a summer day! 

The service was OK, it wasn't the best or the worst. The server was friendly and knowledgeable, but she really busy and didn't visit the table as often as would have been expected. 

The food here, I thought, was amazing! For a starter we ordered the tostadas, they were so delicious and filling that I wasn't too hungry for my main meal of Veggie Tacos (even though I still managed to eat one taco).  I loved the tacos as well! The food here is amazing and I will be returning to try more of this delightful menu!!

You will want to note that the road noise on the patio is a low drone. As Julio's is in Kensington area the parking is at a premium on the weekends. There is a few pay to park lots in the area."}
{"text":"Welcome to Julio's Barrio, the Moxies of Mexican restaurants. They've stayed in business so long by appealing to the lowest common food denominator, having a great location, super perky servers and decent loungeish decor. You can bring a picky person here no problem, but I've always felt it appealed to people who haven't had the opportunity to try genuine Mexican food. Head down to Expo Latino for some good examples in Calgary proper.

The food was mediocre and kind of bland, and not much better than Taco Tuesdays (and A LOT more expensive that that tex-mex institution). I did enjoy the fishbowl margaritas, but that's my favourite part of Moxie's too :) The prices combined with the so-so food (I can see why people find it appealing, but it is barely Mexican) make it a destination I try to stay away from."}
{"text":"Me and a few friends visited Julio's on Saturday. The food was great but expensive. So were the drinks. Service was fast and friendly. One thing I didn't enjoy was the music volume. I enjoy music playing when I am out however it was tough to have a conversation across the table without yelling. Overall it was a good experience."}
{"text":"Great location, good service, good food and excellent service. I enjoyed most of all the friendly and professional service we got.
It was not cheap though!

There is covered pay parking next to the restaurant, which is very convenient, and the place is big enough for large groups.
We had a great time."}
{"text":"After meeting my sister in Kensington for what was supposed to be an evening drinking tea and walking the river, we scrapped that idea and instead decided to have drinks on a patio. Since we were close by, we opted for Bulldogs and headed over to Julio's. We weren't going for food, because we're smart enough to know that Julio's does NOT do good food, but the Bulldogs were pretty spot on. Sitting on the patio, watching the river flow and people enjoying the sunny day, sipping our big silly drinks...it was great. I made the mistake of eating a few chips with salsa (the waitress put them right in front of me, C'MON) and had a horrible stomach ache for the rest of the night. My sister said Julio's got ya...they'll get ya every time. Stick to the drinks, and you should be ok. The Bichon Frise Bulldog is heavenly!"}
{"text":"My youngest son took myself and his brother out to lunch yesterday and we arrived at Julio's.  The staff were wonderful, as was the food and the 'bulldogs' flowed freely!!  We had a marvelous time!!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious, the ambience was great, and the server was phenomenal.  Why then would I give Julio's a 3 star rating?  Unexpectedly, the major let down at this restaurant was the Hostess.  Rude, standoffish, and a flat out liar, I found her to really hurt the experience.  She set a negative tone to the entire visit until our server bailed her out of the fire.  Telling everyone that you're full up when you can clearly see that the tables are all empty and only 2 out of 30 have \"reserved\" signs on them is not credible.  Also, changing the time estimate twice in the same sentence is also not credible.  Is it 15 mins or 45 mins?  Its the same sentence, what caused the extra half hour delay?"}
{"text":"Schönes Restaurant, gutes Essen und eine sehr sehr freundliche Bedienungen!
Kann ich nur empfehlen."}
{"text":"Great selection of Bulldog's!! It's an alcoholic drink. But I discovered beer does not agree with me so my new favourite drink is lime margarita and they use proper kosher salt for rim!! Food was good but spicy!! Taco salad with extra sour cream is phenomenal! My son ordered it but I had a taste Wow!! My hubby and I ordered the pasta with steak it was great but too spicy for me. Hubby loved it! We were served by a newbie Clarence, his first day, he was great and his trainer was helpful and they were polite and attentive. Mexican is not my favourite food but we will be back."}
{"text":"This place sucks money out of your wallet faster than speedy Gonzales. 

I'm going to put it bluntly: I come here for their Bulldogs. I like the novelty of an upside down beer plopped right in the middle of a girly drink. I like that it's more alcoholic than Lindsay Lohan's breath. I like that they make many varieties of this beverage.

If you've got $25 - $50 to spend on a few drinks, Julio's will please your little sombrero-wearing butt just fine. Service is usually pretty attentive, depending on when you go - so no complaints.

But the rent must be ASTRONOMICAL for them to be charging this much for average-at-best tex mex.

Steak fajitas ring in at roughly one arm and one leg, while anything else will only cost you a few appendages. A lovely lady and I sat down for dinner. I was planning on popping out a pair of earrings I bought her at Tiffany's, but when I saw the bill I realized I'd need to take out a second mortgage just to pay for my meal, so I shipped those little buggers right back.

Seriously though: two meals, a few drinks, and BOOM - $85. I'm no cheapskate, but if I'm paying $85 for Mexican it better be served to me by a man playing Spanish Guitar, and a hand-woven poncho better be my bib.

I mean, I've eaten out of food trucks in Mexico that made more compelling and authentic food. That's not to say the food is BAD, it just isn't worth what you fork out for it.

I can't give this place anything better than an \"OK\". Will I come back here again? Probably, when someone else wants to tip back a giant fishbowl of liquor. 

But until then, I just can't afford it."}
{"text":"I've been to the Edmonton Julio's, and got addicted to their famous Bulldogs.

This Julio's specifically was not so great. One bulldog gave me a nasty headache the next morning, and I'm sure it wasn't because of the amount of liquor they put in. I'm basing my assumptions around the tequilla they were using, because it also tasted funny (even after flagging the waitress down to get another bulldog it still tasted a bit off).

The food was alright, I've had a lot better mexican food in my day.

All in all, I don't recommend it."}
{"text":"Such bad management/planning 
We went there on a lovely warm Saturday - we were expecting the place to be busy but we did not expect to walk into an almost empty restaurant and be told that there was a 30minute wait. 
The front desk explained there was only 1 server working on the entire floor. She was extremely apologetic and we decided to wait. As we waited we enjoyed some nice drinks but we could see a huge amount of lost business in people who chose not to wait for an empty restaurant. 
Food was good - they forgot the meat on our nachos and the sizzling fajitos looked amazing."}
{"text":"I have read all the horrible reviews about this place, and yet we still came here because wife and I were walking home one night and fancied a nightcap and, well, we were right in front of this place.  Well, the Yelpers were right. I can't think of a single redeeming quality about this \"restaurant\" apart from the fact that it has a primo location, and if you're a young single hetero guy, you may be happy to know that the customers are about 75% young single female, many who were part of bachelorette parties. There were also a few young couples on what appeared to be first date nights (if someone brought me here on a first date, I would have RUN the other direction). Wife and I walked in and were completely ignored by the hostess staff. So we walked past straight to the EMPTY large bar, pulled up some stools and waited. And waited. I checked my watch and it took 4 minutes, 30 seconds for service, even though we were the only patrons at the bar.  Ordered a beer and a margarita and it arrived in about 30 seconds flat, which makes me think the margarita was poured out of a pre-mixed jug in the back. Ewww, it was SICKLY sweet -- akin to pure corn syrup and sugar water with some neon green food coloring -- and no alcohol that we could detect. At least the beer was real. We did not eat the food after reading all the previous reviews, plus the fact that the restaurant smelled of burnt tortillas and overcooked fajitas did no favors. The decor looked like ever stereotypical Mexican cliche rolled into one, chewed up, then regurgitated onto the walls. No thank you."}
{"text":"When one needs a margarita with a full corona overturned in its giant, novelty plastic margarita glass - one would seek out Julio's. Guess who learned what a \"Bulldog\" was last week?

If the name, ingredients and plastic glassware don't give it away - Julio's is a good one to tie one on. Down to \"Sparkle Donkey\" tequila on the back bar, this place screams mischief... \"I want to re-live my early 20's\" mischief or, as the rest of the clientele will speak to, \"i'm currently living my early 20's\" mischief.

For a giant glass of alcohol that will prove to be endlessly amusing Instagram fare - this is worth a duck into. For anything else... who knows? I went for the Bulldogs."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst mexican restaurants I've ever been to. The food is NOT authentic, it's bland, canned and overall put together badly. Definitely NOT fresh. The contrived decor doesn't do anything other than make you hate it more. I wish I could say something positive...but it wasn't even clean the last time I went in there. Never again."}
{"text":"The atmosphere in Julio's is truly astounding. Unfortunately everything else just seems a little off. Their menu is lacking variety. Their drinks are incredibly overpriced and add up quickly. How does a margarita cost $15? I mean honestly. 

I had the steak fajitas which were tasty. However there was very little meat compared to the amount of veggies in the skillet. They could have cut the steak a little more to save me the trouble of doing so. I ended up with huge wads, and subsequently lacking bites. The fajita wraps themselves didn't taste as fresh as one might like. And there wasn't quite enough guac/salsa/sour cream and cheese to last the whole meal. As well I didn't get an extra plate where I could assemble each fajita so I ended up using the one that came under the napkins. My friend didn't get one either so he reused mine a little later on. They had us in a corner booth with tight access to the wall seats and butt numbing pull up seats. I was very uncomfortable towards the end of the meal.

Our waitress was very slow. We waited over ten minutes for our bills which had to be changed twice more despite her taking notes as we identified what we each had to eat and drink. Also I didn't like that they tacked on an 18% gratuity without notifying us just because we had a large group. That seemed like such a thankless response for us bringing them so many customers. I don't normally tip that much, let alone for less than satisfactory service. Three margaritas and a plate of fajitas should not cost $80. It just shouldn't. 

I will avoid this place as best I can because there is just so much better value available in this great city."}
{"text":"Food seemed cheap quality. Not impressed at all. Great location but I would consider this more like a Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Very cool ambience and all the food was very good... The drinks were great!! And the service not bad... It's a great place to go with a group of friends and have fun... I was surprised of this place food, as I was expecting more like a bar food, but it was way better than that... The margaritas were just delicious!! I definitely enjoyed this place sooo much!!!"}
{"text":"Other reviewers have complained about the service, but I have to say that when we went tonight - 5:30pm on a Wednesday - the service was great. Attentive hostess, server, and the food came out fast. The reason for the three star rating? The food was entirely mediocre, and it was quite expensive ($18 for a burrito with rice and beans). I love Mexican food, but there aren't that many places in Calgary to get great Mexican food. This is definitely not one of them,"}
{"text":"Great drinks, pretty good food, and bad service every time. After going here for years here and there, it never changed. Servers seem miserable and don't visit enough, probably because they're perpetually understaffed."}
{"text":"Looking for a good Mexican restaurant?  Well, Julio's Barrio is certainly a great place to have an authentic meal.

I've never been to Mexico, but I think dining at Julio's is probably the closest I'll ever get!  The decorations seem authentic and the atmosphere definitely screams Mexican.  I've been a couple of times and am never disappointment upon leaving.

Obviously, we usually get some margarita's when we go to Julio's because they are tasty and reasonably priced.  I usually get an enchilada or quesadilla to eat, but I've branched out a couple of times when I'm feeling saucy.  They have a wide selection to choose from and everything seems so delicious.  

The prices are pretty average... that's to say I don't feel like I'm getting ripped off eating here.  It's good food, a good experience, and just a good time in general.  I would recommend Julio's to anyone in the mood for a Mexican night out!"}
{"text":"We (my husband and myself), have only gotten the chance to eat here once so far, but are planning to return in May when family come to visit. The hostess was just coming down the stairs as she saw us waiting to be seated. \"Let me guess, you want to sit upstairs  on the balcony, right?\" I'm thinking \"Well duh. It's a beautiful day and Canada's summers are short.\" But instead I said \"We can seat ourselves, If it's a problem.\" \"No no no,\" she says, \"it's my job. Follow me.\" And another trip of cardio up the stairs followed. Despite that erm......\"friendly\" greeting, the food was pretty and tasted great. The drinks were delicious. But the biggest selling point, was of course, just getting to lounge on the balcony and sip margaritas. It was packed too, there was almost no one in the actual restaurant."}
{"text":"I can't say I've ever enjoyed a meal that I've ordered at Julio's. So I stopped coming here for dinner and just drop by if people want to go for drinks or dessert. I have nut allergies so the fact that they're a nut free facility is wonderful. Their desserts are fairly large and tasty and you can't go wrong with sitting on the patio overlooking the river & downtown on a summer night!

The service also really varies. There have been times when I have received exceptional service and other times when the server hasn't been friendly or didn't come by even once."}
{"text":"This place had been recommended a number of times, so my wife and I decided to try it last night.  Unless you're going out for a night of drinking, this is not the place for you.  Neither of us were drinking last night, so I ordered a strawberry limeaid.  It was more like sort-of-strawberry-flavored-hint-of-lime-water; it was terrible.  Changed to a Coke and got charged for both.

Chips and salsa were good. My wife and I ordered the platter (a \"quesadilla\" and two enchiladas), mine was beef, hers was chicken.  Truly dreadful food.  No flavor, almost no cheese on the quesadilla, and the meet filling in both was incredibly bland.  Rice and beans were sub-par, and the \"corn salad\" was no better than mediocre.  Over-priced terrible \"Mexican\" food.  Will not be returning.

I agree with the Steve M. review on 4/20/16.  Stay away from this place, the food is terrible and way over priced."}
{"text":"Not bad Mexican food, but its not very authentic.  Prices are quite steep for the product as well.

Its a fun time for drinks with friends, but I wouldn't order food there."}
