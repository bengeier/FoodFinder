{"text":"Everything about this place is perfect. Maybe it's the fact that this place has always been loosely associated with the rumour that it's owned by Sean Paul's uncle, and that there's a framed
Photo of Sean Paul hanging out with the owner on the store wall. I've been going here since I was in high school, and Reggae brings up all sorts of wonderful nostalgic memories about being unable to drive, and hanging out with my friends during lunch over a toasty hot box of jerk chicken. It's mouthwatering and makes my heart flutter just thinking of it.

The Good: Everything. Serving size, prices, and jerk don't disappoint! I was never a fan of oxtail, but all of my friends who have had it swear by it. The jerk is perfectly marinated, the rice is flavourful, and the sauce is plentiful. I love the lunchtime deals. HUGE shoutouts to CHRIS, who worked there back when I was in high school and who always had the best customer service- he was always grooving to his own beat behind the counter, chatting up customers and just genuinely enjoying life and his job. It made Reggae's feel like a home away from home. 

The Bad: Hours are a little limited. Someimes they're open, sometimes they're not. But when you can catch them when they are, you've hit jackpot!

The Ugly: Nada.

Love, love, love this place. Give it a try. Sean Paul will thank you."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the jerk pork. The pickled slaw was something new for me that I quite enjoyed."}
{"text":"Just not the same. New people running the place. Counter area crowded with too much stuff. I guess they are trying to discover what sells and what does not. Ambiance changed when new people took over. 
Even the flavors have changed. Not bad but not the great taste there was before.
And yes the prices have moved upward.
Time to find another gem."}
{"text":"Having left Toronto over ten years ago, I get to visit the city one or twice a year. A friend of mine introduced me to this place over the summer. 

The business motto of the owner is great, they cook a large quantity of rice and meat in the morning. On average they will have two or three different meat selections and salad and rice, after its gone they close down for the day. 

I can honestly say that the food quality was over any of my expectations, it was one of the tastiest meals I have ever had. 

Highly reced!"}
{"text":"The food is okay... I've had better.  I like the service.  The guys are nice and friendly."}
{"text":"8.50 for small take out box of plain rice with some sauce and 5 small pieces of chicken.  NOPE

Overall tasted OK but not worth it."}
{"text":"Great jerk chicken! I always enjoy this Reggae Kitchen. The decor is fine, and they have a bunch of Sean Paul autographed pictures on the wall which is kind of neat. Back to the food, the portions are somewhat on the larger side, but mostly filled with rice. Not to say that you don't get enough protein, you will, no worries. Just the ratio seems to be a bit off. The patties are ok, nothing special. Overall pretty good Caribbean food."}
{"text":"I have been going to Reggae Kitchen for at least 7 years, and it has always been wonderful. I found the place while I was attending the nearby high school, and have kept going back - even though I'm only in Toronto during the summer months because I'm away at university majority of the year. 
In high school, my friends and I went to this place almost every other day, or at least once a week, for 3 years, and we usually ordered the same things. The employees are always super friendly, and have no problem striking up conversation. They have customers from high school kids, to grown up families - and they are able to make the place extremely comfortable no matter your age. 
When I went away for university and came back, I did not expect them to remember me - but they certainly did! I guess it pays to visit the same restaurant so often as a kid. They even remembered my order, which I definitely enjoyed - the recipes haven't changed but the food is just as delicious.

RE: THE FOOD
I would highly recommend the jerk chicken, BBQ chicken, and jerk pork. The jerk items are spicy, but with the rice, it is the perfect compliment of flavour. They also serve soup, and although I've never personally tried, my friends that ate it every day had no complaints. They also have Jones soda, which is a great refreshing drink to wash down the food. Although the portions don't seem large, the amount of protein and carbs you get from the healthy serving of rice and meat, fills you up a lot faster than you originally think. I always get the small, and I'm always extremely satisfied with the portion they give me. 

I would definitely recommend this place - it is definitely a spot I introduce to out-of-town friends as a local hot spot. 5 of 5 stars."}
