{"text":"Absolutely horrible service would probably never come back. I was having a good time with the my friends and the crowd and as soon as I sat down they decided I was too drunk to be in the club and decided to kick me out. I asked for a reason because I was just tired and not drunk but they offered no explanation. All my friends had to leave the place. Absolutely horrible horrible service."}
{"text":"This is an amazing place to relax, eat, drink and line dance. It has a country and western theme and dress should be cowboy/girl like !  Free cloak service and mechanical bull ! $14:00 in or free if you book and go before 21:00. All in all it was epic ! A bit dear at the bar however. $9:25 for a pint of strongbow!!"}
{"text":"Based on recommendations, my friend had her birthday here on the weekend and we had a party of about 16 people. Reservations were taken ahead of time and we had free coat check at 7pm. However, this place was not the greatest based on their food. 

Our server was polite and divded our bills nicely by making sure our orders were placed under our names (though there was a mix up at the end of the night still...). Our group enjoyed the line dancing and mechanical bull. This was probably the biggest draw for us, and it was a lot of fun. 

However, since we came here for dinner as part of the birthday celebration, the food was a huge disappointment. A few ordered the nachos, steak, fries, and chicken wings, fried chicken and a fried portebello sandwich. The fries, sandwich and fried chicken turned out to be a huge bust because it was extremely salty. After a bite into our meals, we had told the server about going easy on the salt. Unfortunately, she had told us that there was nothing she could do about the food and salt content. For the 5 of us with the salty dinner, we left disappointed.  

Overall - good themed bar with line dancing and mechanical bull. Great song list. But food was a major disappointment and would not come here again for that."}
{"text":"So I came here with pretty high hopes. I'm in town for the week and have heard good things about this bar, how they play really great music, etc, and I love country, so I figured it'd be worth a shot. There are no country bars where I live. So we decided to hit it up. There was a line, which we anticipated, and it moved fairly quickly. When we got in we were asked to pay cover - $14. Okay, cool. Wasn't expecting it to be quite so much considering there was no \"well known\" dj or band playing, but whatever. Then we had to pay $4 for coat check. Ok. So in total we paid about 20 bucks to get into this bar....... so we're kinda expecting it to be great. The music as soon as we got in didn't disappoint! We obviously wanted a drink, so we went to the bar to get one. This is where it went way the f*ck down hill. We were able to walk right up to the corner where the registers were to get drinks, and I am not kiddin you when I say we waited 15 minutes. We quite literally watched men walk right up to the bar and get them right away. We made eye contact with the bar tenders and they quickly looked away. All 4 bar tenders near us were women ,but all bartenders in general were women at this certain bar. They hugged some of these male customers, clearly regulars or what have you. I was disgusted. I mean, my sister has worked as a bartender and I'm a full time customer service associate. First come, first serve or what have you and I TOTALLY get that it's busy, that it's gonna take a while to get a drink. It's just that we were right at the front of the bar, and witnessed men walk RIGHT up and get a drink RIGHT away. I was just truly sad to see so much sexism in this one establishment. Is it because women don't \"generally tipe as well\"? Will never return and will never recommend. Very, very disappointed."}
{"text":"This is absolutely my new favourite place in the city. Legit! 
I LOVE the atmosphere, to say the least. The mechanical bull, line dancing lessons, the music and the decor just make the place an absolute blast! It's so much fun! 

The only thing is that drinks and food are expensive there, but I heard that their wings are pretty amazing. 

I would love to come out for karaoke night. Definitely recommended for lovers of the cowboy/cowgirl experience ;)"}
{"text":"Ended up here when everyone in our group wasn't able to get into The Porch.  This wouldn't have been my first choice as I am not a huge fan of country music.  That said, there was lots of room for our big group and the drinks were flowing.  The best part was the bull riding which was a source of entertainment for our whole group.  We found a table close by and watched the action.  The males who attempted to ride the bull were tossed off quite quickly and seemed to be in some pain when exiting.... The ladies, especially those more scantily dressed, were kept on the bull a bit longer with a setting labelled \"sexy\".... I kid you not.  The operator of said bull was a cowboy boot wearing, tobacco chewing cowboy, who seemed to enjoy his job thoroughly.   Although slightly intimidated I managed to give it a try, and it was a blast.  I would come again with a group of people, as it was fun to hang out and get a few laughs at one another expense :)"}
{"text":"After google searching Country bars in Toronto this saturday, this place came up multiple times. Looked awesome with it's urban 'saloon' stylings and 'Bull' riding adventure. Couldn't wait to experience the rooftop patio which looked modern and somewhat upscale. The website says sign up online for the guest list and get in free before 9:30 and even with our best intentions to get out the door to meet that deadline, it didn't work out. Waited in a short line of 90% males under 25 to get in. It's a second floor bar approx. 80 ft x 40 ft and it's interior set up as a meat display. There isn't a space to chill and still feel part of the party. The 'Bull ring' at the end of the room is fenced in with wobbly parade style fencing that doesn't feel secure enough to lean on. The Bull itself looks like a second hand purchase and is taped together and ratty loooking with a disengaged operator reminding me of a pimply faced carny at the CNE. It was fun to watch people who obviously had never 'mounted' an animal of any kind and the looks on their beer soaked faces as they hit the mat. That lost it's appeal after 15 minutes but there isn't really anything or anywhere else to go in this bar. Looking through their website it's shown that the Porch is their upstairs rooftop patio but when you ask where it is the security staff grunt and point to the stairs going down the way we came in. The patio does not 'belong' to the Rock n Horse but is a seperate entity that requires an additional $10 cover. We felt ripped off by that omission on the website. The unceramonious drink delivery at the bar left you feeling pretty unimportant for having shelled out a days pay in watery cocktails. I can't say for certain but watching one of the fem bartenders, her mixed drinks were pretty damn short on 'pours.' I realized after this experience that I was hoping for a little Coyote Ugly or a little more effort but was dissappointed by a general lack of the 'fun factor' here. It's a 20 something 'cattle call' to suck at least $100 per person for listening to top 40 country hits. PS, no cowboys to be found."}
{"text":"Place was decent, went for a birthday party. Food came out slow but it was generally well liked. Staff is really friendly."}
{"text":"Brought a bunch of friends here -- all our first visit.
Great atmosphere and the staff are generally friendly. You need to get here before 9:30 if you expect to get in... so it definitely is not the type of place for young crowds who expect to \"pre-drink\" prior to their arrival. 

The music is almost entirely Country, as should be expected, which really adds to the whole experience. It is certainly different from anything in the entertainment district, which is nice if you're looking for a break from the grimy clubs that litter this area.

My friends and I decided to arrive a bit early for dinner... and had nachos, a couple of salads, brisket, burgers and guacamole. The food is totally sub-par and the reason for my low rating of the venue overall. None of my friends enjoyed the food, and we're not a picky bunch. I definitely would not eat here again.

The drinks are excellent though - I definitely recommend the Bulldog!

Go for the drinks, the unique atmosphere and the free mechanical bull rides - stay away from the food."}
{"text":"The place was a lot of fun in general, great atmosphere.  The main issue is that it takes about 45 minutes to get into or out of the coat check!"}
{"text":"Came for a friends bday dinner and the menu was preset. Was supposed to give us food for 18 people and it felt more like portions were for 10. Especially with taco bar and oddly enough each person was charged $20!! I ate one tiny taco! Felt totally jipped. Waitress got short with me when I asked for her to explain how bill was broken down. Food was good, didn't enjoy the quantity or price."}
{"text":"I often go to RnH for girls nights out - the music is great, good vibe and friendly people. The mechanical bull gives you a thrill and fun to watch. 
I've been a couple of times for dinner - I recommend having dinner here before a night out, so you can settle in before the crowd comes (and for guys to avoid the $14 cover)."}
{"text":"I went to the rock n horse for the first time last night and was very disappointed. As a person in a wheelchair I have never been treated so poorly at a bar. I was there to attend a friends birthday and upon arrival the security said I was not allowed in because I was in a wheelchair and they had stairs to get in. I understand the legal issues with the security guards carrying me in but they also wouldn't allow anyone else in line help to carry me in. Ive been to many other bars in Toronto that have had stairs and they never had a problem with me coming in. The security and management at the rock n horse were rude and I wouldn't recommend anyone who may need accommodations to go to this bar as they aren't willing to help."}
{"text":"Average food and horrible atmosphere. We had reservations here for our friend's birthday at 7 pm on a Saturday we went it ordered food by 8 pm. The music was so obnoxiously loud that it was hard to hear someone next to me without them yelling at the top of their lungs into my ear. Food was also very late and nothing above average. The mechanical bull was entertaining for a total of 15 minutes then it went downhill from there for everything else. It was impossible to speak to anyone at my table and there were 16 of us. We requested the waitress and the front of house TWICE to turn the music down a little and nothing was done. I do understand that they start line service after 10 pm but there's no need for annoyingly loud music during dinner hours and service early on in the night for the people enjoying a meal and wanting to socialize. It took forever to sort the bills out as the waitress wasn't clear at all about the bill and managing all of us and our bills. It took 40 minutes for us to figure out and yell at the top of our lungs to each other to get our message across to each other and figure it all out. They did give us $50 back but really, it doesn't make up for the time wasted and the disappointing night out with friends I don't get to see often all at the same time."}
{"text":"Save a horse, ride a cowboy!
I came here on a Friday night with some girls and we had a great time!
Who would have thought Toronto has so many fans of country music!

There were a lot of things I liked about this saloon.

1) You can buy margaritas by the bucket
2) You can bust out your cowboy hat
3) Plaid shirts aren't only for hipster venues
4) You can join the crowd and line dance
5) The mechanical bull is entertainment - all night long!

I will definitely be back! :)"}
{"text":"Fun place to dance, especially if you need to learn the steps first. ;)
The instructor was very good, just wish he was on an elevated stage/platform so you could see his feet better.
Small dance floor, but makes for a cozy atmosphere (as long as your fellow dancers can move). 
Fun bar food...had the nachos (vegan-style) and sweet potato fries. Yum!
After the dance lessons are over, this place turns into a club full of dancing girls and guys, definitely more energy. 
Great tunes!"}
{"text":"We came here on Saturday to celebrate my fiancé birthday. The booking process was a nightmare. I firstly emailed them and then after no reply called and was told to txt someone my reservation. After no reply my fiancé went there in person to book the table. When arriving on Saturday night we were told that our table was double booked and we would have to wait 15 mins to see if the other party came. As they didn't come we were allowed to have our table which we originally booked. The manager apologized and brought our party two coolers of beer. I appreciated this as my mood was killed at the beginning. The rest of the night was much fun. Our party had a lot of fun and being next to the bull they had lots of fun there. It got really busy at around 10 and if it wasn't for our table being in the corner I could imagine it would be very uncomfortable."}
{"text":"My daughters and I decided to check this place out while we were in town for the night. We were a little later getting in side then we had anticipated so they were looking to charge us 16 each for cover! We almost didn't stay but luckily one of the security/doormen or whoever our night in shining armour was, overheard me say it was my birthday so he let me in for free and my girls got in for $6! We had a blast! I rode the bull which I recommend anyone try at least once! The crowd was a great mix and we met a lot of friendly people. Not sure how but we ended the night with a blue cowboy hat for each of us...none of us remember who gave them to us or why....yep we definitely had a great time!"}
{"text":"Well after my negative review I was contacted by Seamus, the manger, who offered me a complimentary dinner for me and 3 friends. Took him up on it. Menu is basic but it is a country themed bar. There are some interesting choices such as kale for those who like that kind of stuff. The staff were very nice. Music was good. Everyone went out of their way to make sure we were happy. Pulled pork is on the peppery side opposed to sweet like in used to. Nachos were yummy. Popcorn chicken had a bit of a kick to it. All in all was a good meal."}
{"text":"Had a great time here last night. What's not to love? It is so much fun and there's so much  fun things to do to please everybody in the crowd. There's karaoke( my fave) of mainly country tunes, go figure, dancing and bull riding or just enjoying a beer and chatting with friends. It's a very lively crowd and it's a fun atmosphere. We came on a Wednesday night and it was in full swing so shows it's Always a good time."}
{"text":"this place is alot of fun, unlike your run of the mill bar. there is a bull that you can ride and see how long you can stay on for. there is a group dance they do at the front with other little fun things thru the night, the seats by the bar are saddles (uncomfortable but super cool) its one of the only bars in toronto where u can be in a cowboy outfit and fit RIGHT in, super cool, lots of fun and always aliot of groups of people having birthday parties or bachelorette party there.

free to get in before 9 pm 
10$ after 9 ** unless your on guest list so if you know your going get on that list !!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Good old style country bar in Toronto 
I been here twice now and I enjoy my time. 
It's always pretty busy after 10. The crowd is ranging anywhere from 19-50/60 year olds ( just a few) mainly younger 20's 

Anyway I consider their main attraction the bull riding which is free and usually a 2 minute line 
Just have to sign a waiver before you go on, and it's pretty fun. 

The bar service and servers isn't all that great probably because they are busy but I also noticed so many employees walking around not doing much or enjoying themselves. 
The part I hate about this place is the drinks, they cheap out on the booze and under pour. I had the margarita and bloody ceaser and both had little to no alcohol in them. The both look nice and are presented really well. The shots are expensive and are served in little see through plastic shot glasses you can get from the dollar store. 
I was so disappointed about the drinks! 

Food: 
Nachos wee really really good 
I dont know why they had to put the sour cream guacamole and salas right on top I had a friend that is allergic to guacamole so they had to eat around it. 
Onions rings (no picture) were also very good nice and crispy and fresh 

Pre drink if you plan on coming here or stick to beer otherwise you are wasting your money"}
{"text":"If I could give this bar 0 stars I would. My boyfriend and I tucked into this place since we were a bit early to a show we were seeing at Adelaide Hall later on that evening. We walked in and the place was not busy at all (a couple occupied booths and a few people scattered along the bar). We took a seat and 3 people behind the bar saw us take our coats off and sit down. Once we sat down all 3 proceeded to continuously walk by us multiple times and even with one saying hi to us and then walking away quickly. Each time they walked by we attempted to get their attention, each time them turning their backs to us or simply walking the alternate direction. After 15 minutes of not being served or paid any attention to I got up and made my way to the other end of the bar and alerted the bartenders that in case they hadn't seen us we were waiting for the last 15 minutes and asked whether or not I had to grab a booth in order to be served or if they simply were currently taking bar orders... He looked stunned and immediately made his way to the bar and said the drinks were on him. I believe that if I had not said anything or stood up for myself they would have never served us. (As an aside, in all my years of making my rounds throughout the bar scene I have never encountered this. Usually after taking a seat at the bar (especially when the place is far from busy) the bartender will immediately make himself available and keep checking up on you). A few minutes after we got our drinks a lady came to sit next to us at the bar and proceeded to get served even before she finished getting entirely settled. Of course I am unimpressed but glad that someone else didn't have to go through what we just did. However, after we finished our drinks, who I'm assuming is the owner of the place was speaking with a group of men who were huddled at the bar, the lady next to us was trying to get his attention as she wanted another drink. He made his way over to her and proceeded to approach her in an extremely rude manor... I was shocked as to how someone who is meant to represent this establishment could treat a paying customer that way... At this point we had finished our drinks and were ready to leave when we were interrupted by the owner asking if we wanted some free shots... I looked at the owner strangely as I was caught off guard since we had never spoken to him / I was unimpressed with the entire evening altogether. He proceeded to ask me in a rather demeaning manner \"why [I] was looking at him as if [he] was offering [me] drugs\"... At this point I just wanted to leave even quicker than anticipated. Not only was the way in which he approached me extremely unprofessional and extremely crude but also the fact that he kept insisting on giving free drinks was strange and sketchy... Throughout my times of frequenting the downtown bar scene I have never experienced that kind of behaviour... Needless to say I made an immediate exit and will never be caught within a 100 foot radius of that establishment. Rude (or no) service all around and just a weirdly, strange atmosphere. Did not make me feel comfortable and felt very demeaned and talked down to. I was willing to even get a couple drinks had I not been treated so awfully and felt so disgusted with the entire experience and place. Will never go here again and would not recommend as no one deserves to be treated that way!"}
{"text":"I was here for a birthday. There was a large group of us and we did the Party Package. For $35 you get a drink, an app, a main, and either a dessert or a shot. Plus line dances. Plus you're there before cover and you get complimentary coat check.

Now, this sounds like a great deal. And it is. But the food? That's not worthwhile. If you're starving, you won't care. But if you're going to enjoy your meal... you've been warned that it's mediocre at best!

The nice part is, when you're there for dinner, there's hardly any others, and you can try staying atop the mechanical bull as many times as you want. The other part of the package is complimentary line dancing tutorials. Line dancing sounds cool in theory. For a one night deal. But a bar/club that only does country... well, they are loyal to their brand! Country is not a style you can dance to easily.

It was fun, for the night. The mechanical bull was great. The service was friendly. But this is not the type of place you return to unless you REALLY love country."}
{"text":"Celebrating our friends 30th! Great atmosphere: line dancing, bull-riding and cold beers.   Bison burger was excellent."}
{"text":"Came for a bachelor party. Waited outside to get in even though we had a reservation. Waited a long time before a server showed up at our table. It was only 9 pm and not very crowded yet. Ordered drinks that took too long. Ordered food 90 minutes ago and still waiting at 11 pm. Service sucks. Don't come here unless you don't want drinks or food."}
{"text":"The table service was terrible - our waitress only served us one drink in the 4 hours we were there.  Most of us elected to open a tab at the bar where they were much happier to serve us.

Food is mediocre, you'd be better off going around the corner to burrito boys.

Washrooms were disgusting - only 3 stalls for the ladies.  By 11 pm one toilet was clogged and the other two were covered in vomit.

Watched a couple of girls throw up in front of the waitress and then not get kicked out.  So if that's your thing, this is the bar for you!"}
{"text":"We came here when they were hosting the Brad Paisley pre-party back in August so it was busier than expected on Thursday at 6 PM, but still not that busy as we were able to get seats at the bar. The bartenders are attentive enough (with some being more so than others) and the drinks are made pretty fast. The prices are quite standard with the margarita pails being a lot more, but they were delicious and came in colourful pails so I'll make an exception. However, our order of fried pickles took super long, like an upwards wait of 20 minutes. I had to ask the bartender about it before she checked up on it and brought it over.

Bonus: they also had extra VIP tickets with party bus transportation to and from the bar and offered them to us as we were still there when everyone vacated but a whole night of country music just wasn't my thing, so we declined. Don't ask why we went to that bar lol. If you asked me what free thing I would decline, I would usually say none but that would be it! Overall, decent bar with average prices and nice staff. I would return if I was a fan of country music, but that I am not (I was there because I had to be!)."}
{"text":"Last night, myself and ten others visited this establishment to celebrate a birthday. For the most part, we had a great time; however, when I asked for my bill, the waitress assumed I was paying for the whole table. I explained to her, that I only wanted to pay for myself. Her response was, \"I can't do that!\" I asked for a manger, which she than pretended to go talk to one. She returned in a sour mood, and and said she could charge me separately. While she was charging me for what I ate, she decided to include a 17 per cent service fee which I found disrespectful as I did not want to tip her at all for her rude service. I then got into a bit of argument with her for the service and told her to charge exactly what I owed for the dinner and nothing more. In my opinion, if you decide to dine here watch-out for shady practices and service charges, also if the waiter asks to take your card card refuse keep an eye on it at all times."}
{"text":"My friend decided to have their birthday here. After looking at reviews, I didn't really have much expectations. However, while it wasn't great, it's not that bad either.

We had a big group of around 15 people and despite my friend emailing them in advance, they did not have her reservation noted. It was a good thing we came early, about 8pm, so there was still a few empty tables. They told us it's free cover and free coat check before 8:30pm but on flyers it says before 9:30. So it's best to double check before you decide to go. Coat check is $3 usually. Idk about cover. 

Also, since she booked a birthday reservation, apparently we were suppose to get cowboy hats or at least the birthday girl was? No one gave that to us, I had to go to coat check to ask for my friend. 

Our server was nice, she came out with a better cowgirl hat later on that night. However, she initially forgot to take orders for myself and another friend in the party. Kinda surprising how she could miss us, since we were sitting right next to the bday girl. It wasn't even that busy then. 

Warning: The menu on the website and what we saw once there was vastly different! The menu they have there is extremely limited compared to what's online. For food, I ordered the BBQ chicken wings 1 pound for $11. It was okay but I can get better at St.Louis with a beer! Don't even have honey garlic flavour! Only BBQ and Frank's. For drinks, we had 2 pitchers w/ the most popular drink being the Bulldog ($15). It was pretty good, you get your drink in a bucket! 

Main attraction for us was the mechanical bull. I tried that thing twice and walked away with a bruise on my leg. Lol. Still, it's quite fun. They require you to show ID to ride this, and sign a consent form. They might also take a quick surprise picture of you as you finish the process. No idea what happened to the photo they took of me. Lol. After you finish form process, you also get a wristlet with \"I braved the bull\" on it. This is so you don't have to show your ID again on any future attempts. Saves time. Also, by the bar..some of the stools had saddles on them, which was kinda cool.

Overall, good if you want to go for the theme/novelty of it and grab a drink in a bucket. But for food and customer service, they need to step it up."}
{"text":"They ran out of beer cups..... drank out of plastic cups. They ran out of fries......LOL
They ran out of chicken....
I paid cover for this.....

Y'all suck."}
{"text":"I came here a few weeks ago for a friend's birthday and we had a great time. There was a group of about 10 of us, and we had tried to get in a few weeks earlier around 10:15 at night and the line was ridiculous! As we were keen to go to Rock n Horses, we decided to make a reservation for dinner for my friend's celebration. The reservation was for 6:30, and we were told that we would need to finish our meals by 9 because they would need to move our table off of the dance floor since we were a big group. Rock n Horses certainly isn't busy early on in the night, but there are some definite advantages to arriving early:

1) Free coat check (I believe before 9)
2) No cover
3) Guaranteed entry - no need to wait in slow moving lines!
4) $15 bottles of wine on Fridays between 5 and 7 (warning: this is not good quality wine!)

The food is pretty good and presented well for a bar. However we were a bit disappointed to hear that they were already out of corn on the cob when we placed our orders at 7. 

I had the garlic prawns ($12 - white wine, chilli garlic butter, grilled bread) without the butter. I also made a last minute adjustment to my meal and asked to have a side salad instead of the grilled bread. The waitress was great and rushed to see if they could accommodate my request. Although this dish is listed as a starter, it could easily be a main as it comes with plenty of shrimp! The shrimp arrive in a small cast iron skillet on top of a wooden board and the salad came in a bowl to the side. The shrimp were well cooked and very flavourful, and the salad really exceeded my expectations! There were fresh mixed greens along with large pieces of fresh carrots, blanched green beans, cucumbers, and other quality vegetable toppings.

Our server was great and easily managed our group and our complicated orders. The establishment also allowed us to bring in our own cupcakes for our friend's birthday; however, given the theme of the venue I was expecting a bit more in terms of 'presentation' when we asked for the cupcakes - a song or something would have been nice! One hiccough with the service was that we did not receive separate bills. Our server was able to ring us through on separate credit cards though.

The rest of the evening was pretty fun with a number of group members getting up for a ride on the mechanical bull! The music was your typical country tunes, with staff members providing line dancing 'lessons' early on in the evening. I didn't find that the venue ever got particularly busy or crowded, so there was never a long wait to be served at the bar. But with only three stalls in the ladies washroom, there was quite a line to get in.

Definitely a fun night in the end, but I'm not sure if this is a place I would go to regularly."}
{"text":"Actually the worst bar and  management in Toronto. The bouncers let a group of black out girls, by pass the line, who were slurring their words and puking in the alley way. And when I commented, a bouncer told me to \"shut the Fuck up. Quit my bitching, or leave.\". Once inside, the line for a drink was ridiculous and the cup they gave me had lipstick all over it. When I asked for a new cup the bartender rolled her eyes, waved over a bouncer and told him I was cut off. GREAT PLACE. hope it gets shut down."}
{"text":"Drinks-great!
Atmosphere-pretty live after 11pm
Music-for a country fan: fantastic!
Food-Better luck elsewhere
I would say that if you want a casual place for drinks and to enjoy some classic country music, this is the place for you. The mechanical bull was also quite free if you go earlier in the evening and tons of fun! 
The line dancing added more fun to the evening and I definitely enjoyed my visit late into the night. I appreciated the large crowd who all shared in the joy of country! Will definitely return. 
Tip:eat before or after at places nearby as the food isn't very great."}
{"text":"Before I start I want to begin saying that the customer service in this place is terrible. Pure snobs.. like if you don't want to be here, find a new job. I'm guessing the only reason these employees work here is cause they don't have the intellect or personality to work anywhere else with better standards.

anyways..

When you first arrive you notice the high long stairs you must walk up to get to a place filled with loud country music (not a fan). because I was with a group of people it was not all bad. Food was mediocre. I wouldn't come again to pay out of my own pocket. The food did not have enough seasoning on anything. The alcohol - it feels like when I went to a different bartender for a mixed drink, one would pour more alcohol than the other.

There were line dancing and bull riding. The bull riding was cool but I think I was too wasted at the time and only lasted 4 seconds lol.

Would I come here again?

 - If it was paid for and I had to show up then yes."}
{"text":"I went here with a group of 12 or so friends to celebrate a birthday. My friend loves country music, so this was a great surprise for him.

The service was great, starting with making the reservations, they informed me of different options and activites (bull riding and line dancing). Our waitress was excellent, making the effort to remember all our names and keep our bills separate. She came around to check on us more than enough too. 

We had a lot of fun line dancing (and just dancing in general) and riding the mechanical bull was so much fun. It's free, but make sure you have I'd because you need to show it to sign the waiver. I went on it 6 times! I don't know any other bars with rides!! 

The menu is okay, but the food was quite good, nothing outstanding. The beer was pretty expensive though (like 8 dollars for a tall can of domestic). 

Overall, great service, great atmosphere, great times! This won't be a regular bar for me, but for this occasion, it couldn't have been better."}
{"text":"If you want to watch a sporting event I highly recommend this bar. The food is your classic pub food, its high in fat and full of carbs. I can't lie I do like that type of food but you have to treat yourself here once every couple of months. The service is good and if you do really want to ride that bull....this is where you have to go!"}
{"text":"I am only reviewing the food and i am giving it two stars. 
We ordered bucket of fried chicken to share. It came with a small piece of corn bread and coleslaw. It was horrible. The skin was burnt and chicken was dry. Definitely not worth the $32. Now i wish i got a burger for $14.

ENTERTAINMENT.. 5 STARS!
Atmosphere is great and service is great."}
{"text":"I had an awesome time at that bar! 

I don't normally write about dance bars or clubs cause who reads em anyway. If you're friends wanna go, you'll probably go. But I figured it was worth sharing my two cents because I actually had an awesome time here last Saturday. Music was on point! Drinks weren't too badly priced either considering. Just note its a bit of a younger crowd but still fun none the less!"}
{"text":"So excited that being a fan of country is now an accepted, nay, celebrated thing in the city.  Came here the Friday after opening weekend with a likeminded country-fan pal for dinner, then to line dance into the wee hours. Arrived around 7:45-8pm. At this time, coat check is free and we had no problem getting a table for dinner. However I think the staff are still learning - the bar was packed and well-staffed, however there was no one to seat us at a booth, and after 15 minutes of waiting with clearly no one noticing we were there (even though the booth next to us was being served), we had to go to the bar to ask for a server. However, once she arrived she apologied profusely and gave us great service the rest of the night, so full stars and an ample tip returned on that one.

The food was decent and they make a mean margarita (traditional and fruity flavours available, blended or shaken). At $14.75 a pop, the margs are big and have a good booze/lime/ice balance. I opted for the Bulldog (a marg with an upside-down Corona) because it was the same price as a regular marg. Always go big when you got the option, right?  

At about 10pm, the server will come to wrap up your tab whether you're ready or not. Apparently they like to settle up before it gets busy, which is totally understandable. What'smore, at this point you shouldn't still be sitting. It's time to line dance and get on that Toro.  The 'official' line dancing lessons took place in the early hours around 9pm when the dancefloor was empty, however there are unofficial lessons with the cute sheriff/security guy in the boots and hat, who gets on the dancefloor and line dances to 3 or 4 songs every hour or so. Keep your eye out for him and try to get as close as possible to learn the steps before everyone on the dancefloor catches on and joins in.  Too many boots and your view will be blocked. That, and you will be crashing into a lot of innocent bystanders not in on the fun. 

The bull is FREE the whole month of December.  Not sure what they will charge in the new year, but consider you will only last 20-30 seconds, price that out accordingly. The line gets longer the later you wait in the night, and at all times there will be a crowd watching you, so don't think you can find that sweet spot when it's just you and the bull. There seem to be 2 settings - the girl version (slower, but more full stops, which I personally think is more difficult) and the guy version, which is faster and more fluid.  It was a complete blast and everyone cheers you on, friends and stranger alike.  Being 5'4\", I did need a boost from the operator, which was probably the most embarassing part of the whole experience.

Lastly, I will say the crowd is very young.  A lot of college kids, girls puking in the bathroom at 12am, slooty dancing everywhere. It gets very unapologetically pushy, a lot of overly drunk people who spat curses at us when we said \"you don't have to push\" like the uppity adults we've become. It would have been a different scene if it were an older crowd, I would have liked to see this bar on Ossington. That said, if you squint your eyes and have another bourbon, you just about start to feel like you're in a real country joint, south of the Mason-Dixon."}
{"text":"This is a great bar and is loads of fun, but the staff here need to lighten up a bit. 

I understand they need to keep things under control but my friend and I were clearly NOT wasted. The first time my friend couldn't find her sunglasses and was looking around on the floor to find them and was kicked out because they thought she was drunk, when she tried to explain her situation the security didn't care and made her leave...come to find out later one of them had her sunglasses the whole time. The second time my friend and I were waiting to ride the mechanical bull and once I had finished my turn I said to my friend I wanted to ride again and the operator turned to me and said \"NO YOU'RE TOO DRUNK\"...I can assure you I was only tipsy at the time I had even asked my friend if I appeared too drunk and she said no. I was really offended by this and it kind of put a negative feeling on my night out."}
{"text":"This place is super snazzy. It's upstairs and coat Check is available for a fee I think. 

The food is mostly finger food that are shareable or the option of $35 for the packaged deal. Bull riding and pool is FREE! As long as you sign a waiver form. 

The staff are mad friendly and they dress up in the cow boy/girl gear. So wear plaid and boots to blend in. Oh, they also teach you how to line dance so that when your plastered, you know the moves already and can join or at least attempt to anyways. 

All around a positive experience."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a fun night out, I would definitely recommend Rock N Horse. I went for my birthday and had a blast. Great atmosphere and music! The bull riding is also super fun! 

They have giant margaritas in sand pails for $10, which are delicious! 

On Saturdays there is free cover before 9:30, so I'd advise getting there early as it gets packed fast."}
{"text":"I was in town for a few days and love to go linedancing and was thrilled to find this place was within walking distance of the hotel. It looked like Boots N Bourbon would have been a better choice, but it would have required a taxi ride. I regret not paying for a taxi and skipping Rock N Horse...

It took multiple messages to finally get an answer of \"yes the had linedancing lessons, and they happened after 7pm on Thursday and Friday nights.\" I showed up around 7pm, went to the bar for a drink, and joined in a couple linedances that I knew the choreography to. I was surprised when the staff left the dance floor promptly after, but I found a table and finished my drink. 45 minutes later I get up and ask a waitress (because none would stop at my table to get me a new drink or food) if there were linedancing lessons, she said there weren't lessons but they do some dancing at the top of every hour. So I go to the bar and get another drink and go back to my table. 8pm rolls around and I'm excited to linedance again, sadly, it never started up again. 8:20pm and I get up and ask a waitress if there's linedancing that night and she said in the next 5-15 minutes. A waiter who's standing near says he'll see if he can get it started again. I wait another 2 songs then leave. What I was hoping would be a fun night out linedancing turned out to be me getting a couple drinks at a bar and no dinner and 2 songs of dancing, and waiting around for almost an hour and a half."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a place that plays  real country music, a mechanical bull, and a place where you can be a cowboy or a cowgirl for a night, then this place is for you. Ok its $15.00 to get in, but the atmosphere and crowd are fun here. Good selection of beers and typical bar drinks. A great place to come with a group of friends!"}
{"text":"I honestly can't get over how awesome this place it! My throat is still burning today from all the screaming out the lyrics I did last night.

I'm a big country music fan and I'd never thought I'd see something as awesome as Rock N Horse in Toronto.

Spent Friday night there. Arrived at around 9pm. It's still quiet-ish at this time and you can order food. At around 10pm they clear out a lot of the tables and remove the saddle-bar stools to make more room. That place gets PACKED. 

Surprisingly there was a good mix of die-hard country music fans and people who were just there for the experience. The mechanical bull at the back is heaps of fun, and the DJ spins mostly new country hits with a splash of the old favourites.

I haven't had so much fun since I was in my early 20s. Crowd was mixed ages, some 20 somethings, 30 somethings and just a dash of the 40+.

In the course of the night I had a drunk guy buy me 7 bottles of Coors Light in the span of 30 mins (no, I didn't drink them all), a guy in a santa suit continually touching my bum with his prosthetic arm and met a gaggle of American men posing as Detroit Red Wings.

Arrive early or get on the guest list if possible.

Good coat check. Only slight moan is the bathrooms - the set up of the ladies room is such that it's hard to queue/line up to wait for a stall, and drunk women who need to pee can get really b!tchy!"}
{"text":"The Rock 'n Horse is a little slice of the country in the heart of downtown. Yes, you will get a chance to do line dancing here. The staff is nice and enthusiastic when serving drinks or teaching you the dance moves.

But I have some complaints. The drinks were expensive. The food was not great. Plus, the place is very loud.  Worst of all, despite the fact that we were a large group (20 people) who gave the place nice business (we had dinner and drinks), we were only able to reserve our table for a limited time and then were asked to vacate and move to the bar. At this point we moseyed on to another watering hole more deserving of our business. In the words of country star Sunny Sweeney \"Staying's Worse Than Leaving\"."}
{"text":"We visited from the states and were out boozing, we stumbled across this beauty. The staff was pleasant at the door. Might have feel in love with the bar tenders there. Very polite, energetic, and of course blonde bombshells in daisy dukes. This place had about 4 girls to every dude. I came with my girl but wish I hadn't ;) the roof top view is spectacular and a must see."}
{"text":"Not a place for edible food. Unless you are intoxicated enough to overlook the raw or expertly, extremely well-done chicken - a story for another time so, I can keep this review quick. Pricey food. 
The drinks seemed ok...
Fortunately, I didn't stay long enough to experience anything else."}
{"text":"I attended an awesome launch party for this newly opened saloon. There was line dancing, Spurlesque dancing (yes exotic line dancing) mechanical bull riding, and an  
enthusiastic margarita menu that features lime, mango, strawberry or raspberry. Perhaps the drink of the night for the brave cowgirls and cowboys was The Bulldog, a GIANT margarita topped with an upside-down bottle of Corona."}
{"text":"So I am not a fan of country music but I am a fan of Rock n' Horse.  It has a very fun vibe that isn't hurt by the free bull rides.  People are very serious about their line dancing so we generally vacate the floor when the line dancing begins.   That said, it is relaxed and everyone there is out to have fun.  Its a good place to mix it up."}
{"text":"Can't speak to the food. I came here for the country music and the bull on a Saturday night, and had a BLAST! My friends and I usually don't listen to country but went with an open mind because this place is jokes. Cover was $14 and coat check was $3. Apparently on Friday ladies are free before 11. 

I thought this place was only going to be 19 year olds, but was surprised to find a mid 20s crowd. The atmosphere is what you'd expect for a country bar, I felt like I was in Calgary for Stampede. People wore their cowboy hats and a lot of plaid! 

Riding the bull was really fun. You sign a waiver, get a wristband, and wait in line. The line was about 5 minutes. The area beside and around the bull is heavily padded/safe. I highly recommend trying it for fun!"}
{"text":"Very fun place to go, drink, dance and maybe ride a mechanical bull.  The atmosphere is very chill, people are having a great time and staff are super friendly.  I have been there now twice, once for a birthday party and other time last minute night with girlfriends.  Definetly check it out. I haven't worked up the courage to ride the mechanical bull however fun to watch."}
