{"text":"Tonight we visited this restaurant and was amazed how fantastic the food was. The kebab was fantastic the shawarma was great and the rice dish which was like a biryani but with raisen just amazing. Even the bread was fresh and tasty. I am a big fan and would most certainly visit this fantastic restaurant. Highly recommend in terms of price and value for the money."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely delicious, they put a lot of work into the preparation of the meal. Super nice persons as well. If we don't have time to go in skip the dishes is a great option.
Such a nice change from pizza and burgers."}
{"text":"Hot, fresh, delicious!
The staff is very friendly and personable!
Food portions are BIG, so skip a meal beforehand!"}
{"text":"The food was well seasoned, decent portions at a great value. Comparable to some of the places downtown Toronto, highly recommended if you are in the Durham area."}
{"text":"Listen: when I tell you this is my go to restaurant for Ajax it is NO LIE! The cooks and staff always are the first to ask you how you want your food cooked, and they really care about their quality! I've been going for years and not once has the quality diminished! The best thing to order from them in my personal opinion is the Sultani kabob combo if you are a beef lover-the meat is tender and juicy and delicious! Their naan is always freshly made fluffy pillows of dough, and it might be weird to say that the salad is my favorite part of the combo, but they put so much effort into constructing every part of their dishes that you can tell they go the extra mile for the food to be just that more extra delicious! When it comes to deciding between this location and the competing kabob place off Brock, we still come here and have never been dissapointed! The staff is super friendly and accommodating and a very supportive family restaurant. They are really good for catering events too! Other notable things to order is the Tikka (any meat!) And kofta kabob you order from here! You won't be let down! Have not tried their shwarma so far but kabobs are still the item to come here for!"}
