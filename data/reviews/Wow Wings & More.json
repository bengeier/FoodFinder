{"text":"I travel a lot for business and stumbled across this gem in Whitby.  The girls behind the bar are super cute and friendly.  The regulars occupying the adjacent bar stools are engaging and entertaining.  Wings and fries were fantastic. I highly recommend the fries with three cheese ranch, diced purple onions, and hot peppers.  This should be your go to place for wings, fries, beers, and good conversation when in Whitby!!"}
{"text":"Wow Wings is our family's favourite wing restaurant. They have an amazing variety of wings. The reason that we like the wings so much is because they are always hot and crispy! For takeout, they even clip the styrofoam container so that moisture doesn't build up inside and make the wings soggy ... and it works!  Our Favourites: Spicy Cajun, Mexican, Garlic Explosion, Kansas City Jerk, Taco Bull, Devil's Ranch (hot), Chili & Onion (really hot), Spicy Tandoori, Forty Creek BBQ  Worth a Try: Cayenne, Hickory & Bacon, Texas Homicide, Bubba's Butt Blaster Spicy Masala, Butter Masala, Texas Hot, Taj Mahal (hot), Lanka's Jerk (hot), Smoky Tequila Lime  Avoid: Dry Jerk, Garlic Cajun, Dill Pickle, Peppercorn Ranch, Phuket Island"}
{"text":"Though the wings are really good, atmosphere is nice, and staff is friendly, the prices have just crept too high to keep going back. Wing night is now 89¢/wing, which isn't really a deal at all."}
{"text":"Great selection of flavours! We ordered the platter of 50 wings for my table of 4 to share (came to about $1 per wing). We also ordered two sides which were amazinggg, arguably better than the wings themselves - Garlic parm fries and jalapeño poppers.   You get to choose 10 flavours with the 50 wing platter. Below are the flavours we chose, ranked from personal favourites to least favourites: Hot blonde Forty creek  Honey garlic  Garlic Parmesan  Hot honey  Buffalo honey American  Korean  Taco bull Smokey dill   An area for improvement for this restaurant would be the menu. The wing flavours are so cryptic, with absolutely no description to explain the ingredients in each of the sauces. This caused us to order blindly for some flavours. For example, \"Ocean Mist\" was a wing flavour. What the heck does that taste like? Is it seafood? No way of knowing unless you ask. But there are so many flavours it would be very time consuming to have to ask about each one."}
{"text":"I googled best wings in Durham and Wow Wings Whitby appeared. The best wings we have ever had and we have tried them everywhere in search of the perfect wing. They were large and breaded with 123 sauce selections. Service was fantastic. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"The wings and flavours here are definitely adequate so long as you can actually manage to get your hands on some. I came in with my girlfriend this past week for the hockey game and the all-you-can-eat special. We received our first order and drinks in a relatively timely manner, but then we're forced to wait 30 minutes before being approached again. It wasn't for a lack of staff either, as there were at least 4 waitresses and the owner walking around. After trying to waive down an employee for almost a half hour, we grew fed up, settled and left. After explaining to the owner that we had been waiting this long, he didn't offer so much as an apology to us and made us feel contemptuous for even mentioning it. That being said, I can easily find a place with comparable wings that will actually provide a decent level of service. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"best wing place i've found in Whitby so far."}
{"text":"This continues to be our go-to joint for wings. We don't get the lovers combo anymore because the salad is nothing to write home about and we really just want the wings!!  We now get one of the combos that allows us to get 5 different flavours of wings. We haven't found any that are as good as our usuals, bumble bbq, thai domi and gar par but we always try something new. We also always get an order of onion petals, they're SOOOOO good and a great addition to a messy plate of wings.   We always call ahead and it usually takes about 20 minutes for everything to be ready."}
{"text":"Best wings PERIOD!  Yes price has gone up over the last few years - but still worth every penny. Good solid wings, lots of meat on the bone.   Fav: Honey Jerk, Hot Honey, Tandoori rub"}
{"text":"Good food and great pricing. We usually get their family meal with fries, wings etc Excellent"}
{"text":"First time coming here with my cousins, as they've come here a couple times before. Came on a Tuesday and wasn't busy at all, so we were able to get a table quickly. Server was very nice and even suggested for us to order the broccoli cheddar poppers! Very good appetizer, super cheesy! I had ordered the spicy garlic parm, and it was delicious, but very spicy. Unfortunately, the server seemed to always be hard to reach, or if we asked for something, it would take another 20-30 minutes to get. For example, asked for an apple juice for my goddaughter and didn't receive it until 20 minutes later (mind you, it wasn't busy at all!) Overall, the wings are good and very delicious, but service needs to improve."}
