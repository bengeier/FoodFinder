{"text":"It had been a while since I've lived in the Scarborough/North York areas, but I'd say this is the best dim sum place I've found in these areas thus far.  We were introduced to this restaurant by a family friend who's quite the gourmet, so that already gives it some credibility.  That dinner we had was one of those multi-course deals.  It's been a while, but I remember every dish being very good, especially the giant lobster that we shared.  Not only was its sheer size a sight to behold, but the taste was also excellent.  My family and I looked up this place again for dim sum and it also impressed us.  The one flaw was that we ordered pork knuckles with ginger and vinegar (???) and they were sold out, but the waitress was sharp enough to come back immediately to tell us of the fact, so there was no idle waiting.  The pork dumplings (??) were a bit on the hard side, but the pieces were huge.  The shrimp dumplings (??) were big with fresh shrimp, the beef tendons  (??) were flavourful, and the phoenix talons (??) were some of the best I've had in the Toronto area.  And their morning discounts are substantial, bringing the price of non-special dishes down to around $3 each.  I will be returning to this place for the foreseeable future."}
{"text":"Dim Sum have so many variety and taste is so yummy.  They are have the traditional style Dim Sum Cart to sell the dim sum.  Worth to take a try and you will like it a lot!!"}
{"text":"I go here almost every weekend for the early tea special (Small, Medium, and Large dim sum is $3.00, all other sizes and orders are NOT included in the special). The place is always packed during this time and I recommend coming before 10am (closer to 9am) to get a table if you want to take advantage of the special.  The dim sum is pretty good and the tea is decent. The main reasons why I always return is that the portions are large compared to many other places and they have a wide selection of dishes. Food comes out fast (5 - 10 minutes) and everything is hot and fresh from the kitchen. Service is mostly attentive to refill tea pots and clear dishes from the table.  I've also been here many times for their banquets and regular menu dinner. Dishes were also pretty good and generous in size.  Overall, the place is good but not amazing. I've been going here for over 10 years and, compared to similar restaurants, the food is definitely worth the price."}
{"text":"took my mom in law for a birthday dinner, her choice of restaurant. very disappointed to see shark fin on the menu given what we know about their rapid decline in numbers and the cruel act of cutting off the fins and tossing the living being back into the water to drown."}
{"text":"Large, spacious restaurant with a few different from other dim sum restaurants including, clams, scallops, snails and tofu dessert.  Many of the staff don't speak English though so having a Chinese speaking person would help!"}
{"text":"My family drives from Etobicoke to get my Grandma and go to this place almost every Saturday :) Great deal, especially if you go early, because they have cheaper prices before 11am. The Chai Siu Bow is so good at this place that we just take extras from dim sum instead of buying some at the pastry places. I have been to Hong Kong's Michelin star dimsum place and there was only one dish there that I liked more than here at Very Fair. The dimsum in Toronto is literally world class, and Very Fair is leading the pack."}
{"text":"Traditional Chinese push cart dim sum in Scarborough!  You won't find many of these places anymore since they typically opt for paper and pencil so that they don't need servers running around with carts.  If you make it before 11am, you get a bit of a discount on the price.  The food is tasty, quick and like most push cart places, is a bit of a zoo if there is a cart with items that people want (rice).  Do come early because it fills up pretty quick and the line up after is always pretty bad from what I see.  Place is decorated decently, probably doubles as a banquet hall for weddings in the evenings.  Service is okay after you are seated (you get to ask for a tea, they drop your utensils and they disappear until needed), before seats we have no issues, but we always come at 9:30am before the rush.  I would return (actually come by roughly once a month)."}
{"text":"What a corrupt seating system. Came here for dim sum on Chinese new year and the restaurant was packed. While waiting, I noticed the only way to get a seat is to know someone who works at the restaurant or bribe the hostess. Taking a number means nothing at this restaurant because numbers never get called. Decided to leave after waiting almost two hours and complaining multiple times. Definitely will not be returning."}
{"text":"Bad service. Party of 5, brought us to a table with 3 chairs and just walked off. We had to solicit chairs from other tables ourselves. They just don't give a damn. The women pushing the carts won't tell you what they have unless you ask. Some try to force you to take the last of whatever they have. It's stressful.  Taste of the food is all over the place. Mostly it's average.  Not a good way to spend a Sunday."}
{"text":"Call me old fashioned but I'm a sucker for push cart dim sum, so VFSR gets a star for that. The food is good with lots of variety and great if you can get in before 11am. The decor reminds me of a banquet hall with chandeliers.  Will return for Dim Sum and will have to try their dinner menu."}
{"text":"We got here late in the morning so did not get to try the half price deal which we only heard about.  On this Thursday morning, the place was packed with mostly Chinese speaking customers, but we got seated within 5 minutes.  The dinning room looked more like a banquet room, and we were impressed with everything--the crowd, d√©cor, stage, etc...  I felt like I was at a banquet hall and not at a restaurant.  We quickly ordered our food (mostly dim sum dishes), and they all came out in no time.  It's like they concentrated to get done with one table then move on to the next.  This was  our first time visiting Toronto, and I started to believe that it was going to be hard not to be impressed by these establishment.  The food was great, the service was quick, and the atmosphere was fantastic.  I guess it helped that we sat right next to the server station so we had no problem to get their attention.  5% service charge was automatically added to the bill.  NO, it's not a typo.  They only charged 5% service charge.  We definitely drop in again next time we visit Toronto.  Most Chinese restaurants in Toronto only accept cash so ask first before you sit down.  Also, if you don't speak Chinese, you will be at a disadvantage for sure.  So, be aggressive and take charge like waving down a server and get their attention.  If you just wait to be served at these establishment, you will be waiting for a long time."}
{"text":"Frustrating wait with table assignment system. Needed to make a loud scene to get a table.  I took my family of 4 to this restaurant on Mother's Day, just before noon. The line up outside was not long. The receptionist told my wife that it would be a 10-15 minute wait. We were assigned a number 102 when they were serving numbers in the 80's.  We thought that was a reasonable wait. After 20 minutes they were calling numbers past ours. When we inquired, the receptionist said these were for large tables. There were still 3 others before us waiting for table of 4 or less. We inquired several times after that and was given the same answer.  After 1 hour, they were calling numbers in the 140's. There were still 3 others for table of 4 ahead of us. One customer after us for table of 4 started to complain about the long wait and they were given a big table as long as they were willing to share the table. They did not land up sharing. After 1 hour and 20 minutes, they were calling numbers in the 150's. I started to complain to the receptionist and she just ignored me. Another customer waiting started to complain loudly in Mandarin until management came to investigate. When I joined in the complaint, it got pretty loud. To keep us quiet, they gave us a table which was set up for 6.  I am sure that if we did not complain, we would not have got a table until past 2:00 PM.   The restaurant was set up for sitting larger group for Mother's Day. Tables normally for 4 were squeezed in for 6. Therefore there were very few tables for 4 or less. That was just greedy. Looks like at this restaurant, you have to complain loudly just to get fairly treated. I would not recommend a family of 4 to go to this restaurant. They are just not interested in your business."}
{"text":"Food is quite good but the service was meh. Food came out very slowly and the waiters/waitresses were not attentive. However, the sitting arrangement was very spacious which was good if you hate the typical crowded dim sum restaurant. Like the name of the restaurant, the overall experience was very fair."}
{"text":"This has been my favorite place to have dim sum in Canada for a long time and I make an effort to visit this restaurant every time I visit. On a Saturday morning, the restaurant was understandably busy, but the wait was fairly quick. The decor was elaborate complete with a multitude of chandeliers and wall lights shaped as candle sticks with crystals dangling from their perch. Heavy purple curtains covered the windows and the chairs were covered with purple velvety fabric. It was hard to keep in mind that this was a Chinese restaurant and we were only here to have some dim sum. We were given a sheet of paper with the menu on it and were prompted to mark the items we wanted. We ordered the shrimp dumpling, steamed pork dumpling(siu mai), steamed glutinous rice w/ chicken, spare ribs w/ black bean sauce, steamed bean curd roll in oyster sauce, braised radish w/ turnip in pepper sauce, beef tripes w/ ginger & onion... etc. it sounds like a lot, but we were seated with a good 6 people. Out of all this food, I would recommend the shrimp dumpling, steamed pork dumpling, and beef tripes. However, this is not to say that everything else was bad, but these items are what I liked the best.  The restaurant was a bit loud with the voices of other customers and the clattering of cups and plates being collected by staffers as customers left. Overall I enjoyed my brunch at this restaurant very much and would definitely come again."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times for dim sum. This place is always full with customers during dim sum/lunch hour. Dim sum is at a discount price if your order is placed before 11am. The food is decent, comes at a good pace. Dim sum 3.5/5, Service 4/5, Atmosphere 3.5/5, overall experience is good at this restaurant. Tip: if you want to come here for the discount dim sum,  be sure to be here before 10 to get a table!"}
{"text":"I came here for a Christmas dinner with my friends family. We were a group of 12 and ordered a set menu, drinks were done BYOB. My gracious host ordered a 15 course meal/set menu and we waited the arrival of our food.  First course was a traditional dish consisting of BBQ pork with jelly fish. I don't eat pork but did try the Jelly fish. It was seasoned well as for the pork my fellow diners commented it was a good iteration of this traditional dish. 2nd dish was deep fried crab claws with crab meat (I am a big fan of this dish and was expecting a lot more) the batter was not crisp (no panko) and most of the meat was dried out. A very average take on this classic.  3rd Dish was Scallops with king mushroom and vegetables in clear sauce (I am trying to translate the ethnic names into the explanation I was given so some might seem odd) This was done very well not a hint of grease and showed the skill of the chef as he didn't use any oil to help himself  to get this dish to shine.  Shark Fin soup before everyone pulls out their pitch forks and starts commenting on how unethical this dish is I would like to state I have little appreciation for this dish and could have lived without it but being old school I have try it as not to offend my host full stop!! There were bits of shark fin in this soup but mostly chicken was used to get the volume. I have had much better versions of this soup elsewhere. Chinese Style Beef Steak this is one of my go to dish whenever I go to a traditional Chinese restaurant  and luckily it didn't disappoint. The meat was tender and done close to perfection the sauce was sweet without being overwhelming. A very good take on this dish high recommendations here.  Shitake Mushrooms stuffed with scallops and baby bok choy in oyster sauce. While this dish looked beautiful unfortunately it didn't live up to its presentation.The mushrooms and scallops turned a bit gritty due to over cooking. Bok Choy and oyster  sauce were good though. Dynamite Oysters were flambe'd and served nice and warm. Initial taste was very good as there was very little hint of oil even though it was deep fried. I was expecting a kick given I could see all the hot pepper seeds. I would recommend eating this dish hot as it loses its texture real fast. Next dish was garlic chicken and the skin was nice and crisp however some of the meat was dried out a very average dish. Lobster with Ginger and clear sauce. Its lobster for crying out loud and it hard to screw this up so I enjoyed this dish thoroughly. Good skills shown by the chef again.  Steamed fish with scallions and soy. Carved and served table side. Again a simple dish which is hard to master but this one was done well.  Now came the filler courses (basically shitake mushroom noodles and seafood rice) meh nothing special but I don't expect these to be standouts.    Dessert were a combination of three items one stuffed with black sesame seeds in gooey center (served warm) red bean soup and steamed dumpling with taro centre. I am not a big fan of desserts from this region and they were as expected. All in all a very decent xmas meal and I am grateful to my gracious host for including me in this family meal.  3.5 stars (much better than one can get in downtown)  but if one has come out this far there are better options."}
{"text":"Went here on Friday night for dinner with friends, 5 of us total.  Even at 6 p.m., it neither packed nor dead.  We ended up ordering one of their preset course dinners 1. Soup 2. Peking duck 3. Fish with vegetables 4. Pork neck 5. Cooked oysters 6. Deep-fried shrimp 7. Lettuce wrap 8. Jellyfish  Their Peking duck is always pretty consistent and it's carved right on front of you. All of their dishes were pretty tasty. None were overly salty, oily, or overseasoned.  After the meal, they gave us the red bean soup dessert, sesame cookies, and jelly.  Service was good throughout the whole meal."}
{"text":"Dim Sum review: Morning special ($2.8 per dish before 11am)  This place apparently has been recently renovated. They no longer do the push cart service.   I didn't have high expectations because the prices are low, but it was actually all really good. We tried several items and were very happy with everything.   The morning special (order before 11am, including weekends) is excellent value. All dishes sized S, M & L are only $2.8. The only problem is that it is extremely packed on the weekends. We actually made a reservation for 10am, but still took us about 20min to be seated. I'm guessing the wait without a reservation would have been pretty terrible.   Will definitely return.   Ps. they really should change the English name"}
{"text":"The dim sum food is being pushed around by carts. While it may seem nostalgic, the food suffers by getting cold quickly. The overall quality of the dim sum is perhaps a 6/10.  Honestly there are dim sum foods that is exceptional or even memorable in a positive way but here neither is present. As  for service,  all of the male or female dressed in a black suit or a black jacket (managers) was extremely rude and unhelpful to attempt to solve their customer's issue. The front door hostess on a Saturday lunch was even more unhelpful and lacking common sense.  However, the servers pushing the dim sum carts were outstanding and understanding.  I would not recommend this restaurant if you crave good dim sum and good customer service."}
{"text":"This place was hopping.  We got there at 10.00 am and there was a 45 minute wait.  If you order before 11.00 the price is 40 % cheaper. We  ordered way too much food . There was a large selection. Available. They need to add lazy Susan . They also forgot to give us water. The food was good"}
{"text":"Really good dim sum and seafood restaurant in Scarborough.  We haven`t been here since they renamed the place, and the food is as good as it was before. The dim sum prices are competitive, and the flavour is very good, particularly the seafood dishes. The shrimp in the har gow and rice noodle are nice and large, the green beans were very tasty, the beef tendon was really good and not too sweet, the siu mai are big and juicy, bean curd wrap is really good and not too sweet and sticky. There were a few disappointments, though. They don`t have the carts any more - everything is order of the menu now. Also, the taro cake wasn`t fried enough, and the squid tentacle wasn`t tentacle, it was the body. Still over all the food was very good and we didn`t have to wait too long to get in so I am pretty sure we will be back."}
{"text":"I have dined at Very Fair Seafood Restaurant with mixed experiences.    The usual dinner service is pretty bad.  The servers are not very attentive, they are usually understaffed and the food is mediocre at best.    However, I recently attended a wedding here, and it was a totally different experience.  The food was extremely delicious (albeit a little bit on the salty side) and the serving staff were quite on-the-ball (though I really didn't appreciate them just distributing extras to whomever without getting consent first because there was just no way I could finish the heaps of seconds that kept being dumped on to my plate).  The servers here are probably numb and un-enthused to provide good service because they are always busy.  They cater a lot to the bus loads of post-gambling folk as this plaza serves as a pick up/drop off location to Casino Niagara."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today. We arrived at 11.15am, so we just missed the early bird special. If you put your order in before 11am, S, M and L dim sum is $2.80 per dish. We ordered a small mixed offal congee, steamed soup dumplings, chiu chow dumplings and a minced pork rice roll. The food was ok, the congee wasn't very hot though, considering it was a made to order item. Other dim sum were nice too.  Service was really good, we were greeted by all the servers and the waiters. We didn't need to flag anybody down to refill tea pots. They came as soon as the lid was up.  Nice place to go for lunch but only bad point for me was that the extra menus and special dishes are all in chinese only. Do these places not want customers that can't read chinese? We eat chinese food too! Newly renovated but the carpet is funky and psychedelic looking to me."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of friends for brunch. This place is like a typical restaurant where there's a huge line up on a Sunday, grab a number and wait to be called. At least I didn't see the usual favouritism exhibited by the usual patrons of any given Chinese restaurant.   Now onto the food, we placed our order and the food literally came out 5 mins after we placed our order. The dim sum came out piping hot and fully cooked. Some places that I have been to failed at the latter sometimes. One good thing about this place is I didn't have a very strong after taste from the MSG.   Now onto the restaurant. This place is loud, lively and very busy. One thing that didn't appeal to me was I had to ask one of the staff four times just to get hot sauce... really, four times. So I find the service can be lacking.   Over all experience is just okay. Nothing fancy."}
{"text":"If the measure of a good Chinese restaurant is the line at the door. Then this one shines. Clearly a very popular place. So we know the food will be fresh. But it turns out that because the main hall is so cool and large that by the time most dishes get to us they are not hot.  I highly recommend getting there early because for Sunday dim sum the line starts forming early. If you come at 11 expect to wait am hour.  A very popular dim sum house. When we arrived at 10:25 ther were 35 tables waiting in front of us. 25 minutes later we are half way through the lineup.  In the end it is a decent dim sum experience, certainly reasonably priced and convenient parking and access to shopping in the mall.  I have had better dim sum but clearly the popularity might outweigh my humble rating."}
{"text":"Great service and a great price. Very fair seafood restaurant was more than just fair.   They have a special on Peking duck for only $16.  The large open space made this restaurant really spacious.   I'm not the biggest fan of Chinese food but this joint satisfied my appetite.  Well done."}
{"text":"Never have I witnessed such a corrupt and disorganized restaurant. Came here for dim sum with family and friends on Chinese New Year and naturally there was a long line. But as I waited, I noticed customers who knew the staff, coming in after me, jumping the line and being seated. And even noticed some groups coming in, bribing the hostess, then promptly being given a table. Only after we made several complaints to the hostess did she decide to give us a small table by the door.   Serve customers on a first-come first-serve basis, not through bribes and favoritism. Very Fair? More like Very Disappointed."}
{"text":"We were seated for more than half an hour in with quested our food on three or four occasions Terrible service"}
{"text":"My uncle had his birthday dinner here and we had a very nice banquet menu. Service was very attentive and good. They made all the accommodations for us in terms of the birthday cakes and even packed up all the extra cake that was left over into care packages for us to take home. The restaurant was bustling and very busy on a Sunday evening.   Presentation of food was very good and everything tasted great."}
{"text":"We were just there for a family dinner and found that the service was too quick. The dishes were bland and as for cleanliness the restaurant was sort of ok.  What was a disappointment was that the manager did not wash his hands after using the facilities , then he came to serve the food at our table. This was witnessed by my husband."}
{"text":"My guess is Very Fair gets many of the elder generation Chinese demographic as regulars due to it's strategic LOCATION. It's next to a Chinese Grocery Store and walkable distance to a Medical building, also HSBC. Although there's a huge parking lot shared with other businesses in this plaza, on weekends it can still get quite packed for those family Dim Sum gatherings.   Push Carts are a nice view although even without being stuck in the corner we still didn't get much Cart traffic to our area, fail. They might not have noticed that the younger ones tend to consume more in a shorter period of time, but then the elder ones are more routine visitors.   The Dim Sum is far from pretty but taste was A-OK. There is a bit of visual disturbance as my friend noted some unsightliness on the Dim Sum dishes while I recognized the Dish under my Teacup had some stains.   I found the Push Carts Ladies pretty nice and friendly and please notice that we were surrounded by a 'Cone of Newspaper' as all other tables had either Mingpao or Singtao reading the news and taking time to enjoy their meal rather than rushing. It works here because there's quite a bit of tables on this Weekday morning. If you don't do that stuff, I also noticed a child with a Portable VCD Player."}
{"text":"We got there at 1 on a Holiday Monday for Dim Sum (Thanksgiving).  We only waited for 20 minutes.  We ordered Sui Mai, Beef noodle rolls, Curried Octopus, Tapioca shrimp and leek balls, fried shrimp dumplings and steamed shrimp and spinach.  Total bill $26.  Pretty good as the portion size was good.  We will more than likely return."}
{"text":"Wow, I'm surprised by some of the negative comments - although I guess anytime you introduce dim sum into the mix it's going to be all over the map.   I've been here three times for regular dinner and once for a dinner banquet ($700+ per table).  Every time I LOVED the food.   We've had conch sashimi, vegetables in broth, egg with shrimp, lobster with maggie sauce, cold Dungeness crab, duck with taro, Peking duck, duck or chicken lettuce wraps, fried oysters in honey sauce, sticky fried rice, etc.   The food here is sooooo good, and it's not just your ordinary dishes.....  Service has been great every time we've been...but we go with regulars so that might help."}
{"text":"This place is one of the last standing push cart dim sums and now I know why push cart dim sums are slowly dying out. Maybe it was my fault for coming late but the variety was lacking and because it push cart some  dishes became cold and soggy when it got to our table. I wanted to order some dishes from the waiter but I had to wait till the carts were all done. Basically u wait and your appetite disappears with it. The quality of dim is OK, I wouldn't say the best but not the worst."}
{"text":"Good for dim sum, come before 10:45 am and S, M, & L are all at the S price.  Has all the usual and quality good."}
{"text":"When this place first opened, it was great. Bubbling with people and staff that was competent. This location is top notch, large parking lot, grocery store beside it, across from a medical building, across from a large bank...it's a dream location for a restaurateur.  So how come so many have tried and failed?   The food is okay. It bears the same chef/owner as the Very Fair Chinese Restaurant (original name) so the food bears the same resemblance. But this Seafood restaurant specializes in just that, seafood. When walking in you are greeted with 4 gigantic tanks of king crab, various fishes and sea life.   I know the ins and outs of this business. I've come for dim sum, dinner, banquets, you name it. I have to say that they're winning factor is their banquets. Every time, it will always be phenomenal. Their A-game is brought EVERY time I've had a banquet style dinner here and I'm not talking about the 4 person set dinners, I'm talking about the multiple $300-$800/table banquet. Exceptional which is how it earned the extra star or else it would have been a measely 3 star review. The shark fin soup is so good, it's got tons and tons of shark fin that you can see and it's not too watery and not too thick of a consistency, it has found the happy medium.  Dim sum is another story. It's up and down. At certain times in the day it'll be better than others. Coming for \"early\" lunch will always guarantee a multitude of food and people. The perfect time to come is around 11am but be ready to wait a bit because this is their busiest time. A new addition to their dim sum menu are the beef ribs sprinkled with sesame seeds, love them! They even have the chef's special sweet and sour pork in little portions for you to enjoy.  Dinner is meh. It's not good, it's not great, it's just there. Again like I said in the review of sister restaurant Very Fair Chinese Restaurant http://www.yelp.ca/biz/very-fair-chinese-restaurant-scarborough I am a bit bias to what \"good\" Chinese food is. I'm certain that other people will think that they food is good-great but for me it's just good.  Few things this place needs to work on: - training the new staff better. Some of these people are completely clueless, it's really not that hard to be a waiter in a Chinese restaurant. Fill up the tea pot, make yourself available and clear plates, that's literally it. - adding more food variety during dim sum hours, especially between 12pm-1pm, most restaurants have this problem  I'm not going to stop coming here as this is our family's hang out spot. But if they don't take some good suggestions now, they'll end up like the 4 previous owners (all of which I have eaten at) and close up shop."}
{"text":"Great place for Dim Sum. The dim sum prices are competitive and the quality of the dishes are top-notch. The Har Gow and Rice Roll with Minced Meat are my favorite dishes. They are definitely very flavorful and a good size. Good customer service for a dim sum restaurant and the staff are very friendly and thankful for your business there. Decor is very nice and the restaurant gets very busy during peak times on the weekend. Overall, highly recommend dim sum place in Scarborough."}
{"text":"This review strictly is for their dimsum. It was an extremely pleasant surprise and has been one of the best dimsum experiences I have had in a long time. We were nearby and figured to finally try this place. While a tad pricey (come before 11 to take advantage of their $3 pricing for S/M/L items), it was worth it.   Notes: - Everything was piping hot and fresh - Taro dumpling was fried to perfection, extremely crispy on the outside! - Squid tentacles were melt in your mouth tender, I'm not kidding. First time I have seen them served with pickled radish and carrots; a nice addition/ palate cleanser - Ha gow shrimp was coated in this white sauce, creamy/buttery goodness. Amazing.  - Chicken feet/spare ribs rice was really good - props for actually having some greens! They also don't skimp out on the spare ribs and chicken feet as there were a generous amount given. Rice was amazing.  - Curry cuttlefish/beef ball/siu mai were average. Had better elsewhere/comparable to most places. Siu mai was tad larger than the usual.  For a weekday lunch, there were no problems getting a seat at noon and you can get by with minimal Chinese."}

{"text":"First dim sum I went to when I arrived in Toronto. Was quite a nice decor for dim sum compared to home.  The nice part was $3.00 per item before 11am but it made my mind wonder why one set of people deliver and don't do anything else but deliver food to table. Finding a real waitress to ask for water was a bit time consuming and sometimes hard to get service.  Food wise was very tasty and I probably will come again."}
{"text":"One of my favourite dim sum restaurants. Always lots of parking and good variety of dim sum dishes. The place isn't the fanciest but the food is still really good. I love their egg tarts and chicken feet.  This place can get pretty busy on the weekends but I tend to go on weekdays when it's more quiet."}
{"text":"I had a lovely time here. Maybe it was the company but it was great!!!! It's really bright and banquet hall-ey which was different. They had a party for someone's birthday or something in one of the rooms and the other room was for people just having dinner. Pretty sure i was the only white person there so WIN. The duck was sooooooooo good, they cut it up into slivers and give you all this stuff to make it into a small wrap with this delicious chewy paper. This makes no sense but whatever.  We ordered the $68 dinner combo and it came with soup (meh, standard, brothy), duck, wraps, then they take leftover duck and make some kind of stir fry with duck and what i believe are water chestnuts, then we had CHOOYYY bok choy in goopy sauce, deep fried MASSIVE shrimps, pork neck and we ordered white fish with vegetables.  Oh and also deep fried squid!  I really really liked the pork neck and the squid, the wraps were amazing and the duck skin SO GOOD. I tried to eat the duck's head. It was pretty violent...  I think we paid 25 each between 4 people, there was so much food. If i wasn't a machine we would have had a week's leftovers...."}
{"text":"I came here for dim sum on a hoilday, it was packed to a point everywhere was filled with people. It was almost impossible for you to walk over to the hostess stand since everyone crowds over the stand even after they have gotten a waiting number. Suggest everyone that goes on a weekend and especially holiday to make a reservation (especially table of 4 or more) because even with a reservation, you still have to wait!  ****They're waiting system is SUPER UNORGANIZED, where you see people without reservations and numbers get a table as soon as they walk in just because they know people inside working there.  They give you a sheet of dim sum paper as you sit down and you just mark off what you want to eat. They will also ask what type of tea you would want to drink, typically you can choose 2 because they serve 2 pots. On the sheet there will be a S, M, L, XL written beside each dim sum representing what prices they are charged at.  Once you have given your sheet to the server, they will come back with a printed list of what you have ordered. As they come place your dim sum on the table, they scratch out the ones they have placed at the table, keeping track you have received all your food.  They're food is average, nothing in particular that was super good or something I would order twice. But for the prices they charge and the food quality, I think it WASN'T so worth my money! You can basically walk in ANY other restaurants in the same area and find the SAME QUALITY food but for a CHEAPER cost.  Service is considered fast since they have plenty of staff working.  *** But I WOULDN'T come back to this location for dim sum or recommend any of my friends of family to this place, there's BETTER choices around this area!!"}
{"text":"I'm from Minnesota and in the Twin Cities, there isn't such a thing as good dim sum.  There is average dim sum, but not GOOD dim sum.    A few co-workers recommended this place for classic dim sum; so, I met up with them for what I was told was good food and great convo.    This place is located in the older Chinatown in Scarborough.  It's attached to a large strip mall; well, it's surrounded by strip malls now that I think about it.  It's also about 5 minutes away from Pacific Mall, a large local mall filled with Chinese owned stores/food/groceries.    Very Fair has the classic interior/exterior decor one would expect from a restaurant in the middle of Chinatown.  You make your way in, you're greeted by GIANT tanks of seafood, red/gold all over the walls and large round tables throughout the restaurant.  This place has the classic dim sum service, old Chinese ladies, pushing carts around and trying to make you buy more dishes than you really need.  We arrived before 10AM, which means it was only $2C per dish (that's a DEAL).    The food was amazing, simply amazing.  There were a number of items that I don't see back home in Minnesota that I had to get; fried quail and a few other things that I only know in Chinese.  On top of that, all the usual dim sum items were a billion times better than what I'm used too.    If you have a sense of adventure and want to experience an amazing meal, hit this place for great dim sum."}
{"text":"Visited with my family for a quick dim sum outing. Very prompt service for traditional cart dim sum, with high turnaround of fresh items. Bigger portions than most places, but this is also reflected in the price. Well worth the extra $ IMO."}
{"text":"A very fair seafood restaurant that deserves a very fair rating on Yelp lol.  The food is good and tasty, and the service is pretty fast. Most of the dishes that I've had there come in generous portions, and they taste, as the Yelp review says, \"A-OK\"! Good for big groups! We used to come here for our family dinners every week, so iz guuud."}
{"text":"Visited this place about 5 times already. Super busy place on the weekend.  Be ready to wait about 30 min before you can get table if you coming before 11am.  Very popular place, clean, nice decor and good Dim Sum. Their Har Gow very big and nice taste, deep fried shrimp dumplings delicious, Shao Mai  good size as well. Found only one dish  ( pan fried beef short ribs) has plain taste, good quality meat but not enough sauce IMO :). Everything else  is good! Price is about 20% more then another places and final check will include 15% of service fee (no tips after :)   ).  I like this place and will come again"}
{"text":"The dim sum here was all over the place.  Some of it was very good some were just ok.  The shrimp dumplings each had 4 whole shrimp, uncut, in them.  The rice crepes were not that great, they had fish rice crepes which is the second time I've had that dish ever and this one was made of mashed up fish, not good at all.  The other time I had it was a filet of fish, excellent and much cheaper!  We had a Dry Cooked Beef Noodle dish and that was done very well!  Enough of what chinese call wok hay.  Took them forever to get water to us and then to refill it.  They also don't have sugar and the waiters and waitresses really didn't care to help us at all.  I'm starting to get the trend that chinese canadians don't care to be good at service at all."}
{"text":"I believe Very Fair Seafood Restaurant is a sister restaurant of Very Fair Chinese Restaurant.   We ordered a dinner combo for 4 to feed 5 adults and 1 kid.  We were full, but not stuffed, without ordering rice.  Therefore, the portion was good.  The vegetable dishes were well made.  The fish seemed to be made from a dead fish, not live fish, but the meat texture was still okay, meaning the fish was fresh anyway.  The fish was overcooked and under-seasoned.  I don't recall anything about the meat dish, so I supposed it was not very memorable.   As opposed to many reviewers, I found the food barely okay here.  Things just could be tastier, at least for dinner they were.  All the ingredients used seemed to be okay fresh, but nothing really stood out.  Maybe I should try the dim sum brunch one day to get a well-rounded opinion.  Overall, this restaurant is good for regular family dinners.  The decor is definitely a notch better than the food.  The services are friendly and down to earth."}
{"text":"Came here for Dim Sum on a Thursday morning. The restaurant was packed as there was a very large line up. Luckily, we were able to be seated before 11am for the early bird special. The ambience is your typical dim sum restaurant with a little above average noise level. Service was not too poor for an Asian restaurant. As for the food, it was just mediocre. Except for the portions. They were larger compared to other Dim Sum places around the area. Personally, everything was a little too salty and over seasoned to my liking.  When it comes to food, it's quality over quantity for me. So, overall I think I might come back once in a while if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Another push cart dim sum. I know more dim sum places have adapted to ordering off a list and food is brought to you fresh but I always seem to like the push cart better. Its more fun the old fashion way. There was a lot of variety and the carts came around fast. Everything tasted good and have no complaints but nothing really stood out either. It gets the extra 0.5 for having the push carts.  3.5 stars"}
{"text":"A typical dim sum place. Brought my grandma here for dim sum on Sunday. I don't mind waiting cause it was expected but there's no seats for the elderly when people are waiting. Dim sum is norm for most older Asians for breakfast brunch and lunch. The staff is quite rude also.. will consider other dimsum places since the wait is the same.  Update****  We waited for 45mins apparently they give seats to ppl they know. Even though you got a number it means nothing."}
{"text":"Came here for a banquet and I would say things went better than \"Very Fair\".  The waiters served everything individually Most everything was well prepared in the beginning and sadly, the meal ended w/ overcooked fish and dried out chicken.  Also, say no to shark's fin!  I ate it mostly b/c it would've been disrespectful if I didn't but the restaurant really shouldn't even be serving it."}
{"text":"My mother came here with her friends on labour day weekend and there was a cockroach in their vermicelli dish! They took the dish away and replaced it with a new one and didn't even take it off the bill. Awful service AND ROACHES. Be warned.  Not sure how the taste of the food actually was but cockroaches make this establishment unrateable."}
{"text":"One of the many chinese restaurants that my family frequents, mainly for its large space, close location and very reasonable prices. My grandfather holds his birthday banquet there every year (that classic 10 course cantonese dinner affair).  I recently went again on a Sunday evening for dinner, so I will base my review on that since that's the freshest in my mind.  We had the 6 course Peking duck set menu. Definitely good value - for $68, you can feed 4 -6 people with soup, peking duck, fried prawns, pork neck with vegetables, stir-fried fish vegetables, and the meat from the peking duck also with vegetables in a brown sauce, all topped off with red bean soup as dessert.  PROS - good value, which is key to a chinese restaurant's success - big space, so it's pretty easy to get a spot. Sunday night we went was a bit unusual because there was a wedding banquet there, so we were relegated to one of the rooms on the side - good-sized portions - pork neck dish was very good! - I really enjoyed the way they cooked the remaining duck meat - with lots of vegetables, making for a large dish  CONS - prawns didn't seem that fresh - the meat was slightly soft and lacked the \"crunch\" of freshly cooked seafood. My mom said that it was better the last time she went. - rice was a bit hard - peking duck was ok... wasn't as crispy as it could've been - Service was BAD. ok, they were busy, and service is never that great in this caliber of chinese restaurants, but it was just bad that night. we had to constantly go find the waitress to order, and everytime we asked for something, she looked annoyed at us for asking. several times she told us she was too busy and will come back later. So maybe it was due to that wedding that night, but if they are planning to serve other diners the same night, they need to be staffed appropriately.  Overall, I would give it another try as long as they don't have a wedding that night. The food was fairly good overall, and for the price, I can't complain too much."}
{"text":"Don't expect them to be \"very fair\" with their lineup.  There is a much bigger non-lineup inside.  Count how many tables paid and left vs the numbers called."}
{"text":"Do you even care about your customer service? Why would you serve all your customers by speaking only Cantonese? There are customers from everywhere. I feel so ashamed for your rudeness. I'll never come again. Very very disappointed"}
{"text":"Great food, pretty meh name. Very hard to find that style of dim sum in Toronto with carts, freshly made food constantly coming from the kitchen and even waitresses are dressed in traditional attire. If you don't speak Cantonese however make sure you know what you want to get, not a place to really ask for recommendations from the waitresses.  Things to order if you're not sure: Hargow Sumai  Jian dui- trust me Soup dumplings Spare ribs"}
{"text":"Had a special group party there in one of their private rooms for dinner. Very reasonable \" fixed price group menus\" and there was plenty of food for everyone and everything tasted good. Friendly, courteous service."}
{"text":"Very good restaurant for dim sum. Dim sum special before 11am but you will need to go at 9am to get a seat. It is very busy even though they have over 30 tables. I would highly recommend the SIU MAI and their LOBSTER E FU NOODLES. Service was medium but it's what you expect of a Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here with my wife and inlaws for dim sum. We just waited about 5 minutes to get a table. The restaurant is spacious and the tables are not crowded together like other dim sum restaurants. We arrived around 12 so we did not get the specials, so it was a bit more expensive. The food came quickly and was quite delicious. The har gow was big.  The staff was also friendly. Will probably try it but before 11 to get the special"}
{"text":"These are not the good old days for this restaurant.  It was way better in the past ...  However, the pumpkin and chestnut congee was very good (excellent, actually) and the taofu from the lady with the wagon was fresh.  FORGET yum cha here!  The glory days are over regarding quality of wrappers.  THICK and just totally amateur.  The mai lai go was tasty.  I miss the old menu offerings.  Wait staff are EXTREMELY nice.  Kind-hearted Furen who are pleasant and accommodating.  Strong, rough tea."}
{"text":"The servers here are absolutely terrible. They are so disorangized and their attitudes need to go. They kept moving us around to different tables which was very unprofessional on their part. And the way they treated us was absolutely unnecessary. You're getting paid so do your job properly. I understand working customer service and all because I've been in their shoes, but they should be doing whatever to keep the customer happy. Also they include a fixed amount of tips to your bill and for the awful service they provide, it's just unfair."}
{"text":"10 course meal -- all the works like lobster, Peking duck, shark fin soup, pork, etc  Great service. Great food. Great company.   Not exactly sure how much as it was a birthday but I think the prices are fair there. Everything was really good except the efu noodles which has absolutely no taste whatsoever."}
{"text":"It's a very fair restaurant. Typical dim sum fare and fair service from the staff.  We went when they were preparing for a wedding that evening so they were very fair and made room for us before final settings on the tables.   The food came out fast and was tasty but nothing special really.    Would go there again if I was in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"The food is alright. Nothing special, but generally good.  Or should I say very fair?   Don't expect good service (or any service on the weekends). You'd be kidding yourselves.    Expect to ask for things multiple times or just get things yourselves (utensils and hot sauce are visible for the taking for example)"}
{"text":"pretty big chinese restaurant. i miss the lions that they used to have infront of the building, it was kinda part of my child hood. the dim sum was quite good though. it's pretty much what you'd expect. nothing super fancy. the most memorable thing for me was the durian pastry dessert. my sister was eating one as my brother-in-law (Caucasian) was telling a story, as soon as he finished the story, he had this disgusted face, looked around and said, \"something stinks!\" meanwhile, my sister and I who love durian and i personally don't mind the smell at all just start to laugh hysterically as he realizes what it was."}
{"text":"My mom was all excited on taking my brother and I to this restaurant for dimsum, oddly convinced that we would love it. Unfortunately, her street cred wasn't good enough for us to believe her and wake up at the ungodly cheap dimsum hour to go to Very Fair restaurant.  In fact, my brother and I were so lazy, that we didnt arrive at the restaurant until 11am (REAL brunch hour) and the prices sky-rocketed. From about $2 for every type of dimsum imaginable to $3-$6 per dish - averaging about $5 per dish. The three of us was billed at over $50. I guess it's \"very fair\" since we woke up so late.  In point-form: - lots and lots of variety - push carts don't stop - chicken feet was delicious - stir fried seasnail was cool - services were super good - food overall was decent - shrimps were not fresh as i broke out in hives - super expensive it is after 11am"}
{"text":"This review updated is based on dim sum experience. I have to give Very Fair Seafood Restaurant an extra star just to be Fair.  Not too many dim sum restaurants in Toronto hires ladies pushing carts serving dim sum anymore. This is the way that it used to be... you wait and wait and hoping that your favourite dim sum will show up... and sometimes they do, sometimes they don't. For the popular items, you might have to send your boyfriend/father/brother to get them... if not you might never have a chance to have them. The ladies pushing carts might try to sell you their dim sums.. since some of them are so unpopular and it can be going around and around and still no one wants it.  Having dim sum back then might take a long long time... and it might be the only time that some families would have spend time together on a Sunday morning slipping tea slowly and enjoying reading their newspaper.  Here dim sum specials are $2.20 for S/M/L before 8 - 11 AM 7 days a week. The dim sum here are A-OK!"}
{"text":"A family used to come here quite a lot, but for some reason stopped. Recently came by to check it out, because we heard they'd undergone some renovations. Despite the fact that the restaurant is located in a pretty seedy looking/deserted strip plaza, I have to say the inside (post-renovations) is looking quite spiffy and actually pretty fancy. They've opened up the main room and maybe installed new lights or something, so overall the place looks a lot bigger, roomier, and brighter.   We came here for dim sum around 1:30 PM on a Sunday, and only had to wait a little bit to be seated. That was probably the only good thing that happened, because after we put in our order, we just sat there... and waited... and waited. At some point, due to our growing hunger/hanger, we requested a staff to follow up on our order... only to never hear back from them again. A short while later, we gently inquired with one of the restaurant managers and half-jokingly suggested that maybe our order had gotten lost... to which she scoffed, \"Lost? Not possible!\" Of course, some poor little waitress eventually came by to apologize to us because a) two of the items we'd ordered were sold out and b) of course, they had somehow lost our order. Overall, it was a very unfortunate situation, but in the end we were just thankful to finally get our food.  Food quality was as expected just normal, standard quality dim sum. I did note that overall certain things seemed a bit salty, and I found myself very thirsty afterwards. Overall my family and I were disappointed with our recent experience here, because of the lacking service, mediocre/salty food, and price point which I didn't think was justified for a place like this in Scarborough. Yes, it looks considerably nicer post-renovation, but the prices are the exact same here as they are at Crown Prince ($2.80 minimum), which I think is still a better looking restaurant and also far exceeds this one in terms of service. We gave it a good shot, but not sure if we'll be returning again any time soon."}
{"text":"Needless to say the place was very fair (haha). Actually it was great, I was here for a banquet and the 12 course meal was impeccable as you'll see in the photos: roasted pig, fish, chicken, lobster, shark fin, abalone, and rice dishes were done well. Great service staff. Of course, my meal here wasn't the normal meal you would get, as it was a banquet, but if you're looking for a great Chinese restaurant to host your next gathering, these guys do it quite well and classy!"}
{"text":"Thank you Very Fair Seafood. My sister booked a table to celebrate my parent's 30th wedding anniversary. The price was amazing for a private room, above average food, and excellent service.  The place is a bit out of the way. And the restaurant could use some work here and there. But, I was happy. I would definitely come again."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a while and seemed like this place got a major (and well needed) upgrade. I was pleasantly surprised how much cleaner this place became - they've definitely upped their standards from the last time I came here.  Menu offerings were also heightened and saw some new items to try. Everything we ordered came in a timely manner and was hot and fresh which scored major points with me. Portion sizes were also good. Favourites were definitely their rice flour rolls - very soft and the texture was just right for me. The shrimp in their various dishes were also large. We also ordered a dish of beef noodle stir fry and was pleasantly surprised that it was relatively dry and not gleaming in oil like your other fast food places.   Only 2 complaints here - egg tart was super oily for some reason, crust was not good (I think they used wonton crust), I'd skip this dish! Service was also lacking, but it's what you come to expect from any Chinese establishment - waitresses kept avoiding eye contact with tables and we had to wait a very long time until someone would come take away empty plates, refill our tea, but no surprise that they were quick to grab us our bill. (Might I also point out they added a service charge to our table of 8?)  Overall pretty good place to come grab dim sum!"}
{"text":"It is a good place to go tea with family and friends. The environment is not bad. There is many choices on the menu as well. The taste also not bad."}
{"text":"Came here for yum cha. Nice place, good service. Very pricey. But portions are big and the food was good. Would come back. Want to try the special everyone is talking about before 11:30am.   Also had my engagement reception here with family. They manager that I worked with was nice, accommodating and gave me a good price. The device that day was good and food was decent. I did however over stock the the tables, so food was portions wasn't as big(for 12 people but would be good for 8-10) but with $525 a table it was not bad. Would come back for 10 course meal again but will reconsider the portion size and number of people different Ly next time :)   Love the decor of the tables and chairs... Maybe it's just me, everything was a shade of purple and I loved it. I didn't even have to ask for it :) their decor outside in the hallway is nice for group pictures :) flower covered heart shaped  gate was a very nice place for after meal group photo op."}
